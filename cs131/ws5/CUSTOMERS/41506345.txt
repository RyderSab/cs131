V. Cernenko is a fantastic introductory book on the Scythians.  The Scythians lived about the same time as the ancient Greeks, migrating out of the Iran area into Eastern Europe, leaving burial mounds as far apart as Mongolia and the Ukraine.  Although there are many questions about these people that may never be answered, they have left a fair amount of surviving artifacts.  Most impressive are the fine detailed gold objects.<br /><br />Albeit there are many unanswered questions on the Scythains, this volume provides an outline of their history, weapons, clothing, and battles.  The illustrations in this book are great, truly bringing them to life.  Their scale-mail armors and splendid weapons are an impressive sight.<br /><br />I found this to be among the fastest reading books in the Men-at-Arms series.  It left me wondering and wanting to learn more about these ancient people and their history.  I would highly recommend this volume to anyone interested in ancient armies.	2005-05-22

I would recommend reading this volume on the Ottomans before the other Osprey books on them.  The book chronologically covers the history of the Ottomans and the reader gains a sense of who they were and who they fought.  As you may expect, the volume is richly illustrated with photographs, woodcuts, paintings, and maps.<br /><br />Taking into account that the Osprey military books really are concise volumes and are limited to a specific number of pages, the fact that much of Ottoman history is quickly reviewed or even omitted is understandable.  However, the fact that several pages have white space without illustration is less excusable.  The 1683 Siege of Vienna is quickly glossed over leaving a half blank page at its conclusion.  Without a doubt, there was room to expand on this battle.<br /><br />My interest in the Ottoman Empire was learning who this foe was that attacked and troubled Europe, particularly Poland.  Interestingly enough, details of wars between the Ottomans and Poles are throughout the book.  On the cover of the book lies the dead king Wladislaw III at the battle of Varna 1444 and toward the end it briefly mentions King Jan Sobieski's assistance in the Siege of Vienna.  If you are hoping to find many of the details of the Polish and Ottomans, you are going to be disappointed as they are few and far between.  The lack of details is almost excessive as the book even fails to mention Sobieski was Polish.	2005-03-28

The chapters are told from the perspective of the various women, but not necessarily in chronological order.  Normally, we think stories proceed from beginning to end, but this is not how the story is presented in this book.  Overall, this approach is interesting because we already know some of the details and background of the family, then get even more information and insight later -- all strung together in an interesting way.<br /><br />The story is fairly sad at times as the younger generation dismissed their heritage and became less Polish.  It could be called ironic that the younger generation dismissed tradition and thought they are more intelligent or educated in doing something different, but their actions created more trouble and havoc than they ever would have expected.  In the book, the woman that moved away from her family and tried to escape her Polish roots ended up an alcoholic with a failed marriage.  No matter how much they tried to dismiss their Polish heritage, it still was with them and the choice was theirs if they wanted it to strengthen or decay.<br /><br />\\"Pears on a Willow Tree\\" is a great read.  Although the story is about four generations of Polish-Americans from the same family, I was disappointed that there was not more Polish-related things in the book.  Overall, there are a few parts that Polish-Americans readers may relate with, but they were few and far between.  There really is more on alcoholism than there is on being Polish.  \\"Pears on a Willow Tree\\" is a well-written novel that is occasionally sad, but amazingly chronicles the changes of generations.	2005-03-12

The book is loaded with Turkish words and names, so it can be a little confusing.<br /><br />Overall, I probably learned more useful information from his other book.  Essentially, there is a lot of attention placed on details of names and not enough attention on a general overview.  Regardless, it is still worth reading \\"The Janissaries\\" if you enjoyed Nicolle's other book on the Ottoman Turks and wanted to learn more about them.<br /><br />One thing that did strike me as being odd was the Turks were painted as being such tolerant people and that Europeans are somehow biased and dislike them.  The brutality, conquest, and their encroachment on their neighbors was absent from the book.  At least addressing the issue of what the Turks did to get their \\"terrible\\" reputation would have given a more complete picture of who they were.	2005-03-08

As usual, there is action, light romance, and suspense.  However, \\"The Californios\\" has a mystical side that has similar elements as L'Amour's book \\"The Haunted Mesa.\\"  Overall, the book is fantastic and one both L'Amour fan, and those new to his writing, will enjoy.<br /><br />The story is about a man trying to help his mother keep her ranch.  As she owes money to a scoundrel who would rather own her land, they are in a predicament.  Years ago, her husband went into the desert with a man called the Old One, the last of an ancient people, and returned with gold.  Now, they believe finding the Old One may help them again.<br /><br /> \\"The Californios\\" is an amazing book worth reading.  You will learn about life in the early 1800s California without trying.  Perhaps the most enjoyable part was the philosophical statements and the mystical elements sprinkled throughout the book.  Furthermore, the book peaked my interest in learning more about ancient people who were in America before the Indians.  To top it off, the suspense runs from the beginning to end and is truly exceptional reading.	2005-02-27

The book lives up to the typical Osprey \\"Men-at-Arms\\" series standards; it provides a brief overview, along with many photographs of paintings and sculptures, and contains color plates depicting various scenes.  The book is great as it draws from many accounts of ancient texts that mention the Sarmatians.<br /><br />The Sarmatians were a nomadic people that came out of Iran in ancient times.  There were various groups of Sarmatians, such as the Alans, Iazyges, Roxolani, Siraces, and Aorsi.  My interest in the Sarmatians stems from the 17th century Polish nobles belief that they were descended from the Sarmatians.  They even made their armor look like what they thought Sarmatian armor was like.  This book provided me with insight into this subject.  This book brushes on this topic, but by no means focuses on it and is only a small fragment of the information contained within this book.<br /><br />The authors state that for centuries it was believed that the Sarmatians were the ancestors of the Slavs, as they lived on the same land and as one appeared the other disappeared.  Furthermore, the authors state:<br /><br />\\"Linguists and archeologists have long dismissed this idea; but at the same time have turned up evidence of the seminal influence of the Sarmatians on Slav language, art and religion.  Indeed, it is now accepted that the Sarmatians merged in with pre-Slavic populations.  Both Serb and Croat seem to be Slavicised Alan tribal names.  The myth of Sarmatian origins took a strong hold in Poland, where the Alans had a minor presence. (p.39)\\"<br /><br />Dismissing this idea into the class of myth may be just a form of extreme skepticism.  It seems contradictory that the idea is dismissed, yet evidence in support of it has grown.  Perhaps, it just goes to show the ancient beliefs were accurate in some cases, and modern re-thinking only distorts us from the truth.<br /><br />Personally, I found it interesting that swords with ring shaped pommels were popular among the Sarmatians from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD, as my family coat of arms has a sword with a ring shaped pommel.s us from the truth.<br /><br />Personally, I found it interesting that swords with ring shaped pommels were popular among the Sarmatians from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD, as my family coat of arms has a sword with a ring shaped pommel.	2005-02-21

Kelly, is historical fiction set in Poland in the early 1460s.  A family flees their estate in the Ukraine, then part of Poland, after being attacked by Tartars and takes refuge in Krakow.  The Charnetski family is followed to Krakow as a bandit believes they hold a valuable treasure.<br /><br />The father, Pan Andrew, takes up employment as a trumpeter at the church that is known for its trumpeter that plays at each hour.  Joseph learns from his father how to play the heynal with the broken note.  Some two hundred years prior, when the Tartars were invading Krakow, the trumpeter played this song in the tower, but was cut short by the arrow of a Tartar.  To this day, in honor of this trumpeter, at each hour the same heynal is played and even cut short much as it was in the 13th century.<br /><br />Joseph befriends an alchemist and his niece Elzbietka, who help them find a place to live in the city, on the floor just below theirs.  As the story unfolds, the Charnetski's are sought out by the terrible Tartar bandit and unknowingly influenced by the world of alchemy.<br /><br />\\"The Trumpeter of Krakow\\" is categorized as a children's book (ages 8-12), but the vocabulary level of the book would make me think otherwise.  A motivated reader should not find this to be a problem.  The story is entertaining, so I would not dismiss it simply because it is labeled a children's book.	2005-01-12

The book takes place in the late 1790s, an unstable time in Polish history, when the nobility of Europe were loosing their power. The power of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was gone, and their neighbors (Russia, Austria, and Prussia), were slowly but surely dividing Poland amongst themselves and scheming to wipe it off the map.<br /><br />Wealth and humility; two words that seldom stand side-by-side. Yet such contrasts surrounded the life of Anna Maria Berezowska, who at 17, lost both parents and found herself alone, facing an increasingly troubled life and world. Living under the roof and rules of her aunt, uncle and cousin, Anna soon discovered her extravagant cousin's constant plots to jeopardize her life as but the beginning of her distress. Lies and deceipt ran parallel to Anna's innocence and loyalty. A shocking rape, an arranged marriage, an unattainable lover and a native country she couldn't bear to lose, soon turned Anna Maria into a strong, spirited and fiercely independent young woman, resilient to emotional and physical defeat.<br /><br />As great or tragic as the story is, it is one shared by all people of Polish descent, because their ancestors all went through such a turbulent time under the sword and guns of the invading armies. The grisly details of war, the invading army, are so vivid that one gets a sense of the times and their troubles. This story is just the recounting of one group of lives that lived in this time, and thinking these events are what one's ancestors experienced, makes this book very special to Polish people, regardless if their ancestors were peasants or nobility.<br /><br />The author has expertly portrayed this equally romantic and stimulating novel in a way which allows the reader (whether of Polish extraction or not) to feel as one with the time period, the historical conflict and the personal emotions and experiences of each character. Push Not the River is an exceptional novel, not soon to be forgotten.with the time period, the historical conflict and the personal emotions and experiences of each character.

One distinction between this book and others in the series is that the author presents some non-standard viewpoints and backs them up with references.  This being the case, this book is more scholarly than many others in the Men-at-Arms series.<br /><br />As you may expect from the Men-at-Arms books, there are many photographs, diagrams, and illustrations that bring an image to this time in history.  The weapons, equipment, clothing, and armor of the various types of cavalry are discussed.  Furthermore, the book explains that the cavalry itself was composed of more than just Swedes, as there were also a number of German mercenaries, Finns, and a small number of British mercenaries.  Color illustrations of various cavalry cornets (banners) are also provided.<br /><br />\\"The Army of Gustavus Adolphus (2): Cavalry\\" is a great reference for those wanting to learn about the Swedish cavalry of the 1600s.  The author attempts to set straight some possible misconceptions other historians attribute to the cavalry of Adolphus, which is not an easy task for 48 page book.  As Gustavus Adolphus was an influential figure in military history, this book is worth reading for those interested in 17th century military.	2004-11-21

As with other Osprey Men-at-Arms volumes, there is a lot of information in the 40 pages (including index) and serves as a great introduction to the topic.<br /><br />As good as an introduction this book is, the author does use some technical terms that may confuse someone new to the subject.  However, with a little work consulting a dictionary, one can get through most of this difficulty.  \\"Armies of the Ottoman Turks 1300-1774\\" also includes several maps, most of which are helpful (one of them is hard to read because it is jammed with the names of cities and it is hard to easily tell where the bodies of water and land meet).  Furthermore, a chronology of the conquests and losses sums up nearly 500 years of the rise and fall of the Ottoman Turks.<br /><br />I found this book to be a great resource in learning about the Ottoman Turks.  The costumes, arms, and armor of the Ottoman Turks are interesting and elegant.  I enjoyed not only learning about their military conquests, but also the images of who they were.	2004-10-16

Michener's novel \\"Poland\\" favorably influenced world opinion of the central European country, but at the time the book was written, communist Poland was not entirely happy with the book.  Then, in 1988, Poland's government realized the positive effect of his novel, as it accurately portrayed the country in its history, people, and thinking spanning nearly one thousand years.  People who have read \\"Poland\\" may be interested to read about the impact of Michener's book and insight into the book itself, which is recounted in \\"Pilgrimage.\\"<br /><br />Michener traveled on his pilgrimage with a small group of close friends that had great influence in those countries.  Arriving in Poland, Michener was bestowed the nation's highest civilian medal for writing the book about the country.  The author shared his ideas on the irony of at first being rejected by the country for his book and then welcomed back and thanked for it.  Later in Rome, Michener met the Pope for the third time.<br /><br />Although the book is short, it tells an interesting story that provides insight into who the author is and the dramatic impact that his novel \\"Poland\\" has had.

Eight full-color plates illustrated by Angus McBride really bring the Mongols to life.<br /><br />The book is only 40 pages long (including the index), but serves well in informing someone new to Mongolian history the basics of who they were and fought, and even their strategies on the battlefield.  The author has the following to say about the Mongolians:<br /><br />\\"No army has ever provoked such justifiable terror and loathing in its victims, or slaughtered so many of its vanquished.  No other army has made and later carried out to the letter strategic plans so grand as those conceived at the great kuriltai or Council of War in 1235, with simultaneous attacks on both Poland and Korea. (p. 3)\\"<br /><br />From reading \\"The Mongolians,\\" one gets a sense they were brutal warriors, with examples such as 700,000 people were murdered in 1221 when Merv was captured by the Mongolians (p. 6).  The Mongolians influenced history in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East with their invasions; this book presents this history well and makes learning about it interesting.	2004-10-08

Although the book is about messages from angels, it is from a &quot;New Age&quot; perspective -- not a Christian perspective.  As Uriel is supposed to advise: &quot;There are no mistakes, only different paths of learning&quot; (p. 19).  Much of the terminology in the messages sounds like a mix of mystical, occult, and pop psychology.<br />The book encourages meditation as the key to harmony in one's life.  The angels also state the truth is within and thoughts have causative power.  The phrase &quot;light and love&quot; was used very often.  Furthermore, the phrase &quot;the planet&quot; was used often, making me wonder if the beings the author was in communication with were un-earthly.<br />The underlining theme of &quot;Inspired by Angels&quot; is encouraging learning and spiritual enlightenment.  It was packed with philosophical issues and offered much to think about.  Most likely, the passages in the book one believes already will have meaning and the rest will not.  &quot;Inspired by Angels&quot; is worth reading if one is interested in what Sindra Jordan claims the angels have told her and is interested in learning from their philosophical messages.	2004-07-05

I learned more than I expected about the agendas and activities of feminists.<br />I am not a stranger to feminism, as I took undergraduate and graduate women's studies classes, and at one time considered myself a feminist.  While working on my second Masters, I spoke my views in class against feminism as I believed we were in a mature environment and graduate school was a place were one could question things.  The professor told me that the radical feminists I spoke about were the fringe minority and that I was being ridiculous.  \\"The Gender Agenda: Redefining Equality\\" describes the activities of feminists putting into action their culture shifting plot I spoke of in class.  These feminists are not harmless, but rather, in positions of power in the UN and EU.<br />These feminists claim men and women are the same in ALL WAYS (physically, mentally, etc.), they despise full-time mothers (believing all women should work in paid jobs if they want to or not), and they hate religions.  Religions stand in their way from the \\"freedom\\" to have sex with everyone and aborting any children that might result.  Religions, of course, do not approve of homosexuality and promiscuity, and therefore, stand in the way of the ideal feminist world.<br />The author brilliantly sums up these supposed seekers of equality:<br />\\"Ideologies should be judged objectively, but in studying feminism and the Gender Agenda, it is difficult to put aside the suspicion that the entire enterprise is a giant rationalization created by hurt women to justify their anger, grudges, and self-destructive behavior.  Their abortions, sexual promiscuity, rejection of motherhood, and lesbianism seem more like the acting out that results from childhood trauma than courageous self-liberation.  Sometimes it is easier to blame oppressive structures and demand that the world change, than to admit responsibility for one's own self-destructive behavior.\\" (O'Leary 15)<br />This book made me see what a truly dangerous movement feminism is.  The activities of the feminists would shock nearly everyone and this book describes them in detail.

I am sure there is some subtle nuance of difference, but overall, they seem more the same than different.<br />Although the author, to some extent, encourages people to find the truth for themselves and be free of mass-manipulation, Swerdlow finds little trouble in dictating what he thinks is true and how people should live their lives.  The book is filled with the author's opinions on what he thinks is right.  Because the book is full of advice, the author ends up overusing pronouns (\\"he/she\\" and \\"him/her\\"), which is annoying.  If written in the plural, he would have avoided using any gender specific pronouns and still pleased the feminists that cry discrimination when only the pronoun \\"he\\" is used.en only the pronoun \\"he\\" is used.	2004-05-09

The history and transformation of the Teutonic castles from wooden forts to red-brick castles is described.  Furthermore, the history of the rise and fall of the Teutonic Knights is covered.<br />Maps with the location of the Teutonic castles, color and black-and-white photographs of various Teutonic castles, several color illustrations, and a couple of floor plans make a vivid picture of the topic.  The color illustrations are fantastic and breathtaking, filling one with awe at the splendor these castles possessed.<br />First published in 2003, this 64 page book serves as an excellent overview of the history of the Teutonic Knights' castles that are located in modern Poland.  The book does discuss some of the Teutonic castles outside of the borders of Poland, however that is not its emphasis.  The castles outside of Poland are to be reviewed in part 2 of the book.	2004-04-12

As the introduction to the book says, if you are satisfied with believing what you know, this book is not for you.  I believe that if you are interested in taking a few steps closer to the truth, then you will enjoy this book.<br />The book is large (over 400 pages) and covers so much information that it is like reading 2 or 3 books in one.  The author takes a lot of conspiracy theory literature and sums it up in a way that is a great introduction to the subject for those who have not read much on the topic.<br />&quot;Rule by Secrecy&quot; covers various secret political organizations, Freemasons, banking, and how these groups dramatically influence our world.  The common thread of these groups is woven together and traced back to ancient Egypt and Sumer.  The amount of material is quite lengthy, and you are in for a great review of many topics and issues.<br />I found most of the criticism this book received was distorting what was said in the book and purely pro-establishment typical rhetoric (viz., what they want you to believe).  But one would expect this as &quot;Rule by Secrecy&quot; exposes such seedy public manipulation that, if known, would cause mass public outcry.  This is not to say some of the criticism of the book is totally off-base.  For instance, although the book has a &quot;sources&quot; section in the back, some of the quotes and references I looked for in the &quot;sources&quot; section were not there.<br />If you are a &quot;truth-seeker,&quot; Jim Marrs' book &quot;Rule by Secrecy&quot; is probably worth reading.  As the book quotes and mentions many other books and authors, it will serve as a good starting place for a deeper look into these issues.	2004-02-08

In the known airbases were some unserviceable machines for the Luftwaffe to attack.  With an intact air force, Poland used this power once the war proceeded.  However, the capabilities of the Polish aircraft at this time were much more limited than the German aircraft.<br />By late 1939 and early 1940, with the collapse of the Polish resistance due to the overwhelming odds, most of the Polish air force escaped to France and England.  While in France, the Poles re-grouped and flew French planes to defend France.  Then later with the Germans overwhelming France, the Poles fled to England to regroup.  The Poles valiantly defended England and fought the Germans, distinguishing themselves as fighters not to be taken lightly.<br />At the end of the war, however, Poland was handed over to communist Russia.  The fighting the Polish aces accomplished throughout the war, with the aim of freeing their country from German rule, was replaced by anguish at their country now being put under Russian rule.  Poland, in essence, was betrayed by its allies and handed over to the Russians.<br />&quot;Polish Aces of World War 2&quot; by Robert Gretzyngier and Wojtek Matusiak lives up to the high standards of Osprey military books.  This volume provides a concise, yet detailed, account of every major aspect of Poland's air force in World War II.  The book is filled with many black-and-white photographs and pages of color illustrations.  Within the 96 pages, the reader becomes acquainted with the accomplishments of the Polish aces and even what happened to them more recently.  Skalski returned to Poland and flew in their air force for many years, Zumbach became a smuggler and organized the Katangese Air Force in the early 1960s, and Gladych immigrated to America, obtained a degree in psychology and now works as a doctor in Seattle, Washington.	2003-12-10

First published in 1986, the story takes place sometime in the 1980's.<br />The story is about the escape of Major Joe Makatozi (also called Joe Mack) and his plight crossing Siberia.  Shot down by the Russians while testing an experimental aircraft for the Air Force, Makatozi is thought to have useful information.  After breaking out of a Siberian prison, he has to find warmer clothing, food, and weapons.  Because Joe Mack is part Sioux, he was raised to be able to survive on the land if he had to.  Makatozi befriends a few people and treks across Siberia, hoping to reach Alaska, with the Soviet Military close behind.<br />&quot;Last of the Breed&quot; is considerably longer than most of Louis L'Amour's westerns.  Although longer, I often found myself reading more than I intended to in one sitting.  This book shows L'Amour is not limited to only westerns, but excels in other genres as well.	2003-11-23

The stories often have princes, princesses, devils, and fools as characters.  Two of the stories have dragons in them (\\"The Oak Plucker and Mountain Topper\\" and \\"The Glass Mountain\\").  Although the legend of the dragon near Krakow is the most well-known Polish dragon story, these two show that it was not the only one.<br />This book is a great collection of stories.

Flagan and Galloway Sackett intend on starting a ranch, but the Dunns don't like the idea because they think they own all the land in the whole area and they don't like others coming in.

Although written over seventy-five years ago, the book is still relevant for today's readers.  The book paints a vivid picture of the mind of drug users.  The drug user's highs, lows, and sometimes strange thought patterns are described in great detail in this interesting book.<br />The infamous Aleister Crowley invokes a reaction with some people.  Some say he was strange and went off the deep-end with his involvement in Magick, the practice of using various techniques to exert control over the forces of nature.  If one is too close-minded to read this book because of the author's reputation, he or she would be missing a great read.<br />This story is supposedly based on truth.  False names were used to conceal the identities of the people in the book.  For instance, Aleister Crowley is called Peter Pendragon in the book.  Peter went to a pub and was socializing with some people he knew when he saw the woman that would change his life, Lou.<br />&quot;Across the moaning body of the blackmailer, I was looking at the face of a girl that I had never seen before.  And I said to myself, &quot;Well, that's all right, I've known you all my life.&quot;  And when I said to myself &quot;my life,&quot; I didn't in the least mean my life as Peter Pendragon, I didn't even mean a life extending through the centuries, I meant a different kind of life --something with which centuries have nothing whatever to do (Crowley 11).&quot;<br />This truly eloquent description of Peter's first glimpse of Lou reveals that Crowley was truly a master of language.  The book is written in such a clever way that the reader continues to want more.<br />Basically, the story is of Peter falling madly in love with a woman named Lou.  They run off to Paris and travel throughout Europe.  Lou introduces Peter to cocaine and heroin and they quickly become dependent on the narcotics.  When their supply of drugs runs out, the withdrawal troubles begin.  Lou's father, King Lamus, helps the two overcome their addiction by the application of practical Magick.  Both Peter and Lou find their true purpose in life and live happily ever after.<br />&quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; would be a beneficial source of information for professionals involved with the psychology of addiction.  Doctors, lawyers, police, and the average person would gain insight into the thought patterns of a drug addict from the first high, to the constant effort to regain the effects of the first high.  The craving for the drug, and how it is the only thing the user thinks about when he or she does not have the drug for a period of time is covered thoroughly.  How selfish and careless one becomes when he or she needs a fix is also mentioned in the book.  Peter lost his love for Lou because he could only think of the drugs.  He quickly knew this was wrong and constantly tried to regain his love for Lou.<br />If people are open-minded and enjoy challenging their beliefs, then &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; may be the book to read.

Attempting to wipe brains clean of &quot;undesirable&quot; behavior and reprogram new behavior, he kept patients in chemical sleep for weeks and months at a time, while they listened to tape recorded messages that repeated endlessly.  Furthermore, he exposed them to massive amounts of electroshock that resulted in brain damage in some recipients.<br />&quot;In the Sleep Room: The Story of the CIA Brainwashing Experiments in Canada,&quot; by Anne Collins, details some of the stories of Dr. Cameron's patients and how, more recently, they sued the CIA because it partially funded his work.  Cameron's work in &quot;psychic driving&quot; (the term he used to call his process) caught the interest of the CIA and it secretly funded the program for a few years.  However, Cameron continued his work after this funding stopped.  Because it was the CIA that provided some of the money for these experiments, it caused a stir in Canada, regardless of the fact that the Canadian government funded Cameron before, during, and after the CIA chipped in.<br />&quot;In the Sleep Room&quot; provided a sketch of who Ewen Cameron was and what his ambitions were.  I did not find the book overly critical of Cameron or Psychiatry.  Historical background was provided on Cameron's treatments, and overall, the book was balanced.  This book provides a good starting point for those interested in learning about Dr. Cameron and his infamous treatments.  It is also attractive reading for those interested in gaining some insight into the events that placed attention on the ethics of treatments and higher concern for the consent of treatment.	2003-09-27

Although it was hard for me to leave some of the characters behind as time moved on, the new ones in the next period turned out to be just as interesting.<br /><br />It is an interesting experience to read about how these three families developed through history and one gains a larger perspective on how families could progress to get to their present state.<br />This book is amazing because it reads easy like a novel, but also includes a great deal of history throughout the entire book.  The reader becomes acquainted with nearly a thousand years of the colorful history of Poland.  The details of the history of Poland are horrific, to the point that you wish they did not happen.  I kept reminding myself that these events described, or ones similar to them, did happened.  In the 800 years covered in the book, Poland was invaded by nearly all her neighbors.

More than half of this book is about Farmer's life before she was institutionalized, and only after 150 pages does it get into her psychiatric involvement.<br />This book makes a great companion to Farmer's autobiography.  Although Arnold does point out information that shows the autobiography may be inaccurate, for the most part, Shadowland does not entirely contradict the autobiography.  Shadowland is an important book to read for anyone interested in knowing more about what happened to Frances Farmer.	2003-06-29

For each name, the English spelling is given as well as various spellings the name has had over the centuries.  Additionally, the meaning, history, diminutives, and feast days of each name is given.<br />I read this book cover to cover and found it very interesting.  Unfortunately, some Polish names were excluded from the book.  Nonetheless, this book is a great reference on Polish names and their meaning.	2003-06-15

As the author described it:<br />&quot;These hospitals devised vast promotional programs -- aggressive advertising coupled with painstaking media manipulation and systematic kickbacks to counselors and others who might have access to troubled potential patients -- to create a whole new product niche: treatment in psychiatric wards for people who had never before been regarded as candidates for inpatient psychiatric care.&quot; (p. 11)<br />Much of the book is anecdotal.  The accounts of various people that came into contact with corporate mental health hospitals is shocking.  The reoccurring theme was that marketing was used to seek out as many people as possible and finder's fees were paid to those that referred people to the hospital.  Then the hospitals would keep people in &quot;treatment&quot; for as long as their insurance would cover the expenses, even switching their diagnosis to extend their stay.  Once the insurance money ran out, the patients were pronounced &quot;cured.&quot;  Occasionally, bounty hunters were used to &quot;escort&quot; people that were reported to be in need of mental health services, but only those with good insurance, of course.<br />One of the most important lessons this book provides is just how wrong the mental health system can get.  This book serves as a reminder that even recently, psychiatrists can throw all ethical concerns out the window for money.  Sadly, only treating those that had insurance coverage was a concern, and not those with genuine problems.	2003-06-06

The stories themselves are entertaining, yet are also very informative in learning about Poland.  Additionally, many of the legends take place in actual places that one could visit today.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about Polish culture.  These tales explain what history books cannot.  Which elements in the legends are true is left to the reader to question, yet undoubtedly, there is some truth to them.	2003-01-31

The book primarily discusses the case of Kenneth Donaldson, which was a Supreme Court case on the right of treatment.  The book discusses the various briefs of the case, elaborating on various issues.<br />Donaldson was institutionalized because he told his parents that the neighbors were trying to poison him.  Although his parents sent him to an asylum for this, Donaldson maintained he was not mentally disturbed.<br />The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) assisted Donaldson in attempting to gain his freedom, but in a bizarre way.  Although Donaldson wanted nothing to do with medication and shock therapy, he sued the hospital director because he was not receiving treatment.  From the data presented, I got the impression that the ACLU used Donaldson for their own ends, which was to strengthen the power of psychiatry.	2003-01-10

Mark Bedillion.  Mark led a very reckless life that hurt many people.  Mark was a womanizer, a drug fiend, and a lawbreaker.  His life got so out of control that his family decided to lock him up in a mental institution.<br />The many addictions Mark had were finally overcome when he turned his life around in drug and alcohol rehabilitation.  The author found the 12-step approach, with Jesus as his higher power, to be an effective way to overcome the addictions and problems of his life.<br />After freeing himself of his addictions, he went on to become a therapist, then hospital director.  Furthermore, he also became a radio talk show host that spread the message of the 12-step approach.  The end of the book is quite good because he shares his insights on mental health and clearly demonstrates that he has learned from his mistakes.<br />Although the title of the book is Psychiatric Survivor, this is slightly misleading.  Only after years of reckless living as a drug fiend and womanizer, that was becoming violent, did his parents decide to institutionalize him.  The portion of the book discussing mental hospitals is relatively small, although he does share his critique of them.	2003-01-10

The author recounts various adventures and troubles he experienced at work and chasing women.<br /><br />The book is fairly entertaining, and I even found one part hilarious.  However, the underlining themes of the book were his never-ending quests for pot, fornicating with women, and trouble holding a steady job.  I was surprised at the ending because it left the reader hanging without resolution.<br />If one is interested in a personal account of someone that went through the mental health system and found it to be a detrimental experience, then Insanity Factory may be of interest.  Yet, the book is not exclusively on this subject, and it recounts more various escapades with women and drugs than experiences in an asylum.	2003-01-07

Kumin	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The Book Title is Slightly Misleading	Philip Kumin is a Jewish man that went in-and-out of many mental institutions for most of his life.  When he was not in the asylum, he was a homeless drifter.<br />The first third of the book mostly discusses the author's family.  Although this part of the book does discuss himself, it also spends a lot of attention on his family in general.  Home life for the author was not pleasant, as his parents argued frequently.<br />After the first third, the book gets to the point where the author begins his experiences with psychiatry.  He first went to counseling at the suggestion of his mother.  The book describes the author's increasing frequency of therapy that his father did not think he needed, yet paid for anyway.  Eventually, Kumin is institutionalized on and off for a number of years.  His stays in the asylums were voluntary in nature.  Furthermore, the author describes himself as mentally impaired, and reports being diagnosed schizophrenic and depressed.<br />For a number of years, the author reports resisting taking medication, but also blames his inabilities on not taking them.  Eventually, Kumin decides that drugs are helpful for him, and he reports he still takes them.  Overall, I got the impression that nothing therapy had to offer really helped him. Institutionalizing him was to free his family of the burden of taking care of him, but did not really help him.  He eventually did pull his life together, but it was because of his own determination.<br />Although the author is critical of some aspects of psychiatry, such as being institutionalized and that the mental health system is flawed, the book is not overly critical of the field.  As the title suggested, I expected a stance against psychiatry and something less wishy-washy.  After all, Kumin had an affinity to therapy and walked into the asylums of his own will, which is hardly an inmate.	2003-01-02

I read the book thinking it would discuss some of the bias of social sciences; however, it mostly dealt with the &quot;hard&quot; sciences, to my surprise.  For example, it is very taboo to question Darwinism in biology.<br />The book discusses bias of science that may be surprising.  It may be expected that the bias would be research that excluded women as participants, and therefore a gender bias, as is the politically correct bias in science to expose.  Yet, this is not where this book leads.  The bias of science includes topical bias, such as ridiculing parapsychology experiments and the widespread avoidance of the topic.  There is compelling evidence in support of parapsychology, yet this are ignored by scientists and they generally discourage the further investigation of the topic.<br />Furthermore, the book discusses how scientists are not always so scientific.  They name-call and deride what they so not know, all the while wearing the pompous cloak of Authority.  Keeping in mind, these are some of the most well know scientists in their fields, not a few on the fringe.<br />If you are truly a critical thinker, this book is for you.  It will make you think again about how our knowledge base arrived at where it is and how it will truly progress in the future.	2002-12-18

The spiral of silence holds that social systems form consensus by threatening individuals with social isolation.  Individuals scan their environment for present and future distributions of public opinion in order to see which have social approval and which lead to isolation.  In other words, public opinion is nothing more than safe responses to controversial issues that are expressed in order to protect oneself from social rejection.<br />Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann's spiral of silence theory in essence posits that an individual's willingness to express his or her opinion is a function of how he or she perceives public opinion.  The spiral of silence theory is very influential in that it has produced as much research and probably more controversy than any other recent theory in the communication and public opinion fields.  Furthermore, most of those that support the theory and those that are critical of it agree that the theory is important because it is one of the first to link public opinion to the social context in which opinion evolves and because it presents an interdisciplinary approach for understanding public opinion dynamics.	2002-12-09

Using battering rams, sledgehammers and buzz saws, they smashed and cut their way into rooms and offices of the church buildings, where they conducted the most massive search and seizure in American legal history. During the long day, and far into the night (21 continuous hours), they ransacked church files, seizing and carting away almost 100,000 items. A 517-page report inventory was required just to list the things seized.<br />Did a search for the 161 allegedly stolen documents named on the warrant justify such a violent, large-scale incursion? Or were the raids and act of revenge by a powerful, centralized Government, whose corruption and malfeasance had repeatedly been challenged and exposed by the Church of Scientology during the past two decades? Was such a razzia -- in the police-state mould -- meant to be an objective lesson to any other group or individual who might dare to defy the growing tyranny of federal agencies?<br />In this informative and at times impassioned book, the author seeks the answer to this and to other urgent problems confronting everyone today. He reveals for the first time the full inside story of the raids, as told by eyewitnesses who were present when they were carried out -- both church staff and the FBI agents who testified later in court. Also related in this documented detail are the dramatic events which lead up to and follow the FBI forays.<br />One section of the book is devoted to \\"the incredible caper\\" in which, the Government claims, undercover operatives from the Church of Scientology infiltrated federal offices to steal documents pertaining to their church. U.S. officials remarked in awe that the operation would have done credit to the intelligence agency of a major country.<br />With the penetrating insight of a seasoned journalist, the author also examines the legal proceedings which led to the conviction of nine church leaders, now on appeal. Noting that two federal judges from the same U.S. district issued rulings diametrically opposite -- one declaring the FBI raids illegal and \\"Constitutionally intolerable,\\" and the other in supporting them, Mr. Garrison writes:<br />\\"The issue joined in these two judgments, and the events leading up to them, extend by implication into every church, every newspaper office, every home in America.\\"ry.<br />With the penetrating insight of a seasoned journalist, the author also examines the legal proceedings which led to the conviction of nine church leaders, now on appeal.

Caplan's book They Say You're Crazy: How the World's Most Powerful Psychiatrists Decide Who's Normal questions the validity of the DSM.  Although psychiatrists claim that their manual is based on science, this is not always the case.  Dr. Caplan describes how psychiatrists that decide who is normal &quot;...too often slot people into categories for politically, economically, and emotionally charged reasons while pretending that they are operating in a solidly scientific way&quot; (p. 34).<br />Caplan is a clinical psychologist and a feminist that criticizes mental disorders that are specifically for women.  Regardless of the author's motivation for fighting these &quot;disorders&quot; and speaking out against them, she exposes many startling aspects of psychiatry.  Disorders are voted into existence with little or no empirical evidence.  Caplan comments on the DSM:<br />&quot;To the untutored eye, and even to many mental health personnel, the DSM appears grounded in science, although many features that give this impression turn out on inspection to provide only a veneer of scientific sheen rather than genuine, carefully supported research. (p.186)&quot;<br />Perhaps the most interesting parts of the book were where the author describes her personal experience working with the DSM committees for PMDD and SDPD.  However, it is not much of a story because the committees did not really want her involvement, and left her out of most of the process.  This aspect of the book is a unique contribution to the works of DSM criticism.	2002-11-01

K. Eakman's speeches. There is some overlap between this book and her other two on education, but has plenty of new material to make it worthwhile.<br />The book also includes an appendix that contains facsimiles of various letters, questionnaires, and parts of chapters that are referred to in her other books. This appendix is very interesting reading. For those interested in what is really going on in education, all of Eakman's books are worth reading.	2002-10-31

The author of the book is a Christian that found psychology and psychiatry to conflict with his religion.<br />Although the claim of psychology deriding Christianity may sound unbelievable, I have witnessed this in action as an undergrad. Additionally, I found the field of psychology to be extremely materialistic.<br />The author explains in the book how he went from a \\"true believer\\" to a heretic (critic) of psychology. Seth Faber explains how and why he became disillusioned with the field providing a general overview of some faults of psychiatry.<br />The book cover why and how the church got to the point of accepting psychiatry's authority, explaining that there was a division of secular and religious, with the mind being secular and the soul being religious. The realm of the mind became that of the psychiatrist and the realm of the soul that of the church. Although this division ignores the fact that many mental anguishes are really spiritual crisis.<br />The underlining principle in why Christianity and psychiatry are not compatible is that psychiatry holds that mental health is adjustment to this world. This core tenet of psychiatry is in opposition to Christ's teaching that the way of the world and his way are in opposition. This assertion is supported in the Bible, as Paul said the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight (1 Corinthians 3:19).	2002-08-29

Books	5	20	37	N	N	darwinian evolution is based on twisted evidence	I heard Wells speak at UConn last semester and was impressed by the overwhelming evidence that the &quot;icons&quot; of Darwinian Evolution are not based off solid ground, but rather misrepresentations of the evidence, forgeries, and twisting the evidence to fit the theory (ignoring what does not fit).  This book is very clearly written and easy to read.	2002-08-13

Dawes, critically examines Clinical Psychology and exposes facts that many psychologists would rather have hidden. The author is an Experimental Psychologist and the 1990 winner of the APA William James Award. He is very bold in trying to uphold the truth and convincingly demonstrates what the title suggests.<br />Perhaps the most striking issue covered in this book is the discussion on studies that evaluate the efficacy of psychotherapy. In 1977, Mary Smith and Gene Glass published an article in American Psychologist which found that on a statistical level, psychotherapy works. Not that everyone improved, or no one got worse from treatment, but on a statistical level people were better off on the measure examined than someone chosen at random. Smith and Glass also found that the therapists' credentials (Ph.D., M.D., or no advanced degree), the therapists' experience, the type of therapy given (with the possible exception of behavioral techniques for well circumscribed behavioral problems), and the length of therapy were unrelated to the effectiveness/success of the therapy.<br />As Dawes states:<br />\\"In the years after the Smith and Glass article was published, many attempts were made to disprove their finding that the training, credentials, and experience of therapists are irrelevant. These attempts failed. (p.55)\\"<br />Very few books written by psychologists try to realistically look at psychology's flaws. Although psychology pays lip service to the concept of critically examining its tenants, it is seldom done. Mainstream psychology often dismisses books such as this one in passing as \\"harsh criticism\\" and ignores the message they offer.	2002-08-08
