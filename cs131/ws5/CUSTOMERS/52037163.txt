I have enjoyed Robin McKinley's books since I first discovered &quot;Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Blue Sword&quot;.  I generally would rate her books as 4 - 5 star efforts.  &quot;Sunshine&quot; is just not up to her usual standards.  I felt the plot was molasses oooozing out of a jar.  Sometimes a good blob would plop out but mostly the book left me frustrated.  (The cooking analogies will continue, so reader: Beware!)  <br />My dissatifaction with &quot;Sunshine&quot; is due to the heroine &quot;Rae&quot; better known as Sunshine.  This may be my personal quirk but I can't abide reluctant heros.  You've got this power; we know you're going to use it and you know you're going to use it; I have never read a book in which the protagonist doesn't finally acknowledge power and use it!  Why do authors bother to toy with the notion?!  Do they think this a suspence device?  Do they really believe that readers don't know where the plot is going?!  All of Rae's complaints about preferring baking cinnamon buns and muffins and deserts and cookies and decadent chocolate creations (ad nauseum)... is a waste of time.  If the author MUST make an obligatory bow to the value of ordinariness then she must, but for heaven's sake get over it and get on with the plot!<br />The world McKinley creates in &quot;Sunshine&quot; is interesting but'way too sketchy!  Is this a future earth, a parallel earth, another world entirely...we never know!  There are clearly back stories on many of the secondary characters - the author makes that very obvious - but we never find out about them!  Very little but the immediate danger is ever resolved.  It's not like there wasn't room for some explanation; McKinley could have lost just a few pastry descriptions!<br />The only character that was at all interesting was Constantine - the &quot;good&quot; vampire.  Finally, an author who writes a vampire story that doesn't include an undead hunk, as unlikely a scenario as that would be - he's a walking corpse for heaven's sake!  But we know too little about him and spend too little time with him to rescue this &quot;half-baked&quot; book.	2003-10-06

I was so looking forward to Perry's new series.  Although her foray into SciFi was horrendous, Perry has had her Victorian mystery series down pat: great plots, wonderful characters, incredibly vivid recreation of the times...<BR>I thought &quot;...Perry's got a new stage to move new characters onto...should be great...&quot;  Wrong!  The vivid recreation of the times is here: a sleepy, self-satisfied, wonderful, upper middle class England right before the horrors of WWI.  All those bright young Oxonions - golden in the British sun - before they go for cannon fodder in the trenches of France. Perry's got it 'spot on' and I gave her two stars for painting a great picture.  A novel, however, needs to do more than paint pretty picture (or ugly ones, for that matter.)  The plot was plodding - no excitment...no breathless page turning...it was dull.  The characters were boring and stupid (especially the ones who were supposed to smart.)  The female characters (heretofore a real Perry strength) were particularly lame: stock English countrywomen with no brains or little wit, contrariness for the<BR>whim of it...my skin crawled.  And the dialogue!  Perry spent PAGES over internal conversations about faith that had little impact on the mystery that lay at the heart of the plot. I have no problems with religion as a central factor of life...I believe that it is underrated as a motivating factor in most lives and in most novels...but not just rambling musings. I don't care if the character was once a minister; a sane character has to muse at least semi-coherently.  If the author wants to write a religious tract, let her do so and keep it out of her novels.  Is Perry a recently born-again something?  I hope this series improves with later releases(which I will purchase used or in paperback)but I don't have much hope.	2003-10-02

This novel, set in the Honor Harrington universe, is a winner!  More intrigue than space opera, this is not a book for the techno-lovers who eat up Weber's 10 page descriptions of ships and weapons.  This collaboration of Flint and Webber gets on with the real business of a novel, the story...which is ultimately about people not machinery.  I heard more of Flint's voice in the dialogue than I did Weber - which I feel is all to the good but I think the story line and some character development is more Weber than Flint.  Whatever!  It's a good book, with a great plot, characters and dialogue.  The Victor Cachet character lives and breathes as only Honor has in previous books.  I am giving this book four stars and not five for two reasons.  The question of governing a new world has an unlikely solution - the authors try for justification but I couldn't buy it.   Secondly, the back story can only be found in a number of short stories from different volumes of short stories set in the HH universe.  Unlike the HH novels, I don't have all the short stories and I felt I was missing something.  I will say that I gulped down this one so quickly that I was forced to re-read it immediately just to do it justice.  I don't do this very often.  I am really looking forward to the sequel(s).	2003-09-30

She is whiney, illogical, pouty, thoughtless,  nasty,...and of course, a \\"troubled teen.\\"  The animals seem to love her but I can't figure out why.  The very similar psychological trauma that took an entire novel to gradually resolve for Storm in the original novel is switched off for Tani by a hug and an \\"ah ha\\" moment.  I always thought Hosteen was sexy but I had no idea that one hug from him could turn around 13 years of negative conditioning.  What a guy! And we are expected to believe that a mature, strong, talented man of 26 is going to match-up with our childish Tani.  No way.<br />The background and action of the book is fine - which is why it got 2 stars from me instead of one.  The view of life in the Nitra village was the best part of the book - if a little too naive.  \\"Death Which Comes in the Night\\" and the return of the Xik threat was a great plot device that could have taken more pages and built more tension but certainly worked.<br />The weakest part of the book, besides our so annoying lead character, was the dialogue.  It was wooden.  The short, simple declarative sentences must have been written for the virtually illiterate market. Maybe Tani wouldn't have been so bad a character if she hadn't been made to speak and think such dribble...	2002-09-20

The FireLord and Serpent's Shadow were well-crafted novels with compelling characters.  Their basis in well-known fairy tales was more implied than plotted point by point.  The GATES OF SLEEP has neither of these strengths.  The story follows the fairy tale slavishly through most of the book, along with all of a folk tale's plot weaknesses.  The character of Marina (I'm amazed she wasn't call Rose or Aurora.)is too air-headed and passive through most of the book to be appealing to me.  The relationship with her 'prince' is thin, very thin, almost non-existant thin.  This is fine for a fairy tale but not a fantasy novel.  Admiration turns to love for the hero all too quickly and I can't recall when or why Marina loves him.  The fact that he is an elemental master is so serendipitous as to be a very silly plot device.  Are Elemental Masters behind every bush and shrub in England? The \\"evil fairy\\" was the greatest disappointment because the character showed the most promise.  A female 19th century industrialist destroying her work force for the power they can provide her?!?  What an opportunity for a new kind of evil!  But Lackey fails to capitalize on a great concept and we never really understand why or entirely how \\"Madame\\" commits her crimes.  Marina's parents and the \\"good fairies\\" are amiable non-entities, for all their supposed powers.  Instead of confronting \\"Madame\\" with her curse and enlisting the other Masters in the effort, their only response is to hide the poor child away.  Okay for a fairy tale but this is unlikely in the Elemental Master universe that Lackey has created up to this book.  Wait for the paperback or buy this used from other disgruntled readers if you must have it.	2002-06-12

In the course of her search (in 5 volumes), Acorna has encountered a number of people - very few of them with any socially redeeming value.  The few new characters introduced in the later sequels are almost entirely nasties, if not outright villeins.  It seems that McCaffrey (or someone) is determined to show that all peoples, particularly those from a venerated past, are mean, low and self-centered, particularly scientist types who really want to either exploit or explore our heroes without their consent.  I'm not sure where this is going but I sure hope McCaffrey and her heroine get there fast.  Sometimes characters and plot lines have a half life - I believe this one died two books ago and is starting to smell.	2002-03-08

I really enjoyed this collaboration of Lackey, Flint and Freer.  I had been rather disappointed with Lackey's latest offerings (except The Serpent's Shadow)and, while I love and adore Flint, his books with Freer are lightweight bordering on silly. This book really worked for me.  I couldn't identify the various authors which is often a problem with collaborations and the plot moved seamlessly from one story line to another.  Unlike other reviewers,I had no problem with following the plot, the characters or the intrigue and I don't believe other Lackey or Flint fans will have trouble either.  Nor is the Shakespeare reference difficult for any high school student who has read Romeo and Juliet!<br />The story, set in an alternate world Venice, is an adventure, a fantasy, a court intrigue, a romance, in other words, something for all tastes but in a unified package with great and sympathetic characters. Don't let the heft of the package put you off - The Shadow of the Lion is long but well written, using an easy to read vernacular. Highly recommended.	2002-03-08

'Way too many coincidences than is good for a character or a plot line. I mean, really!  Skif must be the only orphaned waif/abused child in literature who stumbles into the clutches of a good version of Fagin - regular baths and three meals a day!  I could almost hear the poor boy intoning &quot;please, sir, could I have some more?&quot;  Only in &quot;Take a Thief&quot; the poor beggar gets more.  Deus ex Machina rules!  Skif always seemed to be a character with a slightly damaged soul - and an interest in revenge.  This is a less serious book than Ms. Lackey could have written about this character.

I still have the old paperback publications of these books which deal with opposite ends of time: man's conquest of the stars and his retreat. It seems to me that everything from the original publication is here.<BR>&quot;Star Guard&quot; is a book that has stuck in my memory from my youth. It featured Norton's patented great action and strong characters. I hadn't read the book for years and expected it would lose something on this rereading. And it did, to some degree...it seemed much shorter now. I realized as I retraveled an alien world with the human mercenary troops of the &quot;Star Guard&quot;, trapped, abandoned by &quot;Central Control&quot; and dying but always striving, how sophisticated Norton's juvenile's were and are. A happy ending for the hero, yes, but plenty of trial and loss along the way.<BR>I have a slight preference for &quot;Star Guard&quot; over &quot;Star Ranger.&quot; The mercenaries of the first book may be taking their lumps but they're considered a &quot;young&quot; race. The humans of &quot;Star Rangers&quot; seem old and tired. Not so much our young heroes but the civilization as a whole which I found rather depressing when I was a kid and still do now. Still the action and great character development is here. It is in &quot;Star Rangers,&quot; I believe, in which Norton first writes about the strong human/alien bonds, team work and tolerance which will become signiture features of her later books.<br />One thing I did notice as I reread these books was the absolute<BR>gender bias in these early books that I was not aware of as a teen. There are no women characters in the first book and virtually no females until the end of the second book. Although strong female characters soon appear in Norton's novels, these early works were &quot;supposed&quot; to be written for boys by boys...thus &quot;Andre.&quot; The dark secret of the sex of noted women scifi writers is laughable today but seemed important back then. I was considered odd for reading scifi. If you don't own these books, I would suggest getting them to complete your Norton collection...and as a good introduction to her juveniles for all your teen friends.	2001-09-05

This is an amusing book, with amusing characters who are constantly in the midst of amusing mayhem, murdering mostly deserving folk for profit...but it's no more than that.  I even laughed out loud a few times...not often, but a few times.  Do you understand my problem?  <br />This book has a lot of wasted potential.  It was like a series of short stories strung together with very thin connecting material.  It's a very light weight tale, unfortunately in hardbound, with spotty, but amusing, character development.  This wasn't up to Flint's usual standards...but amusing, rather amusing.	2001-07-10

I loved this series from first to last but all good things must come to an end.  The authors have now got groups of characters in too many far flung locations. As they each depart for parts known, the thought comes to each that they may never meet again...sob, sob...yuck, yuck. This is getting stale.  I'm also afraid that the some of the scenes in Maratha, the Sind, the coast of India, the Red Sea, Malwa, the Hind Kush, and on and on are more sound bites than plot lines.  <br />To add interest (and pathos) to the plot, without adding new characters, the authors have decided to kill off a few folk (I won't say which ones).  Two deaths were due to the chances of war...unfortunate but the series would be totally unbelievable if none or very few of the good guys died...bad guys can always drop like flies.  The other death was due to causes that I do not believe were consistant with the character's development ...and that is a flaw.  Finally, I'm getting the impression that someone's contribution to this volume went a little gadget crazy this time.  Too many pages were spent describing the new gadget and traveling with it so it can effect large destruction of Malwa property.  I appreciate that this was to some degree the raison d'etre for this series but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. <br />Frankly, I did not like this book as well as the others.  It's still a 4 but I hope that the series ends with the next volune.  I think that the authors and these characters and this situation are running out of steam.	2001-06-18

I remember the first time I saw &quot;Around the World in 80 days.&quot;  I was quite young and thought it was wonderful.  Many years later, I saw the movie again and realized that it was a travelogue with brief incidents in a variety of countries rather than a real story about real peopel.  &quot;The Great Ellipse&quot; is alot like that...fun but no real substance.  Don't get me wrong...I love fun!  But even in a fun book, you've got to like your heroine - and you end up dismissing Luzelle.    The story begins well with Luzelle defying her monster father.  Unfortunately, Luzelle is a self-proclaimed intellectual and explorer and her thoughts and actions are too air-headed to make this assessment reality.  Throughout the entire book, Luzelle's adventurous past comes through for her only once.  She is much more likely to act out of pique because someone gave her unwelcome news or sensible advise.  She feels she MUST win and proceeds to pull some nasty stunts on the other racers.  Our hero, Girays, Luzelle's ex, is clearly far more competent, honest, and likeable than the man Luzelle describes or Luzelle herself.  You must, therefore, take Luzelle's character with a large grain of salt which diminishes her stature in the eyes of the reader. Girays makes a more logical focus for the plot but he doesn't appear as much as Luzelle.<br />The real oddity in the story is a golden god of a man who is racing for the enemy, Karsler Stornzof.  Luzelles thinks he's just 'gorgeous' and you wait to find he has feet of clay.  Well, he doesn't.  He is all the things he's supposed to be: kind, loyal, honorable, brave, smart, talented...he just happens to be representing the local equivalent of Nazi Germany.  The story progresses and Karsler becomes more and more torn by his own loyalties as his country destroys, tortures, bullys it's way across his world.  It is his character, the only one with any depth, that is the biggest weakness of the book.  His tortured soul makes every other character a comic book cutout, which is hard on a plot centered around another character.  <br />So, what is the bottom line on the &quot;Grand Ellipse?&quot;  It's &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; with Hamlet in a supporting role.	2001-06-14

My old copy is held together with rubber bands.  I liked everything about it.  All the characters were wonderful; the history was accurate; the mystery and intrigue were mysterious and intriguing.  The secondary characters were almost better than the main characters.  Good wasn't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and, sometimes, even strengths.  You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them.  When the hero finally wins his lady's love, it's a timeless moment. Her love is an achievement...not a casual tumble in the normal historical bodice ripper.  My only complaint about this book was it was too short and there's never been a sequel.  If you can find a copy, read it - you'll love it.	2001-06-14

I really liked the first volume of this joint project by Norton and Edghill.  The combo of a Regency Romance and an alternate world was delightful.  This effort, however, is rather leaden, poorly planned and jerky.  There are fewer 'real history' cameos (outside of DeSade and Lafitte who are major characters.)  The likelihood of a Duchess running off to the new world, no husband, no retinue...and no recognition when she gets there is a major stretch.  The whole grail &quot;quest&quot; is silly, particularly Merel's survival in the wilderness!  The Duke's angst is getting overdone - particularly his fear of assasination by his own people.  A Duke?...really, now. I hope the series returns to Europe and to court intrigue and magic.	2001-04-17

Maya's character - a female physician treating London's &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; to make ends meet and still minister to the poor - is quite new.  I thought the crew of animals was a bit overboard but I enjoyed all the other characters. I felt the bias and conflict within both the London magical and medical establishments was well portrayed and accurate - for a fantasy.  The Sayers reference and the incidents of the deaths of suffragists due to forcefeeding strengthened the book.  Development of the romance was a bit weak but otherwise a good effort. I would be interested in a sequel.	2001-04-17

Although I ordinarily review scifi, I also read alot of mystery and romance, particularly romantic mysteries.  Jane Ashford is not Jane Austen but this regency romance is a charmer that I have reread a number of times!  I loved all the characters, particularly the hero's brothers, who are desperately in need of romantic assistance.  The youthful urges and emotions of the principals underminine their best resolves to keep their relationship on a professional level and they are only fooling themselves.  The heroine's backstory and the real basis for the mystery are tragic but this provides a weight to the novel that is needed:  &quot;The Bargain&quot; might float away without it.  All in all, one of my favorite romances...Ashford's other novels don't compare although &quot;Charmed and Dangerous&quot; comes close.	2001-02-07

I don't  review most of them but I have to share my absolute pleasure in this  series.  Except for the Honor Harrington series, I don't read much military  sf.  I don't recall why I decided to try this series - my experience with  Drake has been mixed - but I did.  I can truly say that this series is  fabulous! I can't remember the last time I finished a chapter in a book and  said aloud &quot;this is great stuff.&quot;  There is hardly a flaw - even  the history is accurate.  The last time I knew I had something this  enthralling was reading David Eddings.  I am sure I'll be re-reading this  series and sharing it with my friends.<br />In terms of this particular  volume, I believe the authors handled their task well.  The growing number  of characters and their far-flung locations does slow the action a bit but  makes up for it by introducing some interesting developments in terms of  lives and romances.  At my last count, we had 4 separate major action  locations and plot lines.  Frankly, that's enough or the books must be  longer.  This is a danger. As I said in reviewing another book, separate  plot lines are fine, as long as they are plot lines and not sound bites.   Otherwise, to the authors: keep up the good work and words!  Wonderful  Stuff!  Read it. Now!	2000-09-05

I fell in love with Ross Murdoch many years ago as he snarled his way through TIME TRADERS.  (I was fourteen; he was eighteen, or there about...a romance made in scifi heaven.  Don't tell my husband!)  I always greeted  his reappearance in the sequels in Norton's Time Travel series with joyous  daydreams.  I thought he was rather sulky in KEY OUT OF TIME but I forgave  him.  FIREHAND, the book prior to ECHOES IN TIME, was a good read, if a bit  poorly paced.  Ross had finally grown up, matured and, in the end, married.   It wasn't me, and I thought her rather cool but as I was a grandmother by  this time, what could I do but bid Ross Godspeed and good luck.  I was  unaware that some evil power was planning to feature my hero in a BAD BOOK!   ECHOES, unfortunately, takes all of FIREHAND'S weaknesses and magnifies  them.  The pacing is terrible; the plot can't decide whether it's about a  marriage or a space adventure; and unlike, FIREHAND, I didn't like alot of  the other characters.  Which leaves me to wonder: how much of this was  written by Norton and how much by Smith?  Ms. Norton, if you're going to  bequeath my Ross Murdoch to another author, please find one that can WRITE.	2000-07-21

In WHEEL, Ms. Wells has created a whole new world fully realized, with  patches of Earth cultures (I recognized India among others) but in a new  stew...and Ms Wells bubbles it for all she's worth!  The plot line follows  a more conventional &quot;prevent the end of life as we know it&quot; plot  line than her better books. This reduces the ability of her characters to  relax and just be people (as opposed to heros and heroines) for brief  moments.   She has used the devise of the traveling players before but  integrated them into the action more this time.  The relationship between  Maskelle, the troubled Voice of the Adversery, and Rian, the very skilled  but outlawed bodyguard is strong and unusual:  she is considerably older  but maybe not wiser.  There are lots of plot twists and turns, a few  surprises and a few not-surprises that were supposed to be.  The last  quarter of the book got just a bit murky but recovered with a sharp ending.   This isn't Martha Wells' best book but as few other writers come close, I  wouldn't let that worry me.	2000-07-10

I read DERYNI RISING during labor with my daughter, who is now married with children of her own.  I was reading THE BISHOP'S HEIR while in labor with  my son.  That was fifteen years ago.  And while labor and pregnacy can seem  endless, NOTHING compares with the 10 year hiatus we have endured waiting  for Ms. Kurtz to finish her story.  Poor Kelson, our handsome, noble,  powerful, kind, young, yadayada king can not hold onto a bride.   Considering the title, I'm not giving too much away if I say that third  time's a charm.     There's alot that's really great about this book.  Ms.  Kurtz explores great new cultures and de-demonizes the Torenthi.  The  political intrique is intriguing, although the Liam's Torenthi uncle was  clearly a good guy from the first.  I really liked Kelson's new bride,  mostly because Rothana and her guilt (and eternal whining) were really  getting on my nerves.  Kurtz does a good job of explaining why Rothana  REALLY can't marry Kelson - not the nonsense she spouts about it.     Problems?  A few.  I wish that Kurtz had taken a bit more time with the  relationship between Kelson and &quot;his bride.&quot; Couldn't she have  given them a bit of an adventure together?  Jehanna's seachange is rather  short-changed.  After so many years of fananticism, ignoring facts and  logic, she throws away &quot;salvation&quot; for a pair of eyes?  I don't  think so.  Another thing, what happened to Morgan?  He was so powerful and  talented in the first three books and so whimpy and conservative in the  last few.  I know the focus has switched to Kelson but poor Morgan!  Not to  mention, poor Derry...the eternal bad guy's deus ex machina...the trusted,  warpable human lord.    Still, practically everybody's here and ending  happily; the new countries are an intriguing patchwork of our world  cultures and Kurtz's invention; most of the bad guys are punished and the  heroes get the girls.  Whatmore can you want in a fantasy!	2000-06-15

Reading Ms. Wolf's latest is like reading two or three of her earlier books.  This isn't a new book -  it's a patchwork quilt of her previous works.  There is a line about Helen  and Hecuba that is right out of A SCOTTISH LORD.  It's a good line but,  unfortunately, you can only use it once.  Alexandra reminds me of Catriona  from THE REBELLIOUS WARD and the obsessive cousin is a complete lift from  AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.  If you have read none of these books - you'll enjoy  this one, although it's not one of her best.  But if you have read the  earlier books, I'd advise skipping this one - unless you have a thing for  echos.	2000-06-09

Most of the other reviewers seem to really love this book...but then they also seem to love the other books in this series of retold (rehashed?) Greek Myths.  I didn't and haven't.  I truly suspect that Ms. Gellis isn't  the primary author of these books!  From BOND OF BLOOD, through the  Roselynde and Heiress series, I hear Ms. Gellis' voice in her characters: a  consistant standard of writing, plotting and excellent characterization.  I  don't hear that in these books.  All Ms. Gellis' characters usually act and  speak with great consistancy.  When they do not, their actions are  explained. (In fact, she make an inconsistancy of behavior a major plot  device in one book.)  Her medieval and regency heros and heroines are three  dimensional and vivid.  The gods, demi-gods and their lovers in this recent  series are cardboard cut-outs,usually lacking everything that makes a good  historical or a good romantic character.  It seems that the author (whoever  that may be) turns legends into a people and then doesn't really know what  to do with them and the plot to get the story to that oh-so-necessary happy  ending. I've struggled through the four books in this series - I'm giving  up the fight.	2000-05-15
US	52037163	RKACFXCDNDWPX	0345434668	224574716	Pegasus in Space	Books	3	27	28	N	Y	&quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; - adequate end to a great series	First off, let me say that this is not a bad book, even at hard-bound  prices.  The problem is that it would have been a better book if it had  been twice as long.  Let me explain.  The plot is a series of snapshots of  exciting or emotional episodes with very thin connecting material. The  &quot;connecting material&quot; in SciFi or any speculative fiction usually  describes how the people live and relate to each other when they are not  under stress.  It's often a better and more rewarding read than the action  sequences.  The connecting material wasn't used effectively in  &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; and that's a shame because Ms. McCaffrey is  one of the best at creating a society and having her characters really live  in it. <br />   On the other hand, Ms. McCaffrey seems to be concluding her  extended plot lines in all her series and &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; is  worth reading just for that.  The characters we met in &quot;Pegasus in  Flight&quot; return and grow up.  The real character problem here is the  villains.  I just can't buy good ole FlimFlam managing to have the freedom  of the space station and arranging the big accident.  He's not that smart -  all the characters agree.  And while our &quot;darling&quot; Ludmilla,  Queen of the Space Station would be smart enough to pull off a small coup -  no one's stupid enough to believe they could pull off a large coup in a  telepathic environment.  Space stations don't get &quot;taken over&quot; I  don't care how many &quot;top&quot; people are attending the opening and  available as hostages.  &quot;Top&quot; people don't arrive without their  own body guards.  And if the body guards can't come, the celebrity doesn't  arrive, either.  Further, conspiracies that large fall apart under their  own weight.  Honestly now, Ludmilla is NOT a subtle kind of gal. <br />    Finally, though, Peter Reidinger is a wonderful character.  McCaffrey  matures him beautifully in the course of this book.  I was disappointedin  his relationship with the whimpy MD.  I preferred Amariyah - she had much  more personality but that's a quibble on my part.  One final point, was  Major Johnnie Green always so conniving?  I don't recall this from the  prior book.  Oh yes... and how come we never see his wife?  <br />   Unlike  &quot;Pegasus in Flight&quot; which could have been read separately from  &quot;To Ride Pegasus,&quot; &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot; is a close sequel  to 'Flight.' It must be read first for the new book to make sense.  Both  prior books are superior, especially 'Flight,' but &quot;Pegasus in  Space&quot; is certainly acceptable entry and closure from an extraordinary  talent.	2000-04-18

I know that Honor is now in the senior, SENIOR ranks of the military and can't be at the helm of space battles any more.  BUT...that doesn't excuse Weber from writing a boring,  technojunk- filled, overlong book.  David, are they paying you by the word?   All of the Honor Harrington books have used the literary device of  introducing characters and then following their individual stories.  Weber  has introduced soooo many characters that following them in every book  gives us character &quot;sound bites&quot; not plot lines.  Further, he  skimped on the best stuff - like Rob Pierre's death, Honor's return and how  she's going to handle her love for a married Admiral.  The emotional  upheaval dominates the first few chapters and then disappears.  Boy, those  two have first-class sublimation techniques!  Finally, if Honor's mom gets  any cuter, I give the population of Yeltsin's Star permission to shoot  her....along with half the treecats!  So there!  Let's get back to good,  old-fashioned story telling, please!  Don't buy this weighty tome in  hardbound. Wait for the paperback.	2000-03-09

Well, this is one of those times.  She delivered such a gem in A  SCENT OF MAGIC that my expectations were high for this one. But a WIND IN  THE STONE is a disjointed mishmash of a story with characters you spend too  little time with to get to know.  Skip this one, especially in hard cover,  and read the paperback if you absolutely must.	2000-02-14

I was disappointed in the promise but NOT in the book.  Lindskold's newest, &quot;Legends Walking,&quot; continues to explore  Changer's relationship with his coyote-formed daughter, his place in the  Anthenor and his growing attraction to Athena.  Most of the action concerns  the efforts of various Immortals to prevent germ warfare in Africa.    Language and concepts are broad but interesting and the African setting  gives the author the opportunity to explore a new culture and expand upon  the characters of Immortals we met only briefly in &quot;The Changer.&quot;   The sequel can be read as a single but makes better sense if  &quot;Changer&quot; is read first.  If I have a complaint, it's that Arthur  and Merlin are starting to sound whiney.  Arthur purports to be King - he  can do better than this.  <br />Legends Walking is a worthy sequel to an  interesting and novel creation.	2000-01-31

Well, Jen and Thib continue their pre-graduation assignments with a body guarding job in an environment of &quot;total&quot; corruption that reads rather tamely.  Aunt Vera and Absalom are working on the same problem from  another angle and all four assassins unite to find and eliminate the master  drug lord.  We see a lot more of Vera's past, although Absalom remains a  mystery.  Thib is growing in confidence and skills, while Jen learns a  lesson the hard way.  I would suggest to the author that she had better  improve Jen quickly, if she intends to complete the Jen/Thib relationship.   Thib is starting to recognize himself and his talents...Jen hasn't got much  more than her good looks and her reflexes going for her.  Not as good as  the last entry in this series but still an interesting read.	2000-01-03

This regency/alternate earth collaboration by Norton and Edghill, which looks to be the first of a series, is a winner!  Is it perfect? No. The last half of the book is a bit rushed and the use of magic is uneven. Even  so, I believed in the characters; their dilemmas are real and not easily  resolved.  The dialogue is appropriate to the setting and I loved Sarah  taking over the rifle and shooting down the French troops, to the amazement  of her so-reluctant husband - right before they fly away in a hot-air  balloon!  This is a merry-go-round of a book with pretensions to be a  carousel.  <br />Playing in an alternate earth is always fun: lots of name  dropping occurs as real historical figures turn up in new walks of life.   Beau Brummell finally finds his proper niche as a valet, while John Adams  still loves his wife! This book deserves a sequel - there's lots of room  for more intrigue, romance and magic in this world - or in an alternate  Carolinian earth!  I'm looking forward to our English Prince meeting his  Danish bride; Wessex and Sarah consummating their marriage (I don't believe  they got that far at the end of this book) and Wessex getting over the  &quot;honor&quot; and spying question...Let's enjoy all the benefits of a  Regency/Scarlett Pimpernel romance and alternate history scifi whirlygig  next time.	1999-11-08

Frankly, OWLKNIGHT falls a little flat.  I was looking forward to the resolution of the Darien/Keisha relationship   but the third &quot;Owl&quot; opens with them in bed together already!   Further, I felt that Keisha's insecurities were no longer real, given her  relationship with Darian, and that the self-doubts rose less out of  character development and more out of plot necessity.  Otherwise, I, for  one, was tired of the Northerners but the plot and adventurers were well  handled.  Finally, the Shandi/Steelmind combo was intriguing - but it came  out of left field!  I wondered how that would really work out - a working  Herald (not the heir) and a non-Mage Hawkbrother!  Interesting!  Mostly,  this volume tied up loose ends and explored the northern lands as WHITE  GRYPHON explored the south.  We also get hit on the head with the value of  diversity...again.  Albeit, I agree heartily with the sentiment but I'm  getting a bit bored with the preaching air.	1999-09-22

Six gory murders, five ceremonial occasions, four Moonchildren, three lovers, two religious sects at odds, and one desert planet clinging to traditional ways make for lovely way to spend a few hours.  I throughly  enjoyed WRAPT IN CRYSTAL: Sharon Shinn is improving with each book she  writes.  Who wouldn't fall for her angst-ridden detective, Cowan Drake?  Although this is better SciFi than mystery, it works well either way.  A  little more attention to plot twists and a little less attention to  simplistic religious debate would have made this a five star book.	1999-05-26

He brings his usual sophomoric prose style  and sloppy character development to this outing.  While diehard StarWars  fans should probably read this for the extra background information , I  would advise taking some of Brooks' assumptions with a grain of salt.  He  ascribes motivations and emotions to characters, particularly Obi Wan, that  are not supported by action in either the Phantom Menace or the first  trilogy.  Maybe he knows something we don't but I doubt it.  Brooks has a  habit of creating emotional conflicts for his characters than never end up  effecting the plot.  I suspect he's at it again here.	1999-05-26

While I loved FIRE ROSE, THE BLACK SWAN left me cold ( and in hard cover, no less).  It wasn't the new happy ending to the tragic tale (I never cared for tragedy anyway), but the  lack of logical character development.  Siegfried's conversion from rapist  to lover is hardly convincing and Odette's character is totally unknown for  the first 100 pages of the book. Odile, who manages the happy ending for  the other two and a considerable increase in wealth for the principality,  is left with the satisfaction of doing good, a home in the aforementioned  kingdom (the least they could do) and the possibility of a lover in the  Prince's sidekick, &quot;Benno.&quot;  (What kind of name is that for a  love interest?!)  Not satisfying at all!	1999-05-12
