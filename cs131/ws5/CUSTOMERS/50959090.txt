There are terse acknowledgements (with detailed faults appended) of the significance of the Louisiana Purchase, the founding of the University of Virginia, and etc., but a whole chapter of outrage devoted to Sally Hemings.  Hitchens makes Jefferson's failure to solve the dilemma of The Peculiar Institution the central fact of his career, if not the main theme of this book.<br /><br />So, can a fair biography of Thomas Jefferson be written by someone who still reveres the genie of Bolshevik revolution, Leon Trotsky?  Trotsky, who would certainly not have turned into a Jeffersonian democrat, had he ever gotten the whip hand in Russia?  Well, generally speaking, yes.  Jefferson gets a predictably rough ride in these pages.  His famous contradictions are not excused, and unqualified admiration is given only for his many scientific interests and his anticlericalism.  And one wonders if such charity as Hitchens does extend to Jefferson is a result of his galvanized respect for the American project in the wake of 9/11.  As many enemies as Hitchens has made over the years, though, no one serious has ever accused him of being ignorant.  Hitchens has read deeply and wide--he ticks off an impressive bibliography in his introduction--is aware of his own leanings, and his writing has the familiar learned but curdled j'accuse tone it always did.  (Plus, students picking up this small book for a homework assignment will probably need to look up words like \\"uxoriousness\\", for example.)<br /><br />Hitchens is of course a well-known cultured despiser of religion, and he is drawn to those passages in Jefferson's writings which reflect the same attitude.  But I doubt that Jefferson, for all his disdain of \\"priestcraft\\", ever had one-half the hatred of religion that Hitchens does, and Hitchens' treatment of this aspect of Jefferson's character is the only part I see verging on projection.<br /><br />Hitchens repeatedly scores Jefferson on his half-hearted approach to the slavery question.  In one bit he condemns Jefferson's apprehension of the prospect of bloody revolution in Haiti, though of course Jefferson's premonition of wholesale massacre was later proven correct.  Is this a consequence of once having been a devotee of political theories that result in mass liquefaction of \\"reactionary\\" populations, perhaps?  (Hitchens does grant him--barely--his effort to pass legislation that would have required the end of slavery by 1800.)  And Hitchens' leftist instincts are again on display in a passage about the Embargo Act.  Contrast his depiction of it as an endeavor of proto-Wilsonian idealism, as opposed to Paul Johnson in _History of the American People_ painting it as an example of proto-Wilsonian muddle-headedness.  Hitchens sardonically dismisses the harm that Americans took in their \\"pocketbooks\\" during the life of the Embargo Act, while praising the policy as a rare example of trying to conduct international conflicts peacefully.  Someone who has not been in the habit of thinking that \\"the masses\\" belong either on the barricades or knitting potholders on some proletarian commune would not be so callous towards ordinary people's livelihoods.<br /><br />Yet there are clues that Jefferson has found a place in Hitchens' heart as well as in the historian's dock.  He includes a letter from Jefferson that contains this phrase:<br /><br />\\"...cut off from my family & friends, my affairs abandoned to chaos & derangement, in short giving everything I love, in exchange for everything I hate...\\"<br /><br />Hitchens obviously had this phrase in mind in an interview he gave about his reaction to 9/11:<br /><br />\\"Here we are then, I was thinking, in a war to the finish between everything I love and everything I hate. Fine. We will win and they will lose.\\"<br /><br />I learned a few new things from this biography, and looked at some old things in new ways.  Its admirable concision and clear points deliver the goods.  It's only to be expected that, given any pundit's lack of transparency, this book will contain almost as much of the author as of the subject.  Since any assertion about Jefferson brings other scholars leaping into print with their rebuttals, this should not be taken by the reader as the last word on Thomas Jefferson.  There's little danger of that anyway: given the avalanche of learned tomes about our third President and his prodigiously seminal ideas, there may never be a last word.Its admirable concision and clear points deliver the goods.

A History of the Scriptures Through the Ages	Books	3	32	38	N	N	A reflection as much as a history	Professor Pelikan has been around forever and is fearsomely learned.  That said, this is not so much a popularized history of the Bible (readers wanting one of those can find serviceable titles from Dorling Kindersley or other publishers like that), as it is his ruminations on its development through ages.  It borders on being turgid here and there; a fair use excerpt shows his somewhat prolix style:<br /><br />\\"The presence in the Bible of attitudes toward nature and the universe that are, in our judgment, \\"prescientific\\" is[...]not simply a nutshell that can be discarded to find the eternal kernel inside. [...T]hese attitudes are bound up with its fundamental message. Nevertheless, when seen in the light of the history of biblical commentary and interpretation, whether Jewish or Christian, this \\"prescientific\\" picture of the universe is in fact one that it has been possible for widely divergent \\"scientific\\" pictures, as they have succeeded one another through the ages, to accommodate.  It is a fair generalization that there is no scientific or philosophical cosmology with which the biblical message has been unable to come to terms at least in some measure, and at the same time none with which it has been entirely comfortable.  What is more, the accommodation of the biblical message to this or that cosmology has often reached its completion at just about the same time that the cosmology was yielding to its successor.  It is impossible to make up an alternate formulation, using the vocabulary of any scientific or philosophical worldview ancient or modern, that could have the eternal staying power of the sublime opening words of the Book of Genesis, \\"In the beginning<br />God created heaven and earth.\\"  The very irrelevance of Biblical cosmology has made it relevant over and over.\\"<br /><br />And this passage is really just an aside.  But he also drops in a witticism occasionally, too.  For example:<br /><br />\\"To invoke a Kierkegaardesque figure of speech, the beauty of the language of the Bible can be like a set of dentist's instruments neatly laid out on a table and hanging on a wall, intriguing in their technological complexity and with their stainless steel highly polished--until they set to work on the job for which they were originally designed.  Then all of a sudden my reaction changes from \\"How shiny and beautiful they all are!\\" to \\"Get that damned thing out of my mouth!\\"<br /><br />One of the main themes of the book, announced in the opening pages, is the role of the Bible as the Word of God.  Prof. Pelikan takes a mostly Catholic stance, pointing out that the Bible has been through many revisions and was once a body of oral tradition.  Hence his opening sally about the Bible being as much the spoken Word as the written.  He also rejects, or rather asserts the general rejection of, the primacy of individual conscience in the interpretation of the Bible, instead insisting on the communitarian nature of the Body of Christ and the Nation of Israel, for whom the Scriptures were given.  Although this is not a book of polemics, he does fault the Protestants of the Reformation for prizing the Bible over the Catholic church and tradition, since it was the church and tradition that had compiled and preserved the Bible.  True enough, but of course Protestantism's beef with the papacy was its corruption and failure to uphold the Bible.  Hence, the Catholic Reformation.<br /><br />So despite the density of detail, this feels like a personal book.  Its scope and abundance of marginalia reminded me of Jacques Barzun's From Dawn To Decadence, in that it felt a bit like a final debriefing, or a farewell.  Both scholars are closing in on the end of their careers, and both books are stuffed to bursting with detail (Barzun's more so, though), as if the authors were thoroughly debriefing themselves, getting it all out there for the public.  Whose Bible Is It won't do for a general audience primer, but it is a window on one superb scholar's lifetime of study of Holy Scripture.	2005-09-25

A number of intriguing books came out in the 1990s, giving the reader a peek inside the Kremlin and the gulag from back in the first half or so of the Soviet era.  Now these are drying up as the FSB, the successor to the KGB, slams the door on any more investigation into the totalitarian past.<br /><br />Author David E. Murphy clearly resents it.  This book, compiled mainly from a couple of Russian collections of archival documents released in the 1990s, amasses an amazing amount of detail about the run-up to Operation Barbarossa.  Yet for all that, the information is chiefly drawn from the Soviet military intelligence services, as access to the prewar archives of the Soviet security services proved to be impossible.<br /><br />It doesn't really matter to the general reader, though.  The book confirms in overwhelming detail what was long known in general: Stalin ignored and frequently punished warnings of the impending German attack on the Soviet Union.  The blow was so telegraphed, on the way for so long, that the reader can only shudder at both Stalin's blindness, and his underlings' abject fear of him.  The book shows Stalin's obstinacy in considerably more minute detail than we've seen before, but it is still the same Stalin: paranoid, out of his depth in military matters, calculating, and bloody-minded.  There are doubtless unpleasant surprises moldering away in the NKVD archives, but surely nothing to overturn the picture we now have.<br /><br />The historical recovery Murphy accomplishes is impressive enough, though.  The most notable example is the interwoven biography of aviator Soviet Military Intelligence chief Ivan Iosevich Proskurov.  This no-nonsense, outspoken professional stood out like a tarantula on a piece of angel food cake, so far as Stalin was concerned.  His candid warnings about Soviet military deficiencies were no more welcome than anyone else's.  Stalin pinned the blame of the Finnish war on him and had him shot.  His tale, interwoven through the documentary evidence assembled here, is a sad encapsulation of the terror of High Stalinism, and the godawful ruination of lives that was its fruit.bout Soviet military deficiencies were no more welcome than anyone else's.

What brave fellows I must this day lose!"	1776 is a thrilling and educational read, especially if like me you are hazy on the exact sequence of events of that year.  McCullough sticks to military events, keeping the focus on George Washington in the field rather than on the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.  McCullough's Washington is indecisive and unsure of himself at first, and nearly given to despair at the frequent disasters hammering his little army.  But he is always self-possessed and well turned out in public, as inspiring to the reader as he was to his men.<br /><br />It's astounding how many chances the British had to end the rebellion.  But time after time, whenever the opportunity yawned, so did General Howe.  It also gives pause how often the Americans' slender hopes were preserved by sheerest chance: fortuitous fogs, unfavorable winds for the British fleet, the capture of Washington's worst critic General Lee, etc.  McCullough handles the suspense very well, especially in the scenes of the American evacuation of Long Island.<br /><br />McCullough tells his tale with extensive quotations from original sources.  These are especially effective because of his frequent insertion of a phrase from the source into his own exposition.  For example, \\"Still there was no snow.  Instead, a 'cruel thaw' set in, halting progress for several days.\\"  In such ways McCullough gives the reader a window on the Eighteenth Century, while maintaining contemporary standards of readability.<br /><br />This book is so good that I confess I blinked back tears at some points, such as Washington helplessly watching General Stirling's Marylanders, trapped and outnumbered, attacking General Cornwallis' full regiment of British regulars.  As Washington watched the Marylanders form up and get cut down again and again, he was heard to exclaim, \\"Good God!  What brave fellows I must this day lose!\\"<br /><br />Fifteen years ago or so, who could have predicted the current boom in popular works on the American Founding?  But here it is, still going strong, and for this the greatest thanks must go to David McCullough.  The Revolutionary War period has innumerable great stories in it, and whatever else damage political correctness has done during its ascendancy in university history departments, it has not killed off people's enthusiasm for great stories.  McCullough and his many imitators have been generous suppliers.and for this the greatest thanks must go to David McCullough.

Terrorism of course hovers over these pages, but the tone is hopeful, even upbeat.<br /><br />Things have been happening so fast these past several years, it hardly seems credible that it is now time to take historical stock of events like the IPO of Netscape, or of the wireless revolution.  But these have indeed visibly shaped our world, and are still doing so.  In back of all the \\"flatteners\\", he says, is the biggest flattener of all: the universal and immediate availability of information.<br /><br />Any number of big trends could have been included here, of course, but I still thought it a bit odd that he dealt very little with the liberalization of banking over the past twenty years.  The advent of interstate banking, with the cornucopia of financial products that are now available to most people, may well be a function of the other trends in communication Friedman explores.  But micro-capitalism and micro-banking in India has been instrumental, along with the outsourced programming and call centers that Friedman treats, in raising that country's masses into an approximation of a middle class.<br /><br />Also, some of the innovations are not quite as hot as their hype, yet.  Friedman enthuses over wiki technology, made famous in the Wikipedia.  \\"How...does one produce a credible, balanced encyclopedia by way of an ad hoc open-source, open-editing movement?\\"  Answer: frequently, you don't.  Many of the articles are consensus monsters or permanent flame wars, preventing the whole enterprise from rising to the quality of a good edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica.<br /><br />As for the prospects for the future, Friedman voices some common fears, but is overall optimistic.  So long as the \\"flatteners\\" are in play, then the sky's still the limit for skilled workers who keep their skills up and their eyes open to emerging opportunities.  Wages for these workers will achieve worldwide parity by having wages go up overseas, rather than be depressed in the U. S., eventually.  He does admit that things will be rough for unskilled workers, though.  They will have to move up in order to thrive, no small order.  Indeed, the loss of high-wage manufacturing jobs in the U.S. may lead to some bad trends of its own.<br /><br />In all, this book is an informative and enjoyable _tour d'horizon_ of these early years of the High Information Age.

Here is an in-depth survey of the Allied bombing campaign over Europe in World War II.  It's still striking to read of all the turf wars, infighting, doctrinal differences, stubbornness, and all-around friction that were behind this massive effort.<br /><br />Throughout, there are plenty of technical details concerning the aircraft.  The stories of the P-51D Mustang, the Norden bombsight, and the B-17 Flying Fortress will all be familiar to military buffs, but are still intriguing nonetheless.<br /><br />This was the high-tide of the doctrine of Air Power, and with hindsight it seems that air marshals overestimated the power of longe-range bombers to affect the War.  The skill and bravery of the men behind missions like the Ploesti raid are beyond praise, but their tangible effects turned out not to be decisive.  In fact, when strategic bombers were used in tactictal operations in France, to help the bottled-up armies break out of their salients, one might argue that this use was more productive.  But, of course, there was no way to know any of this beforehand.<br /><br />The author wraps up with Dresden and its moral repercussions, and also with the revisionist reevaluation of the bomber war.  His point in brief is that everyone thought it necessary to hit the Germans as hard as possible with everything to hand, and that we've got the whole rest of history in which to second-guess those decisions.  In one personal note, he notes that the Germans destroyed the City of London so thoroughly that he, the author, practiced wargames in its ruins as a Royal Marine in 1952.  One comes away with a renewed appreciation for the brave aircrews, and for the knotty task of Bomber Command and the USAAF, who had no 100% good way to fight the Good War.	2005-08-14

The stars of the tale are old books, ethnic cuisine, and the European landscape.  Elizabeth Kostova has taken the well-worn theme of vampirism and produced a work of power and beauty.<br /><br />The interwoven narratives are well done, almost like Russian nesting dolls in some sections.  This gives us a palpable sense of unraveling old mysteries.<br /><br />Kostova wisely keeps the monsters offstage for most of the book, only giving us glimpses of them in the wings of the narrative.  An out-of-place bat, a stranger glaring from across a crowd, shapes in the clouds, that sort of thing.  And wisely so, because so many horror tales jump the shark once the creature joins the tale.  But in this book, the head fiend retains his menace onscreen, right through the very last page.<br /><br />Foreshadowing is well done, and Kostova's use of allusion and implication is superb.  In one secret archive a character discovers a list of Russian and Polish names with Stalin's name on it-a smoking gun from the Katyn massacre?  And in another development the heartache caused by a case of amnesia might allude to Milan Kundera's anti-communist meditation The Book of Laughter and Forgetting.<br /><br />There are more tingles than chills, and more anguish than terror.  This last characteristic serves as a subtle bit of parallelism with Europe's real life despotism:  The European horrors of the 20th century brought untold suffering to countless sundered, ruined families.  The young female protagonist suddenly feels the reality of historical evil, in one such passage.<br /><br />The only part of the novel that the author seems to flub, IMO, is when one pivotal character is brought onstage via an extremely implausible coincidence.  Kostova seems to have known it, since she has this character give a longer-than-necessary speech intended to deflect our incredulity.  He turns out to be one of the most appealing characters, so it's okay.<br /><br />This is supposed to be literary fiction, and the writing is indeed quite good.  Some fair use excerpts:<br /><br />*********<br /><br />\\"As an adult, I have often known that peculiar legacy time brings to the traveler; the longing to seek out a place a second time, to find deliberately what we stumbled on once before, to recapture the feeling of discovery.  Sometimes we search out again even a place that was not remarkable in itself--we look for it simply because we remember it.  If we do find it, of course, everything is different. The rough-hewn door is still there, but it's much smaller; the day is cloudy instead of brilliant; it's spring instead of autumn; we're alone instead of with three friends.  Or, worse, with three friends instead of alone.\\"<br /><br />\\"This time I felt my own face redden.  Talking with this woman was like sitting still for a series of slaps, delivered arhythmically so you couldn't know when the next one was coming.\\"<br /><br />\\"I saw on the older woman's face the gleam of a single tear.  I've read there is no such thing as a single tear, that old poetic trope.  And perhaps there isn't, since hers was simply companion to my own.\\"<br /><br />***********<br /><br />Comparisons with the work of Anne Rice are inevitable, but not very apposite, IMO.  The book that The Historian reminded me of most, if comparisons must be made, is Madison Smartt Bell's All Souls' Rising.  There is no specific similarity between them, but Bell's book deploys equally rich historical detail to imply parallels with the modern world, though not so overtly as Kostova.<br /><br />As you might can tell by this time, The Historian is far more than a tale about an antique bloodsucker.  It won't give away too much to say that this is a book about bibliophiles for bibliophiles, and that the evil fate awaiting the heroes is the danger of spending eternity as Dracula's graduate assistant.  Some loose ends are pointedly left in view, all the better to start knitting a sequel, probably.  If Kostova can avoid the sophomore slump, it will be more than worth the wait.is the danger of spending eternity as Dracula's graduate assistant.

At this late date many of the stories are told by the children or grandchildren of the people involved, so the preservation of these tales is all the more a service.<br /><br />The dilemma faced by the French wine industry under the Nazi occupation was stark: How to avoid ruin, either from expropriation or execution.  The Vichy government saved the Jewish Rothschild maison by making it a state property.  Others banded together and tried to keep the Germans mollified as best they could.  They frequently sent inferior grades of wine to the Wehrmacht, but at least one house was always careful to send their best when the German High Command, who knew their wines, sent in an order.  And one interesting fact is that the Germans orders of wine served as an intelligence tool: The Wehrmacht's preparation for action could be judged by how much hooch they were stocking up.<br /><br />The French vintners proved themselves to be masters of concealment and deception.  Wine cellars, barns, and such hid their best products, as well as the maquis.  There are a few amusing incidents where the discrete cells of the French Resistance crossed trails.  In one, a shipment of high-quality wine is hijacked on its way to Germany.  The Resistance fighters celebrate with a tipple from the liberated wine, but discover that the casks have been filled with low-grade junk.<br /><br />At the end, there are a couple of examples of reconciliation.  The German \\"weinfuhrers\\", who were in charge of supplying the Reich with French wine, went on trial after the war.  In one trial, a French wine official, who was also a Resistance member, sticks up for his German counterpart, blaming the Gestapo for the crimes he is charged with, and helps get him acquitted.  Another former Nazi humbly writes to the head of a prominent maison, asking to represent his product in Germany. So the story, like a good wine, ends in a shimmer of bonhomie and good cheer, as much as any story could at the end of such a war.the story, like a good wine, ends in a shimmer of bonhomie and good cheer, as much as any story could at the end of such a war.	2005-07-17

Fenton's plaint is well-taken: Americans need to be better informed.  But, as humorist Dave Barry once noted, try to get them to read a four-part newspaper series on bauxite mining, and they'll flip to the sports pages.  What to do?  As the cliche has it, there are No Easy Answers here.<br /><br />Fenton blames the news media's corporate ownership for the decline of the news.  Maybe.  But it was a CBS marketing exec, not anybody in the news department, who first sounded the internal klaxon on the fake Air National Guard memos.  The newsies wanted so badly for them to be true, they couldn't be bothered to properly verify them.<br /><br />What's truly remarkable is the mention made of liberal media bias, and the advent of bloggers.  These are noted in passing, and are basically \\"of-course\\"d aside, but it's still startling to see a major media figure even acknowledge their existence.  Maybe the MSM is coming out of denial on this score. I guess they'd have to, sooner or later.  You can't be a gatekeeper when the walls are down.<br /><br />Throughout, Fenton casts the Bush Presidency as a calamitous consequence of the failures of the news media.  Sorry, not buyin'.  This is merely a retread of the liberal notion that the American public are too stupid to vote in their own best interests, unless liberals tell them what those interests are.  As for Bush being culpable for 9/11, as he insinuates at one point, the reader is galled anew at the cheek of liberals, who hold their guy Clinton blameless for his eight years of dithering, yet point fingers at the Bush team for not sorting out the muddle in eight months.<br /><br />Fenton's conclusions are pessimistic: TV news needs to be expanded, and fortified, but how can extended news programs draw a viewership?  The public probably isn't up to it, is the glum conclusion.  Fenton is right that if internet gossip replaces hard news, then the citizenry will suffer.  But the success of substantial major blogs, which have caught out major media outlets in errors, distortions, and downright fabrications these past few years, bodes well for the public's appetite and capacity for hard, informed news.  If TV can't deliver it anymore, then that's hardly the public's fault.distortions, and downright fabrications these past few years, bodes well for the public's appetite and capacity for hard, informed news.

(The author spells the city thus, rather than the official Mumbai.)  The focus is on the religious minority the Parsis, who honor the ancient prophet Zoroaster or Zarathustra.  Zoroaster was from somewhere in eastern Iran, as best as anyone can tell, and the Parsis in this book indeed look more Persian than they do like their Aryan/Dravidian compatriots, to this admittedly untrained eye.  The author approvingly includes a neat quote by Friedrich Nietzsche in the introduction:<br /><br />\\"People have never asked me, as they should have done, what the name Zarathustra precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first Immoralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all others in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an immoralist.

The familiar urban India of crumbling concrete, colorful shutters, thronging streets, and hole in the wall shops is vividly reproduced here.  It is oddly refreshing to not have India's poverty on display--we know it exists, but that's not the point of this book.  The people herein range from the wealthy to the shopkeeper class.  It is not, as similar books by non-Indians are prone to be, a cavalcade of exotica.<br /><br />Some of the uniformly excellent photos include these:<br /><br />A deaf, wizened grandfather shouting at a fountain pen repairman.<br /><br />An abandoned, one-room temple, still with its devotional portraits and wall clock, inhabited only by a crow on the ceiling fan.<br /><br />Middle-aged businessmen, most half in the bag already, crowding the bar at a celebration<br /><br />Young priests performing a rite over a ceremonial feast, on the floor in a daylight interior space.<br /><br />A wealthy art patron and wife, in their sumptuous living room.<br /><br />Several river scenes, with devotional activity such as reciting verses or praying in the water.<br /><br />A Parsi and a Nepalese seated together on the train--a contrast of ethnic types.<br /><br />A man with a distinctive face, such as Leonardo da Vinci collected in his sketchbooks, snapped with the telephoto lens while waiting for the bus.<br /><br />And plenty of home scenes, like one of mother, friend, and tots, enjoying a play date on the English-looking lawn.

Thanks to Clinton's astounding political skill and his lack of principles, he was able to outmaneuver the flat-footed GOP, pass much of their platform with him taking the credit, and easily win re-election in '96.  Gingrich was ousted, Clinton's impeachment scattered the chesspieces, and that seemed to be the end of it.  But a scant eight years later, John Kerry and the other Dems were forced to pay lip service to the goals of the CWA, in order to stay competitive.<br /><br />Author Major Garrett avoids most polemics, instead concentrating on the political wrangling that went into reconfiguring the Republican Party post-Reagan, and the crafting of the CWA.  One rather funny scene has a key backer being called to his office door late at night, still in pajamas, to sign off on a compromise draft.<br /><br />Again, the thorough reconstruction of the events of this time are the book's real value, and as such it can be read with profit by Americans of all political persuasions.	2005-05-15

A quick take on the passing parade is normally gone as soon as said parade is.  This collection of Robertson Davies' bread and butter writing newspaper writing is anything but stale.<br /><br />Davies' old Sunday columns from various Canadian newspapers date back nearly half a century from the time of this book's publication.  As he limits himself mostly to great literature and writers, the pieces have aged well.  Davies comes across as a rather avuncular feuilleton, serving up tidy little takes on Dickens, James Agate, the Welsh verse form known as the englyn, and a slew of other famous and once-famous figures.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand: this is not the most timeless stuff Davies ever wrote.  But it is a good collection of his marginalia, which has the rare virtue of never being trivial.	2005-05-15

However, he says that our past years of dithering will cause the current crunch to bite even harder in the immediate future.  More and more demand on less and less oil will cause much wailing and gnashing of teeth before a solution emerges.<br /><br />The meat of the book is a series of very informative rundowns of the particulars, history, and status of the various alternative technologies.  Wind, shale, liquefied natural gas and etc. are all explained and their prospects examined.  He alludes to the famous wager between Julian Simon and Paul Ehrlich when he says than sure, there's plenty of zinc and lead, if that's what you want.  But energy sources are another matter.<br /><br />And he's quite witty.  He remarks that one particular chemical method of shale oil production would probably spawn any number of lawsuits.  \\"The torts might be more profitable than the retorts.\\"<br /><br />It's rather sobering for someone who came up in the Jet Age to consider that cheap, abundant energy may soon be no more.  It gives even more pause to think, as Deffeyes reminds us, that the age of the gas internal combustion engine is scarcely two human lifetimes old.  We've come so far, it seems like forever.<br /><br />And not to put a cap on human ingenuity, but what possible substitute could there be for something like aviation fuel?  You can't fly at Mach 1.8 on solar cells.  We're facing some major changes in the coming decades, and Prof. Deffeyes book is a most welcome roadmap.	2005-05-13

These pieces, originally written for the amusement of his colleagues from the early 60s to the late 70s, work just fine as cozies for an educated general audience.  The stories are literate, if somewhat samey, and very droll, in that understated Canadian way reminiscent of Stephen Leacock.  It would indeed be great to have an audiotape of this, as many of the passages beg to be read aloud.  Some fair use excerpts:<br /><br />\\"Women always think that if they tell a man not to be pompous that will shut him up, but I am an old hand at that game.  I know that if a man bides his time his moment will come.\\"<br /><br />\\"I am a democrat.  All of my family have been persons of peasant origin, who have wrung a meagre sufficiency from a harsh world by the labour of their hands.  I acknowledge no one my superior merely on grounds of a more fortunate destiny, a favoured birth.  I did what any such man would do when confronted with Queen Victoria; I fell immediately to my knees.\\"<br /><br />\\"The devil gave me a look which made me profoundly uneasy.  'Just because I am enjoying your sympathy, don't imagine that I cannot read you like a book,' he said.  'You think you are cleverer than I; it is a very common academic delusion.'\\"<br /><br />I'm unfamiliar with Davies' \\"serious\\" works, but any major writer who isn't afraid to show his readers a good time is all right with me.	2005-04-05

Super-church pastor Rick Warren has certainly hit a commercial homerun with this book, as the sales rocket and the tie-ins like videos, journals, and etc. come to market.  It is a pastiche of self-help bullet points, penny wisdom, and paraphrased scripture.  Anecdotes are kept to a minimum, in favor of developing the theme of each purpose.  It isn't the most profound call to action ever written, but it does make its exhortations clearly and passionately, and obviously people are responding.  It was even instrumental in getting a murder suspect to surrender in Atlanta recently, when the woman he had taken hostage read him excerpts.<br /><br />The penny wisdom he comes up with is pithy and easy to remember.  Such as, \\"Whenever you see the word 'therefore' in the Bible, you have to find out what it's there for.\\" \\"'Work in' is what God does for you, 'work out' is what you do for yourself.\\" \\"We evangelize non-believers, and minister to our fellow believers.\\"  And best of all, \\"You'll never know that God is all you need until God is all you've got.\\"<br /><br />The scripture citations are heavily paraphrased, but for the goal Pastor Warren sets for himself in this book that is not a big problem.  Anyone so inspired can go read the real passages and dig deeper.<br /><br />I had to smile at one point, when Pastor Warren showed his California background.  He was warning against the danger of putting anything in your life before God.  When you do that, you're in danger of...what?  Eternal punishment?  Estrangement from God?  No, you're in danger of *stress*.  How terrible for a Golden State denizen!<br /><br />So, what's the verdict?  I'm the type that naturally views mass evangelism with a superior, ironic eye.  Yet even I signed up for some new activities in my church at the conclusion of the \\"40 Days of Purpose\\" program.  Believers more committed than I will surely be moved to greater works of faith.  Warren's the pastor of the moment, and he succeeds in passing along the \\"old, old story\\" in an inspiring way.Warren's the pastor of the moment, and he succeeds in passing along the \\"old, old story\\" in an inspiring way.	2005-03-17
US	50959090	RSJ3UB5OSYJA7	1594200335	844238166	The United States of Europe: The New Superpower and the End of American Supremacy	Books	3	14	24	N	N	A Peek Inside The Velvet Kennel	This is a detailed look at a little-considered development: the rise of a unified Europe.<br /><br />Most Americans are unaware of the economic colossus now beginning to flex its muscles, so Reid's book is a much-needed introduction.  He provides informative historical background, putting faces to the faceless Eurocrats.  We learn how European regulators are bending world markets to their standards, how the euro is becoming a financial counterweight to the dollar, and how European entrepreneurs are acquiring a brash, can-do confidence formerly associated solely with American business.  The half-century old dream of \\"Europe, whole and free,\\" has come to pass, and the Old Country is looking to take its place in the sun.  The book succeeds in painting a portrait of a family of nations on the move, a portrait Americans need to be informed of.  Reid is not a complete booster, as he includes several accounts of him taking up for America on European panels and talk shows.  Nor does he depict each and every European way of doing things as superior.  But he is clearly impressed, favorably, with the overall developments in modern Europe.<br /><br />Readers bothered by liberal bias will find plenty to filter out.  T. R. Reid is a stereotypical big-media/NPR-inside-the-beltway-liberal.  He shares a nudge-wink chuckle with his like-minded readers over Europeans skeptical of the EU, likening them to Red State American voters who need not be taken seriously by intelligent folks.  He hews to the standard liberal misrepresentations of the Bush administration's war of terror.  Gleefully ironic use of \\"the almighty dollar\\" occurs on every tenth page or so.  And so on.<br /><br />An open-minded reader can mentally correct for all that, but there are some instances where the bias topples over into disingenuousness.  In the section on the stillborn merger between G.E. and Honeywell, the EU regulators who killed it are represented as merely being more attentive to anti-trust concerns than their American counterparts.  Baloney!  The name \\"Airbus\\" screams from between the lines of this episode.  Reid does acknowledge, later in the book, that the Europeans have heavily subsidized Airbus in order to undercut American competitors, but also faults Boeing for its plump military contracts-a case of comparing apples and oranges, since Airbus came to the military market only in 1999.<br /><br />Another glaring omission is the lack of any substantial treatment of immigration to Europe.  Canadian pundit Mark Steyn said that \\"The design flaw of the radical secular welfare state is that it depends on a traditionally religious society birthrate to sustain it.\\"  Christianity in its institutional form has largely evaporated in Europe, and European birthrates are below replacement levels--what will fill the vacuum?  Labor is now coming from the Middle East, and their higher birthrate is causing the now-familiar demographic shift.  One prominent weblog even has a poll on which European country will be the first to impose Islamic Shariah law.  What's sad is that many of the original immigrants came to Europe to get away from the Islamocrazies. But as their children grow up in welfare state comfort, studying in Wahabhist-funded mosques, many of the kids respond to the call of Jihad in their new homes.  And the Europeans are intimidated by them.  Witness the cancelled screenings of films by the late Theo Van Gogh, murdered in the street by a jihadi, in order to avoid further provoking the Islamofascists.  But Reid nowhere deals with this open secret--liberal orthodoxy forbids it, apparently.<br /><br />Lastly, some of the conclusions of the book have been refuted by current events, some of which Reid ought to have acknowledged.  Not Europe, but Bush, ponied up $15 billion for AIDS relief for Africa.  Peacekeeping missions?  One wag said that peacekeeping was the means by which a war could be dragged out to its longest possible duration.  So what if the Europeans send their troops in larger numbers on these missions?  \\"Per capita\\" generosity in foreign aid?  It doesn't take any generosity to donate someone else's money, as is done by government charity via tax revenues.  Especially when the local dictator will ship the money right back into European banks for safekeeping (upon which point Reid is embarrassingly naïve).  Working for peace?  The United States military has done more for peace, and more to liberate enslaved populations, since 9/11 than Europe's \\"engagement\\" with the dictators of its former colonies ever did, or ever could.  Indeed, in early 2005, the contrast couldn't be starker:  Europe collaborates with and profits from Middle Eastern despotism; America confronts and conquers it.  Europe sucks the blood of the oppressed; America frees them.  If I were a European, it'd take more than four weeks of guaranteed annual vacation to ease my mind about that.s send their troops in larger numbers on these missions?  \\"Per capita\\" generosity in foreign aid?

The Anglo-Saxon chronicle has an account of a navy assembled by Ethelred the Unready to fight the Vikings.  But several of the ships were commandeered by rogue captains and used to plunder the east English coast, and later the fleet was abandoned altogether, much to the chronicler's disgust.  But this was before there was properly a Britain at all, so maybe that's why he didn't include it.<br /><br />Though he of necessity hits only the highlights of the Royal Navy's glorious history, each section is satisfyingly thrilling and illuminating.  The recreated battles scenes, such as Trafalgar and Jutland are especially well done.  Little surprises abound.  At Trafalgar, Nelson's famous signal, \\"England expects every man will do his duty\\" was met with puzzlement and exasperation. \\"I wish Nelson would stop signaling,\\" groused one captain. \\"We know well enough what to do.\\"<br /><br />By the beginning of the 20th century, the Navy's reputation was legend.  Here's a fair-use excerpt, showing the Germans' reaction at Jutland as the British fleet turned into a battle line formation:<br /><br />\\"But as Scheer gazed out at the flashing fire along the horizon, he saw something else. he saw before him the entire history of the British navy, a fighting force with an unequaled reputation for invicibility in battle and bravery under fire. \\"The English fleet,\\" he wrote later, \\"had the advantage of looking back on a hundred years of proud tradition which must have given every man a sense of superiority based on the great deeds of the past.\\" His own navy's fighting tradition was less than two years old. At that fateful moment, Scheer was confronting not John Jellicoe but the ghosts of Nelson, Howe, Rodney, Drake, and the rest; and he backed down.\\"<br /><br />The Royal Navy's performance in the Falklands war earns respect, especially for the Navy official that insisted the fleet be deployed in the first place.  But the action was not glorious, as the British ships, victims of decades of corner-cutting construction, were battered by the quickly-infamous Exocet anti-ship missiles.  Indeed, had the Argentinian junta waited a few years longer, the British aircraft carriers would have been scrapped, and the Navy would have been unable to attempt the mission at all.<br /><br />The years from WWII to the Falklands are passed over as a dark age of neglect, retreat, and decay.  Yet even in these years the Navy introduced innovations, such as the steam catapult for aircraft carriers, which were adopted by other navies.<br /><br />The most educational parts of the book are the bits describing the Navy's influence on world affairs.  Its role in creating and uniting Britain's empire, and creating the anglophone world is obvious enough.  And its suppression of the slave trade is arguably the single greatest use of military force for good in peacetime in the 19th century. But I had never considered the idea that Herman advances, that fall of the Argentinian junta after the Falklands war gave hope to democrats elsewhere in Latin America, and hastened its democratization in the following decades.<br /><br />Of course the Royal Navy was not invincible.  Its defeat in 1781 by the French helped secure American independence.  But in Britain's times of direst danger, it has always been equal to the moment.  _To Rule The Waves_ is a great telling of its story.ds war earns respect, especially for the Navy official that insisted the fleet be deployed in the first place.

This admirable quality has resulted in quite a lot of enjoyable reading, as he's educated himself on distant places, science, etymology and such, and produced books about them.<br /><br />This one, sadly, is disappointing.  It is a rote run-through of American history, of the \\"cherished myths debunked\\" school of history writing from the Sixties. He's read his Howard Zinn, and it shows.  This dated approach is too, well, too dated to give the expected pleasure to this new Bryson fan.<br /><br />Politics intrudes most in the final chapters.  For instance, the pages on the Cold War could have been used to introduce a lot of useful terms, such as \\"peacenik\\", \\"peace offensive\\", and \\"red diaper baby.\\"  But the liberal Bryson instead renders the contest with Communism as an idiotic greedfest for big business, and dwells on military double-speak from the Vietnam war.  More oddly, he defends the early 1990s wave of political correctness, and its assault on the language he professes to love.  Tepid, euphemism-ridden, colorless, and self-pitying pc-speak was never an invention of humorists, as he claims at one point, though it was satirized in a couple of books he claims are the source of the outrage.

But I understand \\"_Comment?_\\"  How, Mr. Ken?  How did you people let it happen? The UN was here when the massacres started, twenty-five hundred troops.  UN Headquarters in New York knew it was being planned, they had files and faxes and informants and they sat in their offices, consulted each other, and ate long lunches.<br /><br />\\"Most UN forces ran to the airport, they couldn't get out fast enough.  This is not a case in which the UN failed to send troops to stop genocide.  An armed, predeployed UN force evacuated as soon as it started.  All those signatures on the genocide Convention, dozens of rapturously celebrated human rights treaties, a mountain of documents at UNHQ on the subject of genocide, law professors all over the world making a living talking about this, and we _evacuated_.

His arrogance and pig-headedness still rankle with former colleagues.  Millions still wince at the recollection of the sound of his voice.  Yet, his generous support of the housing charity Habitat for Humanity helped launch that worthy enterprise to worldwide prominence.<br /><br />I refer, of course, to the late sports commentator Howard Cosell.  Years ago, when I was involved with HFH, I saw greetings cards from Cosell and his wife in the offices, and was told that he was a generous donor.<br /><br />And then there's Jimmy Carter...<br /><br />When Yugoslav dictator Josip Broz Tito died, Carter declined to attend the funeral, instead sending vice-President Mondale and an official mourning party of mid-level functionaries.  This is the last and perhaps only time Carter ever snubbed a left-wing dictator.  Ever since he's been all smiles for the likes of Daniel Ortega, Kim Il-sung, Fidel Castro, and all elbows for American policy-makers trying to deal with these tyrants.  Hayward does include the all-too-few counter-examples, when the dictators' machinations were too awful for even Carter to countenance.<br /><br />This book is compiled from opinion journal articles, mostly National Review and The New Republic, and Douglas Brinkley's book The Unfinished Presidency_.  His work with HFH and tropical disease eradication is lauded, but very briefly; and I must admit that Carter's post-Presidential meddling may cause more misery than those two efforts have alleviated, when all is said and done.  The picture selection is troubling: what's the point of showing photos of Carter falling down while jogging?<br /><br />Carter's ex-presidency is confined to the last fifth of the book, giving the lie somewhat to the book's premise.  It's good, though, to have the disasters of his administration presented anew from time to time, as the Seventies slip down the memory hole.  But as this book argues, Carter's post-presidential maneuvering may turn out to have been more harmful than anything he did as President.  If Jimmy Carter's idea of human rights boils down to kissing up to leftist dictators and stabbing the sitting President in the back, his much-vaunted moral compass is seriously askew.

First, let's have a big groan for Viking's uninformed jacket copy editor, who in the photo credits calls the gorgonopsian on the front cover a \\"dinosaur.\\"  I trust they'll fix that for the paperback edition.<br /><br />I enjoyed and reviewed Dr. Ward's book _Rare Earth_, so I know he is capable of producing rewarding science writing for the educated layman.  But as I progressed through this book, I was a bit disappointed to realize that it was mostly about himself.  His is an interesting story, but the actual science content of the book could be told in the space of an article in Discover magazine.<br /><br />The writing is gratingly overwrought much of the time, and the intensely personal nature of some of it is discomfiting.  He keeps going on about the taciturnity of his South African colleague Roger Smith, apparently not thinking that it might be a reaction to Ward's stereotypically American puppy-dog gregariousness.  The purplish prose works effectively in the first few scenes of field work in the Karoo, though; when the extreme conditions call for descriptive passages to match.<br /><br />As he and the reader slog on, the scientific data slowly accumulate.  The crew is bedeviled by human error and bad luck, on top of the hostile conditions.  For instance, after one grueling expedition is finally wrapped up, the rock samples are ruined in a lab accident, necessitating a return trip to the South African wilderness.  But eventually enough dots are connected for Ward to venture a hypothesis about the nature of the Permian/Triassic extinction, and about mass extinctions in general.<br /><br />So, does his evidence add up?  You can skip most of the book and just read the last chapter, and judge for yourself.  Or you can read the whole thing, and get an idea of the travails of field paleontology, a much more detailed idea than you ever might have wanted.	2004-11-15

These pieces unsettled me.  Here was this man publicly flaying himself, month after month, for this or that spiritual shortcoming.  He was violently emotional--made Leo Buscaglia look like the Sphinx, sometimes--to the point of exhibitionism.  He lamented his failings of discipleship, seized upon straws of insight, strove against his own flesh so passionately, that I was tempted several times to write him a letter asking him to ungrip, already.<br /><br />Years passed, and I encountered this book.  I see Mike is still calling himself a mess.  I guess there's no need to doubt him.  But now he is celebrating his acceptance in Christ, trying to draw a measure of peace from that and possibly the exhaustion that middle age brings to efforts at self-improvement.<br /><br />The book itself is a farrago of anecdotes and excerpts from other books.  Truth be told, if you don't feel yourself to be *quite* as wretched or resigned to backsliding as Mike, the book doesn't really offer a lot. But Mike is more valuable--has always been more valuable--for his example of striving and honesty in failure than for his actual preaching, anyway.  If you wonder why you can't make your life come out picture-postcard perfect like other Christian self-help books suggest you should, his plaint is worth your hearing.<br /><br />And, some days after I wrote this, I learned that Mike was killed in a car crash in October of 2003.  RIP, and \\"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\\"ght of the Lord is the death of His saints.\\"	2004-10-14

These sources have generated considerable skepticism and controversy in the past, so reader beware.<br /><br />The second part, focusing on the actual mission, is better.  Rodger Claire was granted access to the mission pilots themselves, and their stories are first rate.  They were superbly trained, highly motivated, and fiercely competitive.  While cross-training on the F-16 in the United States, they impressed the USAF trainers with their incisive technical questions.  At the time of this mission they were possibly the best fighter pilots in the world.<br /><br />This section of the book answers a lot of mysteries, such as how the mission succeeded on a single tank of fuel per plane, how they avoided enemy interception, and why one of them missed the target.  Also valuable is material from an interview with an Iraqi nuclear scientist, showing French perfidy in selling Saddam the reactor and uranium in the first place, and his eye-witness account of the Falcons swooping in to bomb his place of work.  Thankfully for him, he was gettin his car fixed.<br /><br />There are a number of annoying factual errors; for instance, Israel did not have F-4 Phantoms during the 1967 war, nor was the F-16 a U.S. Navy aircraft.  There are also some surprises.  Most of us know that mission pilot Ilan Ramon died in the Columbia disaster, but it's interesting to learn that another pilot, Iftach Spector, led the mistaken attack on the USS Liberty during the 1967 war.<br /><br />Given the caveats about the first part of the book, I recommend it heartily.  These brave pilots and their audacious mission bought the region a precious few more years to deal with Saddam. A bulls-eye!	2004-10-14

Atkinson has been connected with things military since childhood, so thankfully there is no arrogant media ignorance on display, as in some books by other reporters I've read recently.  There are no \\"on location from under the Humvee\\" dispatches, as mocked by warbloggers at the time.<br /><br />He keeps his own firmly inside-the-beltway liberal opinions mostly to himself throughout.  Here and there he does imply that the U.S. is to blame for the suffering of the Iraqi people under the fraudulent UN Oil-For-Food program; he baldly labels the pretexts for the war a \\"delusion\\"; and he hints that the war is all just about oil.  Of course, if that were the case, we could have imitated the French and just cut similarly lucrative and shameful deals with Saddam, instead of going to war for it.  But as I said, his professionalism is foremost in these pages.  It's a work of solid reportage, not polemic.<br /><br />Atkinson focuses on the top command of the division.  This is not as thrilling as a troopers-eye-view account might be, but it is actually more illuminating.  Like good commanders, the leaders of the 101st Airborne Division plan their logistics carefully, so we get a lot of background information on the battle.  Thus, the narrative lingers over the mini-quagmire of that spring, whereas the onrushing offensive operations seem to come to us from a distance.  The whole division itself is seldom present in this book, except in a couple of panorama scenes, viewed from the air or the side of the road.<br /><br />The central figure, Major General David Petraeus is drawn as a squared-away natural leader who thinks out loud a lot, solicitous of the welfare of the troops, nudging his officers along with an even but no-nonsense manner, and driving himself unsparingly.  Atkinson at times comes across as Petraeus's amanuensis.  His staff is expertly portrayed, from the bluff General Sinclair to the go-getter Col. Joseph Anderson.<br /><br />Special Forces soldiers make cameo appearances throughout the book.  With their beards and bill caps, they project a grungy, Joe Cool nonchalance.  Whenever Atkinson encounters them, they are lounging in intersections with their Toyota technicals, their secret work unseen.<br /><br />Atkinson relays a few of his own pratfalls, portraying himself as the FNG tenderfoot in the camp.  In one instance he can't find his gas mask until a soldier finds it at Atkinson's feet, whereupon the all clear sounds.<br /><br />At the end, Baghdad falls with a whimper, the 101st goes into occupation mode, and many of the principals rotate out.  Atkinson confesses to the emotional attachment that has grown up between him and the Screaming Eagles.  He feels capable of writing about the men and their experiences objectively, but knows that he will be heartbroken whenever he hears of fatalities from the 101st.  His objectivity is admirable; his reportage is enriching; and his esteem for these men is infectious.  Mission accomplished.etter Col.

Kevin Bazzana was able to get more people to talk about their memories of Gould, and the result is this very readable biography.  The author brings back the impact that Gould's 1955 Goldberg Variations had on the music world.  One record executive said that it was as if there had been a big run on a new printing of the Enneads of Plotinus.  Throughout, Gould's career and life is told in satisfying detail and insight.  He tries hard to explain Gould's musical contrariness, as in his mauling of Mozart's sonatas, but often has to simply yield and accept Gould's contrariness as such (though he intriguingly suggests that Gould may have been a musical forerunner of the postmodernists).  And of course there is ample celebration of Gould's genius and his enduring cult.<br /><br />According to Bazzana, he's a regular Victor Borge in the humor department.  But on this score as on so many others, Bazzana must largely concur with the received legend, while offering scattered counter-examples.  On balance, Gould was an excruciatingly unfunny humorist, a clotted, unreadable essayist, but also an entertaining raconteur, an unaffected star, and a proud Canadian.<br /><br />Bazzana's biography of Gould succeeds, but I was left wanting more.  For example, there doesn't seem to be any discussion of Gould's mysterious failure to record the crown jewel of Bach's oeuvre, The Art of the Fugue.  His organ rendition doesn't count, and may be seen as Gould's way of side-stepping the issue.  He could certainly play the fugues: they appear in any number of his concerts, and I especially treasure those that appear in his Russian lecture/concert on a Harmonia Mundi disc I own.  Fugue no. 1 sounds like the dawning of some grand insight.  Yet Gould never committed the whole thing to record on piano, and disappointingly, Bazzana doesn't offer any insight on why.<br /><br />There are some very minor errors of fact here and there.  For example, Bazzana apparently didn't realize that the Last Letters From Stalingrad, for which Gould wrote vocal sketches, were later proven to be forgeries.<br /><br />It is very good to have a mini-biography of Gould's teacher, Alberto Guerrero.  It's a shame that he made no commercial recordings, so that we could assess his influence on his famous pupil.<br /><br />Bazzana seeks to explain the oft-rumored Canadian Identity to his readers, as it applies to Gould.  Marshal McLuhan and Stephen Leacock are presented as exemplars of the Canadian spirit in communications technology and understated humor, respectively.  Like McLuhan, Gould's ideas about communications were ahead of their time.  Indeed, even with satellite communications and the technological miracles of the Internet Age, we may doubt that we have caught up with him yet.  Oscar Wilde would have been a natural on TV chat shows; maybe Gould would have fit right in sometime in the future, after a few more revolutions in technology.  It's as if he was a natural born genius at some field of endeavor that hadn't been invented yet, and so had to settle for realizing his visions by splicing magnetic tape.  And playing piano, of course.t here and there.

Well, no one can be on the cutting-edge forever, it seems.  The notion of a conservative satirist is no longer the novelty it was twenty years ago.  In this, his latest collection of magazine pieces, P. J.'s tank is running pretty low, sad to say.  These articles are mostly travelogues, with some observational humor here and there that is rarely more than wry.  There are plenty of good, pithy quotes and plenty of laughs, but no real guffaws to be had, no more spectacular leaping elbow drops from the top rope onto a hapless liberal meme.  It's as if he's gotten tired of his I-used-to-be-a-hippie-now-I-smoke-cigars schtick.  Or maybe the ascent of his imitators in talk radio has stolen his thunder.  Or maybe the experience of moving from Rolling Stone to The Atlantic and working with the late and much lamented Michael Kelly gave him ill-advised ideas about doing serious reportage.  Or maybe the times are just starting to pass him by.  Satire, the old adage notwithstanding, does _not_ write itself.<br /><br />Unlike previous collections, P. J. is content here to just slap the pieces together and stick a forward in front, rather than compose linking material for some ad-hoc meta theme.  Which is fine with me; that device was only ever a fairly transparent hook, anyway.  I didn't notice much stylistic revision this time around, either.<br /><br />In recent interviews P. J. has tried to head off such criticism.  He's in his fifties, he protests, how much immature squeezing-your-wingwang humor should he be expected to produce anymore?  Fair enough.  But it does seem as though he's getting tired of what he does, and hasn't yet found a new voice.  This collection shows him vamping in the meantime.	2004-08-08

A Swedish businessman of Persian descent publishes his America-themed quotations collection. But enough about that, let's talk about me! Many of these quotes were gleaned from the internet, and two or three of them were first posted on an online quotations forum by yours truly. I know this because I typed the things straight out of the books they appeared in, posted them, and then others posted them on their own websites. Now here they are in this oversize, double-column collection of quotes about Americans, America, and facets of life therein.<br /><br /> The quotes are admirably bi-partisan, with Gore Vidal and P. J. O'Rourke both getting prominent play. The author sources them as precisely as he can, but doesn't let hazy provenance get in the way of including a good quote. There are author and subject indexes, and the whole production provides hours of fun browsing. This is the best such collection I've seen in quite some time--no matter that it was &quot;outsourced&quot; to Sweden!	2004-08-04

Seeing the massive energy of the atom unleashed, in the archetypical mushroom cloud, is an arresting experience no matter how long ago these photos were taken.  The images are rather samey, save for some that show oddly botanical detail of some clouds, probably due to water vapor.  The test blasts have retro-sounding Army code names like FIZEAU, YANKEE, BAKER, MAGNOLIA, and etc.<br />There is no visual perspective-big and small blasts seem the same size due to different camera distances.  Some images taken from high-speed time lapse films seem like giant bacilli.  Some, irrespective of kilo- or megatonnage, seem like they are splitting the heavens.<br />Hats off to all the servicemen who were subjected to these tests.  It probably wasn't nice for the Pentagon to subject these men to these hazards, and I echo the wish that it never has to happen again.  But I do appreciate their sacrifice, because I think it was well worth it.<br />The author tosses in a sneer at the Strategic Defense Initiative in his end of book timeline.  But Reagan understood that nuclear weapons could not be un-invented, only rendered obsolete.  Like it or not, nukes are a fact of international life, and a wise leader will not try to wish them away.<br />The author wants to evoke a Strangelovian mood, but it's too late for that.  It makes a difference, whether nuclear superiority resides with free countries or tyrants, now as well as in the Fifties and Sixties.  America's nuclear arsenal kept the Soviets and their proxies  from gobbling up even more nations than they actually did.  The fact that America won the Cold War is, once and for all, A Good Thing, and it was these weapons, along with the MAD doctrine, that helped win it.  Better MET than red.	2004-07-06

It can't be!&quot;	A great first telling of the Columbia disaster.  The authors interviewed a score of persons involved at some point with the shuttle program, and seemingly spared no one's feelings, regardless of the access they were given.  We share the sinking dread of the junior engineers as they watch the foam strike, and are then denied photos of the orbiter by senior management from military surveillance vehicles.  And then comes the awful moment, to observers across the country, in Houston, and at NASA, when disaster strikes...<br />The final report of the investigative board saw little hope for NASA to effectively manage the shuttle program at the levels of quality control that the program required.  So the macro problem was not a case of sub-par people doing sub-par work, but of normal people doing normal work.  For the most complex machine ever invented, normal wasn't good enough.  Bureaucratic inertia would build up over time, trumping any system of feedback and cross-checks.  People in any organization eventually come to see what they expect to see, swamping the efforts of those individuals who strive to &quot;pound a problem flat.&quot;<br />Ultimately of course, if everyone is to blame then no one is to blame.  Every snowflake in an avalanche can plead &quot;not guilty&quot;.  That, plus the creeping obsolescence of the shuttle design and components led the investigative board to recommend replacing the shuttle altogether.  Does this mean the end of manned space flight from America?  I personally hope so.  We've learned so much more from projects like Voyager, Hubble, Chandra, and the like than from using the shuttle to put some elementary school's bean sprout dixie cup gardens into orbit.  But I suspect that the general public will not support the space program unless they have live astronauts to cheer for.  So, who knows what will come next.  For now, this book is a thorough, and thought-provoking account of what everyone hopes will be the final shuttle disaster.	2004-06-19

These are models of economy, which immediately grab the reader's interest and have lots of little surprises (not all of them pleasant).  Especially hilarious are his tales of his role in an MTV video, and of a protest stunt by anarchists that ended up looking like a protest against Italy.  (Sorry to be vague, but it defies summary.)<br />The rest of the book is a altie travel guide of the _Lonely Planet_ backroads style.  Sights range from the scenic to the seedy, emphasis on the off-beat, though there is a welcome, and unexpected, chapter on the city's gardens.<br />His affection for his town shines through most every passage of every section.  There may not be much left of the frontier, which a century and a half ago prompted Thoreau to say &quot;I must walk toward Oregon, and not toward Europe&quot;, but what's left is wild enough, and still distinctively American.	2004-06-11

Rosenthal interviewed an impressive cross-section of Israeli society, from all backgrounds and viewpoints.  It's especially affecting to read the interviews with the young people, whether Jewish, Muslim, or Christian, with their too-soon exposure to war's ugliness and their simultaneous brave hopes for the future.  Caution: many if not most of the interviewees are pseudonymous.<br />It's a far-ranging book, with too many interesting foci to list completely:  The decline of the collective ethic on Israel's kibbutzes.  The insular nature of the ultra-Orthodox communities, and the painfully high human cost of leaving.  The presence of ordinary vice and corruption, and how terrorists use the drug trade as a weapon of war.  A potted history of Zionism, with many personal reminiscences of the 1948 war.  Tours through the minority communities such as the Druze, the Bedouin, the Jews from Arab lands, and subcultures such as Russian prostitutes and gay Israelis.<br />Welcome inclusions are factual takedowns of widespread lies such as the Jenin \\"massacre\\".  But polemics are not the meat of the book, the people are.  It is very good to finally have some voices to put with the faces of this remarkable people.

This young Catholic Briton went traveling around the eastern Mediterranean, following in the footsteps of a late-antiquity monk, John Moschos.  He meets many elderly representatives of the declining Orthodox churches in their ramshackle abbeys and monasteries throughout the Near East.  Dalrymple had an amazingly keen ear for recording (or reconstructing) conversation, and the humor, quaintness, poignancy, and sometimes grief he evokes sounds true.  He listens with a straight face to monks discussing recent appearances of St. Stephen, listens to a broken old priest describing the forcible dispersal of his flock, even pays a visit to the tomb of John Moschos himself.  The church that houses it was once a thriving community of faith, but at the time of Dalrymple's visit only one old nun was left.<br />Some of the humor is at his own expense.  In Syria he tries to wrangle a visit to a remote community of archaic Christians, the Nestorians, or Assyrian Church.  He is rebuffed, but a helpful local suggests that he contact an emigre community of these believers--back in his neighborhood of Ealing!  \\"Such are the humiliations of the travel writer in the late twentieth<br />century: go to the ends of the earth to search for the most exotic heretics in the world, and you find they have cornered the kebab business at the end of your street in London.\\"<br />The book is marred by some ugly anti-Zionism that he must have soaked up in Britain during his university years.  He treats his escapades with the Turkish and Syrian authorities almost as comic opera, but unloads some real loathing on Israel.  Typical background passages begin something like, \\"After the 1948 war, in violation of international law, Israel...\\" as if the 1948 war were Israel's idea, or as if the Arab goal of exterminating the Jews were in accordance with international law.  Several of the accusations made by the Armenian priests in Israel cry out for fact-checking, but since this is a travel and not an investigative book, there is none.<br />Interposed through the text are excerpts and paraphrases from Moschos' book.  From these we revisit the ancient stylites and dendrites, who inflicted physical mortification upon themselves in the belief that suffering in this life made for an easier time in the afterlife.  Throughout, we also get a little archaeological background of different locations.  They aren't all ancient: The Baron hotel in Damascus still has Lawrence of Arabia's unpaid bill framed behind the front desk, though the gardens and ponds outside have long since been replaced with urban seediness.<br />A mostly fine travel book with a great premise.but since this is a travel and not an investigative book, there is none.<br />Interposed through the text are excerpts and paraphrases from Moschos' book.

And one of the unique things about the Jewish faith, is that it is the only major world religion whose adherents feel free to dispute with their Maker.<br />After his horrible traumas in the Holocaust, Wiesel thought for a while that he was through with religion.  But his own children came along, and he found himself teaching them Torah.  So he has stayed connected with his tradition, however uneasily, and has produced some genuine Jewish classics over the years, questioning all the while.<br />This tradition of dispute is the real subject here, not so much the sketches of the minor Biblical characters.  For each, Wiesel records their appearances in Scripture, and wonders why they meet the fates that they do.  &quot;Why&quot; is the constant refrain.  Why does Miriam get a harsher punishment than the others around her?  Why does Lot's wife look back; and why doesn't Lot?  Why is Aaron such a jellyfish?  The Almighty isn't talking, so Wiesel just records his puzzlement and sometimes his dismay, and moves on.<br />This book isn't as rewarding as his first collection of tales of the Hasidim, _Souls On Fire_.  Even the most goyish reader could feel part of the Hasidic family in that warm, wonderful book. This one isn't quite up to that level.  But he does take the reader places, and it is good to more closely consider these lesser Biblical characters.  Even if we don't get all the answers he asks for.	2004-05-16

How in the heck was it possible for anyone in the late 90s to grieve for the passing of detente?  Patriots were glad to have won the Cold War, and progressives were crushed over the collapse of international socialism.  But detente?  That dishonorable hodgepodge of political expedience and moral equivalence?<br />The author seems to think that the Soviet Union's decline and fall was obvious and common knowledge, and the right-wingers agitating for the administration not to be snookered by the Soviets' peace offensive were out of line.  So, therefore the military buildup in the late Carter and early Reagan years was unnecessary, because the money could have been spent on various liberal social programs.  It's a case of \\"yes, he saved the patient, but the _way_ he did it was wrong\\".  And she apparently doesn't care that all the liberal social programs got enacted anyway, at the cost of a balanced budget in the Eighties.<br />And she calls Solzhenitsyn's brave witness against the Gulag \\"inflammatory\\".  Sheesh!  What a weird book...	2004-05-12

A rather cheeky attempt to rope a number of 20th century heroes into the postmodern progressive corral.

But Dr. Hanson's theme is more subtle than merely listing the big hinges of fate.  The battles he picks caused less dramatic but still far-ranging influence on our policies and even our attitudes.  It's a very interesting read, as are all of VDH's writings.<br />I don't quite go along with some of the suppositions.  Sherman's march to the sea was far from the first punitive campaign in history, though he persuades me that Shiloh caused Sherman to take up that style of war.  The battle of Delium's influence must have been very subtle indeed, as the connecting thread is vanishingly faint, to my mind.  Invoking a what-if influence, of Socrates possibly having been killed in that battle, is cheating; for by that standard any battle that any future famous person survived would have to count as an influential battle.<br />The Shiloh section is best for the account of how careers were launched and scuttled, how reputations were born, and how myths were created.  His description of how the savagery of the fighting on Okinawa greased the skids for the deployment of the atom bombs is well done.  The Imperial Japanese expected a bloodbath, expected Okinawa to fall, but did not expect that their show of suicidal fanaticism would prompt the Americans to one-up their brutality.  And that's what stopped the war and, according to Hanson, provides precedent for Americans to escalate  the modern War on Terror way beyond what the jihadists bargained for.<br />Hanson's storytelling powers and erudition are wonderfully entertaining, whether you agree with his points or not.  The book's a bargain simply for the history lessons.	2004-04-24

The release of the Venona decryptions--showing that Alger Hiss was indeed a Soviet agent, the American Communist Party was indeed a tool of Stalin, and the martyrs of McCarthyism were indeed traitors to America and Western civilization--seems to have been received with less than open arms in academia.  No one should be shocked.  The revisionist mindset in history departments these days is set in concrete, and it'll take more than mere proof to disabuse these progressive fossils of their sentimental attachment to the Vanguard Generation of the 1930s-1950s.  Or, more charitably, such revelations as Venona should be expected to signal the beginning of a debate, not the end.<br />This book isn't really for the lay reader.  The authors minutely examine scholarly arguments against Venona, or arguments that attempt to \\"of course\\" it aside.  The refutations they deploy sound convincing to me.  The authors don't fight entirely fair.  They excoriate one revisionist author for mixing up the principals in one case, but confess to a similar error of their own in an endnote.  Throughout, the psychic indigestion of the revisionists is on display, as they try to salvage the reputations of their heroes.  They do so either by rejecting or distorting the evidence, or falling back into the \\"higher truth\\" position, in which spying for Stalin against America was just another form of action for social justice.<br />One bit of Venona controversy that seems to have fallen silent is the case of leftist gadfly journalist I. F. Stone, who does not appear in this book.  Apparently no case from the Venona decrypts can be made to back up Herbert Romerstein's accusation that Stone was a Soviet agent of influence for a while.  Instead, Stone appears to have rejected monetary offers from his would-be handlers, so far as Venona reveals.  To be fair, Haynes and Klehr weren't the ones who made that accusation in the first place.<br />The retired NKVD assassin Pavel Sudoplatov makes a cameo appearance.  The authors really should have put a caution flag next to his name, as the most explosive allegations from his book have never been proven.  But there he is, invoked to bolster the case against the Rosenbergs (which didn't really need bolstering, at this late date).<br />A sad bit of history is presented in an appendix.  It is a list of names of  mostly Baltic immigrants to America, who moved to the Soviet Union, were arrested and executed, and buried by the KGB.  Their names and bodies were recovered by Memorial, the Russian organization that searches for secret mass graves in Russia.  The bitter consequences of deluded idealism...<br />The fraudulent aura of progressivism that Stalinism had for so many Americans is still a mystery.  How a dream of a better world led these people to betray the most just country in history to the most oppressive country in history defies easy explanation.  Ignorance is no excuse, as the bloody nature of Soviet communism was well reported in the West almost from the Soviet Union's inception.  (If they couldn't believe Stalin's own ex-secretary, Boris Bazhanov, who would they have believed?)  Although leftist compilers of standard reference works are reported here to be distorting the Venona evidence, one can only hope for its lessons to start seeping into the curriculum, as well as the broader culture.

The fact that the climatological investigation into global warming is ongoing is no barrier to learning about all the legwork that has gone into it.  This account is especially welcome, as it is an objective account of how the idea of global warming has developed over the years.  It is literally a textbook example of the workings of aggregate knowledge.<br />Especially good is the account of climatology's trip up the blind alley of The Coming Ice Age in the 1970s.  This as much as anything tarred the proponents of the global warming hypothesis as a bunch of Chicken Littles who couldn't make up their minds.  But while it may have made convincing policy makers more difficult, like so many other missteps in science it ultimately led to a better understanding of what was really going on.  And many observed facts have survived through the revolutions of interpretation.  You can't argue with the Keeling Curve, which measures the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere, for instance.<br />The objectivity continues even in concluding sections, when contemporary politics enter the story.  In this account the Kyoto Protocols are a missed opportunity, although their shortcomings and the legitimate objections to them are fairly-enough presented.  Plus all the loose ends and shortcomings of the global warming model get spelled out in frank detail.  But the existing scientific consensus, that CO2 buildup is real, artificial, growing, and a menace, gets the last word.<br />Dr. Weart's call to action in the end is bitter: more regulation, higher taxes, the whole &quot;wise men&quot; approach to public policy.  Principal blame for the crisis is affixed to the U.S., too-as if it is America and not the sainted Third World burning down the world's rainforests.  Some of the prescriptions sound like they would indeed be money savers though, such as aggressively heading off methane leaks by mending pipelines.  In all, this is an informative, challenging account of how we know what we think we know about global warming.

Buckley asserted that liberals claim to want to give an airing to &quot;other views&quot;, but are then shocked and appalled that there _are_ other views.  More recently, Jonah Goldberg said that the word &quot;conservative&quot; in the news media has contracted to simply mean the position you the reader are meant to disapprove of.  Both quotes could serve as epigraphs for _Arrogance_.<br />This book is billed as a prescription for remedies of liberal media bias.  It is not.  It is a second helping of exposure of journalistic malfeasance on the part of the New York Times and the big three networks.  What pointers Goldberg does offer come toward the end, and even then are merely hooks upon which to hang more indictments.  It's clear that the publishers, who may be liberal themselves but aren't allergic to the profits a sequel to a conservative bestseller would bring, wanted Goldberg to serve up lots more of the same.  In one of her books Ann Coulter noted how reviewers had for years and years referred to popular conservative books as &quot;surprise bestsellers.&quot;  A surprise to who?  Not to Warner Books anymore, not with the bills to pay on that Time-Warner merger with AOL!<br />To liberals, Bernard Goldberg may be a traitor, but the attempts by some of them to paint him as a hack or a phony have fallen flat.  You have to be very good to stay on at the the major networks for nearly thirty years, as Goldberg did.  The efforts to smear him merely give more credence to his charge of herd mentality.<br />It's an important distinction that Goldberg insists on: there is no secret liberal media NKVD, keeping everyone in line.  Rather, it's a case of &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot;.  Regardless of how educated or smart or possessed of goodwill people may be, they are still taken aback, at least momentarily, if it slips out that one of their number does not share their worldview.  Now replace the set of educated, smart people of goodwill with self-impressed, arrogant products of politically correct Blue State journalism schools, and you can see the trouble coming a mile off.<br />Goldberg goes easy on the statistics and heavy on the dismaying anecdotes.  Indeed, if some people continue to dismiss his work as &quot;anecdotal&quot;, you can be sure that that means they are nervous that the peasants might be listening.  His chapters are arranged thematically: race, feminism, sports, etc.  His tone is a rather yammery blend of sarcasm and incredulity, but the sympathetic reader can take this as proof of how outraged he is over how far his profession's standards have fallen.  Frequently, he pauses in his description of how a particular story was misreported, to distance himself from the issue or the principals.  His only goal is improving journalism, he says, not joining the right-wing media watchdogs.  (Though truth to tell, another watchdog of Goldberg's experience and savvy surely wouldn't hurt.)<br />The book appeared before a couple of recent media feeding frenzies, which would have fit right in.  As I write, the national press corps is running Democratic National Committee talking points as breaking news, making a story out of the quality of President Bush's denials of decades-old and still unproven allegations of being AWOL from the Texas Air National Guard.  At the same time they are stonewalling for the moment allegations of infidelity on the part of the current Democrat frontrunner.  In the internet age, it won't work.

Abolitionism was coming to political life. Old friendships among Boston's upper-classes were strained, and new alliances forged, as the times shifted.  These long-extinct controversies are minutely chronicled here, with the end of showing how formative they were on Ralph Waldo Emerson. This book tells how Emerson found his place in this flood of events.<br />I chiefly know Emerson as an aphorist, so it was mildly surprising to read how his contemporaries viewed his Lyceum lectures in much the same light.  &quot;A poet, not a philosopher&quot; is the general reaction to his early sallies.  Emerson was first-rate, from a family of first-rate men, and everyone knew it.  His intellectual promise was generally conceded, but his offerings were faulted for lacking in coherence, notable mostly for brilliant _bon mots_.  Emerson reproaches himself in his journals for not tackling the big issues of the day.  When things finally click in his mind and he produces _The American Scholar_, the impracticality of its prescriptions is not diminished by its ringing tones.<br />Yet I suspect that Emerson's slipperiness contributed to his works' staying power.  If he had constructed a tidy, interlaced, balanced philosophical system, then he would have been comprehended, absorbed, and done with long ago.  But as his best sentences urge the reader on, rather than drawing a map, they continue to inspire down to this day.  &quot;Hitch your wagon to a star&quot;, indeed.<br />The book is valuable for introducing the reader to the Bostonian intelligentsia of the 1820s and 1830s, and for reproducing this stage in Emerson's career.  Even Thomas Carlyle makes a cameo appearance, as Emerson's moral and financial support helps establish the Scot's reputation in the U.S.  I learned a lot--and will probably learn a lot more if I make time to re-read this book.  It's the sort of work that makes you want to go and study up, so that you can come back and tackle it again; it's that good.It's the sort of work that makes you want to go and study up, so that you can come back and tackle it again; it's that good.	2004-02-11

Sierra Leone at the time of this writing was painfully creeping out of a collapsed state, a nightmare world of omni-hostile gangs, rogue militias, soul-wringing atrocities: the whole awful image of an imploded African society.  As one interviewee says, the culture had been drawn down to zero.  What was the cause?  What could the solution be?<br />Author Bergner could easily have perpetrated a standard piece of parachute journalism on this wretched backwater sorespot, but he didn't.  He spent some quantity time here, and followed developments.  He writes with journalistic vividness which only sometimes strains for an elegaic tone.  Most of the time his material supplies all the drama necessary.<br />We meet a missionary family, fired up with a purposeful vision for social justice.  We meet them again some time later, after all their good works have been reduced by the civil war and general lawlessness to ashes, and with their last project, a school, threatened with abandonment.  It's a heart-rending example of how so much of the West's very best altruistic efforts in Africa have been dashed to spray in the end.<br />We also meet victims of the guerillas' amputation squads.  One, a man named Lamin, somehow kept his equanimity, while a compatriot who suffered the same horrible fate lapsed into catatonia.  Lamin's impressions of New York while there to be fitted for prosthetic hands are especially interesting.<br />A detachment of British Marines, reassuringly determined and competent in comparison the Keystone Kops-like UN troops who had been held hostage by rebels, set to work restoring order in the capital and training the remnants of the national army.  But is this rescue or re-colonialization?  The question troubles few natives, but Bergner scrupulously takes note of those troubled few.<br />More problematic is an expatriate Rhodesian mercernary, fighting rebels with an old Soviet attack helicopter, and being none too careful about avoiding civilians.  The \\"correct\\" attitude is to loathe him--yet his fighting in the field saves the capital, and his money-favoring among locals eases a lot of hurt that would otherwise go uneased.<br />Bergner candidly admits the psychic indigestion that the racial connotations of the whole ugly mess stir up within him.  He protests to some natives who all but quote Kipling and Joseph Conrad at him, insisting that whites are fully as capable of the degradation happening there as the rebels and gangs have been.  But in Sierra Leone in the Nineties, it is the missionaries and the British trying to salvage this country, and not the other way around, and Bergner records his creeped-out reaction when he entertains the idea that the self-deprecating natives may be right.  Some otherwise astute Western observers are frequently guilty of denying Africans their full measure of humanity, of capacity for good and evil.  In their view, the Africans are just a deterministic mass of victims of colonialism, symbols of Western sin, with no moral agency of their own.  The natives Bergner quotes will be as kryptonite to such readers.<br />The Ghanaian scholar George Ayittey, in his book _Africa in Chaos_, deplored the vampiric kleptocracies that took hold in so many African countries after the end of colonialism.  He proposed trying to reconstitute some of the pre-colonial tribal structures that had allowed for relatively peaceful conflict management.  But how could this approach work in Sierra Leone, which was not only as artificial an entity as most other sub-Saharan countries but also an experimental one, like Liberia?<br />What could the solution be?  No answers here.  This is an impression of this woeful land, not a proposal for remedies.  One can only hope that, with the presence of the British and more competent UN troops, the wounds will begin to heal.

It was the furthest inland that the Marines had ever fought, and was surely the most reported operation in the Corps history, too.<br />The authors are Vietnam War Marine veterans, and they do a good job in telling the tale.  There's very little chest-thumping, just a matter-of-fact reportage of the Marines' planning, setbacks, foibles(!), and determination.<br />Strewn throughout are many interesting episodes.  During the assault over the Baghdad bridge, a photographer gets underfoot so much that the authors later look him up and use one of his photos of that battle for the back cover of the book.  The adrenaline-pumped frenzy of battle is convincingly evoked in one scene, and the point is made that Marines don't count kills as pilots and snipers do, but kill as a team.  One combat team has a line of civilian vehicles in train, reporters and spooks and specwarriors.  The press seem to get along well with the troops, respecting the secrecy of the special forces, and not getting in the hair of the regular troops.  A tank machine-gunner shoots a couple of Baathist goons in the midst of a crowd of Iraqi civilians, who appear nonchalant enough about the Abrams behemoth firing at them.  The interpreters explain to the tank commander that the simple village folk think that the Americans' technology enables them to fire into crowds and only hit the bad guys.  But war is a sledgehammer, not a scalpel, as the authors say.<br />Midway, as a column of young Marines file by, the authors burst with pride, slapping their shoulders and shouting encouragement and congratulations, tearing up as they do so.  It's an infectious sentiment for anyone who takes pride in our armed services, whatever their opinion of the war.	2004-02-02

Author Worrall takes this late development as a pretext for revisiting the Mark Hofmann case, from several years previously.  Dickinson is really just a walk-on in this book, as the principals are Hofmann and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.<br />Only the first bit and a few sections later are really concerned with the forged Dickinson poem.  Worrall's treatment of her life and poetry is brief and fair-enough.  A in-depth reading isn't really called for in this book, so Dickinson fans oughtn't be too disappointed not to find more literary analysis.  Though she is billed as a co-headliner in this story, she is actually more of a footnote.<br />An unprepared reader might be overwhelmed by the quickly multiplying number of characters in the first chapters, as the poem goes to auction and more and more experts and dealers get consulted.  But these are soon moved offstage as the viewpoint switches to Hofmann's.  We also get digressive chapters on the history of forging, which are interesting but are obviously makeweight.<br />The implied exposure of shady doings at the big auction houses never comes to pass, apart from some fuming quotes from people who had been burned by the forgeries.<br />The meat of the book is the telling of how Hofmann forged important Mormon documents, playing the top church leadership like a pawnshop Gibson in a Pete Townshend impersonation contest.  The technical details of how Hofmann worked his dishonest magic are amazing enough, but more so is how brutally accurately he sized up the church's leaders.  For one legendary document, he took a chance and left it vulnerable to carbon dating, knowing that the church wanted the document to be true and would not destroy a portion of it to date it.  The Mormon church gets a very rough ride in this story, especially in the background material, and it's hard not to feel that they couldn't have tried to be more skeptical, lest the sky fall.<br />A bibliophile blanches to think how many forged Hofmann manuscripts and autographs are still out there, perhaps even shaping our view of history, as the Mormon documents did for awhile.  I don't know what use a natural talent for forgery could be put to in a law-abiding life, but he certainly mis-used his to the hilt.

She also quotes at length from manuscripts for the same purpose.  We flit from one invention to the next, in no seeming order--not that any is really needed--and get a brief explanation of where it came from, when experts think it came into use, and some enjoyable examples, both written and pictorial.

This is pretty much the same sort of collection as his book _Zany Afternoons_ was, and it is a pleasant surprise to see that there is no recycled material from the earlier book to this one.<br />In case you are unfamiliar with McCall's work, he used to be an automobile advertisement illustrator back in the Fifties.  He uses the same style to the same retro-cheesy effect in his spoofs of old Popular Mechanics articles, imaginary stomping grounds of the rich &amp; famous of the Twenties and Thirties, and lots of gibes at his old home, Canada.<br />The original written material for this book is so-so, but it's only a page long, every thirty pages or so.  The cartoons, with their marvelous verisimilitude of the real period pieces they send up, are just great.  McCall is a master at capturing eras that never were.	2004-01-09

In this telling, the job that the SF teams did in equipping, uniting, and marshalling the ragtag and mutually hostile NA armies was nothing short of a Special Operations clinic.  The battle scenes are savagely vivid, and unapologetic in the satisfaction the operators took in eliminating the terrorists and the Taliban fighters.<br />It's interesting to get the fighters' take on some issues which played quite differently in the press.  According to the Green Berets that Moore interviewed, \\"American Taliban\\" John Walker Lindh was no little boy lost, but a committed Al-Qaeda terrorist, who probably helped torture and kill CIA prisoner Mike Spann.  And there's an amusing bit about how the operators came close to drawing straws to see who got to punch out the clownish Fox News correspondent, Geraldo Rivera.<br />It's sad to read of incidents which indicate that the regular Army brass still doesn't \\"get\\" the idea of unconventional warfare.  The Green Berets teams here were urged not to outfight Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, although they could if they had to, but more to outthink them, which they for the most part did.  Yet, chary of taking casualties, the top command reined in the SF at crucial moments, even though the soldiers were completely willing to give their lives to bag the top terrorists.  Hence, according to Moore, the fiasco at Tora Bora.<br />Things go less than swimmingly in places, such as in the Northern Alliance faction of the priapic megalomaniac General Naderi.  Also, the unnamed team that went into Tora Bora did not bond well with the mujahedin, committing many social fauxes pas, which may have helped Bin Laden to escape.<br />Delta Force, the Navy SEALS, and the British and Australian SAS were of course in this fight, too.  But this book makes it sound like the Green Berets were the whole show on the ground, with those other forces reduced to walk-on roles.  And that indeed may have been the case, who knows.  But it's hard to argue with the results: The Taliban ousted and al-Qaeda severely punished and an embryonic democracy installed within scant weeks of 9/11.  One can only hope that the example set by the performance of the Green Berets in this war will be heeded by Pentagon planners in future wars--and by America's enemies.ALS, and the British and Australian SAS were of course in this fight, too.

I've never made any headway with Buechner's fiction, but this book reveals him as a superb aphorist.  These essays were written to blow the dust off of shopworn religious words, to enable the reader to get at the great Christian themes afresh.  They succeed--each essay is a pearl of homey wisdom and quiet wonder, soaked in tenderness and sensitivity and gentle humor.  What's more amazing was that they were written at the close of the Sixties, during the Jesus Freak thing, yet very little residue of that era clings to them.  They are darn near timeless.<br />This first of three volumes of theological essays is the best, but the other two, _Whistling in the Dark_, and _Peculiar Treasures: A Biblical Who's Who_, are also well worth dipping into.  Readers who have enjoyed these collections of aphorisms better than Buechner's fiction and other long form writing would probably enjoy _Listening to Your Life : Daily Meditations with Frederick Buechner_, which is a sampler of all his work.	2003-11-29

We get a three or four page long architectural history of each cathedral, a couple of exterior shots, a view down the main sanctuary, and several closeups of various details, statuary, and art.  Most of these cathedrals are so wonderful that they could be made the subject of books of their own, of course.  But this visual symphony brings us up close and personal with arguably the greatest treasures the European Middle Ages bequeathed to posterity.<br />The only mild disappointment for me is that not much mention is made of the gigantic lost abbey church of Cluny, which was in the late Romanesque style.  One of the better uses of computer imaging these days is the virtual reconstruction of that edifice.<br />Wonderful books like this are why coffee-tables were invented!	2003-11-25

What a rush of nostalgia this compilation of MAD art brings back!  I first started reading MAD as a late pre-teen, in the early Seventies.  As I collected issues, I came into possession of some older copies, from which I got my first impressions of the lately concluded Sixties.  The early MAD, freshly spawned from EC Comics back when William Gaines had a buzzcut, didn't interest me.  But once he let his hair down and assembled his famous Usual Gang Of Idiots, the resulting humor and satire was a surefire hit with smart-alecky adolescent boys like me.<br />This collection presents a couple of pages of biography on each artist, along with a few panels of their work.  I remembered most all of them from my era, but some were rediscoveries for me.  Sergio Aragones, Jack Davis, Paul Coker, Jr., Al Jaffee with his goony inventions, Dave Berg--to name them is to summon to mind a favorite riff in the greatest cartooning ensemble ever assembled.  Possibly the most poignant was the sad case of Don Martin, who drew those jug-headed characters in those &quot;One Fine Day&quot; episodes.  Through illness and unspecified other problems, he was forced into an unwanted collaboration with the equally talented Duck Edwing, and then decamped altogether to an imitator, before passing away not too long ago.<br />If you are not familiar with MAD, then you certainly can't be expected to have all these fond memories.  The social satire is dated in a retrospective like this, too. But coming to the collection cold, you'll still find something to chuckle at, surely.  With so much talent on display, it'd be impossible not to.	2003-11-21

For all the correspondence, interrogation transcripts and memos excavated from the Soviet archives, one archive remains forever closed: Stalin's implacably bloody mind.<br />Brent and Naumov chillingly recreate the omni-paranoiac climate among the Soviet leadership in the late Stalin era.  These people had survived wildly irrational purges in the Thirties, but they best of all knew on what shaky ground they stood.  Any hint of independence, any perceived threat to Stalin's dominance, could land them in the execution cellars.<br />The trouble is, Stalin rarely confided his plans to paper, so there is no smoking gun to be found.  This sheaf of documentation fleshes out what the people involved said, certainly, and when they said it.  But as the authors admit, they are not really much closer to learning the purpose of the whole grim charade.  We don't even get as much detail in some instances, such as the Stalin-ordered murder of the prominent Soviet theater director Solomon Mikhoels, as was available in some Soviet-era books.<br />The elusiveness of the authors' task is illustrated by their use of sources.  In addition to the archival material, they draw material from the memoirs of Molotov, Khrushchev, and retired NKVD assassin Pavel Sudoplatov.  The authors are perfectly above board about the general unreliability of these memorists, so it says something that, even with the availability of the archives, they are reduced to consulting those books.<br />This admirable but ultimately unsuccessful book demonstrates the enduring mystery of the evil of Stalin.	2003-11-21

Once he gets that justification for the book's subtitle out of the way, we are treated to a serviceable biography of Cook, coupled with an enjoyable travelogue of Horwitz's adventures.<br />At this late date Cook cannot be restored to his former place as a hero of Nineteenth Century Civilization.  But, as Horwitz demonstrates, neither does he deserve to be reduced to a simple gaslight villain of the multi-culti crowd.  Horwitz explores his origins and rather enigmatic personality, retracing his path, recording the thumps of colliding cultures on his voyages.  Some encounters went very well, others badly, for both sides.  Horwitz neatly punctures the noble savage stereotype at one point, relating the fate of a French explorer who was under the spell of Rousseau, and felt the islanders to be harmless innocents, &quot;new sprung from Nature&quot;.  The natives killed him anyway.<br />Horwitz plays his own travels mostly for laughs, chronicling himself in pratfall after pratfall, in the midst of crude, wisecracking Aussies and Kiwis.  It's great fun, and we do occasionally draw some illuminating contrasts between his travels and Cook's.  But it's mostly just fun, which, after all, is what travel is supposed to be.<br />Blue Latitudes is another insightful romp through distant lands--waters, in this case--with freelancer Tony Horwitz.  Thank goodness for lovers of travel writing he can't seem to land a real job!	2003-11-21

Consider this passage, about the political climate in Britain before World War One:<br />\\"At the time, conflict unceasing grew year by year to a more dangerous intensity at home, while abroad there gathered sullenly<br />the hurricane that was to wreck our generation.  Our days were spent in the furious party battles..., while always upon the horizon deadly shapes grew or faded, and even while the sun shone there was a curious whisper in the air.\\"<br />Who could the author of such Churchillian lines be but Winston Churchill himself?  The stately but rarely stentorian pacing and tone, imitations of which are rarely successful, still impresses upon the reader the power and beauty of the English language.<br />These biographical essays, written while Churchill was in political exile in the Thirties, were collected in book at the end of that decade.  His majestically simple (or simply majestic) writing brings long-gone controversies and personalities back to life, if unavoidably suffused with the aura of the author's own personality.<br />Some notables that would seem to have been natural subjects for this book are missing: Gandhi, Lloyd George, Edward VII.  But an American reader only passingly acquainted with the luminaries of early 20th century Britain would be interested in Churchill's memories of the First Earl of Birkenhead, Herbert Henry Asquith, and George Nathanael Curzon.  The pieces are light on biographical detail and heavy on evaluation, but Churchill's estimation of most of these people is generous.  He dismisses George Bernard Shaw as a jester, gallantly defends the ex-Kaiser from the worst of the late war-time propaganda, and warns of the rising influence of Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.  The reader is also reminded from time to time that Churchill was indeed a politician, as in the essay on Lord Fisher, in which he deflects blame for some WWI naval setbacks onto that gentleman.<br />Excepting Walpole, probably no statesman's collected bread and butter writing has ever been so memorable, or made for such good reading.d butter writing has ever been so memorable, or made for such good reading.	2003-10-28

Each entry provides the plane's specs, variants, and production dates, and the narrative extensively details the craft's history and significance.  Author Spick is agreeably unsparing with his opinions on the planes, in one entry slamming the then-Labour government of Britain for providing advanced aviation technology to the Soviets, resulting in the creation an advanced Russian jet fighter.  Unfortunately, space constraints prohibit the inclusion of very much entertaining trivia for even the most famous fighters.  I would have liked to have seen much more about the F-86 and MiG 15 rivalry, for example.  But these entries succeed in interesting the reader enough to want to learn more.<br />An unforgivably sloppy editing error mars this otherwise excellent manual.  In the section on the most famous fighter of World War II, the Supermarine Spitfire, there appears a photo of the Republic F-84E Thunderjet.  In the section on the Thunderjet, the missing Spitfire photo is featured.  *Groan!*<br />The book is a tall, thick paperback, with pictures and text printed right down into the seams.

The predictably excellent photos (except for one field portrait where the camera's autofocus missed the subject) are a wonderful documentary of a single day in the globe-spanning mission of America's military.<br />Familiar images inevitably occur: Drill sergeants bawling out rattled recruits; wide-angle nose shots of fighter jets, flight deck sailors giving &quot;launch&quot; hand signals to carrier pilots; mud-slathered soldiers crawling through training courses, anonymity-suggesting group photos; and individual portraits showing the full range of humanity that calls America home.<br />There are also plenty of pleasing novelties, at least to me.  A soldier in Hawaii snaps a salute while carrying a surfboard.  Soldiers run station drills around a golf green, the only one on the one-hole course, in the Korean DMZ. A SEAL emerges, like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, from the water.  A seemingly prosaic picture of a cadet eating upon closer inspection reveals a meal of pancakes, cake, nachos, a pork chop, a hot dog, and other unharmonious victuals. Women and families are plentifully represented throughout.<br />We get representative shots of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield, a rear view of President Bush disembarking from Air Force One, a National Security Agency lab, and pictures of the troops in Afghanistan on the job.  The closest thing to actual trouble that was going on on this day, that was allowed to be photographed, was a forensic investigator examining a Marine's sabotaged parachute.  So, there are no pictures of military intelligence giving prisoners an interrogation, though there is a picture of Camp Gitmo.<br />This is a splendid album, technically and thematically, of America's best.	2003-10-08

The Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1939 was too much for many; Khrushchev's 1956 speech denouncing Stalin and his invasion of Hungary the same year were the last straw for others.  For the present crop, 9/11 is in the process of separating the lockstep lefties from the genuine friends of humanity.  Which way will Paul Berman, the author of _Terror and Liberalism_, break?<br />It is refreshing to hear an unequivocal condemnation of both Islamist terrorism and progressive anti-semitism from a non-silly Leftist.  The first time I ever encountered the writings of Paul Berman was in the late Eighties, during his jousts in _The New Republic_ with David Horowitz and Peter Collier, over the latter duo's book _Destructive Generation:  Second Thoughts About the Sixties_.  Now here comes this book, which hardly seems like the work of the same thinker.  I haven't been paying too much attention to him in the past decade, so I probably missed a lot of changes in these eventful times.<br />The tone of the book verges on the sonorous in passages, as if he were half-consciously minding the cadeneces of his sentences.  There are some errors of fact-it was Army Rangers and not Marines who were attacked in Mogadishu, and Arab terrorists have never excluded Israeli civilians from their range of targets--which are not serious barriers to following his points.<br />Unlike some other recent writers who have attempted to answer the question, \\"Why do they hate us?\\", Berman looks not to clashing civilizations, or to Islam's commands to wage perpetual holy war, but to a single Egyptian scholar, Sayyid Qutb.  After taking a tour through the 19th century anarchists, the 20th century totalitarian systems, and Albert Camus' parsing of those movements, Berman trace's Qutb's influence in the pan-arabist movement, and thence in the modern Islamic terrorist organizations.  (The tyrant-hero of Berman's generation of Sixties radicals, Fidel Castro, does not figure here, nor does the mercifully truncated Sandinista regime.  Irrelevant to his thesis, or too close to home?)<br />The main body of the book is devoted to asserting that the modern jihad is a mass pathology, as were those previous movements.  Rational onlookers can rarely believe the madness unfolding before their eyes, and so proceed to make excuses for the madmen.  This is why progressive voices ululated ever louder against Israel the more grievously Israel suffered from suicide bombings.  There are several fine passages in these sections illustrating this phenomenon, and are the book's main value, to me.<br /><br />He rolls a gutter ball in the final part, calling for a revival of the post-WWII \\"Third Way\\" of the European non-Communist Left, and how it headed off deeper Communist inroads into Western European nations.  Yeah, the \\"Third Way\\", together with umpty-bajillion dollars from the American Marshal Plan, and a half-century of costly military commitment from the United States (which was borne in spite of all the insults, free-loading and ingratitude from the allies from time to time), did just that.  \\"As we go ploughing along\\" as the fly said to the ox...<br />He also gives in to Bush-bashing at the end.  And the mock-moral aura of internationalism finally proves too much to resist, too.  But when the allies would rather cozy up to Saddam, and transnational progressives are fist-pumping over the massacre of Israeli civilians, just how big a sin is Bush's cultural tone-deafness?  If moral dryrot has eaten out the heart of Europe, it's hardly Dubya's fault for not further abasing ourselves, trying to get into their good graces.  Especially after what we've suffered!  Let them examine themselves.  Let *them* grow spines!<br />But this non sequitur ending to this informative book need not stop anyone from profiting from Berman's readings and insights.  It's obvious that, unlike so manyother progressive cheerleaders for terrorism, he is in full possession of a living soul, and that 9/11 was no 1939 for him.any other progressive cheerleaders for terrorism, he is in full possession of a living soul, and that 9/11 was no 1939 for him.	2003-09-06

According to Ms. Ravitch, pressure groups have turned school textbooks into consensus monsters, inoffensive as gruel and just as light in content. I don't think I could face twelve years of school if I knew I was going to have to swallow this much pabulum in place of solid information.<br />What distinguishes this book from the usual laundry list of educrats at play is Ms. Ravitch's insider status.  She was present when these \\"guidelines\\" were hatched, and shares her dismay at the enshrinement of liberal hypersensitivity in the school curriculum.  What's also different is that she details attacks from both the right and the left.  She comes down hard on both, but makes it clear that publishers are more cowed by left-leaning watchdogs.  \\"Racist\\" carries more sting as an reproach than \\"immoral\\".<br />Interestingly, we see in one instance the Frankensteinish nature of textbook censorship.  One social studies book was written by a leftist academic of impeccable anti-American credentials.  Yet his book was still flayed by complainers of all conceivable stripes.  Thus did censorship break loose from the control of its creators, and turn on them instead...<br />Ravitch includes a very useful reading list of her own.  Most of the books are old--which is to say, they have stood the test of time--but she is not trying to build a better yesterday.  Rather, she is trying to help concerned parents and teachers take their child's education back from the chronic takers of offense, who have somehow gotten veto power over the textbook publishing business.  One can only hope this book's message spreads far and wide.	2003-07-18

There's a self-deprecating sports article, in which he proposes the sport of oak tree racing.  There are some quite funny and surprisingly touching dog stories.  The man could make *anything* a joy to read!<br />But the meat of the \\"selected nonfiction\\" section is the 1930s reportage of the California migrants, which would later become the basis of his Depression novels.  It is a searing experience even seventy years later, being made to watch formerly solid American citizens being ground into the mire by poverty, malnutrition, and hopelessness.<br />Even his much-denounced Vietnam coverage has unmistakably Steinbeckian passages of humanity.  He goes for a combat patrol in an AC-47, a \\"Magic Dragon\\", and frankly confesses his fear.  He flashes back to conversations with combat journalists and ordinary soldiers, who were killed very shortly thereafter.  He accurately contrasts the omnipresent threat of guerrilla attacks with the more formal setpiece battles of previous wars--and portrays the confusion this arouses in the public back home.<br />The final bit is the republished _America and Americans_, which is one long cry of \\"Where are we going, and why are we in this handbasket?\\"  Perfectly understandable for someone of his age and background encountering the Sixties for the first time... But even here his native American optimism refuses to let him despair.  He concludes, \\"We have failed sometimes, taken wrong paths, paused for renewal, filled our bellies and licked our wounds; but we have never slipped back--never.\\"	2003-07-13

Young Mr. Woodward has a sympathetic vibration in his soul for ruins, and communicates this passion to the reader most convincingly.  Ruins of all kinds in Europe and the UK are explored here: Edwardian houses, medieval abbeys, Italian towns and palaces that were victims of recent earthquakes, the great Roman ruins, artificial ruins for the gardens of cultured gentry, and even imaginary ruins, Picturesque-era paintings of landmarks as they might appear after the fall of civilization.<br />The usual Romantic era luminaries make appearances: Byron, the Shelleys, Keats, inspired by the Italian ruins to reflect on the grandeur that was Rome.  Possibly the saddest passage is on the destruction of English country manors, which had been commandeered by the army during WWII, and were beyond the owners' ability to repair at war's end.  Woodward says that so many of these were destroyed in the Fifties that the loss to British heritage rivals that of the Dissolution of 1536, when the abbeys were closed by Henry VIII.<br />This is a ramble, not a tour, so don't expect a clearly laid out thesis.  Strikingly, Woodward's strongest expression of nostalgia is not for the famous ruins as they were when they were intact, but for when they were overgrown and seldom-visited.  He relates Stendhal's account of a visit to the Colosseum, where the traveler saw an Englishman riding his horse on the floor of the arena.  &quot;I wish that could be me,&quot; grumps Woodward.  From him I learn that there was even a book published in the 1850s, cataloging the plantlife growing on the Colosseum.  Some of it was quite exotic, the seeds having been brought there with the wild animals for the circuses.  Now the place is well hosed with weedkiller.<br />Ruins of such antiquity are not found in my area of the world, apart from Indian mounds.  But wherever you live, a book like this will cause you to gaze at your surroundings with a keener eye for the past.with a keener eye for the past.	2003-07-12

Sorry, couldn't help it!<br />This is a fun, fascinating layman's account of the controversial theory of cryptozoic global glaciation, how it may have been the trigger behind the rise of complex life, and the fieldwork and theorizing that led to it.  Another book, _Great Feuds in Science_, detailed how great science really gets done, not just with experimentation and evidence collection, but with clashes of personalities and battling reputations.  This is in the same vein, as we follow Paul Hoffman and his allies and opponents through a decade of geological work, in pursuit of evidence supporting or disproving the Snowball theory.<br />Ms. Walker's intimate style is a bit off-putting, if you're used to the more nuts-n-bolts science writing of an Isaac Asimov or Timothy Ferris.  And this book really could have used some portraits, diagrams, and other illustrations.  Portraits, especially, given the up-close-and-personal rendering of the principals.  But it will keep your interest to the end, and give the reader a sense of discovery, as the bits of the puzzle fall into place.  The last chapter is a prognostication on the possibility of a future snowball.  Chilling...	2003-07-07

Anyone uninterested in the social, political, historical, and geological background to the famous eruption can just skip to its chapter, about halfway through the book.  Simon Winchester has done an admirable job collecting and collating interviews, logs, diaries, reports, barographs, tide meter readings, you name it, to recreate the the horrific disaster, and set a few earlier errors straight.<br />One observer looks towards the beach, and see a monstrous wave, higher than the palm trees, sweeping along the shore.  Others take note of the sea in the strait, writhing and surging, even though there is no wind and no clouds.  Sailors caught in the ashfall suffer electric shocks from the charged cloud.  A stone residence on a hill 110 feet high is destroyed by a wave that overtopped it by twenty feet.  The sea becomes a slick of ash, pumice, debris, and bodies.  (Winchester announces that he is censoring himself, in that last detail.) A woman in Ceylon who is killed by a surge is the most distant victim of the volcano.  The airwave circles the globe seven times.  The violent sunsets are recorded by landscape painters for years afterwards.<br />The run-up to the dramatic parts is a fairly interesting history of the Dutch in the East Indies, stuffed to bursting with footnoted asides.  Krakatoa is the focal point throughout, though.  Winchester even pinpoints the earliest Dutch map to represent the island, and then the first one to name it.  There is an unmistakeably British thatchy-tweedy-fussiness in his manner.  Even in the climactic narrative of the disaster, he finds room for a footnote to explain that Macassar was the source for an oil that spoiled wood finish, and necessitated the invention of a lace furniture drapery called an \\"antimacassar\\".<br />As for his idea that Krakatoa launched radical Islam in Indonesia, that's probably impossible to prove.  The Japanese takeover of Dutch Pacific possessions in World War II, and the Saudi practice of exporting and subsidizing fundamentalist Wahabhi madrassas around the world probably had more to do with it.  But it is certainly something to think about.<br />All in all, this is an informative and at times exciting account of one of the biggest and certainly the loudest natural disaster in recorded human history.Indonesia, that's probably impossible to prove.

The fearsomely learned art critic and former National Gallery curator Kenneth Clark juxtaposes details from paintings with one another, and compares and contrasts them.  The original 1938 work was in black and white; this book is in color, and the paintings have been restored in the interim, too.<br />It's an educational if idiosyncratic package.  Clark provides straightforward analysis in many cases, like contrasting a pair of contemporaneous masters, or drawing a connection between a technical aspect of painting from different eras.  And he does have a sense of humor: one pair of paintings shows a little girl peering around a corner into a landscape from the following century.<br />This book is good for casual dipping, for instant erudition, and will spark interest in further study of the paintings--and further respect for Kenneth Clark.	2003-06-05

Become a stringer.  That is, jump-shoot his resume into the newsroom trashcan, and book passage to Cairo.  And here his story begins...<br />This jaunt through the Arab world wasn't particularly newsworthy, but the dispatches do make interesting travel reading.  He records stories of native family life, dissipated expatriates, sleek young westernized Arabs, and so forth.  He bumps his consciousness painfully against the intractable Arab/Israeli conflict, and goes for an all-night boatride with Indian smugglers out of Dubai.  There's a wrenching visit to wretched south Sudanese refugees, and to the no less wretched capital of their oppressors, Khartoum.  And he spotlights some scummy colleagues, photojournalists bouncing along in a jeep on a battlefield of the Iran-Iraq war, complaining about the lack of photogenic carnage.<br />The book ends during Desert Shield, which is a shame, but he had to wind it up somewhere, I suppose.  All he can do is end on a hopeful note, hoping that Iraq's liberation will not be far off.<br />Footnote:  Horwitz makes a cameo appearance in the late Michael Kelly's book about Desert Storm, _Martyr's Day_.	2003-05-22

It is, as Kelly states in the forward, an impressionistic account of his experiences during the run-up to the war, the hostilities themselves, and the aftermath.  With politics and military science largely excluded, it all adds up to a superior piece of travel writing.<br />Kelly had a great eye for scene-setting, for the telling anecdote, the incongruous detail, and the contrasting pair of viewpoints.  Also for the pithy description:  he describes a gorgeous couple he met in an elevator in Israel thus: &quot;She looked like Darryl Hannah, and he looked like money and tennis.&quot;<br />The people's tales he tells are sometimes funny, and sometimes haunting.  The funny ones often involved himself, as when he records himself gaping across a restaurant in Baghdad for a glimpse of the TV news.  No one else shows any interest, and it dawns on him that it's because the Iraqi TV newscast is just a series of Saddam's Great Leader proclamations, boringly familiar to everyone.  Some scenes are funny and haunting, as in one where a British TV crew is filming an interview with a Kuwaiti man who is describing his torture ordeal at the hands of the Iraqis.  The tearful man is repeatedly interrupted by the blas&eacute; producer, to amend some technical difficulty or other.<br />It's a fine wartime travelogue, and it is a great pity that there won't be any more such from Michael Kelly.	2003-05-21

Liberals howled, but they can no longer shout down criticism of affirmative action with accusations of &quot;racism.&quot;<br />D'Souza also gave higher education the sunray treatment, with _Illiberal Education_, which in its turn drew as many squawks as a firecracker in a chicken coop.  With that book he proved that the question &quot;When is a racial quota not a racial quota?&quot; has no non-nonsensical answer.<br />So he's entitled to sit back and preen a little, and take a curtain call.  But this book feels like it was composed on cocktail napkins during slow moments on airline flights.  It's little more than a sheaf of his talking points, &quot;war&quot; stories from his lectures, and assorted zingers, done up as letters to a young conservative.<br />Even that would be okay, if he didn't make lazy errors of fact.  For example, in one bit on the Soviet Union, he poo-poos the idea that any empire could dismantle itself solely for economical reasons-apparently forgetting that the British Empire did exactly that.<br />The book is a throwaway, and D'Souza probably knows it.  It could have been a small gem, with a little more work.	2003-05-20

It's a wonder that anything worthwhile about nations and their people ever gets written anymore.<br />So the existence of this overlooked gem is a boon to anyone unraveling the Gordian complexities of French national character.  Rosenblum takes us through history and around the globe, from Gaul to the mid-Eighties, and from Paris to La France Profonde to her old colonies-turned-proteges to France's furthest island outposts.<br />With delightfully wry turns of phrase-English and French-he admires and skewers the genuine greatness and the overbearing pomposity of the French.  (Of particular current interest are the doings of the then-Foreign Minister:  Jacques Chirac.)  He interviewed seemingly hundreds of people, relates many amusing and thought-provoking anecdotes, and generalizes aptly and fairly.<br />Here are a few excerpts:<br />&quot;A string of crumbling French crusader forts rises from high ground across the Levant.  They protect nothing and represent little power, but they are still there, after eight centuries.  Like France. In North Africa, the French loom large, balanced precariously at center stage.  But in the Middle East, they are nowhere and everywhere, moving within a hall of mirrors that only the architects of Versailles could have fashioned.&quot;<br />&quot;The oldest [colonial] buildings show graceful, almost delicate facades; but gates are high, carved doors are solid as iron, stone walls are massive.  They were designed to stay cool under the sun, remind civil servants of home, impress the locals, and withstand the odd volley of paving stones should things turn nasty.  Not surprisingly, the cathedral and the university were built to last.<br /> The British, in their outposts, leaned toward wood-frame<br />buildings and corrugated tin, as if they did not want the overhead to cut into profits.

Boy grows up in the hinterland, discovers that he has received the divine ray of talent, follows his dreams and scrabbles for decades, then finally hits the big time in Hollywood.<br />The difference is that Harrison never lost touch with the land, much preferring to repair to his favorite hunting and fishing spots, and drink with the locals back home in Michigan, rather than toil away in the studios.  Oh, he did lose his church unbringing, and G. K. Chesterton would surely call Harrison's idea of a private religion mere weakmindedness, but Harrison has undoubtedly consumed an adult portion of life, and he's here to tell us all about it.<br />As a biographical account of his life and career, this is much too misty.  The reader must swim open seas of random impressions, interesting anecdotes, and barstool wisdom to get from one fact to the next.  And they are not especially sequential, either.  I guess that job will have to wait for a professional biographer.<br />But taken for what it is, this book is enjoyable.  There's too much name-dropping in the Hollywood phase, though he is sincerely grateful to Jack Nicholson for his help breaking into pictures.  But really--eating sandwiches with Art Garfunkel while betting on which skiers on a slope are going to wipe out?  And there are dozens such little passing mentions.  Maybe I'm just jealous...<br />His love of the land, of the countryside, of his hunting dogs, and his unsparing accounts of his own shortcomings and addictions and mistakes make this book one to respect.  It may be a mishmash, it may not be the whole or unadulterated truth, but it is visibly a labor of love.	2003-05-07

Swofford was an intelligent, bookreading Marine, unlike so many of the simple fighters around him.  By his own account, he hated what the Corps made him, yet admits that his post-service life entailed in part a slippage from the keen edge the Corps honed him to.<br />The narrative flow is all chopped up into flash-forwards, flash-backs, and whatnot.  This is completely unnecessary, as Swofford's story is compelling enough to be told straight.  Maybe the editors insisted on shuffling the story, in order to keep the attention of video-impaired Gen-X readers.<br />Memoirs by bitter ex-soldiers are nothing new, not even in America.  What makes this more than a big Bronx cheer at the military is Swofford's evident intelligence and powers of observation--sniper skills that just happened to translate into book-writing talent.  A Marine who reads Nietzsche in a bar and The Iliad in the desert?  We're lucky he survived.  And the fact that he thinks the war was all a put-up job, all about oil, is no barrier to granting him a hearing.  (I doubt that he runs everywhere in his home town of Portland.)<br />Since the book is a jumble of vignettes, it's no sin to pick out the best ones.  Years after being discharged, he goes on a bender with a former comrade.  They drink and run and sing cadence and slap each other around, drunkenly angry at each other \\"for changing, for slipping\\".  He gets into an argument with some German tourists about Desert Storm not being a \\"real\\" war.  He answers that the significance of the war won't be known for years, and that he underwent hardship, uglines, and terror and saw death, just like every other frontline soldier in any war.  He idly threatens a comrade with death, at sadistic length, for getting Swofford in trouble.  In the war itself, he happens onto a bombed out Iraqi encampment, and joins the dead Iraqi soldiers around their campfire for a few moments, soaking in the ghastly impressions.<br />The actual battle scenes are very brief and seemingly inconsequential--if you're only reading about it.  Swofford indeed knew the terror of war, but his war was over so quickly that he never underwent the numbing acclimation to the terror, reported by soldier-memoirists in other wars.  He never even fired his weapon in combat, his only chance being spiked by glory-hound commanders, he says.<br />This is a good book to read together with another memoir by another Marine from another war: E. B. Sledge's _With the Old Breed_, about a Marine rifleman's war on Peleliu and Okinawa.  The similarities and contrasts between these two remarkable men are as thought-provoking as their books are separately.<br />Swofford deserves thanks for his service, and for his sacrifice--because losing faith is a sacrifice.hastly impressions.<br />The actual battle scenes are very brief and seemingly inconsequential--if you're only reading about it.

Over the years Pipes has fearlessly documented and theorized about the rise of militant Islam, or Islamicism, as it is sometimes rather confusingly called.<br />Pipes kicks off by asserting that Islam itself is not a danger, only the militant, aggrieved strain of it.  But, most every Islamic organization and activist treated in the book turns out to be militant and aggrieved, so one does have to be careful to try to keep perspective.<br />The chapters are individual essays, written over a number of years, with linking material composed for this book.  With the exception of a chapter on the homegrown Nation of Islam, the pieces focus on Arab Islamicists.  We get examples of how American Muslim organizations wield considerable clout, successfully playing the victimology fiddle despite being almost totally spared anything that could plausibly be called oppression.  We also see how simple criminals from Lebanon are turned to the service of Islamic terrorism, and how chary American media are of giving offense by reporting anything negative about American Muslims as a group.<br />It turns out that some Muslims charities fund terrorism, and this is because Islam's understanding of charity is significantly different from the West's.  Charity, or _zakat_, means helping the poor, helping travelers, funding bureaucracies to administer the largesse, but also to \\"change hearts\\", which is bribery, and \\"the service of Allah\\", which is jihad.  So it is not inconsistent for a Muslim charity to send money to Hamas or Hezbollah or Islamic Jihad, should it find their calls to holy war authoritative.<br />Pipes has been criticized for writing outside his specialty, which is medieval Islam.  But he convincingly counters that the contemporary field has been paralyzed by Edward Said's influential denunciation of \\"Orientalism\\".  Pipes maintains that current scholarship is dominated by Western scholars who have been intimidated into abandoning skepticism, or are Middle Eastern immigrants who are busily spinning perceptions of their faith and homelands.<br />When professors get arrested for fomenting and funding terrorism but remain posters boys for academic freedom, when an emotionally conflicted American Muslim soldier commits battlefield fratricide and his motives are dismissed as \\"attitude problems\\", when 3,000 Americans are murdered live on TV, and political correctness forbids discussing the enemy outside the leftist trinity of race, sex, and class, then you know we haven't taken scholars like Daniel Pipes seriously enough.

It is an invaluable account of his pastoral career, in the Thirties, under the Nazis and Soviets, through his role in winning the Cold War and on into the Nineties.<br />Throughout, the pope is portrayed as being steadfast in his insistence on human dignity.  He masterfully turned an international conference on family planning from a focus on quasi-eugenics to a focus on the importance of strong, committed families.  That is, his vision of people as minds and souls triumphed in that instance over the secular vision of people as mere stomachs and mouths.<br />The research here is meticulous and seemingly exhaustive.  One long footnote traces the troubled publishing history of one commentator's interpretation of one of  Wojtyla's pre-papal philosophical tracts.<br />Some encyclicals were more successful than others.  Sollicitudo Rei Socialis could have been seen as an indictment of Marxist despotisms around the world, but it was instead slammed in America for its seeming moral equivalence between socialism and capitalism.<br />He wasn't welcomed everywhere: indeed, he deserves credit for venturing into traditionally anti-Catholic countries like the Netherlands.  The Sandinistas in Nicaragua tried to sabotage his Mass there, but he made a visual connection with the people anyway.  And his receptions in his first two trips back to Poland were little short of rapturous.<br />Weigel's accounts of John Paul's first couple of visits to Poland after his investure as Pope are just plain thrilling.  These pilgrimages and the confrontations with Poland's communist masters are arguably the dramatic high point of his pontificate.  Fortune rarely sees anyone to the door, as the quotation goes, but this pontiff has fulfilled so many hopes, and served so honorably for so long, that he deserved the proposed sobriquet of \\"the Great\\".  Weigel's encyclopedic account of his life and reign is solid proof of that, and is unlikely to be superceded anytime soon.eign is solid proof of that, and is unlikely to be superceded anytime soon.	2003-03-25

This is journalism; not parachute journalism, but not scholarship either, Friedman is a seasoned observer of the Middle Eastern scene, having written a bestseller about the region, From Beirut to Jerusalem.<br />Friedman opens with a column denouncing the legitimacy of the Bush presidency, and then asking his readers to grant it legitimacy anyway.  With this potshot out of the way, he thereafter treats the Bush administrations handling of the war fairly enough.  Theres a bit more liberal linkage than I personally care for (if liberal hobbyhorse X is slighted, then the terrorists will have won!).  He deplores the U.S.s failure to ratify the Kyoto treaty, seeming to take its provisions and the good faith of its signatories entirely at face value.  Plus, he sounds shocked, utterly and repeatedly, at the actions of the Palestinian suicide brigades, while simultaneously demanding that Israel make yet more concessions to them.  Dont they know they are endangering the peace process?!  Well, thats the crude calculus at work in a jihad.  But on the whole his observations are fair and his questions incisive.<br />In one column, an Egyptian journalist asks him to describe the impact of the WTCs destruction.  Friedman replies that it is as if the Pyramids had been destroyed, along with thousands of people inside.  Therein he unknowingly brushes against one of the features of Americas islamofascist enemy.  The most radical of the muslim fundamentalists, arab or otherwise, have no respect for pagan antiquities.  The ruins are merely of instructional value, to show what befalls those who reject the One True Faith.  I read one book in which one such person wished to destroy the ancient Egyptian heritage, and Allah would provide to make up for the lost tourism revenues.

The quality of the individual flicks ranged from near-schlock to iconic, but the Bond style always set them apart.  This coffee-table book digs deep into the history of the series, from Ian Fleming's books down to the most recent Pierce Brosnan vehicle.  And the authors gathered comments from practically everybody, from the stars to the producers right down to the guy who wrote the famous James Bond guitar riff.  An enjoyable look into the past, through the barrel of the Walther PPK.	2003-02-10

Its not easy to convert good columns into a good book.  Hanson wisely packages these essays as being of a specific place and time, rather than trying to conflate and inflate them into a single piece of bigthink.<br />The pieces have aged well.  Hanson is full of praise for our military, and full of threats for our enemies.  The news media emphasized our mistakes, but the American military and diplomatic achievement in Afghanistan was remarkable.  What the lumbering Soviet army couldnt do in eight years, a few units of American sea, air and air-mobile forces did in three months.  With plenty of help from local friendlies, which the Sovs also didnt have much luck keeping.<br />His historical satires, in which he mocks the hypothetical responses of contemporary liberals to great moments of decision in our past, are savagely funny.  The high-handed dim-wittedness that he puts in the mouths of Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings in response to the Doolittle Raid are laugh-out-loud hilarious, depending on your POV.<br />Hanson has also read his Bernard Lewis and Samuel Huntington, and incisively details the now-familiar reasons that Islamic lands are so backward and resentful of the West.  Its a lesson that cant be learned too thoroughly, especially when so many other voices insist upon their negative faith in America the Bad.  Consensual, secular self-government is unglamorous, but is still a rare gift from history.<br />He makes many appeals to our own martial past, as well as the deeper, wider Western past, invoking Lepanto, Thermopylae, and Marathon in addition to Pearl Harbor and Okinawa.  He execrates the American Left hot and strong, and deservedly so.  In contrast to the amoral, irony-crippled, ideology-addled elites, he posits a sturdy, plucky yeomanry, good and true and brave and morally unblinkered.  This is more problematic, as I didnt find it very hard to find ordinary working folks who wanted no part of the war, and who also thought the Israelis were getting what they deserved in the wave of suicide bombings.  But it was indeed instructive to see the psychic indigestion *some* people got from viewing all those American flags flying everywhere that autumn.<br />Toward the end, his columns drift into speculation about what to do about Iraqs weapons of mass destruction program.  The sitzkrieg that developed after the conclusion of the Afghanistan war seemed to give the lie to the urgency of that problem, though the reasons Hanson advanced were still current among proponents of military action to remove Saddam.  So this is that journalistic rarity, a collection of columns that is of lasting value.  Inspiring.brave and morally unblinkered.

In public the American bishops flogged their assumed moral acuity:  intoning sonorous condemnations of Ronald Reagan's policies, loudly wondering if the pontiff knew what century it was, while in private they inducted and sheltered priests who preyed upon unsuspecting parishioners' teenaged boys.  This book is an account of how it happened, and how the stinking mess was exposed.<br />George Weigel must certainly have written this book with a very personal anger at the malfeasant clerics who allowed all this to happen.  He had written a well-received biography of the current pontiff, who is one of the 20th century's indisputable heroes.  Now, the post-Cold War victory glow of the Catholic church has been dispelled by the reek of the American church's sexual scandals.  Weigel manfully refrains from calling the crisis a media creation, though he does score the press on a few inaccuracies here and there.  He sticks to just the facts: the opinions of even the most influential commentators like Andrew Sullivan and Richard John Neuhaus are excluded.  He also does not waste a lot of space replying to charges that the church's rule of celibacy caused these predators to seduce their young male victims.  Nor does he dwell on the capture of the American Catholic seminaries by the gay subculture-Michael Rose's Goodbye, Good Men is the place to get an full, infuriating examination of that sad state of affairs.<br />Weigel provides a chronological narrative of the crisis, and by the way an explanation of the functions of various papal officers and departments.  He traces the origins of the crisis to what he calls the \\"Truce of 1968\\", in which American liberals in the church flouted elements of Vatican II, and were allowed to get away with it.  These people then established a \\"culture of dissent\\" in the seminaries, turning away orthodox applicants, and spreading laxness and relativism and corruption throughout the American church.<br />The Vatican also bungled its end of responsibility.  It did not keep the Pope and his aides adequately informed, nor did it conduct crucial press conferences very competently.<br />Weigel insists against some American reformers that this is a crisis of fidelity, not of management or oversight.  He reiterates the theological inspiration for the offices of priests, bishops and cardinals, and proposes many sharp, specific reforms.  He calls for nothing less than the spiritual cauterization of the American Church.<br />The Americans were not completely corrupt.  The U. S. church had in fact discreetly resolved many of the abuses, under prompting by Rome, by the time the story broke.  But what goes on in the dark comes out in the light.<br />The crisis continued to rage after this book's publication.  Cardinal Bernard Law was forced to resign some months later, and reformers threatened the outright ban on homosexuals in the priesthood.  One gets the sense that things will get uglier before they get prettier.  But no one can doubt that thoroughgoing penance and reform must come before any renewal in the American Catholic church.  Let the cleaning of the whited sepulchers begin.spreading laxness and relativism and corruption throughout the American church.  <br />The Vatican also bungled its end of responsibility.

Of these last Mick Jagger appears the most frequently, evolving from A Portrait Of A Famous Person Taken By David Bailey to the most notorious man in show business by the end of the decade.  A close second is fading golden boy Brian Jones.  Among the more conventional celebs are Terence Stamp, Michael Caine, and Peter Sellers.  Stamp is so young and unformed here that it is hard to recognize him at first; Caine is reduced to a pipe &amp; black frame glasses Everyman; and Sellers' portrait looks like a Roman bust.<br />Documentary pictures of potato-nosed East Enders, including plenty of studio portraits of crime bosses the Kray brothers.  Bailey won their respect for having come from the East End himself and achieving success.  But, one photo shows the Kray twins with Bailey sitting in between, visibly hoping not to get bumped off.<br />Lots of images of the original super-model, Jean Shrimpton, mostly from Vogue layouts but also plenty from other photo dates as well.  There is also a generous helping of photographs of model Penelope Tree, whose face Bailey aptly described as &quot;an Egyptian Jiminy Cricket.&quot;  We also see lots of other perfectly turned out Vogue models.<br />There are some exotic shots of Nepal and some snaps from his military service in Singapore, but the focus is in the main on early Sixties London.  Though the book is not arranged chronologically, one can see his technical development, as he incorporates other photographers' ideas like askew framing, daylight flash, and tent lighting.  There is a color section, but gorgeously inky b/w is the star here.  Many of the subjects have been shorn of the celebrity that no doubt added to their portraits' impact, but that's no barrier to enjoying this big collection..	2002-12-26

A child loses his teddy; it is found by a park derelict; who meets and becomes friends with the boy despite the obvious discomfort of the boy's parents.  BZZZTTT!!!  David McPhail picked the wrong year to write a book about warm, fuzzy homeless people.  Why didn't he make the other character a poor child, or a lonely soldier on station far from home, or something like that?  In this year of appalling, highly-publicized child abductions, the lesson couldn't be any clearer: children should be instructed to view street people as dangerous until proven otherwise.  If McPhail wants to join the ranks of those who make mascots of these people, that's his business.  But it is the height of irresponsibility to teach unsuspecting children to do the same.	2002-12-14

That book compiled quotations about Shakespeare and his works in literature from 1591 to 1700.  _After Shakespeare_ also reaches back into Shakespeare's era, and is arranged differently, but it still makes a good bookend for the earlier book.<br />The book is arranged into chapters of quotations about Shakespeare himself, his plays, his poetry, his influence in foreign lands, his appearance in novels, plays, movies, and adaptations of his works.  There is considerable overlap, as many of these divisions are quite subjective.  And the collection isn't all quips; there are lengthy excerpts of plays, novels, and essays.  The quotes that appeal to me are the pithiest ones, however.  King George III is recorded in a courtier's diary as complaining how rubbishy much of Shakespeare is, though one musn't say so.  William Hazlitt contrasts the greatness of the Bard's work with the teeming insignificance of the critical writings that sprung up about him.  Georg Christoph Lichtenberg marvels at how Shakespeare uses remarkable turns of phrase, which other writers would highlight, as throwaway lines.<br />But there's doubtless treasure in every chapter here for any Shakespeare lover.  A fine, fun collection by a great, erudite anthologist.	2002-12-05

One might think so, as this is very similar in layout and heft to the Beatles' _Anthology_.  But the truth is that the Rolling Stones richly deserve a coffee table treatment like this--which isn't even the first such one.  After the Beatles broke up, the Stones broke out, and never worried about trying to be the anti-Beatles ever again.  The story ex-Stone Bill Wyman tells here fully justifies the oversized treatment.  And it only goes up to his departure from the band, in 1993!<br />His own personal life is mentioned here and there.  First wife Diane Cory is a good woman but not the stuff rock star wives are made of.  Marrying teenager Mandy quickly turns out to have been a big mistake.  He finally finds domestic happiness in the Nineties, with Suzanne Acosta and the three daughters they have.<br />The layout is chronological, with tour dates, set lists, album tracks, and etc.  Along the way are a lot of musical memories: seeing Hendrix as that phenomenal performer first exploded onto the London scene, having Lennon and McCartney pen a single for the Stones early in their career, T-Rex guitarist Mark Bolan kissing Mick on the mouth.  And there are all the familiar tales of the band's rise to success to excess to the very top of the rock firmament.  The book is sprinkled with fun quotes, too, like this one from artist Peter Blake in 1963: &quot;By the year 2000, the Rolling Stones will seem to have been as cuddly as teddy bears.&quot;  It's a lot of fun to read this account by the quiet Stone, about the band that will Not Fade Away.	2002-12-03

Journalists from all levels of the profession who were on the story are interviewed. Their tales are then spliced up and laid out in chronological order, from onset to post-traumatic jitters. The professionalism on display here is absolutely superb. Most people have some idea of how hectic the job of getting the news produced each day is. Here we have the spectacle of these brave professionals getting the job done minus most of their familiar tools and surroundings, and plus a soul-sucking fear that they or their colleagues are about to die. No smirks, no condescension, no \\"women and minorities hardest hit\\" credentializing.<br /> So is this book an adequate tribute to them? Yes. Can't go wrong. The text is punchy and hot-off-the-presses, and the photos really crackle. There is a problem, though.<br />The book seems to discriminate against Foxnews. Apart from a screenshot of Shepard Smith and a photo of a correspondent at the Pentagon, Foxnews is excluded from this collection. This is very strange, since Foxnews is based in New York and is the number four American news network, behind the networks and ahead of CNN. Could it be that the Newseum staff who edited this book don't consider those eeeevillll conservatives to be *real* journalists? That's a nasty thought, but what other explanation could there be? Even a reporter from the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, in town for a fashion show and caught up in events, is quoted multiple times. To be sure, staff from the Wall Street Journal are quoted extensively, as their offices were hardest hit.<br />Apart from that, the book is gripping. The journos' professional instincts snapped into action. Taking to bicycling when traffic congeals, giving the cordon police the slip, phoning Mom to relay a report second hand, the ingenuity and dedication is impressive. There's also a seldom-reported sensitivity. Some reporters pitch in with relief efforts. Some cry along with the sobbing victims they are interviewing. There's only one case of a reporter getting the bum's rush, from some firemen who were trying to catch their breath.<br /> We get all meat in this book. The actual TV broadcasts that day were teeming with hastily miked-up guests experts, helping the gabbling anchors fill air time until actual news got into their earpieces. But ever the pro, Peter Jennings signaled for silence on the set when the towers came down. No comment was necessary.<br />It might have been nice to include a story or two from a West Coast news outlet. When the attacks happened, I couldn't get into any of the national news websites. I finally connected to the Sacramento Bee's site. The webmaster was frantically posting up wire photos and rolling copy through, with what must have been a small, sleepy crew.<br />And then in a few weeks things were back to normal. NPR's Loren Jenkins blurted in an interview that he would \\"smoke out\\" and disclose the location of any U. S. troops on a secret mission, if it meant getting the story. The TV news people harrumphed at Fox for wearing lapel flags, fearing that the sight of the national flag on the set would signify support for the Bush administration and not the country as a whole. Reuters insisted on calling Arab terrorists \\"militants\\", and putting \\"terrorism\\" in skepticism-implying quotation marks. The liberal pundits covered the Afghan war like children in the back seat whining \\"Are we there yet?\\" New York Times editorial page editor Howell Raines concluded that the war on terror was Vietnam II, and used his page of that august newspaper to try to block further retaliation.

Has any cultural pendulum ever swung so fast?  Where did all these people explode onto the scene from?  Models, photographers, hair dressers, boutique owners, managers of mayfly-lifespanned clubs, clothing designers, decadent aristos slumming around, East End yobbos coming up in the world of film, pop stars becoming huger than huge icons of an age.  I always think of the Sixties as the decade that the world shifted from black-and-white to color.  But fashion photographer and Swinging London plankholder David Bailey said that for him, it was when the world shifted from grey to black-and-white, and maybe he's got a point, for the beginning of the era.  The English went from the Angry Young Men in the Fifties chafing against the English class system to a pop cultural sunburst in the Sixties in which class simply ceased to matter-for a while.<br />Apparently it all began in the gay sub-culture, when some fashion designers started imitating their camp \\"clobber.\\" Or maybe it exfoliated from all the Italian fashions flooding London in the Fifties.  Or maybe young French students clubbing in London on holiday in the early Sixties brought some fashion ideas.  Or maybe all these seeds mutated together and germinated under a steady pollination by American rock 'n' roll.  (Whatever, the British did for American pop culture what the Japanese would later do for the American automobile industry: nearly steal it.)  One dress designer says that the postwar children were malnourished in the Forties, and they grew up to be beautiful, skinny clotheshorses in the Sixties.  And Terence Stamp tells how he went to purchase \\"Love Me Do\\" and was surprised to learn that the singers were English.  But the ray of inspiration passed from Rome and America to London, and soon Britannia was waiving the rules, and epitomizing youth, freshness, inventiveness, decadence and possibility all at once.<br />And then it all came back down to earth, in a heap.  The familiar and to Americans not so familiar deaths, the rise of hippie anti-fashion, and the mass marketing of even that, the psychoactive drugs and the ruin they wreaked in the lives of so many talented people, are all numbered off and duly deplored.  The inevitable Syd Barrett pops up almost as the book's coda.  The Sixties were dead, and they didn't leave a particularly beautiful corpse.  But out of the ashes...<br />One can always carp about this or that bit of music history being left out, doubtless for space reasons.  Sure, Jimi Hendrix ushered in a whole new musical era in London, and raised the bar considerably for the English guitar heroes of the time.  But Cream had already served notice that the electric guitar was not just a jangly noisemaker, and that rock was starting to have an artistic claim to serious critical attention.  This more than anything was a British achievement, however far Hendrix and the prog-rockers of the Seventies ran with it.  Or you can read about how Keith Richards stayed out of the making of the movie _Performance_, sullen because of Mick's love scenes with Keith's girlfriend Anita Pallenberg.  It might have been interesting to note that Ry Cooder did the guitar work on _Performance_ when Keef grumped out-for which service Richards plagiarized many of his best riffs for Stones songs.<br />The menacing East End crime kings the Kray brothers pop up throughout the book.  They were also wannabe scenesters, but were just a few crucial years behind the times.  One unremarked-upon irony is that the Krays were the subject of a movie decades on.  Their parts were played by members of Spandau Ballet, the fashion-heavy New Romantic Eighties band.<br />We also get quick run-throughs of the familiar Beatles and Rolling Stones stories, as they pertain to London at that time.  John Lennon is a nasty git in this book, and Mick Jagger is his familiar amoral self.  Indeed, it may be startling to younger readers to read the accounts of his ruthless usage of people early in his life and career.<br />An annoyance is that the text describes classic, epochal photos in many places, but most of them are not included in the book.  It seems like Doubleday could have gotten the permissions if they had tried.  No key to the photos on the back cover, either.<br />Okay, so this book is drawn from other memoirs, other interviews, other studies.  What of it?  Fifty years from now all books about the Sixties will be written thus.  With its pan-and-zoom-in, pan-and-zoom-in structure, _Ready Steady Go_ is as intimate-but safe-a journey through that time and place as it may be possible to take.y be startling to younger readers to read the accounts of his ruthless usage of people early in his life and career.  <br />An annoyance is that the text describes classic, epochal photos in many places, but most of them are not included in the book.

I've added one star for the benefit of modern poetry lovers, who will no doubt see more in this collection than I did.<br />In the introduction to this slender collection of poems, the editors plump the persistence of poetry. Immediately after the Towers came down, poems appeared everywhere. Nailed on poles, taped in windows, scrawled in dust, poetry answered a need of expression that other forms could not. In their extremity people just let their feelings pour out in verse.<br />Unfortunately, all the poems collected here are by professional poets. I daresay that nobody reads contemporary poetry except other poets, so this collection betrays a pretty self-absorbed mood. As the editors proudly note in the forward, few of the poems make any direct reference to the atrocity, and only two mention retaliation, and that in a negative way. Instead, these curdled by irony bards spin blank, meterless lines of...whatever comes to mind, apparently.<br />Poetry as therapy seems the dominant theme. The closest to a recognizably human sentiment anyone comes up with is one poem ticking off all the missing street vendors. Others just muse upon their mute shock, using descriptions of bric-a-brac in their apartments for grace notes or codas. Still others focus on a single incongruous detail out of the surrounding calamity, funny how some things catch your attention. One guy goes cruising in the gay Chelsea district, an imaginary Walt Whitman on his arm, while decrying all ickiness in life. Another types up a passable Guardian editorial, blaming America, but we know it's poetry because of all the indentations. And there's an alphabet of alliterations in another.<br />Okay, poets are people too, and must have their own ways of dealing with disaster. Other poets reading this will no doubt nod in sage recognition of many of these images and moods. No one expects the War on Terror to have a Rudyard Kipling or a Rupert Brooke, or for that matter a Civil War-era Walt Whitman.  But it does seem to me that the plainest, most heartfelt poems of 9/11 must have been washed down the drain along with the ash they were written on.seem to me that the plainest, most heartfelt poems of 9/11 must have been washed down the drain along with the ash they were written on.	2002-11-09

It is not an autobiography but more a collection of pub performances in written form.  Which is no handicap to enjoying the collection: conversation remained an art in England long after it became extinct in America.<br />Some of the people profiled are not friends or enemies, but neglected writers whose stars Amis hoped to revive.  The writer Elizabeth Taylor is one of these.  Others, like Anthony Burgess and Enoch Powell, are simply famous people who were barely acquaintances, but with whom Amis had notable run-ins.<br />The profiles of his literary friends are mostly strings of amusing faux pas or escapades, usually drunken.  He sportingly lingers over his own social pratfalls as much as over others'.  Or maybe fair play has nothing to do with it; he just recognizes good material no matter who the subject is.  In his own telling, he spends much of these events half in the bag, to the point of being unable to reconstruct them from memory later.  Except for a passing opinion or two, he stays away from politics and literary theories, even giving Robert Conquest's limericks more ink than his Sovietology.  He sticks to the same approach even with his nearest and dearest: his wives and novelist son only appear as part of some anecdote or other.<br />His view of America is like Frances Trollope's.  Gleeful japes at the Ugly American abound, each more devastating than the last.  Well, H. L. Mencken did it earlier and better.  And no charge for saving England's bacon so many times, old top.<br />Here and there genuine affection for his closest friends bubbles to the surface.  Philip Larkin appears throughout the collection, in addition to his own chapter, and Amis frequently quotes from Larkin's uncollected poetry.  Under Amis' treatment, the mopey old onanist almost becomes a tragic figure.  Other people like post-conversion Malcolm Muggeridge make no sense to him, as Amis does not have or at least does not display any spiritual side.<br />Taken altogether, this is a very English, sometimes acidly English, survey of one writer's circle of acquaintances, but not much of their era.have or at least does not display any spiritual side.<br />Taken altogether, this is a very English, sometimes acidly English, survey of one writer's circle of acquaintances, but not much of their era.	2002-10-07

He tells of his rescue of civilians (some unwilling) that day, the mind-crushing horror of the collapse, and his rescue of his fellow survivors out of the debris field. Co-writer Daniel Paisner visibly smooths the New Yorkisms out of Chief Pitch's story: one can almost see the deleted \\"am I right?\\" and fuhgeddaboudits in this brave blue collar man's tale. Picciotto levels criticism at pinch-penny administrators here and there, but never whines. A great personal account deserving its share of the mountain of plaudits the FDNY has received since 9-11.	2002-10-07

What a waste of valuable stoutheartedness the story of the Afrikaners is!  These incredibly tough pioneers carved a stern Calvinist home for themselves out of native territories and raw bush, survived defeat at the hands of the British Empire at its peak, and hung on to their atavistic racial creed decades after it was abandoned elsewhere in the anglosphere.<br />In retrospect, the idea of a pluralistic democracy in Zimbabwe was foredoomed, given Africans' historic loyalty to their own tribes.  The only example of democracy they saw firsthand was the Anglo-Afrikaner model, which had done them few favors in 350 years.  And yet, majority rule swiftly became even worse.  One watches current events in the new South Africa with apprehension, fearing a replay of Zimbabwe's slide into post-apartheid chaos.<br />Boynton honestly sets down his trepidation as lawlessness overtook former police state.  He later details the corruption that the new government engaged in, and the reeling in of the press.  Could things have possibly come out right?<br />South Africa and Rhodesia certainly had their chances.  Boynton describes his love of his African home, his activist youth which ended with him being smuggled out of Rhodesia, evading arrest, and his homesickness during his exile.  He also includes some vignettes about dissenters who were not so fortunate, low class Afrikaner desperadoes, and the fight against poachers on southern Africa's big game preserves.  He closes with the quixotic incursion of some diehard Boer irregulars into a neighboring black homeland, in which three were killed.  Thankfully, he doesn't try to sum up What It All Means, instead letting the spectacle speak for itself.  Whether South Africa can truly become the multi-party democracy everyone hopes for, or if it will become a tribalism-driven dictatorship, is unknowable.  But what a long strange trip it's been...	2002-10-02

This mid-90s collection of humorous essays concerning the Los Angeles 'burbs is holding up well a half-decade on.  Our narrator is outwardly an exotic: a biracial performance artist, but underneath the multiculti veneer the material is familiar stuff.  For non-Angelenos it helps to have a map handy, as southern California regional humor involves quite a lot of dropping of place names.  And you still won't quite get it when some township or other is used as a punchline.<br />The book gets off to a wobbly start, with some generational generalizing that was out of date before the original newspaper column got to the recycling center.  But soon Ms. Loh turns to her career and personal life, and we are in familiar Fran Leibowitz territory.  She jokes about her (comparatively) slovenly home life, dates from hell, brain-gnawing jobs, and such.  Plenty of sharp observational humor keeps things hopping, and the whole thing is a good two-evening read.	2002-09-29

Martin Amis heard his friend Christopher Hitchens giving a speech, and drawing a laugh with an ironic use of the word comrades.  Amis apparently then set to educating himself about the original comrades in Russia, reading up on Stalin and Soviet communism.  The enormity of that person and those events affected him profoundly, jogging his creative powers.  This book is the product.<br />The book is part pr&eacute;cis, part meditation on the Stalin years.  Amis quotes liberally from his stack of Solzhenitsyn, Nabokov and Conquest, and adds some caustic reactions of his own.  The reader feels the numbing horror of Soviet communism anew in his telling.  The book resembles to an extent Robert Conquests Stalin: Breaker of Nations, as a meditation on a historical figure.  Unlike many other historians who viewed Stalin as a betrayer of the Revolution, Conquest viewed the Revolution as a betrayal of humanity.  Amis adopts this tone, and sprinkles some literary devices throughout (Zachto?  Why?, negative perfection,  and the place of laughter as a reaction to Bolshevism).  He brackets the book with some barely relevant reflections about his friends and his fathers own radical youths, his daughter, and the death of his sister.  And the point is?<br />I know how he feels, to an extent.  I was appalled by my reading of Solzhenitsyn and Conquest, too, and wanted to corner friends and tell them about these things.  And many of the critics who have slammed him for his tardy absorption of Stalinism would not have had similar reactions to the appearance of another exploration of Nazism, or South African apartheid.  But Amis is simply too late for what he seems to want to accomplish.  Stalin is safely dead and widely execrated; The Soviet Union is gone; Communism has (largely) retreated from its positions in the worlds of free governments and higher intellect; the famous Western dupes have long since been discredited; and Amis father Kingsley dropped his illusions well before his death.  All he can really do is call out friend and lefty columnist Christopher Hitchens, who is certainly wrong to cling to Lenin and Trotsky, but who is hardly the greatest misleader of public opinion of the 20th century.  In that chapter Amis is just coming down to the battlefield and finishing off the wounded.  (Search for Hitchens we were just trying to make a better world response elsewhere on the web)<br />About a quarter of this book should have been confined to a personal journal.

It's eerie, reading quotes from bankers, politicians, and brokers from the months before the Crash, about how the market had become so modernized and shockproof that panics were now impossible.  Sounds familiar...<br />New York Times financial columnist Alexander Noyes is a primary source in this book.  It is fascinating, watching these titanic events being filtered daily through this not-stupid man's pen.  We've heard more than 70 years of second-guessing about the Crash by now, so it is interesting seeing how it was taken point-blank by analysts at the time.<br />In Maury Klein's account, the Crash is nobody's fault.  Like Stanislaw Lec once said, every snowflake in an avanlanche pleads not guilty.  Big brokers ostentatiously placed big orders, hoping to spur rallies.  Consortia of financiers struggled to maintain public confidence in the market.  President Herbert Hoover-who as a humanitarian first and failed President second was Jimmy Carter in reverse-tried to get Big Business together in a game plan to retrieve the situation.  But in a free market, there is no one pulling levers and hauling cables controlling things.  There was no one to stop the free market from going into freefall.<br />Throughout the book are amusing little vignettes, like the man who sat smiling in his broker's office throughout Black Monday.

In this slim volume of reflections on the 9-11 attacks and the domestic reactions to it, Bennett calls for purposeful anger and determined retaliation against the terrorists. It says something about our times that this is a controversial position. Yet, after a couple of generations of having school kids indoctrinated in the evils of being judgmental, it seems that sizeable amounts of our morally enervated Ritalin zombies are wholly unequipped to respond to our latest challenge.<br />Bennett spends some ink deploring the Left in this country, who immediately blamed America for the attacks. Hate like that cannot be reformed, only resisted. But his greater concern is the moral illiteracy that these people have inculcated in American schoolchildren. The kids are being taught to think about the attack as if it were just a natural disaster, nobody's fault, except for the ones who are being taught to believe that Uncle Sam wore a short skirt and asked for it.<br />The weakest section is the one on Islam. Better surveys of that religion, its warlike tendencies, and its usage-hijacking, if you prefer-by terrorists are available by authors like Daniel Pipes, Bernard Lewis, Stephen Emerson, and Ram Swarup. Bennett is at his best excoriating miseducation of American children, and the resulting moral confusion they suffer. A generation that has been taught \\"Don't hit\\", may turn out peaceful, but one that has been taught \\"Don't hit back\\" has been cruelly cheated.<br />People who can watch 3,000 fellow Americans die and respond only with \\"Yes, but...\\" deserve nothing but contempt.  This book gives it to them hot and strong.  Get it to bolster your resolve.  And watch what they're teaching your children.	2002-08-21

You know, the blocky, obfuscating style the professors deploy to make their subjects or themselves seem more profound than they really are. Examining a Jimmy Page solo note-by-note is of extremely limited interest to anyone but graduate musicology students-and has high music culture declined so much that they now have to fill their syllabi with Zeppelin's catalog? Sure, I'd rather listen to \\"Gallows Pole\\" than some atonal serialist composer, but this book is laying it on way too thick. Tedious and unrewarding.	2002-06-10

It's about time this book made it back into print! I wouldn't have understood a single day of the Persian Gulf War (II) without David Pryce-Jones' explanation of the Arab mind. When it first came out it was such an anachronism that it was widely ignored, despite the urgency of the issues it addressed. A book of ethnic psychoanalysis? In 1990, arguably the floodstage year of (multi)cultural relativism? Yet world events have hammered home the blunt fact that world cultures are not all alike but for cuisine and headgear, and that some cultures are flatly and demonstratably better than others.<br />This is a book of ethnography, not of demonology. Pryce-Jones discusses components of the Arab world-view: shame/honor, money-favoring, etc., always with the understanding that there are exceptions to everything, but that cultural patterns may still be discerned. He cites many Western scholars, but allows Arab voices plenty of scope to speak, also. Indeed, the book is a good introduction to many interesting Arab writings.<br />It is a demanding subject, even though the book is written for the educated layman, so it is slow going in spots. There is no confident sweep of history as in Bernard Lewis, nor many pungent polemics as in Daniel Pipes. Readers will find themselves skipping to chapters that are of immediate interest, but the entire book is a must-read. We can't afford to be PC--I mean, ignorant--anymore.	2002-05-03

It is a &quot;Family of Man&quot; style panorama of ordinary people's lifeways across the Muslim world.  The color quality is adequate for mid-century, and the composition of the images tends towards Millet-style peasant monumentalism, though always with a photojournalistic edge.  Especially valuable are the pictures of Saudi Arabia before the kingdom's petrobillions transformed the landscape, and of pre-communist Afghanistan's conclave of warlords.

Yes, the section on Iran has many pictures of frothing-at-the-mouth mobs surging through the streets, brandishing fists and assault rifles.  No, the rest of the book is nothing like that.  There are some ghastly pictures of war dead in the section on Kuwait, and the inevitable images of uzi-toting worshippers at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, but nothing else like the featured parts.  The book is much more sensitive and insightful than that.<br />Iran-born Magnum photographer Abbas traveled through the Islamic world, searching for manifestations of militant Islam.  (It's too bad he didn't collaborate with V. S. Naipaul in his research on the very similar subject of Islam in non--Arabic countries.)  What he came up with were images that show the unifying (or uniformity-imposing, if you prefer) power of Islam.  Everywhere he goes, he finds the same images:  Schoolchildren bobbing and chanting over their Korans, tumbledown cemeteries where the dead are honored on Fridays, funerals, women and girls in hijab going about their daily business, men lolling on carpets in mosques reading the Koran, people stopping in their tracks to perform their prayers, and etc.<br />There are also many delightful surprises:  Schoolgirls in hijab cloaks playing basketball, ballerinas in a muslim former Soviet republic, a long--haired dervish in full flight with drum and tambourine leggings, a emotional Kuwaiti woman talking with an almost as emotional female American soldier after the liberation of Kuwait City, a bearded elder walking past a clutch of Pakistani teens in Britain who radiate \\"Cool Britannia\\".<br />Some of the surprises are not delightful.  We see a Christian in Sudan being tried and then flogged in a shariah court for drinking alcohol.  A sheep in an English barbershop, cows in Indonesia, and camels in the pilgrimage places in Saudi Arabia are all sacrificed in performance of Islamic rites.  Shiite Muslims lashing and lacerating themselves in one of their ceremonies.<br />But throughout there are many images of pure photographic beauty.  Baobab trees are shown in spiky, inky silhouette above a cemetery.  Rows of white--cloaked women at prayer in Jakarta stretch beyond the border of the photo.  Young Senegalese men pose in front of a tangle of limbs and vines after an initiation ceremony.  Really gorgeous stuff, quite beyond the power of this amateur.<br />The unobtrusive text tells of Abbas' travels among these peoples.  He strikes out in the U. S. with the Nation of Islam, who quickly clam up and deny him access.  He gets along fine with the Indonesian Muslims, and even has to coax statements of discontent out of them.

The subtitle notwithstanding, it contains almost no discussion of modern terrorism.  The book's introduction acknowledges the existence of holy warriors like Osama bin Laden, and the epilogue notes the persistence of jihad by terrorism in our own day, but that's all.  The rest of it is an interesting, at times horrifying account of how the sword of Islam hacked its way into Europe, and how it was slowly beaten back.  The reader must note that Fregosi limits himself to Europe:  The jihad in India was even crueler than in Europe, but it falls outside this book's scope.  Readers wanting more information on India's sad fate under the Islamic onslaught should read Will Durant's Our Oriental Heritage.<br />Given the subject of holy war, and given this publisher, the freethinking Prometheus Press, it is surprising how mild in tone this book is.  Heads roll and blood gushes in nearly every scene, but Fregosi notes at several junctures that the jihad's cruelty waxed and waned depending on the ruler or commander involved.  There were plenty of monsters set loose by the jihad, such as Lala Mustafa and Selim the Grim.  But the it also had noble figures, such as Almanzor and Ali Pasha.  Fregosi also gives examples showing that the cruelty was not all on one side, especially in the Balkans.  The bibliography is excellent, an education in itself.<br />Fregosi writes that we have to accept the past, it cannot be changed, and gives only a few mild admonitions about the modern dangers of militant Islam.  The historical narrative is laid out entertainingly enough, but with due respect to all combatants worthy of it.  The ending is perfunctory, and the picture selection is inadequate, but this unique popularization is a fine history refresher.  For everyone wanting to know \\"why do they hate us.\\"	2002-01-10

In that year, of all the reporters and editors on staff, he only knew of one person who voted for Ronald Reagan, and that was the paper's art critic, Hilton Kramer.  Kramer left a couple of years later, continuing his art criticism in the _New York Observer_.  But he also set out to do battle with the cultural Left, that &quot;herd of independent minds&quot;, in Harold Rosenberg's famous phrase.  Eventually, he founded the _New Criterion_, an intellectual journal, which features some of the finest cultural criticism on offer today.  This book, Twilight of the Intellectuals, is as much a retrospective of his often lonely mission, as it is a survey of the political climate of American intellectual culture in this century.<br />_Twilight_ differs from Paul Johnson's _Intellectuals_ in treating only 20th century intellectuals.  Plus, Kramer's high culture background allows him to provide the reader with more insight into his subjects' worlds, as opposed to Johnson's uniform tarring of his as scoundrels (mostly accurately, though).  Kramer even expresses some nostalgia for some of the people here, such as Kenneth Tynan, giving him his artistic due over the political divide.<br />But in the main, his work here is a series of  political polemics.  &quot;Socialism is the religion people get when they lose their religion,&quot; is how the Catholic intellectual Richard John Neuhaus described the mindset that Kramer battles here. Throughout, Kramer selects his old articles with the intent of fixing the truth about influential leftist intellectuals firmly in the cultural memory.  People like Lillian Hellman, Alger Hiss, Dwight MacDonald, Mary McCarthy, and such are all known qualities now, and do not need to be refuted afresh.  But they still hold places of honor in institutions where like-minded intellectuals cluster, so the task of telling the truth about them is an ongoing one.  The progressive myth surrounding Hiss is still so thick that Kramer felt compelled to include two essays about his case.<br />His praise of Sidney Hook, the lone ranger of socialism, is fulsome, and deservedly so.  Hook did much of the heavy lifting in building the Marxist mindset among American intellectuals in the Thirties, and then atoned for it with a long, noble and lonely career as an anti-communist cold warrior.  He oddly tags Hook for a philistine, though, for having pooh-poohed an anti-communist arts festival with the comment that artistic greatness could appear in dictatorships, too.  Hook was right on that point, though, in my opinion.  A musical program of Shostakovich and Prokovieff at their best would more than stand comparison with a program of contemporaneous Western composers, caged birds though the Soviet artists were otherwise.<br />His estimation of Saul Bellow may be a little unfair.  Bellow has never been known for being a brawler, which may explain Kramer's disappointment in his seeming acquiescence to PC attacks against him.  One _Herzog_, one _Mr. Sammler's Planet_, ought to be enough to ask from any writer's career, without also being called upon to spend creative energy in opinion journal polemics.<br />A print reviewer of this book commented on how entering the culture wars must have retarded Kramer's potential as a critic, by draining his powers.  I don't know about that, but he makes a convincing Horatius At The Gate, giving battle to the herd of independent minds, who marched in leftist lockstep so disgracefully, for so long.k of telling the truth about them is an ongoing one.

A most welcome part of this book are the portions devoted to songwriter Pete Brown, who teamed with Jack Bruce for some of Cream's best-known classics. Over the years in various interviews Eric Clapton has fostered the idea that he was the whole show, so this material is an appreciated corrective.  Much of the material on Bruce's and Ginger Baker's days with the Graham Bond Organisation come from Brown.<br />The Cream material itself is a fan's dream come true. Jack Bruce and Pete Brown provide most of the reminisces. (Don't overlook the sidebar quotes in the concert log section at the end.) The illustrations are plentiful, including album covers, concert photos, publicity stills, magazine covers, etc. The only mild disappointment is that there are no pictures of Felix Pappalardi included. I'd love to see a picture of him in the studio, playing the piano on &#34;Badge.&#34; More oddly, there are no pictures of their 1993 reunion. That's just as well, though. I am continuously grateful to Baker, Bruce, and Clapton for not cheapening Cream's achievement with endless reunions and farewells, as some well-known bands from their era have done. It'd be embarrassing to see Cream spending their golden years on the county fair concert circuit. Their career was cruelly short, but no one can say that they didn't leave a beautiful corpse. And now they finally have a worthy history of their achievements. Those were the days, indeed.	2001-06-29

Another book of letters by another famous author I read recently was embarrassingly boring--it never should have been printed.  But Chandler's style and pithy observations make this collection a treat.  Though a loner and a lush, he maintained cordial relations with his colleagues, and his comments on the passing scene are keen. From acerbic observations on life in southern California, to wry descriptions of his cat's habits, to sometimes generous and sometimes acerbic appraisals of agents, publishers, and fellow writers, his prose is absolutely sparkling.<br />His coverage of Oscars night in the mid-Forties for The Atlantic magazine is a masterpiece of scorn for the glitterati.  Around the same time he accurately dismisses the new medium of television's supposed threat to the book industry.  People who tune in to watch &quot;fourth-rate club fighters rub noses on the ropes are not losing any time from book reading.&quot;  Just as frequently, Chandler comes across as thoughtful and a good friend--not at all Marlowe-ish, though you get the feeling he could be a tough guy if need be.  If you read only one book of collected letters of a famous author this year, etc.	2001-06-28

Mencken's arrival on the literary scene in the opening years of the 20th century.  He wrote millions of words, and has been the subject of many biographies.  Despite all the ink spilled by and about him, the fragmentary nature of his autobiographical works still strikes one as a tragedy.  He began keeping a diary from the mid-Thirties, when he was over fifty, and his career-ending stroke cut this autobiography off just before he started writing about his glory years of the Twenties.<br />It's a pity, certainly, but editor Jonathan Yardley has done a splendid job editing the manuscript down to this book.  Yardley succeeded in accomplishing his goal, to &quot;let Mencken be Mencken&quot; and to keep himself in the background.  One approvingly contrasts this style of editing with David Cairns well-researched but fussily-footnoted _Memoirs of Hector Berlioz_.<br />So, we have Mencken's own account of the beginnings of his career, and his encounters with publishers, editors, poets, writers, and other notables of the 1910s.  The only person who gets treated as an equal is his partner at _The Smart Set_ magazine, George Jean Nathan.  Most everyone else has their weaknesses and strengths--if they have any strengths in his eyes--baldly and succinctly described.  We meet the then up-and-coming Theodore Dreiser, Edgar Lee Masters, and Ezra Pound, to mention a few.  Mencken gives us some flash-forwards every now and then--we see Pound as a raving brownshirt in the Thirties, demanding to be published in Mencken's magazine.  Mencken prints the text of the withering reply he sent back.<br />Mencken's tone can be off-putting for a neutral reader.  He frequently comes across as suaver-than-thou, unconned and unconnable.  But most likely only people who already love Mencken will read this anyway, so they will enjoy themselves nonetheless.  And he is very funny in some vignettes.  Read the one where he and Nathan pretend to be interested in a tramp poet's tour of Greenwich Village.<br />There are two paragraphs early on in the book which may serve as the thesis statement for his whole life and career.  In them, he describes how he was never attracted to religion or its secular imitations, nor ever considered himself a tool of the plutocracy.  And indeed, a review of his output does show that he fell into his distinctively cynical style very early in his career, and never seemed to find cause to depart from it.  In this biography he relates his activities and his reasons for them with very few emotional asides.  Like a speakeasy gin-and-tonic, this is astringent stuff--but it hits the spot.e interested in a tramp poet's tour of Greenwich Village.  <br />There are two paragraphs early on in the book which may serve as the thesis statement for his whole life and career.

Fighter aces such as Adolf Galland, panzer commanders such as Michael Wittmann, generals such as Erwin Rommell, all enjoyed the unfeigned respect of friend and foe alike.  The soldierly virtues of boldness, duty, martial skill, and dash transcended national and ideological boundaries.<br />The most highly decorated man on the German side during World War II was Hans-Ulrich Rudel, stuka pilot, and this picture biography is a 277 page long valentine to him.  He comes across as quite an alpha male in these pages.  His lust for life brought him success in his military career, and his postwar mountaineering and sporting competitions.<br />Now, if you're here, you probably already know the background of Rudel's weapon of choice, the Junkers Ju-87 Stuka divebomber.  By the time the war started it was already obsolescent, beginning to be outclassed by fighters entering service with the Western allies.  But in the early going it was the very outward and visible sign of Nazi hyper-aggression.  The black crooked-wing craft even looked somewhat like a flying swastika.  The whine of its propeller and the screech of its dive siren triggered terror in its victims.  Though the Stuka was soon driven from the skies of the Western front, it served in the East as a most capable ground attack airplane right up to the very end of the war.  Rudel's Stuka was equipped with 3.7 cm flak cannons, to make it a feared _panzerknacker_, or tank buster.<br />This book relates in minute detail Rudel's many accomplishments.  He and his squadron single-handedly beat back a Soviet armored assault.  He rescued the crew of a downed Stuka from under the noses of the advancing Red Army.  He was himself downed behind enemy lines and got back to his base in a masterpiece of evasion and escape.  He even lost part of a leg and kept flying, was officially grounded and kept flying clandestinely.  He finished the war with upwards of 2,500 combat missions, 500 tank kills, and one sunk battleship to his credit--an amazing feat given that he flew a slow, out-of-date aircraft in a theater where the enemy enjoyed air superiority from about 1944 onwards.  Thank God his side lost, but the man deserved all the praise he got.<br />The latter third of the book deals with his postwar career as an adventurer masquerading as an industrial salesman.  While &quot;alive and well and living in Argentina&quot; he schmoozed with the Perons, climbed the world's highest volcano three times, and got in some high-diving--all this with one leg, remember.  Curiously, the book makes no mention and includes no pictures of Rudel's funeral, though the German edition of this translation was published four years after his death.  It also does not discuss his continued Nazi sympathies, and his recurring embarrassment of the West German government with his right-wing activities after the war.  But be charitable: he was the greatest combat pilot ever, and should be respected as suching clandestinely.

L. Mencken accounts for much of the negative reaction to this fine compilation of medical quackery.  The information in it has aged well; only some of the sales and marketing trends data have begun to go out of date.<br />It's a depressing tale, reading how quacks prey upon the ignorant.  Desperate people are not skeptical people, so the svengalis adroitly use auto-suggestion, nature taking its course, and sheer chance to bolster their claims of wonder-working.  A little appeal to paranoia helps, too:  \\"The big bad meanie drug companies don't *want* you to have this _special_ treatment!\\"<br />The durability of quack remedies is well illustrated in the treatment here of chiropractic.  The physiological basis for the central claim of chiropractic, \\"subluxation\\", has been debunked time and again.  But facts are no match for marketing.  \\"Chiropractic WORKS!  Chiropractic WORKS!  It WORKS! It WORKS! It WORKS!\\" is dinned into the public in response to criticism.  And its popularity is higher than ever now.<br />What's extra-bemusing is how all these backwoods remedies and crank therapies have not only come into vogue in recent decades, but that they have acquired cachet.  Things like herbalism, chiropractic, magnetotherapy, and such are now yuppie lifestyle accessories, even being pitched by famous author-physicians on public televsion.  Author Stephen Barrett has a very good website about medical quackery, but given the credulity and scientific ignorance of the general public, his is quite an uphill battle.  Sound medical advice, with its inevitable grey areas, equivocations, and responsible aversion to blanket generalizations, is frequently outshone by the upbeat flummery and soothing lies of the quack.  But, if the reader is prepared to think critically about the allure of the quasi-medical fads popular today, this book is as good a nonsense detector as there is available today.ular today, this book is as good a nonsense detector as there is available today.	2001-06-05

From the Jews the movement spread, and soon the characters of most heathen races began to grow gentler, thanks to the lawgivers and thinkers in every land.  Savage and cruel brutality changed to mildness, so that profound peace, friendship, and easy intercourse were enjoyed.&quot;<br />Thus did the 4th century A.D. Church historian Eusebius describe the civilizing effect of the Jews in Old Testament times.  Much the same thing happened in the career of Christianity in its centuries of growth.  Turning the bloodthirsty savages of northwestern Europe into mild Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, and Englishmen is a revolution of the spirit not to be sneezed at.  One might even argue that every good thing in the Third World, from the implements of basic hygiene to the freedom of speech with which the South's representatives rail at the West have their roots in Christianity.<br />History may or may not have eventually provided some other cultural engine to propel humanity upward through the ages, but the fact remains that it was Christianity which became the agent for progress in the West.  It was in the Christian milieu that the great universities were founded, that magic and superstition gradually became scientific inquiry, that the options of charity and loving-kindness were extended to the nasty, brutish, short-lived populace, that the great political concept of liberty was forged.  The ancient Chinese did not lack ingenuity and talent, but their philosophies enforced fatalism, not aspiration.  To the religions of the Indian subcontinent, reality was an illusion to be dispelled, and life a cycle to be transcended.  And, once the Arabian ascendance had passed, only the brilliance of the Ottomans kept Islam for awhile from the incurious fundamentalism of the yoke of the Koran.<br />This is not a scholarly book; rather, it is aimed at the Zondervan and Joshua's Christian bookstore crowd.  The author scores a perfect bullseye on his own foot in one chapter, however.  After having lauded the role of Christianity in the lives of the founders of modern science, he embarrasses himself by reverting to a defense of biblical inerrancy.  He deploys a few shopworn creationist assertions that any informed and unafraid middle-school student could refute with ease.

WWJD, indeed... This is one of the knotty themes explored in Shusaku Endo's novel _Silence_.  Another is the historical resistance of Japan to Christianity.  It was tolerated for about fifty years after its introduction by the Portuguese, even enjoying some cachet among the Japanese nobility.  But by the opening decades of the 17th century, Christianity was banned, missionaries were unwelcome, and the church was forced underground.<br />Thus the stage is set in this novel for a test of faith.  Where do personal beliefs end and the greater, universal good begin?  The dilemma of Fr. Rodrigues is not the whole and entire point of the story, though.  What place does a weakling like the traitor Kichijiro have in the Kingdom of God?  Why did Christianity flourish in the Philippines and later in Korea, but not in Japan?  And most mystifyingly, where is God in His silence?<br />Endo's style in translation has a delicate, porcelain-like quality to it, which makes the calamaties that befall the fugitive priests more acutely painful.  The denouement is unforgettable, though it is not the only such passage in the book.  An earlier scene showing a priest trying to rescue Japanese Christians being executed is also heartbreaking.  _Silence_ is a thought-provoking imagining of how real life can trump our own ideas of what constitutes faithfulness.	2001-06-02

Quick, name another newspaperman/critic/author from the Twenties who is a household name eighty years later.  The answer is: We still have Mencken, so who cares!<br />It's amazing how H. L. Mencken's career as a wit and cynic has survived his mortal life.  Every quotation book except the most insipidly sweet has a generous helping of his wit.  His will specified that his diaries be published thirty years after his death, and his autobiography thirty-five years (IINM) from the same event.  So, in the past decade and a half, we kept having these time-delayed literary stink-bombs going off, causing as much uproar among the present-day Sensitivity Commissars as his stuff did among the more conventionally upright in his time.  And then prime material like in this book has been lying in closets, forgotten, for decades.<br />This book was compiled from a sheaf of manuscript that Mencken had been working on, intending for a sequel to _A Mencken Chrestomathy_, when he was incapacitated by his career-ending stroke.  This material is not floor sweepings, as might be feared with a posthumous sequel consisting of diverse material from a considerable range of time.  _A Second Mencken Chrestomathy_ is as rich a feast of Henry Louis' output as could be imagined.  Much of it had been through Mencken's revision process: a piece would originally appear in the newspaper, then HLM would spiff it up for one of his _Prejudices_ collections, then it would get a going over for inclusion in the _Chrestomathy_.  Editor Terry Teachout has done a great job boiling the results down to the present tome.<br />By most accounts, Mencken was a kind and generous man.  So the arrogance bordering on misanthropy towards his fellow Americans on display here makes for unsettling reading.  As much as one wants to laugh along at his deprecations of Congressmen, mobs, and professors, one knows that one's own turn on the dunking platform is coming.  In my case, it's the South, which, intellectually speaking, according to HLM, barely exists.  Ouch!<br />Unlike a critic like, say, Randall Jarrell, Mencken didn't try or pretend to be anything other than a critic, his language book and some poetic juvenalia aside.  Instead, he poured quite a lot of creative energy into his criticism--in some especially vinegary pieces here, the words practically curdle on the page.  He was a Libertarian at bottom, convinced of the mindlessness of the populace at large, the rascality of the elected officials, the wrong-headedness of any kind of professional uplifters--and yet seemingly peace with himself and the world, and quite happy to be here to see the show.  Times changed, and he fell out of vogue with educated types.  In the Twenties his libertarian instincts set him in opposition to Prohibitionists and Gantry-ish clergy.  But in the Thirties the same instincts caused him to pish-tosh Marxists and other social engineers--and suddenly he was alone, as Marxism had quite carried the field of upper-class American intellectuals.  (Read Sidney Hook's _Out of Step: An Unquiet Life in the Twentieth Century_, for more of that aspect of that era.)<br />His literary criticism passed through the same prism.  In this collection, he damns with faint praise _The Grapes of Wrath_, for Steinbeck's depiction of the Joads' being the victims of anything other than their own inferiority.  And he praises _Ethan Frome_ for its depiction of the utter joylessness of the New England peasantry.  In music criticism, German music was the high-water mark.  In political reporting, democracy was a circus run from the monkey cage.  In such a long, public, and highly outspoken career, there were of course errors of more than just tact.  He judged the onset of the Second World War by the experience of the First--indeed, his pride in his German heritage made him more wrong than he might have been.  Disbelieving in goodness, he never perceived Hitler's unique evil.<br />But all this is a matter of record.  If you love Mencken but have missed this collection, you'll want to lock yourself in your room with it for a week at least.cken but have missed this collection, you'll want to lock yourself in your room with it for a week at least.	2001-04-30

Bill Crowe did an amazing job interviewing and collecting these reminisces.  Probably some are tall tales, but that won't stop anyone from enjoying them.  They are divided into sections such as &quot;Cutting Contests&quot;, &quot;On the Road&quot;, &quot;Pranks&quot;, etc., with some chapters being given over to especially memorable characters like Bix, Duke, Bird, and Dizzy.  Crowe seems to have made the mid-Sixties a cut-off point, which accounts for only a couple of mentions of Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and the complete absence of a certifiable space ranger like Jaco Pastorius.  But how inna namea pete did he manage to avoid any good stories about Sun Ra?<br />These stories make for enjoyable, even compulsive reading, and the urge to quote will be irresistable.  Bix Beiderbecke returns from a road trip wearing strange clothes.  &quot;Did you have a good time?&quot; ask his friends.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; he replies.  Slim Gaillard, who loved to append scat monikers like &quot;-vouty&quot; and &quot;-roony&quot; to people's names, is introduced to Mickey Rooney, and asks what Mickey's last name is.  One bibulous musician was persuaded to cut back on his evening's drink by his hostess, who release her pet rabbit dressed in hat and jacket into the room, after secretly instructing other guests to ignore the rodent.

He decries the progressivist idiocies about race he sees in urban policy, in the media, and in race relations, not much differently than in similar books by conservatives.  But who is he talking to?  The leftist ideologues for whom thoughtful liberals like Sleeper served mainly as beards have long since completed their Long March through the institutions, and don't need to pretend to take their counsel anymore.  Nor would race warlords who make their living from racial strife care to lend an ear.  Periodically throughout the book, he pauses and fires a blast at conservatives, for &quot;balance&quot;, maybe.  But a conservative reader could easily reply, &quot;Well, we told you so.&quot;  For example, Sleeper  in an aside deplores the vulnerability of helpless minorities to the amoral market forces of capitalism.  This is true, but not exhaustively true.  Maybe, if liberals and their allies hadn't worked might and main to weaken (&quot;transform&quot;, in their parlance) intermediary institutions like the family, the church, the educational system, etc., these people might be bettered buffered against the storms of life.<br />None of this is to suggest that the book isn't good--it is.  Jim Sleeper is an accomplished magazine writer, and has done a great job marshalling his arguments in this very readable and thoughtful book.  Declining the role of savant, he includes excerpts of material from experts including Glenn Loury and legal scholar Randall Kennedy. Students of issues like these have simply read this particular catalog of ills many times before, is all.<br />There is a surprise, though.  In the inevitable section where we are urged to re-embrace the vanished values of old, Sleeper offers the example of the New England village.  And who personifies this Yankee resilience?  Of all people, W. E. B. Dubois.  Dubois is like the soldier who threw himself onto the barbed wire so that other men could run up his back and advance.  He fought American racism for most of his very long life, only to give up on America and fall into the pan-African and communist delusions just as his efforts were succeeding back home.  Sleeper tells Dubois' tragic tale, ingeniously illustrating how his starchy small town values sustained him, and suggesting that those sound virtues would sweep away a lot of liberal racial hypocrisy.  He may be right.  But who's listening?a surprise, though.

Books abound which promise E-Z enlightenment, and people abound who have failed to avoid them, to their sorrow.  M. Scott Peck's remarkable career has bucked the marketing trend of these books by reiterating the commonplace truth, &quot;Life is difficult.&quot;  The wisdom that so many people have found in his works is thanks to his clinical psychological experience and to his Christian faith, which nowadays is somewhat filtered by a nimbus of syncretism.  He hasn't always made all the right moves.  _People of the Lie_ nearly went off the rails toward the end when he used his theories about evil to settle some old personal scores.  And _The Different Drum_ threatened to float away into the New Age, as well as betraying some truly embarrassing political stupidity about communist countries.  But _The Road Less Traveled_ was a lodestar for me at an impressionable age, as it was for millions of others.<br />So it is with a degree of nostalgia that I took up _Abounding Grace_.  I am an insatiable quote-hound, so I hoovered the contents as fast as I could, and passed them along to people who could also appreciate them.  It is a big book with a dozen chapters, with many subheadings for each one.  The authors of the quotes are identified, but not the sources, and there is no index.  The narrative introductions to the sections are themselves strewn with quotes-a little sneakiness by the author to get me to read them?  They also include various anecdotes and personal opinions about the virtues being treated.<br />The quotations are well chosen, many of them being unfamiliar to me (which, if I do say so myself, is saying something).  All are good and pithy, and are sure to strike a chord with someone.  He indulges in an ipsedixitism or two, quoting himself, but that's okay; he's entitled.  _Abounding Grace_ is a fine handbook of wisdom, which looks like it will return many hours of pleasurable self-discovery.strike a chord with someone.

Throughout much of the Eighties and Nineties, it seemed that he had been overtaken by the changing times, as every satirist eventually must be.  The sprayer of irony one day finds himself drowing in it.  His two smash novels pointed to new directions for him.<br />But here is this grab bag of old and new material, picking right up where his last such, 1980's _In Our Time_, left off.  He didn't include any of his very witty caricatures here, though-too bad.  One of the essays, &quot;My Three Stooges&quot;, a barrel-roll around his literary competition, would have been a good forum for them.<br />That piece, &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; is a terrific rejoinder to his critics in thenortheasternliberalliteraryestablishment.  The writers who inhabit the Long Island-Martha's Vinyard-rural New England triangle have been so increasingly irrelevant to the rest of American life that it's all the New York literary taste-makers can do to keep them afloat.  This may be the knock-out blow for them, as Wolfe touts the vital but neglected role of reportage in bringing the parade of American life successfully to print.<br />Wolfe's style has remained rather static over the years.  He still uses his familiar panoply of ellipses, italics, and repetition, though the pages are not as annoyingly snowy with them as in his earlier days.  Mysteriously, he recycled a _lot_ of snappy turns of phrase from earlier books.  I mean, verbatim passages of description, &quot;gold chains twinkling in his chest hairs,&quot; &quot;hung their hides over the edge,&quot; &quot;Please God, don't let me look old,&quot; to list a very few, all made memorable appearances in his work decades ago.  Plus, the use of tell-tale brand names as punchlines makes some older essays sound stale, as those brands have lost their cachet or stigma over the years.<br />The collection has its strengths and weaknesses, of course, like all collections of anything do.  _The Right Stuff_ notwithstanding, Wolfe is not a science writer, and his two essays on sociobiology here feel like oversimplifications.  There's surely room for satire in that field, but this doesn't feel like his best work.  The horselaugh at _The New Yorker_'s expense is a cute souvenir of Sixties New York, but no more than that.  And &quot;Ambush at Fort Bragg&quot; confused a lot of people, perhaps because the story didn't tell them what to think about the events.  Just enjoy the characterizations, then.  A more detailed acknowledgements section would be useful, showing when and where these pieces are from.<br />But &quot;Two Men Who Went West&quot; is a very interesting tale about the birth of Silicon Valley and its unique corporate culture.  &quot;In the Land of the Rococo Marxists&quot; is a richly deserved, exquisitely drawn out sneer at pampered academic radicals, and how they have coped with their side losing the Cold War.  &quot;The Invisible Artist&quot; is a surprisingly affectionate account of the career of Frederick Hart.  And the introduction to the book, &quot;Hooking Up&quot; is vintage Wolfe, modern mores seen through the uncomprehending eyes of a deftly-detailed ordinary joe.<br />So everything old is new again!  The reporter-satirist-novelist-reporter still has a sharp eye for the current scene, even if his style is flash-frozen in time.

We are very close to that point now--the incomprehensibility of physics' leading edge, not the ultimate equations.  Even the best science popularizers have trouble transmitting the current state of things to the public.<br />So a book like this is probably inevitable.  It is survey of cosmology for curious Sunday newspaper readers.  It seems to be a digest of other popularized science books, books that are written for a more educated audience.  In fact, quotes from those other books are sprinkled throughout this one, fun-facts style.  Which is fine--I grew up on Isaac Asimov's books of science essays.<br />The first few dozen pages about the numeral zero and the &quot;psychology&quot; of nothingness are kind of superfluous, but Cole soon settles down into her main narrative treating cosmology.  Her humor is cute or cutesy, depending on your taste or mood.  But the analogies she uses, in a subject where the only substitute for analogy is math so rarified it doesn't even use numerals, are quite apposite.  She is a little too free in stating that &quot;scientists think&quot; this or &quot;physicists have discovered&quot; that, as many of the theories here have not been totally or even widely accepted.  And many of the theories that do hold sway are merely the best of an unpalatable lot, in the currect unsettled state of cosmology.<br />So, if your usual popular science reading includes people like Timothy Ferris, Dennis Overbye, or Rocky Kolb, this book may be a tad superficial for you.  But if you want a fast skim of the subject, or if you are coming to it cold, it'll do fine.	2001-03-22

The surviving oldtimers were just re-working their catalogs.  &quot;Progressive&quot; trends had dead-ended into the indeterminacy of free jazz, the popularity of which was not boosted by its elements of black militancy.  In the meantime, rock and roll and Motown were happening, forging new musical paths upwards from their blues roots and winning broad audiences.  Rock in particular at this time was gaining respect, as The Beatles and Bob Dylan brought thitherto unknown sophistication to rock songwriting, and artists like Cream and Jimi Hendrix would soon state their cases for instrumental virtuosity in rock.  Some young jazz musicians sought for ways to meld the fluidity of jazz with the power and-let's face it-fun of rock.  This book is their story, and of the artists who followed in their trail.<br />This book is dense with timelines, trends, and capsule histories.  It is the only book on this subject known to me, and I am glad to learn of the existence of many of these forgotten pioneers and overlooked innovators.  Saxophonist Charles Lloyd, in whose group Keith Jarrett got a start, carved a niche for himself by playing Coltrane Lite to the psychedelic crowd.  Don Ellis played to the same audience using wild time signatures with &quot;groovy&quot; coloration.  In more modern times guitarist Scott Henderson tries to lure metalheads to his brand of hard fusion.  Of course we also meet more familiar acts, like John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report, and that shifting assemblage of uncredited songwriters, sidemen, producers, and engineers collectively known as Miles Davis.<br />The story is enriched by a lot-and I mean *a lot*-of eyewitness accounts and reminisces.  The improvisational hard rock of Cream turns heads in the New York jazz scene.  Vibraphonist Gary Burton and guitarist Larry Coryell follow Cream onstage at the Filmore.  Jazz drummer Buddy Rich adds Beatles songs to his setlist, busying up the arrangements past recognition.  Larry Graham of Sly and the Family Stone invents bass &quot;popping&quot;, which is quickly integrated into the jazz vocabulary.  The Mahavishnu Orchestra turns out to be even more daring in concert than on record.  The rash young Larry Coryell tries to cut Jimi Hendrix onstage, and is blown out of the song by a massive wail of feedback as punishment.  Hendrix especially casts a long shadow throughout this book, as do Cream.<br />One can always carp about where the author draws the line about who to include.  Spirit doesn't rate a profile?  Drummer Ed Cassidy had only played with Thelonius Monk, Cannonball Adderley, and Gerry Mulligan, is all.  But that's all part of the fun, I suppose.

It was a less than successful action, one of a series of such by the British and Canadians in France.  The Germans were superb defensive soldiers, and they checked Montgomery's forces time and again.<br />  On this particular section of front, the Germans held all the high ground.  They were able to block British movements by day, allied air superiority notwithstanding, and rebuild their defenses by night.  The lumbering Tiger tank and 88 mm anti-tank gun were nightmares to the crews of the inferior British armor--and to the Polish army-in-exile crews of the lend-lease Shermans.  &quot;Tommy-cookers&quot;, the Germans called them, on account of their combustability.<br />  The solution the British command came up with was to launch an armored attack at night.  Tracer fire would mark the boundaries of the assault lanes, and strategic bombers would act in a tactical role, pulverizing the German rear.<br />  The usual &quot;fogs of war&quot; descended over the plan: last-minute tinkering by the commanders, unexpected movement and resistance by the Germans, columns going astray, friendly fire from the bombers, etc.  The Poles were too eager for revenge and outstripped their support.  The Canadians were too reserved in places and did not gain ground that they otherwise might have, or else were destroyed when they cornered first-class German armored formations.  The front was too narrow for such a heavy attack, and it ground to a halt about ten miles from its objective, Falaise.<br />  This book, however, shows how no combat is minor to its participants.  The book opens with an eye-witness account of the night assault.  Red and green tracers zip overhead.  Armored vehicles in the column are little more than shadows in the blacked-out conditions.  The canucks in a personnel carrier go flying when a grenade lands in their vehicle.  Shell-stunned Germans huddle in a ditch, watching the column go by.  Bombs roar.  Muzzles flash.  And so forth.  It continues with other first-person stories of the attack, which are as dramatic as anything from better-known battles in WWII.  It points up the fact that a battle may be no less enormous or horrible to its combatants for being little known.

The disguise is very convincing--author Jack Dann has done a great job setting the scenes of his story.  In Italy we have torchlight processions, raving mobs, daggers and poisons, sunny Tuscan uplands, cluttered artists' studios, decadent nobility, and etc.  In the Levantine lands, we have double- and triple-crosses, parades of cavalry, sumptuous banquets of whole beasts on rice, scheming slavegirls, wholesale slaughter of innocents, and so on.<br />  We also have an improbably gifted hero, only our belief is willingly suspended because Leonardo really was improbably gifted.  In this novel, he is not the emotionless man of impersonal genius we think of today.  Rather, he is very like his fellows: a man of hot italianate passions, excelling in many fields like most of his colleagues did.  One feels upon reflection that the real Leonardo must have seemed thus to people around him--maybe more single-minded in his work, maybe a few shades more accomplished in his art, but not seeming out of place in the Renaissance, a time when &quot;a man may do all things if he will.&quot;  It was only later that Leonardo was esteemed as a genius practically from another world.<br />  There is plenty of action, lust, and intrigue, some of it bumping up against many readers' comfort threshold.  These, and the marvelous scene setting, carry the novel's entertainment value.  The character development is strictly standard fantasy fare.  The bonds between the characters are shown mainly by having one group set off somewhere, and another character demanding to be allowed to go along.  Suspense is achieved by having Leonardo demand to know where somebody is, or where he himself is being taken.  He also, despite receiving frequent veiled and unveiled death threats from the powerful, becomes their trusted confidant.<br />  So if this sounds interesting, go ahead and enjoy it.  The weaknesses were not apparent to me until second reading, so strong were the book's strengths.  I shall remember this feat of imagination for a long time.econd reading, so strong were the book's strengths.  I shall remember this feat of imagination for a long time.	2001-01-14

Cioran certainly belongs in the ranks of the best epigrammists.  He had the gift of brevity.  His remarks focus or refocus the mind, like the best aphorisms do.  Also, they are as bitter as a hydrochloric acid martini.  (Click the nearby link to read an excerpt) If Sartre had had the gift of speaking in quotes, he might have resembled Cioran to a degree.  Yet Cioran was _so_ disaffected, _so_ shackled with irony, _so_ sure that he saw through everything, even skepticism itself, that he never would have bothered to construct a philosophical edifice like Sartre's.<br />  The problem with this collection is that it was originally published in the early Fifties, and Cioran was a depressive.  So, most of Cioran's political and religious observations have been soundly refuted by the events of the subsequent half-century.  The West was not rotten and exhausted; the Catholic church was not a gilt mausoleum; the way forward was not only downward.  He made the quite simple and quite avoidable error of projecting his own personal misfortune onto the whole universe.  So go ahead--partake of this sour spirits, in small drams.  The chapters of quotes on things like music, solitude, and that French favorite The Void hold up very well.  Just don't mistake it for real life.	2001-01-08

The future  film director Jean Cocteau, on leave from the Western Front, snapped pictures of the group indoors and out.  Time passed, the friends went their separate ways, and the pictures were dispersed into different hands.  Three-quarters of a century later, a Swiss electrical engineer collecting photos of the Montparnasse scene discovered that several of the photos seemed to have been taken at the same time.  This book is the story of how he discovered other photos in the series in different collections around the world, how he discovered the identity of the photographer, and how he pinpointed the day and time the pictures were taken.<br />This is an amazing book, as much for the ten-plus years it took to sleuth this story out as for the fact that anyone did it at all.  The author, once he went to extraordinary lengths to collect these photos, even consulted the French Bureau of Longitudes to analyze the shadows in the pictures, in order to fix the time of day.<br />So, what do we have?  Pictures of Picasso as a man in his mid-thirties (with a full head of hair!), in cafes and on the street with other artists, notably Modigliani and Kisling, and his then current amour, and other acquaintances.  They cheerfully pose and mug for their friend Cocteau.  And that's it, really.  The text relates the story of how these photos were taken, and how the author discovered when, where, and by whom they were taken.<br />As if that wasn't impressive enough, he then adds chapters which deduce what kind of camera Cocteau used, maps of the area with the camera angles plotted, and selections of drawings, diaries, and correspondence that illustrate one detail or other of the pictures.  It's all very interesting, in a headache-inducing way--rather like contemplating a picture painted on a grain of rice.

The author details his experiences with different tactics of office politics.  Although he is obviously highly disciplined and determined, with expertise out the ears and an incredible capacity for work, he does not make himself the hero of his own battles.  He honestly relates his own defeats and blunders, explaining how some of the tactics in his book were used on him, or how he mis-used them.  Tellingly, there are rationalizations of some hardball tactics that almost sound like the stirrings of a guilty conscience.  In one instance, he sabotages a colleague's career to save his own, and spends some ink justifying it. But such moments quickly give way to a resumption of office tactics and career strategies.

What is wealth? How do you get it? What does it mean to the wealthy person, and to the rest of society? _The Rich and How They Got That Way_ is a fun pop-history/collective biography of wealth and the wealthy. Through the biographies, we see how in ancient times accumulation of wealth was simply a matter of looting other peoples' movebles. Then coinage became widely available, and trade became more diffused and profitable. Then paper currency loosened money from its metal base, and fortunes were made in speculation. And so on, on down to the mass marketing of the present day, and the fortunes that it spawned.<br />The best chapters are those in which an economic pioneer is riding the crest of a wave of innovation. The accounts of Jacob Fugger, John Law, and Richard Arkwright are thus very good. The naked capitalism of Arkwright's time during the Industrial Revolution, especially, should give strict laissez-faire conservatives pause. The weakest chapter is the one on Howqua, a Cantonese merchant. It seems clear that the author felt compelled to include the Opium War in this book, but couldn't find a compelling personality. So she just used an individual who appeared in the historical accounts somewhat more than other merchants did. That, or political correctness compelled her to include a set number of non-westerners. I would have been more interested to read a chapter on the British East India Company, and how it failed to suppress the Dutch economy, but did drop a world-wide empire into Britain's lap.<br />The concluding chapters show how the rich became more common in society, and how the superrich have struggled to distinguish themselves.  From conspicuous consumption to conspicuous philanthropy, from imitation European chalets to bathtubs that can be activated by remote control from the car, how the rich got rich and how they struggle to get richer is an absorbing story.  A light, fun historical read.	2000-11-25

His work defies analogy, let alone description.  Let's see: Ice cream castles?  No.  Victorian/Edwardian psychedelia?  Maybe, kinda sorta.  A Beaux-Arts H. R. Giger?  His work does have that certain sinuosity to it, though it contains nothing of the macabre.  It's like he was plunked down in 19th century Barcelona from some future era.  One can only imagine what he could have done with modern building materials.<br />This book is a photodocumentary of his most notable work in Barcelona, although one building out in the countryside is included.  The pictures are well composed and shot, and the text,  an adaptation of a Spanish text, is interesting and clear.<br />Architectural surprises and oxymorons abound in these pictures.  A classical caryatid is made out of small gray stones.  The frame of a stained glass window turns out to be made out of knitting needles.  The double doors of a courtyard open into a room, the entrance to which is obstructed by twin pink and yellow columns.  Chimneys and ventilators are turned into colorful cones that wouldn't be out of place in the Hall of the Elves in Rock City, Tennessee.  And the gateway to a park looks like nothing so much as a taffy-puller in action.  And to think that all this expressiveness was built just one generation before the plague of Glass Boxes spread from northern Europe.<br />The appearance of Gaudi's buildings and decorative designs is striking enough for the casual viewer.  But the details of how he came up with some of these designs is just as amazing.  For one crypt, he dispensed with mathematical calculation altogether, instead working out the stress loads with a primitive, time-consuming system of ropes and sacks of buckshot.  He was in fact so ferociously individualistic that it is amazing that he found enough patronage to keep him in work.  Thanks to his open-minded patrons, most importantly Eusebi Guell, he was free to let his talents and imagination rip.  Thanks also to his nationality--the English would have pegged him as an eccentric and consigned him to country houses.  The French would have gone into ecstasies of theorizing, but would have been mindful of how little his work promoted &quot;La Gloire&quot;.  And as for Germany, who could imagine Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm living in ice cream palaces?  But the Barcelona authorities were tractable enough to let him get away with flouting not only criticism but the very building codes.

Here, it's the federal government.  Example: What are the<br />three branches of government?  Money, television, and b.s.  It's hit<br />or miss, as most humor is, but the hits really score<br />bullseyes.<br />Whenever I read O'Rourke's stuff aloud to friends, there<br />isn't a dry seat in the house. I had the great pleasure of telling him<br />so in person at a book signing once. Parliament of Whores shows<br />P.J. to be more than a humorist--he is, if nothing else, the present<br />era's greatest political aphorist. Example: &quot;When buying and<br />selling are legislated, the first thing to be bought and sold are<br />legislators.&quot; A keeper.	2000-09-11

And nevermind that it isn't as great a masterpiece as  Tolstoy's--literature itself isn't as great as in the 19th century,  anymore.  This book stands with anything in fiction written about the first  third of the Soviet era.<br />As with all Russian literature, the English  translation gives the impression that one is viewing an intricately woven  tapestry from the back.  This is a pity, but not an obstacle to following  the story of the Gradov family.  The curtain rises in the mid-Twenties.  NEP has brought some semblance of normalcy to the economy. The Chekha,  though an object of trepidation to ordinary people, is not yet the  terror-engine it would become as the NKVD.  It's still possible to disagree  about politics, and Bolshevik art in the time of Mayakovsky and the Soviet  cubist poster artists  is still vital, not yet deadened into socialist  realist straitjackets.<br />The Gradovs are a cozy, educated Muscovite family  who have so far escaped disruption from the Revolution.  They and their  Georgian relatives get sucked into the new order, either by slowly  accreting compromises with the regime, misplaced faith in its Marxist  slogans, or outright &quot;socialist justice&quot;.  The disconnect between  the high honors heaped upon many of them, and the razor's edge they walk to  stay together and out of trouble causes all kinds of turbulent  anguish.<br />Nikita Gradov is an especially affecting character.  He is  tormented by his role in betraying the sailors to the Reds in the  Krondstadt mutiny. He is a composite of several real-life Soviet military  men.  Like Rokossovsky, he is released from the gulag to lead a Soviet  army.  Like Zhukov, he disputes a point of  strategy with Stalin and  escapes with his life.  And like Chernyakhovsky, he is KIA.<br />Throughout  the book, Aksyonov inserts several surreal &quot;intermissions&quot;.  These little episodes serve as fantasy counterpoints (or choruses) to the  main action.  For example, in one, the family dog is revealed to be the  reincarnation of a murdered boyar from the time of Ivan the Terrible.  In  another, a swarm of fireflies descends over all the scenes of the novel.  And in one, a garden squirrel is the reincarnation of Lenin himself, to  give him time to unwind before he's hurled into eternity.  These fantastic  japeries seem like holdovers from earlier in Akysonov's career, when he  would tweak the Soviet censors.<br />This novel is rich in tragedy, hitting  all the awful low points of the communist regime in Russia, and  demonstrating the moral and physical ruin it brought to the people.y dog is revealed to be the  reincarnation of a murdered boyar from the time of Ivan the Terrible.

The reader need<br />not go along with his drastic social prescriptions in the final<br />chapter in order to appreciate his clear, exhaustive grasp of the<br />scientific subjects. One aspect in particular to be grateful for is<br />Tudge's overview of prehistoric South American mammals--the best such<br />in a popular science book since George Gaylord Simpson's death.

In<br />the current dino-mania, fossil mammals are overshadowed. Too bad;<br />there are many curious and wonderful creatures in the mammalian<br />lineage. Yet, few well-illustrated popular books on the subject<br />exist. Bjorn Kurten's _Before the Indians_ had blurry charcoal<br />drawings. The late George Gaylord Simpson was an authority on<br />prehistoric South American mammals, but little more than a doodler<br />with a brush. And Colin Tudge's wonderful _The Time Before History_<br />had no pictures at all.<br />So this book is most welcome. Mauricio<br />Anton is a gifted artist. Cats and catlike creatures such as<br />nimravids, homotheriums, saber-tooths, dirk-tooths, all seem to live<br />again in these color and b/w pictures. The only beastie which is<br />unconvincingly rendered is the poorly-known _Thylacoleo_, the<br />marsupial lion.<br />Through the reproductions and discussions of these<br />and other animals, one gets a lesson in how different animals adopt<br />similar body plans, based on their ecological niche. Large top<br />predators are robust, while middle niche hunters are more<br />gracile. Thus, we are told, _Thylacoleo_, the largest nimravids, and<br />the largest saber-tooths resemble lions, while smaller predators<br />resemble cheetahs and leopards. All in all, a must for big cat- and<br />paleontology- lovers, the latter who may be getting tired of<br />dinosaurs!	2000-09-11

Not much of this book sticks in the mind, atypically for an Aksyonov  novel.  The titanically horrific events of the preceding volume,  _Generations of Winter_, practically carried the story along without help.  The comparatively (but only comparatively) milder post-war times in the  Soviet Union don't leave much for historical fiction to hinge on.  So  Aksyonov chooses to emphasize the degradation that the long years of war,  terror, and compulsory adulation of Stalin and the Party inflicted on the  Soviet people.  He doesn't pull it off; it's the story and the reader that  get degraded.  Stick with the first volume of this tale.	2000-09-06

This  remarkable historian, Catholic dissident, and philosopher of freedom was in  many ways the very epitome of the erudite Victorian scholar.  That is, he  was _so_ learned, that the present-day reader should distrust any reviewer,  including the present one, who presumes to encapsulate and classify him in  a few easy paragraphs.<br />  There's little danger of that from me.  This  book tells the story of Acton's life and career, and I must admit that, so  far as judging the work of author and subject, my hat's simply off to them.  It is interesting reading about things like Acton's near-excommunication  from the Catholic Church, because of his opposition in 1870 to the new  doctrine of papal infallibility, and then his continued devotion to the  Church.  His private correspondence with contemporaries, debating the great  issues of the day, particulary freedom, make for bracing reading.<br />  His  ideas in private circulation, rather than his parliamentary career or  written output, carry his fame today.  His magnum opus, _History of  Liberty_, was never written.  The only bits of it that made it to  completion were two lectures, &quot;The History of Freedom in  Antiquity&quot;, and &quot;The History of Freedom in Christianity.&quot;  Disappointingly, these and a couple of other short writings are only  excerpted here--they are brief enough to have been put in an appendix of  this big book.  Fortunately, they can be read at the Acton Institute's  website.<br />By the way, it was Acton who coined the phrase, &quot;Power  corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot;	2000-09-06

The annihilation of the Sixth Army is told, from the Soviet encirclement to the  capitulation.  The novel starts full-on and never lets up; from beginning  to end the army is defeated, spent, everyone is starving, freezing, wading  through corpses.  The only movement of the storyline is the retreat of the  hapless shells of soldiers, away from the victorious Red Army.<br />  This  Germanic heaviness is troweled on so thickly, via actual events from  Wehrmacht prisoners Plievier interviewed, that even Americans can feel the  whole Nazi edifice tottering with Sixth Army's fall.  Plievier (whose name  sounds like a derivative of the Russian word for &quot;shoot&quot;)  succeeds in putting over the full horror of battle.  He was a communist,  and his depiction of Russian troops is eyewash.  In reality, as the  introduction reminds us, the Soviets were as ruthless as the invading  Nazis, and were rarely very chivalrous to their German prisoners.  But the  informed reader can make allowances for this.  If nothing else, this is a  remarkable job of reportage of the German experience at Stalingrad.  It's  the next worst thing to being there...	2000-08-26

The book is a litany  of outrages, failures, and incompentence, linked together by the author's  exposition of Africa's pre- and post-colonial history and economics. His  picture of pre-colonial democratic Africa may be too rosy--the baroque  cruelties reported by early European explorers do not figure here--but any  surviving shred of tradition has to be better than the &quot;vampire  state&quot; that most sub-Saharan Africans are saddled with now. The litany  of horrors tends to get numbing after a while, but that's scarcely the  author's fault.

This book follows the familiar Johnson  formula of telling history: An adverbial phrase summing up a generation's  attitude here, a half-page biographical sketch illustrating a trend there,  and so on, with plenty of astringent value judgements inviting further  investigation.<br />Yes, there is &quot;bias&quot; here, but it is a  corrective one. Of course he goes overboard in spots--one can agree that  Nixon was unfairly smeared by liberals his whole career without excusing  him entirely of wrongdoing, as Johnson does. But it was news to me that  many of the people baying Nixon's heels themselves covered up wrongdoing by  Lyndon Johnson in the '60s. And it's good to have it made plain that there  was indeed a Kennedy conspiracy--to get him into office, not out.<br />Throughout, many of the ills we deplore nowadays are shown to have been  with us since the beginning--the endless Presidential campaign is as old as  the early 1800s, for instance. And Johnson's ventures into  mass-psychologizing are funny. Or unsettling, depending. Particulary novel  in a modern history book is the way that agitators and radicals are nearly  absent here. Instead, pride of place is given to ordinary working people  and the industrialists and inventors who drove the astonishing engine of  progress and innovation that America became after the Civil War. Johnson  well understands that complainers are present in every age, but that such a  sunburst of accomplishment is a rarity. All in all, an informative,  entertaining and inspiring read.	2000-08-26

This one is a perfect balance of scholarly  exactitude and layman's narrative, as well as being just to both sides  regarding their conduct of the battle.<br />  More than fifty years after  the event, the gigantism of the events around Stalingrad remains  astounding.  Beevor does a great job showing both the big picture of the  campaign and the attitudes and conditions of the fighting men.  It is clear  that Hitler bungled fatally in overriding his generals--amateurs think  strategy, professionals think logistics.  It is also clear that Stalin  finally wised up and starting trusting his generals--for awhile, at least.  One general, Rokossovsky, was released from the gulag to lead a Soviet  army.<br />  The murderous fanaticism of Nazism and the murderous paranoia  of Communism accounted for an appalling number of atrocities, quite apart  from the ferocious combat.  Even during the most desperate fighting, the  NKVD busily executed thousands of Soviet soldiers on one pretext or  another.  The Germans treated Russian peasants and prisoners worse than  their own horses.  The descent of the typical German soldier from  confidence to despair is well-illustrated with first-hand accounts; ditto  for the near super-human determination of the Soviet soldiers.  There was  no pity or chivalry in this battle; it was all hell.  To pack so much of  this truth into so readable an account is quite an accomplishment.	2000-08-23

If you landed here through a title or subject search, you've probably  already seen this book in the library.  You have my sympathy on learning  that it is out of print.  (If you came here through my personal page, I'm  flattered!)  This is a book of photographs of Russia from the decade before  World War I.  Thing is, these are mostly _color_ pictures.  This early  color process produced images that are about as good as the color photos in  the Sunday newspaper today.  The photographer, S. M. Prokudin-Gorskii,  showed the images in the form of a slide show to Tsar Nikolai II, in hopes  of having similar exhibitions in Russian schools.<br />  The subject matter  is fairly prosaic.  The images are postcard views of rustic villages, broad  rivers, wooden dams, happy peasants at work and at leisure, exotic  Caucasian and central Asian tribespeople in colorful native dress, lots of  onion-domed churches and shrines.  Prokudin-Gorskii meant these pictures to  show the pageantry and glory of Mother Russia.<br />  Today, they are  painful reminders of a world that has been smashed forever.  The peasants  would die in the Great War, or starve in the postwar famines, or butcher  each other in the Civil War, or be executed in the Red Terror.  The public  works would go to ruin due to the incompetence of the commissars who would  run them after the bourgeois engineers had been eliminated.  The colorful  tribespeople would be exiled.  The churches would be looted and demolished.  The peaceful meadows would be paved over by ill-conceived, gigantic heavy  industrial plants.  The villages would be burned by civil war and foreign  invasions.  Seeing all these images which look like they were taken  yesterday, and knowing the fate that awaited their subjects, is quite an  experience.<br />  Contrast this book to another book of pre-war Russian  color photographs, _Leonid Andreyev, Photographs of a Russian Writer_.  His  vision is much more personal, but no less poignant.	2000-08-11

Miguel Covarrubias was a wonderfully entertaining caricaturist.  If you  can't find any samples of his work on the web, just try to imagine a cubist  Al Hirschfeld, and you'll have _some_ of the idea.<br />  Covarrubias drew  mainly for the old _Vanity Fair_ back in the '20s.  Clark Gable, Alexander  Woollcott, Shirley Temple, Paul Whiteman, and other luminaries were  portrayed in caricatures that ranged from art-deco to surrealistic to  economical doodles, almost every one conclusively capturing the spirit of  the subject.  His eye became somewhat less keen as the Twenties rolled into  the Thirties, and he couldn't relate as well to the mood of the new era.  However, his second-rate work was streets ahead of most illustrators' best,  so don't let that put you off.  He seems to have drifted out of the  profession well before dying in the late '50s.<br />  Once again, it's a  shame that this book is OOP.  Covarrubias belongs in the Twenties pantheon  he caricatured so incisively.	2000-08-11

So absolute was the  Communist Party's hold on all aspects of public life in Russia in Stalin's  reign, that famous people, who had been praised to the skies just the week  before, could be utterly effaced from the public's mind through sheer  terror.  Once someone fell from favor with the dictator, his name and  picture were erased from the public record--even books critical of the  person could be proscribed--and to even mention his name might mean prison  or worse.  This book is the author's attempt to trace the trail of  falsification through Stalin-era photos and artworks.<br />  It is a  testament to the censor's thoroughness that the trail is quite incomplete.  In many cases, the author hasn't been able to find even the name of the  extirpated individual in the before-and-after photos.  Some of the examples  given here were taken from the folio albums of the Soviet photographer  Rodchenko.  After the bureaucrats he had photographed were arrested and  shot, he went to work inking and scissoring out his own work, the images of  the new non-persons.<br />  The heroic photomontages, with the jut-jawed  Bolsheviks vanguarding the masses, are appalling when you think of how many  would later be arrested, tortured into accusing themselves of the most  heinous, yet baseless, crimes, and then shot.  The damned were airbrushed  out of the picture, replaced with a stripped-in comrade, or a painted-in  pillar or staircase, sometimes leaving a shoe or elbow that the retoucher  missed.  The Western mind shudders at the slavish worship that Stalin had  at his command, to cause such colossal lies to be perpetuated.  Read this  big, lavishly illustrated book, and get the real picture.	2000-08-11

David Robbins became a writer after, apparently, a midlife career switch.  He's thrown himself into his new vocation with  visible gusto.  According to interviews available elsewhere on the web, he  researched this story very doggedly, if not completely thoroughly.  For  instance, he knows the diminutive forms of many Russian names--Tolya and  Anatolushka for Anatoly--but apparently not the more formal Russian habit  of addressing people by name and patronymic--Anatoly Ivanovich.  This  is not an account of the entire battle of Stalingrad, so the background is  broadly brushed in.  Military buffs as well as the general reader will  quickly grasp the setting.  Since the principals are snipers--silent and  deadly--there is a lot of internal monologue, to help the story along.  Zaitsev the _okhot_, the Siberian hunter, is well-realized, while his  adversary Thorvald is just slightly B-movie-ish.  Tania the female sniper  is an anachronism.  Making her an American and giving her modern gender  political attitudes must be the author's way of appealing to his Western  readership.  The love scenes strain plausibility--one occurs right after  the snipers have crept through a sewer.  The reader already knows what a  hellhole Stalingrad was; there's no need for the author to flog the point  like that.<br />  There are many fine turns of phrase in this book, and the  sniper duels are frequently very exciting.  Tom Clancy might have treated  the technical aspects of the weaponry more convincingly.  Lous L'Amour  certainly would have brought out Zaitsev's hunting abilities more vividly  (read _Last of the Breed_)  But Robbins deserved credit for making a woman  the co-lead in a novel like this.  It's a brave gambit to include so many  gooey love scenes, even if they are unwanted by most readers.  This book  doesn't hit the bullseye, but it is an enjoyable account of a conflict  within the larger battle.thin the larger battle.	2000-07-31

The real author used to be an automobile advertisement illustrator in the '50s, which accounts for the other half of  the book.

Blueblood nostalgia for the Jazz Age is sent up in gags on  conspicuous consumption like &quot;Indoor Golf&quot;, &quot;Autogiro  Jousting&quot; and such.

They eat junk  food, stink up their van, compete for groupies, drink Miller (did Miller  pay the author to praise it so highly, so frequently?) No drugs,  surprisingly.  The band's leader had skirted stardom in CVB, and is now  sinking back into the heavy-lifting obscurity of the lower reaches of the  entertainment industry.  The mopey drummer mopes along through the book  until he discovers that he's gay--his is the only happy relationship in the  story, btw.  And the characters alternate between faith and cynicism about  rock itself.<br />Thing is, it's not always so entertaining, watching people  waste their time, not to mention their lives.  There are some surprises  here and there.  A music industry suit turns out to be an ok guy, for  example.  And the leader agonizes over his post-music future at another  point.  But mostly, everyone stays true to type.  Some Baptist sorority  girls are brought onstage for comic effect--but maybe it would have been  interesting for the bassist to have a serious conversation with them,  instead of flashing them.  As it is, it takes a twist in the tale to keep  the book from petering out as wanly as the tour.  The author opts to  introduce himself, and make the book into a gay awakening tale in the final  chapter.<br />As for the running Persian Gulf War parallel, it serves mainly  as a calendar.  This reader couldn't care less about what any entertainer  thinks about any political issue.  And the author's attempt to hearken back  to Vietnam and classic rock is soundly spiked by his proofreader's  unfamiliarity with and resulting inability to spell &quot;Khe Sanh&quot;  and &quot;Glyn Johns&quot;.<br />But hey, it's only his second novel.

He  was also a pioneering photographer, working with the autochrome color  process.  This book is a collection of his personal photos of his family  and friends, at his estate on the Gulf of Finland and also abroad in Italy.  It is amazing, seeing pictures from about ninety years ago that look as  though they were snapped yesterday.<br />Andreyev looks every bit the  artiste here, with his mane of jet-black hair and trim, elegant beard,  practically gazing a hole right in the negative.  He caught the  personalities of his subjects in a way that this amateur can only envy.  He  even captures the pain and resentment in the faces of his two live-away  young sons.  The landscape photos he took of the surrounding area make for  rewarding viewing, too.  A motor launch on a calm body of water, a back  view of himself surveying the frozen sea, his garden in spring and winter,  his hulking timber-frame home at sunset...amazing.<br />But what really  bridges the decades are the views of Marseilles and Rome, in the decade  before World War I.  Looking at color photos of people in turn of the  century garb, standing in places where jeans- and Lycra-clad tourists  throng now, really brings the past back with almost shocking immediacy.<br />If you can, compare this book with  _Photographs for the Tsar_ by Sergei  Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii.  That book is also a collection of color  photos from before the war, though it is a collection of Russian postcard  views for the edification of Tsar Nicholas II.  It makes quite a contrast  with the powerful personality evident in Andreyev's vision.	2000-07-08

Policies, trends, and attitudes that were taken in deadly earnest once are now as dead as the  Hapsburg dynasty.  And things like the New Left, presumed dead &amp; gone  by the middle Seventies, worked their way, tapeworm-like, into the academic  and cultural centers of American life, to metastasize as Political  Correctness in our own day.  The Sixties made the big splash; the Seventies  saw the ripples spread out over the entire national surface.<br />David Frum  is an outstanding magazine writer, and this book is the more remarkable in  that it doesn't read like a series of stitched together articles.  This  fault is what marred David Horowitz's book about the Sixties, _Destructive  Generation_.  Each section--on politics, morals, the almost frantic  debauchery, education, feminism, Vietnam, etc.--contrasts the situation,  policies, and mores of mid-century America with the profound changes that  swept the country during that decade.  (Curiously, he does not treat rock  music, which finally ceased being just entertainment and became a bigger  business than major league sports.  Plenty of other writers have gone into  rock critic overdrive on that score, so it's no big loss here.)  Surprisingly, the Seventies do not always come off the worse for the  comparison.  The civil rights movement may have begun its long descent into  senile malcontentness then, but it was also then that the black middle  class was cemented and began to expand.  Public works may have been  paralyzed by quarreling factions, but it was then that deregulation began,  which gave us our present consumer paradise.  The Presidents may have been  crooks and incompetents, but Reagan's rearmament, which won the Cold War,  began on top of a build-up from late in the Carter years.<br />Throughout,  Frum deploys many interesting details representing the issues he talks  about.  His writing is very clear--and we know that often clarity is  mistaken for truth.  Yet his _tour d'horizon_ is an appealing one, and he  is honest.  He does not glorify the WWII generation more than their due,  nor does he try to build a better yesterday.  He also says that the  Seventies were no blip, but that instead they brought us back to America's  pre-Depression usual self--polyglot, pleasure-seeking, and self-interested.  The Greatest Generation, says he, were equal to their great challenges,  but they were atypical.  As for the present, in these hangover years we are  newly cautious, not remoralized.  He leaves the question open whether we  will ever be able to construct anything like the pre-Sixties moral  consensus again, though he does not hesitate to say that many aspects of  it--high, firm standards in education and culture, loyalty, prompt  Americanization of immigrants--would be great to have back.  All in all,  this is a breezy but thought-provoking trip back to what Doonesbury called  &quot;a hemorrhoid of a decade.&quot;s writing is very clear--and we know that often clarity is  mistaken for truth.

It helps to appreciate this memoir if you have an idea of who Bruce McCall is.  The best way of doing that at one stroke is to read his cartoon collection, _Zany Afternoons_, which is out of print.  _Thin Ice_ is a tale  of a joyless family ruled by a loveless, inconsiderate father, seen from  the viewpoint of the artistic child.  By all rights, I should dislike this  book, as I think giving one's parents the &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot;  treatment is ungrateful, unless they were downright abusive.  As the  psychiatrist said to the centaur, &quot;Stop blaming your parents.&quot;  Yet he recreates his childhood homes and family climate so winningly that  the story overcomes such resistance, and we are transported back with him.  All those witty zingers about how dull Canada was are entertaining, too.  The book ends just as he is on his way to revive his career in the States.  Since that is where, by his own definition, the &quot;good part&quot; of  the story lies, let's hope he produces the next installment soon.	2000-06-19

This is the book that prevented the New York literary cognoscenti from completely dismissing Solzhenitsyn as a ranting bumpkin.  This is the book  that gave hope to Russians that the mass graves of zeks would not be  unaccounted for, after all.  And, this is the book that inoculated me  against my college education.  It is the literary equivalent of that famous  photo of the lone man facing down a column of tanks at Tiananmen  Square.<br />As Solzhenitsyn is at pains to impress upon us, it is not a  political expose'.  Rather, it is an effort to collect victims' testimonies  to the savage early decades of Soviet rule.  It is also, and more  importantly, an exploration of the human soul under all-out assault by the  state.  As Western leftists, complicit in the worst crimes against humanity  ever committed, innocently glided from &quot;It never happened&quot; to  &quot;Who cares?  It can never happen again&quot;, this book brought all  the evil of Soviet communism into the light.  That light was the moral  vision of arguably the 20th century's greatest prophet, without honor in  the putative homelands of liberty, and in perpetual mortal danger at  home.<br />The first book of _The Gulag Archipelago_ takes the reader from  arrest through interrogation, transport, and transit camp, up to the gates  of the labor camps themselves.  Along the way, there are many asides about  prison life, its denizens and customs, and the spiritual deformations they  inflicted.  There were whole waves, entire cycles, of specifically targeted  repressions.  Hundreds of thousands of people were disposed of without a  trace, either by bullets or by exile above the arctic circle.  The  repressions of 1937, the _Yezhovschina_, made Western intellectuals gulp  only because, for a change, the victims were communists.  We also, through  Solzhenitsyn's account of his spiritual awakening, get an up close view of  how a strong religious faith can sustain a person in the face of this  faceless evil (though this aspect is more fully developed in volume  2)<br />What makes this &quot;huge, loose, baggy monster&quot; of a book more  remarkable is that Solzhenitsyn never once had it all on his desk at the  same time, for a proper editing.  Parts of it were always stashed away  somewhere, while he was working on another part, always under official  surveillance.  No pampered western academic radical could last ten days  under those conditions, let alone produce such a powerful witness.  Read  this for a bellyful of what it is like not to be free, what it costs to try  to become free.

Not a portrait gallery, as that would imply a grander presentation of the principals, but a snapshot album.  Mr. Jeffcoat has got the right idea, mostly, and is eager  to buck us up, and help us weather the anti-American effluvium spewing from  academia and the entertainment industry these days.  However, his writing  is disappointingly uninspired.  This becomes almost embarrassing when he  presents writers like Walt Whitman and Ralph Waldo Emerson.  The quoted  material from those remarkable men utterly overshadows the surrounding  exposition.  This does not happen to a writer like, say, Paul Johnson.<br />A  bit more rigorous editing might have deleted things like the ridiculously  brief entry on William James, which is only three-quarters of a page long.  And I'm sorry; but the Sixties hippies were not what I'd call optimists.  Being happy because you've decided not to grow up is not optimism.  At the  end, the standard catalog of cultural woes is run through, along with the  standard appeals to the traditional American virtues to carry us through.  An important message, but one that has been much better told elsewhere.	2000-06-13

This book _A Time of Terror_ is a detailed first-hand account of one such  crime.  The author, as a sixteen year old boy, was arrested for rape and  robbery.  By his account, he was no more than an unwilling accessory, a  wild kid just starting to go wrong.  His companions were soon arrested, and  one horrible night the white citizenry broke into the prison and lynched  them.  Cameron was beaten, strung up, and just about to be killed, when he  heard a lady's voice commanding the crowd to release him.  No one else  heard anything like that, but the mob did indeed cut him down and help him  back into the prison.  This miraculous rescue helped turn him to Christ  years later, once he was out of prison.<br />This narrative is very valuable  for the flesh and blood details it provides to the era of lynching.  Cameron records his terror at seeing familiar white faces, people he had  cut grass and run errands for, howling for his blood.  The lynching was not  sudden--people moved into town days beforehand, and news of the impending  atrocity was even broadcast on the radio.  Firemen sent in to disperse the  crowd with water spray instead invited the mob to come aboard the trucks  and cut the hoses.  Cameron tried to hide among other black prisoners, but  the mob threatened to hang them all, causing them to finally give him up.  Possibly most horrible of all, these events took place not in the South,  but in Marion, Indiana.<br />Cameron faithfully tells his tale seemingly  without embarrassment or residual hatred.  His father was worthless.  He  and his friends were indeed up to no good the night they were arrested.  Far from being passive victims, community blacks took their firearms and  tried to drive into town to protect him, but they were turned back by  police.  And Cameron notes those few white people who were kind to him.  All these details provide context, and makes the lynching appear even more  monstrous than any sociological jargon possibly could.<br />The second half of  the book is an account of his prison years, and it is nothing special.  The  epilogue, a speech given when he was presented with the key to the city of  Marion, is a touching example of forgiveness, such that only greatness of  spirit and possibly extreme old age can bring.

Despite our best efforts to discard or &quot;outgrow&quot; the idea, sin remains a woven-in part of the human tapestry.  We have not made ourselves into  exceptions to human nature, and we are very like other people.  Such is the  thesis of the late British expatriate journalist Henry Fairlie, who also  used to write for The New Republic.  His style is very grave, like a less  colorful G. K. Chesterton, or an even more disaffected Allan Bloom.  He  describes himself very aptly as &quot;a reluctant unbeliever&quot;.  Yet,  while he cannot accept that we can in some way grieve the Supreme Being, he  is sensitive enough to see the wreckage that sin visibly causes in our  earthly lives.  &quot;Sin is the destruction of one's self as well as the  destruction of one's relationships with others,&quot; he says.  What makes  this be sin rather than just some ordinary failing of character is that sin  perverts something indefinably fundamental in us, from which all the rest  of our humanity proceeds.<br />And so off he goes, incisively describing and  deploring each of the traditional Seven Deadly Sins. His heartfelt,  well-supported exposition should win understanding and respect from  believers, and should give unbelievers pause.  His politics sometimes trip  up his argument.  &quot;Even our socialism is sinful...&quot;--as if a  political system based on breaking the Eighth and Tenth Commandments could  ever be anything but sinful.  But such missteps do not impede this  pilgrim's progress<br />What does bring everything to a screeching halt is the  final chapter, &quot;The paths of love&quot;.  Here his agnosticism brings  him up short, and he is quite at sea trying to formulate a counter-balance  to the awful fact of sin.  One hopes that he eventually realized before he  died that he didn't have to re-invent the wheel.  An incredibly brave  near-classic from a modern &quot;pagan worthy&quot;.	2000-05-30

Thomas Disch's talent and way with a phrase carries such readers through an interesting, original plot, and vivid characterizations.  Many of his  sentences indeed have the same impact as a jazz phrasing, as one print  reviewer said.<br />Coming back to it in midlife, the book impresses only with  the above technical aspects.  The escapist theme now seems immature, and  the oppressive society of the midwest from which the hero escapes is just  Disch--and a thousand other transplants thinking that they are destined for  bigger things--sticking his tongue out in the rear view mirror on his way  to The Big Time. At the end, the villain guns down the hero, and then  recites the Pledge of Allegiance.  How silly is that?  People who imagine  themselves to be the brains or conscience of America really should lay off  mocking people who are America's backbone.<br />The soaring dude on the cover  of my old copy looks a lot like Tom Cruise, though...Maybe we'll see a  movie of this someday.	2000-05-25

Well, this particular bit of history is not yet past enough for anyone to convincingly lie about.  When some Russians urged  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to let the bad old days of Stalinism lie  undisturbed, the queasiness they were feeling was the same as what any  American with a living soul would feel looking at these pictures.  Just as  any given Russian could have had an NKVD informer or torturer in his  family, so too any American might have a relative in these mob  scenes--killer, victim, or onlooker.  Yet Solzhenitsyn answered them,  saying that if a person suffered from a terrible sickness and then was  cured, he would rejoice that he had recovered.  But if the sickness was  still in him, he would be silent about it, and regard any probings into the  matter with trepidation.  Which state of mind is our nation in regarding  this disgraceful aspect of our national character?<br />The facts of lynching  should not be news to an educated American of any age.  Pictures such as  these may be found in most any history of civil rights book.  Yet this is  the only book known to me to collect these images in such a large,  apparently well-researched collection.  The images, many of which were  actually made into souvenir postcards, are well-reproduced and annotated.  The accompanying captions are sometimes garnished with quotations on  lynching by famous black Americans like Richard Wright and James Weldon  Johnson.  Wherever possible, the date, location, circumstances, and  identity of the victims are given.  The text says that there were a little  less than 5,000 known lynchings, though the number is probably higher.<br />The text of the book may be skipped without loss.  It is mostly either  psycho-political jargon, delivered in the hideous academic prose typical of  higher education nowadays, or leftist agitprop, which does not shrink from  implying that all modern conservatives are lynchers at heart.  The pictures  are the story here, not the commentary.<br />Photography delivers impact,  not context.  Yet there is no mitigation possible here.  White American  citizens, filled with righteous wrath, without fear of and sometimes with  the complicity of law enforcement, regularly committed extra-legal  executions within living memory.  They stormed prisons, seized inmates, and  killed them, sometimes in horribly baroque fashion.  If this fact is too  dark to bear, then you might also read something like _Speak Now Against  The Day_, which tells how black and white citizens tried to co-operate for  civil rights during the same time period.

If you enjoy looking at old photos, these richly repay the  viewing.  The plantation scenes are interesting--many such grand houses  still survive, so it is intriguing to see them peopled with their original  inhabitants.  The portraits are also compelling, as we try to read the eyes  of the subject across the void of years.  The author does climb on rainbows  a bit, trying to get into these people's minds.  And he is inexplicably  wrong about the first photo in the book--the black gardener is not in the  photo by mistake, but obviously by the family's choice, since the long  exposure required by the primitive cameras obliged the subjects to be still  for an appreciable length of time.  Plus, he is clearly posed in a well-lit  spot.  Quibbles aside, this is a very interesting collection of antebellum  photos of black Americans, slave and free.

Brave explorers searched for the Open Polar Ocean.  Large swaths of continents were marked &quot;unexplored&quot; on maps.  The geological  systems of the world were barely glimmers in the minds of the first of the  great 19th century scientists.  After reading this book, with its  fast-forwarding and reversing through geologic time, one feels like we're  hanging on to a tiny, fragile marble by our fingernails.  There's such a  thing as an overdose of perspective!<br />A lot of improbable things seemed  to have had to happen for higher life to evolve on earth.  The authors say  that microscopic life may spring up wherever there is half a chance, but  animal life requires a lot of just-so adjustments--adjustments that the  Earth took billions of years to perform.  For life--meaning carbon-based,  liquid water requiring life, other elements being ill-suited to being a  base for life--to arise, the sun had to be a yellow main sequence star, and  the earth had to be a certain distance, and there had to be plate  tectonics, liquid water, a magnetosphere, possibly a freakishly large moon,  maybe asteroid bombardments, not too much exposure to gamma rays or nearby  novas, and who knows what else.  The authors postulate that such a chain of  circumstances is probably rare in the universe.  This is a disquieting  thought, to think of entire gigantic elliptical galaxies probably being  barren of life. So, far from being the crown of creation, we seem to be an  accident, contemplating an accident.<br />Whether you accept their hypothesis,  or you think the universe is buzzing with other sentient life, it is  educational to read the latest ideas about the origin of life, the history  of Earth, and several of its more probable dooms.

It had become apparent that the sediments of the world did not trace to a single forty-day flood.  Plus, fossils of  extinct creatures were being identified, suggesting that death had been  present in the world before the creation of Man, contrary to the Bible.  Now, at the time of this book, the new habit of observing nature without  preconceptions was giving rise to the notion that Europe had once been iced  over by gigantic glaciers--a form of destruction found nowhere in  Scripture.  This book is the story of how the glacial hypothesis was  broached, how it was hooted down for decades, and then finally accepted  once people became acquainted with the giant glaciers of Greenland.  The  accounts of the exploration of the coast of Greenland are thrilling--this  is quite a long way from running climate modeling programs on a computer!  This episode in the history of science certainly bears out the importance  of imagination, for the idea that the Alps and the Scottish tarns were once  locked under moving ice was quite beyond the scientific establishment of  the day.  In most other popularized science history books I've chanced to  read, Louis Agassiz is portrayed as the doddering, hidebound  anti-evolutionist.  So it is good to see his vibrant, groundbreaking early  career told here.  This is a very insightful account of how science's view  of the world changes under the weight of new evidence, and how it sometimes  takes a leap of imagination before everything appears to fit.	2000-05-19

Next time the next government-funded art atrocity hits, remember GKC's  summation of artistic types:  &quot;Poets and such persons talk about the  public as if it were some enormous and abnormal monster-a huge hybrid  between the cow they milk and the dragon that drinks their blood.&quot;  Or  next time a relativist runs his different strokes argument at you, you can  return with this: &quot;The modern habit of saying, &quot;Every man has a  different philosophy; this is my philosophy and it suits me&quot;--the  habit of saying this is mere weak mindedness.  A cosmic philosophy is not  constructed to fit a man; a cosmic philosophy is constructed to fit a  cosmos.  A man can no more possess a private religion than he can possess a  private sun and moon.&quot;  And what more wry defense of faith has ever  been penned that this:  &quot;Bowing down in blind credulity, as is my  custom before mere authority and the tradition of the elders,  superstitiously swallowing a story I could not test at the time by  experiment of private judgement, I am firmly of the opinion that I was born  on the 29 of May 1874 on Campden Hill, Kensington.&quot;  As you can  see, Chesterton is very quotable.  This book is desirable if you love the  Father Brown mysteries, and would like a sampler of his popular essays.  If  you are familiar with his nonfiction, you would probably want the  full-length versions, available elsewhere--though the long introduction by  Russell Sparkes is very good and worth having.

This book is an imaginary dialogue, in which the existence of moral absolutes is emphatically affirmed, and relativism and relativists are cast into outer darkness.  Kreeft does not have the epigrammatic gift like his great  predecessor G. K. Chesterton did.  In fact, GKC summed up much of this  book's argument in a single quip: &quot;One can no more have a private  religion than one can have a private sun or a private moon.&quot;  But  Kreeft accurately spots and calls to account much lazy thinking that's out  there.  For instance, if all values are &quot;culturally determined&quot;,  what are we to make of people whose values impel them to resist and  denounce their own culture?  Plus, he is quite funny in places, and  sympathetic readers will enjoy the protagonist's zest in making his  arguments.  Throughout, Kreeft--through the fictional mouth of 'Isa the  absolutist--insists on the primacy of people's experiences and reactions  over any philosophical system, and of the pre-existence of a discoverable  Truth.  This book settles nothing, as such things can never be settled.  But it _is_ a big morale booster to Christians who may be becoming fatigued  under the amoral onslaught of our culture nowadays.  It is a puff of a  refreshing breeze, heartening us to say &quot;Here I stand, I can do no  other.&quot;  Even if you are Catholic! :)	2000-05-03

He brings an incredibly rich artistic and liberal arts background to his season in China, and faithfully records the flying sparks of the encounter.  China is not a simple culture, and Holm respectfully writes no more than what he personally learns.<br />The thing that make this book different is that, instead of the usual slices of life + bigthink one finds in travel writing these days, he has organized his observations into a lexicon of essays.  For instance, one essay entitled &quot;Black Hair&quot; relates the Chinese people's fascination with his red hair; another, &quot;Tickets, Please&quot; tells of his frustration at simultaneously having to have a Chinese factotum and being subjected to constant petty price gouges.  Whimsy and offbeat insight abound, as his sense of irony and humor and humanity are touched seemingly at every turn. Ten years later, I'm still enjoying this unique little book.<br />It takes a little bit of effort for a non-liberal to enjoy this book, if that is an issue for you.  Prof. Holm is an academic culturatus of the first order, with little that's kind to say about less refined Americans.  He seems to have a special contempt for his American students, as they come off the worse in comparison with his rapt Chinese pupils. Maybe if he transferred to a _college_, instead of teaching thirteenth grade at his state institution, he'd find more enthusiastic students.<br />Most depressingly familiar is how, like so many other academics, he reckons his professional skill and artistic talent as translating into political perspicacity.  This leads him into such nauseating statements as one in which he explicitly draws a moral parallel between the election of a Republican president of the U.S. in 1988, and the Tiananmen massacre the following year.  His disgust at lumpenprole Americans is such that he records himself inwardly shouting at them, &quot;I'm the American! Not you!&quot; Prof. Holm is a member of America's cultural elite, and there's nothing wrong with that.  But ideas that don't work tend to cluster in institutions where ideas don't have to work in order to survive. That's a reason why so many of his mindset are clustered in academia.<br />But if none of this bothers you, or you agree with him, then this book is recommended heartily.ot; Prof. Holm is a member of America's cultural elite, and there's nothing wrong with that.

It's time for a re-issue--are you listening, Penguin Classics?<br />These stories are about a wandering  storyteller, who gets into various jams and escapes with the aid of his  silver tongue and an admiring coquette.  For someone who apparently never  visited China, and never even met that many Chinese, the verisimilitude  Bramah achieves is amazing.  This is an English child's storybook China,  yet the stories themselves richly delight adults, too.  The scene-setting  is wonderful, but the real gem is the dialogue.  Suave, sly, elliptically  ceremonious, mock-abnegating--but you really have to read it to catch the  flavor.  Hillaire Belloc's introduction is on the money about how  deceptively easy this style looks, and it is a great pity that more people  do not have the opportunity to enjoy this and the other Kai Lung works  today.<br />May your sleeves be filled with a sufficiency of taels, and may  hungry and homeless ghosts find solace at your house-pole, and preserve  your family tablets from the mischiefs of the lesser orders of the beings  of the Upper Air...	2000-03-26

This book, so  rewarding in itself, is also a great introduction to many wonderful writers  and thinkers.

But how he is able to write so much on top of that--incredible.  Now he has turned his attention to ancient Egypt.  Because this is a dead civilization, there is not much occasion here for  political controversy, and so some of Mr. Johnson's fans may miss his  pungent polemics.  They needn't.  He has compiled an largely satisfying  popular account of the land of the pharaohs, which also leaves the reader  curious to read more deeply.<br />The book is not a history.  The historical  narrative portion stops at the last great pharaoh, Ramesses III, and we  turn instead to chapters devoted to the Egyptian attitudes of government,  religion, art, and death.  Johnson does a great job taking us inside the  minds of the ancients by showing how, to them, these ideas were  inseparable.  His sources and illustrations are well chosen, though he  continues to be plagued by sloppy editing.  A couple of incorrect captions,  a reference to an work of art &quot;now in Leningrad&quot;, that sort of  thing.<br />Each of his chapters are distillations of subjects which could  have been (and are) the subjects of entire books.  The account of the  Western rediscovery of Egypt during the Age of Science flitted by too  quickly for me--I wanted to read more about the adventures of Napoleon's  very talented egyptologists. And the classical Greek historians like  Herodotus are dismissed as little more than purblind tourists.  Well, sure;  based on what we now know.<br />This is a fast-paced book about a static  civilization, a coffee-table book with serious, substantial text.  Sounds  oxymoronic?  Well, it's true.  Paul Johnson does it again!	2000-03-25

It is mostly composed of soldiers' accounts of their experiences of trench life and warfare, along with the emotional, moral,  and spiritual dislocation that they endured.  One quote from a German  soldier on leave gives an idea of what horror they lived under, yet grew  familiar with.  &quot;I am restless.  I hate the kitchen table at which I  am writing.  I lost patience over a book.  I should like to push the  landscape aside as if it irritated me.  I must get to the Front.  I must  again hear the shells roaring up into the sky and the desolate valley  echoing the sound.  I must get back to my Company...live once again in the  realm of death.&quot;<br />This book is not as slick as the companion to the  PBS series, yet it seems rawer, more real.

Now that the Soviet parenthesis has closed, the historian Robert Conquest has been soundly vindicated.  It was he, and a very few band of fellows, who _completely_ rejected the progresive aura that Soviet Communism inveigled so many other academics with.  His books dealing with specific incidents and epochs of Soviet rule--sometimes for the first time in English--were resented by leftist professors as being &quot;reactionary&quot;.  Now, those books may be seen as bold testaments to the truth about Communism, published in times and places where that truth was most unwelcome, though undeniable.  If you can find them, read some intellectual journals' reviews of the first edition of _The Great Terror_, to see the psychic indigestion Conquest's work caused them.<br />This book is a fairly concise summary of his opinions about how so much evil came upon this century, why so many otherwise good and intelligent people were taken in, and What It All Means.  Familiarity with his previous work is assumed, so if you are new to Conquest, read something like _The Great Terror_ first. The book is arranged in thematic chapters.  Each chapter consists of brief, numbered essays--&quot;reflections&quot;--somewhat like a less aphoristic Eric Hoffer, though this book is very quotable.  Conquest is very old, astonishingly widely read, multi-lingual, and is an altogether trustworthy and admirable figure.  It is important to remember this, because much of the book is tough sledding for less well-educated readers.  Because he hates cant and sweeping generalizations, his sentences are sometimes over-stuffed with qualifiers and conditional phrases, making them precise, but a bit hard to unpack on first reading.  And he's not ashamed of the impressive vocabulary he's amassed, either.  &quot;Chiliastic,&quot; &quot;accidie,&quot; &quot;tergiviseration,&quot; and more will tax your pocket Websters. And is &quot;fissiparous&quot; really _that_ much more fitting than &quot;divisive&quot; in discussing how political and national unities are dissolved?<br />Style aside, the book is less a refutation of Communism and its Western towel boys, than it is a consideration of how it and they could have enjoyed so much power and prestige over the years.  All the familiar famous dupes are brought out for more execration: Duranty, Shaw, Wells, the Webbs, and prominent Marxists like Eric Hobsbawm.  They are not actively engaged and disproved--that was done long ago a dozen times over--so much as they are practically drummed out of the ranks of moral, or even sentient beings.  Pretty harsh for people who only wanted to &quot;make a better world&quot;.  Yet they deserve it.  As Conquest says, &quot;Many whose allegiance went to the Soviet Union may well be seen as traitors to their countries, and to the democratic culture. But their profounder fault was more basic still.  Seeing themselves as independent brains, making their own choices as thinking beings, they ignored their own criteria.  They did not examine the multifarious evidence, already available in the 1930s, on the realities of the Communist regimes.  That is to say, they were traitors to the human mind, to thought itself.&quot;<br />The closing chapters concern the current state of education, the European Union, nationalism, prospects for Russia and for the West, and such.  Only time will tell, etc.; but Conquest richly deserves a hearing on these issues, by virtue of having been so resoundingly right about the most important issue of this century.  He is, once and for all, a hero of the Western tradition of liberty and civilization.  This book is a fitting capstone to possibly the noblest career in academia in the latter half of the 20th century.

Maybe, maybe not.  In this book the author takes us around to visit many Hasids  from all backgrounds.  There are interesting facts for the goyish reader to  learn--there's something called &quot;glat kosher&quot;, when ordinary  supermarket kosher isn't good enough.  We meet callow young converts, fiery  older converts, gnarled old Polish survivors, midwestern Hasidic meccas (so  to speak), and more.  Any generalization about religion will of course  prompt other people to leap into print to rebut it.  But this is still a  good accessible introduction to this tiny, but growing community of faith.  I recommend reading this in conjunction with Elie Wiesel's _Souls On Fire_,  which is a collection of his grandfather's tales of the old Hasidic  masters, including the original, Israel Baal Shem Tov.	1999-12-19

Once you understand that this is not _Darkness At Noon_ or _Dr. Zhivago_, you can  accept it and its horrifyingly high numbers as intended.  The authors have  taken advantage of the opened KGB archives to track down the details of  hundreds of repressions and atrocities committed by the Soviet power in the  name of their ideology.  They do the same for other communist regimes like  Cuba and China without the benefit of archival materials.  The fact that  they still have to round the death tolls to the nearest thousand in many  cases firmly makes the authors' controversial point:  Communism is the most  murderous idea ever devised.  One of the authors asserts that communism is  not one whit a lesser evil than nazism.  It lasted longer, immiserated and  killed more people, and had more friends in influential western  institutions, no matter that the repressions and killings were class-based  rather than race-based.  The book has two generous photo-inserts, to make  the text's point more immediately.  The arrival of this book, along with  _Venona_, _The Haunted Wood_, and _The Shield and The Sword_, gives  heartening evidence that the murderous truth about the Communist era may  finally seep into the general consciousness, if not yet into the  politically correct recesses of tenured radicaldom.  Here are the  facts--hereafter, ignorance about communism is strictly voluntary.	1999-12-01

Jacob Holdt brings a keen journalist's eye, a disinterested foreigner's  perspective, and a Sixties leftist's skull full of mush to the photographic  theme of  poverty in America.  Skip the text, it's too silly to bother  with.  Our narrator submits to homosexual date rape from one of his fellow  hoboes, out of pity for his &quot;oppressed&quot; state.  He fumes at  well-off Danish transplants, who moved to America in search of better life.  All his subjects--southern sugarcane cutters, inner-city welfare  recipients, pool hall loungers, bums--are victims of oppression.  Like any  good leftist, Holdt does not hesitate to make the perfect the enemy of the  good, and to ascribe to American society an immediacy of persecution which  simply does not exist. Luck and responsibility are not in the program  either.  The pictures themselves are rich and absorbing, poking into  tender places that most comfortable Americans would rather not be poked.  In time, these images may rank with the poverty pictures of Riis and Lange.  Holdt has made himself into the figurative fly on the wall to enter the  lives of his subjects, rich and poor.  He records images of startling  intimacy and pathos.  There isn't even that much of the old crusading  photographer's cliche of the seated figure clutching his head (despair?  headache?  sleepy?).  It is perfectly calculated to appeal to the  sensibilities of leftists and to the conscience of successful Americans  suffering from White Liberal Guilt.  Jacob Holdt, with mock scrupulosity,  assures the reader that this is a slice of life, not an indictment.  As an  indictment, which it most certainly is, its emotional impact is sizeable.	1999-09-17

It's frightening to think how all the  achievements traced in this book--the very glory of Western  civilization--have been jettisoned by the universities nowadays, the better  to worship at the altar of the Left's holy trinity: race, sex, and class.  Well, their God is too small, and thirty pages into _Civilisation_ the  reader will be grateful for the corrective he now holds.	1999-09-03

In a 1000 page novel where not much happens, he  reproduces a dying age in almost frightening detail, and amazing breadth.  Here is Mother Russia, lurching towards disaster.  The few competent people  grapple desperately with the wasting war, the feckless monarch, the  deadwood bureaucracy and top brass, and the cant-besotted activists in the  Duma, with their proclamations, declarations, and ultimatums.  Around the  margins of the looming catastrophe slink the agitators and terrorists and  revolutionaries, chillingly pitiless and committed to their destructive  ideologies.  Forebodings of the impending Communist disaster abound, of  course; and Solzhenitsyn puts his own artillery service in the second world  war to use in illustrating the battlefields in the first.  And the people  are still normal people (except for the Bolshevik automatons), loving,  longing, bursting forth with their passions, or silently enduring the  fatigues of wartime.  Solzhenitsyn also reveals himself as a fine aphorist,  as well as having an acute ear for simile (&quot;as amazed as a ram staring  at a new gate&quot;)  The _New York Times Book Review_ gave him an  unconscionable insult in their review of this book by misspelling the  hero's name throughout.  It's &quot;Vorotyntsev&quot;, not  &quot;Vorotynsky&quot;.  The Northeastern literary establishment never  forgave Solzhenitsyn for adhering to the Russian Orthodox faith in the  '70s, and such a piece of sloppy editing seems to me to be a juvenile dig  at him. Anyway, this book is not for those whom television has destroyed  their attention span.  But it is a rewarding--and sobering--journey for  those who can go the distance.	1999-04-24

In the '60's, jazz seemed to have ground to a halt.  Free jazz was so structureless that there wasn't much to be done with it, once the novelty wore off.  Black militancy in the form of Archie Shepp and Pharaoh Sanders was attempting to hijack the whole music for political ends (which some prominent jazz figures today still hope to do).  Pioneers of the previous generations were just re-working their catalogs.  And upstart rock and roll was suddenly assuming an artistic identity in its own right.  The energy of rock, as well as the unexpected sophistication of some of its performers--The Beatles, Cream, Jimi Hendrix--prodded many younger jazz artists to attempt to attached the punch of rock to the fluidity of jazz.  This book is about these artists and their successors.  Some are familiar, like John McLaughlin and Miles Davis, who are rightly given pride of place.  Some are less so, like Larry Coryell, who never could quite get the business end of his career together.  And some had been almost forgotten, like Jeremy Steig and Peter Nock, whose existences the reader is glad to learn of.  The book consists mostly of brief considerations of artists' careers and catalogs, along with the author's judgment of their worth and influence.  There's always room to quibble with these, and it's part of the book's enjoyability.  One can also always argue about the cutoff point as to who belongs in this book.  For example, Steely Dan and Cream are discussed, while Traffic and Spirit are not.  There are a number of great jazz anecdotes (search amazon for _Jazz Anecdotes_, btw), like one instance when the rash young Coryell tries to cut Jimi Hendrix onstage, and Hendrix blows him out of the song with a single massive wail of feedback.  The index is excellent, and there's a lengthy discography.  This is a treat for music-lovers!	1998-06-29
