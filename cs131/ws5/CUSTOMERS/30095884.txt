Eric Alterman's thesis rests on three parts smoke, four parts mirrors, and one-half part fact. Here's how Eric tries to make his case using intellectual and empirical sleights-of-hand:<br /><br />1. Change definitions.<br /><br /> A. Define liberalism down. If you were to argue that there is no crime problem, one technique would be to minimize the number of criminals, would it not?  Similarly, if you're setting out to convince Americans that there is no mainstream liberal media, you would minimize the number of liberals. That means people and institutions that ordinary people think of as left-wing, or liberal, are going to be labeled centrist or even right-wing. So, in Eric's world, the Democratic Leadership Counsel, Joe Klein and the New Republic are \\"neo-conservative\\" (p 10), David Broder is conservative (p 57) and Howard Stern and Don Imus are \\"movement conservatives\\" at the \\"extreme far-right end of the political spectrum\\" (p 70) (meanwhile, the anti-Bush hatemonger Paul Krugman is just an \\"economist/pundit\\" (p 13)).<br /><br /> B. Define liberalism as not really liberal. Eric notes that American liberals are to the right of European liberals (pp 17-18); therefore, his logic seems to be, even our liberal media isn't really that liberal. Wow. What brilliant reasoning. When Eric writes a book on international comparative politics and the media I'm sure that information will come in handy. Until then, it seems like a bit of a non sequitur in a book about the American media.<br /><br />2. Confuse tokenism with policy.<br /><br /> A. Eric argues that publications and other media like the New Yorker, New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Washington Post aren't liberal because they employ some conservative writers and correspondents (pp 10-11). To rebut what can only fairly be termed a really stupid argument, I need only ask whether Eleanor Clift's and Wesley Clark's presence on the Fox News Channel means Fox isn't conservative.<br /><br /> B. Eric states that the right wing enjoys a \\"vast advantage\\" in the punditry business (p 28) and that most pundits are \\"strong conservatives\\" (p 45). He cites George Will in particular, along with a couple of others. Now, let's see. Tim Russert worked for Pat Moynihan; Chris Matthews worked for Tip O'Neill, Bill Moyers worked for LBJ and George Stephanopoulos worked for Clinton. Wolf Blitzer's on the left; Larry King's on the left; Washington Week is populated entirely with lefties, Bob Schieffer's a lefty and Charlie Rose is a hard lefty. And on the right? O'Reilly and Scarborough, that's it. All the other punditry shows are half-and-half.<br /><br />3. Hide the lack of hard data.<br /><br /> A. Provide no hard data yourself. Eric complains of Bernard Goldberg's book Bias: \\"During the course of 220 pages of complaining, Goldberg never bothers to systematically prove the existence of liberal bias in the news...\\" (p 6).  In 267 pages of Eric's book, he does no better for his side.<br /><br /> Relatedly, in a monumental case of chutzpah, Eric complains about the non-scientific nature of the famous 1992 Media Studies Center survey (89% of journalists voted for Clinton) because it had only 139 respondents for 323 questionnaires mailed (pp 16, 20), but then turns around and cites in support of his counter-thesis a David Croteau survey which had 141 people responding to 444 questionnaires mailed (Ch. 2 fn 17; pp 21, 273; see the survey itself on the FAIR website). A case of journalistic and intellectual sloppiness -- or a case of \\"facts for me but not for thee\\"?  I report, you decide.<br /><br /> B. Rely on anecdotes and scattered observations. These actually comprise the bulk of the book, much of which is mere complaining, score settling and name calling. See, for example, the treatment of Ann Coulter on pp 3-5, Bernie Goldberg on pp 5-9, Bill O'Reilly on pp 35-38, Chris Matthews on pp 38-40, David Broder on pp 46-52, 57, Michael Kelly on pp 54-55 and Howard Kurtz on pp 61-69. And of couse we get theobligatory Richard Scaife and Rupert Murdoch Axis of Evil (pp 234-242, 245-256).<br /><br /> C. Gloss over unfounded assumptions. On his way to another bogus conclusion, Eric does make a salient point: it's hard for journalists to criticize their parent companies and advertisers (pp 22-27). True, but not necessarily relevant. Eric seems to be laboring under the false assumption that legal entities, insofar as they can be deemed to lean politically one way or the other, are right-wing. Not true at all. Businesses are compositions of people of all stripes on all levels, some of whom could be considered \\"conservative\\" but many others, such as the leaders of Berkshire Hathaway, Microsoft etc. are liberal. Therefore, even if there is an institutional bias against attacking companies qua companies, it operates equally between \\"left-wing\\" and \\"right-wing\\" companies.<br /><br />4. Admit the truth, then bury it. \\"I concur that the overall flavor of the elite media reporting favors gun control, campaign finance reform, gay rights and the environmental movement, but I do not find this bias as overwhelming as some conservative do...\\" (pp 109-110).<br /><br />Besides the thematic errors and contradictions described above, there is plenty of other bogus information, half-truths, distortions etc. that one has come to expect from the Left. Here are a few:<br /><br />* The Columbia Journalism Review is not one of \\"a few key journalistic watchdog institutions\\" (p xiii). Who is chairman of the CJR?  Why, that would be the same person who publishes Eric's articles at The Nation, Victor Navasky.  I think the terms \\"left-wing bias\\" for CJR and \\"hypocritically incestuous\\" for Alterman's stroking the CJR at least begin to cover *that* relationship.<br /><br />* The Bush Administration did not choose \\"unilaterally, and without any prior consultation, to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol\\" (p 18). Eric seems to think his target audience is the other side of the bell curve.  For Eric's target audience, let me explain. The Kyoto Protocol was *signed* by President Clinton a little over four months before the last day permitted under its terms.  Under the U.S. system of government, signature on a treaty is only one step in a two-step process.  The other is confirmation by two-thirds of the Senate (U.S. Const. Art II., Sec. 2, cl. 2).  In 1997, S.Res. 98, a stalking horse test vote, shot down the Protocol 95-0.  So: (1) \\"consultation\\" was made under the Clinton Administration by the Senate's test vote and (2) we were never under the Protocol in the first place!  What a totally moronic thing for Eric to say.  Does he really think that he's fooling anyone?<br /><br />* Liberalism did not find its \\"contemporary intellectual definition\\" with John Rawls' \\"veil of ignorance\\" thesis (p 19).  Rawls wrote \\"A Theory of Justice\\" in 1971.  Liberalism as an identifiable political theory had existed for years by then.  Remember Mr. Reagan's floor speech railing against liberalism's contemporary intellectual definition at the 1964 Republican Convention?  If Eric can't even accurately cite his own sacred texts, how can we take him seriously about anything else?<br /><br />* There is not a \\"far-right domination of the nation's airwaves\\" (pp 71-72). If Eric meant domination of the talk radio format, then he should have said so -- or gotten a better editor.<br /><br />* If the reason for the success of the Right in public discourse is \\"superior marketing abilities\\" (p 82), when the Left dominates the creative talent from Madison Avenue to Hollywood, then any honest liberal has to ask if it's the product and not the packaging.<br /><br />* It takes a lot of nerve to complain about the coverage Al Gore got in the 2000 campaign (pp 148-191) then not mention that the MSM called Florida for Gore while polls were still open in the heavily-Republican panhandle.  When the chips were down, the mainstream liberal media delivered its all for its guy, even at the cost of wrecking its ownreputation.<br /><br />* Florida election law was not \\"almost entirely on the side of Gore\\" (p 179) except in the sense that all the Florida Supreme Court Justices were Democrats.  Under then-existing Florida law, candidates had seven days to challenge an election and tabulate a result, which would have been relatively easy to do in the time allotted. Gore only held on for as long as he did because the Florida Supreme Court took that number seven, waved a magic wand, and transformed it into 19, then refused to set statewide standards for a manual recount, leaving it to each recounting county's Democrat operatives to fashion standards that best suited Gore.<br /><br /> The NYT itself, in a Nov. 12, 2001 article, agreed that Bush still would have won even if all undervotes had been counted. Eric contradicts this conclusion, stating that \\"No matter how you counted it, if everyone who legally voted in Florida had had a chance to see their vote counted, Al Gore was our president\\" (p 190). His support for this bold assertion? An article written by -- Eric Alterman! (Ch. 11 fn 75; pp 190, 298).  That reminds me of the line \\"While Lenin read a book on Marx.\\"<br /><br />* To Eric, it's just a \\"common-sense observation\\" to state that a journalist should not have an opinion about the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. That speaks for itself.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a mishmash of bogus and sloppy reasoning, trashing the competition, scaring up the usual right-wing bogeymen, and whining and preening.  It's fun to see the answer (such as it is) to the question: \\"How could anyone think the media has a conservative bias?\\" but not much more.audience, let me explain.

If you're a cheapskate like I am, but still looking for good analysis and at least a willingness to delve into some of the more obscure aspects of the bible, this is a good place to start.<br /><br />If I had any complaints about the book, it's that it too often veers into apologetics instead of providing clear-eyed textual analysis.  For example, the analysis provided in Mat. 27:9 can only be termed casuistry.  See p. 1229.  However, it's not like they try to hide the fact that the contributors are Christian partisans.  The backside of the book states that its contributors are \\"evangelical scholars.\\"  With that minor caveat, I say, Enjoy!	2005-09-16

Being affiliated with Mormonism and being generally doctrinally sympathetic to the religion, I have no religious beef with a Trinitarian beating up on the JWs.  Certainly the JWs are trained to give as good as they get.  To me, it's all good.  Certainly too Ron Rhodes does an ineffective job of arguing against Mormons in his book \\"Reasoning from the Scriptures With Mormons,\\" as detailed in my April 19, 2005 review.  That said, there still is no excuse for the phony and bogus reasoning of many of the JW positions that I have become acquainted with over the past eight months of bible study with them.  Here are a few of the most glaring.<br /><br />*  Jesus is Jehovah.  The \\"ego eimi\\" of John 8:58 is literally \\"I am\\" and no amount of denial, finger-pointing or obfuscation can alter that fact.<br /><br />Additionally, the NWT itself shows that Jesus is Jehovah by attributing to Jehovah the title \\"Alpha and Omega\\" (Rev. 1:8), then stating that the Alpha and Omega is also the \\"First and the Last\\" (Rev. 22:13), then stating that the First and the Last is he who \\"was dead, but now is living\\" (Rev. 2:8) i.e., Jesus.  If A=B, B=C and C=D, then A=D.  I know my transitive properties as well as anyone.  The attempt to explain away these verses on p. 413 of the JWs' \\"Reasoning from the Scriptures\\" book makes no sense and is an intellectual embarrassment.<br /><br />*  Blood transfusions.  Like I told my JW study partner, if you're going to be radical in an interpretation of a couple of verses (Acts 15:20, 29) then you should be RADICAL.  It destroys your position to be against blood transfusions, then allow blood salvaging, dialysis, snakebite serum etc.  Once you've made these exceptions, you've given away the doctrine's raison d'être and exposed yourself to the justifiable charge of hypocrisy.<br /><br />*  Humans have spirits living independently of their bodies.  Mark 9:4.<br /><br />*  Heaven is open to all, not just 144,000.  John 3:15-16.  The 144,000 are \\"before the throne\\" of God (Rev. 14:3) just like the great multitude (Rev. 7:9, 15).<br /><br />*  Jesus resurrected with a body.  John 2:19-22, Luke 24:36-43.  If he had \\"materialized\\" a body on specific occasions after his resurrection, then he would die every time he de-materialized that body (James 2:26), and Jesus died only once.  Rom 6:9.<br /><br />*  Man CAN see God.  Exod. 24:9-11, Isa. 6:5, Amos 9:1, 1 John 3:2.<br /><br />*  The bible is not error-free.  Mat 27:9 vs. Zech. 11:12 (Matthew confuses the prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah).<br /><br />*  Jesus was BORN the Messiah, or Christ (Luke 2:11); he wasn't \\"anointed\\" the Christ upon his baptism at the age of 30.<br /><br />*  Gifts of the spirit still exist.  They will exist as long as knowledge itself exists (1 Cor. 13:8-9), and knowledge hasn't vanished yet.  Not *my* knowledge anyway.<br /><br />*  All will resurrect.  John 5:28-29 (\\"ALL that are in the graves shall hear his voice\\"), 1 Cor. 15:20-22 (\\"For as in Adam ALL die, even so in Christ shall ALL be made alive\\").<br /><br />*  People from before the time of Jesus will go to heaven.  Mat. 8:11.<br /><br />*  Jesus was crucified, not hung on a stake.  John 20:25: Thomas speaks of the print of the \\"nails\\" (note the plural), not the \\"nail\\"; had Jesus been hung on a stake, a single nail would have gone through both hands.<br /><br />*  Giants (Hebrew: \\"nephilim\\") existed after the Flood.  Num. 13:33.<br /><br />*  The second death is not the end of existence.  Mat. 25:41, 46, Rev. 14:10-11, 19:3, 20:10.t multitude (Rev. 7:9, 15).    *  Jesus resurrected with a body.  John 2:19-22, Luke 24:36-43.  If he had \\"materialized\\" a body on specific occasions after his resurrection, then he would die every time he de-materialized that body (James 2:26), and Jesus died only once.  Rom 6:9.    *  Man CAN see God.  Exod. 24:9-11, Isa. 6:5, Amos 9:1, 1 John 3:2.    *  The bible is not error-free.  Mat 27:9 vs. Zech. 11:12 (Matthew confuses the prophets Jeremiah and Zechariah).    *  Jesus was BORN the Messiah, or Christ (Luke 2:11); he wasn't \\"anointed\\" the Christ upon his baptism at the age of 30.    *  Gifts of the spirit still exist.  They will exist as long as knowledge itself exists (1 Cor. 13:8-9), and knowledge hasn't vanished yet.  Not *my* knowledge anyway.    *  All will resurrect.  John 5:28-29 (\\"ALL that are in the graves shall hear his voice\\"), 1 Cor. 15:20-22 (\\"For as in Adam ALL die, even so in Christ shall ALL be made alive\\").    *  People from before the time of Jesus will go to heaven.  Mat. 8:11.    *  Jesus was crucified, not hung on a stake.  John 20:25: Thomas speaks of the print of the \\"nails\\" (note the plural), not the \\"nail\\"; had Jesus been hung on a stake, a single nail would have gone through both hands.    *  Giants (Hebrew: \\"nephilim\\") existed after the Flood.

David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: \\"he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel\\" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).<br /><br />Such twisted thinking is evident through \\"Nations and Nationalism,\\" where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's \\"Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity\\" or Benedict Anderson's \\"Imagined Communities.\\"	2005-07-12

It was back before I had Hinkle Goldfarb as my nom de guerre.<br /><br />FALSEHOODS. Spong's most important falsehood is the book's nominal premise--its title. Christianity won't die if it doesn't change. Religions can remain static, or change minimally, and remain viable for millennia. Islam in particular comes to mind.<br /><br />Relatedly, the theistic God has not been &#34;cast aside&#34; because human beings have &#34;evolved&#34; (p 54). Positing that humans can/do/will evolve either physically or mentally in the space of a few years is an error made by many, including Marx, Lenin, Lysenko and Hegel. Theism developed due to human nature (pp 51-52), and Spong shows no evidence that the mere acquisition of knowledge changes our nature.<br /><br />INTOLERANCE. For a guy who seeking to &#34;love wastefully and abundantly,&#34; (p 68) Spong has a hell of a long way to go. He commits an unpardonable hypocrisy when he calls his critics peddlers of &#34;premodern literalizations that so frequently masquerade as Christianity&#34; (p xvi). Besides being intolerance bordering on bigotry, wouldn't you agree that Spong calling others' Christian credentials into question is a little ironic?<br /><br />SOPHISTRY. Why does Spong resist being called a pantheist or even a &#34;panentheist&#34; (p 62)? Is there really any difference between &#34;God is in, but not necessarily the sum of, all things&#34; (panenetheism) and &#34;God is the inescapable depth and center of all that is&#34; (Spongism) (p 70)?<br />And...Christianity without Christ. Think about that. Sam Kinison would have correctly pointed out that Christianity without Christ is like rock 'n roll without drugs. Spong's Jesus is not Christ. He is a &#34;spirit person&#34; (ch 7). He doesn't save (pp 179-180). He didn't atone (p 84). He will not resurrect us (p 116). I could believe an oak tree is Christ. Does that make me a Christian?<br /><br />CASUISTRY. Spong uses the new testament to make his argument that Jesus was a &#34;spirit person&#34; at the same time he belittles the primitive Christians' ability to correctly state their spiritual experiences (p 106). Spong's phony reasoning is obvious when contrasting his religious and political views. Take a look at his view of Jesus and his favorable view of abortion (p 6). In chapter 8 Spong sets forth Jesus as the alpha-exemplar of selflessness and defender of the defenseless and excluded (pp 128-9). Contrast that ideal with abortion. Abortion is almost always selfish; actually, it's difficult to think of something more selfish. It also is an act that by definition rejects (kills) the defenseless.<br /><br />TRUTH. Let's be honest. Spong breaks wide open some of Christianity's most glaring problems and fallacies. Among the best explained are: how the Enlightenment and modern science attack God (pp 31-40); how the need for religion comes from our nature instead of an external source (pp 51-52); the illogic of &#34;religious truth&#34; (p 52); the function of guilt as part of religious control (p 95); the inherent injustice of prayer (p 142); the immorality of the law of Moses (p 153); and the contemporary selective obedience to biblical laws (pp 156-158).ment to make his argument that Jesus was a &#34;spirit person&#34; at the same time he belittles the primitive Christians' ability to correctly state their spiritual experiences (p 106).

US	30095884	R2F6K0WOYKMQ7B	0446357448	839482866	Bloodline	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Gripping, salacious, suspenseful, and, oddly, motivating	Reading Sheldon's most recent book \\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\\" reminded me of this, the first book of his I read, \\"Bloodline.\\"  I still consider Bloodline to be his best work, definitely in the first order of all thrillers written.  It has it all -- beautiful heroine, exotic locales, all sort of deviancy to satisfy my prurient and adolescent mind, great plot that keeps you guessing, great characters, great psychology, and interesting insights into lifestyles of the rich and famous.<br /><br />Also, Bloodline was, strangely enough, my first great motivational book.  I read it not long after it came out, in 1979 or 1980, when I was a young teenager.  It had an effect on me as a 14-year-old that \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or \\"The Fountainhead\\" might have on a 20-year old.  The book made me think of what *my* future would be, and whether I would be up to the task of meeting that future head-on.  That is the book's greatest strength: it describes people facing adversity and succeeding despite myriad obstacles.<br /><br />There is one part of the plot that I must comment on, however.  A good capital markets attorney, even in the 1970s, could have resolved the Roffe family's cash flow problems quite easily.  Further bank loans would have been entirely unnecessary.  All that was required was to make an offering of common stock to the general public to raise the needed money, simultaneously giving the Roffe family shares of preferred stock, with the preferred stock tradeable only within the Roffe family.  The preferred stock would give the collective holders thereof majority control over the board of directors of the company, say four out of seven seats, and preference rights to receive dividends.  Presto -- the Roffe family remains in control, cash flow problems are solved, and the Roffe family taps into some big bucks.  The New York Times Company actually has something similar to this, allowing the Sulzbergers to retain control while holding only a small proportion of the outstanding stock.  See Note 15 of the financial statements to the New York Times Company's most recent Form 10-K.  Simple, no?  Sir Alec could get the money to pay off the gangsters, Ivo could pay off Donatella, Walther could afford a nice cushy asylum for Anna, and Helene could...well, do something mean and nasty I guess, and everyone would be happy, no murder or mayhem necessary.

Well, the last time I read a Sidney Sheldon book, Reagan was president.  Anyhow, I decided to pick up the book and found it enjoyable.  It's classic Sheldon, with people getting killed at exotic locales, conspiracies by smart and twisted people, and beautiful women in mortal danger.  It's no \\"Bloodline,\\" but still recommended for fans of the genre.	2005-05-31

Ms. Noonon also does the added service of admitting some of Mr. Reagan's shortcomings, such as his lack of communication skills in his first marriage and with his family.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Mr. Reagan, may peace be upon him.  I consider him the greatest president of my lifetime and probably of the twentieth century, and am happy to see his policies and beliefs vindicated not just in reality but also in public opinion.  I think the book captures the moral underpinnings of many of great things he did as president, and I'm also happy that the book expounds those great things.<br /><br />I do have some objections to the book, however.  In particular, I object to Ms. Noonon's characterization of Iran-Contra as evidence of Reagan's good character.  I would argue that Iran-Contra shows just the opposite, although not in the way the MSM cast it at the time.  No, Iran-Contra showed a defect in Reagan's character because he forgot, for a time, to put the national interest ahead of his emotions regarding a few morons who thought they were special and wouldn't be kidnapped.  Not only did Reagan do dirty business with a mortal enemy, he also contradicted American policy, lost domestic political capital, showed our enemies he could be had, and last and least encouraged more kidnappings of yet more morons.  In that sense, both Reagan's and Clinton's scandals were similar: both presidents allowed emotion to dictate their actions, contrary to the interests of the country and ultimately, themselves.  A Reagan apologist might point out that Reagan's motives for arms-for-hostages were altruistic, while Clinton's motives were venal, but on a certain level that misses the point.  In both cases, the men put their preferences ahead of the nation's, with awful results.  And -- let's face it -- the consequences of Reagan's failure turned out to be more serious than Clinton's.<br /><br />I also object to Ms. Noonon's elision regarding Reagan's character in his response to the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing.  To this day I don't understand why we didn't retaliate in full measure against Syria and Lebanon for the deaths of 243 Marines.  Instead, Reagan's lack of character led him to acquiesce to terrorists (sound familiar?) and we still live with the consequences of that acquiescence.consequences of Reagan's failure turned out to be more serious than Clinton's.

Although some of the material about womens' rights in 1820s Mexico does appear to be factual (I couldn't find anything contradicting it) its constant tone is \\"Look at how good Mexico was compared to the bad United States.\\"  It's worse than cultural relativism, it's cultural assassination, with the U.S., as always, in the cross-hairs.  Mexico didn't even fully give women the right to vote until the 1950s, for crying out loud!  Infant mortality rates were lower, and literacy rates, wealth creation and longetivity were all significantly higher, in the U.S. vis a vis Mexico in the 1820s, but you'll never hear that side of the story from this P.C. piece of dreck.	2005-05-20

On one level, this book is useful for those kids thrust into non-traditional family situations like those in HHTM.  You could do worse than have the facts of your own familial structure explained to you by a kiddie book as opposed to the schoolyard bully, d'accord?<br /><br />That said, the book is a parody of political correctness.  When Heather goes to day care (can't Heather get at least *one* stay-at-home mom?) there's only one family out of five that has a traditional mother-father family structure and a regular kid.  Despite what the Buchanan Brigades may be telling us about American culture, the norm in the U.S. is still the nuclear family.  A book reflecting that reality more clearly, rather than trying to twist reality into a PC pretzel, would have been preferred.	2005-05-19

Considering the strong Trinitarian (even Modalist) passages in the Book of Mormon from the early 1830s, and contrasting these passages with the humanist and polytheistic passages in the Pearl of Great Price and D&C 130 in the 1840s, I can see their point.  That said, Talmage's apology for Mormon beliefs as then (and currently) existing are excellent, and I have used them myself when bashing.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book as far superior in its doctrinal exposition and in its tone to Mormon Doctrine, even though its scope is necessarily more limited.	2005-05-06

Let this review be for the majority of us who don't know the difference between a \\"bildungsroman\\" and a  blitzkrieg.<br /><br />The novel is well worth the time to read because it captures so well the formation of character.  (Yes, I know that's the essence of \\"bildungsroman\\" but I'm not an English major.  I just read, and infer, from other reviews what the word means.)  What shapes us, what is knowable, what is unknowable, what will our life blueprints be and how do we acquire them, who will be our role models, and why.  For those of us who have already acquired our life blueprints, I suspect a great many of us will chuckle as we read of Philip's adventures and his evolving understanding of human nature and himself.  We have gone through life events that no doubt have been similar.  Similarly, I don't think it inauthentic for Maugham to end the book with Philip deciding to take bourgeois bliss over more foreign escapades.  I think it's just as authentic as Raskolnikov's decision to turn himself in at the end of \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"  Character and conscience lead to certain conclusions, and if a book has done a good job explaining these moral elements, then the ending dovetails with the rest of the book.<br /><br />The sole reservation I have is the introduction by Jane Smiley.  Post- election 2004 she wrote a vituperative essay on Republicans, easily the nastiest and most bigoted piece I read in the post-campaign season.  Her ability to rationally or logically discuss Maugham is suspect because she demonstrated her inability to write rationally and logically in other contexts.  So I recommend purchasing a different edition instead.	2005-05-05

However, the book is defective on a number of levels.  Let's take a look at a few of them<br /><br />CONSISTENT LOGIC.  Poor.  Any book should be internally consistent, and a polemical and ostensibly factual work *must* be consistent with outside documents as well.  Here are just a few of dozens of the book's logical lapses:<br /><br />1. Floyd can't claim he confessed to believe in Jesus at age twelve (p 14), then turn around and claim that he wasn't saved (p 19) while still preaching that all you need to do to be saved is \\"call upon the name of the Lord\\" (pp 87, 164).  So which is it?  Either calling upon Jesus works or it doesn't.  Once you start attaching strings to it, you've basically made the Mormons' case for them, since they argue -- appropriately IMHO -- that the string attached to *true* faith is works.<br /><br />2.  Floyd falls for the classic A-M logic error regarding the priesthood, stating \\"When Jesus died...the need for priests was done away with\\" and then on the *same page* stating \\"every Christian is now declared to be a priest\\" (p 99).  He couldn't even let a page go by before contradicting himself.<br /><br />3.  Floyd also falls for the logic error of asserting that the Melchizedek priesthood held by Jesus is \\"untransferable\\" and once again on the same page contradicting himself by saying that Melchizedek also held the priesthood (p 97).  Folks, if the Melchizedek priesthood is untransferable, that means either Jesus held the priesthood, or Melchizedek, but not both.  This isn't rocket science.  Also, note that Jesus was a priest after the \\"order\\" of Melchizedek.  Ps. 110:4.  Who ever heard of a priesthood \\"order\\" with only one person?  The Aaronic priesthood was also an \\"order\\" (Heb. 7:11) and had at least tens of thousands of priests.<br /><br />4.  As a dog returns to its vomit, so does Floyd to his folly, proclaiming that there can be only twelve apostles but once again on the same page saying that all believers are apostles (p 123).  Besides, should Judas Iscariot, whom Jesus called \\"a devil\\" (John 6:70), really be the foundation to the Celestial City like Floyd claims (p 123)?<br /><br />5.  There's no substitute for knowing your bible if you're writing a book heavily referencing it.  Floyd says the bible gives no qualifications for apostle (p 124).  I suggest Floyd pick up his bible, blow the dust off it, and turn to Acts 1:21-22.<br /><br />6.  Floyd states \\"the whole of 1 Corinthians 15 gives God's beautiful picture of...our own resurrection\\" (p 111) but then twists 1 Cor. 15:46 (\\"not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual\\") around like a pretzel to claim that the verse is comparing our pre-mortal vs. mortal state (p 86), rather than the contextually obvious comparison of our mortal state to our resurrected state.  Floyd needs more than a course in logic.  He needs a heavy-duty course in biblical exegesis.<br /><br />7.  Floyd also engages in subtler manipulation and contradiction.  He claims that praying for confirmation of the truthfulness of the BoM is a \\"satanic trap\\" (p 131), since sincere people will feel psychologically pressured to believe the BoM or else worry they are not asking with a \\"sincere heart\\" in accordance with Moroni 10:4.  Fair enough.  But then he states \\"[t]rue Christians do get a deep and abiding peace beyond anything else they have ever known\\" when they understand Jesus has saved them (p 141).  Is Floyd not engaging in the same psychological pressure he just criticized the Mormons for?  Isn't he implying that if you *don't* have a deep peace beyond anything you've ever known, you're not a Christian?  Floyd, which are you: scribe, Pharisee or hypocrite?<br /><br />EDITING.  Better than the 1980 edition, but still poor.  He gives a mea culpa for being fooled by Dee Jay Nelson in this edition (p 56), which is good.  But other poor editing abounds.  He tells us that Marvin Cowan is \\"a Baptist missionary to the Mormons he loves and for whom his heart aches\\" on page 104, then ten pages later tells us that Marvin Cowan \\"serves as a missionary to the Mormons.\\"  Telling us once would have been enough.  The verse stating \\"for I am God, and not man\\" is Hosea 11:9, not Hosea 1:9 (p 92).  Likewise, there is no Rev. 1:46 (p 211).  These are not confidence builders in Floyd's book!<br /><br />AS APOLOGY.  Not good.  The book has virtually no rebuttal for some of Mormonism's strongest scriptures, such as John 17:20-23, Luke 2:52 and Mat. 3:16-17 (re the Godhead), Mat. 27:9 and Zech 11:12 (re errancy of the bible), Acts 2:38 (re baptism), Rev. 3:14 (re Jesus as elder brother), Rev. 3:21 (re becoming gods).  The books \\"Mormons Answered Verse By Verse\\" and \\"Reasoning from the Scriptures With Mormons\\" at least take a stab at responding to several Mormon-friendly scriptures.  Floyd makes little such attempt.<br /><br />AS HISTORICAL RECORD.  Poor.  To bolster his case, Floyd throws the kitchen sink at the Mormons, using scriptures, pamphlets, newspaper articles and even affidavits.  A lot of these sources are of suspect quality and/or are rehashes of other A-M literature.  In fact, there is not a single primary source referenced in this book, other than Floyd's febrile conversations with various Mormons, and occasional chats with other A-Ms.<br /><br />AS A POLEMIC.  Good.  The book has its sneering and sarcasm down cold.  When Floyd has a supposed LDS member saying he belongs to \\"the Latter-day Saints Church\\" (p 14), you know what you're in for.  You can't say you weren't warned.  His mock sympathy for Mormons (\\"We sympathize with their heartbreak over what the following facts will reveal\\") (p 28) is truly hilarious for someone with a twisted sense of humor like me.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY.  Overall, this book does a lot of the low-level dirty work of A-M literature, hurling everything it can at Mormons, like Alma 7:10 (p 37), angels of light (pp 32, 133), inhabitants on the moon (p 37), Adam-God (p 77), false prophets (p 187), \\"god of this world\\" (p 176), etc.  But I suppose someone has to do the dirty work, and that's Floyd's shtick.  For the interested reader however, I think in terms of consistency and intellectual heft, \\"Reasoning from the Scriptures With Mormons,\\" although itself flawed, is a better value.\\"a Baptist missionary to the Mormons he loves and for whom his heart aches\\" on page 104, then ten pages later tells us that Marvin Cowan \\"serves as a missionary to the Mormons.\\"  Telling us once would have been enough.

US	30095884	R2J5JZWYVKCI6B	1565073282	516160198	Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons	Books	3	34	53	N	Y	Uneven and incomplete	Ron Rhodes does many things right in this book. It has some pretty good doctrinal discussions and bible-centered responses to mainstream Mormon doctrines. That said, it has some of the classic drawbacks of anti-Mormon (\\"A-M\\") literature and avoids responding to some of the toughest pro-Mormon biblical scriptures. Here is a brief review of the book by chapters.<br /><br />Chapter 3 (\\"The Restored Church?\\") provides a generally good response to the biblical verses Mormons use to claim that a total apostasy occurred.  However, Mr. Rhodes needs to expend a little more time and energy to find neutral, academic sources for his extra-biblical critiques of Mormon doctrine. Citing to other A-Ms (Farkas and Reed, Tanners, W. Martin, McKeever, etc.) is intellectually unbecoming.  WILLING OMISSION ALERT: Mr. Rhodes provides no response to several pro-apostasy verses such as Isa. 11:11, Dan. 2:44, Amos 8:11-13 and 1 John 2:18-19.<br /><br />Chapter 4 (\\"True Prophets of God?\\"), which addresses Mormon prophecies and church structure, is unconvincing. Mr. Rhodes' response to 1 Cor. 12:28 is to claim that prophets no longer exist in the traditional sense (pp 72, 79). This claim might surprise many sects with which Mr. Rhodes claims fellowship, who still believe in the gift of prophecy along with other spiritual gifts (Eph. 4:11-13).<br /><br />Mr. Rhodes likewise falls short in his explanation of a lack of need for new apostles (p 73), considering the fact that the new testament shows several new apostles being ordained. WILLING OMISSION ALERT: Mr. Rhodes cites only one of the two tests for apostleship -- seeing Jesus -- and uses that to make his case there can be no new apostles, but ignores the other test -- that an apostle be a person \\"which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us\\" -- that would puncture his argument because it is a test under Mr. Rhodes' interpretation of the verse that the apostle Paul clearly would have failed. See Acts 1:21-22.<br /><br />Mr. Rhodes is similarly shortsighted in claiming that because the foundation to the celestial city mentions twelve apostles (Rev. 21:14) that this necessarily means there can only be twelve apostles (p 74). Under his reasoning, not only would Paul, Barnabus and Matthias *not* be apostles, Judas Iscariot *would* be a foundation to the celestial city. Yikes!<br /><br />As an aside, note that Mr. Rhodes gets his date wrong on the appearance of the Salamander Letter (p 69). It was late 1983, not 1980. Get your facts straight, Mr. Rhodes.<br /><br />Chapters 5-6 (the Book of Mormon) are uneven. The author has some good material, such as a well-done rebuttal to purported Book of Mormon prophecies in Isa. 29:1-4 (pp 92-98) and Ezek. 37:16-17 (pp 101-103). By not overextending himself on Rev. 22:18, he also puts forth a good case that the JST version of the bible violated that verse (pp 111-113, 144).<br /><br />However, Mr. Rhodes' analysis of James 1:5 falls short (pp 105-111). I have never understood why A-Ms object so vehemently to the Mormons' straightforward interpretation of this verse, which also meshes with the injunction of Jesus in Mat. 7:9-11 (ask God for something and like a good father he will grant it).<br /><br />Chapters 7-10 (bible inerrancy) are weak. According to Mr. Rhodes, simply because a book is cited in the bible doesn't mean it was supposed to be included (p 140). Oh? He seems to be working backward from a conclusion. Mr. Rhodes previously cited Jer. 30:2 for the principle that inspired written words are scripture (p 91), but somehow, the book of Nathan the prophet (1 Chron. 29:29) is not?  Call me simpliste, but that seems a tad inconsistent.<br /><br />I also got a laff out of Mr. Rhodes' table of fulfilled bible prophecies (pp 157-158). He would have had difficulty maintaining the fiction of biblical inerrancy when comparing Mat. 27:9 and Zech 11:12 (Matthew mistakes Jeremiah for Zechariah), so he glosses that over by referencing a more opaque Matthew verse (Mat. 26:15) and comparing it to Zech. 11:12, at the expense of the clearer Mat. 27:9.<br /><br />Chapter 11 (migration to the Americas and the other sheep) was adequate. Mr. Rhodes does a satisfactory job rebutting the Mormon interpretation of John 10:16, although he doesn't directly address the \\"hear my voice\\" issue.<br /><br />Chapter 12 (the Melchizedek priesthood) was poorly thought-out and unfocused. Mr. Rhodes' discussion of Melchizedek seems to be more an argument against some of his co-religionists, rather than against Mormons (pp 199-208).  His alchemy for turning the priesthood of Jesus (Heb. 7:24) from the KJV's \\"unchangeable\\" into \\"untransferable\\" is to hunt for a preacher who says so (p 210).  I guess when Mr. Rhodes said that when talking with Mormons one should \\"use only the King James Version of the bible\\" (p 35) he really meant to add \\"...except when it's convenient not to.\\"  Besides, if the priesthood were untransferable, then how did Melchizedek come to hold it? Hmm? Then, after telling us there is no more Levitical Priesthood and we cannot share in the Melchizedek priesthood (pp 213-215), Mr. Rhodes commits the classic A-M blunder of asserting \\"all who personally place their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ are 'priests'\\" (p 216).  Am I missing something?  Is there some other priesthood I don't know about?<br /><br />Chapters 13-15 (nature of God) have Mr. Rhodes struggling, mostly unsuccessfully, with various scriptures regarding God's nature.  He tries to explain away the visibility of God by saying that when God spoke to Moses \\"face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend\\" that just meant God was speaking to Moses \\"clearly and openly\\" (p 224), not that God was actually talking to Moses like one friend actually talks to another.  I ask you: which interpretation is more literal and straightforward? I guess when Mr. Rhodes counsels us to employ \\"a literal method of interpreting scriptures\\" (p 181) he really meant to add \\"...except when it's convenient not to.\\"  Then he tries to shore up this hermeneutical sandcastle by pointing out that God refers to himself as a bird in Ps. 91:4 (p 224).  Therefore, by some magic, that means Exod. 33:11 must be figurative too?  Mr. Rhodes needs to read his own book, where he classifies the Psalms in the genre of biblical \\"poetry\\" and counsels \\"[t]he wise interpreter allows his knowledge of genres to control how he approaches each individual biblical text\\" (pp 180-181).  So we should interpret historical narrative (Exodus) with poetry (Psalms)?  Physician, heal thyself!  Also, Mr. Rhodes later apparently forgets his position on this issue and states \\"Isaiah saw the Lord God Almighty seated on a throne\\" (p 304).<br /><br />Anyhow, on to other items.  How does Mr. Rhodes come to the conclusion from Isa. 31:3 that God \\"is formless\\" (p 230)?  Also, Mr. Rhodes' chief explanation for the plurality of Gods in Gen. 1:26-27 (\\"let *us* make man in *our* image\\") is that Queen Victoria did it as well (p 248).  This explanation is unsatisfactory to say the least, but when you don't have the bible to back you up, I suppose you gotta go with something.<br /><br />On the trinity, if all three members of the trinity always had omniscience as Mr. Rhodes claims (p 258), how is that the Jesus is described as having *increased* in wisdom (Luke 2:52)?  I was likewise mystified by Mr. Rhodes' analysis of Mat. 3:16-17 (the baptism of Jesus, with God the Father calling from heaven and the Holy Ghost descending like a dove on Jesus).  The main thrust of his argument is that God is not three *personages* in one God, but rather \\"three persons in one Godhead\\" (p 255).  Excuse my confusion, but isn't this the Mormon position?  WILLING OMISSION ALERT: where is Mr. Rhodes' rebuttal to the Mormons' position that John 17:20-23 demonstrates a unity of purpose and not physical being?  Any discussion Mr. Rhodes has on the nature of the trinity that doesn't address these versesis going to be, to a certain extent, a straw man.<br /><br />Chapter 16 (the pre-existence) is poor.  In his attempt to explain away Jer. 1:5, Mr. Rhodes admits that the verse \\"speaks of God calling and setting apart Jeremiah before he was born\\" but then Mr. Rhodes also states \\"the verse says nothing about Jeremiah pre-existing in any state whatsoever\\" (p 299).  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if God calls you and sets you apart, does that not *necessarily* mean you exist in some fashion?<br /><br />Mr. Rhodes also misapplies 1 Cor. 15:46 to the first and second stages of our existence (pre-mortal and mortal life), when the verse and the whole chapter of 1 Cor. 15 speaks to our second and third stages (mortal life and resurrection).  WILLING OMISSION ALERT: nowhere in the chapter does Mr. Rhodes take on the tough pro-Mormon scriptures such as Job 38:4-7 or, if you're hung up on who the \\"sons of God\\" are, Prov. 8:27-31 (sons of men were with Wisdom in the pre-existence).<br /><br />Chapters 17-20 (salvation in Mormonism) is uneven.  Mr. Rhodes does a decent job refuting Mat. 5:48 (pp 313-316), but a poor job of trying to explain why baptism is unnecessary and why baptism for the remission of sins does not exist, when the bible clearly states it does (Acts 2:38) (his argument is essentially a word play on the word \\"for\\" in Acts 2:38 (pp 327-329)).  His analyses of John 3:5 and Mark 16:16 are likewise unconvincing.  In Mark 16:16 in particular, his response to \\"he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved\\" is to sic the second clause of that verse on the first (p 332).  That's hardly harmonious scripture interpretation, I think you'll agree.<br /><br />There's more word play in Mr. Rhodes' analysis of James 2:24, 26 and the need for good works.  Mr. Rhodes proclaims \\"a person is justified by faith alone\\" (p 335).  Too bad for Mr. Rhodes the scripture actually states \\"by works a man is justified, and not by faith only\\" (James 2:24).  Nothing like flat-out contradiction of scripture, is there?<br /><br />Regarding the spirit world, I'll give Mr. Rhodes his props for tackling 1 Pet. 3:18-19, although his response is to essentially argue that the scripture should be ignored in favor of other scriptures (pp 352-353).  He tries to make Heb. 9:27 (\\"it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment\\") do too much.  Nowhere in this verse can you extract the idea that \\"immediately following the moment of death comes judgment\\" (p 353), particularly when the bible says the final judgment occurs only at the end of the Millennium (Rev. 20:2, 11-12).<br /><br />Overall, Mr. Rhodes certainly compiled a more detailed book than Messrs. Reed and Farkas, and the book provides an interested reader such as myself a good bang for the buck.  However, the book is too uneven and internally inconsistent in its analyses to be considered ultimately worthwhile.  Like Messrs. Reed's and Farkas' book, it is convincing only to those who already are convinced, but no more.sandcastle by pointing out that God refers to himself as a bird in Ps. 91:4 (p 224).  Therefore, by some magic, that means Exod. 33:11 must be figurative too?  Mr. Rhodes needs to read his own book, where he classifies the Psalms in the genre of biblical \\"poetry\\" and counsels \\"[t]he wise interpreter allows his knowledge of genres to control how he approaches each individual biblical text\\" (pp 180-181).  So we should interpret historical narrative (Exodus) with poetry (Psalms)?  Physician, heal thyself!  Also, Mr. Rhodes later apparently forgets his position on this issue and states \\"Isaiah saw the Lord God Almighty seated on a throne\\" (p 304).    Anyhow, on to other items.  How does Mr. Rhodes come to the conclusion from Isa. 31:3 that God \\"is formless\\" (p 230)?  Also, Mr. Rhodes' chief explanation for the plurality of Gods in Gen. 1:26-27 (\\"let *us* make man in *our* image\\") is that Queen Victoria did it as well (p 248).  This explanation is unsatisfactory to say the least, but when you don't have the bible to back you up, I suppose you gotta go with something.    On the trinity, if all three members of the trinity always had omniscience as Mr. Rhodes claims (p 258), how is that the Jesus is described as having *increased* in wisdom (Luke 2:52)?  I was likewise mystified by Mr. Rhodes' analysis of Mat. 3:16-17 (the baptism of Jesus, with God the Father calling from heaven and the Holy Ghost descending like a dove on Jesus).  The main thrust of his argument is that God is not three *personages* in one God, but rather \\"three persons in one Godhead\\" (p 255).  Excuse my confusion, but isn't this the Mormon position?  WILLING OMISSION ALERT: where is Mr. Rhodes' rebuttal to the Mormons' position that John 17:20-23 demonstrates a unity of purpose and not physical being?  Any discussion Mr. Rhodes has on the nature of the trinity that doesn't address these verses is going to be, to a certain extent, a straw man.    Chapter 16 (the pre-existence) is poor.  In his attemptto explain away Jer. 1:5, Mr. Rhodes admits that the verse \\"speaks of God calling and setting apart Jeremiah before he was born\\" but then Mr. Rhodes also states \\"the verse says nothing about Jeremiah pre-existing in any state whatsoever\\" (p 299).  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but if God calls you and sets you apart, does that not *necessarily* mean you exist in some fashion?

US	30095884	R1XZ3R3P1X0HN0	0801077613	924624249	Mormons Answered Verse by Verse	Books	2	10	18	N	N	Lightweight	For those of you looking for a strong, bible-based response to Mormon interpretation of the scriptures, this book falls short, dramatically short.  David Reed and John Farkas provide frustratingly few point-by-point responses to Mormon bible-based argument, and not enough consistency or sound reasoning in the responses they do provide.  A few points about the book:<br /><br />*  The book's purported focus -- Mormons answered \\"verse by verse\\" is not fulfilled.  First, the book is only 154 pages long.  Of those pages, only a skimpy 67 (pp 37-103) actually take on Mormon bible-based doctrines.  That's not nearly enough for a real \\"verse by verse\\" response.<br /><br />*  Related to the above point, the book glosses over or ignores some of the most powerful biblical verses that support Mormon doctrines.  Messrs. Reed and Farkas do not even address the Mormon interpretation of John 17:20-23 (the Intercessory Prayer, where Jesus prays that the believers be \\"one; as thou Father art in me and I in thee\\") which provides a solid justification for the Mormon concept of three beings acting as \\"one,\\" and therefore considered to be \\"one God.\\"  The authors likewise give short shrift to Mat. 3:16-17 (the baptism of Jesus, where God speaks from heaven and the Holy Ghost descends on Jesus \\"like a dove,\\" which Mormons use to claim a separation of Father, Son and Holy Ghost).  Their response to this scripture?  The Mormons' \\"off-target argument will have no effect on Christians who *know* the God they worship\\" and \\"[i]f the unsuspecting householder finds his faith shaken by such arguments it [is because] he started out with a popular misconception in his own mind rather than with sound Christian theology\\"  (p 67).  In other words, they have no real response at all except for blaming the reader for being ill-informed or dumb.<br /><br />*  The authors are also sometimes mendacious in their answering method.  Switching translations of the bible to get the words you seek is a lot like bumping the roulette wheel if the ball doesn't fall into the hole you want.  Their approach to conclude that the priesthood of Jesus is \\"a priesthood that needs no successor\\" is to hunt for a translation that says so (p 43).  Having fumbled my way through the original Greek, I can assure you that Heb. 7:24 says no such thing.  The most accurate translation of the KJV's \\"unchangeable\\" is \\"inviolable.\\"<br /><br />*  The book spends way too much time addressing obscure topics like \\"Adam-God\\" (pp 22, 59-62, 126) at the expense of more relevant ones.  Things like \\"Adam-God\\" are a wild goose chase.  If you confront a Mormon with an accusation that he believes Adam is our God, he will look you straight in the eye and say truthfully \\"No I don't.\\"  Trust me, it's a blind alley and the authors really should know better than to waste their effort on it.  Likewise the hyperventilating over how Mary conceived Jesus (pp 65-66, 68-70).  If, as the Trinitarians say, the Holy Ghost is God, and God the Father is God, why should they get the vapors if Mormons say God the Father is the father of Jesus?  The authors don't even bother to respond to scriptures like Rom. 15:6, which state plainly that is the case.<br /><br />*  The authors also make unintentional admissions, some of which are hilarious.  They actually admit that the Mormon doctrine of premortal life (Jer. 1:5, Prov. 8:1, 27-31) \\"is indeed logical from a human perspective\\" (p 57).  And what, if I may be so bold as to ask, is the authors' perspective?  Are they not human?  They read the same bible as the Mormons.  Aren't they arguing basically \\"we're right because we're right\\"?  What kind of lame-o argument is that?  I actually laughed out loud when I read it.<br /><br />*  The authors also have a low knowledge base (i.e., they're ignorant) about certain aspects of both the bible and Mormon doctrines.  For example, when referring to the priesthood of Melchizedek, they claim \\"[t]here is no evidence, biblical or otherwise, that Jesus Christ passed on this priesthood to anyone\\" (p 43).  Besides the 1.1 billion Roman Catholics (not to mention 300 million Orthodox) who would disagree with that statement, the authors ignore the Mormon doctrine that the apostles received the sealing power (Mat. 18:18) and were sent forth with the Melchizedek priesthood in John 20:21-22.  Similarly, when the authors state \\"there is nothing in the bible about 'perfect' humans progressing to Godhood\\" (p 68) they seem to be blissfully unaware of (and as a consequence fail to respond to) verses such as Mat. 25:45-47, 2 Pet. 1:4, 1 John 3:1-2 and Rev. 3:21, 21:7.<br /><br />*  Anyone purporting to show another's errors had better make sure their own **** is squared away.  If Messrs. Reed and Farkas wish to argue that the priesthood of Jesus \\"needs no successor\\" (p 43) they are perfectly free to do so; likewise, they are free to argue that all believers are \\"a royal priesthood\\" (p 98).  They cannot, however, argue both.  This sort of illogic and interpretive inconsistency kills any confidence the reader might otherwise have in the authors' knowledge base and analytical capabilities.<br /><br />However, the book does have *some* good points.  Messrs. Reed's and Farkas' exposition on how Moses could speak to God \\"face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend\\" (Exod. 33:11) (pp 47-48), yet not really see God, is pretty good, considering how weak their position is.  They also do an effective job of refuting the claim that the Book of Mormon is being referred to in Ezek. 37:16-17, and pointing out that the Book of Mormon is questionable indeed if Isa. 29:4, 11 applies to it (pp 55-56).  Their argument regarding Rev. 22:18 and changes made within Revelation itself, as opposed to mere inclusion of additional scriptures (p 103), is fresh, coherent and spot-on.  Their discussion of flaws and inconsistencies in the Book of Mormon (pp 105-120) was also solid and well-done, even foregoing the usual Alma 7:10 \\"at Jerusalem\\" baloney.<br /><br />Overall, the book is good enough for Christians looking to confirm their beliefs.  However, it is unpersuasive to an objective inquirer into the scriptures, and cannot even come close to changing the mind of a knowledgeable Mormon.otherwise, that Jesus Christ passed on this priesthood to anyone\\" (p 43).

He seems to think that we, the readers, will fall all over ourselves to ascribe \\"genius\\" to African civilizations merely on his say-so and out of fear of being perceived as non-P.C.  Uh-uh; no way. We are past that point.  Examine Mr. Davidson's own book critically and the truth becomes obvious: pre-Islamic African cultures in general fall well short of the cultures of Europe, Asia, and the New World.  Proof of this includes the following.<br /><br />(1)  Pre-Islamic Africa was \\"anti-scientific\\" (p. 59).<br /><br />(2)  Knowledge was not accumulated from generation to generation (p. 59), mainly because pre-Islamic Africans were illiterate (pp 28-9, 222, 257).<br /><br />(3)  The ideal tribal organization was \\"static\\" (p. 55).<br /><br />(4)  Beliefs and actions of Africans were \\"irrational\\" and \\"ghost-ridden\\" (p. 80).<br /><br />(5)  New African dynasties rewrote or suppressed their histories (p. 115).  Now we must admit that European, Asian, and New World dynasties have done this too, but it's hardly the mark of \\"genius.\\"<br /><br />(6)  \\"The moral order was robustly collective\\" in pre-Islamic African societies (p. 70), and \\"individuals might have rights, but they had them only by virtue of the obligations they fulfilled to the community\\" (p. 57).<br /><br />All this points to a people who had no basis in science, no scientific method, no permanent knowledge or institutional learning, and no path to betterment.<br /><br />What is even more frustrating, however, is Mr. Davidson's apologetics and elision over uncomfortable aspects of African culture.  Here are some examples.<br /><br />(a)  Mr. Davidson willingly omits descriptions of \\"female circumcision\\" (p. 172), which is a barbaric, anti-woman practice, and seen through a feminist critique, is merely a ritual designed to enforce patriarchy.<br /><br />(b)  Mr. Davidson makes no mention of infanticide as a method of birth control or the widespread practice of twin infanticide (see \\"Things Fall Apart\\" for an interesting discussion on this point).<br /><br />(c)  Mr. Davidson makes no mention of the practice of human sacrifice, often by horrible means, that accompanied some of Africa's larger civilizations (for a brief discussion of this in the Nigerian-Benin context, see \\"Lugard--Years of Adventure\\").<br /><br />And after failing to mention all this, Davidson claims that pre-Islamic Africa was \\"materially simple but not morally defenceless\\" (p. 67). Oh?<br /><br />Additionally, Mr. Davidson turns from scholar to apologist in this book. Apparently to show that African cultures are not so far behind European cultures, he gives us a mini-exegesis on the witch hunts in England and Scotland (pp. 124-5), then shows us the irrationality of Italian Catholics (p. 176).  He bemoans the fact that European (and I suppose American) culture invented nuclear weapons (pp. 114-5) and degrades the importance of science in the modern world (p. 115). This is part of \\"The African Genius\\"?  Nonsense--it's pure apology, and contributes nothing to Mr. Davidson's supposed thesis of the greatness of Africans. Are we to believe that Africans are geniuses because they failed to build complicated weapons?  If so, then Mr. Davidson will have an uncomfortable time explaining Rwanda 1994, when low-tech weapons like sticks and machetes were used to kill more people than all nuclear weapons ever have.<br /><br />Mr. Davidson needs to realize and then address the problems that existed, and still exist in African culture: kleptocracy, low standard of living, human rights abuses, tribalism. He cannot sweepingly say that because a culture is unique and ancient that somehow it is \\"genius.\\" That is intellectually dishonest and paternalistic, and paternalism is only one step removed from racism.actice of twin infanticide (see \\"Things Fall Apart\\" for an interesting discussion on this point).<br /><br />(c)  Mr. Davidson makes no mention of the practice of human sacrifice, often by horrible means, that accompanied some of Africa's larger civilizations (for a brief discussion of this in the Nigerian-Benin context, see \\"Lugard--Years of Adventure\\").<br /><br />And after failing to mention all this, Davidson claims that pre-Islamic Africa was \\"materially simple but not morally defenceless\\" (p. 67).

He includes overviews of the financial, economic and psychological foundations for stock markets, as well as entertaining summaries of the history of stock markets in the world and in the U.S.  Mr. Malkiel takes a sensible, long-term approach to investing with stocks and bonds, at the same time pouring cold water on various market theories.  He approvingly quotes the phrase \\"the stock market is like a casino in which the odds are rigged in favor of the player\\" which is probably the best summing-up I've ever encountered when thinking about stocks.  Some of his more salient and direct advice includes these gems:<br /><br />*  \\"A simple 'buy-and-hold' strategy typically makes as much or more money than technical strategies\\" (p 151).<br /><br />*  \\"No technical scheme whatever could work for any length of time and ...even if they did work, the schemes would be bound to destroy themselves\\" (p 167).<br /><br />*  Regularities in stock market movements are arbitraged away over time; whoever spots such a regularity would not tell everyone else, but instead would keep it to him- or herself to get rich (p 168).<br /><br />*  Many analysts are incompetent or are compromised by institutional conflicts of interest (pp 181, 183).<br /><br />*  \\"The evidence from several studies is remarkably uniform.  Investors have done no better with the average mutual fund than they could have done by purchasing and holding an unmanaged broad stock index\\" (p 187).<br /><br />*  Don't ignore small cap companies: \\"smaller firms tend to have higher rates of return\\" (p 239).<br /><br />*  Investors should look for stocks with relatively low P/E ratios and low values relative to their book values (pp 239, 261).<br /><br />*  The only market-timing strategy that makes any empirical sense is to purchase stocks that have had relatively poor recent performance (p 257).<br /><br />*  The stock market goes through manias but is fundamentally logical (p 258).<br /><br />*  Your tolerance for risk should be judged by how well you can sleep at night with your portfolio (p 280).<br /><br />*  Zero coupon bonds can be a good investment if the tax aspects are adequately addressed (p 299).<br /><br />*  \\"I recommend low-expense bond index funds\\" (p 300).<br /><br />*  \\"I now believe that if an investor is to buy one U.S. index fund, the best general U.S. index to emulate is the broader Wilshire 5,000-Stock Index, not the S&P 500\\" (p 360).<br />*  The stock market goes through manias but is fundamentally logical (p 258).  <br /> <br />*  Your tolerance for risk should be judged by how well you can sleep at night with your portfolio (p 280).  <br /> <br />*  Zero coupon bonds can be a good investment if the tax aspects are adequately addressed (p 299).  <br /> <br />*  \\"I recommend low-expense bond index funds\\" (p 300).  <br /> <br />*  \\"I now believe that if an investor is to buy one U.S. index fund, the best general U.S. index to emulate is the broader Wilshire 5,000-Stock Index, not the S&P 500\\" (p 360).	2005-01-31
US	30095884	R2L09NZCPOX37	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	4	1	5	N	N	The first is the best	This is Stephenson's first work, and it shows in all the right ways.  There's a sense of exhilaration and freshness that doesn't come through in his other books.  Moreover, he obviously had been thinking about some of his most memorable lines and thoughts for years and they all come out here.  From a fragmente on comparative advantage on pages 5 and 6 so good that it's quoted approvingly in \\"The Economist\\" to a description of federal workers required to read a three-page memorandum on toilet paper, this book covers the gamut of the zany, the bizarre and the hilarious.<br /><br />And when he gets down to the plot, he has a pretty solid foundation.  So much writing in SF's \\"cyberpunk\\" phase was just existential angst and leftover hippie-ism.  Writers dispensed with plots and concentrated on attitude, which will only get a reader so far.  Snow Crash, on the other hand, had an important point to make about the origins, costs and benefits of human interconnectivity, and was able to present the point intelligently and interestingly, even making the pedantic parts (i.e., the Librarian) fun to read.  I don't exactly agree with Stephenson's characterization of the origins of Judaic thought, which seems to be based on an ad hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, but at least he's talking about interesting and thought-provoking things.  I never learned more from any other source about Sumerian history.<br /><br />My only reservation about the book is its glaring inaccuracy about \\"speaking in tongues\\" both in the biblical context and as a linguistic phenomenon.  First, a careful review of the biblical verses relating to the Day of Pentecost reveals that the languages spoken were known languages understandable to those gathered: \\"And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?\\"  Acts 2:8.  On the linguistic side, glossalia has been examined and it has been determined to be an artifact of a mind already developed by language.  Examination of the choice of syllables and formation sounds and words of \\"speaking in tongues\\" used by the Pentecostals will reveal the native tongue of the speaker and even which part of the country he or she is from.  See \\"Word Play\\" by Peter Farb.  These facts vitiate Stephenson's principal argument.and formation sounds and words of \\"speaking in tongues\\" used by the Pentecostals will reveal the native tongue of the speaker and even which part of the country he or she is from.

Instead, he lists several items, such as rental property, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, business partnerships with limited involvement, promissory notes and royalties (p. 89), that generate money and should be invested in.<br /><br />* Don't get into large debt positions for non-necessities.  Buy your luxury items for cash (p. 176).  This is part of any sound financial planning and is taken to its logical endpoint by the authors of \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\"<br /><br />* Watch out for the tax effect of your sales of real estate.  In this sense, the book is out of date, since the tax laws were changed in the late 90s to permit up to $250,000 in capital gains ($500,000 for married couples) from the sale of a primary residence be exempt from federal tax, under certain circumstances.  No longer must you rely on the 1031 \\"trading up\\" provision he describes, at least not exclusively.<br /><br />* Fear can be utilized as a great motivator to act, as opposed to fear causing you to be a deer in the headlights of life.<br /><br />However, before we all run off to leverage real estate to become gentlepeople of leisure, let's try to remember a few things.<br /><br />* This book is written for one reason: to be earn the author money.  Kiyosaki is even somewhat up-front about it, noting that royalties are one of the best assets for a person to have (p. 89).  Therefore, you should be skeptical -- not cynical but merely skeptical -- about the advice he gives.<br /><br />* For every Kiyosaki there's a multiple of people who crashed and burned in stock and real estate speculation, and the difference between the author and those people is due in some measure to chance.<br /><br />* It is much easier to invest in undervalued, illiquid assets in downturns when you're already sitting on a pile of cash.<br /><br />* Dropping our current jobs to do Kiyosaki's kind of analysis and investing does not make sense for most of us.  After all, our jobs are, in Kiyosaki's sense, an \\"asset\\" because they generate positive cash flow.<br /><br />* The principle of \\"paying yourself first\\" (p. 172) is not something to be applied inflexibly.  Kiyosaki is giving everyone advice from a position that may not be applicable to everyone (p. 176).  Yes, the idea of saving a portion of your income is a good idea, even an outstanding idea.  But stiffing the tax man and your creditors is not, and unless you operate a business or are engaged in a profession where you can rapidly earn extra cash, it's not a good idea to try to scare yourself into coming up with a brilliant plan to pay them off.  You might wind up with a solution like George Segal and Jane Fonda in \\"Fun With Dick and Jane.\\"<br /><br />* Beware the author's personal biases.  If he truly believed that America is \\"on the course\\" to collapsing because the difference between the haves and have-nots is widening (p. 48), he'd be investing in foreign real estate, in gold and would hold a lot of money in cash.  He's not.  In fact, he does the exact opposite.  He bets on American's long-term stability by purchasing real estate.<br /><br />* The author casually talks about extremely risky investments, such as $5,000 investments returning $1,000,000, as if these were almost ordinary (p. 78).  That's highly misleading.  He does mention in the book that out of ten limited investments, a preponderance of his business investments \\"go nowhere\\" or completely fail, but that should be highlighted when those stratospheric returns are mentioned.<br /><br />Overall, Kiyosaki has some good advice.  However, do not think that you are likely to duplicate his personal experience to success.  If you look at how he made his money, he essentially got rich holding real estate in the 70s, in Hawaii, as well as being one of the state's best salesmen.  He was at the right place at the right time, with a particular important skill.  He then had sufficient money in the 80s and 90s to be able to invest in real estate in the economic downturns.  So his position does not correspond to most of ours.are mentioned. <br /> <br />Overall, Kiyosaki has some good advice.

Although this book is good, we've come to expect better from Heinlein.<br /><br />But still, Heilein was on to something, particularly the examination of humanity from the outsider's perspective. That idea sustains this book, when otherwise the plot would merely wallow in the author's idiosyncratic views of sex, religion, and government.	2004-10-08
US	30095884	RA485UFBHKRYF	055380250X	303170656	The Taking	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Tim Lahaye meets Stephen King	This is a decent read, and typical of Koontz' recent offerings.  I sped-read most of the book, which is just as well.  Nowadays I know Koontz' books so well I figure I am required to read carefully until the first time the word \\"ululate\\" or its variant appears.  Since \\"ululation\\" appeared on page 10, that meant I sped-read most of the book.<br /><br />I really can't argue with Mr. Koontz' eschatology because, let's face it, the field is wide-open to interpretation, as it has been for the past two thousand years.  I figured out the theological twist not by breaking the code of the space station phrase (too hard!) but by the conversation with Molly's brother-in-law in Hawaii, in which a biblical chapter 12 verse 12 is mentioned.  I figured it would be in Revelations, and I was right.  So gimme a gold star.<br /><br />The book also gives the phrase \\"for the children\\" a whole new meaning.  Mr. Koontz attempts to explain the suffering of children and he doesn't quite succeed. He explains how evil is prohibited from harming children but beings with free will are not.  Fine.  But what about children who are harmed by \\"acts of God,\\" accidents and disease?  No answer there.  The closest Koontz has ever come to answering those questions in my mind is in \\"Cold Fire\\" when Jim Ironheart has a theological conversation with Father Geary.<br /><br />Also, since Koontz is the one who decided to dive into a stealth theology lecture, I must point out one other thing.  Koontz seems to be saying that Hope is the greatest of all human thoughts or emotions.  As a fan of \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" I agree, but this is at variance with scripture.  1 Cor. 13:13 says that Charity (Love in newer translations) is the greatest.	2004-10-05

We all can cite examples of each.  De Soto  essentially argues that in developed countries real property is effectively leveraged (it leads a \\"parallel life\\") through mortgaging to provide start-up capital for entrepreneurs.  It's an interesting thesis, and one that empirically he demonstrates quite well.<br /><br />But the book is more than just that one key insight into secured financing.  In chapter 3, De Soto becomes his most philosophical, asking and attempting to answer the question \\"What *is* capital?\\"  This is a question that at first blush appears easy to answer, but is not.  And although Mr. De Soto is largely correct in his answer, he appears to fumble somewhat in describing it.  Capital is trust.  Money is trust that a piece of paper can be exchanged for an equivalent amount of goods or services in the future.  A mortgage is trust that if money is not paid that a tangible asset can be sold and the money repaid.  Even more exotic financial instruments are merely manifestations of trust; for example, a derivative is trust that the value of a contract will either increase or decrease, and that amounts arising from that contract will be paid to the derivative holder.<br /><br />This is where De Soto overplays his hand.  Yes, property rights are key to having a developed mortgage market, which is then key to wealth creation by borrowing against real property to engage in business ventures.  But there are other factors as well, factors related to the creation and retention of trust, and therefore of capital, that De Soto does mention but underplays.  Things like the speed and certainty of the underlying legal system, bankruptcy laws and corruption.  There are also more generic issues such as a country's or culture's general entrepreneurial character, and attitude towards education.  As a sometimes-resident and devoted fan of one Latin American country, I can attest to the fact that the reformation of key institutions and a general change in cultural attitudes towards corruption and education can take decades.  So even though De Soto has grabbed the elephant's trunk, he's not paying sufficient attention to the rest of it.country, I can attest to the fact that the reformation of key institutions and a general change in cultural attitudes towards corruption and education can take decades.

He's created an interesting, if somewhat juvenile and cartoonish, lead character (Mr. Hel reminds me of no one so much as the hilarious Col. Flagg of M*A*S*H, who in one scene holds his index finger up to Charles Winchester and says \\"Do you believe I could kill you with this finger?\\"), and runs us through some beautiful curves and contours of Japanese culture. But really. Here in the 21st century, post-Oliver Stone, post-X Files, this book's paranoia with the Corporation That Runs The World is remarkable only in its prediction of how other slick hacks 25 years later would try to convince us that They control us.  Trevanian's view of modern corporate society in this book is roughly equivalent to Michael Moore's: fevered, clich&eacute;d, sophomoric and bearing only a tenuous connection to reality.<br /><br />And is the book really that special?  Besides the depth of research Trevanian obviously had to undergo to write the book, what's really so great about it?  It starts off well, but the middle is a muddle, with little action and only Heinlein-esque political sermons given against the backdrop of straw man arguments.  The ending is disappointing, anti-climactic and illogical (if the Corporation That Runs the World really runs the world, why couldn't they suppress an unflattering report on an assassination?).<br /><br />But, what the Hel, I can't say the book's all bad. Where else could we get an apology for the Japanese occupational forces, the rape of Nanking, and the Greater Asian Co-Prosperity sphere? Only Trevanian could have the sheer chutzpah to try.  Give the man his props at least for that.	2004-09-29
US	30095884	R1QSJBWOPKUK8Z	1593301111	28171385	Suddenly Strangers	Books	4	27	30	N	N	The unmistakable ring of truth	So much of anti-Mormon literature is boring, rote, intellectually dishonest and laughably lightweight.  This book is none of those things.  It doesn't fall into the normal anti-Mormon trap of hysterics (usually expressed through interesting typography like bolding, underlining, italics, exclamation points and all caps -- and sometimes all at once), hyperbole and sloppy reasoning.  The book instead sets up the classic paradigm of pitting a priori knowledge against a posteriori knowledge.  Happily for Chris and Brad, Locke wins over Descartes.<br /><br />But this is more than just two peoples' struggle to square historical reality with their religious instruction.  It's also a tale of morality, a tale of what one's ultimate values are.  It really is, in its small way, a tale of courage.  Paul Tillich defined courage as the doing of something \\"in spite of.\\"  At any time, either Brad or Chris could have given up their search for truth with few ill effects.  Instead they chose to do the right thing in their minds and both suffered much, and risked much more, as a result.<br /><br />Additionally, the book is actually quite humorous in parts.  I particularly enjoyed the varied and sometime hilarious reactions of siblings and relatives.  Everything from \\"Don't come near my children!\\" from a sister to serene acceptance from a brother.  And Brad's and Chris' parents deserve gold stars for not freaking out like so many of their children did.<br /><br />However, the book does have some drawbacks.  Throughout the book but particularly in the later chapters, the brothers take aim needlessly at various Mormon doctrines.  Obviously, some discussion of the questionable events and practices surrounding Mormonism are necessary to understanding why the brothers apostasized in the first place, but toward the end of the book it seems that they employ a shotgun approach, commenting not only on the big issues such as BofM unsubstantiated archeology, polygamy and Blacks and the priesthood, but also on more obscure and less relevant controversies such as Brigham Young's reputed anti-Semitism, the post hoc inclusion of prophesies, Mountain Meadows, Adam-God and blood atonement.  It seems that Brad and Chris are merely showing off their knowledge of these issues, as opposed to demonstrating how these issues actually played a decisive role in their apostasy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an outstanding book and the first anti-Mormon book I've read that has honest emotions and reasoning woven throughout.  I found myself nodding in agreement at parallels to my own religious experience, most importantly the experience of fear of confronting received religious faith and the satori of understanding that the defect had been within me all along.  I have felt what Brad felt: \\"I was alarmed by the discovery of my own moral arrogance, by how condescending and intolerant I had been...I [realized I] am the master of my own deceit.\\"and less relevant controversies such as Brigham Young's reputed anti-Semitism, the post hoc inclusion of prophesies, Mountain Meadows, Adam-God and blood atonement.

This book was perfect.  Here are its advantages:<br />(1) There was none of the faux-pretentious King James-style English.  Not that the KJV is bad, it was fine for 1611, but why have 17th century-sounding English in the 21st centurty if you don't need to?<br />(2) very good intro that explains the origin of the Apocrypha and the history of its various books.  In a short space the author tells everything an interested amateur like me needs to know.<br />(3) very reasonable price for the book, which was appreciated.<br />As for the Apocrypha itself, it renewed my interest in bible study.  I found the Maccabees to be invaluable to my understanding of the progressive combination of political-religious leadership, which provided a good bridge to understanding the political order found in the New Testament.  The stories of Daniel were interesting in and of themselves.  And there were nuggets of wisdom such as &quot;where man ends, God begins&quot; that were exceptionally thought-provoking, at least to me.  Highly, highly recommended.	2004-02-02
