Unfortunately this text is not nearly as popular as Lippmann's precursor work \\"Public Opinion\\".  It's a classic of the elite nihilistic attitude towards the masses, astoundingly pessimistic, Lippmann puts into language suited for the very common person a total denunciation of that person's abilities.  His logic is not very strong though on many occasions, such as when he goes on about how we are expected to make decisions about such and such one day and such other trivial matter the next... he oversimplifies to draw his sought after conclusions. <br /> <br />One should read this though to get a good grasp of how the elite members of government and media learned to treat the public.	2005-06-28

It's a shame that his books have become so popular because he's not very good.   <br />Pojman's biases seem obvious and annoying as he openly dismisses certain areas of thought without giving much attention or development to what he's supposed to be covering (such as his treatment of existential phenomenology) which is really bad for an intro textbook.   <br />But anyhow, this just isn't very good.

Still, this is a worthy testament to the greatness that is Pittsburgh's Mattress Factory, one of the most innovative and exciting locations to experience contemporary art in the world.  There are very few exhibition spaces in the world devoted exclusively to installation art and the Mattress Factory may very well be the best.  Even in Paris, the installation spaces of the Pompidou and the Palais de Tokyo, while wonderful, don't match the experience of the Mattress Factory.   <br />If you are ever in Pittsburgh, the Mattress Factory should be at the top of your list to check out.  This book acts as a nice teaser and sampling of the types of installations that have been present, but as to what to expect in the future?  Who knows?!	2004-12-13

What this work offers is some very thorough and thoughtful criticism of the current systems of internationalism and globalization, a sharp critique of the dominant counter logics of Marxism, Anarchism and other central positions of the Global Justice Movement(while giving them credit where due, as he does throughout) and it moves beyond to offer solid proposals for a world parliament, a refined UN and an updated version of Keynes' \\"Clearing House\\" concept which was spurned in the Bretton Woods 'debates'.  In combination, these three bodies are supposed to replace the international governing bodies currently in place, instill greater democracy and promote sustainable living.  It does sound very idealistic, right?  Read the book.  Monbiot is extremely well researched and is entirely forthcoming in admitting the hugeness of the tasks at hand, but is equally compelling in demonstrating that such a huge plan needs to be undertaken, and soon.  Monbiot's work is realistic, without faltering into the trap of 'realism' and it's self-fulfilling pessimism. <br />Consider this work to be one of the major first steps, a serious and worthy proposal for further debate.	2004-08-16

Although some of the situations that were current during the writing of this book have changed quite a bit, the general analysis and much of the information and quotes provided are highly relevant.  Ramonet brings some intriguing ideas to debates on globalization and the role of the state and his work on the problems of groups reverting to occult and nationalist dogmas, the politics of fear in the face of a so-called modernity that works against their interests... Ramonet keenly psychologizes the patters of oppressed peoples seeking strength in taking out aggressions on other oppressed peoples, since the centers of power are so far away, and the powerful able to manipulate opinion and information in many areas to achieve such a result.  Ramonet confronts the question, throughout this work, what is the role of the state in these times and how can a concerned populus move beyond the false security of antiquated ideologies to actually take back some sovereignty?  It's a brave work... though there are some downfalls... <br />For one, the translation was obviously quick as there are numerous annoying mistakes and gaps... and there is little in the way of actual citation.  And while I recognize some of the material cited, it is very annoying and opens the book up to calls of credibility that such important citations are missing. <br />Ramonet's newer work in translation is much better and suffers from none of these flaws.	2004-08-09

In one relatively short work, he is able to bring together a vast and sweeping set of information and analysis on current environmental, political, economic and cultural trends in order to piece together their interlockings and formulate a cohesive picture of the state of the world.  His information and reasoning are solid, while his analysis is definitively negative and could certainly be accused of pessimism, you will see that Ramonet has every right to be concerned.  And we should not shy away from reading this book for its sweeping scope and presentation of highly devastating global trends.  If we should not get caught between an indifferent global neo-liberalism that places profit above people and a regressive nationalism that could revive fascist racisms, we must face up.  If we should not like to wait and see what ecological crises may be in store for us, we must open our ears to these arguments.  If we should prefer to pretend to be happy and content, we can keep our eyes on our tvs and continue to shop mindlessly and not read such works, hoping that others will take care of the world for us and not lead us to disaster.  But democracy requires daily work and an ability to take seriously the threatening trends that have emerged.   <br />This book is highly recommended, and is unique for its inclusion of ecological matters, as central to its political and economic critique.	2004-08-09

At this time, the debates ranging over topics like the current wars, the presidential election and even the content and effect of Michael Moore's recent film have spurred some pointless tangents deflecting needed effort and attention from much more important debates.  Lucas' book is a solid criticism of the damage wrought by such self-aggrandizing attacks as the ones Hitchens, Walzer and others have popularized.  Of course, others on the left from Mickey Z to Eric Alterman have been guilty of similar diatribes, and numerous others have been caught up in such games defensively.  <BR>Beyond this, the work on Orwell is very interesting and saddening to a degree.  Even the fan of Orwell should take the book seriously, for it does not discredit many of the core tenets readers have taken away from Orwell's work, which often remain solid, but in fact furthers the work which many hold Orwell in high esteem for, but which he himself seems to have shied away from.	2004-07-10

Aside from Frank Kozik (who, while interesting, is not very inspiring) the people included in this anthology are vital, engaged artists, writers and just regular people who share some remarkable stories, fascinating insights.

What it is not is an introduction into those topics, but neither is it written in a style that is overly academic.  McGilvray seeks to integrate Chomsky's linguistic and political work somewhat and with a small amount of success, suggesting that they are intertwined and of course they are to a vague degree.  That angle is interesting in its own way, but luckily the author does not force his hypothesis too much, instead he does a rather good job of overviewing and summarizing the main emphases of Chomsky's work in a cohesive and enlightening fashion.  Probably not a necessary read for those who have read a lot of Chomsky's own works in both fields, but for those who haven't, or for people who simply enjoy reading in politics, philosophy and/or linguistics this book should make for interesting study.	2003-04-05

However, I should respond to another reviewer's claim that Professor Tabb is not well researched in that he does not cite much from academic journals.  this is true, as the scope and focus of this book lies outside of academic ideological posturing on world issues and goes to the statistical facts, actual statements and track records of global finance institutions and examines the official public line on these issues, as documented in the Economist and the Wall Street Journal.  this book is in fact very well researched, and very much worth your time.	2003-03-04

Fences and Windows is a poignant and highly important collection of on-the-scene essays and articles from Klein's travels participating in and observing the ongoing struggles between ruling elites and a diverse array of opposition.  Klein is an excellent writer and very incisive.  She brings the brute reality of the fences being drawn around democracy while the corporate globalization movement claims to be opening windows to freedom.  But it is the diverse and decentralized &quot;global justice&quot; movement that is working to open the windows to a truly democratic globalization, one that places people over profits.  While the WTO and FTAA factions work to push through economic legislations that will further remove most people from democratic decision making, the police are developing more brutal strategies to scare the conscientious populace from participation in demonstrations.  But as this political climate heats up, the decentralized movement is coming together more cohesively in the face of this repression.  Klein writes of how politics is becoming a &quot;gated community,&quot; and how the protest movements are struggling but still pushing for real democracy.  There are no easy answers in Fences and Windows, but lots of necessary information and insight for anyone who cares about their world.	2003-02-02

The articles that comprise Prison Nation not only offer perspectives on prison life and the legal system, but make for a very in depth primer in American politics.  A continuing thread through many of the works is an emotional and fact based analysis of how the U.S. legal system works against the poor and working classes, while generally ignoring or even rewarding the crimes of the upper classes and corporations, while corporate crime does far more economic and even physical damage (as in deaths due to workplace hazards and malpractice, for instance).  George Winslow's article \\"Capital Crimes\\" lays out in plain terms the damage done by corporate crime, while giving the facts on how little our system does to stop it.  Noam Chomsky's \\"Drug Policy as Social Control\\" is a very brief, but extremely inciteful look at the politics behind the \\"war on drugs\\".  There are 3 essays contributed by Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is simply one of the most eloquent and powerful political writers of our day, free man or not.  Other essays deal with the cultural effects and ethical implications of the \\"private prison\\" industry and the prison labor trade, and many other potent topics.  Of course, many of us already know that around 85% of prisoners are locked up for non-violent offenses.  Many of us are aware of police brutality in our own neighborhoods, of race and class profiling... but what do these things mean in the bigger picture of American ideology and U.S. culture.  Prison Nation offers many valuable facts, insights and questions about these topics which are central to our society.  Routledge has once again published another invaluable book that many publishers would not take a chance on.  Their reputation in publishing is solid in many subjects and this book certainly lives up to their reputation.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-21

The battle to free the press is still being waged on the fringes, but progress is being made.  More and more people are losing faith in their corporate news sources, and there is good reason.  People know that there is more than they are being told.  That things are not merely black and white, good vs. evil.  And more and more people are starting to view media reform as a viable subject for political debate.  But you won't hear about it in the mainstream media.  Luckily, people like Project Censored and Seven Stories Press are doing an excellent job of both getting the news out there and offering critique of the corporate news conglomerates.  Censored 2003 offers an excellent introduction by Robert McChesney on the current state of the media in the U.S., the top 25 \\"Censored\\" stories and runners up from the late 2001 and 2002 (Censored in that they did not receive nearly the coverage the issues warrant in importance.)  Also included is Mark Crispin Miller's diagram of the \\"Big Ten\\", the ten leading media conglomerates listing all of their media holdings and earnings... looking this over, you start to feel how enormous and just plain not right their power is.  Also included is an essay on the New York School Systems censored standardized literature and reading comprehension tests, a detailed account of how the U.S. military works for big oil (the stuff of conspiracy theories one may think, but reading the hard facts and evidence will make you think again) and some excellent cartoons from the famed Tom Tomorrow.

In a true Arendtian sense, Kimberly Curtis rescues the pearls of Hannah Arendt's political philosophy for the contemporary predicament.  The totalitarian model is still lurking around the corner, and while we allow ourselves to become more beauraucratized, more sheltered in the enclaves of our gated communities, blocking out the plight of the workers who labor to make our commodities, becoming ever more apolitical, we are allowing ourselves to slip ever closer to totalitarianism once again.  And the insights of Hannah Arendt are perhaps more vital now than ever before.  Here, Curtis simply does an excellent job of revitalizing the spirit of Arendt's work... definitely one of the best sources on Arendtian politics I have read.	2003-01-21

In No Logo, Naomi Klein investigates and extrapolates on the growing political trend of \\"brand-based activism\\".  Through her own experience, travels, interviews and research she puts together an amazingly engaging and poignant book.  Within these pages, Klein illuminates the ambiguities of modern dissent, the interconnectedness of predicaments the world over.  From the \\"reclaim the streets\\" parties in Europe which demonstrate for the need for open public space, the struggles of garment workers in the Phillipines and elsewhere, unable to earn enough to live, unable to organize, unable to achieve a decent standard of human dignity, merely used because they have nowhere else to go, used as cheap labor... to the shock tactics of Greenpeace and the infamous McLibel trial, and so on.  We begin to see the web connected, how many small movements are fighting common enemies, fighting for common goals.  How none of it is easy, or even easily definable, except citizens continue to find themselves protesting the largest symbols of corporate greed and unaccountablity.  <BR>At the same time as major corporations strip themselves of workers and contract out production to sweatshops, they bolster their public image, attempting to transcend the idea of being manufacturers, to being about \\"sport\\" about \\"life\\".  They seek to be visible everywhere and incorporate everything into their identity.  Images like the Nike logo, or the \\"golden arches\\" become more than the products of the companies, and in more ways than the companies intend.  They become symbols of power.  They symbolize many of the grievances many have over the suffering and poverty and power of the \\"free trade\\" ideology.  Of the WTO, IMF and the whole host of anonymous international organizations making the political decisions that effect us all.  But it is these ever-present logos which are most readily attacked, precisely because it is they which wish to come into our homes, to be worn on our chests, to have us feel a part of them.  It is these super-brand identities that have the most to lose in public relations.  It also makes it easier for people to get involved in world politics, when they make clear connections with the clothes on their own backs, it comes home to people.  But No Logo, is also about much more.  And Klein is rather neutral in her treatment of the many groups of dissent and \\"adbusting\\" which she covers.  She recognizes that there are not easy answers and doesn't offer any manifesto.  What Klein does is clearly illustrate the current political predicament, in all of its ambiguities and inconsistencies.  Is it a mass movement burgeoning?  Or a vast fragmented set of movements?  Are we witnessing a movement against manifestos and blanket answers all together?  Or is it merely another passing fad?  Can the current tide of dissent manage to break free of its ties to being \\"against\\" to being \\"for\\" concrete goals, or is something less tangible sought?  Read No Logo and think about these questions and many others.  Klein's book is a valuable resource for anyone who cares about real democracy and real equality and the possibility of a better future.  But it is not for the reader seeking simple affirmation of their own desires and beliefs.	2003-01-13

Media Control is perhaps the best short introduction to Chomsky's thought on politics and propaganda around.  Whereas books like 9-11 and \\"What Uncle Sam Really Wants\\" are choppy and prone to misunderstood interpretations by readers not already accustomed to Chomsky, Media Control is coherent, in depth and very easy and quick to read.  The essay is from the time after the U.S. invasion of Iraq known as \\"Desert Storm\\" and traces the uses of propaganda and misinformation from that era back to the Wilson era and Walter Lippmann's theory of media control.  Chomsky perhaps displays his dry wit in this short volume more than anywhere else, with his comparisson of the typical slogan \\"support our troops\\" to the absurd slogan \\"support the people in Iowa.\\"  What this makes clear, is the emptiness of the slogan.  The question \\"do you support our troops?\\" cannot be answered with a \\"no\\" unless one is completely depraved.  That question however masks the underlying question \\"do you support our policy?\\" which is something that elites in the govt. and media would prefer you not think about, because the answers would be more ambiguous and require real democratic discussion.  The rulers and media heads would prefer to make those decisions for you, through what Lippmann dubbed \\"consent without consent\\".  The mass media (now controlled largely by six major firms who all have holdings and enter into joint ventures with one another.) constrain debate on issues to within a moderate range, so of course most of the media will look to be at the \\"liberal\\" end of the allowed spectrum, but that only has the effect of cutting anything further to the \\"left\\" out of the discussion, so arguments many tend to go between something like the \\"hawks\\" who are for immediate war, unilaterally, and the \\"doves\\" largely represented in the media, who may tend to stand for \\"multi-lateralism\\" or waiting for more info.  Thus, many who have other ideas on the subject are left out of mainstream debate, and thus seemto not exist.  What we are left with is a host of false-dichotomies and debates that we don't even want to be in.  <BR>... Also, this new edition of Media Control is expanded to include transcript of a talk, previously printed in FAIR, which is a little thought experiment about how a journalist from Mars (which is what journalists who work with a critical edge are often treated like), who is highly trained at the best journalism schools in the U.S., would cover the \\"war on terrorism.\\"  It is interesting to read the current essay in light of the essay on the Iraq conflict ten years past.  (and the new cover and print is much more attractive than the 1st edition).	2003-01-13

Those who denounce him in these reviews as a radical liberal, don't know much about Hitchens' politics, especially in recent history.  Having turned very pro-war with Iraq, Hitchens has begun denouncing leftists everywhere you look, mostly with ad hominem remarks.  It's all very puzzling and a bit disconcerting.  But the relevant point is that Hitchens is not some bitter pacifist.  But in this book he shows that he has some sense of history and legality about him as he pieces together one massive case condemning Henry Kissinger for crimes against humanity.  The facts are all there.  Hitchens doesn't hold back with his verbal assault on Kissinger, but he also doesn't hold back evidence.  <BR>The case of Kissinger is still entirely relevant to our political culture and to humanity at large (I.E.: this book is not pointless conjecture like trying to find Jack the Ripper.)  Kissinger still wields great influence in policy making and is seen as an elder statesman, a role model.  He is everything Macchiavelli ever wanted to be and more.  His legacy deserves to be discredited.  <BR>This may be Hitchens' most important book.	2002-12-17

Howard Zinn is an eloquent but plain spoken writer.  His essays are a joy to read, something that cannot be said of so many historians.  This is in part because, Zinn is not afraid to admit that he is an interpreter of events, he colors his writings with his own ideals, interprets the past in light of what he has lived through, illuminating events and the lives of people who may have otherwise been forgotten, so that we can learn something of ourselves in their stories.  Zinn's writings on events of the twentieth century are special in that he has participated in so many important historical movements, from being a WWII bombardier, to teaching in an all black girls' college during the civil rights movement, through protesting the Vietnam War and beyond.  He is not afraid to state his beliefs, but is never condescending.  He is a believer in the spirit of humanity, in spite of all the atrocities he has seen and studied.  This massive collection spans many years and many topics.  There is not an uninteresting essay in the nearly 700 pages, though, making this quite a bargain at that.  Don't pass this book up.  Even if you don't consider yourself of the \\"leftist\\" persuasion, I think you will find Zinn's writings very engaging and enjoyable.  I hope you do.	2002-12-13

This collection of writings, spanning much of his public career is a testament to his dedication.  As Barbara Eherenreich states in the preface, \\"he's gotten more radical over the years, not less.\\"  His concern for fairness and freedom has taken him into many areas of confrontation with the corporate and ruling elite.  He obviously had the most distinguished public record of all candidates in the last presidential election.  But even if we the people don't give him the respect he deserves with our votes, he will continue to work for us, because his work is not to gain power, but to give us back our power.  This collection of essays is of vital importance.  Use it to enlighten yourself and perhaps you will find yourself as driven as Citizen Nader to help restore democracy.  (Also, Steve Andersen's review for Amazon is very well put.)  If you haven't read or listened to Ralph Nader, you are only hurting yourself.	2002-12-13

Gelven makes very clear and accessible, but without watering down, all of the major concepts, terms and ideas brought out in Being and Time, a book which can be extremely intimidating and confusing, especially in translation.  This is perhaps the best work on explaining the project of Heidegger's philosophy.  If you just want to read one book by Heidegger or wish to gain an understaning of Heidegger's philosophy, don't read a book by Heidegger, read this book instead.  Gelven's text is a great starting point and handy reference.  I'd highly recommend bringing this book to any class in which one is trying to teach or learn Heidegger.	2002-05-06

The novel deals largely with individuals' varying reactions to the plague as it emerges and settles in on the city of Oran.  Only those who act or are important in the development of the scene are named, and though many of the characters perceive reality differently, we are able to sympathize with where they are coming from.  The novel is about overcoming indifference and performing good acts that we are all capable of.  Camus makes it clear that there are no heroes in the novel, only people who recognize their responsibility and embrace life.  Even though the plague is ultimately \\"defeated,\\" there is no typical happy ending, for the plague bacillus never dies.  This novel is still entirely relevant to our world today.  The central point of Camus' writing is \\"the absurd.\\"  The absurd is characterized by the confrontation of \\"rational man and the indifferent universe.\\"  Camus dismisses ideas such as transcendence, or a leap of faith, there is no existential commitment.  He looks to embrace the absurd, to keep it alive.  Camus is very much a moralist and a pacifist; he deplored one-sided views of any political situation, and broke off relationships with other prominent writers of his time such as Sartre, whose ties to Communism and justification of violence Camus abhorred.  He did not wish to take sides in the French-Algerian war.  Camus did not seem to identify with a particular people, a belief system or any form of certainty, but viewed man as being in constant revolt against the powers that tried to enslave him, keeping him from living.  Camus would rather embrace the absurdity of life than a frail system.  Camus did not accept, as other \\"existentialist\\" writers of his time did, that humans were born into the world as nothing and it was up to the individual to entirely assert his own identity through his/her acts.  \\"For Camus a man's acts could reveal an intrinsic integrity or dignity which were always there but which had laid dormant and unasserted until he was made to face the absurdity of his mortal condition in an immortal universe.\\"(Masters, Camus: A Study).  How The Plague deals with Reality:<br />- Subjectivity, shows how one person's reality is not the same as another's.  It is only when people begin to realize that they are indeed \\"in the same boat\\" as one another (that they have common interests and a common spirit to fight for, and that they needn't be alienated from one another) that the plague can be seen as a real problem which needs to be fought, rather than an abstraction which must be hidden from.<br />- Shows how many cannot comprehend the enormity of a situation until it falls upon them, still often triggering disbelief.<br />- Looking at the \\"small things,\\" people's reactions, etc. which \\"history\\" might ignore.<br />- Paying close attention to the conditions of the society; the indifference and apathy that helped to allow the plague to take hold.<br />- In historicizing an event like the Nazis occupation and plundering of Europe, it seems all too easy to look past the indifference which allowed such events to take place.  The view in much of Europe was that it was someone else's problem, and even after their own nation was attacked, many merely tried to adapt, acted to appease the Nazis, or hoped that it would soon pass... they still saw it as someone else's problem to take care of.  Camus was born in poverty in Algeria, somewhat of a \\"stranger\\" in France during the German occupation, but he found himself confronted with the situation, nonetheless, and was a key contributor to the French resistance army.  One of his most important contributions was his work as the editor of Combat, the major underground resistance newspaper informing others of the problems and giving voice to a movement that all individuals needed to recognize their place in.<br />I hope that in reading Camus' Plague, you will be inspired and recognize the great relevance this novel still holds.l still holds.	2002-04-28

I've been familiar with Biafra/Rollins/Childish and Ferlinghetti for a long time, but can't say I'm a huge fan of any of the four, but in reading through these interviews, I have a whole new respect for all of them.  Vale talks about so many issues of political importance, artistic integrity, life, and everything with them.  What comes through is not esoteric or academic, not something only appealing to punks or poets, but a feeling of being alive.  All four are very smart, funny, engaging and interesting individuals and Vale really knows how to bring out their personalities.  This is like a bible of common sense from 4 great prophets of the eternal underground.  If you yearn to be creative and find your own happiness outside of the constraints of a 9-5 job and mainstream culture, this book will hopefully be an inspiration to you.  It's also refreshing to hear people talking about important political and philosophical issues in a way that makes you believe that you can be involved and help make culture and live how you want.  We also glimpse into their lives outside of the public eye through some wonderful storytelling.  Vale helps to put the nail in the coffin of the &quot;dumb punk&quot; notion: these guys are geniuses.  You need this book!	2002-04-28

It is a very interesting inside look at one of the most vividly remembered tours in independent rock history.  A lineup featuring the likes of these many performers will probably never cross the U.S. again in my lifetime.  The Kathleen Hanna incident doesn't actually dominate Thurston's entries, but takes up a large chunk of his journals.  Beck's entries are great.  David Yow doesn't say too much...  One overriding theme is how big of a jerk Courtney Love really is.  There are plenty of little interesting stories relayed along the way.  Don't miss out you Sonic Youth and Beck fans!

In a college Shakespeare class, which I came into with a strong anti-Shakespeare bias, I found myself confused with the language, bored and indifferent with the stories and frustrated.  So, I went out and picked up this book (I had read Frye's the Archetypes of Literature) and it immediately changed my outlook on the old bard.  I soon noticed that much of what my professor was lecturing in class was taken from Frye's work.  I had discovered the secret.  This is a very readable, interesting and witty look into many of the Shakespearean plays.  Frye is quite unusual for a literary critic, he's fun to read.	2002-04-21

Her critique of the global economy and social structure here at home are right on track.  She gives a framework for some proposals for how to change our system.  I do not find all of her every one of her proposals to be desirable, but do appreciate the spirit and breadth of her arguments.

(First of all, there is a paperback printing of this, as I have it.)<BR>This is a very readable, very well organized overview and assessment of Hannah Arendt's political philosophy.  The book is broken into 5 major sections: 1) Introduction 2)Arendt's conception of modernity 3)Arendt's theory of Action 4) Arendt's theory of judgement &amp; 5) Arendt's conception of citizenship.  <BR>Now, anyone familiar with Arendt's work is probably already well aquainted with these themes, yet this book manages to bring more life to these major concepts and takes some of the most illuminating quotes from Arendt's works, so that the reader needn't take the author's word on what Arendt meant.  <BR>This book is not merely an introduction to Arendt (though it is fine as that, too) it is a sharp critique of her ideas, but is aware that even when her words seem inadequate, the spirit of Arendt's political philosophy is still strong; and d'Entreves does quite well emphasizing this intangible aspect of Arendt's philosophy.  He addresses the criticisms and responses of many philosophers and critics and draws Arendt into a dialogue with these writers, helping to continue the project of Arendtian philosophy.	2002-04-20

The entire mood and circumstances of this novel are quite different.  Certainly The Subterraneans is an interesting and necessary read for Kerouac fans, but certainly not a book i would recommend to readers just getting into Kerouac.  The book is perhaps a bit too realistic, too depressing and self depreciating, without the hopeful philosophic spirit of his most popular works.  It contains a lot of passages that just make you cringe, and some awkward archaic language when talking about Mardou.  But there is still a bit of transcendental magic hidden in this book.  Kerouac's strength really lies in his ability to open up those small moments of every day, the existential dread and desire is always there, we are always trying to make ourselves in every moment.  Here we find it all taking its toll hard on him.<BR> It is definitely a quick read, however, and of course Kerouac's less than great books are still better than so many other books out there.  I'd recommend taking it out of a library or getting it used, though.  <BR>It is a snapshot of three days in the life of Leo Percepied (Kerouac) and perhaps its greatest value lies in its demystification of beat culture.  Kerouac isn't finding buddha here, he's finding his inadequacies. \\"this is the story of an unself-confident man\\"(page 1).	2002-04-20

The ten chapters of this book compile question and response material taken from talks Chomsky delivered throughout the 1990s.  The chapters are conveniently marked where the topic shifts, so that if you want to look up Chomsky's views on a particular issue, you easily can.  Everything in this book is still extremely relavent.  Even if you think you've heard it all before and have read a lot of other Chomsky books, it is still inspiring to read Chomsky and this book is perfect to have around as a refresher.  It is also the perfect introduction for those who are beginning to have an interest in progressive politics.  All of the classic wit, wisdom, logic, (incredible memory skills) and integrity of Noam Chomsky come shining through in this collection.  (For those who have only heard the name of Chomsky slandered and ridiculed, I encourage you to read through some of this book and ask yourself, why is it that nobody ever really addresses Chomsky's arguments, but will profusely attack him with ad hominem denunciations?)  Of all the Chomsky books I have read, this one is the most definitive.	2002-04-20

David Cooper does a fantastic job of selecting key excerpts from the great works in Metaphysics covering the dawn of Greek philosophy up through Heidegger.  He also includes some key Eastern texts, something missing from many anthologies.  Cooper organizes the works in a logical, historical progression and situates them nicely with brief introductions to each selection.  This is a very good textbook for any Metaphysics course and also a good purchase for any student of lover of philosophy who simply doesn't have the time or moneyto read through the entire texts of Kant, Heidegger, Schopenhauer, Spinoza, etc.  Also, in reading through massive, difficult texts such as The Critique of Pure Reason or Being and Time it can be hard to know exactly what you are looking for.  What Cooper does is cut to some of the most relevant sections of these works.  I feel that dealing with the primary texts is necessary and rewarding for those teaching or taking Metaphysics.  For all of those people, I would highly recommend this book.	2002-04-20

Bush's pre-presidential life	There has been a lot of debate already on this book, so I won't go into much detail.  It is the most broad scoped, in-depth anti-Bush book out there.  Why is it that so many of the allegations made in this book have escaped public scrutiny?  Why did so many Texas republicans work so hard at trying to keep this book out of print?  How could we not take a harder look at who we elect as President?  Now, to the pro-Bush crowd out there, I will concede that perhaps some of the allegations are stretched and maybe some are not true, but how can we not take them seriously?  This book does not offer a pro-democrat/anti-republican storyline, but what lies underneath the attack on Bush is an attack on the manner in which America allows its leaders to be pre-selected for us by Party heads and Corporate big wigs who simply don't care about ethics or about our great nation.  As a democracy we should have a media which takes the time to investigate and debate upon these concerns, not one that limits debate and simply repeats prepared statements.  We deserve better.  Now if you do pick up this book, do be sceptical.  J.H. Hatfield is certainly not the most principled man and he does have a biased stance.  But many of the issues at hand do transcend the author's inadequacies.  This book will frustrate and infuriate you, no matter what your politics.	2002-04-20

Robert McChesney makes media study and criticism fun.  He offers a huge background of historical knowledge, factual information and common sense logic to back up his claims for media reform.  This is a large book, but not a boring read.  The media landscape is (d)evolving at a rapid pace and the book may already be in need of updating, but the general ideas and arguments remain current.  For the reader with less time on their hands, pick up either \\"Corporate Media and the Threat to Democracy\\" or \\"It's the Media, Stupid\\"(w/John Nichols) which don't contain the breadth of historical and factual support of this book, but are very good introductions to the issues presented here and can be read in only a couple of hours.<br />And yes, Professor McChesney is not ashamed to say he is a liberal-progressive, but I think that his work would be of interest to persons of any political stance who don't have strict ties to the major media corporations.  Conservatives, liberals, progressives and moderates all have a stake in these concerns.  The media is our modern town square, our public sphere.  If the public is blocked even moreso from society's primary means of discourse, what chance does democracy stand?	2002-04-14

It is a pleasure to read if you have or have not seen the film based on it (the book is even better than the film).  Joanne Harris is a wonderful author, capable of conveying excellent character development, imagery and sensual experience.  Chocolat will be one of the most pleasant reading experiences you've ever had.  It is on one level, entertaining, on another it is philosophically and politically engaging in a way that is not preachy nor confrontational; but rather brings the reader into contemplating the issues of seeking meaning and confronting prejudice in a very uplifting manner.  There are a number of different elements to the novel than will be found in the film, of course, and it is interesting to see the differences, though the general feel is the same.  Harris is such a skillful writer, and I encourage you to read all of her novels if you have a chance.  I apologize if my reviewing skills are not as good.	2002-04-08

Before reading this novel I would recommend going back and absorbing both Generation X and Life After God, which are better introductions to Coupland's style.  Coupland takes you on a trip to find the meaning of love, life and spirituality in a post-modern world riddled with banal strip-mall landscapes, drug addictions, the accelerated pace of pop-culture, generation gaps, and technological dominance.  He gives us human beings still trying to make their way through the world, wondering what lies beyond, fearing apocalypse, seeking love and a self.  All in all his works are very amusing, engaging, poignant and thoughtful.  He is a master of observation of both the small and grand.  I've never read anyone quite like him.  (and yes, there are a few Smiths references in the book.)	2002-04-08

Essays such as &quot;Globalization, the Politics of Identity and Social Hope&quot; and &quot;Looking backwards from the year 2096&quot; are interesting reads and are well written.  Rorty offers some valid criticisms of academia and some interesting viewpoints on important issues.  I don't generally find myself disagreeing with too many of his ideals as I do with his approach to them.  His relativistism meets pragmatism style makes me feel like I'm reading the Economist.  Now the Economist writes some pretty good articles that seem to be observing &quot;both sides&quot; (as if there were only 2 sides in any given issue.) but in the end simply settling on some slightly redressed version of the status quo.  Both Rorty and the Economist give me the same feeling, they will say that there is so much to be done in the world and wouldn't it be nice if we could do something, but there is no lively spirit to their writings, just posturing from some lofty height.  If you like reading Pat Buchanan's yearnings for the mythical old days, you might find some interest in this book.  Otherwise, stay away.

This book reminds me of why I first got interested in reading Sartre.  It brings out the exciting spirit of Existentialist philosophy by focusing on the most poignant passages of Sartre's works.  I do feel the book to be a bit pricey for a paperback, but all in all it is a rather aesthetically pleasing book.  The binding and layout are high quality, as is usual for Routledge texts.  Also, this book offers the complete &quot;Existentialism and Humanism&quot; lecture, including transcript of a question and answer forum which you will not find in most editions.  Priest also does a decent job of providing biographical information in the chapter &quot;Sartre in-the-world.&quot;	2002-04-02
