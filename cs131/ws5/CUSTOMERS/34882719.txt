I've never run across an author who is able to &quot;paint&quot; with words.  I didn't like Frederica Potter, introduced in the first novel of Byatt's four-book series, A Virgin In The Garden.  I didn't sympathize with her.  I didn't understand her cold, passionate, intellectual personality.  By the end of Still Life, I desperately cared for her.  The third book, Babel Tower, disturbs me.  That's a different review.  Still Life is superior to A Virgin In The Garden.  I couldn't put it down.  If you're a Byatt fan, don't miss these novels.  The seem to be more unwieldly than Possession, but Byatt's genius is all there.	2003-02-14

However, I was just unable to find anything humorous about a middle-aged college professor's foolish seduction attempts with a young, female student of his.  It's not funny, it's pathetic and banal.  Why is thirty-six year Jessie portrayed as an over-the-hill old maid yet the handsome curate of precisely the same age ends up with a nineteen year old, youngest daughter of Lord Somebody at the end of the story?  It's an old-fashioned plot that hasn't stood the test of time.  I thought the curate's matrimonial choice demonstrated shallow regard for money, youth and beauty.  It became too much, the clash between gossiping, nasty-minded old women versus the horny old men striving to demonstrate their virility.  Did my mother-in-law write this?  The attitudes expressed in this tedious tale had none of the sincere wit of Jane Austen and none of her sympathetic characterizations.  Was I supposed to identify with Jessie?  She was the only character with any indication of a thoughtful, sensitive introspection yet she ended in the same dreary spot, still in a position of humiliation, on a bleak day, as part of the furniture.	2003-02-11

This is the only novel of that phase I've held onto.  I was in love with pre-revolutionary Russian history at the time.  As I re-read some passages of Johnson's, I am still overcome by \\"art\\".

It's not as though I feel I'm prudish about topics dealing with issues young adults face.  I loved Laurie Halse-Anderson's, Speak.  Elske, however, disturbed me because I felt as though I were reading an illicit child-pornography tract.  Instead of a thought-provoking examination of the exploitation girls may encounter, society's response to it and the ultimate successful resolution of that girl finding her voice and becoming healthy and whole, Voigt treated us to Elske's grandmother getting gang-raped to death in her stead so that she may run away... to what?

The awful subject Anderson writes about, rape, is movingly and convincingly told through the eyes of Melinda.  The environment of high school is brought to life.  All it's most poignant themes, popularity (or the lack of it), isolation and difficulty communicating with parents and teachers with their own sets of problems are written with clarity and insight. The perception that high-school days are simple in comparision with the \\"real\\" world of grown up lives is shattered brilliantly.  The terrifying realities of teen-age isolation are made clear.  Anderson skillfully brings the conclusion of this book to a satisfying end without having it seem ridiculous.  Amazing accomplishment.	2003-01-29

The &quot;quartet&quot; is four older middle-class, working people, two women and two men around the age of sixty.

Pym writes of the tragic circumstances of being condescended to by well-meaning, irritating young social workers who only seem to alienate these pensioners.

I have to be able to talk to you all about slavery, the buying and selling of human beings in the United States of America, a peculiar institution abolished by law only a few generations ago.  Styron's book was a fictional account dealing not peripherally with these issues and specifically with one man, a United States of America slave.  If there is a problem with the scholarship, judge the book by whatever incoherent and misguided poor writing that is to be found.  I was moved with sympathy, tears, anguish, anger and ultimately love by this sublime novel.  I wonder what Nat Turner would have said about Styron's adaptation?  It is preposterous for anyone now living to decide the man's opinion for him.  Styron is an artist.  He is a brilliant writer of fiction.  Obviously an opinion of my own, I'm jublilant we may each agree or disagree with my analysis.  What am I hearing from critics that proclaim Styron's, Confessions of Nat Turner, racist?

Winton's, The Riders, is a modern gothic mystery that keeps the reader engaged throughout the book.  All kinds of readers will love this book.  Tim Winton is a quiet genius.  Look for his other works.	2002-10-06

I look forward to this writer's continued development.  In Restoration, another gem of Tremain's, the story was told through the eyes of one character.  Music &amp; Silence is told in carefully interlocked segments of each characters' inner progress in the story.  Lyrical, engaging, very readable and difficult to put down.  I was very moved.	2002-10-06

Sebold's characters do things that literally make no sense.  The surviving sister is shaving her legs for the first time and her dad comes into the bathroom while she's doing it and stays to talk with her.  Am I supposed to believe that took place?  This scene as written is just one that needs a re-write.  I could not believe the preposterous situations Sebold wrote her characters into.	2002-09-14
