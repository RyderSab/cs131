The rituals presented are stiff and full of stilted language that, I suppose, is designed to make it sound as if it were old and important. In reading these rites I felt no spark of spontaneity or real emotion. One of the most disturbing ideas contained in the book is the idea that the priestess and priest of a coven are selected for their good looks and winning personalities.  Which as a high priestess should be based on exp and fact\\"The most beautiful and most magnetic young woman shall act as the Priestess, and the most comely, dynamic young man shall act as the Priest.\\" is sexist as heck i brought this book back to store and demanded another look at (page 17) This is certainly not a book worth buying and one of problems in wicca and paganism I wonder why some wiccan go dianic <BR>ED Fitch shame on you!! be balanced and do some more reading<BR>Balance is the key <br />Blessed Be;	2003-07-18

As for earler review i am  sure things have changed with the times, but some of books are just coming out are rehashing of same things that was written before and by far not complete, when i came to craft in 1991 ,not many books was out and i have been buying some of new books coming out. I found good infomation in them and sure this book is dianic driven but  have ya look at ed fitch's \\" A book of shadows\\" nice book but just as biased as heck.  My point is, all books have a opinion and This book will give outlines that show how to design rites and Best and most powerful spells come from you. as for the book  metioned by another reviewer of  Pagan Rites of Passage!(By Pauline Campanelli). sure it's great book if it was still in print which it's is not!!! so ya out of luck on it unless ya get it used, lucky i got one I would look at some of  books of old and new and find what works for you. paganism and witchcraft has changed over the years and for better and some for the worse.  My advice Just use your own judgement and remember  all books have opinions and there is no one book on any topic because people all have diffent views and tradtions Being judgementmental has no place in paganism and limits the person in my opinion.<BR>Good luck on your path<br />Blessed Be;	2003-07-18

I would not turn to it as a resource for goddess information. However, I was inspired to check out the author's bibliography to see where she got her background information. i would have given it 3 1/2 for being creative	2003-07-16

Well, apparently at least one more time. I have to admit that this book is not as nice as author's usual work. And although Silver's writings appear to still be targeting the Teen Market.<BR>i have nothing wrong with this but one thing and reason i gave it a 3 is the fact true folks, magickal timing is very important in rites. i think for some people who are new to craft they might go &quot;huh&quot; in that chapter i thought for some newbies may get lost and the book  does give ref's in back but expect to spend more to understand i think that moon phases are important but when she talks about planets on day of week and month may confuse some reading who bought this book as their first book<BR> <BR> Still, I think some of the topics covered in this book like spells for acne, which would have been great for her teen witch book. But i do like her open mindedness on her writing but some of things in her book maybe be alittle to advanced for a person new to craft. Still overall not bad a book was fun to read but i bought this book to see her style of writing and view on craft not bad but not a end all on the craft but as for acne spell issue if it work great for you just view all book as a author opinion. Her eclectic style was nice to see.<br />Not best beginner guide but not the worst and some nice imfo overall.<br />Blessed Be:	2003-07-12

However I would recommend Cunningham's Guide for soltary practicer for very basics on witchcraft then move to this book. This is one of best books on the witchcraft by far but keep a open mind there are many other books out there. This one is one of the top ones out there. I have seen it used in many covens for study groups. I think it's a must  have for the serious student.	2003-07-12

If you enjoyed Cunningham's &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner&quot;, you'll love &quot;Living Wicca&quot;, a guide for solitaries which further brings Wicca into our everyday lives and experiences. <br />Cunningham further delves into the topics of learning (tools, secrecy, self-initiation, Mysteries, and everyday Wiccan spirituality) and practicing (prayers and chants, offerings, rites, magic, deities) Wicca and to establishing your own traditions (from ritual design, to the Book of Shadows, adopting beliefs and rules). This book, like the first, is really for beginners like myself and reflects the &quot;newer&quot; Wicca and not the Old Ways or any particular modern Wiccan path. This allows the solitary practitioner to be more eclectic while still holding onto basic Wiccan traditions, albeit not strictly<br />Still not a end all on the craft but this book with referances in back are nice for those who are new to craft <br />I found this book was good to read and give people new to craft more on wicca way of life still is one of better books, I have seen and I think for your money  this book is worth it.	2003-07-12

Why did it not get the magick 5 rating well even thou it does have alot of imformation for soltary work. However on aspects of goddesses and gods was little and could have had more infomation on them. I think it was still worth the cash. Not a end all on craft but for some a good start. but it's  one of best books out there.<BR>Blessed Be:	2003-07-12

You  can get past opinions in. It does have some good techs and ideas. Also if a author choose not to respond that is their choice. On male bashing issue,I hate to drop this, but I can name 8 books out there that are bias against women in pagan community that do the same. Bias is bad either way for either sex, and I am female surprise ,and For some  this a good place for them to start and some people also forget not everyone has a pc most do but not all, and online people can say anything just as books do.I have read twice and the book had some of stuff  that made sense to me thou more details would have been nice and helful for those who are beginng to understand.<BR>My point is book has good ideas and flaws  as with any book ever written. Overall I do say the book is worth it for references. I would have added alittle more on other shifters and as for bias  issue i just ingore it. Still a good book and first of it's kind. The key to ingore a bias in a book and read it for yourself. Decide what to use what out of the book seems right and if ya want more infomation  on a topic then look for other sources. I am wolf shifter myself and i wish more people would at least try to write more about it. She seems to have some firm knowledge on shiftering and at least someone wrote about it. I would buy this book for many reasons but big one is to understand ones self which does point people in right direction.Enjoy it and to understand one self is not a easy task and this book give a start on a long journey...	2003-07-11

Still book is useful for banners and some of crafts ,but the bias turned me off in this book ,next the book talk little about the female deites which is half of dam  system ,If I was Freya I be royaly pissed  off, still their are other books out there on odin tradtion. But this  book was the most poor example, I have ever seen  written and for the record women did play a big place in ancient cultures, duh what hell ya think a valkyrie is and how the legends came about them start. Still the cover is cute thats it. Save your money and get books by Freya Aswynn she written the book much better and books by Edred Thorsson for runes,Overall This book  is one of worst Odinism books ever written just proves some authors are just out to make quick a buck, and after Fitch wrote \\"Magical rites from Crystal Well\\" which was his best book because it was not biased and well written.<BR> I would not recommend this book to any pagan.Do your reaseach and start with the myths and go from there.	2003-07-11

Which is one of big problems in wicca. The rites are simple and does give good examples on how to do a rite if your partner is gay,les,transgender which most of wicca books are very vague and avoids gay topics in the craft.<BR>Since we are in 2003 going on 2004 alot changed since 1956 and even before This book is the beginning. I think anyone who open minded are read this book will help open their minds thus better unity with wicca as whole... enjoy the book <br />Blessed Be;<BR>Windwalker	2003-07-11

I have quite of few books in my courses but this book is cute and can help teens but not everone is a teen either if she wanted acne spell then she needed to put teen witch book.I do agree with her on some points using creativity in rites is a great idea but some of stuff seems to complex for some  (hint) Some of most powerful,effective rites come from within. like all books they are opinions take them at face value and use what works for you. <BR>Blessed Be;	2003-07-11
