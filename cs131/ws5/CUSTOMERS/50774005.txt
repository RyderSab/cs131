Written fearlessly and emphatically, Disclosure tells the story of Tom Sanders, and the sexual harassment threat at the work place he is charged with against his new boss, and former lover, Meredtih Johnson.  The book is simply written splendidly, creating a good cast of characters to tackle the superb plot that Crichton creates.  We sit back and watch the novel unfold, and around every corner there is something we don't expect, and we like the novel even more because of this.  As the novel moves along at its quick, yet steady pace, we watch all the things that Tom encounters, and are smiling at the way that Crichton uses Tom as his stepping stone, crossing this line here, encountering something incredibly different there.  The novel is simply splendid in every way, and I wished that it had actually been longer, so that we could have learned more about Tom, the plot, and everything that happens because of the encounter in the office...	2002-01-24

Having heard that it was one of his better novels, I anticipated the novel to rank high on my list of all time great King books.  Boy was I surprised.  The novel doesn't really take off at any point, and kind of drags on and on and on.  Paul Sheldon is nothing compared to the writer heriones King created in most of his novels.  For example, Jack Torrance in The Shining and Mike Noonan in Bag of Bones, are great characters, while Paul just meanders aroun (not literally of course)and doesn't interest us at all.  Therfore, when Annie begins to torture him, we could really care less.  The end of the novel is very scary, I will give King that, I did indeed have goosebumps on my flesh with the final encounter, or the second final encounter I guess you could say.  Overall though, Misery falls short, and when you're done reading it, you realize the only misery you've experienced, is your feelings about this book.  Oh well, one bad book out of thirty, not to shabby.	2002-01-12

In my review of Needful Things, I wrote that Kings writes that book in the same tradition as this one.  Although Needful Things is a much better book than 'Salem's Lot, the scary and stylish vampire novel by King is very entertaining and shows signs of brilliance we see later on in such King epics as IT and Needful Things.  Many people seem to forget about this fun, simple-minded story.  King doesn't break any new barriers writing the novel, but instead, shows us that he is beginning to find his knack for his genre of writing.  Always a good read, 'Salem's Lot is a good Stephen King book to start out with, before you get to the really good stuff.	2002-01-04

Although he succeeds to some point (Trisha McFarland is a very compelling character) the novel falls short.  We really never feel that Trisha is in any sense of danger, and that takes a little away from the suspense of the novel, and what King is trying to do.  However, he is, after all, trying to tell a story, a routine one at that, but with a little bit of a twist.  The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon isn't King's worst novel of which I have read (Misery) but it also isn't his best work and skill of writing.  Disappointing, but I think we can forgive Mr. King.	2002-01-03

In the novel, we are taken through a three day journey with an old man named Santiago as he tries to capture a fish for the first time in 83 days.  The novel shoes excellent symbolism, along with Santiago's struggles with himself, and the fish he has hooked.  The Old Man and the Sea is a quick easy read, and although some might not enjoy it, the novel present itself as a classic, and turns out to be close to that.	2001-12-31

Every once and a while, King will leave behind the horror and out there plotsa, to settle down and write a book that is so true, so real, and so right on that it is scary.  The novel is sectioned off into six parts, and each has its own special moments.  King writes the plot surely, keeping us hooked at every turn, and when the climax is delivered, we smile, and really see what an excellent writer Mr. King really is.  Those people who say King is nothing more than a writer of gore and carnage, pick up The Green Mile, and read it.  I gaurentee that your mind will be changed by the time you are done with it.  Scary, smart, and thoguht provoking, The Green Mile is one of Stephen King's most cherished works.	2001-11-24

Other than IT and Carrie, nothing comes cloase to Cujo, the horror story of the rabid dog in Castle Rock who goes on a rampage killing 4 people.  The novel really is something special, with its excellent storytelling, and likeable villian, who doesn't like a rabid dog, it just all works.  The novel doesn't hang around to long, gets to the point, and then delievers.  This is Stephen King at his best, and I would reccomend Cujo to anyone.  What a great novel.	2001-11-10

With that said, I have not given the novel 5 stars, because it does have some flaws, and with that, comes some disappointment.  None of that comes from the novel's main character though.  Holden Caulfield is one of the most intruging and lost souls ever created.  The way he searches for himself in this novel is unbelievable.  We feel sorry for him, and sympathise with him, and the weird thing is, we don't even realize that we're doing it.  He is so hypnotic that by the end of the novel, we are just like him, and actually want to be like him.  We wish we could be as courageous as he was.  It's amazing that a novel could have that much power on you, but The Catcher in the Rye actually does.	2001-11-10

The novel is better than the first book in the series, The Gunslinger, mostly because of the rich characters which King intoduces in the novel.  Eddie Dean is a fascinating character.  Funny and to the point, and by the end of the novel, demanding and hopeless at the same time.  Odetta Holmes is one of the better female characters King has created in his time.  Even Jack Mort, who is only in the novel for the final three chapters is interesting in his devilish way.  The novel consists of many periods of desert and nothing much but talking and thinking from the characters, but that's what makes the book good.  We like the characters so much, that they can talk about virtually nothing for ten pages, and we don't even care.  Roland, the last gunslinger, continues to fascinate me as he continues his quest to the Dark Tower.  I must say, that I am now intersted, and ready for the rest of the journey.	2001-11-10

Boy, should I have waited.  I'm re-writing some of my reviews of old books that I've read, and I decided to start with this: the only novel I have ever given a one star to.  Eaters of the Dead offers nothing I thought it would, the action is chessy and not convincing.  The characters in the novel are dull and confusing, as is the entire novel.  I really didn't get the battles or journeys to battle the Wendol.  And they weren't anything special on top of that.  Too bad, Eaters of the Dead could have really been something.	2001-11-10

Then you open up to the first page, and your questions are answered.  From the first paragraph, when little Georgie is chasing his paper boat down the street, in the rain, to his undeniable death.  And from there, the novel takes off. Broken up into many parts, IT is Stephen King's masterpiece.  Strong, powerful stortelling, and without a doubt, his scariest novel.  The scene in which Mike is in the library, and Pennywise leaves him the baloon literally made my skin crawl.  Equally terrifying is when Ben sees Pennywise down by the icerink in the dead of winter.  Scary stuff, man.  Pennywise himself is King's most terrifying and best villian.  The idea to make a clown a mass murderer is absolutely brilliant.  We want Pennywise in every seen, and because he's not, when he shows up, we realize just how scary he is.  IT is one of the best novel I've ever read.  Stephen King broke barriers with this novel, and when you finish reading it, you'll know why.	2001-11-10

The novel entitled by the same name, written by Kaye Gibbons shows us a unique hell on wheels character, who by the time she's turned 8 years old, had been through more things than some 70 year olds live to see.  The novel tries to be a sad portrait of Ellen's life, but instead, we are amazed and intriuged the most by the way Ellen seems to always bounce back from her troubled times.  We don't feel sorry for Ellen we admire her for her couragesness, and &quot;I'm my own person and to hell with you,&quot; attitude.  Ellen Foster oddly reminded me a little bit of the novel Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson.  Although Speak is a better novel, Ellen seems to be the same type od character as Melinda from that novel.  The only major difference is in the way the authors prsent their main characters.  Eith way, both novels have a point to make, and they make it emphatically.	2001-11-06

It is in contrast with the Russian Revolution, and you smile at the way Orwell combines the historic event into his piece of literature.  The characters are endering and dim-witted, and we like this about them.  The fact that they are confused and helpless, but determined nonetheless makes the novel go off.  The end is a little bit of a let down, but it brings into percpective what Orwell is trying to prove.  The pigs have becomes the thing which all the animals had feared all along.  Along the way of their transformation, we are entertained and amused.	2001-05-26

A rarety amongst literature, To Kill A Mockingbird develops charcters that we care for, and anger that we feel towards the way we, the American people, once were.  The book does drag a bit at some parts, mainly the beginning, but the overall concept and emotion that stays with the reader upon the conclusion of the novel, far overshadows any down point in the book.  We watch as both children and adults, grow through the pages, their knowledge, but most of all, their feelings towards Tom Robinson and his family; it transcends and develops into a love far untouched in any other novel of its kind.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a heartfelt book, which will be remembered for many years to come.	2001-04-02

The novel isn't an indept character story, but a relationship story, a bond between two men, and how far one will go for the other.  Foreshadowing is evident in the book, and at just over 100 pages, you know what is going to happen within the first 30, but that isn't the point.  Steinbeck wants us to look at life from a different side.  He wants us to see the awful situations that present themselves to people, and how those certain people handle it.  Although Of Mice and Men is a simple read, the message and inpact the story leaves with you, will go far beyond the thin paper pages it was typed on nearly seventy years ago.	2001-01-21

I decided to give it three because out of the twenty short stories in this novel, I like about eleven, so about half.  Here's a quick run down of all the stories, and how they were in my opinion.<br />(Jerusalem's Lot)-pretty good opening story that is the longest of all the stories in this book, and is quite scary.  But like I said, it is the longest, and far too long at that.<br />(Graveyard Shift)-I didn't like Graveyard Shift so much, that I refused to finish it.  Neither Hall, or the rats appealed as good story points for me to continue.<br />(Night Surf)-Night Surf is a short version of The Stand.  The story really has no plot, but isn't that bad.<br />(I Am The Doorway)-Probably the second best story in the book.  Typical plot, but interesting and fun.  Good ending.<br />(The Mangler)-Probably the stupidest story in the book.  What a waste of a tree.  Come on Stephen.<br />(The Boogeyman)-Scariest story in the book with a good main character, Lester Billings, and another good ending.<br />(Gray Matter)-Third best story which is a unique storyline; a lot of fun to read.<br />(Battleground)-An okay story with a usual ending, which wastes all the suspense King tries to build up.  You know it's coming.<br />(Trucks)-Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Christine didn't thrill me as a novel, and that had a good chachter, Dennis.  Also, it was like King said &quot;To hell with it!&quot; and wrote the ending for a laugh.<br />(Sometimes They Come Back)-Good story about revenge and payback.<br />(Strawberry Spring)-In my opinion, the best story in the book.  Strawberry Spring is unique and scary, and King writes it perfectly, not giving us the main character's name, and then delivery a good, twist ending.  Fantastic.<br />(The Ledge)-I liked The Ledge.  Nothing out of the ordinary, just how far oneman will go for love I geuss.<br />(The Lawnmower Man)-What was King thinking!  I don't understand why people like this story.  It's dumb and pointless.<br />(Quitters, Inc.)-Nice story which has the best plot of any in the book, and King writes it well.<br />(I Know What You Need)-Pretty good, but very predictable.<br />(Children Of The Corn)-Another story a lot of people like that I don't get why.  Children Of the Corn is disappointing, and the very end, the last two pages, makes no sense.<br />(The Last Rung On The Ladder)-I liked this story because you understand what Larry is trying to say, even though the storyline is a bust.<br />(The Man Who Loved Flowers)-I liked this story a lot.  It was short and sweet, and King built up the innocence of the man, so that our anticipation for the ending for high.  Very good storytelling.<br />(One For The Road)-King really must like 'Salem's Lot.  Again he uses the the town infested with vampires as a story.  I liked it because Tookey and Booth were good characters.<br />(The Woman In The Room)-Sad depressing story with a message for people with dying parents: don't make them suffer.  More good storytelling.<br />So, overall, Night Shift isn't that bad, but three or four really bad stories, make me only give it three stars.	2000-12-27

With all the major  charcters being men, Marty, Alfie, Drew, Karl, I couldn't help but like the  novel because of the women involved in it.  Koontz writes Charlotte and  Emily, Marty's daughters, and Paige, his wife, so well, we wish they were  the only people in the story.  When the conversation centers around Marty  and Paige talking and trying to rationalize about Alfie, we only feel what  Paige is saying.  She's a strong charcter, Marty is not.  And the  conversations between the two little sisters, Charlotte and Emily, were so  much fun, and so right-on that I smiled and looked forward to each  conversation they had in the book.  With all the action and plot points  going on in the Mr. Murder, I don't think Dean Koontz meant for the novel  to be what I liked it for.  Oh well.	2000-08-12

I'm somewhere in the middle of those two, not knowing what to think after reading this book.   King does a nice job of creating a different kind of world in which Roland  interacts with people, and does his best to keep the reader hooked.  King  throws in some actions sequences (see The Slow Mutants and when Roland  leaves the town of Tull) to keep the book interesting for readers.  But The  Gunslinger doesn't seem to have a purpose or reason.  Sure, we know that  the main objective of the books is for Roland to rach The Dark Tower.  But  King is writing mechanically along the way, spacing things out as if they  needed to be.  I haven't read any of the other novel in the series, and  just because The Gunslingers didn't impress me, doesn't mean I won't  continue on with the series.  But even King himself says in the Afterwod  that when he writes a Dark Tower novel, he is taken away, and is trying to  figure out where and when and even how Roland will continue on his journey,  and wherehe's come from in the first place.  Because even though he writes  in flashback scenes in The Gunslinger, we still don't know much about  Cuthbert or Jamie or even who the heck Susan is and why she means so much  to Roland.  Maybe things will be explained later on in the other books.   Maybe.	2000-07-23

Many would think that the whole concept of the book to  be boring.  But it's not.  I was never bored during one point of The Long  Walk.  King writes at a steady pace, and the novel ends up being a quick  and easy read.  We read along, waiting to see who will get it next, and how  it will happen.  Sure, you know that it's going to happen to your favorite  character, but you wish that it won't, so you keep reading along.

I just got to it now, and unfortunatly, it wasn't what I was expecting.  Yes there is the usual info, and the  suspense, but something is missing from Timeline.  It seems to follow the  same formula of all action/suspense/thriller novels in which the good guys  avoid every possible danger that would lead to their death, and the  villians trip the wrong way and meet their demise.  From Chris escaping  death of &quot;skilled&quot; knights numerous times, to Kate flying off  beams high atop a castle, it just isn't realistic.  Although I must say  that Andre Marek is one of the most interesting charcters I have met in a  Crichton novel in a long time, which is saying a lot since character  description is not his high point.  A mixed review; not good, but not bad  either.	2000-07-12

It works so well in Needful Things that I found myself reading  madly and gaping my mouth many times.  Truly a gruesome and horrifying  experience, in Needful Things, King creates great characters, Alan  Pangborn, Norris Ridgewick, Polly Chalmers, Nettie Cobb, Hugh Priest, Ace  Merrill, John LaPointe, and maybe the best villian he has ever created in  Leland Gaunt.  The way he makes Gaunt so low key and friendly, and evil at  the same time is wonderful.  He also ties in all his other novels which  have taken place in Castle Rock such as Cujo, The Dead Zone, and the  novella The Body, very well.  Sure, you'll be flipping back to see what  character did what to whom when the novel takes its turning points, but  that's the fun of it.  How King can write so many things in 700 pages and  keep the reader hooked and interested.  And of course, the ending in which  evil does not fully lose.  God I love that!  Needful Things, one of Stephen  King's most entertaining books.  A must read!	2000-02-28

With Mike Noonan, King  develops a strong main character, a must for a novel of this type, told in  first person.  He develops strong supporting characters Mattie Devore, John  Storrow, and does a superb job of entangling the reader in a two way story  of ghosts and child custody.  Bag Of Bones delivers some of the best twists  in a Stephen King book, some that you will never see coming, and has a sad,  but necessary ending.  Bag Of Bones will leave the Stephen King fan with  tears in their eyes, and butterflies in your throat.  The novel symbolizes  the aspect of writing, and you actually think at some points of the novel,  is this Stephen King talking, or Mike Noonan?	2000-01-26

Usually I like it when Stephen King builds up this kind of suspense.  But in Christine, it just doesn't work.  For one thing, the  enitre first part of the novel Dennis-Tennage Car-Songs is written in 1st  person, from the point of view of Dennis Guilder, Arnie Cunningham's best  friend.  You know that Dennis isn't going to see any of the killings, so  King does a dumb twist, and eliminates Dennis from the entire second part  of the book, Arnie-Teenage Love-Songs, because of a football accident.  Bad  move.  Dennis is by far the most interesting character in Christine, and  when he was in the hospital, I wanted him to desperatly come back.  Finally  the killings begin, and are good.  The action is a high point in Christine.   But then we get to the dumb ending involving Arnie and his parents, (I  won't give it away, I never do).  But then again, there is an excellent  twist on the very last page that made me smile and think: Good old King,  fooling us again.  Christine isn't a bad book, and it will make many people  laugh because of its concept (crazy killer car) but it could have been a  lot better.	1999-11-22
