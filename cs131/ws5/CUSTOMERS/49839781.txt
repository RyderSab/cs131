The topic of Harry Potter came up, and although he hasn't read any of the Harry Potter books, he referred me to Mr. Granger's website.  There was an excerpt of one of the chapters there, and it was so compelling that shortly thereafter, I bought the book.   <br /> <br />This book is far from any kind of trite commentary or apology trying to \\"reconcile\\" Christianity and the Harry Potter books.  If you get this book, be prepared for a read that will go into such things as literary devices and symbolism and such.  Things like that may seem a bit abstract and over the heads of some people (and I can't say that I enjoyed such topics in school), but through these, Granger presents a very good case as to why the Harry Potter books can be accepted, enjoyed, and applauded by Christians.   <br /> <br />There are a few places where there are minor mistakes, and there is a time or two where Granger stretches his case just a bit, but all in all, this is a very good book.  I've already lent it out, and had friends of mine come back with very similar opinions of it.   <br /> <br />It will be interesting to see if this book will be rewritten after the series is over (so as to include the entire series).  I'd definitely look into getting such a future edition as well.	2005-03-15

Lewis books were \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\".  This book hasn't taken away from the appeal of those books, but this book is on a level all its own.  <br /> <br />This is a \\"reworking\\" of the tale of Psyche and Cupid, though the book has less to do with \\"Psyche and Cupid\\" per se, as it has to do with focusing on one of the historically \\"evil\\" sisters of Psyche.   <br /> <br />The tale is fascinating, and once I got into it, I couldn't put the book down.  It's a tale of a woman with a grudge against the gods.  It's a tale of disappointment and suffering.  But it's also a tale about love, and what love really is as opposed to what we think it is and what we try to make it.   <br /> <br />This book is a masterpiece, and a recommendation for anybody who wants to read something substantial without being overly \\"heavy\\".  I wish there were more books out there like this.	2004-09-20

Although it's not nearly as long as other works of Dostoyevsky's, it doesn't make it any easier.  For this reason, I'm especially glad that I chose the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation.  Not only is the book translated well, there are tons of explanitory notes that help clarify what's going on in the story, pick up on cultural and period references, as well as help show for what purpose the book was written in the first place.  Without these helps, I think I wouldn't have come away from this book with nearly as much of an understanding of it, and my rating probably would have been more in the neighbourhood of a three.  However, because I understand a lot more about what was going on, I was able to appreciate what Dostoyevsky was trying to say with this book.	2004-09-20

Although I had started \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" before this, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" was the first of Dostoyevsky's long novels that I actually finished.  Finishing it was quite a task, as this is a long and difficult novel, but I'm very glad that I did, because the book is awesome.  Furthermore, I must say that the translation was quite good, and I appreciated the historical notes and footnotes, because I feel like I understood a lot more because of it.  I also like that this edition is *compact* - not abridged, but rather small enough that it could be easily transported, rather than outsizing and outweighing a brick.  When dealing with writers as verbose as Dostoyevsky, this is a definite plus.	2004-09-20

Being quite young still, as well as not being Roman Catholic, and not having a whole lot of contact to the Roman Catholic Church, I didn't know who he was before then.  However, from that point onward, Cardinal Bernardin became more of a presence in Chicago, in good part because of his loving attitude toward his accuser, whose charges were false, and because of all the work he did trying to work for the good of all people, Roman Catholic or not.  Therefore, when he died in 1996, I, as well as most of the city of Chicago, mourned the passing of a truly great man.  <br />This book is an autobiographical \\"letter\\" from Cardinal Bernardin chronicling the last three years of his life.  It's written as somewhat of a long letter to the reader, and at once one gets drawn in to the utter love and the kindness that  radiate through the words written in the pages of this book.  <br />I had been looking for something to learn more about the kind of person Cardinal Bernardin was and the sort of things that he taught.  I was fairly dubious that I would \\"get\\" much from this book, as a lot of it is written about his battle with cancer, and with him facing an imminent death.  However, I ended up enjoying it immensely. It's just a bit eerie as well, because by the time he finishes it up, he knows his time on earth is extremely short, and the reader is kind of put in a place of seeing glimpses of the world as he must have seen it in that fall in Chicago.  Here I was, in that same city, seventeen years old, and \\"starting\\" life as a college freshman.  And yet, despite this disparity, there is something very comforting, and something that rings very, very true in the writing, something that made me devour the words, ending up reading the book in the matter of a few hours.<br />Cardinal Bernardin finished this book on 1 November 1996, and died two weeks afterward.  The Gift of Peace.  Yes.  May his spirit be eternal.	2004-06-25

She had already read it, and knowing about my love of Russia and Eastern Europe, figured that it would be up my alley.<br />As I started the book, I wasn't so sure, but even if the story does become a bit fantastical, it does make for a good read.  In Vladimir, Shteyngart does capture something very universal in his sense of not belonging.  Of course, Vladimir assumes that most of this has to do with him being a Russian-Jew immigrant to America, and lacking the kind of hard drive and ambition that his mother has that got the family to America in the first place.  <br />When Vladimir gets in too deep with both the finer things and the more base things in American life, he makes it to &quot;Prava&quot; (a slightly fictionalised Prague) of the early 1990's, ostensibly to rip off young American expats whose families have enough money to support the kind of bohemian culture these young people are trying to create there.  <br />However, even though a good number of the Americans there fully fit into Vladimir's picture that he's carefully constructed over the years, it seems that every once in awhile, there are people whom one meets that will not fit at all into that perception.  And maybe, just maybe there's a chance for Vladimir to find a place in &quot;American&quot; life.   <br />For me, being able to read a book in English with the &quot;outside looking in&quot; kind of perspective on the craziness of a lot of Americans, without being mean, was quite fun.  Also, it was fun to read a story that really does include the world past the borders of the US.	2004-06-18

I insisted on getting this Russian edition, after having had extremely good experiences with the German dictionary in the same series.  <br />This Russian dictionary did not disappoint.  Although the book is fairly large, it's not so huge that it ceases to be portable.  However, for a portable dictionary, it is also very thourough as well as up-to-date.  I'm extremely impressed with it, and have never come across another Russian/English English/Russian dictionary that I like better, though I've seen many, having been a Russian student and all.

What is nearly impossible is trying to imagine how Leningrad managed to make it through nearly three years of siege by the Nazis.<br />Besides the normal \\"fortunes of war\\", the human toll of the siege of Leningrad was horrendous, and no one will know exactly how many did fall victim to it.  <br />In the middle of all the death and destruction, there were great acts of kindness, even when it seemed like doing this would endanger one's own existance.  \\"Shurik\\" is one of these stories.  <br />At 19, Kyra Petrovskaya is already a seasoned veteran.  Formerly an actress, she's now a lieutenant in the army, working for the Leningrad civil defence at a hospital in the city.  Coming home from a long shift one night, she finds a child amidst the rubble of an apartment building near hers.  He needs help, so she decides to try to do what she can.  This child, Shurik, recovers, and manages to not only win over Kyra, but brightens the world of all of those with whom he becomes acquainted -- no little feat working at a hospital for wounded soldiers who have seen too much of death and dying in the middle of a city whose life feels like it is slowly being strangled out of it.  <br />Kyra Petrovskaya Wayne's account is touching without being over-emotional; she takes the reader to this place and time and talks about the horrors of it, but she doesn't dwell there.  There were still the living to take care of, and Leningrad wasn't going to go down to the Nazis without a fight.  She manages to tell the story of her experience with this child beautifully, while at the same time talking about her own experiences, both in Leningrad, and on the front lines helping to keep the \\"Road of Life\\" open, in order to keep Leningrad from falling.	2003-09-26

By this time, Germany is losing ground on both the Western and Eastern fronts, and Hitler and the Nazis are throwing whatever \\"manpower\\" they can into the war machine in order to try deny the inevitable.  <br />As the officers remark, these are children being sent out as cannon fodder, ill-equipped, and barely trained to hold a weapon, much less go out to battle.  The main goal for most of these kids is to try to get home alive, though everybody knows that there will be many, many who will never get to do that.  Although it's illegal, Erik takes a chance to \\"blend in\\" as an Russian soldier -- thanks to the uniform of a dead Russian boy, and his proficiency in the Russian language due to his mother's family's influence.<br />This book made for a good read.  The first part of it dealt with Erik's experiences as a Nazi conscript.  As someone who has done a fair amount of reading on WWII, I know the situation there was desperate, but something in this part of the book rang a little bit hollow.  Maybe it was the fact that in trying to mention all the horrors that were going on, it felt like instead of Erik exactly experiencing everything, it was more of an introduction to the many horrible things happening on the Eastern front for somebody who wouldn't know anything (or very little) about it.  However, this was just a minor detraction.<br />The book really took off in part two, describing Erik's experience impersonating a wounded Russian soldier, and his and Tamara's journey westward across Europe in the final, insane days of the war.  <br />Although billed as a work of fiction, the author claims that this novel is based on a true story, and that certain names and events were changed for the sake of the book.  This story is certainly compelling enough that if it is true, it would be interestingto learn more about real story behind the book.	2003-09-26

Rowling said once that the craziness surrounding the publication of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" astounded her, but since then, the publication of \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" and now \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" have topped that more spectacularly each time.  And with good reason; the Harry Potter books are wonderful, fun and fantasy-filled, entertaining for both children and adults.<br />\\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" does not disappoint.  I've read all the other books in the series, and this was the first one where I could hardly tear my eyes away.  I bought it as soon as the stores opened here in Germany, and it seemed that everywhere that I went, people noticed immediately exactly what book I was reading whilst on the train or walking around the streets of Munich.  <br />This book is a little bit of a departure from the first four.  For the first time, though the book is massive, the events of the book rely heavily upon events which took place in the previous books.  I think anybody who hasn't read the end of \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" may be a bit lost, because that is practically the starting point of all the events that come to pass in this edition.  Also, more than in any of the other books in this series, there seem to be more things left to be resolved at a later date.<br />Furthermore, as promised in all the hype, this book takes on a darker tone.  Of course, part of this is due to the fact that Voldemort is back in earnest.  Apart from that, however, Harry and Ron and Hermione are now 15, which is an awkward time to begin with, but these three, especially Harry, have already been through a lot.  This doesn't leave them unaffected, and the reader Harry dealing, for the first time, with a more sustained anger with which is sometimes hard for him to control.  Considering what he's been through, he's got every reason to have these feelings, however, he struggles with controlling the emotionsbefore they control him.  I liked this, because it makes Harry very human.  This is one of Harry's greatest strengths in the magical world, but it is also one of the things that makes him so popular with his readers.  <br />If any book could live up to the expectations and the hype surrounding it for so long, this one can do it.  It's a great tale, and the character development and dynamics that Rowling creates are wonderful.  The question left in my mind now is how all these things are going to fit in to the story as it progresses in the next two books, as it seems like the groundwork for the last, final battle against Voldemort and his minions are falling into place.	2003-06-23

I must admit that I got this book because I have fallen in love with the character of Father Mulcahy in the television show M*A*S*H.  William Christopher plays the role with a lot of love, intelligence, innocence, and humour, which made the character so close to being real.  <br />Because of this, I was interested in obtaining a bit of a picture into the life of the person behind the character, and therefore I got this book.  <br />This book deals primarily with one of the Christophers' sons, Ned.  From the very beginning, Ned was a puzzling child, behaving in somewhat atypical manners.  However, at the beginning, much of this could be chalked up to children and their own unique behaviours.  Then, as some of the problems became more pronounced, the struggle for a correct diagnosis and a successful treatment was on.  Over the years, there are a number of joys and setbacks; times when it seems like Ned is making progress, and times when everything seems to be crashing down again.  <br />The book is written in tandem by William and Barbara Christopher, with them writing alternating chapters, which is a technique that works well telling this story.  From what they have written, it is obvious how much they loved this child, each other, and their entire family.  And considering the number of autistic children there are, they are not the only parents who have struggled with this. (Though, between their intense dedication and secure financial situation, they were able to try some things that the 'average' person may not have been able to.)  <br />All in all, this was a good read.  M*A*S*H does get mentioned here and there, and a couple of Alan Alda quotes make their way in, but if one is looking to get more of a \\"backstage look\\" of the television series, this is not the book to do it with.  However, if you is looking for a book having to do with a family doing what they can for a child with special needs, this book is up your alley.	2003-06-03

As a recent convert to Orthodox Christianity from Protestantism, I'm always looking for things pertaining to the Orthodox Church as it is in America, and without the overtones of being &quot;Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, etc.&quot;  This book does that. <br />The first part of the book is that of the author's personal journey to Orthodoxy.  After decades of trying to find the &quot;True Way&quot; among various Protestant denominations, he still felt that something was *missing* in the Protestant view of the Church and of the world.  He also goes on to elaborate just what it was that seemed to be missing or contradictory in Protestant doctrine, both specifically, and in general.<br />The second part of the book is almost a handbook as to what the Orthodox church may look like to those coming from a Protestant viewpoint.  Things such as veneration of icons, formal prayers, and church tradition are discussed here in a way for those who probably have had very little experience with these things.<br />I, myself, am tickled to read about others' journeys to (and within) Orthodoxy, particularly in America.  I just sent this book in a package to my mom.  I don't know if she will read it, but if she does, I hope that she will at least come away knowing that me becoming Orthodox has everything to do with the church, and very little to do with me being fascinated with Russia or whatnot.	2003-02-05

I bought this book a long time ago, thinking it looked interesting, but it was probably two years before I actually got around to reading it.  When I did, I just about devoured it, not because it is the best book in the world, but because it captures a particular time so well, and the choices one comes to in building a life philosophy.  <br />Set in Japan in 1969 and 1970, it's the story of a young college student, Toru, and his \\"relationship\\" with a girl, Naoko, who was the girlfriend of his best friend, who killed himself a couple of years before.  Toru's life isn't charmed, but he's making it through, despite his shortcomings and mistakes.  Naoko has a harder time dealing with life itself, with her own and others' imperfections, and this inability to cope with the everyday eventually leads her down her own path.  Toru attempts to understand her, be there for her, and love her as best he can.  Being only 19 himself (at the beginning of the book), he's got a lot of growing up to do and decisions to make himself.  In the end, he probably makes the only decision he can make without going crazy himself, but this is also not without a great deal of sadness.<br />The one gripe I have about this book is that there is quite a few sex scenes...  This is played off, in part, to Toru's \\"craziness\\", but still was kind of weird.  What I did enjoy, though, was the description of the few people closest to Toru, his roommate, whom Toru has nicknamed \\"Stormtrooper\\", Toru's only \\"friend\\" in the dorms, this guy's girlfriend, Midori, Naoko, and Naoko's roommate.  Each is a different type of \\"crazy\\".  Some have even realized as much, and it's interesting to see how each character deals with that in themselves, and as it pertains to living with the rest of this crazy world.  And no, not everybody makes it.	2003-01-09

Irina Ratushinskaya is a Russian poet/writer who became a political prisoner in the Soviet Union due to her dissident activities.  I happened to come across another book of hers, &quot;A Tale of Three Heads&quot; and fell in love with it, and so I was interested in finding something else by her to read.<br />Whereas the book &quot;Grey is the Color of Hope&quot; is about her experiences in prison, most of this book is about Ratushinskaya's life before she was arrested.  She talks about growing up in Odessa, and about the life of her husband when he was younger, how he worked to overcome difficulties walking, and how he loved making fire.  Although religion, being forbidden under the Soviets, did not play a large part in their lives growing up, instilled in both of them was a thirst for the truth, and a sense of decency and justice -- things which, as they got older, they saw the Soviets try to do away with as well.  (Of course Lenin was a genius in physics!)<br />For these reasons, they had to decide to play along with this system or to try to resist it - they chose to resist.  Coming together with others of like mind, they hoped to help circulate forbidden texts, such as those of Solzhenytsin, to do anything to loosen the grip the Soviets had on the minds of the people.  Ratushinskaya is a poet herself, and her poetry was also circulated; one of the reasons that she served much more time in prison as her husband.<br />She did survive, and after her release she and her husband were forced to flee to England.  <br />This book, however, is a well-written chronicle of what will bring a person (or in this case two) to try to fight against a tyranny that they have almost no hope of toppling, and yet they struggle on anyway.	2003-01-05

As college students, they rebelled against the old order, and came upon a band that seemed to bring with it something entirely new - The Beatles.<br />They all became friends, so much so that Astrid got engaged to Stu Sutcliffe and took the first professional photos of the band, and Klaus would later design the covers for the Beatles' albums \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Anthology\\" as well as play bass on albums of Ringo, George, and John, after the Beatles' breakup.<br />This two-volume set is absolutely gorgeous.  The first volume, besides photographs and documents, goes into the story of what kind of state Germany was in after the war, and why it was that the Beatles' type of music attracted many young people to it, as well as telling how the band came to get there, and what kind of conditions these very young men were willing to put up with in order to pursue their passion of music.  Most of the text is by Voormann, but George Harrison and Paul McCartney also wrote short pieces to go into this book.<br />The second volume is a collection of art pertaining to the Beatles done by Voormann.  I saw Voormann and some of these pictures at Beatlefest 2001 in Chicago, and these are interesting too, as something that belongs in part of this collection.<br />The main problem with this book is that it is a prohibitively expensive limited edition.  However, it is a perspective of the era and the Beatles that is carefully done by people who have known the Beatles since this time, and were qualified in putting a project like this together.	2002-10-30

What he has to say is definately worth thinking about, especially for anyone who has felt an emptyness or spiritual lacking in most religion in America today.  <br />My problem was not in his message, but oftentimes in the way Schaeffer came across with it.  In some places, it seemed like the book was more a collection of essays strung together to make a book.  I understand his stance on abortion, but to compare it (especially in combination with prenatal testing) as being on par with the Nazi Eugenics program at EVERY mention did get to be a bit tiresome, especially for somebody like me, who does not need to be convinced of this.  For somebody who did not agree with him, they'd probably be put off enough by reading that so many times, that they would either not read any further, or just use that as a reason not to think about the rest of his message.<br />Furthermore, there were far too many quotes that were far too long.  Some editor should have looked to see that he had quoted the same passage of seven or so Bible verses in the space of about 2 or 2 1/2 pages.  I know he had slightly different points to make with it, but he should assume that his reader is smart enough to retain what they had read for the 2-3 minutes it took to get from his first point to his second point.  <br />Normally, it shouldn't make a difference, but the font for this book was TERRIBLE.  It was distracting and ugly, and made the book, literally, harder to read.    <br />Again, I feel his message is pertinent and important, and there were passages of the book, especially near the end, that were brilliant.  Had this book been written a bit differently, it would have been an easy five stars.  As important as the ideas he has here are, those who are going to read this book through don't need to be convinced with the tone of his arguments, and those who don't agree aren't going to read it through.	2002-10-30

Therefore, it is disturbing to read such an account as this; that one can see the mechanisms that were systematically used to protect the perpetrators of these crimes, rather than the slew of victims.<br />This book is NOT a book condemning Catholism or Christianity.  I am not Catholic myself, but I have enough respect for Christianity and the Catholic Church, that had it been merely thus, I probably wouldn't have wasted my time reading it.  <br />With the persistance of the staff of the Boston Globe, though, much of this information, which was previously off-limits, has been opened and researched.  This book is a product of that research, and without drowning the reader in tons of details, goes into many aspects of this story - how the story broke, victims' stories, profiles of some of the most heinous perpetrators, the Catholic culture around Boston, and the heirarchical structure of the Catholic Church, and the effects this scandal has had on the Catholic Church in America and in the world.  <br />As late as this has come to many people, I am glad that somebody had the nerve to pursue the story.  For those who still want to believe that this isn't a major problem, remember that what is written here is just Boston's story, and just a small bit, at that.  The priests who committed these crimes are criminals, and should be recognized as such, both inside and outside the Catholic Church.	2002-10-22

Those looking for a book &quot;Orthodoxy for Dummies&quot; will not find it in this book.  Although some stuff is explained in the book, it is because it is part of the story, and pertinent to it.<BR> <BR>This, however, is the story of how a group of former &quot;Campus Crusade for Christ&quot; leaders came to find the Orthodox faith after being disillusioned with the many flavours of Protestantism.  They were intent on trying to find the &quot;original Church&quot;, and through scholarship, prayer, and setbacks, they, along with about 2000 people, came to be Orthodox.<br />Not everything experienced was easy.  First of all, these people were surprised at what they had found in their researching the early Church.  Had this research not been done through many people, with the prevalent opinions on Orthodoxy in America, they probably would have thought that they had erred.  Then, when it came down to a matter of logistics, it almost seemed that they had come down the path that they had for next to nil.  However, sometimes when one experiences the deepest disappointments, one has to hold on just a bit longer to experience the joy.  This is what happened here, and though they don't want to change the church, they are trying to help it be less misunderstood, especially in the American setting.<br />I couldn't put this book down.  You could say that I am biased, also being an Orthodox convert with an Evangelical background, but for me it was nice to read something about Orthodoxy in an American context, which goes into the reasons behind why other Americans have converted.	2002-10-20

She's read the whole series, and has even written the author on a couple of occasions.<br />I read the book to make her happy, and it wasn't too bad.  My major complaint, I guess, is thinking back to my own high school days and comparing them with those of Mia.  I know Mia feels like a freak, but there are other tragedies in the world other than being flat-chested, which gets mentioned just about every third page.  Sometimes I just wanted to yell \\"Enough Already!\\"<br />However, for the most part, the book was pretty entertaining.  It's interesting to see how a character reacts to NOT wanting to be a princess, rather than the assumption that any girl would be delighted.  Mia's definately a girl living in the current times, what with broken homes, and instant messaging, and friends who, even at that age, want to psychoanalize everything.  Yet, this is the world that Mia holds dear, and this is the story of how she gets thrown for a huge loop.	2002-10-20

As a convert to Orthodoxy, this is one of the books that was repeatedly recommended to me as a \\"must read\\" for getting to know a little more about the Orthodox church.  I finally read the book (after about a year of attending an Orthodox church), and it came as somewhat of a let-down.<br />In the very beginning, Mathewes-Green states that the main reason that she became Orthodox was because her husband, who had been an Episcopalian priest, felt his heart coming to Orthodoxy.  I'm sure, with all the writing that she has now done about Orthodoxy, that her heart is in the Orthodox church, but, throughout much of the book, I got the feeling of her being somewhat just \\"along for the ride\\".  <br />This is the account of the third year of their mission church, done as a sort of journal through a church year.  Because it is the third year, the reader misses all the hardships of the first, and trying to figure things out, as well as the \\"new familiarity\\" of it all in a second.  <br />I also missed things like people's reactions to their religion.  They home-school their kids, and so I missed episodes like the kids having to explain to teachers and cafeteria people at their school that no, the kids aren't vegan, but there are certain days that they aren't supposed to eat certain things.  (Then again, her kids were a little bit older than grammar school, but you get the picture.)  Or trying to explain the difference of date of certain holidays (Pascha -the biggest Orthodox celebration in the year- comes to mind immediately).  Or trying to explain that no, you aren't Russian, Greek, or Jewish.  The people in the book were either members of their church or friends who weren't going to make a fuss if the family were Orthodox, Episcopalian, Luthern, Baptist, Jewish, or whatever.<br />Overall, I found the book interesting, and I can't say that I wasn't happy to finally read it, but as for the kind of book that I was expecting, that it was not.  Furthermore, if you are looking for something to basically explain Orthodoxy, this probably isn't the book for you either.  However, if you are looking for a story about a certain parish's experiences getting a little more settled into its existance, here's a book for you.	2002-10-20

Instead of living almost completely in the \\"second society\\" of newly rich and expatriates that Matthew Brzezinski describes in his book \\"Casino Moscow\\", or being almost completely on one's own as in Lori Cidlyo's book \\"All the Clean Ones Are Married\\", Randolph manages to pull off a fine balance between the two.  This balance is maintained in Randolph's writing as well.  She's a Western journalist coming to write about \\"everyday\\" Russia, and she tries hard to get the real story.  One of the things that impressed me is that, although she used a translator, it was more to make sure that what she was reporting was accurate.  There is at least one point in the book where she mentions about her translator not translating a certain question to her liking.  Most Western reporters would have no clue if this were to happen, and I think it seriously limits our view of the world.<br />Randolph tackles a different subject as it pertains to the Russia she experienced in the book.  There's one about the problems with housing, and attitudes toward private ownership (especially of land), as well as chapters about religion, cults, women's issues, homosexuals, the state of the arts (case in point: ballet), as well as others.  What is impressive is the time she took to track people down and have serious interviews with them, rather than be satisfied with fluff pieces that could be easily made into simple anecdotes or pieces to feed into current stereotypes of Russia.<br />When reading this book, one can think that the conditions in Russia are unfathomably bad.  However, it's not like the Russians can stop living because life there is crazy.  Randolph starts the book with a story about her returning home one grey winter's day.  She looks up and is struck by the beauty of a blazing light in the distance, and after a moment realizes that it is the reflection of the last rays of the sun on the golden crosses of a church.  She compares this experience with her stay in Russia.  As horrible as a lot of life there seems, there is something there that is enduring and beautiful.  This is the sense that I came away with after finishing this book.  I only wish that it was a little bit more current, as much has happened in Russia even after her last interviews in 1995.	2002-10-18

However, the story of the White Rose is such that it doesn't need any fictionalization in order to make it fascinating.  Furthermore, by fictionalizing it, the story loses much of its power.<br />The drawback with some historical accounts is that one can lose the personalities within the events.  This book is geared toward younger readers, and with the fictionalization tries to bring people closer to the characters.  This book is centered on the character of Hans Scholl and takes place in the days he is in prison, with flashbacks to the \\"major events\\" that led up to his imprisonment.  <br />My critisisms of this of this book are quite major.  In the first place, there seems to be only three people in the White Rose, those being Hans, Alexander Schmorell, and Sophie Scholl.  There is a fourth major character in the book, a fictional character, a \\"friend\\" of Hans', who, in contrast to the White Rose, follows the Nazis.  Although this person is fictional, he plays a key role in many of the flashbacks, which I find annoying.  However, more annoying than that are the characterizations of the members of the White Rose.  Alex and Sophie seem to have nothing better to do than to flirt with each other.  Hans seems to be going through a mental crisis whilst in prison, which bothers me because every factual report is to the contrary.  However, for many \\"small\\" instances, sticking to the facts didn't seem to be a huge priority.<br />As for the other members of the White Rose, they are hardly mentioned.  Christoph Probst is mentioned a few times, probably because the author could not avoid the fact that Christoph was imprisoned with the Scholls and was executed on the same day.  Professor Huber was mentioned, but didn't really have a role in the book.  I find it especially troublesome, though, that Willi Graf, who undoubtedly was a part of the core of the White Rose, and would be tortured and executed as such, was only mentioned twice.  Not only that, but once it seemed almost an afterthought, in a sentence that went somewhat like the following - \\"Others, too, were tried and convicted for being members of the White Rose, like the student Willi Graf, who was also executed\\". <br />Although finding books in English about the White Rose is extremely difficult at this time, this is not a book that one is going to find particularly enlightening about the group.  I rated this book two stars because each book gets one star automatically, and the second star is one for effort.  The White Rose is undoubtedly something that deserves to be known about, but this book doesn't do much to help that cause.	2002-10-05

Born into an Orthodox Christian family, he was a huge joy to his parents, who truly adored this precious child.  However, his family's joy would turn to despair as, shortly after his sixth birthday, he is killed in an accident.<br />This book is an account of Andrew's life as well as an account of how his family, with the help of God, try to struggle through their loss.  Andrew was a child who was completely convinced in the reality of God and His work all around us, and the knowledge that the end of one's earthly life need not mean &quot;The End&quot;.  Through their pain and suffering, Andrew's parents slowly begin to redouble their efforts to listen to what God is saying, and it is through this that they are able to continue on in hope, in faith, and in love.	2002-10-05

It is, however, a more 'realistic' 'happily ever after', which suits the book well, and which I particularly liked.<br />The only thing that annoyed me just a little was the position that Card seemed to take on religion (it doesn't matter) and the Orthodox Church (which he doesn't seem to think too highly of, although it plays quite a role in the book.)  Coming from where I am, this should perhaps bug me more, but it wasn't too bad, and it's nice to read a 'fun' book from time to time.	2002-09-29

The Nazis were willing to murder anybody, who, for any reason, did not fit in to their ideology or view of the world.  With this book, there is a more clear demonstration of that - yes, a couple of the stories are about Jewish children, there is also a story concerning the plight of a Polish child, one about a gypsy girl, and a child's view of the horrendous occurence at Lidice, Czechoslovakia.  The stories about the Jewish children are also varied; one escaped via the Kindertransport, one story was about girls hidden in a convent, and another whose father was featured in a very famous photo that made it out of Germany to tip people off to the kinds of things happening there.  <br />My main gripe about the book is fairly minor.  I enjoyed the pictures and the background given to each story, but every once in awhile I felt that the text was patronising.  Mind you, this is targeted towards a juvenile audience, but if one believes that the children that will be reading this book are mature enough to deal with this type of material, they probably are not in too terrible need of some of the simpler explanations, and I found these a bit distracting from the focus of the text. <br />Overall, it is a very good book that serves a subject that is often neglected.	2002-09-29

It was something that moved me, because it told of how, in the face of the worst inhumanity (in this case, the Soviet gulag), there are still people who still insist on doing what is right, and doing whatever possible to serve God and serve others.  <br />The first two sections of the book is comprised of different stories, from different people, about Father Arseny.  The last section is a set of stories, miracles actually, of others, most of whom had some sort of contact or knowledge of Father Arseny.  Many are quite fantastic, but how can one truly explain the power of faith?	2002-07-07

Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was a bad book, but on the other hand, I don't think that there was anything particularly great about it either.<br />The author comes up with an interesting scenerio, that of what would happen if people, through some fluke of happenstance, were able to remember much more than normal, and how it would affect their lives.<br />The result, however, was disappointing, as the book seemed to get just as muddled in the middle as the characters who got bogged down in the flood of memories.  There's a reason that writers are warned against using too many flashbacks in writing, and having a whole book of such tends to prove the point.	2002-07-07

There are some who will look down on Stephen King because of his popularity, or for the fact that many of his books get classified as being 'Horror'.  However, as a writer, Stephen King has truly been a force now for many, many years.<br />This book is unique, because it isn't a strict memoir, nor is it merely a writer's manual.  It succeeds because it is both, giving the reader insight both into the mechanics of the craft as well as an example of the personality that is infused into the writing.  Both are essential for a great book.  If books could merely be printed using an 'idea machine', you know that we would have invented some such already.  At the same time though, anybody endeavouring to write needs to have the type of tools and discipline to be able to write something readable.  <br />I would recommend this book to anybody who is thinking of doing any sort of paid writing, because it is truly a glimpse into writing and a writer's world that isn't often offered.	2002-07-07

I liked this book well enough reading it, even though it is a bit slow for my style.  Actually, in the present, not a whole lot happens other than the main character has made his way to the Crimea on the pretense of trying to find a specimen of butterfly that is said to be extinct, but if he finds, he will be paid a pretty penny for.  <br />However, there's more to the book than a butterfly place.  J. (the main character) is a player.. He makes his money buying things, selling things, transporting things across borders, etc.  &quot;Professional smuggler&quot;, if you will.  He thinks he's the master of his game.  <br />And maybe he is one of the masters of the goods-running, but he wasn't expecting V., a beautiful Russian woman, who played on his feelings, then used him to escape Turkey and return to her native Russia.  J. is convinced that somehow, since she has managed to contact him through the post, that he can study the art of letter writing to somehow find favour with her once again.<br />With such a scenerio, the 'more classic' writing style fits well.  Reading this, one can almost imagine that one is back in the late 1800's, despite the fact that the map of Europe has changed drastically, and one of J.'s wares that comes up many times are night-vision-goggles.  At the same time though, had I not a lot of &quot;down time&quot; to actually sit and read, I'm not sure that I would have had the patience needed to enjoy the 'atmosphere' of the book.	2002-07-07

However, it was the faith that all of these students had, that they had to do what was right, despite the danger, that is truly inspiring. <br />This book is well-researched, well-written, and quite readable, even for people who don't know much about the White Rose to begin with.  My main gripe with the book is that, although it is not as bad as a lot of stuff about the White Rose, it tends to idolize the Scholls to begin with, and when introducing the other members, especially Alexander Schmorell and Willi Graf.  Later on in the book, when more is written about these people, there seems to be more of a balance in what is said.  <br />And though a lot of people seem only to be interested in the leaflets themselves, or the more 'political' motivations of the group, I, for one, was delighted with the chapter about Russia, because in it it was able to portray more of the \\"emotional\\" reasons for the actions of the White Rose, and throws some color onto what could be regarded as \\"boring history\\".<br />I just wish that this book were not out of print in English, as it is amazingly hard to find, and it is something that I would recommend to almost anyone who is interested in history, interested in ethics, religion, or just wants to read an unbelievably moving tale.	2002-07-03

Who would have known that looking at very inactive sloths could be so entertaining?  For instance, the scene at the playground is precious.   <br />As if the illustrations weren't enough, the story is good, and Sparky, the character introduced as a contrast to the other sloths and a disruption to their routine, was able to &quot;save the day&quot; without any of the characters having to completely change their personality.	2001-09-09

Yes, it is a retelling of the &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; story, and yes, there are probably 50 &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; books out there, but this one has an original spark to it.  <br />In all of his books of his that I've read, Philip Pullman imbues a smart type of wit that is still acceptable for children, but makes his books all the more interesting for more advanced readers.  For example, in this book, there is a scene depicting the princess and Jacques falling in love.  To illustrate the problem of it, both of them are standing on opposite edges of the page, looking away from each other, wondering (with cartoon bubbles) when &quot;the question&quot; is going to pop up.  (I don't want to say specifically what they said, because it wouldn't sound the same here.)  I burst out laughing at this scene, first because it is so comic, but also because it strikes a chord in real life as well.  <br />All the characters are funny, in their own type of way, without being overdone.  Puss is confident, Jacques shy, the princess lovestruck, the ogre evil (and unedjucated!).  These characters really make the story happen, probably as they were supposed to in the first place!<br />Even if you don't like fairy-tales, give this book a chance!	2001-08-16

I thought the title was kind of cheesy, but I finally did read it, and I am happy I did.  <br />The story is that of a young girl, named Sara, who is looking for the perfect &quot;no-present&quot; for her Russian grandmother.  In this search, Sara reflects on many of the wonderful things about her grandmother, and finally comes up with a &quot;no-present&quot; for her grandmother, &quot;Catherine the Great&quot;.<br />The story is not just about Sara's search, but also brings into light some of the characters' histories.  Grandma is &quot;Catherine&quot; because when they came to America, &quot;Ekaterina&quot; just seemed too odd.  Even in this &quot;New World&quot;, grandma has managed to keep much of her Russian-ness about her, speaking in Russian and keeping Russian traditions.  Sara is definitely more &quot;American&quot;, but still loves her grandmother very much, and has an interest in keeping some of her heritage about herself as well.<br />I very much enjoyed the occasional phrases in Russian.  I know to many people, these are unreadable and extraneous, but they are very sweet if you are fortunate enough to be able to read them.	2001-07-13

During the Christmas 2000 season, this book literally flew off the shelves.  Somewhere in that time, I actually took the time to read it, and even used it for a story hour at least once.  <br />The illustrations are eye-catching partly because they are sparse, but they are also really cute.  The characterization of Olivia is really cute..  She's a typical 4 year old, getting into just about everything, boundless energy, and wearing her parents out.<br />It is on this last point that I found some exception with this book.  I feel that the book ends on somewhat of a weird tone, that being with Olivia and her parents exchanging good-night \\"I love you anyway\\"s.  I think it was meant to be cute, what with Olivia being a rambunctious pig and all, but it seemed to me to bring into the picture the fear that parents, especially, can choose not to love their kids sometimes.	2001-06-12

However, none of them presents as a complete a picture as this one.  <br />I think it would probably help in reading this book if you already &quot;know&quot; the story of Helen Keller, because while Dash talks about things like &quot;the miracle at the well&quot;, she does not make these events the entire focus of this book.  Even in Helen's lifetime, people were amazed by the stunning events of her childhood, and seem to think that that was all there was to her.<br />In this biography, Dash sets out to talk not just about Helen Keller's childhood, but her whole life.  She talks about Helen's disillusionment with what college was about.  In all the books I had read about Helen Keller before, including her own &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;, I did not know that she was a Socialist or that there were many times when she and Annie were uncertain as to what they would do in the future.  Furthermore, though I knew that in later years there was a woman named Polly Thompson who also helped Helen, I never knew anything more about her than her name.  In this book, I finally was able to learn more about things that were never mentioned in other &quot;kids'&quot; biographies, and I was glad of that.<br />The only thing that was a little sad was that I realized more that Helen Keller was human, rather than just the prodigious child who could overcome anything that I kept reading about when I was younger.  She grew up, and she had her share of sorrows and joys, ambitions and setbacks.  If you are really interested in her entire life, this is the book to read.	2001-06-05

I had been meaning to read this book for quite awhile, but never quite got around to it until today.  This book is a quick read.  (I think it only took me about 45 minutes to read from cover to cover.  However, I didn't take time to ponder most of the illustrations.)<br />Kate is a great character.  Strangely enough, the title poem &quot;Hey World, here I am&quot; is probably the one I liked the least in the whole book.  I haven't read any of the other books that include Kate, but this book does stand alone.  With this book, the reader gets an insight into Kate that is refreshing.  <br />Rather than using long journal entries, Kate relates little things in her world through poems and through short stories.  Some of these things are quite moving, such as the time that Kate's mother yells at her to clean her room.  Later, Kate's mother comes back to apologize, saying she had a bad day at work, etc, and that she didn't mean to snap like that.  Kate's observation on the situation is that she could deal with being snapped at, but having to deal with her mother's sadness was something much harder.  Other observations are more joyful, such as the hope for spring (in February in Canada!) or being happy to have a best friend like her friend Emily.  <br />I think this is a wonderful book.  Don't let it's shortness put you off.  Not every book is meant to be 300 pages.	2001-03-24

It didn't take me that long to finish the entire book, but I think it was halfway before I felt that the book really got moving.<br />Robbie was a problem for me as well.

Besides this, Robbie can take the time to become philisophical, much older for his years, such as in his musings about how &quot;Violet&quot; got changed to &quot;Vile&quot;, etc, but can't seem to figure out up from down in other instances.<br />There are quite a few things that seem extraneous, and don't help to move forward the plot very well.  <br />The other thing that irks me is that Robbie's father is JUST TOO PERFECT.  I know that he's the preacher, etc, but nobody is THAT perfect.	2001-03-17

Most of this book is about bygone days of imperial Russia.  However, instead of being a typical &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; book or &quot;How the Royal Family Lived&quot;, the passages here are first person accounts, recorded as memories, or as the actual journal entries.  <br />Through this, the reader gets a picture of what it was like living in the upper echelon of society in the latter half of the 19th century, and the early 20th.  It is striking and gorgeous.<br />This is the land and the society that these people later had to flee, and the author, Obolensky, grew up in the Russian emigre community in France.  <br />There was a couple problems that found with this book.  While the descriptions of these people's lives were fascinating, it wasn't a page turner, and for that reason, it took me a long time to actually sit down and FINISH this book.<br />A major problem with it, too, was it's heavy reliance on French.  I know that some things are not translateable, and I know the author knows French very well (besides English), and I know that French was the language of many courts and of international diplomacy in that day, but it seemed like there were so many times when the author's point would be punctuated by a phrase in French, which did absolutely no good for me, since I don't speak or read this language.<br />The third thing that kind of irked me was that Obolensky spends probably 4/5 of the book in aristocratic Russia from 1875-1920, having many perspectives represented, but when it actually comes to the &quot;exile&quot; part, the only representation is his own experiences, and they seem, somehow, not to be nearly as in-depth.  (Then again, he was jumping over HUGE periods of time.)<br />Despite its flaws, this book does serve to recall a time which is fast fading in memory.  Most of the &quot;authors&quot; of this book died more than 40 years ago, and this perspective is unique to try to comprehend.	2001-03-17

Anna has been reunited with her mother and her father, but it's been a long time since they've been a family.  <br />Anna is working to be more normal, even though that is hard, considering that she is two years behind in school, she is used to being scared of everything, and she doesn't have to hide in the attic anymore.<br />She strikes up a friendship with an odd older lady, who, Anna and her parents first assume to be German, but then find out that she is also Jewish and suffered under the Nazis as well.<br />This book is an incredibly fast read, but also striking in its language, which is largely unembellished, and serves its purpose well.  <br />This is the new Netherlands, though, and there is hope for Anna and her family, as well as Anna's friend.	2001-03-17

I picked up this book because the cover looked appealing, and I was intrigued about what this book may be about.  I started reading it, and I was really quite impressed.  I was starting to get notions in my head about using this book for storytime at work or donating it to my elementary school, but kept reading and changed my mind.<br />Rylant evokes a great sense of the wonderful in the &quot;ordinary&quot;.  Little thing which we so often take for granted.  I loved that about this book.  However, I was really put off about how she tried to tie that in with the child's own being.  I didn't like how she made it sound like &quot;then one day, YOU happened&quot;, (just like a flower blooming!) because there IS a great difference, in my eyes, in a child being born and a loaf of bread being made.  <br />It could have been really wonderful, but this analogy left me with a bad feeling in the end.	2001-02-12

Montgomery's classic stories - The Story Girl, The Golden Road, and Kilmeny of the Orchard.  In one way, I'm not quite sure what &quot;Kilmeny&quot; is doing in the set, if you wanted to keep with the &quot;Avonlea&quot; theme, but on the other hand, it does the other stories no harm in being there.  <br />This book was published with the cover picture from the Disney Channel series &quot;Avonlea&quot;.  I love the volume, and am sorry to see that it is currently out of print.  It would have been nice to see if they had other compliation volumes.	2001-01-31

This is the first book by Orson Scott Card that i have read, and i found it to be pretty good.  I would have liked to have started with one of the Ender books, but this is an interesting place to start as well, being as all of Ender's glory is referred to in the past. <br />I enjoyed the characterizations of the kids.  They obviously went through a lot in Battle School and in the previous wars, and now that they are back, they are struggling to be kids and to be human again.  (That is, if they ever were.)<br />One of the gripes that i have with this book is that i am never sure about time.  Petra's age is given, but i am never sure how old Bean really is - and with growing kids, i think this makes a difference.  I think there was a mention in there of Bean not looking older than 6.  Well, if you are 10 and being mistaken for six or if you are 13 and being mistaken for 6, this makes a difference.  In the same way, the period of time in which this takes place is fuzzy too.  We know that it is sometime a couple centuries in the future, but the countries of the world look pretty much the same, and when Card refers to past wars, generals, etc, they are 20th century at the latest.  I know, i know, there was the Hedgemon and the Formic wars and stuff, but i didn't READ the Ender books, and seeing a map so similar to the one today is just strange.<br />The other criticism of this book that i have is of the national characters.  There is a lot that Card writes that is true, but even if i believe that the US is &quot;a nation in decline&quot;, i don't think it will be as fast as Card makes it out to be.  Similarly, i don't believe that Russia will be in the same situation that she is in now in 300 years' time..  Again, it may be that the maps will change more dramatically.<br />Overall, i really did enjoy the book.	2001-01-29

The Soviets were guilty of this as well, though this is not as well known to Americans.<br />This is the story of a young girl who is a victim of the Soviet forced-labor camps.  Her family did nothing wrong, but with the Russian invasion of Poland, her parents and grandparents were considered &quot;capitalists&quot; and therefore deported to Siberia.  <br />This book is very well written.  The characters are very well deveoped, which is especially important since this book is autobiographical.  Reading this gives a real sense of how far out in the middle of nowhere these people were.  There is the beauty of this pristine land versus the terror which haunts the people who have been sent here, as well as the true desolation of the place.  In time, Esther, who is 15 by the end of the book, really feels that this is the place her life is, rather than Poland, where she lived before, even though this is the place of her imprisonment.  Hautzig also does a good job of describing the constant suffering and scrabbling for humanity that these people went through as political prisoners.  It was a hopeless situation, but the one thing that they could least give up was hope.<br />This is one of the very few children's (or young adult) books that does focus on what was happening in the Soviet Union during this time.  There are many kids books which focus on the Germans and the Holocaust, but that was only part of the story, and to forget the rest of these people who suffered and died because of the same sort of tyranny is an affront to them.	2001-01-09

Her descriptions of Chicago, i know are pretty good, so if that is an indication of what Russia is like, i would expect those to be good as well.  <br />Luckily, this isn't a romance novel, because i think that would have ruined a splendid adventure. However, there's quite a few threads of love and lust that weave themselves around and one is never sure of where they are going to lead until the very end, though there's at least one which doesn't seem to add much to the  plot, so i am still not sure what Christmas' purpose was with that.  <br />However, the people were never quite what they seemed, and everybody had a few surprises along the way, which kept the book flowing and entertaining.	2001-01-03

Here are a couple examples:<br />No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.<br />Friendship after love is like smoke after fire.<br />He who accepts slavery once will never be free.	2001-01-03

They feel that they are so lost that there is no hope for redemption for themselves, and so they act out as a way to vent all the frustration and anger that is a result of these things.       At first I really didn't like this book, but the further I read, the more into it I got.  In a lot of ways, it portrays a realistic picture of the kind of world that a lot of kids nowadays are living in.  I could identify with these &quot;misfits&quot; quite a bit myself.  <br />The problem is, none of the four &quot;misfits&quot; seem to have enough strength of character to try to halt the events which occur.  And, while this is quite common, it seems that we can read about these kids every day in the newspaper, rather than have to read about them in a (fiction) book.  However, there do seem to be a lot of people who have no understanding how these kids get into these situations, and this book can maybe be used to help enlighten them.  <br />Even so, by the end, i was caught up in the story and really hoping that by some miracle they could find a way out...	2001-01-02

The illustrations, though, are breathtaking, and i am sure that there are a lot of younger kids who could make up their own intricate stories just based on the pictures.  It's nice to see, as well, a fairy tale type book where there is a heroine who is saving the prince (or tsarovitch, in this case), though i guess it would have been nice to see Katya battling a dragon or something rather than just making wishes.  Oh, well.  It's a delightful book nonetheless.  :)	2001-01-02

It takes the reader to a time and a place that not many people have experienced and that isn't terribly well-known.  The book is well, but simply, written, making it a good book for younger readers, but also for kids who are looking for a good story.  It is a very heartwarming story.<br />My major complaint with the book is the fact that the author seems to almost go overboard condemning the &quot;normal&quot; methods of teaching.  Miss Agnes obviously did a great job in that school, but there are a lot of teachers who do just fine keeping the desks in rows and reading stories out of &quot;normal&quot; (eg Dick and Jane) textbooks.  For a lot of teachers, they really don't have a choice about it, with resources being limited and everything.  And for Marie, who is looking forward to a life of getting married and having kids and keeping house, there is almost the idea of &quot;poor Marie&quot;.  Sure, it's great that Miss Agnes could help show that there was more to the world, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with a girl, especially in that kind of environment, to want a more domestic life.<br />These were pretty minor flaws, all things considered.  The book had me hooked, and i thoroughly enjoyed it.  :)  I would be interested in reading more books by this author about Alaska if the chance presented itself.	2001-01-02

The story is about a girl named Janie, who, at the onset of the story is well known in her family and at school for telling fibs.  Even Janie isn't quite sure why she does this, nor is she sure why she doesn't seem to lie around her godmother Tillie or her brother David, the only two people who seem to take a real interest in Janie as herself.  <br />  Janie is in junior high, as is this girl named Lisa, who is the &quot;star&quot; of the class, having famous parents and having been in magazine ads and such herself.  Janie can't understand why Lisa suddenly befreinds her, but she is ecstatic.  However, Janie notices that Lisa also lies, and is deeply hurt and confused about why she does so.<br />  In the middle of this enters Janie's godmother, Tillie.  Tillie decides to buy a very small island in order to &quot;get away from it all&quot; and knows that this is the type of place that Janie will love and where she can spend time with Janie.  It is Tillie's time and love and support that help Janie learn some things about herself.     Over time, this book has become a little bit dated, with references to some things, like women always wearing hats, that just don't happen anymore, but it is a good book with a good lesson that is still very relevant today.  :)	2000-12-30

Sure, if you want to prove a point that people and society are evil, then you could probably use this book.  The characters have no redeeming qualities to them, and so when their lives slide into ruin, you can maybe feel sorry for them, but you aren't torn up that such bad things happened to them.

It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly.  The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous.  I had to read this book for a class, and disliked it so much, i didn't even remember that I had read it (repressing it in my mind).  It wasn't until one of my friends who had also been in that class reminded me that we had read it that I even remembered that i HAD read it.

It is the story of a little boy who wants to go to school, but his mother says that he is too young.  One day, when his mother and father are at work, he notices that his grandmother, who is supposed to be watching him, has fallen asleep.  So Philipok goes to school, and it is quite an adventure getting there.  He does arrive, and is afraid to go in, because the teacher might be angry, but he is also afraid to go back and face the things which hindered his journey.  I think this book portrays that fear well - that fear that comes when one is doing something that they maybe aren't supposed to, but have gone so far that it's just as scary, if not scarier, going back.  As for the &quot;moral&quot; of the book, i'm a bit torn. On one hand, I feel that going to school is a noble endeavour, and that it wasn't wrong for Philipok to want to go, but on the other hand, i'm not sure that i totally agree with the way things turned out at the end.  Children SHOULD listen to their parents, and they meant him no harm in saying that he wasn't old enough.  However, i do think the book was pretty good.  The illustrations, while not bright, are very intricate and set the mood well.  I love the very Russian setting, and the use of Russian words (with Cyrillic characters) in some of the illustrations.  There was the minor glitch, however, when Philipok is spelling his name.  This book was translated (this IS Tolstoy) and when Philipok spells his name for the teacher, he spells it &quot;Filipok&quot; - which is closer to the Russian letters, rather than Philipok, which is how it is spelled in the book.  I know, it's a minor glitch, but it bugged me a little nonetheless, especially with the emphasis on knowing the alphabet toward the end of the story.	2000-11-28

This is the main focus throughout the book, but it is so much more as  well.  Helter Skelter is spellbinding, and keeps you entranced throughout  the book, from the murders, to the 'motive' to the courtroom scenes, as  well as everything in between.  It was recommended to me because i am a  Beatles fan, and it is interesting to see how it was interpreted and  twisted by Manson.  With all the talk about violence in the media, violent  toys, etc, causing these spectacular school schootings, it is interesting  to see how the Beatles' music could be interpreted as being one of the  causes to these murders.	2000-03-30
