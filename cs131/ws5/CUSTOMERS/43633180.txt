This book was an interesting read, and I tried some of the ideas suggested in it. I can't say that I was walking through walls, or travelling through space. However, by trying the ideas suggested in this book I began to have extremely lucid dreams. I was able to become fully awake and alert in the dream state, and that was liberating in and of itself. I had never been able to do that before, and, until it happened, I didn't believe it was really possible. By the way, it's a lot of fun, but nobody will believe you if you tell them about it the next day (as I'm sure most of you reading this probably won't). It is possible, but you also have to psych yourself up for it somewhat mentally and believe. Sad to say, but I'm still in the cradle compared with those who are buzzing around their neighborhoods. Fun, easy book.	2004-07-19
US	43633180	R1M5OINTGOVYS3	067101756X	466018903	The Day After Roswell	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Interesting read whether it's fiction or non-fiction.	I found this book highly interesting about the controversial Roswell UFO mystery. Add to that the fact that it's written by Lt.Col. (retired) Philip Corso, a military officer with a stellar reputation, for whom this book serves as what seems like a testimonial. He certainly didn't do it out of personal greed for money, he was in his 80s when he decided to write this book. It looks like he's someone who wanted to speak out before he died of old age about something his government, which he served honorably, was keeping from and lying to the public about. Even if you don't believe this story is true, the thoughts presented in this book by Lt.Col. Corso ranks as a highly entertaining science fiction read with the ideas (facts?) in it. It goes into not only the Roswell cover-up, but also how the US military went about dispersing alien hardware to US firms (most of it by Lt.Col. Corso himself), and how alien technology has been and continues to touch our lives today. That part of the book was really weird to think about. Personally, it was a page turner for me, and I finished it within a week.	2004-07-05

However, my wife was having a little trouble with irregular heartbeats, and I thought it'd be interesting to try an experiment combining the meditation tape, crystal and the orange meditation circle enclosed within the kit. She tried it, and said that she felt remarkably better. I'm sure other people out there have had unique experiences with it as well, and you have nothing to lose by trying the mindpower techniques Uri discusses.

Having expected this book to be more about the get rich schemes or preparing for the collapse of the world economy, I found this book to be more like a world history lesson on gold instead. The book provides an interesting look at gold from a historical perspective, and how it has dominated civilizations around the world in both the past and present. Gold has, as few would doubt, stood the test of time akin to a financial Rock of Gibraltar, and this book presents why that has been so and why it will continue to be so.	2004-03-26

Sears presents the events leading up to, during and after Gettysburg on both sides of the conflict. Sears crytallizes what went right and what went wrong before, during and after the battle as well, especially where the Confederacy is concerned. He substantiates these conflicting age old questions with statistics and views of the soldiers and officers involved in the moment to moment decision making, and lets the reader draw their own conclusions without Sears imposing his own view. The book was quite objective in dealing with the what-if scenarios in one sense, and is fascinating story telling concerning the battlefield in another sense. A hard book to put down once you start reading it.	2004-02-08

This book takes the reader back to a time before there was a secret service and presidents could take a buggy ride alone safely. It reminds the reader about the intensity of hatred towards Lincoln, and the extreme and desperate step one John Wilkes Booth, with the help of others (knowingly and unknowingly), took to try and re-alter the course of events at the tail end of the Civil War when events still hadn't come to a complete close (Lee had surrendered, but not Joseph E. Johnston in NC or Kirby Smith in the MS area). We see that Booth's intention was not to just destroy one idea by murdering Lincoln, but to also create a new movement for an independent South.	2004-01-10

Having just finished this book, I'd like to say that the book was refreshing to read on a deep, personal level. Most readers probably come away from this book with their own interpretations in a unique way, and why not if each of our lives are made up of a series of probable and multi-demensional realities. A few exercises are described in the book (by Seth) to help get in touch with our deeper selves, and they are certainly worth trying, easy to do and highly enlightening. I tried one of the exercises before falling asleep, and had a very lucid dream. I can't say that I understood everything I'd read perfectly, but I kept an open mind and tried to just let it soak in. It's certainly one of those books which you'd probably like to read again later. I'd read The Seth Material before this one, and I think that book helped set the table for Seth Speaks rather well.	2003-12-30

I bought this book years ago when it first came out in the 80s off the bargain shelf of Walden's.  I was just expecting the same old ghost stories as from other books which I had read, but this one is different and made the most lasting impression on me.  For one thing, it's not really a ghost book at all like I had anticipated at the time I bought it, but a book about sly, evil and invisible UNearthly beings which wish us simple earthly beings harm.  Ghosts are at least from our own earthly existence going about their own business (usually), but devils & demons (fallen angels) are vastly different?  I had never had an education of such spiritual matters before, and none since.  It was an eye-opening, educational read, and I started reading it the day I picked it up and finished it the next day.  The Warrens must have incredible inner strength spiritually to do what they do, and I could never see myself doing this for one a minute (or less).	2003-02-02
