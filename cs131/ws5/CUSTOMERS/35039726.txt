Honestly, I don't like \\"Crystal\\". <br />There are a couple of lines that could really confuse kids. <br />Plus, the people in it and the situations are so off-putting. <br />I don't know what it is with 'Virginia Andrews' characters all being wacko, especially sexually. <br />And both Crystal and her best friend having always longed to \\"play Doctor\\"..???????  This book is just Sick!!! <br /> <br />Most of it was just nauseating <br /> <br />  I found myself disliking all the characters and not caring what happened to them. <br /> <br />And the sudden phone call informing Crystal of her foster parents' death , at the end, seemed so out-of-the-blue that it was almost like.. a cop-out. (Similisr to Mr. Harvey's sudden death by falling icicle in The Lovely Bones) <br /> <br />Overall!!!!.. This book just really left me with a gross taste in my mouth. <br />(Please.

Disguising itself as a Blockbuster novel, this book is nothing more than a porn-novel.I swear it is.I'm not being prudish.I can indeed be prudish but here I speak in all honesty.If you are looking for an \\"adult\\"  novel that drivels on with no meaningful content and plenty of dirty scenes wherin the author lives out her filthiest fantasies on paper, then this is the book for you.  DOn't be fooled by the many many pages, into thinking that all that writing means GOOD writing.    If you are a Marilyn fan, skip this.JCO has simply used the fame of MArilyn's name to write a [...] book that will sell by the truckload.    Does Joyce have talent and some clever literacy?Maybe. Maybe the people who claim the book is clever are right to some small extent.  But, basically, this is just pages nad pages of what I have already mentioned.    The glimpses inside this book  of Marilyn's life and insecurities are surely obligatory pieces that lead to what Oates was really dying to write.What I have aforementioned.Along with a whole lot of fiction.    Again, Oates longed to write an, ahem, \\"adult\\" novel and used Marilyn Monroe as the central character.    If it's really Marilyn you want to read about, I suggest My Sister Marilyn.Her sister respected her.Even writers who didn't know her had some kind of respect for her and for literature.And for themselves.And for theri readers.Not this author.        Rest in peace, Marilyn, if you can.                       Linda M Rowe	2004-04-21

You'll read this book quickly and you might even be sad that you've finished it.Firstly,I will mention the only flaw in the story.....I think the author is a middle age man(thats not the flaw)who makes his characters speak like young boys did back in the 40's..yet there is mention of modern things like Playstations and computers in classrooms.SO I was confused about WHEN this book was meant to be taking place.However such a flaw does not really matter in such a page-turner.Oh,for goodness sake,Linda,tell us what it's about?!!You are saying???  Alright,alright already.

Jean Ritchie has written this book so well and it really draws you in.It is the true,detailed events of a seemingly ordinary family who are plagued by paranormal events that they strongly believe to be contact with aliens,mostly centred around their teenage son,Jason,who they are convinced is abducted by the ugly little creatures,most nights.Is he?I found it hard to be entirely convinced but there is definitely something strange happening to these people.And Jean wrote a long well-detailed book that very soon makes you feel as if you know this family.They truly hate what is happening to them,but they believe the odd experiences are helping them to grow spiritually.The often distressed family wish they could be like everyone else but they also insist that the aliens have the Earth's greater good in mind.If you like to read about paranormal experiences,then for goodness sake,BUY THIS BOOK!I could hardly get my head out of it.	2003-02-02
