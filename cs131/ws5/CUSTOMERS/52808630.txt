I love Neil Young and was looking forward to finding out more about him. But I just could not wade through this. Page after page was boring, not because of Neil's life, but because of the writing style. Blah blah blah. An amazing dude like Neil Young deserves a better biographer. I was sorely disappointed. Every other bio I've ever read was better than this - which I guess makes this the worst one I've ever read! <br />	2005-09-04

Books	4	65	116	N	Y	I bought this book simply because....	it makes me feel a little better that there are SOME people who don't take Christianity and it's literal belief in a fantasy book so seriously. It scares me to live in a world where a huge number of people actually believe the myth of the bible. Makes me feel I'm living in an insane asylum. Like our President who, because of the bible, thinks the end of the world is coming so we might as well help it along. Let's just nuke the middle east because that's what god wants.  Thanks George!    And before you accuse me of being uniformed and intolerant of religious belief, I have studied religious and spiritual traditions my whole life, and practiced them as well. And I'm not intolerant of personal belief - believe what you want but keep it to yourself. It's when religion is used to control others and force it down our throats that I can't tolerate. Look around you -- this is what those in power use Christianity for. The \\"crusades\\" are NOT over. We still give food to starving people only if they convert. We still make laws based on Christianity. How is that tolerant of other people's beliefs?    The reason this book gets a lot of bad reviews is because we live in an ignorant, facist, right wing, christian, intolerant, imperialistic, selfish, Bush voting country.	2004-10-29

We'll see in 5-10 years what happens. <br /> <br />I think Dent has some good ideas so it's not a total bomb of a book, but too often it seems to me he is stretching and convuluting statistics to fit his model instead of remaining objectively scientific. And some of what he says is just down right misleading, even if technically accurate. <br /> <br />On page 200 he is trying to show that a ten year time span is not enough to over come a large bust in the market. He says that if you had purchased stocks in 1929 you would have had to wait 24 years to break even. But the fact of the matter is people don't buy stocks like that. Hardly anyone would have just bought at ONE point in time, at the PEAK of the market in 1929. People buy a little here, a little there. For instance, if someone started buying in 1929 and put a little bit in per month (dollar cost averaging) they would be buying stock at low prices as well as high prices. Done this way, it would have taken 5 years instead of 24 to break even. <br /> <br />So Dent uses the fact that supports his point instead of being objective.  <br /> <br />One more example is the chart on page 175. He changed the notion of small stock out performance during the time frame 1975 - 1983 to 1958 - 1983 just to support his theory. Using that time frame matches what he's trying to show. One can use a variety of different time frames in this example but he choose one because it supports his theory, not because it's objective. <br /> <br />So, I think the book is worth reading and getting a few tidbits out of, but to follow it blindly - whoa is you! I just wish he was more scientifically objective. It is WAY to easy to twist statistics to support a theory. Try it yourself -- see how easy it is! <br />	2004-10-05

Throughout there is a subtle sense of pride. A flavor that he thinks he is *cool* and better than others. This is very subtle but I can taste it. <br />  <br /> 2. But where he really lost me was what he says on page 45. Does he really believe that crap? He could cross the street without looking as a kid because *God* was protecting him. Uniquely him, not others, because obviously others get hit by cars, in accidents, death by war and drive by shootings. There are accidents, injury, death every day, but *God* wouldn't let anything happen to him! And as an adult *God* has also saved him. So, if you practice spiritual life according to his *God*, you won't get hurt, but *God* doesn't give a damn about people who don't practice, so they are the ones who get in all the accidents every minute of every day? So Mr. Teasdale, are you going to die from old age some day?  <br /> <br />Reminds me of the sports figures who think *God* is specifically on their side. Yeah, *God* cares about the Giants but not the Dodgers. *He* has nothing better to do than watch you swing a bat! <br /> <br />I should have known after seeing that the forward was written by that pompous a** Ken Wilber.  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-29

Like a stoner wrote it while stoned. Maybe that's the case. It was frustrating because it simply wasn't clear what he was saying.

Almost everything I wanted to look up, and knew was in the book, was not in the index.<BR>Oh, one more thing: he didn't mention that adding Keith and Donna was the BIGGEST mistake the Dead ever made (besides Garcia's heroin abuse)!

That is why we, as a planet, are in danger. The utter stupidity that people get away with these days! Anyone who buys into these so-called statistics is simply blind and in their head too much. Open your eyes and look around. Pollution and over population, and the scarcity of resources isn't an abstract statistical thing if you open your eyes. Walk outside in any city - it's harder to breath than it was when I was a kid, a mere couple of decades ago, for one example. The fact that every damn idiotic couple has way too many kids, a lot more than just replacing their own two selves, makes it an obvious fact that the world will run out of space and resources for us. Having 6 kids is down right irresponsible and stupid.<br />But the world will take care of this problem for us if we don't become intelligent about it. When the pressures become too great, the planet will simply create a \\"black plague\\" or some such thing to bring our population down.<br />Anyway, these are just a few thoughts.

Why should those of us who believe that religion is merely a crutch for those who fear death, and is pure fiction made up in the minds of those who are too afraid to accept and feel the reality that they are merely the body and will die some day for good (no after life - sorry!), have to live under the rule of religious belief?<br />Politics and religion should have no over lap at all.

All of the exercises with pictures should be in one section, grouped by body part, like most excercise books.

Anyway, after reading this book I don't know any more about my dog than I did before. <br />BUT MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK WAS THIS: he talks about the horror of all the millions of dogs that are killed every year due to over population and then encourages buying your dog from a breeder! Pet stores and breeders are part of the problem. If you absolutely need a particular pure breed you can try to get one from a rescue organization and failing that get one from a breeder. But MOST people just want a family dog and a dog from the animal shelter are just as good or better than one from a breeder.
