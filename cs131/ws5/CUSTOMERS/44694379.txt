Augusten Burroughs lays his life bare for the world to see.  It's funny at times, incredibly sad, but real--completely honest. <br /> <br />To understand the context one must first read \\"Running with Scissors.\\"  In it, Burroughs lays bare his childhood and one gains an understanding of how he could find himself living the life he shares in \\"Dry.\\" <br /> <br />I picked this book up only because I had read his previous book--I had no idea of the subject matter.  That being said, it opened my eyes.  The reality of an addict's life is shocking to those who have never experienced it, but necessary for anyone who has someone in their life that is struggling. <br /> <br />Burroughs is to be commended for his honesty.  His work is brilliant.	2004-11-29

Augusten Burroughs' memoir is one of the most amazing books I have ever read.  His description of his childhood left me laughing at times while utterly in shock at other times. <br /> <br />Anyone surviving this type of upbringing and having the mental wherewithwal to pick up a pen has to be an incredibly strong person.  The abuse, the bizzare events on a daily basis, the instability would have destroyed most children, but somehow Augusten survived.  Not only did he survive, but he developed a great sense of humor that often leaves the reader laughing at some of the most bizzare of circumstances. <br /> <br />This is a great read.  You will not be able to put it down.	2004-11-24

This book just absolutely blew me away!<br />It's a long book, some 600 pages, but it truly is one that the reader can hardly bear to put down.<br />Katharine Graham is widely recognized for her association with Watergate, but this book goes oh so much further in truly revealing what an incredible woman she truly was.  In truth, it reveals a person of such incredible humility and impeccable character.<br />Perhaps what amazed me the most about the book (I, like most, expected the frequent references to &quot;who's who&quot; in American history--she just happenned to rub shoulders with all of them) was her glaring honesty in talking about herself in retrospect--her self esteem, her marriage, her abilities as a manger, and her track record as a mother.<br />Katharine Graham was courageous enough, and indeed showed her brilliance, in truly opening up about what she faced growing up in a sheltered, priveleged upbringing.  She was honest about her mother, her relationship with her father, and her insecurity in dealing with men in her early years.<br />The Watergate sequence of the book can't be glossed over--she saved American journalism--but the reader is so drawn into the development of her as a confident, commanding individual and her growth as a manager, that Watergate does not consume the book.  In fact, she devotes perhaps equal time to the labor issues that bogged the business down in the 1970's.<br />Her humility is evident throughout the book.  The references to power and greatness are inevitable; after all, how many Americans can have claimed to have lunched at Albert Einstein's house, been close friends with Teddy Roosevelt's daughter, and have summered with Nancy Reagan?  Despite the references, she is impeccably honest in her assesment of people--a refreshing trait.<br />This is truly a remarkable read for anyone who truly wants to discover what makes a true leader.	2003-09-02

It took me a while to bring myself to read it.  After all, I never thought I was \\"that bad.\\"  After two evenings (yes, no excuses, it doesn't take long) of reading this book, I've realized I have a lot of work to do.<br />Palatnik and Burg both do an excellent job of tying in timely stories with timeless principles that, if followed, will lead the reader to a better life.<br />I'm not Jewish, but I thoroughly enjoyed the numerous references to Jewish faith and the quotes from Old Testament scripture--timeless, indeed.<br />If for nothing else, the book has the most incredible collection of quotes I have seen.<br />I won't name names, but let's face it, we all could stand to read and abide by this little book.	2003-07-15

Rick Warren has a writing style that really draws the reader in.  It's simplistic, yet incredibly powerful and particularly enlightening.<br />I think a lot of people are somewhat confused with the purpose of this book.  Sure, I guess it could be considered a &quot;motivational&quot; type book, but it's true purpose is to draw the reader into a deeper understanding of what a walk with Christ is truly supposed to include.<br />Warren touches on great points dealing with a believer's relationship with a local church, in addition to a relationship with God.  In fact, he goes as far as to say that you can't truly have a relationship with Christ without fellowship with fellow believers.<br />Some of the complaints with this book seem to focus on the fact that Warren approaches this &quot;purpose&quot; through the eyes of a Southern Baptist minister.  In my opinion, however, that does not limit this book to readers of only that particular demonination.  I believe that quite the opposite is true--I think the various translations used give a well-rounded approach to a deep walk with Christ.  Conformity isn't preached, but devotion is certainly espoused.<br />This provides an excellent Lent study or could serve throughout the year--I certainly recommend it.	2003-07-14

That being said, there's probably only one person on the face of the earth who ever got to know his heart and that person will never \\"kiss and tell\\"--Nancy Reagan.<br />Morris could have done better.	2003-07-12

Harding in His Times	Books	4	3	8	N	N	The Oft-maligned President	With few exceptions, Warren G Harding is always referred to as America's \\"worst president\\" and this book goes to great depths to find out just exactly why.<br />It's no secret now that Warren G. Harding was the William Jefferson Clinton of his day when it came to an eye for the opposite sex.  The difference between the two in this regard (which in no way compares their presidencies) is that in Harding's day, no one talked about it, and if they did, absolutely no one wrote about it.<br />Harding was one of the most notorious (and last) of America's \\"selected\\" Presidents, where party bosses met in \\"smokey back rooms\\" and arrived at reasonable compromises.  In fact, the author is sympathetic to the reasoning that Harding never had any aspirations on being President and probably could have cared less if he had lost.  (It's hard to say he showed any passion in campaigning for the job)<br />Harding was faced with many obstacles besides an inability to keep his zipper up.  He doesn't seem to have made the wisest choice in his choosing of a mate, in fact, according to the author, she appears to be the one who had true aspirations for the presidency.<br />Harding was dogged throughout the campaign by rumors that he was of African-American descent, something that his relatives still seem intent on fighting to this day.  What does appear to be true is the fact that the family were devout abolitionists and served on the Underground Railroad.<br />Harding's most prominent flaw seems to be his affability, something that many had assumed at the time to be his dominant strength.  His inability to call his friends to task, allowed them to run free with the power of the Federal government.<br />His death will be controversial for years to come, and the author does little to truly answer the question of murder vs. food poisioning, but his presidency remains notorious.  If simply for the fact that is considered \\"the worst.\\"	2003-07-11

It was my first introduction to politics and I've been fascinated ever since.<br />Ronald Reagan has been called many things, but this work truly shows his skill as the &quot;Great Communicator.&quot;  The autobiography is unique in the fact that it draws heavily from his diaries, instead of his re-enacted versions of past events, giving the reader a true glimpse into his true character.<br />Ronad Reagan had the classic American story.  Small town boy makes big, goes to Hollywood.  That's usually where the story ends, but in his case, he took it all the way to the White House.<br />It is interesting to realize how much his view of the dangers of the Soviet Union shaped his views of the world.  Many have been critical of the fact that he focused so much of his time on the USSR, to the neglect of the Middle East and China, but at the same time, we do have to admit that his attention paid off in ways no one could have imagined at the time.<br />What you won't find in here is what we have come to expect from most political figures.  This is no &quot;tell all!&quot;  Ronald Reagan was probably the last of the &quot;old world politicians&quot; in the sense that he was more issues focused, as opposed to dealing with opponents or supporters on a personal level.  In other words, he doesn't dish the dirt on what he felt about those in his Administration or even in the opposition.  He thought to highly of the office of the presidency to allow it to sink to the &quot;personal attack&quot; level.<br />Whatever your political viewpoints are, the eight years of Ronald Reagan were a defining moment of the past century in the sense that years after his presidency, he is still as deeply loved, or hotly debated, as any president in modern history.  That alone is no small achievement.	2003-07-11

Not for his accomplishments, as he had always envisioned, but for his failures.<br />In \\"RN\\", written, in my opinion, too closely after his resignation, Nixon seeks to tell his side of the Watergate story, as well as give the reader a glimpse into his meteoric rise and abrupt halt as GOP \\"star.\\"<br />Using his now infamous notes, Nixon shares with the reader his side of the Alger Hiss trial that propelled him to instant stardom within the House and into the US Senate.  President Eisenhower suprised many with his unlikely choice of Nixon as Vice Presidential candidate, a position that placed him in a delicate position in light of his position in the Hiss trial.  The Eisenhower administration was now in the position of finding a way to get rid of Joe McCarthy or face the wrath of an exasperated American population.<br />His campaign against John F. Kennedy was the closest in history (until 2000) that many think embittered him for life.  A loss in the California Governor's race seemed to further embitter him, but he came back with a splash.<br />He attempts to minimize his involvement in Watergate, saying he was \\"misled\\" and \\"lied too.\\"  However, most historians are somewhat skeptical of those claims.<br />The work should be read, if only for the fact that everyone is entilted to tell their side of the story.	2003-07-11

It's not a thriller that you pick up and just can't put down, but in its own way, it is uniquely interesting.<br />George H. W. Bush was a prolific letter writer, something that is truly becoming a lost art.  It is said that he had the most active rolodex of any man to hold the office of President.  <br />Never known for his skillful speaking ability, Bush preferred to communicate through letters and this work will certainly give historians a unique insight into a fascinating life.<br />They always say, &quot;like father, like son&quot; and George H. W. Bush's two sons who are active in politics seem to have inherited similar traits.  Jeb Bush, the Florida governor, is said to respond to over 100 e-mails personally each day, and George W. Bush, the President, was said to be an e-mail addict.  (That is, until he became President and e-mails become subject to subpeonas).<br />Don't run out and buy this, but if you ever have a down day in the library, pick it up and read a few of the letters.  It will probably show you a side of the man that you never knew existed.	2003-07-11

In the case of Queen Elizabeth I, the Elizabethian Age was followed several hundred years later by the Victorian Age of Queen Victoria, only to give way in time to Margaret Thatcher and &quot;Thatcherism.&quot;<br />Margaret Thatcher was truly a unique politician--not simply for the fact that she became the first female to head a western democracy, but because she was truly skilled and resolved in the art of politics.<br />Margaret Thatcher was born into politics.  The child of an alderman, she served under Harold Macmillan and in the government of Edward Heath.<br />Her view of government and her rise to power mirrored, in many ways, the acension of Ronald Reagan in the United States.  And, indeed, theirs is considered on the of the closest political alliances in history.  Her view of smaller government, whatever the readers point of view, clicked with what England needed after years of shifting towards a socialist system.  She was keen on privatization and lowering taxes.  Something, that although cases could be made either way, certainly worked for her in 1980's Great Britian.<br />The book also points out her outspoken opposition to communism, thus earning her the title &quot;iron lady.&quot;  Young takes care to highlight her brilliance as a visionary, her willingness to restore British pride by refusing to give up the Falkands, and her resolve in not giving one inch of ground in her belief that the democratic, free enterprise system was superior.<br />This is truly a great book for all who are interested in the end of the Cold War and for those who wish to study the conservative &quot;revolution&quot; that struck the West in the 1980's.	2003-07-11

After all, most (if not all) of her television and radio appearances show her in a giddy state, just dripping of controversial tidbits that are rarely backed up with facts.<br />There are intersting points in the book.  McCarthy, despite the contempt with which he is now viewed, did have a tremendous impact on America's view of communism in the 1950's and one has to wonder if the fall of the Soviet Empire who have come quite as quickly if he hadn't been so intent on weeding out their loyal followers in the US.  That being said, McCarthy's tactics, despite Coulter's arguments to the contrary, were unexcusable.  History has shown that he wasn't always wrong, but his accuracy rate certainly leaves a lot to be desired.  The problem with those type of statistics are the undisputable facts that he left many lives in ruin.<br />In the end, he suffered a similar end.<br />Certainly Ann Coulter, for all of her brilliance, could find a more worthy hero for the conservative agenda.	2003-07-11

I'll confess that I wasn't the biggest fan of &quot;Dutch,&quot; and was somewhat hesitant to read this, but he stepped up to the plate and delivered a masterpiece.<br />Theodore Roosevelt was truly a man years ahead of his time in many aspects.  His view on conservation issues, his racial views, and his desire to assert the United States as a player in world affairs were truly fitting for a president at the turn of the last century.<br />Roosevelt balanced so many delicate issues while in office.  Worker's rights were just beginning to really take center stage and he found himself thrust in the midst of labor vs. management disputes--an issue that had the potential of wrecking his winning the Republican nomination.  As always, he worked his magic, asserting himself and arriving at a mutual agreement.<br />With the Civil War still looming fresh in many minds, and the South still embittered over Reconstruction, Roosevelt also found himself forced to deal with racial issues.  His approach, though somewhat suffering from the bigoted mindset that seemed the norm in that day, was to appoint the best people to fill government positions--whether they be white or black.  If he worked to hard to appease white Democrats, he risked upsetting black Republicans who once again had the potential of costing him the Republican nomination.<br />The way he dealt with the Germans and British over Venezuela certainly established the supremecy of the Monroe Doctrine.  He also managed to avoid a war with Germany, something that we all know would eventually be unavoidable.<br />He faced many of the same issues faced by the Bush Administration today.  Race and charges of imperialism.  Cuba, the Phillipines, and Puerto Rico could easily subsitute for Afghanistan, Liberia, and Iraq.<br />That being said, it's certainly relevant to today's world and a fascinating read on an amazing man.	2003-07-09

JCCI (Jacksonville Community Council Inc), a community affairs group in Jacksonville, FL, had done a study on neighborhood tipping points inspired by this book.<br />I was particularly enthralled by Gladwell's presentation of mavens, salesmen, and connectors.  They possess the ability to truly send an idea over the particular point that would make it a full-blown trend.  He used the example of the rebirth of Hush Puppies.  Hush Puppies were a dying brand and on the verge of extinction when they suddenly became the consumate fashion accessory.<br />He also delves into the story of Paul Revere and his role as a &quot;connector&quot; in providing the spark that truly tipped the scale towards a full blown revolution.<br />The in-depth discussion of teenage smoking is particularly relavant and one wishes that it was required reading for the Surgeon General before millions are spent on ads.<br />Of course, as a child of the 70's and 80's, I also thought the study of Sesame Street as a trendsetter was pretty interesting.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how things become trends or to someone who has a desire to spark a change.  It's truly enlightening.	2003-07-09

After all, he followed one of the most enduring of all leaders--FDR--and was followed by one of the greatest Generals of American history--Dwight Eisenhower.  However, in this book, McCullough shows the incredible role that Truman did play in shaping modern American history.<br />Truman was a pioneer in the civil rights movement, becoming one of the first Democrats to begin to turn that into a major issue for the party.  He was a plain-spoken man, who held no punches--after all, he was the president who decided to drop the atomic bomb.<br />For all of his complexities, Truman really stands out in this work as someone who really stood up for what he believed in--at all cost.  This work serves to elevate Harry Truman to a level that he deserves in American History.<br />It's a wonderful read and incredibly intruiging.  You won't want to put it down.	2003-06-24

I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.<br />The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.<br />Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way.  An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life.  The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.<br />Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.<br />It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form.  Don't distort the beauty of the old English language with a modern translation.	2003-06-24

He caught my interest years ago when he first ran for Mayor of New York City.  Fellow moderate Republicans are often hard to find, especially ones who rise to such prominence as Rudy Giuliani.<br />In the great tradition of many leaders (King David, the prophet Samuel, John F. Kennedy, etc), Rudy's personal life does not always quite match up to the stellar expectations that so many of us seem to place on our public figures.  However, no one can ever accuse Rudy Giuliani of shirking a duty to lead.  And, in this book, he describes just exactly how he does that.<br />The book is actually broken down into such a great format that it could really serve as fodder for future Leadership classes.  He breaks it down into:<br />--Everyone's Accountable, All The Time.<BR>--Underpromise and Overdeliver.<BR>--Develop and Communicate Strong Beliefs.<BR>--Organize Around a Purpose.<BR>--Reflect, Then Decide.<br />The point that reasonated with me from the minute I first read it, was in his first declaration that &quot;I'm Responsible.&quot;  Those two little words clearly set the tone for how Rudy views Leadership.  He goes into detail about building a great team, properly communicating a mission, and revisiting results; but in the end, it all comes down to the fact that he views himself, as a Leader, to be the one responsible.<br />I actually put off reading this book for several months because I just was not ready to revisit September 11.  (I assumed that the bulk of the book would revolve around that theme.)  In the end, I became a little annoyed with myself that I had put such a great read off for so long.<br />This truly is one of the best (and simplest) breakdowns of true leadership.  I would recommed it for anyone looking to sharpen their skills.	2003-04-28

In many ways, this is the side of Afghanistan that most Americans never saw.  In fact, as Latifah so aptly points out, prior to September 11, many Afghani's felt as if the rest of the world had turned a blind eye to their plight.<br />Latifah tells the story of life under Soviet occupation, which despite its promotion of a Marxist society, seems to have afforded Afghans with a relatively stable environment.  <br />She follows the Soviet withdrawal and the civil wars that ensued, including a sobering account of the Taliban takeover.  Life under the Taliban was as hard as we ever heard in Western news accounts, perhaps even harsher.  Latifah tells of the incredible fear to even leave the apartment...the knowledge that a woman visible on the street was certain to face beating, perhaps death.<br />In the end, her family makes a remarkable escape--something that was only supposed to be for a brief period, but which became permament exile.<br />This is a must read for anyone interested in life under the Taliban.	2003-01-24

About the same time that strange bumps begin appearing on her face, Kathy (her longtime friend and roomate) begins to lose her mind.<br />On a totally different scale, Ellen Kroft finds herself the dissenting voice on a panel of experts about to unleash the First Lady's prized vaccine on the US population.  <br />All three characters are on a collision course, that much is sure.  What Palmer is quite adept at is holding the reader at bay until the last possible moment.  Finally, it becomes apparent what they are all fixed on the same mission as the converge upon Belinda, West Virginia.<br />The ending is somewhat of a dissapointment for those who love the classic good vs. evil endings where good ultimately triumphs.  To be sure, it does triumph, but not perhaps on the scale the average reader would desire.  However, Palmer is the expert at medical intrigue and its a great read (and medical education).	2003-01-18

I'm probably one of the very few Americans who still hasn't made up their mind of the O.J. Simpson matter.  But here, 10 years later, I stumble across O.J.'s book in the local library and decide to listen to his side of the story.<br />Unfortunately, since this book was written when it was (O.J. was in jail awaiting trial) he didn't have the freedom to truly speak his mind in regards to the details surrounding the death of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman.<br />What he was able to tell us; however, are some insights into what was going through his mind as he awaited trials.  Of course, he proclaimed his innocence, but the book is about so much more than that.  It allowed the reader to understand where O.J. was coming from.  His fatherless childhood, his desire to succeed.  His confusion as he found himself somewhat unaccepted by two different races for two totally different reasons.<br />Perhaps the saddest part of the book were the various letters that referenced racial issues.  Apparently, many Americans can't see past black and white...that's the sad part of the book.	2003-01-18

US	44694379	R1NMWSI87OWQUC	0440225701	454775948	The Street Lawyer	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A Compelling Departure	As evidenced by the reviews you will find on Amazon[.com], this is a departure for John Grisham.  However, I think it is an intersting one--maybe not the classics he has written before, but a compelling tale nonetheless.<br />His depictions of DC are incredible.  You feel as if you are walking the streets as he describes them throughout the book, leaving no blighted neighborhood behind.<br />As is typical with Grisham's works, the story focuses aroung a young, idealistic attorney.  This one leaves fame and fortune behind to fight for the homeless.  His wife, not sensing the same generous spirit, determines that he no longer matches her needs, and leaves him in the lurch.<br />I guess most of the complaints with this work are that it is too contrived, perhaps written directly for the screen, instead of exclusively for literary content.  Some of that may be the case, but I think that Grisham does an overall good job of potraying the classic \\"give everything up to help the poor\\" that society could perhaps use a little more of.	2002-12-27

His legal expertise is obvious in any of his writings and it really comes through in this particular tale.<br />Darby Shaw is the classic \\"all-American girl next door.\\"  (Fittingly depicted by Julia Roberts in the ensuing movie)  Working on a legal brief at Tulane, Shaw stumbles upon \\"the brief.\\"  <br />\\"The Brief\\" is the classic tale of power and corruption, placed, interestingly enough, in New Orleans.  After her realization that possession of the brief, or the knowledge of the contents, is a stamp to certain death, Shaw looks to escape and get her story out.<br />Her professor is killed in a tragic car bomb just minutes after Shaw left his side, and she knows she has to flee.<br />At the same time, Gray Grantham (aptly portrayed by Denzel Washington) is a DC reporter who has been alerted to \\"the brief\\" by a mysterious Garcia.<br />Eventually, Grantham and Shaw hook up, discover who Garcia was and how he was killed, and eventually uncover the mysteries of \\"the brief\\"--a web that streches to the very top of the Washington power structure.<br />In the end, good always wins, and Grisham does a great job of pulling us through this one with style, suspense, and wholesome reading.	2002-12-27
US	44694379	RESGUCQAUE26N	044021145X	438349301	The Firm	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Classic Grisham	John Grisham has hit a home run with the firm.  It's a tale that leaves you hanging breathless on the edge of your seat as you race towards the finish, hopeing, trusting, that the good guys will get away and the bad guys will go down to certain defeat.<br />Mich McDeere (portrayed by Tom Cruise in the movie) is a young lawyer who just made it big time.  He is hired by Bendini, Lambert, and Locke--a powerful, wealthy firm in Memphis, TN.  His wife and he feel like they are finally making it--trading in their cramped apartment for new, spacious digs and ditching the old car for a new luxury sedan.<br />It isn't long before McDeere begins to become wary of the extreme security in plaace at the firm.  He is soon approached by an FBI agent who informs him that everything in his home and office is bugged.<br />In forthcoming meetings, the FBI informs McDeere that they are investigating the firm and they need his help.  Realizing he has no option, McDeere goes along.  The personal torture of putting his wife through the strain and his forthcoming marital problems add a personal element to the story like only Grisham can do.<br />In the end, all is saved.  The partners are jailed and McDeere is re-united with his wife.  A great story.	2002-12-27

(And the movie ranks up in my all-time favorites as well)  <br />The tale is set in the deep south, where racial divides are glossed over, but are quickly brought to the surface when Carl Lee steps onto the scene.<br />Carl Lee (powerfully portrayed by Samuel L Jackson in the movie) realizes that his daughter is not going to receive justice at the hands of an all-white jury.  (Carl Lee and his daughter are African-Americans and the little girl was raped and tortured by two white men.)  When Carl Lee decides to take the law into his own hands and kills the two men enroute to their trial, all hell breaks loose.<br />Jake Brigance, a young, idealistic, white attorney is persuaded to defend Carl Lee and the courtroom drama begins.  Jake's former professor, disgraced and disbarred though he be, adds the legal expertise that is needed to an attorney still wet behind the ears.<br />The drama outside the courtroom is no less spectacular as the KKK and NAACP descend on the town.  To many, Carl Lee is a hero, but to the KKK, he is vigalante gone wild.<br />As is always true with John Grisham's works, in the end right and justice prevail, and Carl Lee is set free.<br />A great story and my favorite of Grisham's works.	2002-12-27

He has that unique ability to paint a picture such that one can actually picture themselves in the trailer with LuAnn, holding our breaths as we wish her the best in making her escape.<br />I had a hard time putting this book down.  In fact, I finished it in two days.<br />After winning her millions and making a successful break, we are re-introduced to LuAnn a decade later.  The two LuAnn's are not even comprable--a testimony to what millions and proper tutoring can do!<br />For anyone who enjoys suspensful fiction, this is a great read.	2002-12-24
US	44694379	R1K33ZGDNDVRM	0440174643	633917650	Roots (Dell Book)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Fascinating	Alex Haley is truly a genius!  I missed the TV mini-series and picked this book up on a whim one day and couldn't set it down until I had finished.<br />First of all, anyone who has ever attempted to trace their family tree knows just what a daunting task that can be.  However, for a descendant of slaves, it is next to impossible.  Perhaps that's what makes the story such a masterpiece.  <br />The harsh reality of slavery is never more evident than when we are living through the abduction of Kunte Kinte from his village.  As he makes his voyage across the sea to an unkown land, we are held together only by the fact that we know he has to live, if only because this book is about him.<br />The Murray family's story is one that is truly telling of many of the slave owners at that time.  Their attempts to balance their religious beliefs with their ownership of other human beings was something that apparently many at that time dealt with.  Despite their kindness; however, one had to wonder if they dealt with that struggle by still not truly seeing their slaves as true humans.<br />Like many, I think the character \\"Tom\\" represents the American spirit.  His ability to realize that he was beholden to no man, white or black, and his courage in taking a stand depicts the beliefs that eventually led to the Civil Rights movement.<br />\\"Roots\\" should be a must-read in any class on American history.  I don't think I have ever read a book that was so honest in its depiction of America's great sin.	2002-12-24

The movie was therefore, a slight disappointment for me as I think they really failed to truly capture the suspense the Harris is so adept at weaving.<br />Hannibal Lecture is truly one of the most fascinating characters that has ever been created.  (In my humble opinion, of course)  Harris truly sensed what he could do with this work as he created just enough trickery at the end to ensure a sequel.<br />Dr. Lecture has that unique ability to get into someone's mind, but he met his match in Clarice Starling.  In the end, they both sacrificed little portions of their personal histories to get something out of each other.  For Clarice, the information she obtained ensured her acclamation as a modern heroine.  For Dr. Lecture, the chance to renew his participation in &quot;real world&quot; revived his spirit and utlimately led to his escape.<br />Serial killers happen to be a particular fascination of mine and no one quite matches the lore of Hannibal Lecture.<br />This is a must read!	2002-12-24

This sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was a terrific read; that is, up until the last two chapters of the book.<br />Poor Clarice.  Her life after successfully bringing down the serial killer Gumm certainly wasn't as she had imagined.  It seems she found out that if one makes a formidable enemy on the way to the top, the top may prove to be ever elusive.<br />Dr. Lecture's masquerade in Florence was fascinating.  Harris really showed the extensive research that he did in writing this book.  In many ways, it was an education in medevial art and history as well as an exploration into the mind of a serial killer.<br />The murder of the magistrate was particularly fascinating.  This murder was more public than Dr. Lecture's previous murders.  (To be sure, being fed a gourmet meal that just happens to include a former member of your board is quite public, but this was different.)  The murder brings out Dr. Lecture's love of history and his flair for drama.<br />The in-depth exploration of Mason Virger was truly interesting.  Mason happens to have many of the same complexities of Hannibal Lecture, as is obvious when Harris constantly alludes to his escapades during the summer camps that his dad sponsored.  Mason's desire to bring down Dr. Lecture was more about the desire to see a human eaten alive, than about acheiving revenge.  In the end, what an gorey way to die!  Sharing your last breaths with the very eel that you bought because of its ability to consume life.<br />I just cannot accept the ending; however.  I was truly wrapped into this.  I expected Krendall to be eaten alive, a fate that was depicted in the movie.  However, I never expected Starling to succumb to the charms of the doctor.<br />To be honest, the ending really disturbed me.  But, isn't that what Harris probably wanted.  Just the idea that we could show up at the opera one night and bump into a charming couple that could perhaps be the good doctor and Agent Starling!<br />Despite the ending, Harris has really outdone himself once again.  His exploration of the \\"palace of the mind\\" was one of the most fasinating reads ever.	2002-12-24
US	44694379	RTGV14D50KJQA	0345379756	780069179	The Autobiography of Malcolm X (As told to Alex Haley)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	The Truth About Malcolm X	I actually read this book quite by accident.  I was headed out of the library aisle with my stack of audio books for the week when this book caught my eye.  Someone had knocked it out of place and it was jutting out, and so I picked it up.<br />I must confess that the Malcolm X that we studied about in American history (for that brief mention he receieved) was the Malcolm that was depicted in the middle of the book--the Malcolm who had just been released from prison.  The Malcolm that Malcolm X came to be at the end of his life was a story that I was quite unfamiliar with.<br />It's actually quite amazing that Malcolm X made anything out of his life.  He had such an incredibly tragic childhood and hearing this story actually afforded me a better understanding of the hatred that he developed toward the right race during the middle of his life.  Placed in his shoes, we all might have a somewhat different outlook of the world at large.  If anything, the fact that he became the well-known figure he did, speaks to a strength of character that is quite formidable.<br />Most of us are familiar with the Malcolm X of the Elijah Mohammed days.  This is the Malcolm that preached hatred and revolution, which as I have already mentioned, is quite understandable with a review of his life's circumstances to this point.<br />The Malcolm X that returned from Mecca is the Malcolm that I was never aware of.  One has to wonder what the fate of race relations might have been in the United States would be if Malcolm had lived to carry his dream forward.  Who knows, we could have escaped some of the violence of the 60's and 70's and be farther along on the road.<br />This is a must read for any student of American history, regardless of their ethnic background.  Malcolm's story must and should be told.	2002-12-24

Ms. Morrison rights in such a style that you actually hear the hooves of the approaching horses, see the frantic scrambling of the desperate slave, and picture the blood-soaked bodies of her children.<br />Probably the one thing that I regret about this book is the fact that I listened to it on tape, as opposed to actually reading it in print.  This caused a little confusion as I reached 3/4 of the way through the book and I tried to relate to characters and scenes that had been briefly described in earlier chapters who were now front and center.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book and I'll certainly seek out Ms. Morrison's other works for enjoyment.	2002-12-06

This is one that makes you want to keep driving...you just don't have the willpower to turn it off.<br />Jack Graham is somewhat reminiscent of a lot of John Grisham's heroes...young, wanting to do the right thing, and on the brink of something really big.  The effectiveness in which Baldacci brings the most powerful position in the world into this work leaves you breathless.  He really convinces you near the end that the world is falling into some degenerate state where the good guys can't win.  But, just at the last moment, when it seems all is lost, goodness triumphs.<br />This is a great read...I'd recommend it to anyone.	2002-12-06

A client had jokingly asked if I had ever read the &quot;Kane &amp; Abel&quot; story and I laughed, assuming he was using the standard Biblical reference that I had heard all of my life.  One day, I happened across the title and was hooked.<br />Jeffrey Archer is an incredible author who has the ability to weave a tale that pulls you in completely.  He writes the works that renders you sleepless...I found myself pulling myself back out of bed at night just to read through this one in one day.<br />If you haven't read Jeffrey Archer, this is a great start!	2002-12-06

I can't say I didn't like it, the simple portrayal of life did have a certain appeal to it.  However, this isn't one of those books that you pick up and find yourself unable to sleep, wanting to stay up and find out what was on the next page.  In fact, it took me about 4 days to work my way through this one--a record when it comes to my typical time with Grisham's books.	2002-01-06

He has true talent and spins a great tale.  <br />The reader does find themselves hit with so many characters at first, that it is quite difficult to keep up, but it's one of those books that you just can't put down.  I found myself staying up late just to finish it.  I had to see if he could make it off the ship, then faced the China debacle.<br />I guess my main reason for not giving it five stars was just for the &quot;believability&quot; of the text.

Being a native of North Florida, I enjoyed the setting, especially all of the references to Jacksonville Beach landmarks--it gave it a &quot;real&quot; feel.  However, the story line streched it perhaps a bit too far.  This is probably one that you would want to check out from your public library instead of buying yourself.	2002-01-06

Written in a child-like prose, the book gives the sense of one's favorite nursery rhyme, well instilling the valued quality of dealing with change.<br />Sciff and Scurry wasted no time in adjusting to change--quite unlike most of us today.  Hem and Haw more aptly fit the description of the average American worker--unable to see change coming, and unwilling to adjust when it does hit us head on.<br />Fortunately for Haw, he eventually came to the realization of his need to &quot;move with the cheese.&quot;  But not before living on the edge of starvation.  Hem never comes to the realization in the book, but one can only wish that the final footsteps heard were his--finally breaking free from the past.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone--young, old, working, non-working.  We all deal with change in both our professional and personal lifes and I haven't read anything that deals with it on such a basic level as this work from Spencer Johnson.	2001-07-01
