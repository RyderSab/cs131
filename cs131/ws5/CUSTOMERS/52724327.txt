If you like such works as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or Rowlings \\"Harry Potter\\" series I think you will enjoy this new fantasy novel.  In book one of the trilogy we meet Prince Aaron, the only son of King Dermot and Queen Audrey of Gower.  Prince Aaron lives a sheltered life, for his protection.  Prince Aaron and Byram, his cousin and best friend, set off on an adventure that will change their lives and the lives of those around them.  The adventure he seeks is in Woodbyrne forest.  Many have entered and no one has returned.<br />Quinn, a young woman in another town, was abducted by a demon soldier and brought to his leader, Isidore, as a servant. She is spirited and does not succumb to Isidore's demands.  Isidore is fed up with her insolence and is ready to end her life when Prince Aaron and Byram come along.  Three entered the cave but only 2 will leave.  They lived thanks to the help and friendship of the elves of the forest.<br />This story has great battle scenes and horrible demons.  Its good vs. evil.  Is it an adventure story?  Or is it horror?  Perhaps it is a bit of both with a little romance thrown in for good measure.  I thoroughly enjoyed escaping into their world and I looked forward to going back after I had been away.<br />D'Arienzo is a talented new voice to watch out for.  Courage, honor, friendship, truth, love and family. All the values a good fantasy book should have.	2003-06-10

Zeb, the boy next door, and Rumer were the same age and inseparable best friends.  At five, they decided that Rumer \\"ruled the earth\\" because of her love of animals and Zeb \\"ruled the sky\\" because he loved the stars.<br />As Rumer and Zeb grew up their feelings grew to more than that of friends.  It was awkward turning the friendship into something more but they were working on it.  Rumer went away to college to become a vet and Zeb was at another college striving to become an astronaut. The distance was rough on them as they had never spent that much time apart and Elizabeth didn't help.  Elizabeth had set her sites on Zeb and was pursuing her acting career as heartily as she was Zeb.  Later Elizabeth and Zeb were married and had a son, Michael.<br />Rumer's strength and determination are inspiring and her ability to forgive was hard to fathom.  Her personality was lovable and her determination was admirable.  Rumer never left Hubbard's Point and her love of family, animals, and the boy next door never waivered.<br />I would love to move to Hubbard's Point, go lobstering with Quinn, another of Rice's enchanting characters and have my pets taken care of by Dr. Rumer.

Waiting with him.<br />The police suggest the father keep a journal incase he thinks of something that might help them in their search.  So he writes even when he feels he should be out looking for his son. The hours turn into days and he continues to write and explore his thoughts and feelings.  Sadly, he realizes that the distance began even before Robby was abducted.  As painful as the physical separation is the knowledge that he was mentally separated as well cuts deep.  His mind was often on other things, work or chores. Misplaced priorities and other responsibilities seemed more important or pressing at the time. This was a difficult realization to come to.  How he longed for another chance for that father/son basketball game.  This emotional separation is something we've all probably felt at one time or another.<br />This is Kirk Martin's second novel.

Short chapters for quick pick ups.  The rich run the town and think they can get away with murder. Memorial Day weekend at one of the richest zip codes on earth, The Hamptons. Peter Mullen is a free-spirited young man who dropped out of high school and parked cars for one of the area's richest families, the Neubauer's.  Arriving late for his job at the first major party of the season he got right to work.  After the rush of the arriving guests has stopped Peter is given a note on pink scented stationary that suggests a clandestine meeting on the beach.  Peter thinks he knows who the note is from and does not hesitate to head down to the beach.  The next morning Peter is found dead on the beach, the Neubauers and their friends insist that he drowned.  But Peter's older brother Jack (a law-school student) knows that Peter was beaten to death. But why and how can he prove it? As he is searching for the truth Jack uncovers Peter's secret life and the reason Peter could afford to pay cash for the brand new 130-horsepower BMW K1200 motorcycle and why someone might want to silence him. Jack's father (who never really got over the death of his wife years ago) dies of a heartattack over the loss of his son. Jack, with the help of a private investigator (of the female persuasion who becomes a love interest), plus Macklin, his elderly grandfather and some of their friends, set out to prove that Peter was murdered and that billionaire Barry Neubauer caused his demise.  Revenge is sweet. There are crooked cops, medical personnel that are paid for their testimony, sexual scandal and blackmail involved.<br />Will the good guys overcome? Read it to find out.	2002-06-11

He keeps you guessing as to who are the good guys &amp; who are the bad. I got caught up in the twists &amp; turns of this skilled writer.

She is also an heiress to Jacob Chandler's estate.  But who is Jacob Chandler?  That's what Benni has to find out. Benni is intrigued and so am I. How does Chandler know her?  Why has he named her sole heir in his will?  That is the challenge &amp; she has 2 weeks to follow the clues he left for her. I felt like I was playing the board game &quot;CLUE&quot; (Professor Plum did it in the Library with a candlestick).  It was great!<br />Benni finds friends &amp; foes along the way but I found this to be a &quot;wholesome&quot; mystery.<br />This book has it all; there's a loyal dog, a handsome cop, good friends, &amp; close relatives. I loved the &quot;sit-in&quot; at the local museum to keep it from being moved all orchestrated by the San Celina Seven, headed up by Benni's own grandmother!<br />Fowler's Benni Harper, is a reoccurring character in a series of books but you don't need to read any of the other books in the series to enjoy Mariner's Compass, but you'll want to.	2001-11-21

I read that &quot;Shadow&quot; was a good read and it wasn't necessary to read &quot;Valley&quot; first.  I wish I had but I don't know if it would have changed my mind.  Perhaps  their's, Anne and Neely, is just not my life style and I couldn't relate to the characters.  I just borrowed &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; from my library.  I'll see if this is better and if it makes &quot;Shadow of the Dolls&quot; better.	2001-08-14

The author creates the story behind one of Vermeer's most celebrated paintings, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;. Griet is that girl. She is from a simple upbringing and due to her father's accident on the job he is unable to work.  She must work to earn money to help the family and is sent to work for an upper class family as a servant. The family is that of the famous painter, Johannes Vermeer. She has a sense of color and organization that captures the painter's interest from the moment he meets her. With Griet in their home there is lots of tension, which is ruled over by the Vermeer's jealous, clumsy, eternally pregnant wife and his mother-in-law. Griet is quiet but strong. As the story continues Griet finds that she is falling in love with Vermeer.  I also believe that Vermeer respects and loves Griet as much as a self-absorbed person can love. But this love can never be fulfilled.  For not standing up for Griet I feel that Vermeer tried to apologize in the end.  The author captures life in 1660s Delft, Holland beautifully. The book was a pleasure to read from beginning to end.	2001-05-23

Grieving process was handled in a sleepy state with flashbacks to their life when Drew was alive. I would have stopped reading it but I kept hoping that there would be a lesson in it some where. The Mother and daughter reconnected...supportive friends - that was good, but it just wasn't worth it.	2001-05-02

I've wished to run away at times too.  This is a light, cheery, truthful story.  Can easily be read in one sitting but the feeling behind it stays for a long time.  Go on and call your Mom and say &quot;I love you&quot;.  Been there, done that....is there a T-Shirt?  I highly recommend this book.	2001-04-29

Knows her place but does what is necessary for her family. Well-developed characters.  Some you love to hate.  Tracy Chevalier's description of everyday life back in the late 1600's is as clear as if she were there. Is this the true story behind Vermeer's painting of the same name?  Whatever your age, it's an enjoyable novel.	2001-04-29

He leaves Kenzie and Gennaro behind and embarks on a new chilling tale.  It's as dark as his previous books. A stranger approaches three boys, childhood friends, and one of them is abducted.  The boy escapes four days later and never reveals the horror he endured. It seems to me that no one lets him face it.  It's all just pushed under the rug.  After this tragic event the boys lose touch.  We come to these boys' years later, all grown up.  One has become a local investigator, and the other two are related by marriage.  They are brought together when one of the men's daughters has been killed.  We see how they've learned to cope with the demons of the past and how it affects their decisions in the present. How something that was left to fester becomes out of control.  We learn that things are not always as they seem on the surface. He is somewhat lengthy when getting to the point.  The ending was rather flat.  Lehane is a talented writer - the characters are good and the story is not bad for a first attempt away from a much-loved series. It's not one of his best but I'll read any new books by Dennis Lehane, however, I do look forward to another Kenzie/Gennaro story.	2001-04-25

After reading the description of the book I couldn't wait to for it to be released to read it.  I was terribly disappointed.  The book started out good but got extremely boring in the middle.  Towards the end it picked up a little but the killer is pretty lame.  I have read other books by Bradford and think that she needs to stick to that genre and stay away from mystery/thrillers.  Sorry Barbara.	2001-04-24

His style of writing was comfortable and the print style and size was real easy on the eyes - I even checked to see if I bought a &quot;large print&quot; edition but I didn't.  I normally like short chapters, but these are very short.  It really seemed to break things up just as I got lost in it. A homicide inspector, a medical examiner, a reporter and an assistant DA make up The Women's Murder Club.  I loved Claire, the medical examiner, who's a kind, nurturing woman.  Lindsay is a great character and I look forward to seeing more of her.  I felt I knew &quot;who dun it&quot; but found I was wrong.  There are 3 possible endings to this book.  I thought it would be the second possible ending.  But the ending Patterson choose was a surprise to me! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. I look forward to another meeting of The Women's Murder Club.	2001-04-19

It doesn't have to have a happy ending just an ending.  I wonder about the Ricky, the Latchers, Pop and Gran.  The only one that seems happy is Luke's mom. Luke is optimistic.  The story is written very well.  I like Grisham's style of writing but I need to know more about their futures.	2001-03-10
