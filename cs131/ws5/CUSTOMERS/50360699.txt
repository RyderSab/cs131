I thought that Casting the First Stone was a much more exciting book. I was not thrill with the way Curtis ended up in an adultrous affair.  It was as if Curtis had turned back to his ways and he was able to feed off of his lusts.  I don't know if this happens in the churches.  But it would be a shame to know that the leader of the congregation was unable to handle his own affairs in his own home.  He should have been more selective when hiring assistant ministers for his congregation.	2005-03-16

From the first page to the last page, I definitely enjoyed the book.  It captured my attention and I found myself running as if my life depended on it. Keisha and Jamal were in love from childhood. Noone understood or cared.  Aunt Margaret was 90 years old and blind, but she knew that Keisha and Jamal loved it other and she did what any aunt would do for their neice.  She protected her. I respect the loyalty that Jamal had for Keisha, and how Keisha grew from little girl to a woman within days of events that kept me on the edge of my chair.<br /><br />The book took me to a world that full of wealth, deception and pure intelligence. I got a chance to explore Frank and Rev. Anderson mind and what caused them to react to certain situations. I saw that both of their personal relationship were falling apart.  I also saw where revenge takes you to level in life that you really need God to intervene on your behalf.<br /><br />The twist of the book, took me by surprise.  I read carefully how Lt. Lynch was trying to solve the different murders and carjacking that had taken place.  He had the people in custody, Nola Langston, very rich, very beautiful.  But the twist really shocked me.  Throughout the whole book, I would never had imagine this particular person to be capable of hiring a hit man or committing murder.  This person appeared to have a mild personality.  Even though their childhood was pain and hurt.  The twist was so good, I said, Oh My God!!!<br /><br />The ending was a surprise also. Love covers a multitude of sins.<br /><br />Even though the book was not preachy, I believe the author brought out some good and negative points about who we are as human beings, and what are our true motives for the things that we do and say.  And what length would we go to for someone we truly love.	2004-09-13

I started reading this book at the hair salon.  The book was so good, I immediately went home and continue to read.  I could not wait after each chapter, to see what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Here is the scene.  After Nate finds out his wife Monica can not have children, Nate plans to get a divorce.  Nate plans goes smoothly and then things begin to backfire on him.  His adulterous girlfriend turns on him also.<br /><br />Nate was a very rich man, he was selfish and his character showed he only cared for himself.  When he needed help from his brother Tim, Nate used manipulated motives to try and make his brother Tim help in Nates schemes.  Nate pushed his wife Monica into the arms of a Lewis. Lewis was a guy trying to make a living as a barber.  He was a good hearted guy, trying to do things right.  I enjoyed Lewis character, particular concerning the welfare of his daughter, Laylala. Lewis was down on his luck and going through hard times when he ran into the back of Nate's expensive car. Nate's attitude toward Lewis was hatred.  I saw Nate has one who looked down on Lewis and this gave Nate opportunity to put his plans into motion concerning divorcing Monica (his wife) for all the selfish reasons. I can understand Nate wanting a child. Monica even tried to do things to help in the situation where she was unable to bear Nate a child.  She was willing to do other options.  Nate was a coward and in the end, Monica received a fourth of Nate's money.<br /><br />The book was well written.  I like the way RM Johnson wrote in detail describing each character. The way Nate had to explain to Lewis the type of lifestyle Monica was used to living, in order for Lewis to catch her attention.<br /><br />I wish that Lewis could have taken the money he received and possible open up his own barbershop.  Maybe I misunderstood the ending.  But why did Lewis return to the projects where his live-in girlfriend died?  Was it because Lewis had paid the rent for the entire year?  I am just curious about the ending.<br /><br />To find out more, go and buy the book.  It is well worth it. RM Johnson I congradulate you.s it because Lewis had paid the rent for the entire year?  I am just curious about the ending. <br /> <br />To find out more, go and buy the book.  It is well worth it. RM Johnson I congradulate you.	2004-09-09

But overall the book was well written.<br />Pastor Landris and Theresa are about to be married in two weeks.  Between those (2) weeks, so much drama has taken place and the book had me sitting on the edge of my seat.  Theresa character was well developed.  However, I was a little surprise as to how Pastor Landris character was written.  It surprised me, that a man could love a woman so much that he would go to the length that Pastor Landris went to in order to be a comfort to Johnny Mae's family.  I saw Pastor Landris as way too perfect.  It was as if nothing bothered him.  It was like he had it all together. Like he was superman.  Overall the book was a page turner.	2004-06-22
US	50360699	RC28MJ82FCVYZ	1583144501	672203887	Soul Journey	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Anointed	This book was well written.  It showed the struggles of being a woman called to preached.  Journee was called to preached from her mother's womb.  Her mother dedicated Journee back to the Lord, just as Hannah did in First Samuel.  I still wonder did her father accept the calling on Journee life.  Or did he support Journee because she was his daughter.  Nevertheless the book was full of surprises.<br />I believe that Journee was a little naive when she got involved in counseling Kingston by herself. It opened the door for the enemy to come in. I believe Journee should have gotten Rev. McKinney involved in the counseling process. This would have gave no room for the enemy to place havoc in her life and cause a bunch of confusion and misunderstandings. But things happen and that is as real as you can get.  Kingston got exactly what he deserved.  The old saying goes &quot;everything that shine ain't gold&quot;.	2004-06-21

Incarcerated men who ladies are out there waiting.  It surprise me, that these women were so faithful to their mates.  As I continued to read, I was enlightened by the commitment each lady had for their man.  There was a twist near the end of the book, that surprise me.  It turned out better than I expected.  I enjoyed this book.  I looked at it from both points of view.  I tried to place myself in the shoes of these ladies that were waiting on their man to get out of prison. Alexis took me on an  emotional ride, my heart went out to her.  I will be recommending this book to my book club.  I'm sure this will be a very good topic.	2004-06-10

But there is one guy they are unable to runaway.<br />Can you guess who it is?<br />I will tell you this, it is one of the guys who promised Bunches brother he would look after her.<br />Ibn was well educated but had double standards when it came to woman.  In the end it cost him the woman he truly loved.<br />Dexter wanted to get out of a relationship, but a surprise was waiting for him and he tried to do the correct thing and handle his business.<br />Collins was a mama's boy and very naive, and I truly believe that Collins just wanted to be loved.  He did get with someone who respected and cared for him and lifted his low self esteemed.<br />Mike, oh Mike, now I liked Mike, he seemed to have it together for most of the time.  But when it came to Bunches, he too was over protective.  For all the wrong reasons.  He also tried to live in the past with a girl he always liked.  This girl had become saved and he tried to get with it.  But in the end his heart led him to the right lady.<br />This was a good book, very entertaining.	2003-07-08

He tried to keep Robert with a level head, but only in the end did Robert realize that Don was right and he lost a woman who stood by him and all the trifling things that he manage to do and turn around and make it seem as if it was Nia fought.<br />Let's not forget Sheila and her unusual way of thinking.<br />Robert's sister Kim kept it real.  I wished she had met someone also.  But the twists and turn that took place was so real.  I felt as if I was in St. Louis going through the pain and struggle that Nia felt.<br />My heart was in my mouth when Kalif and Nia went upstairs and Robert followed them at Don's surprise engagement party.<br />I was glad for the turn around for Uncle Lucky, poor Taylor had everything, but in the end she lost the man that everyone thought was so wonderful and smart.<br />But I won't tell anymore of the book.  It was well worth reading.  I enjoyed it and I would definitely support the author again.<br />My heart was sad near the end, if you catch my drift.<br />I have one question for the author.  Did Theresa and Robert get together or did he go after the Nurse?	2003-05-17

I'm looking forward to Rebecca's next book.<br />My favorite character was Taylor, I thought he was a little wild but exciting.  I also liked Deja, she had problems with her ex, but soon she woke up and got her life together and found someone decent and godly.<br />All the characters were well written, even Ms. Lilly.  She was a meaniee, but she had a good heart.  She loved her family and she truly did love her husband.  I hate she had become sick, but through sickness it brought the family much closer.
