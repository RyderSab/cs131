When I heard he was writing a trilogy taking place after the NJO series I was looking forward to this book.  I was looking forward to the continuation of the next generation of Star Wars heroes.  What I got was a very well written book, a hazy kind of plot and a return of Han Solo and company to the fore.  I was surprised to see that the Dark Nest Saga takes place 5 years after the conclusion of the NJO series.  The book begins with a focus on Jaina but quickly loses the youthful drive.  There is very little character development of the younger generation that so characterized Star by Star.  Jaina and Jacen are virtual strangers, Tahiri (one of the more interesting characters is practically overlooked).  Perhaps there will be more in the second and third books but I was disappointed.  I don't agree with some of the decisions that Denning made regarding the characters.  That is more a question of personal preference.  I thought that overall The Joiner King was a good read.  I enjoyed it and I found most of the story enthralling.  As a story that focuses on the older generation(Luke, Leia, Han, Mara), it is fine and once again, Denning is able to successfully integrate information revealed in the movies into the book and into the expanded universe.  I just wish he had put in more information from the NJO series, (Luke's near fatal wounding at the end of the series it totally overlooked).  Like I said a good story, once again Denning proves he can write a good yarn, but I think it reduced the role of the next generation of Jedi to spectators.	2005-08-06

When Trafalger had ended, Sharpe was united with his love Lady Grace, her husband conveniently shot while attempting to murder her.  When Sharpe's Prey opens, Sharpe is wearing his traditional green jacket of the rifles, but our hero is tough to recognize.  Grace died from childbirth complications, along with the baby.  Sharpe's fortune has once again been eaten up and he is penniless.  His commission is worthless and he is not very happy with his military career.  Yet Sharpe comes out on top and soon he finds himself in a secret mission with a gentleman to Denmark.  After his defeat at Trafalger, Napoleon is desperately looking for ships to use against the naval power of Britain.  Denmark's fleet is tempting and the British want that fleet safe in English ports while the Danes disagree.  Soon Sharpe is in over his head in a world of spies and double crosses all while the English invade the peninsular kingdom.  What follows is a tale of love, revenge and war, culminated by the British bombardment of Copenhaggan a little remembered event in world history.  As always Cornwell does a fine job but this time he outshines himself.	2005-03-20

The movie Enemy at the Gates is based in part on this book.  I'm a graduate student in history and before reading this book I spent the better part of a semester researching and writing about the failure of the Nazi's at Stalingrad.  As such I became very well aquainted with the battle.  I found War of the Rats to be an extremely compelling book and overall an accurate one.  The dual between Zaitsev and Thorvald while being the central focus of the book was not really the focus because the story was about people, the soldiers role in the battle.  I found the final confrontation between Zaitsev and Thorvald to be a little anti-climactic and abbreviated but then again a well aimed bullet takes no time to kill someone.  This is a compelling book and serves to introduce the reader to a place far from the shores of Normandy where many more people died to stop the Nazis.	2005-03-18

The plot is almost a rehash of an amalgamation of Sharpe books.  That is the problem.  Although the book is interesting and fun to read, it's not that original.  Major Starbuck is transferred to command of a punishment battalion filled with cowardly officers and corrupt sergeants.  His second in command is a situational conformist who wants to rape, pillage and plunder and stay well away from battle.  With the help of a drunken but loveable officer named Potter (reminiscent of Harry Price from the Sharpe series), Starbuck must get the battalion in fighting order in time for Antietam.  Starbuck has to worry about bullets from behind and in front as the Civil Wars bloodiest day commences.  The battle of Antietam is well written and this book is enjoyable enough.  In fact, I wish that Cornwell would finish the series and go through the entire war.  OVerall a fun and interesting read, but too much like Sharpe	2005-03-17

This book covers a battle that always springs up in Civil War history but is often overlooked, Second Manasas.  I found this story interesting and fun to read, but if anyone has read Sharpe before there are many similarities to it.  Stupid commanding officers to concerned with their authority, evil soldiers who believe war is an excuse to rape, pillage and plunder.  Starbuck is the commander of the Legion, but his authority is tenuous.  The battle itself is well written and I enjoyed it.  I found the introduction of Starbuck's father intriguing considering in many ways he is the catalyst in the series.  Once again I don;t really care for the Adam Falcouner story, although at least he is showing more guts instead of the previous books.  One issue I had with this story is that Cornwell does seem to be unfair to Longstreet.  Longstreet was held up before Manassas by Union cavalry under Buford, the same man who would later hold the high ground at Gettysburg.  Most historians concur that the exact moment that Longstreet struck the Union flank was the most crucial moment to attack so I believe that Cornwell gives him a bit of a short shaft.	2005-03-17
US	50896776	R3IUM2S89VY0E2	006093462X	98247467	Copperhead	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Nice contribution to the Starbuck Chronicles	Nate Starbuck is a Captain in the Confederate Army who finds hostility on both sides of the war.  Nate is a Bostonian fighting for the South.  The North hates him because he is fighting against them and the South hates him because he's a Yankee.  Despite this Starbuck has the makings of a good soldier.  Much too good for General Falcouner, Nate's one time benefactor and now avowed enemy.  Starbuck is transferred to a desk job in Richmond where due to the incmpatence of northern spies he is fingered as a Union agent.  Cornwell's description of Nate captivity is gut-churning, and his dramatic storytelling keeps the reader full of suspence.  His introduction of Patrick Lassan is a great nod to his Sharpe books, as Lassan is the son of Richard Sharpe and his lady widow.  I thought that was neat.  What I found tedious is the character of Adam Falcouner and sometimes Cornwell's description of northern and southern Christians is a little much.  Not everyone is the religious fanatic he writes.  I found Copperhead to be superior to Rebel in many ways but it still had its weaknesses.	2005-03-16

Rebel follows the adventures of Nate Starbuck the son of a radical Bostonian abolutionist in Virginia at the beginning of the Civil War.  Nate ran away from home with an actress, arrived in Virginia and was promptly dropped by the woman.  He is saved from a tar & feathering by one George Washington Falcouner a wealthy member of the Virginia aristocracy.  From there, Nate joins the Confederate Army and is involved in the Battle of Bull Run.  During the course of this book, Nate goes from being a timid PK to becoming an able soldier and officer.  Despite it's difference in time period, the Starbuck Chronicles follow a pattern in Cornwell's writing.  Most of Cornwell protaganists are men (and women) who don't fit in with the company they find themselves keeping.  Richard Sharpe is a common man who becomes an officer to the chagrin of the aristocracy, Derfel from the Warlord series is a Saxon keeping company with Britons, Thomas of Hookton from the Grail Quest series is the illegitamate son of a priest, and Starbuck is a northerner fighting for the South.  If one were to just pick up Rebel and read it, the taut battles scenes and interesting characters are certainly worth it, but if you have read all of Cornwell's books, the character seems a little redundant.  Overall however, Cornwell keeps his excellent attention to historical detail and writes a book that is interesting and enjoyable.	2005-03-16

Sharpe is on his way home from India when he meets up with the captain of the HMS Calliope.  After helping the captain get some money back, Sharpe finds out that his shipmates aboard the ship home include a former enemy, a member of parliament accompanied by his aloof wife Grace.  Filled with stirring battles, suspense and passionate love, Sharpe's Trafalger is a rolicking adventure yarn where Sharpe meets the great Admiral Nelson in a battle to save England from invasion.  This is a fun book, but it is not one of my favorites.  I have no problems with it except that sometimes the story is overdramatic.  However, this is an important addition to the Sharpe's series as it establishes much of what happens later in the series.	2005-03-14

It sums up all the events of the Clone War into a readable and interesting novel.  This is perhaps James Luceno's best Star Wars novel.  Certainly out of all the post-episode II authors, he has characterized the main characters the best.  His Obi-Wan is the not the more formal and stiff warrior from pre-episode II novels, nor is he the perfect and polished Jedi in the previous book, The Cestus Deception.  Instead, Luceno's Kenobi is an extremely competant and powerful Jedi plagued by events beyond his control.  He makes mistakes, and often times things will occur despite Kenobi's careful planning.  Luceno's Kenobi is much more like the Kenobi of episode II.  One problem I did have is that Jedi Kenobi is more like Anakin's Skywalker's subordinate not his leader.  Throughout the book, Kenobi is always telling Anakin that he will \\"follow his lead.\\"  The Anakin Skywalker of Labrynth of Evil is much more in character with a young man who will become Darth Vader.  Luceno does a good job of giving Anakin a brooding anger that could explosively come forth.  However, the teen angst that was displayed in Episode II does not come through at all.  I like the fact that  Dan Sherman's docile Anaking from Jedi Trial is overlooked.  One of the most interesting aspects of Labrynth of Evil is that you could literally put it down and then begin watching Episode III.  I won't give away much of the story, but Labrynth of Evil takes place as the Clone Wars seem to be drawing to a close.  The Seperatists have been driven from many of their strongholds and seem to be in full retreat.  Obi-Wan and Anakin find themselves hunting down the elusive Darth Sidious, while Chancellor Palpatine drives the Republic forward.  Yet there is something amiss on Curuscant and not everything is as it seems with Palpatine.  Overall I give Luceno 4 stars because although it is a very good book, it's not Stackpole or Zahn or even Denning, but this is certainly Luceno'sbest Star Wars book.	2005-01-28

Along the way, there are many many battle descriptions that are well done. The military background of the author's is obvious. Although I'm not sure that the Jedi would have studied Napoleon and used his tactics in such a big battle, but hey I'm a military historian, so I should recognize that stuff. The side stories involving individual stories are interesting however, they seem to overwhelm the main characters. What gets this book 3 stars is the weak characterization of Anakin Skywalker in the beginning of the book. He is portrayed not as a character who has already fallen to the dark side once, but as a more happy, but impatient Padawan. It's not till the end that the characterization becomes slightly accurate and the dark side of Skywalker comes out kinda of. Nejaa Halcyon is underused and that was truly dissappointing. Overall, Jedi Trial is not a very good Star Wars book.	2005-01-28

Now a Sergeant, Richard Sharpe finds himself feeling something like ambition to rise in the British Army.  Despite his excellent fighting abilities, Sharpe is destined to languish in the British ranks.  Despite this, he is happy, his job is easy and his hidden fortune makes him able to live better than some officers.  However, it is almost impossible for a British soldier to become an officer unless he performes an act of suicidal bravery in front of an influential officer.  As an aide to a member of the East India Company military, Sharpe seems unlikely to ever have his chance.  But fate intervenes and just as the battle of Assaye begins Sergeant Sharpe finds himself as an aide to Arthur Wellesley, commander of the British forces at Assaye.  When Wellesley is unhorsed and surrounded it is up to Sharpe to save him and claim his destiny.  Cornwell continues to explore the background of his classic character.  Readers of the initial Sharpe series have heard about Assaye, but here it finally is in all its bloody glory.  Corwell is among the most realistic of combat novelists and his battle descriptions are as good as any history book.  Well done Mr. Cornwell.	2005-01-24

In Sharpe's Tiger Private Richard Sharpe is in India fighting with the 33rd Regiment.  His regimental officer is inept, and his sergeant is the evil Hakeswill, but overall Sharpe is happy.  Then, his woman catches the eyes of his superiors and Sharpe is set up for death.  He is tricked into hitting an officer and sentenced to a brutal flogging.  Yet, despite the flogging Sharpe is saved by his colonel Arthur Wellesley and sent on a secret mission with a young officer named Lawford.  Sent to a impregnable fortress controlled by the Tippoo, Sharpe must battle British and native forces to complete his mission.  Failure means hideous death, but success could lead him to more wealth than he could possibly imagine.  Once again Bernard Cornwell writes a rolicking adventure.  By taking Sharpe back to the beginning, Cornwell brings an added dimension to his classic character.  It is interesting to see Sharpe grow and mature as a soldier.  Overall, I highly recommend this volume of historical fiction.	2005-01-24

Having successfully finished off his novels on the American Revolution, Jeff Shaara turns to a different war in a different time period.  For the first time he tackles an era with totally different characters and environments.  The people in World War I, are new and different compared to the more recognizable characters Shaara has dealt with before.  He does not attempt to narrate the entire war, but he deals with some of the more recognizable characters including the Red Baron and General Pershing.  But at the same time his others characters are not as well known, but they are made incredibly human.  From people like a raw British recruit to Captain Patton, Shaara gives a very unique and realistic look at the first World War.  This book is not as abstract as the classic All Quiet on the Western Front, but it is an incredible story and should be required reading for any person who wants to understand exactly what war is about and what people think during a war.  While I consider Shaara's revolutionary war books to be his best, this one is among his strongest.  I highly recommend it.	2005-01-17

A terrorist incident perpetrated by radical Irish terrorist is foiled by an American tourist.  That begins a story fo revenge, danger and fanaticism.  While there is plenty of techinical information, Clancy had not yet perfected the technical technique.

Ironically, its the paperback books that are the better stories as opposed to the hardcover.  While I was disappointed with the book about Mace Windu, Yoda's Dark Rendevous is really an excellent story.  It presents Yoda as a teacher not as an all knowing master of the force.  Stewart also has a way of writing other characters that is both realistic and interesting.  The people and aliens he brings into the book seem to be real people.  This book could have been just a Yoda versus Dooku and it was not and for that I am grateful. We see much more of the Jedi Temple and much more of the Padawans, and we see that it's not just Anakin Skywalker who is strong in the force.  Anakin's dark side does come out a little and he is more closely aligned with the Anakin in the movies than with the disappointing Jedi Trial.  I rate this book very highly and is among the best of the Star Wars prequal era books.	2004-12-06

In Republic Commando, Karen Travis succeeds at doing this better than any previous Clone Wars author.  I was not expecting much from this book, I read it mainly for entertainment.  I hoped it would be pretty good, but was not expecting anything better than the Ruins of Dantooine that came out last year.  To my surprise, Republic Commando is an excellent edition to the Star Wars universe.  So much so, that I hope it becomes a series.  Travis presented a new look at the Jedi and at the clones.

The story was prediactable.  The struggles of Barriss in regards to the so called \\"wonder drug\\" was overrated.  It just didn't involve me with the characters  as much as the first book did.  While there were some humorous elements and some interesting relationships, the identity of the spy at the end was no surprise and the authors failed to emotionally involve the reader in the story the way they did in the first book.  The book was technically well-written and it was not the worst Star Wars book ever written, in fact I would put it in the average to slightly above average Star Wars books categories, but it just wasn't as strong as I'd hoped it would be.	2004-10-16

Enter James Arthur Stuart, an army officer, who is told by an old man named Merlin that he is the legitimate heir to the throne.  It turned out that he was conceived in secret and his existence hidden, raised by a foster family, in much the same way as King Arthur was.  Lawhead adds contemporary versions of Arthur's knights and advisors as well as his enemies.  Sometimes this book gets lost in Lawhead's rather grandiosse style which fits much better with the ancient rather than the contemporary, but overall, this is an enjoyable and interesting novel.

While the cycle continues on for three more books, the series could have ended here, for Lawhead provides a well-written overview of Arthur as a child, young king, and veteran king.  Narrated by those around Arthur, the story takes the old legend and breathes new life into it.  Most of the beloved parts of the Arthur legend are from the sword in the stone, to the Lady of the Lake to the dissapearance of Avalon, Lawhead does it all in one novel.  Although a section after Arthur's marriage is explored in Pendragon and Grail, Arthur gives a complete picture of the warrior king with several twists and turns along the way.  Merlin, the king's tutor and advisor looses his sight in a battle with Morgian is just one example of the way Lawhead creates a different take on the old tale.

Merlin is the second book in Stephen R. Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle.  Merlin picks up following the events of Taliesin, which saw Atlantean Princess Charis marrying Bard Taliesin, the birth of their son Merlin, and Taliesin's murder by Charis' half-sister Morgan.  This book can be diveded into about 3 parts.  The first is the story of Merlin's childhood, where is is taught wisdom by both Druids, Priests and former kings of Atlantis.  The second deals with Merlin's brief reign as a warrior Celtic prince, story of love and war, ending in tragedy.  The final part of the book deals with Merlin as a kingmaker and ends with the birth of Arthur.  Set in the time period just after the end of Roman occupation, Lawhead combines history with Celtic mythology to create a very different look at the story of Arthur.  Very few writers take their works as far back as Lawhead does, and very, very few are as detailed and interesting.  Although there are many elements of magic in this book, it can almost be described as historical fiction as opposed to fantasy, yet enough fantastic elements remain to make this a terrific read.	2004-08-02

Lawheads excellent Pendragon Cycle.  It begins on the lost continent of Atlantis and takes the reader on a remarkable journey to the British Isles.  The two main characters are Charis, daughter of one of the most powerful Atlantean kings and Talieson, a baby found in a fishing weir.  Their story is a remarkable journey through dense Celtic jungles and its really an incredible read.  Lawhead tells the stories of Talieson and Charis until the two become emeshed and their union culminates in the birth of Merlin, half Altlantean, half who knows.  Anyway this is a remarkable book.  The first time I read it over 7 years ago, I could not put it down, and even today I still can't.	2004-08-01

The Cestus Deception helped to transform the clones from drones to actual people, while Star Wars: Medstar 1: Battle Surgeons Medstar 1 by MICHAEL REAVES, STEVE PERRY, looks at the consequences of battle.  Impressions received from other expanded universe books as well as from the movies hint that all medical treatment is given by droids, but Reaves and Perry prove that that is not the case here.  Surgeons are the main characters in this book. Even the Jedi Barriss Offee, last seen in Foster's The Approaching Storm does much more healing than fighting.  Life is not just compartmentalized and the idea that clones are real people is also pushed.  Things are difficult and patients are lost all the time for the weary doctors drafted into a war about economics.  Also interesting was the return of I-Five a droid from Reaves Shadow Hunter whose fate was left up for grabs in the previous book.  Overall an interesting if not particularly complex read, Battle Surgeons is a welcome addition to the expanded universe.	2004-07-05

The Cestus Deception brings together, everyone's favorite investigative Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi along with Kit Fisto (the Jedi that knocked over C-3PO'c battle droid body).  The two Jedi are sent on a mission to the world of Cestus, which has been bringing out a new type of droid known as the JK (for Jedi Killers).  While Kenobi attempt to bring Cestus back into the Republic fold, Fisto along with 3 Clone Troopers attempts rally the desperate farmers and miners in a fight against corporate oppressiom.  Filled with double and triple crosses, this book is certainly interesting and while it is full of surprises, this story truly holds the readers attention and is well-crafted.  Most intriguing are the chapters regarding an ARC Clone Trooper Captain known as Nate.  This is the first look in to the mind of a clone trooper and while Barnes is a little obvious with where the character ends up, his journey is both interesting and insightful.  Overall, I give this book a high 5 stars.  Anyway read and enjoy!	2004-06-02

The story iself was interesting although it was written in a more juvenile manner.  Overall, The Ruins of Dantooine seems to be an attempt to create a storyline reminiscent of the X-Wing books.  Stories based on the video games but driven by characters and events rather thatn visuals.  There are two problems with this idea, one is that the X-Wing books were written by 2 superior writers.  Whitney-Robinson is a fine writer but she is not a superior one.    The stories from the X-Wing books were much stronger and while a sequal has been set up for the Galaxies book, there is little interest in completing Dusque adventures.  This book is not bad and its a fine read if you want something that is really just fluff, but it's hampered either by the authors limitations or (more likely) by restrictions placed on the author by the publishing company.	2004-06-02

Jeter, continues the story of Boba Fett immediately after the debacle in the Sarlaac's belly and in flashback to a time at the beginnings of the galactic rebellion.  Jeter continues to weave in interesting characters and to make tell interesting tales, but his inclusion of the Kuati storyline makes the thrust of the trilogy increasingly predictable.  He also spends too much time in Fett's head, rather than drawing primarily on people's reactions to Fett, which would make the authors point but at the same time keep an air of mystery about the bounty hunter.  OVerall, Jeter writes a solid if prediactable tale outside the normal Star Wars genera, which does tend to keep the storyline nice and dark, a change during a time period when the expanded universe seemed to be going through a bit of a dry spell in the original ideas department.  His ideas are new, but the way he implements them makes this book predictable but still enjoyable.	2004-05-31

Jeter continues the story of Boba Fett, Neelah and Dengar after the battle on Tatooine.  This book had the most surprises and was really unique in both the style and tone.  I really enjoyed reading it.  Overall the only problem I really had with the series was the characterization of Dengar as a not so brutal bounty hunter, something that takes away a little from the character.  Other than that I have to give Jeter high marks for effort.  He took the most mysterious and one of the most cherished characters in the Star Wars universe and crafted a well-written tale that did not totally destroy the perception of that character.  Well done Mr. Jeter.	2004-05-31

Jeter is the first in the Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy.  It is a well-written look at the Star Wars universe through the eyes of characters who are pivotal to the series yet usually ignored (with the exception of someone named Fett) At the heart of this story, which takes place directly after the Sail Barge battle in Return of the Jedi and flashes back several years during the course of the story, is the contact between bounty hunters Dengar, Boba Fett and a dancer names Neela.  The flashback sequences are fascinating and bring back Prince Xizor, a top notch character.  Overall this book is well-written and interesting if almost totally prediactable.  I figured out what would happen in the first 20 pages.  Yet, the book manages to keep the readers interest and has fun doing it.  Along the way familiar and new Star Wars characters pop up, creating a feeling of comfortable newness.  Anyway while certainly not a top-notch Star Wars book, The Mandalorian Armor is an above average book.  I wish amazon had 3 and a half star ratings because that is what I would have given this book, because is doesn't deserve a four but a three is really marking it as average.	2004-05-30

The Revolution had just begun at the end of his previous work Rise to Rebellion and now the fighting becomes fierce.  Shaara again follows the perspectives of some of histories greatest people: Benjamin Franklin, working hard for the cause in France, Nathaniel Green, a Quaker turned general fighting the British, Lord Cornwallis, a brilliant British strategist who escapes the war only to turn back to it after tragedy strikes &amp; George Washington the rock of the Revolution a man who must lead a rabble of bickering colonies through defeat to become one nation.  It's a powerful story filled with great characterizations and just excellent story telling.  Washington's struggles are heart-wrenching, while Franklin's battles in the diplomatic field are just as fierce as any fought with cannon.  Also impressive is Shaara's take on Cornwallis.  In America, there is a tendency to look on Cornwallis as a bit of a fool for losing to the combined American-French Armies, but he was the best British general in the war.  His strenghth of character clearly comes through here.  I also liked the fact that Shaara disproves the popular battle of Cowpens scene from Mel Gibson's movie The Patriot.  Cornwallis never took part in Cowpens and he probably wouldn't have been beaten in the same way.  Also interesting was his age which was under 45.  Most portray him as at least 50+.  I think the The Glorious Cause is Shaara's best novel to date.  His writing skills have truly evolved and he is fast becoming a master of historical fiction.	2004-04-19

The first of Shaara's novels were in a way the continuation of what his father had begun.  Rise to Rebellion begins a two book set on the American Revolution and the events leading up to this momentous event in history.  Following his previous style of writing, Shaara concentrates on just a few of the men involved in this event that changed the shape of the world.  There is John Adams, a lawyer so honest that he defends the British accused of murder after the Boston Massacre, Ben Franklin, a man of science and great wit, spending time in England trying to help alleviate the situation and Thomas Gage, a British general who does not see the danger in the way he handles different situations in Boston.  There are brief flashes of our other Founding Fathers: Sam Adams, Joseph Warren, John Hancock, Patrick Henry, and of course George Washington, a man whose role in history will be assured by events taking place in the second book.  Shaara is masterful in this book, but it is nothing compared to the sequal.	2004-04-16

It tells the story of a war that divided the country before the Civil War and Shaara tells the story well, but there is little of the emotional impact that carried through his previous novels.  Perhaps some of the characters were simply getting a little old, but there was something just a little stale about Gone for Soldiers.  I enjoyed it but this book is clearly not as well written as any of Shaara's other work.  Gone for Soldiers follows the stories of General Winfield Scott and Captain Robert E. Lee as they journey to the dry heat of Mexico.  Along the way we meet many familiar faces: Picket, Longstreet, Johnston, Grant and Jackson.  I do think Shaara spends too much time with Lee, rather than focussing on a character a bit more dynamic.  Lee was a courageous officer but at all times he was a gentleman which kind of deadens his impact in a dynamic story.  Gone for Soldiers is a fine novel of the Mexican War, but it is simply not as good as Shaara's Civil War or American Revolution novels.	2004-04-10

Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara is the prequal to the Pulitxer Prize winning novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.  Gods and Generals follows the lives of 4 men in the turbulent days leading up to the Civil War until just before the Battle of Gettysburg.  Thomas Jackson, Robert E. Lee, Winfield Scott Hancock and JOshua Chamberlain are the 4 main characters and in the mix we see glimpses of some of the best known soldiers and civilians of the Civil War Era, including JOhn Brown, JEB Stuart, McClellan, Burnside, Longstreet and Hooker.  Shaara's talent for writing is obvious in the first lines of this work.  He is able to capture both the triumph and tragedy of the Civil War.  When it comes of the battles, his accuracy is almost complete.  Shaara does his research and provides the reader with the thrilling idea of being inside a historical figures mind.  The only complaint I can make is that he does not delve into the insanity that strayed just beneath the surface with Jackson, instead promoting Jackson's obvious if misguided religious beliefs.  Although Gods and Generals was made into a subpar movie, it is a first rate story with compelling character and explosive drama.  Well done Shaara.	2004-04-09

Jeff Shaara continues his father's work with a novel that is as heartwrenching as it is historically accurate.  It was interesting, but when I first read the novel, I happened to be visiting the areas described like Spotsylvania, the Wilderness and Petersburg, and Shaara brings those fight vividly to life.  This time he focusses on 3 main characters, Joshua Chamberlain, Robert E. Lee &amp; US Grant, picking up right after Gettysburg.  As the war rages on to its 3rd year, Shaara accurately plays out the desperation of the Confederacy and the despair of Lee as he struggles to equip an army without food or equipment available.  He also shows Grant in the light that many had never seen before, showing him as both the military genius and capable of making mistakes.  Yet it is his characterization of Chamberlain that is masterful, showing the schoolteachers final evolution from good officer to excellent general, and from battlefield commander to dreadfully wounded casualty.  The Last Full Measure is a masterful work by an author who is taking the field of historical fiction by storm.	2004-04-09

I had seen &quot;Gettysburg&quot; several times and in the summer of 1995, I visited the battlefield for the first time in about 8 years.  I devoured the book, staying up till the wee hours of the morning to finish it the first time, then immediately starting it again.  Nine years later, at age 23, I am working on my Master's Degree in American History, while writing my own manuscript of a historical novel.  That was how deeply I was inspired by Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels.  The book is powerful, moving and enlightening.  One of the keys to understanding history is to understand what those in the past were thinking, and in this magnificent work, Shaara captures what it might have been like to have been on that tragic battlefield.  About 3 years ago I once again visited Gettysburg and while wandering up the dense foliage of Big Round Top and walking along the huge boulders of Devil's Den, I found Shaara's words coming back to me, the descriptions of death and heroism that made Gettysburg a hallowed ground came to vivid life.  I recommend this book even if you are not a historian or really interested in history.  It is one of themost poignant works of the 20th century.	2004-03-28

Written by Aaron Allston, Starfighters of Adumar focuses on a mission undertaken by General Wedge Antilles, Colonel Tycho Celchu, Major Wes Jansen &amp; Major Hobbie Klivian to the planet of Adumar, a place that venerates starfighter pilots.  Once there the pilots find that not only are things different from what they were told but the Imperials are also vying for the planet.  To top it off, their only way to stay alive depends on the undercover Intelligence agent Iella Wessiri who is not exactly feeling happy with Antilles these days.  A fun book, Allston fills the pages with a well-contrived plot, sharp dialogue, heart pounding action and a strong dose of humor.  This is one of the finest books in the X-Wing series and leaves the reader wishing that Allston and Stackpole would both return to the X-wing cockpit to expand on the adventures of these elite fighter pilots.	2004-03-01

Beginning with one of the final scenes from Tim Zahn's The Last Command, Isard's Revenge segues seamlessly into the expanded universe.  With the Imperials once again in retreat, the New Republic looks to liberate some worlds from a psychopathic Warlord named Krennal.  Wedge Antilles, now a general, and the rest of Rogue Squadron are thrust into a espionage ladden maze full of double crosses and unexpected allies.  Not only is danger lurking around every corner but an old enemy arises to give Antilles, Horn and Celchu the ultimate plan to bring down Krennal, but what is the cost of this information?  At times Isard's Revenge is a rip-roaring space saga, at others it does fade a bit, yet overall it's a great read and a compelling comclusion to Stackpole's X-Wing books.	2004-02-29

Iron Fist continues the adventures of the controversial X-Wing unity Wraith Squadron.  After masquerading as Imperials in the last book, the squadron now is disguised as pirates in attempt to bring down Warlord Zinj.  Allston is clearly more comfortable with his characters and they are indeed in rare form.  Yet although these are clearly well-written characters, Allston does not hesitate to kill or injure them.  He also includes a brand new person into the Wraith mix.  Gara Petothal was an Imperial Intelligence officer in the previous X-Wing book.  Now disguised as a victim of Imperial exploitation and under the identity of Lara Notsil, she has joined Wraith Squadron, confused as to where her loyalties lie: with her squad mates who trust her or with the Imperials who trained her.  Wedge Antilles continues to develop into a stronger character, but what is most impressive is Allston's portrayal of Han Solo.  Rather than Solo the rogue and smuggler or even family man from previous books, Allston presents General Solo.  Here he is a soldier and tactician, a commander, not just a man with a blaster about to kill the enemies personally.  Allston also does a great job with his villains.  Both Zinj and Melvar come to life in an interesting way.  Unlike other Imperial soldiers, Zinj is not a great tactician like Thrawn, nor is he a force-wielder like Vader and the Emperor, nor is he insane like Isard.  Instead he is a soldier who understands the importance of manipulation and subterfuge as well as knowing when to fight and when to retreat.  Overall, Iron Fist is an entertaining and well-written Star Wars book.  It goes above and beyond the call of duty.	2004-02-25

Based on the continuing hunt for Warlord Zinj, General Solo along with Commander Antilles and his loyal pilots continue to show off their skills in ways that make this a fun and exciting read.  The Lara Notsil/Gara Petothal issue is resolved in a way that is both satisfying and leaves the reader wanting more, perhaps an opening for another X-Wing book.  Anyway, the main story sees the defeat of Zinj, although not permanentaly as well as some of best action in the expanded universe.  With this trilogy, Allston gave us memorable characters including Face, Donos, Elesser, Tyra and others, but he fleshed out those that already existed especially Melvar and Zinj two bad guys who hardly get mentioned in the book where they play such a big role (The Courtship of Princess Leia) as well as giving Han Solo a chance to be a general.  That was one of the best developments in this series.  Allston contributed excellently to the X-Wing series.  He also wrote one more X-Wing book as well as two of the better New Jedi Order books.  He is really an excellent contributer to the Star Wars universe.	2004-02-25

Wraith Squadron was the first Star Wars book written by Aaron Allston and the first to feature an all new X-Wing squadron.  Featuring a more focussed role on Wedge Anitlles, Wraith Squadron picks up right where the Bacta War left off.  Instead of searching for elite pilots, Antilles wants a bunch of already trained screw ups to fight under his command.  From a failed Jedi to a mechanic who gets stage fright to a former child star, these characters are both unique and hysterical.  Wraith Squadron is among the freshest of the Star Wars books.

The Bacta War was the first X-Wing novel I ever read.  It's dynamic storytelling hooked me right away even though I didn't know all the history of the previous 3 books.  Stackpole is at his best mixing up space dogfights with brutal firefights and large scale planetary conquest.  Yet for all its grandeur, this story is an intimate one.  The moment when Corran Horn meets his girlfriends father is hysterical yet at the same time totally believable.  This is Star Wars on a new level.  The characters introduced and continued in the first 3 novels come alive with a vividness that is startling.  The villain is totally evil and because of the way Stackpole played in the treachery of a Rogue, the story takes on a more personal note for the reader.  They identify more with the renegade Rogues, creating a tense and sweeping space yarn.  I highly recommend it.	2004-02-20

Curuscant has been freed from the Empire, but Intel. Director Isard left behind a devastating plague that only affects non-humans.  The Rogue Squadron spy has been caught and is on trial for the murder of Corran Horn, supposedly killed at the end of the second book in the series.  Yet information is still getting to the Imperials, even with Tycho Celchu in custody.  With Bacta as the only form of medicine to cure the plague in short supply, the Republic has been dealt a hammer blow.  But hope could return in the form of some savy smugglers, as well as the captured and imprisoned Corran Horn.  While his friends mourned his death, he was being tortured by Isard in her cruelest dungeon Lusankya.  Because of the diverse threads of the story, the action can get tedious but overall its a great effort, just not as good as the first 2.	2004-02-12

If the first book in the X-Wing series was great, then Wedge's Gamble, the second in the acclaimed X-Wing series was phenominal.  It took everything great about the first book and turned up the heat.  Wedge's Gamble, has WEdge Antilles and his Rogue Squadron on an impossible mission: disable the shields of Curuscant, the seat of Imperial Power.  They have to deal with rogue agents, unpleasant surprises, deadly enemies and a traitor or two in their midst.  Stackpole takes his characters and crafts a remarkable story.  As a stand alone book its very good as part of the X-Wing series its awesome.  Once again Stackpole focuses on Corran Horn a character who is not omnipotent, who does make mistakes, sometimes crucial ones. He is a very strict former cop who has the ego of an elite pilot just to make things interesting.  It's not just Horn who is well drawn but the other characters as well.  As the main villain Isard is chilling, but it's the hidden agenda of Fliry Vorru that hinges the story.  Full of laserfights, space battles and one really big storm, Wedge's Gamble is a superb addition to the X-Wing series and the expanded universe.	2004-02-11

In the late 1990's with interest fading in the Star Wars universe with generic and repetative characters and stories, Bantam Books came out with a fresh new look at the Star Wars universe.  They took one of the side characters in the original Star Wars Trilogy and turned in one of the greatest maxi-series in the expanded universe.  Rogue Squadron, founded by Luke Skywalker and seconded by Wedge Antilles is the focus of the X-Wing series' first 4 books.  With Luke being all Jedi, Antilles receives command of the squadron, and some time after Return of the Jedi begins to reorganize it to become one of the most feared weapons of the New Republic.  To do so he recruits the best pilots in the galaxy, among them is Corran Horn, ex-law enforcement officer from Corellia and the total antithesis of Han Solo.  What makes this series so good is the excellent writing of Michael Stackpole perhaps the second best writer in the expanded universe.  His character development is excellent, he makes you care for both the story and people in it.  His villains actually have some feeling of threat to them unlike other books.  Rogue Squadron is an excellent start to the X-Wing series.	2004-02-10

Another Great story from the best Star Wars Writer ever	Tim Zahn returns of the Star Wars universe with a bang.  Survivor's Quest follows the adventures of Luke &amp; Mara Jade Skywalker several months after their marriage.  This books is vagualy along the lines of Tatooine Ghost by Troy Denning which took place a  few months after Han &amp; Leia were married.  In many ways, it is the completion of Zahn's Hand of Thrawn series.  The Chiss major players in the recently concluded New Jedi Order series, and the native race of the greatest tactician in Star Wars history, Grand Admiral Thrawn, take center stage as does the Outbound Flight project brought up in Zahn's very first Star Wars series.  Luke &amp; Mara are contacted by the Chiss who discovered the remains of the OUtbound Flight project, a fleet of 6 massive ships supposedly destroyed by Thrawn 50+ years ago.  Along for the ride are Chiss with hidden agenda's, con men, alien worshippers, intrigue &amp; deception.  The book is a taut thriller, full of twists and turns and focuses on Luke &amp; Mara, none of the other mainline Star Wars characters make an appearance except for Talon Karrde &amp; Booster Terrik.  This works to the books advantage, because many times with so many characters, storylines get too conflicted.  Overall this is a great and fun look at the Skywalkers as a couple and helps to answer many questions posed by revelations from the prequal movies.  Just as Tatooine Ghost did, Survivor's Quest incorporates information found in both The Phantom Menace &amp; Attack of the Clones to form a more complete Star Wars novel.  Is it better than Zahn's other work?  Not better than his original Thrawn trilogy, but certainly equal to his Hand of Thrawn series.  And that ladies &amp; gent's is not too bad!	2004-02-07

Sure Luceno wrote the very good Prequal Era book: Cloak of Deception but he had also written two of the not so good entries into the New Jedi Order Series the Agents of Chaos books.  I needn't have worried.  Luceno's final entry into thet NJO series The Unifying Force is an excellent Star Wars book and a fitting conclusion to the New Jedi Order series.  Almost all of our old Star Wars friends make some sort of impact in the story.  While some of the twists and turns are more predictable, overall this book is a top-notch effort.  The biggest criticism I have, is that perhaps this book might have been better expanded into 2.  The conclusion at the end leaves something to be desired, but overall the book is extremely well written, although it downplays some of the more romantic elements in previous books and ignores some important information from Keyes Final Prophecy about Tahiri and Corran Horn.  Overall I find very little to critisize as I write my final New Jedi Order review.  From outrageously excellent books like Star by Star to the not so good like the Force Heretic series, its been one hell of a ride.	2003-11-16

OUr heroes, on the run from assasins after Leia's unborn twins, as well as Luke and Leia themselves, run through the book at a frantic pace.  Leia decides that the best place to hide is amongst the enemy, so along with Chewbacca she embarks on a quest to the world of Honogar, the homeworld of the Empire's best assasins.  Luke after spending time with the insane Dark Jedi C'Boath is off on a mission to rescue smuggler chief Talon Karrde from Grand Admiral Thrawn's personal Star Destroyer with the help of Mara Jade, who wants to kill him once the rescue is complete.  Han Solo finds himself swept off to a secret meeting with a soldier who may or may not help the fragile New Republic against  the victorious Empire and Thrawn.  Added to this is a frantic race to discover the location of the Katana Fleet or Dark Force.  A mysterious fleet of warships designed after the Clone Wars that could tip the victory in the laps of those who find it first.  Add in political intrigue, an Alliance commander accused of treason and clones and you have one heck of a good novel.	2003-10-18

The Last Command is the final book in Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy.  The New Republic has been struck hard by the master warlord Thrawn, but now they face a war on 2 fronts.  Dark Jedi C'Boath, with visions of himself as Emperor, has arisen to challenge Thrawn and seduce Luke Skywalker to his side.  As Leia gives birth to Jedi twins, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian and Luke Skywalker follow Mara Jade, former Emperor's Hand on a quest to destroy Thrawn's cloning facilities.  It is a journey fraught with peril as that will only end when first Mara defeats Skywalker in a dual to the death and stands against C'Boath.  Filled with powerful prose, roaring action sequences, humor and fun, The Last Command is the perfect ending to the Thrawn Trilogy.  It also perfectly sets up these characters for ensuing books, although lesser talents served to make hash out of them.  Enjoyable and eminantely readable, The Last Command is an excellent addition to any fiction collection.	2003-10-18

I first read Heir to the Empire when it was released.  Since that book I have been enchanted with a universe long ago and far away.  Really it was the Zahn books more than the orignal movie trilogy that made me into a Star Wars fan.  I have read and reviewed every book in the expanded universe from the exellent Zahn, Stackpole, Keyes &amp; Denning to the horrible Anderson, Kube-McDowell, Hambly &amp; McIntyre.  Heir to the Empire is the book that began all that troublesome mixture of continuity that is called the expanded universe.  Zahn is first and foremost and excellent writer.  He has a firm grasp of his characters, and uses the movies as a springboard rather than a crutch.  In Heir to the Empire Zahn introduces 4 of the best characters in the Star Wars universe: Talon Karrde, smuggler chief extraordinaire a smuggler, who unlike Han Solo is in it for the money and understands the importance of information, Mara Jade sometime Jedi and personal assassin to the Emperor with a mad on for Luke Skywalker, Borsk Fey'la a crafty and ruthless Bothan politician whose treads just on the right side of good in his quest for personal power and the most deadly superweapon ever produced by the Empire: Grand Admiral Thrawn a man as deadly as he competant.  A soldier whose ulitmate goal is not destruction but the reunification of the Empire.  Karrde, Jade and Fey'la continue to be featured right through the current New Jedi Order series, a testament to their popularity and origins.  While Thrawn has never returned after the events of this Trilogy, his ghost remains floating in the background of many of the recent Star Wars novels. Our old friends have also changed a bit Han Solo still a risk taker but married to a now pregnant Princess Leia burdoned by politics but well on her way to becoming a Jedi and Luke Skywalker, not the brooding, depressed hero of later novels, but full of life yet NOT invincible.  All in all Heir to the Empire is an excellent beginning to one of the greatest sci-fi literary achievements, as its run as a New York Times Bestseller is a testament of.	2003-10-17

The back story and inclusion of scenes not from the movie add a more complete understanding to the reader.  Anakin far from being a whining spoiled brat seems much more likable and self-depracating, a view NOT given in the movie.  Overall, though its just a standard adaption and I am not a big fan of Salvatore's writing style.  Unlike Brooks, who wrote the Episode I adaption, he is very uninspiring and not the least dynamic.  Overall, it is a superior adaption to most books that are written nowadays.	2003-10-15

When I heard that Greg Keyes would be returning to write the second to last book in the New Jedi Order series, I was thrilled.  First his two original NJO books rate among the best in the series, and his grasp of the characters was incredibly complete.  Second, we finally get to have almost an entire book dedicated to Tahiri, just as Dark Journey was dedicated to Jaina and TRaitor was dedicated to Jacen, The Final Prophecy is dedicated mostly to Tahiri although large chunks of the book deal with other heroes, including Corran Horn, back in action after he was ignored in previous books and Wedge Antilles who returns to prominance after a long lay off.  The storyline involving the Shamed Ones and Nom Anor continues and the sentient planet Zonoma Sekot plays a crucial role in the story.  After the disppointing Force Heretic Trilogy, Keyes returns with a action packed story that does not get lost in itself.  His grasp of the characters remains firm, while he treads new ground with them.  Tahiri continues to evolve after the events of Force Heretic III.  FH3 portrayed a reunited Tahiri as a consummate warrior above doubts, and in many ways that was the wrong way to go.  Keyes shows just how difficult it is for the new Tahiri to function, while at the same time pairing her with Corran Horn and Nem Yim, two of the most influential people in the previous Keyes books brings back an air of familiarity to the character.  Nom Anor stays true to form, but the evolution of the Vong priest Harrar was a welcome addition.  As great as The Final Prophecy is, there are some downsides.  The story sometimes focuses too much on the Vong to the detriment of the military action taking place with Antilles and the continuing evoltion of Tahiri.  Another character, Danni Quee, who deserves the award for most useless in this series is not even mentioned neither is her relationship? with Jacen.  Rather, it almost seems that Jacen and Tahiri are meant to be together, although I might be readingtoo much into a brief encounter the two characters have.  As the NJO roars to its conclucion, Keyes makes a steller and well above average contribution to the series.  Of all the authors who have written for the NJO so far, his books have been among the most dynamic and most interesting.  This is the 17th review I have written for the NJO series, and while this books is not one of the top 5, it certainly rests in the top 10.	2003-10-14

Episode I had many problems, poor script, poor actors and indifferent direction, but the novel by Terry Brooks was definately a highlight for the movie.  A strong adaption of the Lucas screenplay, Brooks gives stunning insight into the world of the Star Wars prequal.  His writing about the Sith and about a young Anakin give the reader a much better grasp of the story while providing a dynamic setting.  Overall, it's a top notch effort and well worth the readers time.  I would like to see Brooks write in the regular expanded universe some time soon.	2003-10-14

Picking up directly after the Hutt Gambit, Rebel Dawn suffers in comparison to its well-written predecessors.  The book is much more predictable and the return of characters followed throughout the trilogy is a give.  Bria, Han's love from the first book is reunited with the scruffy smuggler, only to betray him for the Rebel Alliance.  Han loses all his friends except Chewie, but in the meantime is able to make the fastest Kessel Run ever, loses spice from Jabba and generally gets set up for plot points that take place in the classic trilogy.  Although it is an above average Star Wars book, Rebel Dawn is a bit of a letdown after the previous 2 books, but is still an adequate conclusion to the Han Solo trilogy.	2003-10-11

Their legendary partnership begins with a drunk Han Solo and takes them all the way across the galaxy, with Han meeting all sorts of movie and expanded universe characters including Shalla, Lando Calrissian and of course everyonr's favorite bounty hunter: Boba Fett.  The confronatation between Solo and Fett is classic and really amazing.  Crispin continues to write perfectly for this character.

The rogue with the heart of gold is epitomized in Star Wars' Han Solo.  Supposedly in it for the money, he helps save the day and joins the Rebellion.  Now here is his story.  Crispin writes a terrific adventure yarn, fleshing out a young Han Solo and making him believable as a character and giving him perhaps the best and most complete origin story in the Star Wars universe.  This story begins with a teenage Han Solo escaping from his home/prison on a wandering ship run by a bad-hearted version of Fagan from Oliver Twist.  Solo is more like the Artful Dodger and less like Oliver.  He escapes makes his own way in the world, meets a woman who might become the love of his life and at the end of the story joins the Imperial Academy.  The evolution of the character is readily apparant, as he is loyal to his friends, an excellent pilot and at times a hero though usually on the wring side of the law.  Anway this first book in Crispins series is by far the best of the 3 and truly brings Han Solo to life.	2003-09-13

It's exciting with interesting characters, well-written movie tie-ins and overall simply a fun read.     The interaction between Obi-wan and Qui-Gon is very well done as is the continuing introduction of Vergere.  The story revolves around a comment made in Episode I when Senator Palpatine refers to the Chancellor as being engulfed by \\"baseless accusations of corruption\\", this story tells how these accusations came to pass, as well as the simultaneous story of how Nute Gunray came to power.  Its filled with Jedi in the role of protectors, not as private investigators as seen in Rogue Planet or as diplomats as seen in The Approaching Storm.  Here they are the guardians of peace and justice for the Republic.    Luceno writes in a very different style from his New Jedi Order books, and it gives me hope for his next Star Wars work.	2003-09-06

Luke and Leia are off on a diplomatic mission which explains the absence of Han Solo, not known to be a returning character by the author, and they are forced to crash land on a swampy planet that ironically resembles Dagobah.  Here they stumble across a hidden Imperial installation, are captured, escape and have to go after a mysterious Force enhancing crystal.  On the way they fight locals, Imperials and Darth Vader as well as monsters and their environs.  The relationship between Luke and Leia seems to be heading in a more romantic direction than a brother/sister relationship should really go, but then again, in Empire, Leia tries to suck off Luke's face so really it just enhances the sibling surprise.  The confrontation with Darth Vader is one of the highlights of the book.  Especially the part when Luke is trapped and Leia faces off against the Dark Lord with a lightsaber.  Here Vader is at his most evil playing with his prey before pouncing.  He tortures Leia with his lightsaber conveying a brutality not seen in him before.  The fight between Luke and Vader is also very good and if it differs from Star Wars canon a little how cares!  It's still a well written scene.  Splinter of the Mind's Eye is among the best of the Star Wars books written and it is indeed Foster's best Star Wars novel.  I highly recommend it to the thinking Star Wars reader.	2003-09-06

The first way is the most common, as a stand alone story taking place after Episode I where we slowly start to see Anakin Skywalker descend into the dark side.  In a very slow and tedious way.  Or the book can be viewed as a prequal to the New Jedi Order series.  In this viewpoint, Rogue Planet comes off very well.  It introduces Vergere and really helps the reader to understand why Sekot could be important 40 or 50 years after Rogue Planet takes place.  The relationship between Anakin and Obi-wan is inconsistantly written.  There are times when Bear seems to get lost in his story and forget how is characters act.  OVerall, the first time I read Rogue Planet I found it filled with unnecessary characters, overblown dialogue and pointless plot.  Now, when I view the book in light of the NJO series I find that many of the characters are still unnecessary and the dialogue is still overblown but some major plot points now make sense, something very important when you are reading a book.  Yet, this book for all its relevance to the NJO series is still a slightly above average addition to the Star Wars Saga.	2003-09-06

Set on a backwater planet, The Approaching Storm is supposed to prepare the way for Episode II.  It does to a certain extent although it downplays dark side of Anakins personality and relies on some predictable characters to move the story along.  The setting was unique.  In a universe filled with seedy space ports, seeing our Jedi ride herd animals and waltz over a savannah was a nice change of pace.  The interation between the 4 Jedi was very well done.  The original points of the story helped to make The Approaching Storm a very readable book.  As for the bad, the villain is a hut of course with a tie in to Episode II villain Darth Tyrannus.  The worst part of the story, is that Foster invents his own Gungan type characater in the person of Tooqui ( I know I spelled that wrong).  This character generally causes mischief but by the end of the day, saves our heroes.  He is not really needed.  Overall, though I applud Foster's return to a galaxy far far away and hope that he consents to write another story for lucasbooks	2003-09-06

Shadow Hunter brings to life everyone's favorite painted Sith Lord Darth Maul.  Yet even though the story is about Darth Maul, the side characters are actually a bit more interesting and steal much of the spotlight from the Episode I baddie.  The young Jedi apprentice and her master along with an embittered information broker make this story very fast paced and entertaining.  Our Jedi heroes fight hard to save a man with information about the impending Naboo blockade while Obi-Wan Kenobi makes an extended cameo.  At times, Darth Maul is regulated to side story status, something that is a bit puzzling since the story is about him.  If you want some fun reading filled with spectacular fight scenes and short on originality, this books for you.  It is a fine Star Wars book, but simply not original enough to be considered anything more than above average.	2003-09-06

The story really takes off and the action keeps the reader moving through the story at a good pace.  All our heroes are in their prime ready to once again defeat the galaxy's evil.  The biggest problem with this book is the ambiguity of the bod guys.  Han Solo's cousin is just a front, and tis Triad are the real baddies but not much is really known or said about them.  The author just kind of leaves them hangin so to speak.  My other criticism deals with Anaking who is way to babyish in the beginnin gof the book and simply too sophisticated in the conclusion.  OVerall however, this is a above average trilogy in the Star Wars universe.	2003-08-10

It was great to see the return of Bakura to the Star Wars universe after a decently long time of neglect.  The scenes with Luke and Lando are enthralling while other scenes show some flashes of brilliance, but overall this book is simply better than average.  It suffers through a sophmore slump, parts of the book are just uninteresting.  The writing stays fine, but the especially the scenes with Han Solo and his allies prove to be a bit drawn out and difficult to read.  That said, Assualt at Selonia is still better than any of the KJ Anderson books in the Star Wars universe.  It builds up very well towards the conclusion Showdown at Centerpoint.	2003-08-10

After beginning so strongly with Force Heretic I, the next two books failed to live up to my expectations.  Force Heretic III does rebound from the rather predictable middle volume in this trilogy.  As with the other two books, this book reads very quickly, the action is fast paced and exciting.  Yet the story is too predictable.  The biggest downside was the discovery of Sekot, and mythical planet that seemed to have been found with a minimum amount of work by Luke and his crew.  The seens with Sekot also failed to live up to expectations.  In contrast, the scenes with Han, Leia and Jaina more than made up for the deficiencies of the Sekot crew.  Their portion of the story was fast paced and very enjoyable and it is from this part of the story that I give this book a 4 star rating.  The NJO writers also need to decided what they are going to do with Danni Quee, she just seems to float around without any development or point to her existance.  The Tahiri problem seems to have been solved and I am really looking forward to the next book in the series, for it deals with her.  One question I do have is this: Who was the Force Heretic?  Nothing any of the Jedi did seemed all that out of the ordinary for Jedi.  The title of the series really did not make sense.  Overall this series gets a 3.5 across the board.  The excellence of the first book almost makes up for the problems of the next two.  Really this book deserves 2.5 stars but as that is not allowed I'll give it 3.	2003-08-06

It deals with the return of Han Solo to his home Corellian system after decades of exile. Allen has a decent grasp of the characters and he writes the Solo children very well.  The plot all about exploding stars and solar system wide planetary blackouts is a little hard to take seriously, but overall the story is very well-written.  Han Solo is the same rascal often portrayed in previous books, but his more serious, fatherly side does come out strongly in this book.  Luke has lost the brooding quality that plagued him in pretty much every book after the Zahn trilogy making his character much more interesting and entertaining.  Leia after several books dealing with her being the chief of state still has government work to do, but Allen takes a better more personal approach to her.  The Solo mistrust of Mara Jade is out of character, but two memorable scenes really make this a good book:<BR>1.  Mon Mothma telling Luke off and his subsaquent preentation of a lightsaber to Leia telling her that she too is a trained Jedi and their subsaquent dual. (The New Jedi Order seems to have overlooked this point).  The second is the much more memorable incident early in the book where we see that Han Solo is still the same person with his attack of a better armed probe droid.  OVerall this book is a better than average star wars book, and while not the best of the trilogy is certainly a great start.	2003-07-02

Instead of the rogue Imperial warlords etc, the New Republic is forced to deal with a terroristic attack aimed at the heart of its government.  Rusch does a nice job of writing the classic characters ridding Luke of some of the brooding oppresiveness that had characterized him in previous books, keeping Han Solo in his devil may care attitude while exploring a bit more of his background.  Leia is probably the worst written until she takes off to confront the Dark Jedi behind the terroristic threat.  Then she reverts to form as a tough warrior princess. I'm beginning to believe that making Leia the Chief of State was perhaps the worst idea ever in the expanded universe, but Rusch does a good job in what has become a more standard plotline involving Leia.  The only problem with this book is the plotline involving the droids and a mechanic is not really necessary.  Anyway overall, this was a solid Star Wars book and among the top books of the series.	2003-06-30

Han finally gets something to do, but due to the ineptness of the New Republic military (can't imagine how they beat the Empire at all) by the evil, is captured by bigoted Yevetha nazi beings introduced in the first book.  Chewie has a subplot involving his son's journey into manhood, while Lando's adventure on the ghost ship is really painful to read.  This series could have been so much better but a convoluted plot, poor editing and really awful writing make it among te worst set of books in the Star Wars universe.	2003-06-19

The one word that characterizes all the books of the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy? BORING!!!!!!!!!!  The book moves too slowly and is simply too inconsistant.  Luke Skywalker runs off to become a hermit at Darth Vader's old retreat rejecting his Academy, his family and pretty everything else.  Only a mysterious woman who is able to enter his stronghold induces Luke to leave with promises about his lost mother.  Leia is shown much more as the Chief of State, an idea that did have merit, while Han Solo is shown more as the family man.  The problem is, is that the story moves so slowly.  The characterizations are weak: Princess Leia, the people's leader refuses to learn the names of her bodyguards preferring to ignore their existance.  That is totally contrary to Princess Leia, Han Solo is done all right but that is because he really has nothing to do.  Luke is done terribly.  The Black Fleet crisis marks the epitome of stupid Jedi power Luke.  It took Zahn coming back into the fold to save the expanded universe after the Black Fleet Debacle.  The Lando adventure has possibilities but it too drops by the wayside due to just too much non-sensical writing.  Perhaps this story should have been a one or two book set not a trilogy, at time it feels like the auther was just trying to fill space.  In any event, this book needed some major editing and marked a dark period of Star Wars literature that not even the Jedi Academy Trilogy (horrible as it was)reached.	2003-06-19

The characterizations of Luke and Leia remain poor, Lando's mission is still annoying but there is a bright spot. Chewie's rescue of Han Solo is one of the few bright points in this trilogy.  The daring and insane rescue of a battered and tortured Han Solo by his best friend is truly a memorable scene in an otherwise forgettable book.  Chewie becomes much more than just a hairy sidekick, but rather he is more of a brother to Han than Luke is, as Han points out when he is brought back to a medical ship where Luke happens to have just landed.  Luke and the strange woman continue to search for her people and his mother training.  They finally track down this secretive people, but unknown to Luke (but known to everyone else), his traveling companion lied to him and his mother was really not a part of the secret society, yet Luke can still learn how to use their powers with only like 2 hours of training..  A slave revolt against the evil Yevetha helps to end the threat to the New Republic and Leia sits triumphant atop the backstabbing political world.  The end has Luke and Leia reconciling (from a separation that was totally unnecessary) and Luke returns to his real living family.  As for Lando, Luke also took time out of his busy schedule to hop halfway across the galaxy to save his old friend trapped aboard a living ship/seedpod.  Sounds kind of Vongish to me.  Anyway the Black Fleet Crisis Trilogy is one of the worst in the Star Wars universe.  All three books filled with annoying convoluted plot and terrible depictions of the main characters.  It simply the worst trilogy of the Star Wars universe, which is saying something considering how bad the Jedi Academy Trilogy is.  Kube-McDowell should have spent more time writing and editing his book to be much more streamlined than the clunky and poorly written result that Star Wars fans received.  Words cannot describe the awfulness of this series.	2003-06-19

Luke injured by the Emperor during the final battle aboard the Death Star II, is receiving treatment for those life threatening electrical convulsions you see him go through, when he receives a visitation from the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi bidding him to go to Bakura which is in great danger.  So Luke in command of a task force with diplomats Han and Leia in tow heads out to Bakura.  It was interesting to see Luke Skywalker in command of a military force, something not seen in any of the other Star Wars books.  At Bakura our heroes find Imperial forces about to be destroyed by soul sucking aliens.  In the interests of the innocents enemies join force and the fun begins.  The battles both on land and in space are well written and the story is great.  Love, death, betrayel, everything a Star Wars reader could possibly want is here.  Han's gloating over the defeat of the Empire at Endor in front of Bakura's Imperial governor is classic, Leia's confrontation with the spirit of Anakin Skywalker is an imporatant aspect to the story, while Luke's romantic feelings for a lovely Bakuran senator are a humanizing influence on a character to often viewed as above human emotions.  Overall Truce at Bakura is a great read, well written and I highly recommend it.	2003-06-18

While not as complex as the Zahn books or the Stackpole books, it is a strong story with an interesting concept.  One assumes that Han and Leia will be together happily ever after at the end of Return of the Jedi, but what if there were some bumps in the road on the way to happy marriage?  Wolverton explores this path, by having a rival for Han Solo show up.  Now normally Han Solo would just laugh at a rival, but this guy seems just too perfect for Leia.  Han and Leia argue and seem to break up.  In desperation, Han kidnaps Leia and takes to to a planet won in a card game that happens to be in the territory of an Imperial Warlord who hates General Solo personally.  Luke and the jilted suitor followeventually everyone is shot down on this planet which is inhabited by force powerful \\"witches\\" who are engaged in a battle between light and dark.  This book, while it might not have alot of depth, is just alot of fun to read.  The new characters the Prince of Hapes and Tenneil Djo are a great addition to the expanded universe.  It is unfortunate that it is not until the Young Jedi Knights series that these characters are in any way used again.  Overall I have to say this is a fun, enjoyable and recommended Star Wars book.	2003-06-18

This book is the worst of the subpar and ouright terrible Jedi Academy Trilogy.  Middle books usually tend to lag, and this definately lags.  The story was terrible to begin with and just drones on and on.  I get bored just writing about it.  I have read every Star Wars book ever written so I do have a grip on what makes a good Star Wars book and Dark Apprentice is just terrible.  Anderson has no coherrant plot, his characters are way too powerful and really his writing style is juvenile.  In about 6 days Kyp Durron (aka Luke if he had met a 4,000 yar old dead Sith master) is able to learn more about the Force and in another 6 defeats Luke Skywalker, last Jedi Master?  Come on!  It took Stackpole's I, Jedi just to make this trilogy work.  The story has so many plot holes that it is amazing the book is solid.  Overall a terrible effort and the worst of a terrible series.	2003-06-18

Shatterpoint had the makings of greatness, the coolest Jedi in the Temple: Mace Windu, on his own mission against the Separatists, to the place where he was born.  Instead, there are some really cool moments overshadowed by too much philosophical discussion and outright confusion.  At times the action is totally intense and at others it's very difficult to follow what is actually happening.  Half the story is told from Windu's 1st person POV in the guise of entries into his journal, the other is in the traditional 3rd person POV.  This constant switching makes the story difficult to follow and leaves the reader unsure of where everything is actually going.  This can be a good thing at times because the twists and turns are unexpected, but the philosophy discussed during the story seems to be more appropriate to the New Jedi Order than to a Clone Wars novel.  The Jedi know the difference between light and dark, that information has not been lost or deluded and still Windu and his fellow Jedi seem to struggle with this concept.  The biggest problem is with Mace Windu himself.  The biggest problem that an author faces when writing about some really cool established character is that you  have to delve into the characters psyche and inevitably the readers view of the character changes.  This is the reason that there has never been a successfuly story about Boba Fett or Darth Maul.  The picture of Windu changes during the course of the story due to the constant barrage of philosophy and theology and not enough concrete story.  At times Windu seems totally out of touch with how the world works, and while the Jedi were isolated they did have a clue about the real world.  The other problem I have is with the idea of the &quot;dark jungle&quot; (when you read it you will know what I mean).  I find this whole concept and the character that embodies it to be really annoying and almost totally unnecessary.  The story itself has some moments that are truly cool and very well done, but then there are moments when you simply want to put that book down and stop reading it.  Better editing and really a better storyline elimination of extraneous information probably would have made this story more than just a slightly better than average Star Wars novel.	2003-06-09

Champions of the Force is interesting to a point.  There are some space battles that seem to be ok, but the major problems haunting all of Anderson's Star Wars books persist.  Another superweapon enters the picture: Death Star prototype, run by beings who are so inept its supposed to be funny but comes off just annoying.  Kyp Durron returns to the light side, and Exar Khun is defeated but by the end of the story, Durron is treated like buddy not a mass murderer.  It's simply not realistic.    Admiral Daala comes back to provide Imperial presence but it's not really needed.  Anderson tries but the book is to predictable and simply not all that good.  Useless characters and plot lines abound.  Really enough is enough.  If you wish to read about the opening of the Jedi Academy pick up I, Jedi not this trilogy.	2003-06-05

I happen to be on a project reviewing all the Star Wars book that have come out and since I have read and own all of them, I reread them in anticipation of these reviews.  The first book in the Jedi Academy Trilogy is not the worst of the series, but it is poor and simply put it gets worse with every read.  I was in junior high when I first read this book and it did not seem too bad, but now I review it as a college graduate and it's simply terrible.  Wedge Antilles piloting a contruction droid instead of a starfighter?  Ok perhaps Wedge needed some time off but come on.  Lando Calrissian reduced to poverty? No.  Princess Leia, who was quite advance in her Jedi training during the Thrawn Trilogy is now a barely compatent apprentice.  I mean the characterizations of the classic characters are all out of whack (technical term).  Useless characters are constantly being introduced: Admiral Daala, the most incompatent Imperial officer ever written.  She was supposed to be a feared tactician but all she looks like is totally pathetic commander.  Gantoris and the whole \\"dark man\\" idea, just a little bit predictable.  Kyp Durron, the Luke Skywalker clone.  While Durron has evolved into a solid character in the New Jedi Order books, most Star Wars authors for the pre-NJO simply avoid him because he is a poor character.  Qui Xu, why have her?  A scientist who invented the Death Star didn't know what it was used for?  Ok brainwashing is understandable to a point but come on.  Then Wedge has to fall in love with her, yeah makes perfect sense; and last but not least, another superweapon.  One as big as an X-Wing and more powerful than the Death Star: The Sun Crusher.  Bad name, bad idea, simply a bad story.  Book 2 is even worse, before book 3 comes back a little	2003-06-04

It's simply a magnificent read, one level with Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy.  I, Jedi is the first and only Star Wars novel written in the first person and follows the character Corran Horn from the X-Wing series.  Almost al the other beloved Star Wars characters are featured in the story but not as the main characters.  This gives the book a very refreshing slant.  Stackpole also improves upon Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy, fleshing out plot and fixing inconsistancies etc.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, and I simply cannot praise it enough.  It is really a incredible creation.	2003-06-04

Planet of the Twilight is the third book in the so-called Callista Trilogy, and the second Star Wars book by author Barbara Hambly.  It is the best of the Trilogy.  Hambly's previous work Children of the Jedi was repetative, convoluted and boring.  While her writing and plot still tend to be convoluted and Han Solo plays a very minor role (in the great scheme of things), Hambly brings a fresh idea to the Star Wars universe: that of an inter-galactic plague.  The whole Droch/Black Seed plague idea was really inspired.  In many ways this is the horror story of the Star Wars universe, very different from the previous five books which featured super-weapons like the sun-crusher, Death Star prototype, Eye of Palpatine and Darksaber.  Disease is a different type of weapon and the only credible way for Chief of State Leia to be kidnapped with all her bodyguards etc around is to have them die of the plague.  The story revolves around Luke and Leia with special emphasis on Leia.  It was nice to see her in a credible fighting role, and to see her powers expand.  Luke is still looking for Callista, but he seems to have gained back a measure of common sense and competence.  Their were two other really great things  in this book: 1) the relative absence of Callista, 2) the writing away of Admiral Daala.  I never liked Callista, i thought she was a useless character and really had no business being in the Star Wars universe.  Everything about her rubbed me the wrong way.  As for Admiral Daala it was good to see the most inept Imperial commander ever be written out never to bother the reader again.  She just fades away never to return (I hope).  Having read pretty much every Star Wars book in existance from the X-Wing books, the 5 Zahn books, the Corellian Trilogy, the Black Fleet Trilogy, the Jedi Academy Trilogy, the Prequal era books, the New Jedi Order and pretty ,uch everything else, the Callsita Trilogy is one of the weakest written.  PLanet of the Twilight is the best of that trilogy, but it is not one of the best Star Wars books.  The plot ideas are interesting, but simply put, I think Hambly has a poor writing style and she simply does not write a very exceptional Star Wars tale.  I do recommend PLanet of the Twilight to any Star Wars fan, but remember there are many, many better books out there.	2003-05-23

Children of the Jedi, the first book of the Callista Trilogy, has some intriguing qualities to it, but overall this book is too weak, repetative and convoluted to be considered good.  I would give it 1.5 stars if possible, but its not so one will have to do.  Yet another superweapon comes into being, the super-automated ship, Eye of Palpatine, whose mission to destroy the children of the Jedi on Belsavis was stopped 30 years earlier by a young female Jedi.  Someone restarted the ship's programs, and its up to Luke Skywalker, who i accedentaly on board the vessel, to destroy the ship before it reaches the planet Belsavis where Han and Leia are currently vacationing/investigating.  The superweapon story just keeps being used over and over again. IT'S OLD GET OVER IT!  Luke and 2 student companions are investigating some random coordinates when they are shot down and captured by the Eye, a super-intelligent ship that does everything it possibly can to kill Skywalker and his friends, but can't tell the difference between alien species.  Um ok.  After an attack/warning by an old smuggler friend, Han Solo and Chief of State of the New Republic Leia Organa Solo (without escorts, bodyguards or anything) travel to Belsavis seeking out the mythical place where the children of the Jedi were hidden.  Right, like the Chief of State of a galactic republic can just wander around without a planet's population of guards orbiting her.  Um NO!  Luke gets hurt making his job that much more difficult, but to comfort him in his time of need the Jedi who originally stopped the Eye reappeares.  It seems Callista had jammed her spirit into the Eyes gun system and existed for the last 30 years by herself.  Right!  Han & Leia fight a former concubine/Emperor's Hand and her son, who has been implanted with a device that allows him to use the Force to control droids.  Menwhile, Luke & Callista fall in love, and eventually she is able to enter the vacated body of one of Luke's students and theycan live together except Callista has lost her force powers.  The Eye is destroyed and they all live happily until the next galactic crisis.  The biggest problem with this story is that the plot is too convoluted and confusing, the story makes little sense and the characters are written out of character.  There are some good lines, the Dr. Breen line was very funny, but overall this book is very poorly done.  It is probably the weakest of the Callista Trilogy, although all three books are among the weakest in the exapanded Star Wars universe.	2003-05-22

Perry writes an excellent story, perfectly capturing the personalities of all the best Star Wars characters. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie and the droids are all written magnificently. The inclusion of Dash Rendar as a more mercenary and sarcastic Han Solo is another strong addition to this book. The backstory involving the Death Star is great, although Xizor though craft and evil is not one of the best Star Wars villains. While its nice to see an enemy who has no force skills, Guri is the more interesting character from the Black Sun crime syndicate. It was also interesting to see the conflicting sides of Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker. The conflict between good and evil plays out on a smaller scale in this case, but that makes it no less intriguing. The little hints about the conncection between Luke and Leia make the story stronger, while the inclusion of Luke's flying skill in an X-Wing coupled with Vader's return to a TIE fighter make for an interesting parallel between father and son. Overall, Shadows of the Empire is among the top stories of the expanded Star Wars universe, an execellent read for any Star Wars fan.	2003-05-22

Kevin Anderson writes a decent if unoriginal story, using many of the same characters from his Jedi Academy Trilogy.  First the good: having the Hutts try to costruct a Death Star type weapon was a decent idea, the areas introducing some of the back story to Lemeslick, Tarkin and Ackbar were equally good and fun to read.  It was nice to see Leia as the Chief of State if only for a short time.  Unlike some other books, where Han and Leia are running around all over the place without guards, escorts or anything else essential to a chief of state, Anderson writes Leia as a leader of the Galactic Senate at some points.  At others, he reverts to form.  The death of Madine is handled very well, as is the return to Hoth and the one-armed Wampa.  The bad: Continuing a tradition of useless Star Wars characters, Anderson brings back Qui Xu as Wedge Antilles main squeeze, Admiral Daala, the most inept Imperial commander to grace the expanded universe also returns, and of course everyone's favorite dead Jedi inhabiting the body of one of Luke's former students also returns.  To think that Admiral Pelleon would at any point defer to Daala is outrageous.  She's a totally inept officer, but at least she is able to kill off the annoying Moffs.  Qui just does not need to be anywhere near the military.  She's a scientist with no memory, get rid of her.  Callista just never fit into the Star Wars universe.  Somewhere along the line, someone decided Luke needed a girlfriend and so she was invented.  Her only being able to use the Dark Side of the force is stupid, as is her continuing whining about her fate.  Luke Skywalker clone Kyp Durron also returns, now a full Jedi Knight.  Wow, he went from mass murderer to full Jedi in about a year, Luke needed to spend more time with him to move that fast.  Overall, Darksaber is an ok read.  There are many better Star Wars books out there and several that are worse.  There are somekey elements needed to understand the SW universe better such as the background of the Death Star, Tarkin etc., but there is just too much recycled material to make this a good story.	2003-05-18

This book is absolutely terrible. Having read every other Star Wars book ever written, I can speak with some authority on the subject. The characterizations are weak and the behavior of the main characters erratic. Leia hates Chewie because he failed to save her children, even though he took a terrible wound attempting to help them? Doesn't make much sense. The Waru villain is simply [weak], it's a vampire blob, and Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master, that Jedi who has fought pretty much every evil in the universe and won is tempted by the blob. Tempted to do what? and why? are two questions that the author never answers. The Empire Reborn angle is almost laughable in its ineptitude. The whole cutting off from the force idea is [weak], and speaking of erratic plotting, if Skywalker is so affected that he and the good Jedi almost die from the slow cutting off of the Force then why aren't the bad guys similarly affected?  Yeah, Hethrir can't kill someone when he wants and he can't turn on his lightsaber but other than that he and his minions remain basically unaffected.  Speaking of lightsabers, what's up with lightsabers that can only be turned on with the force?  It's an impractical and ludicrous idea.  The Han Solo/Luke Skywalker relationship is terribly handled, Luke and Han are more like uneasy allies than best friends.  Han Solo is done decently well, but overall this story should never have been published. I have never read anything else of McIntyre's, she might be a very good writer, but her talent does not show here. If you wish to read about the Star Wars universe, read Tim Zahn or Michael Stackpole not The Crystal Star.	2003-05-17

Although it one of the longer books in the series, it is a very quick read. The storylines are good if a bit predictable. One storyline follows Jacen Solo on his quest to find a mustical living planet. Along for the ride are Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade, Saba, and Danni Quee along with some Imperial Remnant troops. They fly into Chiss space where typical, if a bit predictable and subdued, Star Wars mayhem ensues. The second storyline follows Han, Leia, Jaina, Jag and Tahiri to Bakura where anti-Republic sentiment masks a deeper more malevolant plot. The third storyline deals with Nom Anor and his Jedi heracy. This was actually a very interesting Vong subplot, usually I just find those subplots annoying but hearing Nom Anor preach about the Jedi was quite interesting. There is not all that much action to sustain the story and Mara Jade and Han Solo get nothing more than bits parts to play, while Princess Leia only shines occasionaly. Danni's relationship with Jacen, which seemed to be moving forward seems stalled in this book. It was interesting to return to Bakura and to see Chiss space, and the subplot involving Tahiri jumps forward and one of the better parts of the story. Overall, this book is not as good as Force Heretic I. It is well-written, but misses something that the first book had. There is less of the witticism and humor that are contained in the best Star Wars books. This is a solid addition to the NJO series and sets up the third book in the trilogy rather nicely.	2003-05-12

Easily within the top 10	In his second full Star Wars novel, Denning tackles new territory.  Tatooine Ghost tells of the time right after Han and Leia's marriage, but before Zahn's classic trilogy.  Denning also has resources that none of the other pre-New Jedi Order authors had: Episodes I &amp; II.  He makes great use of these resources by having Leia discover more about Vader's origins and giving her a picture of of her father before he was Vader.  Denning perfectly captures the characteristics of Han and Leia.  Plus it is equally gratifying to see Chewbacca return to the expanded universe.  This is by far the best non-NJO Star Wars book to come out in this millenium.  I highly recommend it to all Star Wars fans, it is truly a great and exciting read.	2003-03-19

Following the events of NJO: Destiny's Way, the heroes of the Star Wars universe go on separate missions to find a way to keep pushing back the Vong invasion.  I will not go into great detail for those who have not read the book, but the basic storyline revolves around the Solo twins, Jag Fel, Tahira and their respective mission personel.  First I wish to state that I was a bit dubious about the Force Heretic trilogy. Destiny's Way did not reach my expectations for the series, but Force Heretic: Remnant pleasantly surprised me.  It is the longest of the soft cover NJO books, in fact, it's probably the second longest of all the NJO books, but its exceedingly well written.  Williams and Dix have a great grasp on the characters, and though the storyline moves quickly and is fluid, character development and emotion are not in any way compromised.  It was good to see characters like Jaina and Admiral Pelleon written true to their previous characteristics.  The Pelleon in Destiny's Way was a fat complacent old man, in Remnant, Pelleon has returned to the personality given to him by  Zahn's books.  In Destiny's Way, Jaina had taken on the characteristics of a cyborg which did not reflect the changes that had taken place within her during Allston's NJO books.  The NJO characters who seemed to have been growing stale in Destiny's Way are rejuvenated by Remnant.  It is a superior NJO book and clearly in the top five books of the series.  I would definitely recommend this book to any NJO fans, and I look forward to the next 2 installments of this trilogy.  The only complaint I have, is that important characters like Wedge Antilles, Lando Calrissia, Lowbacca and a few others do not show up in the pages of this book.  However, this is understandable because of the directions Williams and Dix are taking the NJO in.	2003-02-07

First the good: Williams writes a good story. All the classic Star Wars characters are back and there are many great leaps made in war against the Vong. He is able to write a very compact and fast moving story. He is able to continue many of the characterizations begun in Stover's Traitor and Allston's Enemy Lines books. The down sides of this book are few but very crucial 1. because of the length of the book, Williams is unable to create any sense of time passage. The entire story takes place over a period of about 3-6 months, but it reads like something taking place over a couple days. This has happened with several of the NJO books with the exception of the longest book Star by Star. The NJO Ylesia ebook actually takes place between chapters 20 and 21 in Destiny's Way. It is a crucial chapter and should have been included in this book. Because of the shortness, Williams is unable to create emotion at key moments, everything seems just a bit rushed even on the climax, which should have more of an emotional impact than it does. Destiny's Way is no Star by Star, but it is still a competantly written, fast paced story and a decent addition to the NJO series.	2002-10-08

NJO Traitor begins at the end of Star by Star.  In many ways, it is the companion story to NJO Dark Journey which told of what happened to Jaina following Anakin's death.  Jacen Solo was captured at the end of Star by Star and Traitor is his story.  Captured and tortured by the Vong, Jacen is thought dead by his family, but he is not dead, instead he becomes the focal point in a plot by the Vong Warmaster, the villainous Nom Anor and the mysterious Vergere to destroy the Jedi.  That is all that I will write about plot.  This book is well-written, and therefore easy to read.  It lays a solid foundation for the next several NJO books. Occasional Force doctrine stuff can be tedious, but the even those occasional blips of tediousness do not slow down the reader.  Which brings up my second complaint, this book is a little too short.  While the focus is all on Jacen, so there are no other characters which makes less of an overall story, at under 300 pages, Traitor is just a bit on short side.  But as I said its well written, and the information about Jacen is invaluable.  It also makes the reader much more interested in the NJO series.  I, for one, am now waiting anxiously for the next NJO book Destiny's Way to continue the reinvigorated NJO series.	2002-07-31

This book is ok.  It is much better then Agents of Chaos II.  The story however, revolves too much around Han Solo to the detriment of the other characters.  Yes, Han Solo was ignored on the 2 Stackpole books, but to have 2 books with the main focus just on him was not really needed.  The stories could have been told in one much more interesting book, than in two books that it is easy to skim through.  While it was nice to see some of the characters from the Han Solo books brought back, they really did not do much to enhance the story.  The addition of Droma, just made him into a Chewie clone.  It was uninspired.  I would much rather have seen Han working with Anakin than with Droma.  The subplot involving the Ving priestess and Vergere was interesting, but really only served to reintroduce Vergere to the Star Wars universe after the few times she was mentioned in Bear's Rogue Planet.  Thankfully, the disease that plagued Mara Jade is beginning to be wiped out, but Luceno ignores his more dynamic characters to settle in the stereotypical companions for Han.  That said, Hero's Trial is better than its sequal, but the two Agents of Chaos books are the 2 worst books in the NJO series.	2002-06-28

There is nothing original about it.  Han Solo continues to run around with the Chewie clone, and there is a small subplot involving Anakin and Jacen but overall, there is nothing original or exciting in the this novel.  There is simply to little going on to justify the amount of writing Luceno does for this story.  The only original idea in the entire story is the droid revolution that Han Solo gets involved in.  Jacen is portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat, while Anakin could have ended the whole NJO series with the flick of a button.  There is too much that doesn't add up, and too little of the other SW characters to make this book interesting at all.	2002-06-28

Many people have already written about the plotline for Onslaught, the second book in the NJO series.  I am going to concentrate on the book itself.  This is an average Stackpole Star Wars book.  It is not particularly good or bad, it is very entertaining but it is very predictable and not of the calibar of Stackpole's X-Wing books, I, Jedi, or even the second book to this mini-series Ruin.  The characterizations are bland, and there is not much character development.  You don't have to think very much when reading this book.  I have the biggest problem with  Stackpole's characterization of Kyp Durron which is &lt;excuse the expression&gt; light years away from the way Salvatore portrayed him.  This lack of continuity is really an ongoing problem in the NJO series and Stackpole should not be singled out for blame.  Overall this is an entertaining, average Stackpole book, but keep in mind that since Stackpole is one of the 2 best writers in the Star Wars universe, then anything average is still better than the work by most other authors.	2002-06-28

Superior NJO book	This is the better of Stackpole's 2 NJO books.  Like all his books it is well written, with suspense-filled battle sequences and strong well-written characters.  The ending is a shock that I didn't see coming.  The involvement of the Imperial Remnant was a master stroke as was the inclusion of the Chiss.  The plot was strong, stronger than the previous Dark Tide book, Onslaught.  The involvement of more people than just the usual 6 galaxy saviors was a refreshing change.  The battle for Ithor was intense, and with almost all the Jedi fighting, it was reminiscent of the huge Jedi battle scene in Attack of the Clones.  Overall a much better Stackpole book (although still not as good as Stackpole's X-Wing books or I, Jedi), and among the top 5 in the NJO series.	2002-06-05
US	50896776	R3ENFSPIGE883C	0345428455	87344379	Vector Prime (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 1)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good Beginning to the NJO series	As far as the New Jedi Order goes, Vector Prime is a perfect launch  point.  The story is crisp and compelling.  The reader feels great symphathy for the characters, and after the last few Star Wars disasters (the Callista trilogy as I call them Children of the Jedi, Darksaber, Planet of Twilight), Salvatore's springboard book is truly good.  The introduction of a foe that can not be sensed in the Force makes the Jedi into mortals again.  Kyp Durron is made a viable character, no longer a Luke Skywalker clone.  The Solo children take a prominant role in this book, which helps inject new life in the Star Wars book universe.  Now we come to the issue of Chewbacca's death.  It was and is a brilliant idea and Salvatore's writing at this point is equally brilliant.  Chewie's death stirs up the comfort zone that readers sometimes place around characters.  Chewie is also not always necessary in every story either (check out the Hand of Thrawn books).  Salvatore also sheds new light on the nature of Han and Chewie's relationship, which ultimately makes his death that much more of an emotional hammer blow to the reader.  Han's reactions to his children flying into danger are also extremely emotional.  Vector Prime is a strong, well-written story, one of the best in the NJO series.  The only problem I have with this book is Salvatore's adjective usage which gets increasingly redundant, ie  the unshakable Jaina, the devasted Han.  Phrases such as these are used too frequently throughout the book, but are Salvatore's writing style as they appear in Salvatore's Attack of the Clones adaption too.  I find it a bit distracting, but that is simply a personal opinion.	2002-06-04

Allston again writes an excellent addition to the NJO series.  Rebel Stand is more concentrated then Rebel Dream, with the subplots focussing more clearly on the main characters.  While he adds in a few returning faces (Wes Janson makes his NJO debut), Allston never loses focus of his story.  Every NJO author writes a specific character better than others, Stackpole writes Corran Horn the best, Keyes wrote Anakin the best, etc, Allston wrote Han and Leia the best in this book.  No other author in the NJO series so far has captured the essense of who Han and Leia are, not merely legend they represent.  I am trying not to give any of the plot away, but the scene where Han and Leia escape from the Peace Brigade is pure Star Wars.  Luke and Mara are not forgotten on Curuscant, and though again nothing is mentioned of the captured Jacen Solo, an old enemy is resurrected, and general chaos reigns.  Its really great stuff.  Allston also focuses on the tactical side of the war with the Vong, his depiction of Wedge Antilles is masterful, as is the battle plan presented.  Jaina Solo comes into her own, no longer under the influence of the Dark Side, and healing from the losses of her brothers.  Overall after the darkness of Star by Star and Dark Journey, Allston's two books have been a welcome change, and are simply excellent.  Perhaps he will write again for the Star Wars universe, and if he does, I will be among the first to buy the book.  Rebel Stand is highly recommend, not just as a great addition to the NJO series but as a Star Wars book in general.	2002-06-04

The first few books of the NJO series (with the exception of Vector Prime) focussed on the Jedi as a whole and on Han Solo.  Balance Point brings the NJO series back to out main Star Wars character Han, Leia, Luke, Mara, and the Solo kids.  That is a refreshing change from Lucado's 2 books.  The book starts well with Jaina flying in Rogue Squadron being shot down and wounded.  The bond between Jaina and Jacen is brought to light, this is an important point that will be visited again in the NJO series.  There are no sections of this story that are not entertaining.  Whether its Luke, Mara and Anakin ferreting out a Vong spy on Curuscant, Han and the twins fighting to save the refugees under their care or Leia struggling to uncover a sinister plot in the midst of great trials, its all entertaining.  Tyers writes both Anakin and Jaina with more of a quiet maturity than Jacen.  He comes off as more than a little obnoxious at some points, with his struggle to use or not use the Force.  The climax of the story is captivating and powerful as is the full extent of Jacen's Force abilities.  The last chapter, with the Vong Warmaster setting a price on the heads of the Jedi sets up the next 3 or 4 books of the series.  Tyers writes a great story.  Balance Point, while lacking some of the comedic tone of Allston's recent Enemy Lines books, is the best out of the first 5 NJO books and a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe.	2002-06-04

There are two portions to this review, the overall review and the plot review.  The first part is for everyone, the second part is only for those who want the story plot and details. Part 1:  Overall this book is an excellent addition to the NJO series.  Its a great turn around from the depressing NJO Dark Journey.  Allston shows that his X-Wing books were no fluke.  He has a firm grasp of the characters and the plotline.  The darker tone of the previous books is lessened, and once again, the NJO series feels like Star Wars.  The characters are still mythologically Star Wars, but like the movies, Allston has made them even more humanlike.  He added the classic Star Wars wit and humor to the NJO series.  The only major criticism I have of this book is that it is too short.<br />Part 2 (PLot):<BR>Coruscant has fallen, Jaina Solo has slipped into the dark side but returned with Kyp Durron's help.  Han Solo, Princess Leia and Mara Jade return to the center stage.  Now Wedge Antilles shows why the New Republic generals are just as tactically sound as the Vong.  He leads the New Republic to victory retaking a previously Vong held world.  All the major characters return, as the Vong struggle to counter this sudden New Republic military competancy.  Luke Skywalker, no longer content with actionless defense,  receives visions of the dark side on Coruscant, and he goes to confront it accompanied by his wife some commandoes.  There is also the possibility of rescue for Jacen although most believe he is dead.  All in all a great story.  Its short length and the absence of any information regarding Jacen are the only reasons for 4 not 5 stars.	2002-04-01

Fine Addition to NJO Series	First, if you haven't read Star by Star, or if you don't want to know the vague storyline for Dark Journey, DON'T read this review.<BR>This is a revision of my first revieww, because after I read this book a few times my perception of it changed. This story is another well written addition to the New Jedi Order series. It wraps up many of the loose storylines that James Luceno's NJO books started. The story itself focuses on Jaina Solo and the escape of the Jedi strike team from a Vong held world as told in Star by Star. With the recent death of Anakin and the capture of Jacen, Jaina is dangerously close to the dark side. As they strike force flees from the Vong, they go to the Hapan system where more intrigue awaits. Kyp Durron is prominately featured again, and he continues to evolve in a well rounded character. It is really up to Durron to make Jaina see how dangerous the line she is treading is. This story revolves around Jaina, Kyp, Jagged Fel and the Hapan Royal family. While the Skywalkers, Han & Leia all play minor roles, almost nothing is said of Jacen. None of the chapters are from his point of view. The reader hears about him early in the story, but nothing is confirmed. Again this is a good story, the characters are well written, but the lack of any of the story from Jacen's perspective is a bit of a let down.  At first this story seems a bit lacking when compared to other NJO books, but that is simply not the case.  Its a very subtle book, in perfect harmony with Jaina's first steps on the path to the dark side. Many readers dismissed this book out of hand, I encourage NJO fans to read this story.  Its essential to the continuation of the NJO, and is really a good book on its own.	2002-02-20

Conquest is an excellent addition to the New Jedi Order series. Just when it seemed that the books were going to get predictable, Keyes takes the story in a different direction. This story is not as dark as some of the books in this series, most notably Star by Star which is very dark. Keyes captured the well-known characters perfectly. Although I was unfamiliar with many of the younger characters in this book, Keyes does an excellent job introducing them and integrating them into the older, more mature Star Wars books. Some people have complained about the length of the story, while it is shorter than some Star Wars books, but that doesn't detract from the excellent story at all. Some books just keep going, taking forever to get to the point. Conquest does not do this. As for the story focussing more on Anakin, it was really his turn. The first 3 NJO books focused on the Jedi as a whole, while the second 2 focussed on Han Solo. The book directly before conquest focussed on the twins more, so it was really Anakin's time. The casting of the Vong as different castes and in a more sympathetic light was a stroke of genius. The only reason this book has 4 stars instead of 5 is because as good as it is, Rebirth is better.	2001-11-13

Star by Star is an excellent addition to the New Jedi Order Series.  It is a very tense action packed story that does not falter.  An important main character is killed (which is highly suspect, I agree with previous reviewer), and when this character &quot;dies&quot; it is like a physical blow to you.  The reactions of the different people that experience this death are very human not what you normally expect of the heroes of the Star Wars Universe, reminding the reader that no matter how powerful a Jedi Master is they are still only human.  This story is much darker, very different in tone than the Keyes's Conquest and Rebirth.  As with all the other books in the series, however, Denning continues to add every Jedi ever mentioned previously into his story. This is not a book for children.  There are serious issues and lots of death and destruction in it.  This story pulls the reader in and does not let you go.  I finished it in one night because I could not put it down.  When I was finished I felt emotionally drained from it.  Of all the New Jedi Order books written only Rebirth is better than Star by Star.	2001-11-09

I have been reading Star Wars books regularly since Tim Zahn's first trilogy first hit the stands, and I have watched while lesser authors (with a few notable exceptions) slowly lowered the quality of the books.  Then came the New Jedi Order Series.  The first books were excellent and the authors have seemed to just get better.  Then comes Greg Keyes.  His first book was good but his second, REBIRTH, is probably among the top 10 Star Wars novels ever written.  Keyes has an excellent grasp of the characters and doesn't overload the cliches.  He writes in such a way that although the reader realizes that the Solo young adults are warriors and Jedi knights, it is also apparant that they are still young and naive.  Corran Horn absent since the 3rd book of this series has returned with a vengeance.  And Keyes is also able to write one of the most (unfairly) maligned characters in Star Wars expanded universe history in a sympathetic light (Kyp Durron). Keyes knows the history of the expanded universe, and uses this knowledge quite effectively.  I have already written a list of the top 25 Star Wars novels, but I will have to modify it to ensure Rebirth's placement.  Once again an exceptional book in an excellent series.	2001-08-07

It's not a Grant Morrison story, but it is nevertheless a good read.  The dialogues between the Titans and the JLA are great, and really bring out the fact that although  both teams exist for the the benfit of the world, the Titans are more of a  family type atmosphere.  What is also great is that during the big fight  scene Batman and Nightwing are having an argument about who is right in the  middle of a battle.  During the entire story neither throws a punch.  You  can also see just how much the mentors of the Titans care for their onetime  sidekicks, and how grown up those same sidekicks have become.  Overall a  great story.

With the  exception of some of Kyle's dialogue most of the book was well written.   Apparantly Kyle has a habit of repeating himself, because he uses the same  phrase when talking to Batman that he does with every other hero.  Hal's  acceptance by the Justice League, and Kyle's subsaquentjealousy make for an  interesting read.  The Hal Jorden Green Lantern &amp; Green Arrow sub-plot  is an interesting combination.
