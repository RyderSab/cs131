It traces the history of Arab intellectuals in the 19th century and of the evolving schools of thought in the Arab world that was divided among conservative Muslims, reformist Muslims and secular nationalists.<br /><br />Such schools of the thought in the Arab world were provoked by the arrival of the French expedition of Napoleon in Egypt in 1798. The interaction between the French and the Egyptians made Arabs realize how far they have become form the modern world and the need to modernize. While conservative Muslims believed that change was a matter of betraying the teachings of religion, propagators of reforming Islam called for the revision of Muslim practices saying that it was only by restoring religion to its original form that the Muslim nation would be able to catch up on the world's civilization advances. Reformers, however, fell short of advocating a coherent agenda for change as their calls eventually fell on deaf ears.<br /><br />Meanwhile, non-Muslim subjects of the Ottoman empire were keen to come up with a formula that would allow them to be treated as citizens with full rights. Accordingly, intellectuals of these minorities advanced secular nationalism ideologies, certainly under the influence of a surge of such ideas in Europe.<br /><br />Sharabi narrates with skill the career of the most important figures of that era and his book allows readers to understand the origins of current ideological and intellectual trends in the Arab world.	2005-09-23

His French socialist background made him tie his theories about Islam to Marxist interpretation of the reason behind class struggle. To him, the rise of militant Islam was mainly due to changes in fortunes and the shift in class alliances among the different societies of the Muslim countries.<br /><br />In this brief book, Kepel records his observations about one of his tours of the Middle East in what seems like a reporter's diary. Without going into complicated analysis, Kepel interviews the Egyptian Muslim instigator Sheikh Mohammed Qardawi who is given a show on the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera channel.<br /><br />He visits malls in the gulf and notices, how despite the conservative nature of the society there, young men and women still manage to exchange glances and drop each others notes of love and probably dating as they shop at such malls.<br /><br />What is very interesting in Kipel's work is his long stay in the Middle East since he was a student and his fluency in Arabic. This makes of Kepel not only an expert of Muslim countries but also almost one of the natives.<br /><br />The chapters are disconnected which makes it easier for the readers to start with the chapters that they feel might be more interesting than others. The translation from the French original script, however, reflects a bit on the style of the book and renders it sometimes dull.	2005-09-23

It highlights the culture barrier between an American who was assigned to help recover the American character of this school, which throughout Lebanon's long civil war was dominated by local officers who brought with them their \\"Arab way\\" of doing things at the time it was too risky for Americans to maintain any presence in war-shattered Lebanon.<br /><br />As the chapters of this very-well researched book unfold, the experience of a school president in his failed mission to modernize the school tells a lot about why the United States was rarely successful in most of its endeavors in the Arab world, on top of them its war in Iraq and its effort to democratize it.<br /><br />Consequently, this book appeals to several audiences. Naturally, the first one of these audiences would be the International College's community and its graduates in addition to the community of the American University of Beirut (AUB) and a third American school in Beirut, the American Community School (ACS) as Ober tells the story of American missionaries and produces the history of the establishment of both IC and AUB, their affiliation and their later separation that resulted in their disagreement over real estate issues.<br /><br />The second kind of audience would be students of the Middle East in the West and, to an extent, Western governments. After all, this 19th century missionary activity survived more than a century and its experience should be studied should the West decide to embark on such missions of modernization in the Arab world.	2005-09-23

The idea of the book in itself is very interesting and deserves a long debate. The authors of this volume, however, survey bits and pieces of ideas from around the world by capturing general trends in non-Western countries while failing to offer any concrete examples material. The book is insightful but brief and very much editrialized.<br /><br />When Edward Said offered his description of the way Westerners view the East, his point was focused because in the West, such an activity is mostly centralized and undertaken by academics in the anglophone world which counts less than 10 countries. Yet, reversing this trend, that is recording how the world views the West, is certainly not the same. The diverse world with more than 200 nations certainly has diverse ideas and perspectives about the West and it does not sound accurate if we summarize all of these diverse perspectives in such a brief work.<br /><br />At any rate, the ideas offered in the book are valid, though not enough to put all of the non-Western nations in a single category. The style is rather dry and a reader might find him/herself struggling to keep up with the points the authors try to make.	2005-09-23

He writes that while science can fix a date for the evolution of homo sapiens form ape, it remains hard to tell why the different civilizations witnessed different jumpstarts at different times in history.<br /><br />Accordingly, Diamond employs his encyclopedic knowledge of human and social sciences to draw conclusions about how environment caused certain peoples to develop in certain ways.

The brilliance of this book is based on two factors. First, its choice of what to highlight and what to leave out was extremely successful and relevant for those who want to read history to understand modern day Iraq, and second, its dependency on the bottom lines of reliable secondary sources instead of amassing a big number of quotes from primary sources in order to make a point or two.<br /><br />The choice of what to cover and how to cover events from Iraq's history yielded this extremely helpful book that brings 5000 years of history into this concise and brief book.<br /><br />Abdullah's style is extremely catching and flows with practically no repetition. Unlike most history books on the subject, Abdullah economizes with the number of names and dates that he included in the book in order not to distract the reader's attention by bombarding him/her with an unlimited number of often irrelevant names.<br /><br />Furthermore, Abdullah maintains much needed objectivity when telling Iraq's story at the time most of history books on the Middle East are loaded with prejudice and either explicit or hidden propaganda.<br /><br />Other valuable insights include Abdullah's tracing of the regional influence on Iraq, both from the Sunni Arab West and the Shiite Persian East.

Adrenal Fatigue offers a revolutionary different approach saying that the main reason behind stress is the stress of the body's adrenal glands, two peanut-sized glands on top of each kidney, that are crucial for regulating the body's temperature, hormones, mood and energy.<br /><br />The book does not only offer a diagnosis but rather offers a complete lifestyle plan that is supposed to make the body relax and restore its energy. The suggested program is around three months long and includes changing one's diet by decreasing the intake of junk food and increasing that of organic food and vitamin supplements. The book is also strict on the importance of organizing eating and sleeping hours.<br /><br />Even though the book suggests an alternative lifestyle that might sound harsh to many, its insight is very relieving for stress sufferers and if those manage to implement half of the book's suggested plan, they would notice an improvement in their health, restoration in their energy and reduction in their stress levels.<br /><br />Even though in terms of style the book is sometimes needlessly long and in other times dry and written in a medical style, it offers self-tests as a means of diagnosis and these tests also determine the levels of stress among those who take them.<br /><br />So far, this is the most convincing, cohesive and well-designed books on stress that brings together alternative medicine, diet and other tips that would certainly help doing away with stress.	2005-08-25

Whereas almost all other books are loaded with interviews with politicians and analysts and are decorated with conclusions trying to understand the causes of the war and assess its consequent destruction, Jean Said Makdisi, the sister of the late famous Palestinian writer Edward Said, describes with skill her daily stressful life in Beirut during the Lebanese capital's dark days.<br /><br />Where did people go when the different militias endlessly battled and exchanged bombardment with no apparent reason behind such behavior? How did people manage their daily lives? In Lebanon, answers to these questions are abundant and people talk about them anecdotally and sometimes with nostalgia. Yet, Makdisi offers the most remarkable written testament on the issue.<br /><br />One of the book's most intriguing statements occurs toward the beginning of the books when Makdisi tries, in vein, to interpret the behavior of the warring factions as she comes up with the conclusion that the scene of the Lebanese civil strife was an incomprehensible kaleidoscope.<br /><br />This marvelous book, however, includes a chapter about Makdisi's childhood days with her family in Egypt. The chapter, which belongs more to a book of memoirs or an autobiography, looks very much out of place and irrelevant.<br /><br />Another drawback is Makdisi's apparent intention to capture the feelings of the people who survived the war in an absolute sense rather than offering a descriptive report about the days of this war as seen from the eyes of a regular citizen like Makdisi. Her attempt to keep the book empty of any names or dates - perhaps in order to keep the book away from inter-Lebanese sensitivities - strips the book of any context. Even though I was born and raised in Ras Beirut during the civil war, I could hardly imagine the places or tell the dates the book refers to, except for the Israeli invasion and the so-called War of Liberation.<br /><br />This severe anonymity made Makdisi keep out even the names of her sons or immediate family members save for a single name, that of her husband Samir, which appeared without such restriction.<br /><br />The book is a lovely read and Lebanon certainly needs more similar books with more names and dates that would describe the suffering of the daily lives of the Lebanese during that period.d the so-called War of Liberation. <br />This severe anonymity made Makdisi keep out even the names of her sons or immediate family members save for a single name, that of her husband Samir, which appeared without such restriction. <br />The book is a lovely read and Lebanon certainly needs more similar books with more names and dates that would describe the suffering of the daily lives of the Lebanese during that period.	2005-08-25

This thoroughly researched work enriched by Gaspard's long experience in economics has yet to be matched in the field.<br /><br />Gaspard offers an alternative perspective on the weakness of the Lebanese Economy saying that this weakness has more to do with the economic and political structure of the nation rather than mere government policies. According to Gaspard, Lebanon's founding fathers based their young nation on the ideology of laissez faire economy, which despite displaying some positive figures in the past, was inherently weak and doomed to collapse sooner or later. Instead, Gaspard said that the instances that witnessed strong economic performance in Lebanon should have been invested in developing the industrial sector that would in turn create skilled labor as opposed to the country's current semi-skilled and unskilled laborers at the time the skilled among them emigrate.<br /><br />Gaspard argues that Lebanon witnessed some favorable instance in history were it was possible to move to industrialization: During the late 19th century when an inflow of French capital invested in the country's then booming textile industry that later demised and during the years of WWII and later the Korean crisis when the shortage in Western imports and capital follow into the country for the support of allied troops and other purposes put Lebanon in favorable situation to industrialize. Such models where tested in Asian countries known later as Asian Tigers after they scored remarkable economic development in post-industrialization periods.<br /><br />Yet Lebanon's founders and successive governments never allowed this option to crystallize and preferred, time and gain, the laissez faire model which ultimately proved its failure.<br /><br />The book's introduction is particularly enlightening as it compares the different schools of world economies saying that mere fact that the United States economy displayed strength in the 1990s is not enough to prove that laissez faire economies lead to better economic development. He believes that time would later tell whether this model was successful or not and whether the world needs to reconsider some form of government intervention in planning their nations' economies.mere fact that the United States economy displayed strength in the 1990s is not enough to prove that laissez faire economies lead to better economic development.

His book is one of rare stock in the West as it summarizes social and political literature that is widely circulated in the Arab world but is not accessible to Western readers.<br />Ajami's writing style that flows in an entertaining manner adds flavor to the book. This is coupled with a kind of analysis that is in line with Western methodology but that sticks, at the same time, to viewing things from native Eastern eyes.<br />The only take against Ajami's work is his overgeneralization of the Egyptian Arab model arguing that it is enough for someone to understand Egypt, the mirror of the Arab world, in order to understand the rest of the Arab countries.<br />While this point is debatable, it does not confirm with the book's main argument that pan-Arabism that reached its climax under late Egyptian President Nasser, was merely a fantasy and an artificial front behind which Arab military dictatorships hid and under whose banner they repressed their peoples. If Arab nationalism was a mere fantasy, why did Ajami take Egypt as the mirror of 21 other nations?<br />Also, if Egypt was as promising as Ajami believes, how come it never modernized 10 years after the printing of this book and is still considered one of the tyrannical regimes that breed popular frustration and ultimately terror groups.<br />In any case, other arguments pertaining to the reasons behind failure are accurate. These include Ajami's criticism of progressive secular thought of the so-called Arab revolutionaries that was never able to take off and thus conceded to and depended on the power of regressive traditional powers.	2005-07-16

The topic was the subject of Salibi's PhD dissertation at the University of London.<br /><br />According to Salibi, the first account of Maronite history came in the form of popular poetry when a certain 15th century Maronite poet/historian with a name Ibn al-Qilaii provided the first such verion of his community's roots and origin. The second more interesting and more controversial Maronite historian was the community's patriarch, Estfan Duweihi.<br /><br />According to Duweihi, the Maronites were never of an origin stock. Duweihi, the 18th century Maornite patriarch, claimed that Saint Maron, the presumed 5th century founder of the sect, was the nephew of 9th century French King Charlemagne. Apparently, the confusion in establishing dates never occurred to Duweihi who for most probably political reasons, rewrote his community's account in a way that best fit it politically at the time. This was the time when the Maronites were seeking foreign French support facing the Middle East's Muslim majority.<br /><br />Salibi argues with skill that most of the Maronites who documented the history of their community did so with a political agenda in the back of their minds, rendering their accounts mostly inaccurate. Instead, Salibi believes that the Maronites come from a pure Arab stock and had, in ancient times, emigrated from the southern region of Yemen heading to the Syrian coast (which includes Syrian, Lebanon and Palestine).<br /><br />Salibi's version of the Maronite history was seen unfavorable by the Maornite church. Salibi's debates with religious scholars on this and other similar issues are well known.	2005-06-17

It is unfortunate that the book was written before 9/11 and the start of the war on terrorism, save for a brief afterward that is mostly in line with Kissinger's pre 9/11 views.<br /><br />The book is entertaining and put in a very organized sequence. It highlights the cross Atlantic world leading American-European alliance and offers fresh perspective on how these relations should develop as the European Union gains shape and witnesses a surge in its economic, demographic and geographic might.<br /><br />Kissinger also talks about other regions in the world including the Middle East and Africa. The book has a much needed historical background about all of the events that it discusses making it easier for readers who are not familiar with overseas issues to get a grasp of what the author is talking about. Kissinger then gives his recommendations on how America should handle its world affairs in the coming century.<br /><br />He debates the United States role in a growingly globalized world and offers suggestions on how America should deal with global organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the World Bank.<br /><br />Kissinger sounds more often than not a traditionalist in his foreign policy perspective in that he doesn't view fighting terrorism as the world's top priority. He rather maintains a tone of what America should do to maintain its \\"assets\\" and \\"strategic interests\\" around the world and how this would define America's role making or breaking of world affairs.<br /><br />The book also lacks accurate research and is kind of a blown up opinion. For example, Kissinger mentions a ruling Sunni majority in Iraq and an opposing two minority blocs, the Shiites and Kurds. It is a known fact, however, that the Shiites are the Iraqi majority.	2005-06-17

The topic was the subject of Salibi's PhD dissertation at the University of London.<br /><br />According to Salibi, the first account of Maronite history came in the form of popular poetry when a certain 15th century Maronite poet/historian with a name Ibn al-Qilaii provided the first such verion of his community's roots and origin. The second more interesting and more controversial Maronite historian was the community's patriarch, Estfan Duweihi.<br /><br />According to Duweihi, the Maronites were never of an origin stock. Duweihi, the 18th century Maornite patriarch, claimed that Saint Maron, the presumed 5th century founder of the sect, was the nephew of 9th century French King Charlemagne. Apparently, the confusion in establishing dates never occurred to Duweihi who for most probably political reasons, rewrote his community's account in a way that best fit it politically at the time. This was the time when the Maronites were seeking foreign French support facing the Middle East's Muslim majority.<br /><br />Salibi argues with skill that most of the Maronites who documented the history of their community did so with a political agenda in the back of their minds, rendering their accounts mostly inaccurate. Instead, Salibi believes that the Maronites come from a pure Arab stock and had, in ancient times, emigrated from the southern region of Yemen heading to the Syrian coast (which includes Syrian, Lebanon and Palestine).<br /><br />Salibi's version of the Maronite history was seen unfavorable by the Maornite church. Salibi's debates with religious scholars on this and other similar issues are well known.	2005-06-17

As always, the problem with Americans analyzing their country's foreign policy is their weakness in understanding the nations that this policy targets in the first place.<br />The book is full of contradictions. Satloff suggests that America should not treat Arabs and Muslims as a uniform nation lest pan-Arabism and pan-Islamisms inflame further anti-Americanism. Throughout his book, however, he treats the Arab world -- for the most part -- as being a single bloc and offers the many similar recommendations to all of the 22 Arab states.<br />Satloff also endorses a tone of an expert on the minds and hearts of Arabs. It is hard to tell, however, what stands behind such claims. True that he lived in Morocco. Yet, American ambassadors around the world usually commute in armored motorcades and rarely get in touch with the average citizens of the nations where they serve. More often than not such ambassadors - who after their service become outspoken experts on the countries where they served - mostly get to meet these countries' ruling elite and upscale people who rarely reflect what is on the mind of an average Arab Joe. Without understanding what is on these people's minds, \\"battling\\" for their hearts and minds - as Satloff suggests - seem like a losing battle.<br />In terms of style, the book has some redundant pieces and it would have been much better had Satloff decided to merge all og his article ideas into one coherent work.	2005-06-14

He is the President of the Council of Foreign Relations and served on a number of high posts in previous administrations. In this brief book, Haas provides a number of arguments to sustain his perspective on handling America's foreign policy. According to Haas, America should restore its previous policy of containment, d&eacute;tente and trying to defeat world dictators by eroding their ability to sustain their tyrannical rule. A case in point is Saddam Hussain.<br />Haas argues that had the United States opted for tightening the grip around Saddam's neck by cutting off his trade links with neighboring countries such as Turkey and Jordan and subsidizing the losses these nations might have incurred due to such trade interruption, the confrontation with Saddam Hussain could have cost the United States much less treasure and blood. Haas should have said, however, how he believes sanctions could have ever affected Saddam. If the Iraqis were to live spending their last one penny, that penny would be in Saddam's pocket and he would have maintained his power despite his people's poverty by murdering every one of them. Saddam's rule was not based on economic prosperity or illegal trade with Jordan, Turkey and Syria. His rule was one of tyranny and brutal oppression and the only way to topple him was through the usage of power.<br />Now Haas believes that despite Saddam's tyranny, his rule was not disruptive of America's national security. At this point, America should question the moral ground at large of its relations with Saddam. Should he have been removed for his threat on America only or shouldn't the world's superpower go after the world's bloodiest dictators to save his people of his murderous grip?<br />Another point Haas failed to answer, assuming containing dictators that posed no threat to America's security was a good idea: how would America be able to fight poverty and tyranny that breed terror with such containment policies? Saudi Arabia is America's good ally and yet 15 of its citizens, frustrated by their rulers' tyranny and oppression, committed 9/11. Most of these Arab dictatorships are in the first place based on preaching anti-Americanism to divert their people's frustration with domestic problems and blame other nations, on top of them America, for their agony.<br />Haas should have reconsidered his call on the foreign policy to go back to the old school that had proved in the past - time and again - its futility. And before he urges the administration to abandon its current military confrontation strategies that might bring improved home security, he should have come up with a third option that could have been better than the two only ways currently at the disposal of Washington.Arabia is America's good ally and yet 15 of its citizens, frustrated by their rulers' tyranny and oppression, committed 9/11.

Books	5	8	10	N	N	The first accurate version on Lebanese history	Noted historian Kamal Salibi wrote this book right after he had acquired his PhD in the mid-1960s. His skill and genius is evident as the book covers the history of the most of the fragments of the Lebanese society that has been since the dawn of history divided into sectarian communities.<br /><br />Still, Salibi's perspective on Lebanon and his understanding of the country and its history changed by the time he had released his second book that also covers the history of this small Mediterranean nation. His book, A House of Many Mansions, is a later version of Salibi's view on the Modern History of Lebanon. This latter book appeared I around 1989.<br /><br />Therefore, despite the wonderful style and the amount of information The Modern History of Lebanon offers, I suggest that readers go for the more updated version and buy A House of Many Mansions where this leading historian comes up with more innovative analysis and bold statements.<br /><br />A House of Many Mansions has also been very controversial since Salibi argues that Maronites had always been a Church following the rite of the Eastern Church and that the community is originally of an Arab stock that had emigrated from Yemen in old times. Maronite historians, the subject of Salibi's PhD dissertation, started rewriting their history after the great schism between the Eastern and the Western Church in the mid 15th century by linking the history of their Church to the Catholic Church of Rome instead of their original following of the Eastern Church of Antioch.	2005-06-11

I'm a native Iraqi. David Phillips is no doubt an insider and his book unveils a lot of the confusion within the administration on how to handle Iraq. This book is good as an assessment of the performance of the administration at large. I don't believe it is good to explain the American failure in Iraq.<br />From an Iraqi perspective, America's endeavor in Iraq came to a bitter end not because of State and DoD rivalry. America failed because both State and DoD didn't understand Iraq's language, culture, sociology and anthropology. Failure happened because experts like Phillips analyzed and assessed the situation there from the comfort of their offices inside the beltway in Washington DC.<br />Before writing on Losing Iraq, try first Understanding it. Phillips's book should be put in this context. Still, the book has good information on the need to get the administration's house in order if the United States is to regain its leading role in the world, yet Losing Iraq falls shorts on debating the Iraq issue from outside American partisanship.	2005-06-11

If this is the best analysis of the Iraqi situation a Stanford professor deployed to Iraq could come up with, then it is perfectly understandable how the United States was never able to grasp what's going on there.<br /><br />Read the book's description: \\"America's leading expert on democracy delivers the first insider's account of the U.S. occupation of Iraq.\\" The leading expert on democracy is not an Arabic speaker and his background on the Middle East seems minimal. His knowledge on the Arab world, like his expertease on democracy, comes mainly from Western media and secondary English sources rather than from primary Arabic texts or sources.<br /><br />As for the \\"the first insider's account of the U.S. occupation of Iraq,\\" well, the account was of such an insider that during his stay in Baghdad, he spent all of his time inside the heavily fortified Green Zone - according to his own account - save for a single trip that he made to Babylon in an armored SUV.<br /><br />Put all of this given together and here's what you get: A Stanford professor and fellow at one of Washington's prestigious think tanks, National Endowment for Democracy, received a call from his personal friend, then National Security Advisor and today's Secretary of State Condi Rice, seeking his participation in salvaging America's attempt to establish democracy in Iraq. With no Arabic and minimum knowledge about Iraq and the Arab world that were apparent in the form of factual mistakes in his book, Diamond joined the American-made Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.<br /><br />His interpretation of what went wrong there came through his observation of the head of CPA Paul Bremer instead of trying to understand the behavior of Iraqis.<br /><br />And if that's not enough, Diamond even came up with some recommendations that he thought could rectify the situation there. Why not send UN envoy Algerian (Arab) Lakhdar brahimi, who is Sunni, to patch things up in Iraq? After all, he succeeded in a similar mission in Afghanistan. For those who don't know, the majority of the population in Iraq is Arab-speaking Iraqi Shiites. The majority in Afghanistan is Urdu-speaking Pashtun Sunnis. Does the cultural and ethnic difference ring any bell? To the majority in Afghanistan, Brahimi was an impartial Arab UN envoy, Sunni like they are. To the majority of Iraqis, this Sunni Arab was an official of the Arab League which Iraqi Shiites abhorr. He had good links with the toppled Saddam Hussein who oppressed these Shiites. He sumpathized with the agenda of the region's Arab Sunnis, which was in conflict with that of the Arab Shiites. Does he look impartial at all to Iraqi Shiites? Of course not. To many Americans, he does.<br /><br />I cited this one example to illustrate how shallow and superficial the knowledge of this expert on Iraq is... and he still has the guts to criticize the administration for squandering a chance in Iraq. His book is the best example of why America lost an opportunity there in the first place, not a guide on how it could have been avoided.b) Lakhdar brahimi, who is Sunni, to patch things up in Iraq?

Being one of a very few scholars who had visited Saudi Arabia's archaeological sites, closed to scholars and visitors, Salibi offer an unmatched understanding of the geography and history of this region.<br /><br />His book is a quick survey that does not leave out any detail about the people's and history of this region since the dawn of ancient Arabia. The first chapters offer a particularly interesting classification of the peoples who lived in the area, some who ceased to maintain their Arab lineage, others who became sedentary urbanized communities while a third group of nomads that kept on roving the desert.<br /><br />This book is very insightful and is a must read as an introduction to anyone interested in the history of the region. Salibi argues that since ancient days, Arabia - which is today's Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates and parts of Iraq - has been a strategic point of for East-West trade. This prominent role has made civilizations fight over its control until the discovery of oil reserves there, which renewed the international interest in this region.<br /><br />Salibi's recording of the area's history starts with ancient days and reaches World War I. He also offers a unique perspective about the factors that led to the division of the Middle East in its current shape among British and French influence. If you can get hold of this book, you certainly have to buy it and keep it as one of the best references on this subject.	2005-06-11

The book is more of a political platform of a politician who - a year after publishing this book - became Israel's Prime Minister.<br /><br />In this context, Netanyahu's analysis becomes very simplistic and while the while of the civilized world is classified in one bloc, terrorists also become a single body without any possible rivalries, animosities or differences between them.<br /><br />Since 9/11, dozens of works have been written about terrorism and scholastic findings have shown that terrorists are far from being united or coordinating their efforts. We know for sure, for example, that the fundamentalists Sunni Taliban have been opposed, all along, to the Shiite Afghani population and to the regime of the Iranian mullahs. Putting all of these groups into one group is inaccurate.<br /><br />Netanyahu also offers a single solution for terrorism: confrontation. He says that the terrorists have the will without power while the civilized world has the power and must find the will. Today, four years after 9/11 and two years after the liberation of Iraq, the civilized world has come to realize that military power is far from resolving the problem of terrorism. It merely complicated it. This is not to say that terrorists should remain at large without punishment. Yet, there is no one-size-fit-all solution for the different kinds of terrorism.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning that Netanyahu underestimated the motives of terrorists. Other works by prominent scholars such as Bernard Lewis and Gilles Kipel suggest that several motives stand behind terrorism and vary between an illusion of wanting to destroy the only remaining super power, the United States, after presumably destroying the other super power, the Soviet Union and socioeconomic inequalities mostly in countries with tyrannical regimes.<br /><br />Even though the book is brief, it is not as attractive and sounds more of an extended speech rather than a concrete study or the experience of someone who has participated in law enforcement operations both as a soldier and a politician.

Leveret t provides a highly accurate description of the power circle in Syria despite the few minor mistakes.<br />The author then cites a number of Bashar's statements and encounters to support the book's main point: that Bashar Assad has genuine intentions for change and positive overture toward the United States except that the US is not currently willing to reciprocate this kind of behavior.<br />Leverett then examines the possibilities facing America when dealing with rogue states like Syria. According to Leverett, there are four options: sanctions, military campaigns or alternatively, Leverett suggests that the United States employs what he terms as \\"conditional engagement.\\"<br />The author dismisses sanctions saying that they proved to be inadequate if applied unilaterally without Europe's involvement. He argues that military campaigns exposed America's limited human and financial resources as the United States maintains considerable missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and other regions of the world.<br />Therefore, Leverett suggests that the US start building trust with Syria and provide Bashar and his young team leverage over the old guard in his presumed bid to change and modernize Syria. American-Syrian trust building can start from the successful exchange of intelligence information on Al-Qaeda and be expanded to include exchange of other favors. According to Leverett, these incentives would be the carrots as opposed to the many sticks with which America will threaten Syria in case the latter fails to comply.<br />Consequently, and over the medium and long terms, such a policy will benefit both nations even though the author does not suggest that it will lead to the democratization of Syria. He stated, however, that trying to unseat Bashar would only bring instability and Muslim fundamentalists to power and that Bashar remains America's best bid in Syria.<br />The hypothesis of the book is interesting, even though it has nothing new to it. This kind of containment-of-dictators policy has dominated America's foreign policy prior to 9/11 and has not proven any particular success. Furthermore, a main prophecy in the book failed the test of time since according to Leverett, a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon would lead to a Lebanese civil war. By the time this review was written, Syrian troops had been outside of Lebanon for over a month and nothing like civil strife yet appears to be coming in the Lebanese horizons.<br />As for Israel, Leverett makes it known that Bashar's attitude to the US is independent of the procession of any Syrian-Israeli peace. Leverett quoted Bashar as saying that he was ready to \\"bracket\\" the peace process for the time being while he improves Damascus's bilateral relations with Washington. This can only be a proof that Arab dictators like Bashar are never as genuinely concerned about re-gaining any disputed land inasmuch as they are interested in keeping the Arab-Israeli conflict going so that they can use it as a pretext to justify their leadership and divert their people's hate against foreign enemies and away from their tyranny and corruption.undamentalists to power and that Bashar remains America's best bid in Syria.

In this context, Ilario Salucci's A People's History of Iraq: The Iraqi Communist Party, Workers' Movements and the left 1923-2004 becomes a vital source, even though this source is by and large an abridged version of the more comprehensive and expensive masterpiece work of Hana Batatu, The Old Social Classes and the Revolutions of Iraq.<br /><br />The book starts by telling the story of the formation of the first Marxist group in Iraq in the early 20th century. It goes on to narrate the history of the leftist movement which gave birth to one of the once most influential communist party in the Arab world, the Iraqi Communist Party.<br /><br />Salucci, however, doesn't establish a specified pattern in telling his story. At times he quotes original literature while at other times he simply cites Batatu. Salucci's analysis of events and his methodology employed in writing the history of Iraqi communists are either absent or weak, seemingly due to a weakness in Arabic and Arab affairs in general.<br /><br />Furthermore, Salucci often fails to put the history of Iraq's communists in a greater regional or Arab context. Yet he succeeds in tracing the history of the communist relations with other Iraqi factions, especially the ruling Baath Party, an ultra-nationalist pan-Arab group. It would have been interesting; however, had Salucci been able to highlight the relations between the communists and other Iraqi groups at the time, especially the Shiite religious establishment.<br /><br />Parts of the book deal with the past changes in the party's ideology and platform aimed mainly at consoling the communist ideology with its power-seeking trip and justifying the short periods during which it joined the Baathist government. This ideological-political schism ultimately led some from the communist leadership to give up on their own comrades and hand their names to the brutal Baathist intelligence in return for some seats in Saddam Hussein's puppet cabinet.<br /><br />This act of collaboration on the part of the communist leadership in 1969, headed by its secretary general at the time Abdul-Aziz Hajj, led to an infamous Baathist purge of communists.<br /><br />Later in the book, Salucci unfairly and inaccurately tries to connect the Iraqi left today to the opposition against the American 2003 war and later presence in Iraq. This is a fallacy as the Iraqi Communist Party, which ran for parliamentary elections in January 2005 independently and won two seats, repeatedly expressed its approval of the American presence there.<br /><br />Finally, the author's style is mostly dull and rarely attractive.

The words \\"Real Story\\" implies that the writer at least provides an accurate account about the unfolding events, which he doesn't. The words \\"the War in Iraq\\" give the impression that David was there during the last days of the regime when America launched its Operation Iraqi Freedom. He wasn't.<br /><br />David Enders, a college student in his senior year, went to Beirut to finish his BA but then interrupted his semester to go to Baghdad a month after its liberation and the downfall of the Saddam Hussain regime on April 9, 2003. Deciding to embark on a journalistic project, the little-experienced English Major graduate of the University of Michigan and a group of like-minded, young and in-experienced friends decided to start a publication, the Baghdad Bulletin. David was its editor.<br /><br />Meeting him in Baghdad at the time, it took me no time to discover that David's background about the Middle East in general and Iraq in particular was minimal. His Arabic was even worse, a fact which made him, like most other foreign reporters in Iraq, depend on native translators with their less-than-average English, in order to get a feel of things.<br /><br />True David was courageous enough to tour different parts of the country, but at the time when he was able to do that, all other foreign and American journalists where also able to do it. In order to avoid anachronism, we have to keep in mind that violence in Iraq - in its current form of an anti-American insurgency - erupted at least six months after liberation. This makes of the first period of David's stay in Baghdad relatively calm, but not safe of the insecurity due mainly to post April 9 organized crime and looting.<br /><br />David's lack of background and language made him report on Iraqi events from the perspective of a complete stranger, often copyediting pieces that he published in his magazine rather than editing them for content verification.<br /><br />David's weakness is evident in his book, Baghdad Buletin, which is more of a reporter's diary, with the exception that the background information provided is often erroneous. A good example is his confusion between Mohammed Baker Al-Sadr, the founder of the Islamic Daawa Party, who the Baathists killed in 1980 and Mohammed Sadeq Al-Sadr, the father of today's famous young cleric Muqtada.<br /><br />David's style, however, is attractive.

The book traces the origins of the formation of political Shiism (Shiites are the second major faction in Islam after main stream Sunnis) in Iraq.<br /><br />Abdul-Jabbar argues with skill that the evolution of the institutions of this sect was closely tied to the unfolding political events in the region starting with Ottoman Iraq, followed by the period of the formation of the Iraqi nation-state under the Hashemite monarchy toppled in 1958, and ending with the rule of the Baathist regime which lasted until 2003.<br /><br />Even though this first edition includes an updated introduction covering the role of the Shiites in the Iraqi opposition movement outside of Iraq and the downfall of the Baathist regime, the book was clearly written while the Baathists were still in power. This makes it especially imperative for the author to print an updated second edition with an appendix that highlights the role of the Shiites and their religious leadership in post Baath Iraq.<br /><br />The book is also an excellent encyclopedic document recording the creation of Iraqi Shiite parties and prominent figures and puting them in their greater Middle Eastern context as it includes brief information on Iranian and Lebanese Shiites. The book, however, leaves the Shiites of Eastern Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in the dark.<br /><br />The Shiite Movement in Iraq also documents the formation of the first militant Shiite movement the Islamic Daawa Party, which first engaged in theoretical debates with the Iraqi Communists and was later bitterly oppressed by the Baathists. The book also talks about the evolution of the institution of the Marja' (the highest ranking Shiite ayatollah), its centralization and decentralization, its legitimacy and the religious-temporal relations in leading the Shiites. Most importantly, Abdul-Jabbar describes the procession of the Shiite rituals such as Ashura and the Arba'een and traces the origins of the people who sponsor these events and who perform them.<br /><br />Abdul-Jabar's includes a fortune of names, dates and references to Shiite cultural events.

She stood up for her beliefs as she ended the male monopoly of all kinds of military activity in the oriental societies.<br /><br />Suha, a supporter of the Lebanese Communist Party, was recruited during the days of Israeli occupation of Lebanon to assassinate her compatriot, Antoine Lahad, who defected from the army and formed his own pro-Israeli militia known as the South Lebanese Army (SLA).<br /><br />The assassination attempt failed and Suha was eventually detained and taken to the notorious Khiam Prison, where SLA detectives tortured their subjects causing the death of many of them. Evidently Suha survived.<br /><br />The book is written in a chronological context and is concluded by the time Suha was released in 1998. It would have been very much in place, however, had Suha decided to look back at her violent activity and her decade in prison and gave her assessment in retrospect. Suha claims that her violent experience later changed her into a peacenik while her stay in prison taught her the love of life and patience.<br /><br />Despite the drawback, the book is a primary source and a firsthand account of a witness who once contributed to the making of news in Lebanon and Israel in the 1980s.<br /><br />Suha's book brings to the forefront the perspective of a silent South Lebanese population that had lived under Israeli occupation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is very little literature about what these southern Lebanese locals thought and believed at the time away from the divergent claims and perspectives of the two contending parties mainly Israel and Hizbullah. This volume covers particularly this area.	2005-04-12

This time, Tom Friedman comes to us with one of his brilliant books that puts the United States in its economic, scientific, social and political world context.<br /><br />It has been always that Americans define their relations with the world viewing their country as a remote island with interests in every corner of the earth. Friedman, however, brings this old view to reality and warns Americans that past glory is never enough to build future might.<br /><br />As always, Friedman's style is very attractive and perhaps the most entertaining among writers. His sharp observation and wit adds flavor to a well-organized, displayed and packaged richness of information.<br /><br />The book is worth every cent you spend on it. Buy it now!	2005-04-10

When I first bought this book I thought it would be a description of the genesis and evolution of the Baath Party and the Syrian dictatorship that ultimately led to poverty and suppression of human rights.<br /><br />Instead, the book talks about a brief period when the current Syrian President Bashar Assad succeeded his father Hafez in 2000. The period witnessed a surge in Syrian hopes that their young president had intentions to modernize the regime and the state and allow more freedom, only to discover later that Hazfez Assad's old guard heavy weights cracked heavily on the few figures who dared criticize the regime and call for its modernization.<br /><br />The author is clearly informed about this civil movement and its leaders, yet his description of these people is sometimes misleading as he tends to depict them as freedom lovers whereas in fact, many of the Syrian \\"civil insurgents\\" are just nationalists who think that the regime has failed in winning regional Arab battles and would love to see a stronger one replace it.<br /><br />This is particularly misleading for Western readers who might confuse these opposition activists for pro-West at the time they are in fact very much anti-West.<br /><br />The style of the book is \\"slow and dry,\\" and gets boring at times. The writer should have spiced up his manuscript with figurative description of the Syrian capital and the people whom he interviewed.	2005-04-09

This meant that these parties shifted on the political spectrum from the left to the left-center.<br /><br />The chapters are thorough, descriptive and insightful and even though the different authors offer different writing styles, some studies in this book are attractive and entertaining while other chapters are dull and boring.<br /><br />Readers will particularly enjoy the story of leftist failure in the US, where post World War II prosperity hindered the evolution of the concept of society. This individualism was emulated in England under Conservative premier Margaret Thatcher in the 80s. Magi became famous for her statement: \\"There is no society, only individuals,\\" in reference to her rightist party's stance against the social welfare state.<br /><br />The rightist leadership of England extended for most of the 1980s and 90s until the Conservative Party's several mistakes, coupled with the leftist Labor Party's \\"reconsideration\\" of itself leading to its transformation into the New Labor, brought Labor to power. When in power, the leftist English party moved away from leftism and the welfare state toward what it depicted as a \\"Third Way\\" style of governorship, which included more liberal economic policies.<br /><br />But such a shift was not easy in France, where despite the Socialist Party's implementation of rightist economic policies starting the mid 1980s, the socialists could not express out loud their adoption of more center-leftist policies for the fear that their strong communist allies might abandon them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in Germany the social democrats endorsed \\"Third Way\\" policies and came to power.<br /><br />In Poland, the disbanded Communist Party transformed itself into a Social Democratic Party and won over the Solidarity Movement, known for its freedom fighting under the communists before 1989. The reason for this leftist victory, the book argues, was the virtual inexistence of the middle-class which traditionally supports rightist parties and their market economy theses.<br /><br />In Russia, the underdeveloped political culture has been unable to sustain majoritarian politics. Therefore, social democracy failed facing a dominant popular political culture based on a clientele network and favoritism penetrating the state bureaucracy.<br /><br />The volume ends with a concise conclusion by the book's editor Erwin Hargrove.

Coughlin did a marvelous job in documenting them and putting them together.<br /><br />The book highlights Saddam's mastery of fist-fighting at first, which compensated his little intellect and political ability. That was one of the main reasons why the Baath Party's founders and mentors took him under their wing and elevated him to the highest of position: Saddam was ready and willing to terrorize others on behalf of the Baath and impose a harsh rule.<br /><br />Eventually, Saddam, a hard worker fascinated by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, eliminated his own comrades and even family members. The book shows the downward way of Saddam and his family which ultimately led to their political isolation, the destruction of Iraq and finally hi own deposition.	2005-02-23

Even though Said Aburish expresses his admiration of Nasser toward the beginning of the book, a statement which warns the reader of a biased account in favor of Nasser, the book eventually proves to be otherwise.<br /><br />According to Aburish, Nasser was a popular leader only and had no vision, platform or plan for the Arab world. Aburish correctly argues that Nasser had two positive sides only to his leadership: The first is that Nasser was never corrupt and the second is that his dictatorship depended mostly on his charisma.<br /><br />Nasser didn't live a luxurious life or eliminate his earlier comrades after he took over the Egyptian rule. Nasser's single-mindedness in decision-making, however, dominated his leadership. This rare influence depended on an undisputed leadership drawing mainly on Nasser's popularity and charisma.<br /><br />Through a narration covering Nasser's life since his early days, Aburish leaves then his reader to judge whether an incompetent popular leader with no platform was needed at that period of Arab history or not.<br /><br />The book is also a good read for all those who are interested in exploring the history of Egypt and the Arab world between the late 1940s and 1970.<br /><br />In terms of style, Aburish presents an easy going and attractive narrative. His sources and research are, by and large, credible.<br /><br />Certainly several pro-Arab nationalism reviewers will find Aburish's book not credible, but whoever wants to dispute this account should provide a better one instead of employing emotions only in criticizing this work.	2005-02-23

The first part criticizes the American war on Iraq saying that it was uncalled for and waged by people driven by their personal interests more than their claims of defending<br />America against the danger of terrorism. In the second part, Khalidi highlighted the failure of British and France to colonize most of the Arab world saying that behind this failure, there was popular determination to win independence.<br />In this part, historian Khalidi committed a lot of anachronisms. He failed to put what he termed the national struggle in its greater regional and international context. Was the Palestinian revolution against the British out of national motives or was it instigated by the growing power of the axis countries that were trying to win back colonies they had lost to<br />Britain and France in WWI?<br />Khalidi's emotional description of what he sees as struggle for national sovereignty is perhaps the only drawback in his book. Khalidi then moves to describe the growth of relations between the United States and the Arab world ever since the 1919 post WWI Versailles Conference delegated what came to be known as the King-Crane Commission to learn about the Arab peoplesÕ whishes.<br />The committee astoundingly founded that Arabs thought, if mandate was their only option, they would go for American mandate. The Arab perspective of America changed drastically, however, especially with the growing interest of American oil firms in the region.<br />The anti-American Arab sentiment grew even further with America heavily interfering in favor of the Israelis in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<br />According to Khalidi, the United States failed to deliver all the promises that it would pressure Israel to stop its aggressive policy of settlement of Palestinian land during Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.<br />Khalidi also fell heavily on late Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat accusing him of sabotaging the peace process in favor of his personal interests and the interests of his corrupt entourage.i, the United States failed to deliver all the promises that it would pressure Israel to stop its aggressive policy of settlement of Palestinian land during Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.

US	19986219	R1GLSRFB9O0SIX	0385413726	244095611	From Beirut to Jerusalem	Books	5	6	11	N	Y	A great read	Tom Friedman has many assets. First, his sense of observation is exellent, second, his style is very entertaining, and third, he was a very hard working reporter who has many stories to share.<br /><br />While many might think that the book is outdated, I believe many of its arguments still stand. Even with the Lebanese civil war that Friedman describes now over, the Lebanese society is still divided over the same issues and, more or less, along the same lines Friedman describes.<br /><br />The second part of the book, which talks about Friedman's stay in Jerusalem, is also reflective of the current Israeli situation. Israelis still struggle to define what kind of nation they are and inside which boundaries they should live.<br /><br />Reading between the lines, anyone can tell that Fridman is a peace advocate, trying to highlight fear and frustration on both sides (the Arab and the Israeli) and the willingness to live in peace among most people of both nations.<br /><br />I've heard many Middle Eastern academics criticizing this book and undermining its importance. On top of those was late Columbia University Palestinian-American professor Edward Said, who accuses Friedman of orientalism, a term he coined that undermines the credibility of Western writers who claim to be an authority on Eastern issues. While Said might have some point in his accusations, he should have still given some credit to a book full of details. As an Arab, I'd say that for most parts of the book, Friedman's description was fair and accurate.<br /><br />Friedman's From Beirut to Jerusalem has become a classic work, and I believe there is much reason for that. This is Friedman's best work, all readers interested in the Middle East should buy this book and read it.	2005-01-16

It is a quick survey that gives background information about most of the players, whether international, regional or domestic.<br /><br />The account is concise, however, and sacrifices some details for the sake of brevity and coherence. Rabinovich's style is rich and attractive. For readers familiar with the Middle East, the book would serve as a fresh reminder and wouldn't take more than a couple of evening to finish.<br /><br />Another drawback is that the book covers the period 1975-1984 without covering the rest of the civil war that ended on 1990. Perhaps an updated version with the war's conclusion and perhaps some analysis of the aftermath of the war are currently needed.<br /><br />If you are looking for the history of the Lebanese civil war, this book is the one you are looking for. If you want some more history of the war, get Kamal Salibi's A House of Many Mansions as a supplement. Between the two books, you would have a complete and comprehensive idea of the Lebanese modern politics and its history.	2005-01-12

It's a book of life, putting most of the things that it discusses in context. Just wish that politicians and policy makers start taking such books into consideration and abandon the prejudice of their advisors who always wish to call themselves experts on issues they barely know about.<br /><br />Diamond is well-informed.

To many readers, this book might look boring and excessively academic. But to other readers, especially those who are interested in taking a deep look into the history of the Middle East in general and the Ottoman Empire in particular, this is one of the must-read books.<br /><br />The book is full of details of the Ottoman bureaucracy, the Janissaries (the army), conspiracies among rulers and would sultans, the social status of the different people of the empires and of course the Ottoman political situation and that of its treasury.<br /><br />For those interested in modern Turkish history, this might not be their best read as it highlights the history of the Ottomans up until the days of the zenith of their rule. The book does not go as far as depicting how the Muslim Ottoman Empire was transformed into the sick Turkish man of Europe.<br /><br />Overall, the book is highly recommended for readers interested in Middle Eastern affairs.	2005-01-12

It is a failing attempt to imitate Tom Friedman's From Beirut to Jerusalem. It is full of mistakes. Don't waste your money or your time buying it and reading it.<br /><br />To illustrate what I mean by full of mistakes; take the chapter that discusses Lebanon, for instance.<br /><br />The author talks about Iranians teaching children martyrdom in Shiite schools in South Lebanon. How could Persian-speaking Iranians communicate with Arabic-speaking Shiite youngsters? The author doesn't seem to be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />This is not to belittle Iran's role in building Hizbullah in Lebanon, but Judith got it all with a wrong reasoning. She knows most of what happened, but she can barely explain why this did happen. When she comes up with words of wisdom, they prove to be unfit.<br /><br />Another drawback in this book is Miller's assumption or her targeting of an audience that is not familiar with the Middle East at all. Whatever issue she mentions, she gives loads of quick surveys as background information. This becomes boring while the information she provides seem shallow for readers familiar with the Middle East.<br /><br />Finally, even though Miller has a good journalistic style, such a style doesn't necessarily look good when writing a book that is a mixture of history and politics of a region with the biggest number of versions of the most complicated stories of the world's history.	2005-01-11

Patai is a genius. His book is by far the best in this respect.<br /><br />For Arab readers: Read the book and in no time you'll find yourselves putting names to the abundant examples Patai cites.<br /><br />The book deals with several interesting traits that most Arabs share in their inherent characters. These include the Arab unawareness of time, their tendency to speak more than they can actually deliver, their fixation with sex and their keenness to preserve Bedouin values which include preserving a group's honor by preserving the chastity of its female members.<br /><br />Even though the book is academic, the style is entertaining as it alternates between theories and real life examples to illustrate them.<br /><br />The book, a classic, is certainly worth a read.

Saudis had the most archaic society on the face of earth at the time they received the biggest fortune ever.<br /><br />Readers might be also surprised to learn that the ruling Saudi family is almost exclusively composed of the sons of the founder and their sons. Another surprising remark the author makes is that, even with the huge budget this kingdom manages, it still has no treasury department.<br /><br />Not very surprising, however, is the typical third world behavior of Saudi rulers who squandered their suddenly generated fortunes either to buy political loyalties or for self luxury.<br /><br />The reader might be amazed at how many chances the Saudis have missed to modernize their country and make use of their once unparalleled wealth. Instead, they protected anti-modernization fundamental groups on which the stay of the regime itself depended.	2004-10-18

His book offers a historic background of this conflict, the version of each party and the diplomacy buildup that sometimes led to breakthroughs in peacemaking and in other times reached the brink of peace but later stalled.<br /><br />The book is unnecessarily long (872 pages), but is entertaining as it includes anecdotal details and some other less important details about how Ross boarded planes and took showers prior to his meetings.<br /><br />The book also sheds light on how, on several occasions, arrogance, pride, prejudice, electoral considerations and pulling diplomatic stunts to muster further support of followers have always affected peace negotiations.<br /><br />It also shows that terrorists and other anti-peace factions succeeded in so many instances in delaying peaceful efforts and in other instances completely sabotaged them.<br /><br />Ross has been a witness of the diplomatic effort between Israelis and Arabs, which was interrupted in 2000. His book is certainly a reference document for all those interested in taking a deeper look into the Middle East conflict and international attempts at resolving it.	2004-10-18

It includes recommendations on how the young should renew their interest in politics so that they can pressure their representatives, who are according to Peterson, are only interested in short term solutions that secure them votes at the expense of probable solutions for America's colossally increasing debt problem. He believes the unwillingness of the nation's leaders to stand up to face such a challanege fearing that unpopular solutions would cost them their popularity, would only delay the problem and hand it over to future generations.<br /><br />The book is enlightening, but probably belongs to an older school of economics. While Peterson, for instance, writes that the government is not well prepared to pay Social Security and Medicare to baby boomers due to retire in 2008, he does not notice that the retirement of admittedly America's most numerous generation will also create vast job opportunities for their replacements and that taxes of those who will be filling their gaps would certainly be helpful.<br /><br />Even though the book is not academic, it includes figures that would make it irrelevant in a while. If you are into economics and sociology, buy it now before the numbers are old.	2004-10-07

Employing his sharp analytical skills and his perfection of semitic languages, Salibi provides an interpretation of parts of the Old Testament that is by far, different from most of the versions that we've read or heard.<br /><br />This is the second book based on Salibi's hypothesis which has it that the events of the Old Testament did not happen in Palestine but rather took place in the slopes of Hijaz and Assir (in today's Saudi Arabia).<br /><br />His first book in which he unveiled his new theory is the Bible Came from Arabia, which appeared in the early 80s.<br /><br />Unlike what a reader might expect, the style of the book is attractive and contains a lot of Salibi's wit, which draws the non-historian reader away from boredom.<br /><br />The book is a classic.

His ability to analyse old languages gave him the supremacy in putting the stories of the Old testament in a proper and logical context. When you read Salibi's new version of Samuel 1 and 2, you feel that you need to run his critique over all other books of the Old Testament. Salibi himself has applied his academic approach to many other parts of the Old Testament. When believers of the Church harshly criticized Salibi's new readings, he answered that he writes what he believes to be historically true away from matters of faith.

Second, the Israelis never intended to recognize the Palestinian leadership as the representative of the Arabs residing in the occupied territories. Instead, it opted for trying to deal with the Jordanian leadership as the representative of these Palestinians and using a policy of an iron fist with them.<br /><br />An articulate Aburish argues that the peace process was born dead for three main reasons. Arafat's tribal behavior and corruption made him impose his leadership on the Palestinians living in the territories whereas the real leadership was offered by the residents themselves such as Al-Shafi, Ashrawi and Husseini. Second, the Israeli never stopped creating new realities by constantly expanding their settlements in Palestinian territories and errecting new ones, a situation which made the Palestinians always doubtful of the Israeli true intentions toward a durable peace.<br /><br />While Arafat believed that some Israeli concessions would beef up his leadership after he was ejected from Beirut in 1982 and lived since then in Tunisian exile, Israel thought that with minimum concessions it could force Arafat to police and supress the Palestinians living under occupation.<br /><br />The end result (not in the book), was the collapse of the peace process and an increase in violence, which creates a bleak picture of the future of peace and makes both the Palestinians and the Israelis head into oblivion.	2004-09-24

Salibi draws historical parallels and argues that Jesus, coming from a royal Jewish line in Arabia, the seat of Jewish historic events, came to Palestine to lay claim over his sovereignty over the Jewish people. He said that by the time of Jesus, Jews had considerably emmigrated from Arabia and established a prosperous community in Palestine.<br /><br />Jesus' bid, however, disturbed the status quo of the Jewish establishment and made the influential among them demand that the Romans crucify him.<br /><br />Not aware at first of the original story, Paul started preaching his line of Christianity, which eventually made him fall out with the rest of Jesus' closest followers. Salibi concludes that Paul's version of Christianity ultimately prevailed and contributed to shaping the religion in the way that we know it today.	2004-09-24

I've also seen Woodward several times on TV, but I didnt see anyone bringing this important piece of information to the fore.<br /><br />For some reason, the author failed to convince me, as a reader, that his reporting was based on accurate information. The book looks as if it was put together in a rush, lacks a table of contents and chapters are without titles.<br /><br />The book's other narratives about the Saudi ambassador Prince Bandor invited to check the plan of attack on Iraq before Secretary of State Colin Powel is interesting. Overall, the book depicts the whole of the Bush administration, save for Powell, as people who had a second agenda behind the war on Iraq and who were pre-determined to topple the Iraqi dictator with or without 9/11 and with or without Saddam Hussein's posession of WMDs.	2004-09-24

It's a clearer and more authentic version of Moore's documentary Fahrenheit 9/11.<br />The style is entertaining as the author shifts between terrorists' preparations and the history of the evolution of America's clandestine information-gathering agencies. Graham cites more than a dozen failures, which he says were missed chances to unfold the most evil of attacks on American soil ever.<br />The depiction of the 19 terrorists does not only show that these were brainwashed mostly under-25 kids, but also reflects how they were not as smart as many of us thought. They left a trace everywhere and many of them were repeatedly stopped and ticketed for overspeed driving. This highlights even more the failure of America's security people whose lack of coordination, bureaucracy and laziness made them fail to notice the stark danger.<br />Graham then describes how the administration had a preset agenda, which did not match the nation's security welfare but rather confirmed with the interests of some businessmen/politicians whose oversees interests mandated that they protect their overseas partners who happened to be - in one way or another - sponsors of these terrorists<br />The administration therefore politicized its response to 9/11 and squandered resources over the Iraq war instead of concentrating its energy on the Afghanistan war and counterterrorism.<br />The book is one of the best on this subject. Being an Arab myself, I think it should be translated to Arabic and exported to Arab countries since most Arabs still perceive of the 9/11 tragedy as the biggest conspiracy which they never committed but was malevolently ascribed to them as part of an effort to tarnish the reputation of Islam and invade Muslims countries.	2004-09-23

In the heyday of a never ending debate about the identity of the Lebanese people, an objective historical record is highly needed.<br />Several Maronite historians should understand that they do not come from a different ethnic stock. They must thoroughly read their historical texts and subject them to historical analysis. Maronite history has become similar to a religious faith: it is not receptive of any historical examination.<br />Salibi does not favor one group more than another in this book. He only classifies groups according to the available texts and what he gets in conclusion is a different story about the history of Lebanon which might be sad, but true.<br />The anonymous reviewer who scorns Salibi for this book is apparently writing with the current political situation (the Syrians influencing Lebanese politics) in the back of his mind. This kind of review is what historians call biased history. Salibi never suggests that Lebanon must become a Syrian province, the reviewer reached to this conclusion by him/herself.	2004-09-23

On the one hand, it documents one of the biggest military adventures in the Middle East while on the other hand, it is a lesson for Western leaders who intend to use military might to change political realities in the region.<br /><br />According to the book, this military adventure consumed itself and its engineer then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, who circumvented Israel's democracy by withholding information about his true plan of invasion from Israeli politicians then unsuccessfully meddling in Lebanese internal politics.<br /><br />The book is a survey of rapidly unfolding military events and a deep analysis into their immediate political consequences.<br /><br />Since the book was published shortly after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the authors should consider publishing an updated version that should cover the period of Israeli occupation thereafter and the consequent withdrawal in 2000.<br /><br />The authors display mastery in understanding the mosaic picture of Lebanese politics. They also succeed in painting an accurate portray of Sharon, the General/politician who always called for a military solution for the Middle East's conflict. This, however, proved to be much more complicated than to be solved in an Israeli blitzkrieg strike against Lebanon in 1982.<br /><br />The book also sheds a light on the determined and shrewd personality of late Syrian dictator Hafez Assad who succeeded, as in most complicated issues that faced him, in prevailing victoriously. Assad simply displayed more skill in understanding Arab politics than his Israeli counter parts, a fact whose end result was the complete Syrian domination of Lebanon, more than two decades after Israel's Lebanon war.<br /><br />American policy makers behind the liberation of Iraq should read this book in order to refresh their memory on Arab politics and remind themselves of the magnitude of regional intervention of neighboring Arab countries in Iraq affairs.	2004-09-09

Even though the book was published in 2001, research and interviews were done much earlier, in mid 1990s.<br /><br />Everyone who enjoys reading about Lebanon, or for that matter, the Middle East and the Arab-Israeli relations, should read this book. The author strips the story of Jews in Arab countries from myth and puts it in a new context which has it that the Jewish community in Lebanon, like the other remaining faith groups, prospered as the country prospered and dwindeled with the nation's diminishing fortunes.<br /><br />Despite the author's apparent Jewish roots, objectivity runs high in the book and Schulze knew perfectly well when to describe the Lebanese Jews as aloof  from Zionism and when to report on the single incident of aleviating non-Lebanese Israeli sympathy that led to spying in Israel's favor.<br /><br />Finally, it felt sad that some Lebanese Muslim radicals kidnapped and killed 11 of their Jewish compatriots. This savagery stands as a proof to the amount of radicalism that small nations like Lebanon imported from regional neigbors like Iran. This imported policy reached to the extent that one deputy, Najah Wakim, accused Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of striking partnerships with Edmond Safra, a Lebanese Jew, as a sign of pro-Israeli collaboration. Wakim is a well-known Syrian puppit.	2004-09-06

Kipel traces the origins of Muslim radical movements in all of the Islamic countries and highlights the circumstances that diverted them from theological preaching to violent activity.<br /><br />From the very beginning, Kipel offers a unique analysis saying that the events of 9/11 signaled the end of Islamic terrorism and not its climax since militant Muslim groups felt compelled to win some attention among fellow Muslims by embarking on a grandiose terror activity, but to no avail.<br /><br />Kipel also tells of the reaction of the different regimes to these movements. At the time some rulers quenched Muslim radical groups and systematically destroyed them later, other sovereigns contained them or even used them to consolidate their rule.<br /><br />The book has a peculiarly interesting entry about the Muslim community in Europe and describes its growth and eventual politicization.<br /><br />Fitting this voluminous information into a single book, however, meant that Kipel had to sacrifice other pieces of info. When describing the relations of these movements with foreign - regional and international groups - the book only provides a quick narration of the CIA support of Muslim Mujahideen in their war in Afghanistan against the Soviets.<br /><br />In other Muslim countries that witnessed a rise in militant Islamic activity, relations of these groups were put only in their domestic context.<br /><br />The book also offers a unique analysis of the Islamic movement as it ties its dynamics, in a Marxist manner, to the relations between the different social classes and their socioeconomic circumstances, especially the always rising unemployment.	2004-09-06

The reader should take into account, however, that the book is written from the Israeli perspective only. This is not to undermine the objectivity of the writer but only to say that, since Rabinovich is a reporter, he should have given more space for the Egyptian and Syrian sides of the story.<br /><br />Even though the author has apparently read books by Arab authors on the subject, as he tells the stories, Israeli soldiers seem to have names, homes, families and businesses while Arab troops are mostly nameless, homeless and a reader can only imagine them as evil soldiers that one usually encounter in a Play Station game arcade.<br /><br />Granted Arab regimes do not give access to any kind of valuable material on the subject, but certainly some more effort, or perhaps an Arab co-author interviewing some of the Arab war survivers, would have produced a more comprehensive book that covers both sides of the story.	2004-08-24
