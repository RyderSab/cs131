Personally, I like it because I'm reading for the vampires and werewolves instead of the kissy, touchy, die without you stuff.  This book takes the reader further into the world of the werewolves, its social structure, and its politics (female protagonist = werewolf).  At the same time, the male protagonist is a vampire \\"enforcer\\" who lives on the fringes of his society.    These characters work together and become physically entangled as they try to solve a series of mysterious murders involving a killer or killers leaving DNA on the victims that is both were and vamp.	2005-09-13

It features three sisters, two brothers and associates from the brother's school days.  A few historical errors aside, it is an entertaining story.  Without giving too much away, things may not be what they seem when the eldest and youngest Cabot sisters join their enchanting and socially perfect middle sister in London to meet her suitor.  The language is cleaver and there are a couple of cute twists and turns.  Overall, the book is a good, quick read.	2005-09-13

Since they are being reprinted after so many years, can I possibly hope for more?   Soon?  The setting and tone of this book differs dramatically from that of \\"Burning Water.\\"  In this book, Di is back on her own turf.  Readers see more of her past, which makes her character even more interesting.  Instead of purposely walking into trouble, trouble finds her. Throw in 3 types of vampires, can you go wrong?  The third book is Jinx High, which is also scheduled to be re-released by Tor.	2005-08-24

It opens with the primary protagonist awakes among a slaughtered caravan without any memory of her past.  As the novel progresses, she gradually learns more about her past as well as the past of the traveling companions she encounters in the woods and town nearby.  It really is a good story.  Two issues though.  The first is that Archer smacks of Aragon of the Dunedin.  The second is the epilogue.  This is a Luna book. We know there is another one coming.  Skip the cheesy epilogue. It made me feel like I was reading some book keyed to junior high readers. It also seems to (poorly) pay homage to Tolkien in the \\"we will all journey with you to the end\\" sort of way (ref the aftermath of Frodo agreeing to take the ring to Mordor).  Cheesy though, \\"The myths of old had claimed their fates.  Prophecies spoken.  Destinies set.  They could only hope the were fit for the burden.\\"  Could we please be a little less obvious?  Just skip the epilogue.	2005-08-19

There is some romance, but instead of a very physically romance, it is humorous and witty mixed in with a few kisses and a few glimpses of flesh (without graphic detail).  The Ulrich likes what he sees and is obvious (vocal) about it much sooner in the story than Gossamyr.  Gossamyr is interesting in that she is both able to take care of herself, yet she is out of place without being in Faery.  Ulrich is much the opposite.  They are drawn to travel together to Paris, and each with their own missions.  The character interaction is very entertaining.  The introduction into the next book of the series isn't annoyingly obvious (yeah!).	2005-08-19

Needless to say, I really like Fallon's work, and I am tired of waiting for these books to be released in paperback in the US.  Harshini was just released in hardcover in July.  Medalon is an engaging story that progresses well with characters, both likable and not, are well developed.  One thing I really like about Fallon, she doesn't leave the reader hanging for months or even years.  Her books have endings even though they are still part of a definite series.	2005-08-13

There are parts that are really good, cleaver, and interested.  On the other hand, there are parts that dragged and it didn't seem to truly finish although there was resolution.  At this point, there is no reason for any other author to move over.   Also, my experience may have been different from some of the other reviewers since I read the sequel directly following Nylon Angel.  I recommend that other readers do so as well.  The story ties together much more readily.  The extra star is for reading it with the second book.	2005-08-13

So, eager to see what she could do with two of my favorite groups (wide representation applied) of people (Toltec/Mayan/Aztec civilizations and Scandinavian raider culture) the book was purchased.  Jaguar and the Wolf just doesn't seem to go anywhere or to have a clear purpose or reason for being written.  There is little character development, growth, plot, etc... Although there are some interesting parts, for the most part it lacks the history and thoughtfulness seen in Paper Mage.     They can't all be good reviews...	2005-08-13

Although is could be read on its own as Ms. Klausner's remarked, a reader would miss a lot of the small details that truly support the story without reading the first novel.  The series is set in a fictional reality in what would be our Middle East complete with all of the trappings of the decadent life of the rich supporting themselves on the backs of slaves and what amounts to as indentured servitude.  Incase you missed them, please read Naomi Kritzer' s Fires of the Faithful (2002) and Turning the Storm (2003).	2005-08-13

This particular installment in the series explores the vampires and demons in more detail than the previous books while mostly avoiding, yet managing to include a bit more elf and more were as well.  It hardly delves deeply into the elven mystery, but it does provide some clues as to what may come next.  It was a little disappointing to have Rachel \\"hook-up\\" so soon after Nick's little vacation, and I missed some of the human/tomato interactions present in the Good the Bad and the Undead (my favorite of the series so far).  BTW, the use of \\"caps\\" is really, pardon the word,  cute.	2005-08-13

Although I dearly loved the first two books of this series and am a great fan of her 'Rai-Kirah' series (didn't care much for Song of the Beast), but this book falls apart at the seams.  The action is disjointed and the book feels sloppy.  To tell you the truth, I rather wondered if Carol Berg had died or was sick and someone else wrote into an outline for this book that they found lying around her house.  It feels as if someone else wrote this book.  At this point Daughter of Ancients (book 4 of the series September 2005) appears to be a risky venture. <br /> <br />They can't all be good reviews...	2005-08-13

It's almost a disservice to the book to have \\"Signet Eclipse Paranormal Romance\\" stamped on the side, because I know a number of men who would like this book.

Hoping that Rusch hadn't finally let me down, I read it last night.  The book is as good as the rest of the series.   I'm just not sure that the other reviewers have read the rest of the series.  Personally, I like the Retrieval Artist books because humans aren't the biggest bad in the galaxy. Humans in these books have to try to get along and work around the cultural hang-ups located in alien cultures while trying to maintain our own nature and culture.  Humans in these books work with (or around- hence the need for the Retrieval Artist) the alien cultures and try to respect them (within reason- therein lays the conflict or narrative hook necessary for a good book) and not just saying the universe is wrong and humans are always right (or we will blow you up).	2005-07-25

Although I would have loved to have seen another book set in the world of Tinker, this book presents an interesting world as well and the first of her books that I have read that has nothing to do with Pennsylvania.  The story is interesting because it is set in a place where women far out number men, and where women manage all aspects of society and men are sheltered, pampered,  and the primary care giver for of the children.  There are aspects of war, intrigue, fantasy, and romance wrapped up in the 310 pages of this novel.	2005-07-16

Set in a small southern town were everyone knows what you ate for breakfast, they introduce us to a world where synthetic blood has let vampires out of the closet.  The heroine is a little psychic and the neighboring town is overly fuzzy.  The fuzzy come in different shades from dog to wolf and including some felines.  Actually, the only thing not to like about this book is the fact that Ace Books decided to publish it in hardcover after the first three were in paperback. Having to wait a year to own a published book is annoying when you have no room or money to spend for a hardback!  This is a \\"to own\\" book to me, and not a library read.  Hopefully the next one hits paperback quicker than this one, I almost forgot that I wanted to read it. <br />	2005-06-17

This book is a delightful mix of monster, mystery, myth, and mayhem.  Although it is sold as a romance, there are very little of the \\"normal trappings\\" of that genre.  The sex is minimized in favor of advancing the plot and when it does come up, sex doesn't occur at the expense of the rest of the story.  The links to Native America are excellent.

This book does things a little bit different.  The life altering change takes place fairly early in the story, and the characters spend the rest of the book both dealing with that change and dealing with the events that made the change necessary.  As always, both this author's characters and story are well defined and executed in a fantasy world.  This time that world mixes humans with elves and other magical creatures while maintaining the illusion of the world we know in addition to a world of mythical proportions.	2005-06-17

What starts as a cop story quickly delves into some political intrigue as Rachel (station police) finds herself in the middle of a number of odd incidences in a station where odd is an everyday occurrence.

Although the first book is my favorite, the series doesn't disappoint.  The Ancient Legacy brings back more of the fighting sequences and history that were present in the Fifth Ring.  The interesting thing about these books is that there is no really strong protagonist.  Instead, the author has created a coterie of equally developed characters that tend to share the lime-light.  The sword fighting scenes are still very strong.	2005-06-16

Its also not I style that appears to be common in the romance genre.  Her heroines tend to be the simpering sort and the heroes can be almost as misogynistic or at least overbearing as the villains.

The author has done a very good job of creating a believable world.  The story combines elements of war, politics, social interaction, hiding, and the evitable chase.  Although it is similar to a number of other \\"high fantasy\\" series, it is different enough to be very enjoyable.  The main protagonist is a young girl hidden through her childhood to protect her from her half brother.  Although the characters are young, this book may not be appropriate for some younger readers.  Although not extremely graphic, there are instances that are both violent and sexual. Some of this may increase as the main characters age throughout the series.	2005-06-16

However, I believe that is a book that deserves a wider audience, but the author has limited its readability by adding some disjointed elements.  I picked it up in the science fiction section and was disappointed in the romance elements.  It is not that those elements were bad, but they seemed to hold up the story because the writing style changes at those points.  Any die-hard sci-fi reader would love the non-romance parts and even the sexual tension.  However,  most of my guy friends and some of the other women, if they had gotten the book out of sci-fi, would have been very upset when they hit those few romance elements!	2005-06-16

Although the first book of the series was a little rough in parts, the characters are developing well and I would recommend the series.  The authors provide clues to their pasts and futures throughout the series.  The element of mystery and the characters  themselves make this series engaging.

However, I would limit my negative feelings about the prose to the character dialogue and as this was a first novel, I can forgive the similarities to other series and books.  After all, we can't even write a theoretical research paper in school without using references.  Hopefully, Mitchell Graham will develop as an &quot;original&quot; writer as he gains more notoriety, self-assurance, and more creative freedom.<br />This book had some of the BEST fighting descriptions that I have read in a very long time.

Interesting narritive hook with a genitic twist on the old thought that many persons once thought to be vampires in the past may actually have been victims of the somewhat rare disease porphyria.<br />The rest of the plot is a massive jumble of threads that Ms. Morrison should not have tried to tie together in 320 pages.  The book would have been much better in a short series of three or four 300 page books that would have allowed for more detail and thoughfulness in dealing with characters, character developments and parellel storylines.

The ending really ruined the  series for me.	2000-08-15

As an avid reader, most serial books seem uneventful and formulaic  after their fourth or fifth installment.  This book was not as predicable  as most and contained a complex enough core to keep me reading for more  than one day.  Normally, books of this size that are this far along in a  series are only good for a quick one night's read like Robert Jordan's Path  of Daggers or Jean Auel's Plains of Passage.	2000-08-15

Although the flyer for it reads well, the story line is very trite.  Every culture seems to have a  tale about a girl/woman at a well that is looked down upon by others; yet,  that same low caste person is elevated by a religious figure later in the  tale.  That is in essence what this tale embodies. I would recommend the  book to younger readers, but not for a well read person.  It could be  useful in a college prep English class where readers must constantly  be  aware of the smallest symbology so that they can write a paper.  This book  is overloaded with things that can be referred to in a book report, but not  of much interest otherwise.	2000-08-15
