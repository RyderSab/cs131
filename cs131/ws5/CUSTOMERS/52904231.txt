The infamous, double  dealing,  &quot;lane changing&quot;, Basil is the part of the Dynamic Duo  of central characters.  The leading lady is Yancy Braxton, from his last  book, and these two have finally met their matches ... dysfunctional,  self-absorbed, self-important and sad.<br />They are madly in love with each  other but have so many 'issues' that a final connection is definitely a  challenge.  <br />If you've followed the series of E.  Lynn Harris books,  you  should not be disappointed.  Both characters play their true selves out in  the end.<br />This was a quick, page turning read.   If you like Mr. Harris,  you will not be disappointed.	2000-08-15
US	52904231	R24GZ6HDLGOL3M	1573227161	950636517	Caucasia: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Race Matters	Cole and Birdie are the daughters of a black father and a white mother in Boston, MA.  Cole, the eldest, takes after the father while Birdie, takes after the mother.<br />The parents, probably like more than a few of the mixed  marriages of that time, consisted of a black intellectual with big ideas  and theories and a rebellious WASP who was risking family ties to be a  radical, militant whose views were diametrically opposed to her  upbringing.<br />Once the marital problems began, and the separation occurred,  the mother's militant 'activities' put her in the predicament of having to  flee.   To expedite this, she took custody of Birdie and the father took  custody of Cole and 'went underground.'   <br />The story is told in the voice  of Birdie, the white one, and shed light on the pain of looking one way  while one's heritage pointed to another.   She had to 'pass' for Jewish  while on the run with her mother and was privy to the subtle and overt  racial prejudice harbored by those in the all white world she had to live  in. In effect, she was 'undercover' and learned the secrets of those who  would most certainly reject her if they knew her genetic makeup.<br />The  story speaks of a black father who flip-flops his racial views from the  extreme of marrying a white woman to making racial remarks that are hurtful  to his children.  The mother almost seems crazy as she wallows in  self-pity, feminism, and an overzealous interest in 'the struggle.'<br />I  think this is a great first novel.  A great novel period.  It is not for  those seeking a quick or casual read as there is a lot to think about.	2000-07-02

Her motto of doing it her 'own self' reminded me of my independence as a child.<br />Yet,  when I saw the movie,  I didn't  see an empowered child.  I saw a sad story of an abused and abandoned  child.  I laughed through the book because you couldn't tell Ellen that she  wasn't in control. The girl had a plan. Yet the movie left me so choked up  that I almost felt bad that I hadn't realized how alone this child was  before.<br />I am glad I read the book first.  I think the author intended to  show this from Ellen's perspective and not the department of children and  family services. <br />Oft times,  people write off childrens' spirit's and  strength and turn them into mindless/feelingless being who need their lives  to be decided upon by not so informed adults.<br />Yes, Ellen Foster was a  tragic story. But it was also a story of great courage a thinking mind.   <br />It was this book that made me a Kaye Gibbons fan !	2000-06-15

The subsequent loneliness and  abandonment leaves a hole in children.<br />At the same time, Kaye Gibbons  portrayal of this woman made me laugh out loud.  From her justifying  hitting a woman with her car because she dared to wear a certain outfit,   to her tirade over hearing the spoons click in the bowl,  I began to wonder  if I weren't a little imbalanced for finding it funny instead of sick.  The  reactions didn't seem so far fetched to me.  That or perhaps I know a whole  lot of undiganosed folks out there who I thought were 'normal'.	2000-06-15

Was Gloria just trying to get a book out to compete with the barrage of fiction being released by black writers or what?  She could not have been seriously thinking that this book was of any value.<br />The characters were  week.  The storylines were not in line with the way they were portrayed in  the Women of Brewster Place. <br />I got this book when it first came out.  I  read it quickly and nearly tossed it down in disgust.  I went to the post  office and mailed it to my best friend because I wanted to see if I was  crazy for thinking it was so bad (but I didn't want her to waste the money  herself).<br />I was truly disappointed.

Compared to characters in his firsttwo books (Invisible Life and Just as I Am) these people seemed to lack the same emotion and inner struggle. I am guessing that the first novels were somewhat autobiographical and that enabled the writer to put more of himself into the stories. Though And This To Shall Pass was a captivating story, it seemed like more of a formula novel than one of real intent.  <br />Perhaps I viewed his first two as informative. Single black women often joke that all the eligible black men are either married, in jail or gay.  Mr. Harris schooled us that some of the so-called remaining good ones are secretly bisexual and leading lives which can ultimately wreak havoc for all involved. Most single women that I know who have read E. Lynn, recommend him. Those who haven't say they are too afraid.	2000-06-14

I read Tananarive Due's My Soul To Keep first and finished The Between months later ... They were equally superb. <br />The  Between is a suspenseful first novel which chronicles the confusing life  (death?) of Hilton, a man who, at age 8, nearly drowned but was saved by  his grandmother. As an adult he suffers from horrendous nightmares and soon  becomes unable to distinguish them from his waking hours. Coupled with  having to protect his family from a psychotic, racist, ex-convict who is  after his prosecutor wife, Hilton and the reader are tossed into a world of  dreams/reality, life/death, sanity/insanity ... death/life. <br />This was a  chilling and thrilling tale. I am usually not one who automatically sees  movie potential in a book but I think this one would be a tortuous theme  for the silver screen. <br />I anxiously (and nervously) await another novel  by Tananarive Due !	2000-06-14

It is a funny, sad, sometimes  suspenseful story  about friendship between two girls.

This is E. Lynn Harris' fourth novel so you know that at least one of the main  characters is a gay man with a good heart. The infamous Basil Henderson  appears in this story as well and adds twists to the lives of many. This  time, though, E. Lynn sheds a little more light on Basil's background and  you can, at least try, to understand why he behaves the way he does.  <br />I  liked this book because it is real about the friendships it portrays.  Nearly 20 years after college, these characters are still fighting, loving  and learning from each other. The familiarity of the families, college life  and professional pursuits make this book very easy to read and relate to.  For those who love his stories, this is a good one.  <br />If This World Were  Mine is crying for a sequel to tie up lots of loose threads.	2000-06-14

In Search of Satisfaction was, by far,  her most 'out there' book.   I just couldn't believe the outright scandalous nature of some of the characters. <br />Though I think one  of the underlying themes regarding Satan was overdone a bit,  the real  point,  that people do a WHOLE lot in their quest for happiness and  satisfaction,  ultimately came through in the end.<br />Most of her short  stories are short,  sweet and generally have happy endings. This book takes  you on a wild ride with some selfish, crazy, plotting people along with a  couple pure and simple folks.	2000-06-14

Still, it is reminiscent of Michelle Wallace's &quot;Black Macho and  The Myth of The Superwoman&quot; which debuted some 20 odd years or so ago.   Being a strong willed, independent Black woman is still as hard today as  it was 20 years ago and I am glad that there are still fierce sistah's out  there willing to address the issues at hand.<br />Great view on a never  vanishing topic from a new voice and new perspective !	2000-06-12

Diane McKinney Whetstone is one of my favorite writers of the 90's.   I LOVED Tumbling,  was again impressed by Tempest Rising and was anxiously patting my foot waiting for another novel  to be published.   Blues Dancing was yet another 'love story' which  featured 'tragic' female characters who ultimately find themselves and  overcome their demons. <br />This story was simple, yet lyrical - complicated,  yet easy to read and understand. You could compare her to Toni Morrison but  you can leave the notepad, dictionary and hightlighter in your desk.<br />It  is hard to trudge through this wave 'Dating Game', junk food fiction by  African American  writers which has marked the 1990's.  But,  finding Diane  McKinney,  Edwidge Danticat and Helen Elaine Lee has renewed my faith in  real writers and makes me glad I am a reader.<br />The main character, Verdi,  along with her male suitors Johnson and Rowe,  demonstrates how easily  people can give up their power to another person or substance and how  finding your own self and own way are really the only ways to assure that  someone elses strengths or weaknesses are not making you what you are.	1999-12-28

With the recent proliferation of trash in the genre of popular African American fiction,  it was heartwarming to read a piece like this.  Popular fiction has its place but my true thirst is for literature by talented black writers.<br />I am not sure if I was more mesmerized by the story or the skillful prose.  It takes a REAL writer to create imagery. It takes skill, study and a very special gift.  Though the subject matter was not what I expected,  the mother/daughter/aunt/grandmother bond truly represented a family tree.   If one had any empathy at all,  they were able to see and feel each point of view.  Sophie's painful acceptance of her mother as a person who did the very best she could with the cards she was dealt should be a lesson to all adult children to stop blaming and for parents to stop feeling guilty.<br />I had to put down Krik-Krak because I found it too sad at the time.

If you think Shaneska Jackson and Roslyn Mc Millan 'tell it like it is', run ... don't walk, to your favorite bookseller. This is definitely of that genre. <br /> From my standpoint, I should have taken a hint from the comments on the back of the jacket. One gent wrote that he carried it every where and couldn't put it down in the three weeks it took him to read it (I read it during a 4 hour plane ride ... in between snoozes).  I will give you a couple more hints. The author spends an entire chapter talking about the woes of bikini and pubic hair. She spends almost another 1/2 chapter talking about some woman eating boogers (her own, of course) !  This type of writing is not my cup of tea though I am certain many find it hilarious and entertaining. This is definately 'pop fiction' ... not heady,  not deep, not literature.  <br /> All that aside, this is a story of a very strong friendship. Scenes from a Sistah is about two very different 'sistahs', their love for one another and how friendship endures some very bizarre scenarios.  Ms. Files put forth a lot of effort and is now a published novelist.  That deserves a tremendous amount of credit and best wishes for future success. <BR>	1997-11-17

I don't want to use the term scathing to describe this book as that word seems to  have a negative connotation.   This book is, in my eyes, far from negative.   But,  the unfiltered,    blunt and to the point observations that Ms. Nelson makes about the status of Black women in  America may leave many folks singed !! <br /> Sharing revealing examples from her own life,  the author cuts through many of the euphemisms  used to mask racism, sexism and the outright abuse of Black women over the decades.   She  unapologetically discusses her pain, anger frustration while leaving us the message  that it is OKAY for us feel and express it as well.  We do not have to continue to be good little  colored girls in the face of people telling us,  through words and actions,  that we do not  count.   The 'niggerbitchfit' we feel boiling over and out of us, on far too many occasions, has its merits for our mental and physical well being ! <br /> She also makes some stinging comments about some of Black America's cherished 'role models'  and 'icons'.   Who would dare to call Maya Angelou a 'mammy' figure?   Who would call the  women of 'Living Single' updated examples of the same old black female stereotypes?   Ms. Nelson.
