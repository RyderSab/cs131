Much has been made in recent years of how politicians turn to ancient authorities for guidance and justification in making difficult decisions.  Members of the Bush administration, for example, invoked Thucydides and Herodotus during the build up to our attack on Iraq.  And, yet, as Goldhill so smartly explains, we need not view the ancients as distant mentors:  they live and breathe within us, for better or worse--influencing everything from how we view sex and gender to what entertains us to how our government works. From sex symbols to sporting events, we are impacted by the cultures of our deep past. Amassing a dazzling array of examples, Goldhill is a wonderful synthesizer and storyteller.  Highly entertaining, this book is recommended for any general reader, including young adults, interested in ancient history.	2004-11-20

A charming yet wise critique of the culture of holidays in America, the volume is lavishly illustrated in color and serves up platter upon platter of wonderfully written commentary about holiday custom, lore, and consumption.  Maud Lavin draws upon the many quirky and fascinating details of material culture that constitute Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter.  From traditional mashed potatoes to scary costumes, Santa to the Easter Bunny, Lavin and her collaborators show us how we consumers depend on the holidays and how the holidays depend on us. A very entertaining and handsome book.  Highly recommended.	2004-11-12

Feeney offers a beautifully nuanced portrait of our most complicated president, a devotee of movies, and his time.  Feeney explores Nixon's life, personality, and political career through the lens of his involvement with the media, in particular his preoccupation with Hollywood movies.  The President sought inspiration in them and even found in movie characters role models for himself--he drew inspiration, for example, from George C. Scott's impersonation of General Patton during the darkest days of the Vietnam War.  Hollywood, too, was enamoured of Nixon, and Feeney explores how he has been portrayed by a wide range of directors, and how his presence seems to saturate so many films of the 1970s--including \\"Shampoo\\" and Francis Ford Coppola's \\"The Conversation.\\"  Feeney pulls it all off with sparkling wit and a genuine sympathy for his subject.  A fascinating book about a fascinating president.  Highly recommended.	2004-11-10

It was the birthplace of Raphael, and the town features many works by that artist as well as by Piero della Francesca and other artistic luminaries.  It remains a real jewel of a town.  This book is highly recommended to anyone planning to tour the Italian hill towns of Umbria and Tuscany, to follow the Piero della Francesca trail, or enjoy a hiking trip through the Umbrian countryside. It also offers a great armchair journey to anyone interested in Italy.	2004-11-09

And why are so many of them published?  Is it because this varied and sometimes arduous journey continues, after more than 1000 years, to inspire and fascinate those who take up its challenge?  A simple subject search at this site will deliver dozens of related titles.  <br />Having read many of them, I can attest that this new one, by the art historian Conrad Rudolph, is overall the best.  It is short, cheap, and in about 120 pages, packs in everything: a history of pilgrimage as well as a personal account of the author's own trek over 1000 miles, that promises to engage the mind and senses of even the most skeptical reader or seasoned traveler.  Some quixotic photographs and great advice for anyone who wants to embark on this trek round out the volume. The writing is wonderful. It is, in a word, a gem.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in the middle ages, in northern Spain and southern France, or in making the pilgrimage, whether on the actual road or in the imagination, coming to the experience from the cozy comfort of an armchair.	2004-05-01

So it is in part about his art, but more importantly, it offers an intimate look at Amsterdam in the seventeenth century, and conveys how the Jewish communities there lived and worked and interacted with the larger Christian population. <br />The book design is lovely, the text charming, and the illustrations quite remarkable.

Houdon's brilliance as a portraitist and psychologist shines through in his amazingly lifelike busts of Benjamin Franklin, Robert Fulton, Thomas Jefferson, Catherine the Great, Voltaire and many more.  In fact, the book offers a veritable Who's Who-or Who was Anybody--in the second half of the eighteenth century.   Rogues and nobility alike brought miraculously to life in stone.  This volume is a must for anyone interested in French, European or American art and culture of the revolutionary period.  Lavishly illustrated, it promises to be the definitive work on Houdon for many years to come.	2003-09-11

Cezanne has generally been portrayed as a member of the Paris circles of modern art, but in truth he spent most of his life and time living and working in the beautiful countryside of Provence, where he was born.  Kallmyer describes how the painter took the province, with its landscapes, agriculture, and people as a key subject, partly out of political motive.  Centrists were working to establish Paris as the political center of power and government in France, much to the dismay and horror of rural French citizens.  Cezanne worked hard to help Provence develop the identity it retains today as a lush, magical, light-filled place and the destination of millions of visitors each year.	2003-08-07

Each writer explores a &quot;charged&quot; term currently used in art criticism, such as &quot;representation,&quot; &quot;social art history,&quot; &quot;ugliness,&quot; and &quot;beauty.&quot;  In each essay, the writer explores the meaning of the term by applying it to a single work of art.  Though the essays vary in difficulty, each is ultimately very rewarding.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of art criticism.

It's a book about what's true about so-called \\"true crime.\\" Pinkus writes well, and uses the format of a film treatment (not a screenplay) to tell the story of a Rome fascinated with film, celebrities, and stardom--whose Post-war denizens think of their own lives in terms of the movies they go to see.  There are some great photographs in this book, and it is in part about the birth of the paparazzi, which occurred in relation to this murder case. Features a great cast of characters.  Apparently dozens of filmmakers have, over the years, tried to figure out how to make a movie about this mystery.  Maybe now Pinkus has provided just the right \\"map\\" for telling this great, complex story via celluloid.	2003-06-03

This book nudges up to all kinds of scary issues: pornography, images of violence, censorship, freedom of expression.  The brilliant lawyer Anthony Julius takes as his occasion the ways in which modern art since the mid nineteenth century has taken as part of its mission to challenge (and raise into public consciousness) the moral and cultural norms of a society.  When is a work of art pornographic?  When does it portray and comment upon a work of such savage violence that we are violated by being challenged to even look at it?  What role does satire play in massaging transgressive images and their ideas for general consumption?  From Manet's \\"Olympia\\" to Serrano's \\"Piss Christ,\\" Julius assembles the evidence in this broadly and wonderfully written account of a modern phenomenon.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-10

The images, gracefully drawn and beautifully colored, depicted a bizarre range of flora and fauna: deformed lemons with claw-like legs, flamingoes, dramatic portraits of badger faces, strange plants...<br />The discovery marked the beginning of a great adventure told in the book--of Freedberg's search for and discovery of the source of the drawings: a 17th-century gang of noblemen and eccentrics based largely in Rome who took as their mission nothing less than the discovery, analysis, and visual record of all natural knowledge.  They called themselves the Accademia Lincea, or Academy of Lynxes.  This was the age of Galileo, who was in fact a member, and whose work the Lincea edited and published.  With the aid of microscopes, telescopes, and other instruments, the Lincea and their peers began to develop a picture of the natural world in all its details that profoundly challenged traditional views of Heaven and Earth, supported by the Roman Catholic Church.  <br />Freedberg's manner is at once learned and accessible.  He tells a gripping story of a group of fascinating characters, some brilliant, some insane, and their grand projects, including a decidedly obsessive interest in bees.  Lavishly illustrated in color and black-and-white, this is surely one of the most attractive, novel, and important works of history this year.	2002-12-19

It looks at the war through the eyes of the artists who recorded it, and of some who even fought in it.  Privileged artists like Degas, Manet,  and Regnault suited up and mounted the ramparts, even as they recorded the struggle of day to day life with their charcoal and paint brushes.  We encounter other artists--Courbet, Puvis de Chavannes, and Rosa Bonheur--who each served France in his or her own way.  <br />Clayson is an excellent writer and storyteller.  In her book, we encounter the endless bread lines, the staving masses who grew so hungry that even the elephant in the zoo was slaughtered and devoured; what role innovations in public lighting played, mail being sent by carrier pigeons that soared above the Prussian troops surrounding the city.  Clayson is always sensitive to the role that gender plays in French culture, and we learn how gender roles were challenged during this stressful time. Vividly anecdotal and highly learned, this is the first book to explore the subject of life and art in Paris during one of the most critical moments in French history.  A must for anyone interested in Paris or French art and history. And a pleasure to read.	2002-09-30

It's history, and it explains better than anything I've read how people actually looked at things and perceived them in the sixteenth through early nineteenth centuries.  In particular, Dubbini focuses on how the landscape was perceived and how it seemed to change as it became increasingly interrupted by towns and cities.  He explains how &quot;the glance&quot; evolved in relation to the relative anonymity and isolation of city life.  And he discusses how these changes in &quot;looking&quot; inevitably affected what was chosen to be painted and how it was accomplished. He also looks at how advances in mapmaking and new scientific technologies (including photography) have impacted the way we see. This is an invaluable book, and, considering that it is quite erudite, a pleasure to read.  Unusual illustrations, too.	2002-05-13

The ways in which that event--the largest strike in French history--transformed French and European culture are explored by Ross, a formidable presence in the area of French cultural studies.  Smart, succint writing--richly anecdotal yet theoretically sophisticated--this book should soon prove a classic in modern French studies and in Sixties culture.	2002-05-03

Hans Belting, trained as a medievalist, has in more recent years, along with Arthur Danto, set his compass on the evaluation of the status of certain art historical values:  he has contemplated whether or not modern art is ended and in what ways, examined whether the discipline of art history itself is outmoded, and, in this fascinating study, looked at how our notion of the &quot;masterpiece&quot; constitutes an impossible goal in the modern era (since the mid 1700s)...how designated &quot;masterpieces&quot; such as the Mona Lisa and the Sistine Chapel are impossible and even absurd to attempt in a world of modern social and aesthetic values.  Highly anecdotal and idiosyncratic, this is an important book for anyone interested in the history of the history of art.	2002-04-18

I've purchased histories of Surrealism before--all of which are now desperately out-dated and out of print besides...including the great Abrams book on Dada and Surrealism.  This book beats them all.  For one, it covers not just the Surrealists in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s, but examines the spread of the movement to the US, Africa, Japan, India, and South America during the 1940s-1960s.  For two, it deals with all media:  painting, sculpture, poetry, philosophy, fiction, film, etc.  For three, it features biographies of all the major stars, and also of all the minor players in their orbits.  For four, it includes 1000 illustrations--many of them documentary and never published before this book was originally released in the French edition, as well as many many color plates scattered throughout the text.  A beautiful production, and a terrific text by Durozoi, who was linked to the Surrealists in the 1950s and 1960s by virtue of his involvement with philosophy.	2002-04-01

Sally Chappell, who writes for the Travel Section of the New York Times, tells a fascinationg story of a sophisticated ancient culture and empire  that thrived along the Mississippi valley between 1100 and 1500, at the same time that the Aztecs were coming into power in Meso-America and the Incas in South America.  Cahokia was the major city of this empire, and in 1200 its population exceeded that of London in Europe.  Chappell tells the story of this historic site near St. Louis, with its fabulous monumental architecture, relgious traditions, and trading networks.  But Chappell takes it well beyond the story of the Native Americans.  She explores how the site evolved over time, was influenced by French explorers, was used during the Civil War, and what became of the site in the 20th century.

Scholars have been obsessed with his paintings for years.  To my delight, this book by Bryan Jay Wolf actually offers fresh insight into the issues that preoccupied the artist--and well as other Dutch painters in the seventeenth century.  Issues of commerce, domesticity, private space, gender--and new innovations in technique, some of the most important in the entire history of painting.<br />The book is wonderfully illustrated, not just with images by Vermeer, but also by de Hooch, Metsu, Luiken, Netscher, Ter Borch, Rubens, Dou, van Hoogstraten, and Steen--and closer to our own time, paintings by Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, even Charles Addams--as Wolf explains the lasting impact of this strange and elusive artist.

STarting in 1969 and continuing up to the eve of Watergate, American modern artist Philip Guston developed a series of ruthless cartoons lampooning Richard Nixon's rise to power.  Metanymic in strategy, Nixon's physiognomy is rendered as a very [...phallic] schnoz and [...similarly-themed]jowls; Kissinger is simply a pair of horn-rimmed glasses skipping along beside; etc.  We see Nixon ascend from a homely quaker childhood, survive the Checkers scandal, and eventually triumph in his second bid for the presidency.  We accompany him to Key Biscayne and to China...all via Guston's comic vision.  This book is a must for anyone interested in the 1960s, in political cartoons, in Nixon, or in Philip Guston's career.	2001-12-12

Beautifully translated by Richard Howard and featuring a gorgeous design, this is one of the best and most accessible books I've ever read about Proust.  One can tell that Brassai had a great love for Proust's work--and he richly explores the writer's life in France in the early 20th century and his fascination with the new art of photography...and how the medium impacted Proust's work.  Really, this is a special book and should appeal to anyone interested in photography, Proust, French culture in the first half of the twentieth century.	2001-10-18

Though it certainly addresses itself to the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois's mysterious and beautiful &quot;Spider&quot; series of sculptures, it is just as much about the &quot;experiencing&quot; of artworks in real space and time.  But Mieke Bal goes beyond the phenomenological and explores the way in which viewers bring their own sense of history, memory and culture to bear upon the object being viewed/experienced.  For Bal, in this particular instance, it is Bernini that haunts the sculptures under scrutiny.  And her case in convincing.  The book is short, and exquisitely produced in full color.	2001-09-04

The result is a fascinating portrait of life under Louis XIV, a life driven by hierarchy, rank, and blood.  Great book about obsessive, ruthless social climbing at its worst and best.	2001-07-31

That book dealt in part with gardens and other spaces of the 17th century, and this volume happily picks up where that one left off.  Harbison explores here both the whimsy and playfulness of the Baroque sensibility and its more sober grounding in the Counter-Reformation.  He looks at how the Baroque spread beyond Europe to the Americas, to Asia, and to Africa over the course of several centuries, and he examines diverse subjects ranging from bizarre gardens that go nowhere to the novel designs of architects Borromini, Bernini, and Wren.

The author tells the long controversial story of the many debates surrounding the worship of images of gods and other notables in Western culture.  Starting with the proscription against the Golden Calf and the Hebraic and Islamic laws against the 'graven image,&quot; Besancon tracks the history of this debate through Greek and Roman culture, the various phases of early and medieval Christianity, including the ways in with the Eastern and Roman Catholic churches have dealt differently with the problem.  Besancon then tracks the status of the religious image through the Renaissance, and how it was perceived by Enlightenment philosophers.  He ends with a discussion of how art came to be perceived in religious terms and how the artist came to be perceived as a kind of romantic god starting in the late nineteenth century.  He ends with a discussion of the tense relationship between modernism and spirituality, dealing with the art of Kandinsky, Mondrian, and others.  <br />The book is a little strange:  one is always aware that Besancon has his own view of things--but it is a highly learned, far-ranging and charming view.

She wrote sizzling, steamy fiction that she claimed chronicled her own, true adventures as a young femme fatale growing up in Indochina, as a student in Paris, as a radical politician and literary maven.  She could be generous and loyal to a fault, or, in the blink of an eye, turn into a raging, arrogant harpy.  <br />If the truth is stranger than fiction, then Duras was even more monstrous than the characters in her novels.  This is the story, wonderfully told, of a truly sick ticket indeed.	2000-12-07

The stories are sometimes seductive, sometimes funny, always smart.  A wide-ranging anthology of work by Italian women writers--including a story by literary star Rossana Campo.  Cutrufelli's essay introduces this as a breakthrough volume--the first anthology of erotica penned by modern Italian women.  La bella figura.	2000-10-18

But the book is a  gem--well written, elegant...and goes far in explaining the theological and  cultural issues behind Hawksmoor's odd choices in designing these  buildings.  The book also served as a very useful guide as I traveled  around London in search of Hawksmoor projects.	2000-09-12

It is Leo Steinberg at his best--witty, learned, insightful--giving us a brief survey of Robert Rauschenburg's art from the early 1950s until the present day.  The book is beautifully  designed and printed, and makes a great gift for anyone interested in the  New York art scene.  A lot of book for the buck.	2000-05-22

Brassai was a witty, wry observer of Paris life and an excellent writer as well as  photographer.  The episodes he captures of Picasso's life are  irreplaceable, often hysterical--and not recounted in other, stuffier books  on the great modern artist.  Highly recommended for art lovers.  A pleasure  to read	1999-11-25

This is a book about Africa, tobacco, orality, movies, sex,  culture, desire and loss.  The globe-trotting narrator takes us through the  streets of Manhattan, o'er the freeways of LA, into hotel rooms in Tokyo,  dinner parties in Scotland, as well as the tobacco farms and factories in  Zimbabwe. Great fun--a winner.	1999-11-19

I loved Neville's first two books, but I must say, THE MAGIC CIRCLE dances rings around them. A book that covers 2000 years of history, a dazzling family embroiled in all the intrigues of our century, and a heroine, Ariel  Behn, who can even out-ski an avalanche like James Bond. If you love  action, adventure, historical or modern, this book is for you.	1999-09-01

Her thesis is that we can learn as much about a culture by examining it through the lens of its cuisine as by studying its art, literature, etc.  This book is at once highly learned and well written--erudite and witty,  like Fisher.  An important work for anyone interested in the history of  food and eating, the book covers &quot;the prehistory of cuisine,&quot; the  food culture of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, and Europe in the Middle  Ages.  Good illustrations.  Can't wait to read the second volume covering  the Renaissance through modernism that Bober is now writing.	1999-08-24

The Brandenburg Gate?  Hitler's Bunker, etc.   Should they be torn down, the stories they embody erased?  Or should they  stand as a legacy of German culture, however tainted it may be.  A  remarkable book about a remarkable city.  Do read it.	1999-06-23

The story of Matisse's siege on the US artworld is fascinating, full of great vignettes about MOMA, the Cohn sisters, Alfred Barr, Barnes, the American press.  Equally impressive is  the smart, whimsical design and the gorgeous color plates.	1999-06-08

All the others represent extremes of repulsion or devotion--perhaps a good sign for a book.  After all, it draws a reaction.  To measure Cunningham's prose against Woolf is perhaps  unfair--but, he sets up the comparison himself.  He's a good writer,  perhaps a bit precious and too self-conscious about writing a good  line--and all in all he did a pretty great job of pulling together three  separate narratives about characters that range from boring to merely dull  to fascinating (Woolf).  The story line about the California wife I found  excruciating until she decides to check into a hotel. At that point I  thought &quot;great.  She's going to kill herself and we can get on with  the good stuff.&quot; <br />A lurid question:  Did Woolf really only use one  stone to drown herself?  I thought there were several....	1999-04-21

He's telling several at once, following in the literary tradition of Borges, Nabokov, Barth, and Cortazar.  Not an easy task, but by and large, he pulls it off with wit and  care.  And the reader should bring wit and care to the reading of this  book:  not easy, but infinitely rewarding.  And a real tease in terms of  the ways in which various formal aspects of a book (text, footnotes,  illustrations) constitute discrete narrative voices.  In this book, the  voices weave, fight, talk back to one another, swallow one another, and  ultimately tell an intriguing, ironic tale of murder and--guess what--love.	1999-04-08

Veronica Franco was one of the foremost poets of her time--her time being the 1600s--and her place being Venice.  It is amazing that it has taken this long for a volume of her poetry and prose to make it into English.   Witty, erotic, playful, sophisticated:  such is her poetry, by and large.   The woman had a wicked tongue and a busy pen.  This volume is a must for  anyone interested in the history of literary women.	1999-04-08

Given the current climate--in which a dim-faced bimbo can bring down a  president--this book is refreshing in that it tells how Franco used sex to  further the political and economic causes of her beloved home, Venice.    Though the author wrote this as an academic biography, the character,  personality, and wit of Franco comes through.  The whole story is set in  the lushly atmospheric and decadent days when Venice was on the verge of  losing its dominance as an empire.  Highly recommended, as is the volume of  Franco's poetry just released by the University of Chicago Press.	1999-04-08

This novel is so far above the typical art-heist books being cranked out these days.  The superb, comic writing reminds one of the best work of Ngaio Marsh.  The characters in their manifold perversities, problems, and  schemes are deeply satisfying.  Van Adler's critical insights to the art  history profession are right on target.  So who is this Van Adler anyway?   It's hard to believe this is really a debut novel.  It seems more likely  that it comes from an experienced literary comic novelist who has, for the  fun of it, turned his or hand to the genre of mystery.	1999-02-20

Brassai proves himself a wonderful writer as well as photographer.  His love of Paris in the 1920s  and 1930s is everywhere evident--the glamour, the grime, the artistic  urgency of the place, the crazy characters who called it home.  Letters to  My Parents is a must-read to anyone interested in this idiosyncratic artist  and establishment of photography as an art form in the early twentieth  century.	1999-02-09

In this engaging book, cultural critic and historian WJT Mitchell will convince even the most skeptical reader that dinosaurs are amongst us, around us, in us--a thriving cultural icon of our time.   Mitchell has written this book to include the reader beyond the academy.   Consequently, it is &quot;popular&quot; writing at its finest:  learned,  witty, sophisticated.  Ignore those sour reviews in the NYT, and read.	1999-02-09

A wonderful account of the history of intellectual property,  copyright, authors' claims, and the rise of print culture in Europe  (particularly England) during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.

Employing such disparate evidence as Gary Larson cartoons,  shops that trade in so-called ethnic goods, fortune tellers, and popular  notions of gender, di Leonardo also critiques the role that American  anthropologists from Margaret Mead to Clifford Geertz and the popular press  have played in promoting the cultural myth of &quot;difference&quot; which  ultimately serves to separate us all, one from the other.  di Leonardo's  meditation on Margaret Mead alone is worth the cost of admission, but be  assured the book is about so much more as it takes the entire discipline of  anthropology to task.  It's about time we had a smart, complex book like  this that serves as a cultural reckoning.  Makes Torgovnick's &quot;Gone  Primitive&quot; look like a first-grade primer.	1998-11-27
