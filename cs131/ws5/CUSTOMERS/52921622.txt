One reads Robert Parker's novels not for their convoluted plot but for the tantalizing dialog that appears in each of his works.  Melancholy Baby does not disappoint.  All the same characters present themselves in the Sunny Randall series that appear in the beloved Spenser series - only the names change and now some remain the same,i.e., Susan Silverman.  Kudos to Mr. Parker because he consistently entertains his audience which is paramount to his continued success.	2005-03-10
US	52921622	RD2ZDEMVMY78C	0399151885	102390096	Double Play	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Pleasantly Surprised!	I didn't realize this was not the typical Spenser P.I. fare and was initially disappointed.  My first thought was to pitch the book and count my losses, however, I had nothing new to read.  The mingling of fiction and truth of this tale of Jackie Robinson's foray into the white world of baseball and the ground breaking necessary for others to enter this field proved both enlightening and thought provoking.  Parker's wonderful characterization of both Robinson and his bodyguard, Burke, as well as the witty dialog, at which Parker excels, are well worth the price of admission.  Kudos to you Mr. Parker for not resting on your laurels as so many other authors have done and continuing to provide your readers with the very best offerings.	2004-06-11

I was expecting another Alex Delaware and didn't realize this was a &quot;stand alone&quot; type of novel.  Maybe I didn't give this one a chance, but I don't think Conspiracy Club comes even close in character development to the Delaware series.

This is my first book by these authors and I must say the storyline captivated me.  Without giving anything away, I could not put this one down. The character of FBI Agent Pendergrast coupled with his novice assistant, Corrie Swanson, was quite a polarized but interesting mix.  I hope to see more of Ms. Swanson in upcoming books.

One reads the Spenser series not for the convoluted plot but for the characters we've grown to love.

I guess I don't care how old Spenser and Hawk are nor do I feel the need to be judgemental about their unique code of honor or set of rules that govern their behavior.

The best part is the interfacing among Alex, Mike and Mercer, however, this failed to raise this novel to a level where I would recommend.

Yes, it's predictible, but are the Plum series worthy of any literary prize?  No, we read them not for the plot development but for the characters we've grown to love.

Although it certainly is the author's prerogative to change characters and genre on us, it is very disappointing to get a read like this from Mr. Connelly.  The character of Henry Pierce is totally unbelivable and entirely unsympathetic.  How could someone so brilliant be so dumb each step of the way other than the last 20 pages.  One can't expect one's imagination to run that rampant. I'll certainly give Mr. Connelly another chance - but his margin of error is greatly reduced.	2002-12-17

Can't believe all these &quot;friends and acquaintances&quot; of the deceased would agree to meet and entertain in their homes a complete stranger who is interested in who murdered rich, little, perfect Courtney Logan.

I have to agree with the consensus in that this is not the best Spenser novel.  In fact, it is not even in the upper 50%.  I guess they all can't be winners, however, it is disappointing when one has so enjoyed the witty repartee that has usually existed among the central characters of Spenser, Susan, Hawk, Quirk and Belson, et al.

Daniel Ames, &quot;the Associate,&quot; keeps making the same mistakes throughout the book. His character becomes maddingly annoying simply for his stupidity. Since he supposedly was bright enough to put himself through law school and be hired by one of the top-notch firms in Portland, this premise alone lacks credibility. Actually, Daniel Ames is not especially likable nor the majority of the company he keeps. While the plot has some possibilities, there are no real surprises.

First of all, I found the major premise of a railroad being sabotaged by a man whose wife and child were killed by a train to be trite.

I thought the plot was intricately woven and, just when you thought you had it figured out, the last two pages provide a final surprise.

After all, if Mr. Parker wants to digress from the Spenser series (not that he does by much), he should be allowed to do that.  After all, the characters are really quite similar right down to Rosie, the miniature bull terrier, to Pearl, the wonder dog Lab- just with different names.  The dialog is wonderfully Parker - humorous, intelligent, flamboyant, interesting.  However, what I cannot forgive is the lack of an ending.  I truly thought that the pages had somehow been ripped from my book.  Alas, not to be.

I think this is an excellent first offering for Mr. Connolly, however, count the people who have been murdered simply through association with Charlie Parker as well as the fact that &quot;Bird&quot; just happens to be  present at most of these murders or discovery of the bodies. I realize this  is fictional but totally lacking in credibility.  Also, enter the premise  that Charlie is no longer on the NYPD nor a registered P.I. and the FBI,  Police and Coroners not only allow him to be present, but oftentime demand  his presence at the crime scenes as well as permit him to witness the  autopsies.  Get real, at least for a little bit.  Perhaps, a bit more of a  reality based foundation would allow me to believe some or part of Mr.  Connolly's premise.  As others have mentioned, there could have been at  least two and perhaps three individual books here.  You actually believe  the Modine murders end book #1.  It doesn't tie well and so so many  characters in a convoluted plot are oftentimes hard to track.  I do believe  this author has a tremendous amount of potential, however, I think he  attempted to do too much at once as if he believed he would not get another  opportunity to author and be published.	1999-06-25

As Goldy ages, her mental capacity seems  to be diminishing.  I figured this one out early on and there was nowhere  to go because the characters were so unremarkable and totally unlikable.   Better luck next time, Diane. I'm extremely disappointed in your effort!	1998-11-18

Does she  actually get paid for these plots and vapid characters?  PLEASE, how about  some life-like individuals with feeling.  This tale could have been  conceived with more aplomb by a ten year old.  No wonder Todd committed  suicide; his mother was a Stepford wife! It's my own fault.  I promised  myself years ago to NEVER BUY ANOTHER DANIELLE STEEL.  I thought that Ms.  Steele may have matured as many authors do, however, she has regressed.  Her first novels contained more thoughtful planning and character  development. &quot;Show her the money&quot; and we did; we purchased her  book.  Shame on us!!!	1998-10-08

I enjoyed reading this book, unlike many others who have commented.  Ms.  Brown's books are usually good &quot;beach reads&quot; but one can forecast  how the tale will end after the first chapter if not sooner.  I think  Unspeakable shows growth in her style and in the fact that life is not so  predictible nor are people always so beautiful, perfect,kind, friendly nor  goals as easily attainable as a book's heroes seem to find.	1998-09-01

If  you're truly a Kinsey Milhone fan, you would think N is for Noose was written by someone other than Sue Grafton.  The story never left the ground and the &quot;pals&quot; we've all become so familiar with in the series were nearly nonexistent.  The plot was trite, lacked imagination and never was a mystery from the inception.  One hates to feel so cheated after enjoying our heroine and the series from A to N.  Better luck next time, Sue.  A better editor would never have let this one off the press.	1998-06-01

Parker's witty dialog among Spenser, Hawk, Susan, et al, is why I enjoy the Spenser series so much. If you're looking for tons of action, violence and convoluted story line, look elsewhere.  Parker shines in continuing to develop, nurture and mature the characters we've come to love and befriend over the years.  Also, anyone who has a dog knows that &quot;Pearl&quot; really is a person.	1998-04-10

This book never could have been published without the Higgins Clark surname.  I have not encountered such drivel since I read as a child.  In fact, an acquaintance who read the same book thought that perhaps it had been written for &quot;young adults,&quot; however, I know of no teenager who would tolerate such inane dialog.  I know I will never buy another.  Grow up, Carol, and if there is a next time,try to write as an adult.  Even the title is ludicrous!!	1998-04-03

My expectations ran high after reading endless reviews of praise for Mr. Frazier's first novel, however, after plodding through the first 100 pages, it occurred to me that it is difficult to like a book when you simply don't like any of the characters.  Ada is weak albeit much more interesting than Inman, but where is the late night, can't put down page turner I was anticipating?  I cannot understand all the critical acclaim for this vapid piece of work, but I guess that's why there's chocolate and vanilla. I would not recommend this as a great read, a good read or even an okay read but a &quot;read at your own risk&quot; type of read.  Buyer beware!	1998-01-14

Thank goodness I'm not the only one becoming disillusioned with Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta character.  As oftentimes happens, her first novels were much better than the last several published.  Are they just being turned out for their dollar return.  Unnatural Exposure reached midpoint in the book before it gained any interest for me.  The story line is so unbelievable it makes one wonder that we should reclassify Cornwell's tales as Sci-Fi.  The ending was just as anticlimatic as the entire book.  Bring back the interesting, thought-provoking tales of years gone by.  The only interesting character remaining is Det. Marino	1997-09-11

The main problem I had with Anna Batory is that I did not especially like her.  The concept of Sandford's heroine being in charge of a &quot;night crew&quot; which is a group of freelancers roaming the city in search of a story to sell, at any cost, with absolutely no moral sense of right or wrong in relationship to those personally impacted, does not suggest role model main character material to me.  I want a hero I can, in my fantasy, hope to emulate.  Anna does not make the grade.  Therefore, it is truly fitting that she does not get her man in the end who represents everything she is not!  Had I not been exposed to the &quot;Prey&quot; series and the Lucas Davenport character, I may not have been so disappointed	1997-07-11
