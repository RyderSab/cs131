Brian Keene's TERMINAL is a unique piece of horror/thriller fiction..IT COULD BE REAL....and I beleive most of it to have happened.  Powerful is a great description.  Mr. Keene shows us the dark human heart...and can relate with what the author shows us...because it is real. <br /> <br />No purple prose..no zombies...no vampires...no witches. <br /> <br />Just pure honest dreading-the-next-page-but-I-have-to-read-it writing. <br /> <br />Brilliant.	2005-05-31

If you thought THE RISING was the best zombie novel...you were wrong....the sequel, CITY OF THE DEAD is better than that, the writing is crisper, the plot more interesting and the characters something out of real life.  Keene doesn't flinch and definitely tears up new ground with CITY OF THE DEAD. <br /> <br />And this time there's very little wriggle room at the end. <br /> <br />One of the best novels of 2005...actually it is 2nd to Brian Keene's TERMINAL, which is pure magic.

Andrew Harper (Douglas Clegg's alter ego)returns with a not-inclusive sequel to BAD KARMA with RED ANGEL.  The idea behind these books is to craft a fast-paced, character driven story that you can read in 2-3 sittings.  And Harper demands that you stay with the story with enough twist and turns to dare you to try and quit reading.  The he throws in enough character development to flesh out the main players all the while twisting your stomach with gut wrenching scenes of torture and murder!  The plot is straight forward, the climax worthwhile and most importantly, the characters stay true throughout the novel...they don't have a revelation that is &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;cute&quot;.  This is lean prose by a master writer.  I would recommend any of Douglas Clegg's books after you finish this one....the Clegg books are more richly woven tales but RED ANGEL is a showcase of a imaginative writer on top of his craft!	2003-12-12

And THE HOUR BEFORE DARK may be his best!  Dealing with past family crimes that come to a head in a pretty fantastic climax, with characters that are real and stay true throughout the book, and a father figure that is straight out of mine and many other's lives and you've got a novel you can't and won't want to put down!  Simply stated Clegg always raises the standard of horror and puts his own identifying spin on classic topics in the genre.  Read anything by Clegg as soon as possible, he is that good.  And please don't let the bomb reviews sway your opinion, these were left by a very jealous writer who is known to tear down successful writers' books as his own languish in the remainder bin and gather well-deserved dust!	2003-11-21
US	52501264	R1HDKDMDVNX0HR	0451202538	767468281	Hangman	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Slade's best book to date!!	Michael Slade is a genre unto himself.  He writes historical horror.  His novels are so detailed in history that each book is a lesson in geography, criminology and jurisprudence.  In the past Slade has focussed on one of these themes and explores them to no end.  This time out HANGMAN unifies them all into his best novel to date.  HANGMAN is a story that researches the history of the Hangman.  From the past to modern times, what I learned was as fascinating as the fictional accounts were bloody.<br />HANGMAN starts out with a convicted child abuser being hanged as his sentence.  While this court-sanctioned penalty is carried out, another hanging is occurring and on the wall, in the victim's own blood, is an invitation for the police to play a game of hangman.  These opening scenes are so vivid, I thought I was watching a movie, the descriptions were so realistic.<br />Another hanging occurs shortly thereafter and are linked to be the work of the same killer but in two countries; the US and Canada.  Who has jurisdiction?  Will both country's top cops work together or split the case?  These are fascinating questions and Slade answers them deftly and with accurate historical information.<br />Not to be lost is Slade's most courtroom-savvy novel.  What transpires in the courts and the lives of the lawyers are as intriguing as the killer and its motives.  Slade gives us everything we could ever want for in a horror/thriller/courtroom drama all wrapped into one.  The Special X division has never had a case like this and you have never read a more satisfying book as this.  Slade is the best kept secret and is destined for huge success.  And he deserves it if he keeps putting out stunners like HANGMAN.	2001-04-06

The premise of this non-fiction, investigative book is to look at some newly released documents that prove the U.S. Government took an active role in overthrowing a foreign ally and as a result, JFK was assassinated.  I found this book to be a fascinating commentary on the behind-the-scenes activities of our elected officials during the early-`60s.  But the book  also contains some answers to the bigger questions that surround JFK's death.<br />THE DEATHS OF THE COLD WAR KINGS is basically the tale of this: US supports Vietnamese President Diem, Diem terrorizes Buddhists and embarrasses US.  Diem cuts deal with Marseille Mob in France to maintain the supply of opium, and thus heroin, harveted and run from South Vietnam to the States through the US Mob.  US green-lights Diem's assassination, successors are worse...we lose Viet Nam War.  The Mobs in France and the US are hurt financially by Diem's overthrow.<br />JFK travels to Dallas and is assassinated three weeks later.  Book shows proof that, within 48 hours of the hit, the US deports a highly sought after foreign terrorist who was in Dallas the day JFK was shot.  Then the authors  reveal the identity of this terrorist and address the motivations of why he would be in Dallas on that very day.  The book also answers questions as to: where is JFK's brain?; how many sets of JFK autopsy photos were submitted?; why was Diem's wife a staunch critic of the America in the US at the time of the Diem coup?; why did the Pope, after a mysterious visit from JFK, recall Diem's brother to the Vatican at the onset of the coup?; and more.  Oswald's credibility as a sniper is also re-examined, and there's a detailed account (the first in book-form, I believe) of the Dealey Plaza re-enactment of 1998. <br />We can only hope that, with more and more documents being released, we may one day actually get to the real truth behind JFK's assassination.  Until that time, THE DEATHS OF THE COLD WAR KINGS is the closest we've come yet.	2001-04-05

Jeffery Deaver gives us a tale about the past never being dead, revenge and that sometimes you CAN talk your way out of the most dire of circumstances.  SPEAKING IN TONGUES is Deaver at his thriller-writing best with characters that resonate long after the book is finished, a plot that will leave you guessing up to the final shocking page and an experience only Deaver can deliver.<br />Tate Collier, a lawyer, gets caught up in a chase to save his daughter, Megan, who has disappeared.  Along the way we meet Aaron Mathews, a psychologist who has a mental problem and Bett, Tate's ex-wife and mother of Megan.<br />Megan is acting out trying to deal with her less than honorable mother and never-there dad.  She is ordered to meet with a psychologist which she does...until strangely, a new doctor meets her...then she disappears.  Tate and Bett start looking for her and in doing so uncover a daughter neither of them knew and are ashamed of.  <br />When the plot is reveled you will be shocked, mad and denying that something like this could ever occur.  The next to final scene is as moving as I have ever encountered in a novel.  Jeffery Deaver returns to his genre-blasting roots and gives us another stellar novel.	2001-01-23

Dean Koontz returns to the top of the suspense genre with this tale of stalking, spirituality and hope.  FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE is a moving experience that will make you think about your place in life, your meaning in this world and the next.  He gives us a reading experience unlike any other, and delivers his trademark thrillerisms.<br />The book starts out with a boy, Bartholomew, being born right after a tragic car crash.  Koontz follows his growth; from his uncanny ability to walk &quot;between the rain drops&quot; to losing his eyesight at age 3 to his final confrontation.  <br />Also involved is the Pie Woman, Bart's mother, who is Koontz' showing of a pure-hearted person.  We also get two cleverly written brothers of the Pie Woman; one who rattles off historical natural disasters and the other who lists horrendous crimes perpetrated by humans in our long bloody lineage.<br />Koontz also gives us Angel, a child born around the same time as Bart in a different town and a result of a very horrific crime.  Though they do share an ability to be revealed in the book...not here.<br />And at the center of it all is a psycho called Junior.  The things this guy does goes beyond understanding and is just pure evil.  Chasing him is a former priest turned cop who gets mixed up on the wrong side with Junior.  Ah, but revenge is sweet!<br />Koontz pulls out all the stops to join these differing characters, staying true to all the characters' motivations and not changing them to fit a certain situation...they act they way they would throughout...consistently.<br />This book has an underlying theme about Quantum Physics possibly proving parallel worlds do exist and certain people can visit them.  Also is a humane idea that each person, whether they do good or bad, influences many other people that can't be considered.  All in all this is the most satisfying Koontz book in years.<br />Well-written, a plot worthy of all 623 pages, characters to live through and fight against and a moral that can be learned from as well as taught to others, FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE is the way to truly ring in the New Millennium. Highest Recommendation.	2001-01-23

US	52501264	RLYHIPWBZ2WGT	0679463321	565707898	Killing Time	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Ambitious but messy sci fi novel.	I agree with most of the other readers' comments.  The idea about how the Internet could be overtaken by one group and then used to throw the world in chaos by illusionary &quot;discoveries&quot;( that are forged) is unique and interesting.  Unfortunately, the characters and their motivations are not!  We never get to care for the people in the book because they are all bad in some way.  The only interesting plot line was the one in Africa...and that's 25 pages til the end.  Even chasing Dov was boring and the result predicatable and not enlightening.  Totally dissappointed by this author who's last 2 books were brilliant.  I wonder if this being a serialized novel in the magazine TIME first was part of the problem??  Just a mess, really. Buy THE WALKING by Bentley Little instead.	2000-11-26
US	52501264	R16ZYKXFS9VV7G	0684853523	44310359	On Writing:  A Memoir of the Craft	Books	5	2	3	N	N	King as a wise teacher!!	Stephen King gives us an introspective look on the craft of writing, his personal accounts of some of his legendary novels and an eerie look into the accident last year that almost ended his life. ON WRITING is not just a how-to manual, it is not an autobiography and it certainly is not a new novel to devour. It is an intimate look into the processes that go into being one of the widest read authors ever.<br />The first section of this memoir is about the childhood and adolescence of Mr. King. He goes into depth at how his young days were spent at the hospital, either through his own acts (wiping his rear with poison ivy) or things he couldn't control (serious ear infections). He also lets us in on how his mother's life and, ultimately, her death greatly affected him. He also details how his own vanity press novels sold well to relatives and classmates. This lets us see the development of a young King and his influences that shaped his imagination.<br />The second part is about the craft of writing and King's opinions and advice on this subject. While referring other works, King also illustrates with his own writings. Specifically, THE DEAD ZONE, MISERY, THE STAND and BAG OF BONES are discussed at length. To have King tell us how he &quot;solved&quot; his dilemma in THE STAND; how a nap on an airplane and a feverish writing session in a hotel gave him the tidbits that turned into MISERY; these are priceless moments. The phone call he gets about the paperback rights of CARRIE is touching...and we are there with him and his wife. Also mentioned is the author's battles with cocaine and alcohol addiction. To think that he doesn't remember much of the writing of CUJO is a shame and enforces just what addiction can ruin. All in all, this is the meat of the tome...the master teaches us how he does it and how beginning writers can as well.<br />The last part details King's brush with death. The day his walk turned into a nightmare. An out-of-control van runs King down on acountry road, the people who saved his life and King's own dealings with mortality is harrowing as well as enlightening. A lot of questions I had about this incident were answered and to know that the culprit has died mysteriously in the past weeks adds a shadow of eeriness that chills my blood.<br />Sometimes hilarious, oftentimes insightful and always entertaining, ON WRITING shows Stephen King not only as a writer and student of the craft ...but also a wise teacher.	2000-11-23

As a big fan of Rosenberg's I have to say that this one is unneccessary and just a rehash of the great MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />A virtual blow by blow of critical scenes from MC are listed here.  Some of the dialogue is so brutally verbatim from Propositions and other rote siscussions on criminal law it is boring.<br />That said the rest of the narrative is quite good and moves a pretty good pace.  Nancy's strengths are in building suspense and then letting the action take you on a ride.<br />Unfortunately, Rosenberg should dig up new and original plots and not just regurgitate past glories.	2000-11-08

Winter's introduction, he qoutes a poem about the sounds a ghost makes...tappin and sighing, hence the title.  Like nearly all anthologies their are some good stories, some bad stories, some horrible stories and, gratefully, some top of the line stories.  This collection is about 25% of each.  The bad and horrible stories, however are outweighed by the good and great ones.<br />I found that I championed the more Twilight Zone/trick ending stories over the more experimental ones.  An example of this is Thomas F. Monteleone's contribution, &quot;The Prisoner's Tale, versus Graham Joyce's &quot;Candia&quot;.  Monteleone excellently delivers a straight ahead tale of one prisoner's chance at freedom.  Joyce just delivers a confusing nonlateral tale of deja vu.<br />Poppy Z. Brite shows why she is a favorite among the horror sect in &quot;Nailed&quot;.  A revenge tale with some voodoo thrown in is precise and perfectly laid out and ended.  In  Ramsey Campbell's &quot;Return Journey&quot;, we get a time travelling train that is convuluted and unclear.<br />Graham Masterton gives us a look at what happens to the past if you dare forget it in the terrific, &quot;Spirits of the Age&quot;. ; scary as well as thought-provoking is Ray Garton's &quot;The Homeless Couple&quot; where a man who ignores cries for help from people in need in turns needs help.  Ed Gorman's &quot;Ghosts&quot; is a tale of caution about reprucussions.<br />All in all a recommended collection of differring takes on ghost mythology.	2000-11-08

Harry Crane, while stumbling through the Bottoms, comes across a woman wrapped in razor wire, dead.  She is not the first.  Harry's dad and the town constable, Jacob must find out who is doing the killings.  Trouble is the women is black...at first.  Then the first white woman is found murdered that sets off a racially sensitive murder case.<br />The power of this novel is in Lansdale's storytelling about the realistic views of the times dealing with race, class and goodness.  Harry and Jacob make a good detective team.  And it's fascinating watching how the black town responds and helps the whites in solving this case.  Also of note is the advancement of pathology and forensic science in the black town, as opposed to the slow movement of the white doctors.<br />The ending will shock you, the narrative will remain with you and Joe R. Lansdale's world will make you a better person.  What more could you want from a book?	2000-11-08

His books, for me, either hit all cylinders or are good reads but nothing special.  This one falls in the middle of these two categories.  I loved the last 200 pages or so.  The first 300 are Laymon describing in detail what 3-5 people do in a small town.  It is important to the story but gone are the action scenes and surprises I've come to expect.  Not to say that TTVS is a mess, because it is not.  Laymon's characters are real, flesh and blood...I recognized most of these characters as people I know or have known.  The fight scenes in the cage are vivid, the dialogue throughout hilarious and a plot that keeps moving. Overall not one of the best Laymons but still a very strong book.	2000-10-03

MISCHIEF is Clegg's 2nd take on Harrow, the house that is the focus of THE  NIGHTMARE HOUSE eserial.  This book takes place in the here and now and  follows a teenager, Jim Hook, when he goes to the Harrow Academy after his  brother and father die in a car wreck.  Jim catches the eye of a secret  society on campus and, after going through a series of tests and  initiations, becomes   a member.  The problem is that Jim has the ability  to bring something back from Harrow...something that has been haunting old  Harrow for years.<br />Clegg's take on adolescence is refreshing and  enlightening.  The friends Jim hooks up with all have nicknames and shine  right off the page.  He hits the nail on the head when he discusses the  feelings and ramifications of first loves and falling too hard in love.   The characters are richly defined and seem to come off the page, take your  hand and say, &quot;Here, come with me and I'll show you...&quot;  The  dialogue is crisp and not forced, the internal machinations of Jim are  vivid and understandable.   <br />The best parts of the novel are the scenes  in Harrow and all of the intitiation rituals.  A very literate subplot is  the book, THE INFINITE ONES, that Jim locates in the Harrow library.  My  only bicker is that the book is too short.  Clegg gives us a lot of  glimpses of other characters and their histories with Harrow, yet we are  only given those too-short introductions.  Here's hoping that in the  future, Clegg rereleases this book with ALL of the subplots and characters  fully displayed.<br />For those that don't know Douglas has a loosely built  trilogy that surrounds the Harrow estate.  THE NIGHTMARE HOUSE is an  ongoing eserial right now that looks at the history of Harrow.  MISCHIEF is  the first in-print book and coming in hardcover next Sept. 2001 is THE  INFINITE.  You don't need to read one to get the impact of the others but  it is like visiting an old friend if you do read all three.<br />Douglas Clegg  is thebusiest man in horror right now.  Consider he has put out a  metaphysical meditation on the duality of love and life with THE HALLOWEEN  MAN, a story collection that showed off his range in THE NIGHTMARE  CHRONICLES, an epic horror novel with YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU, NAOMI was  the first horror eserial for free on the internet, THE NIGHTMARE HOUSE is  the 2nd free horror eserial going on now...and all this within the last 2  years or so.  The quantity is remarkable for the quality of the books, each  one is different but all of them satisfy a different urge for the horror  fan.	2000-09-19
US	52501264	R1LLY504TWC4YE	0843947527	402076302	The Deceased	Books	5	24	26	N	N	A mammoth of a horror tale!!	When I started reading the opening chapter of THE DECEASED, I couldn't  tell which, if any, of the characters I was introduced to were alive or  dead...or in some other state. The second chapter explains a few things  about who is and isn't alive. After that, the novel goes down a vortex of  violence, insanity, intensity and just plain vileness. This opus is about  journeys, redemption and confronting the never-dead past. It is literate at  the same time it is violent; clear as the mud some of the characters wallow  in. This is not a linear point A to Point B novel. Hell no! Piccirilli  serves up some great characters, tosses them a ton of plot and masterfully  lets the characters deal with it all to end in a satisfying conclusion. The  story is about Jacob Maelstrom, an author following in his famous father's  footsteps. Both write horror books. Jacob is a survivor of a massacre at  his parents' house in Stonethrow, an island unto itself. Jacob's father  Isaac brought his whole family (wife, wheelchair bound brother Joseph,  sister Rachel and Jacob) there to escape the fandom his writing has  wrought. An attempted kidnapping of Rachel was the last straw for Isaac.  Upon moving in, isolation lends a hand in turning this family onto madness.  Jacob's mom is non confrontational, brother and sister are way too close to  be healthy, and Jacob is a loner trying to fit in. He's the Third, as his  siblings call him, the youngest of three children. Also in the plot is the  agent of both writers, Bob Wakely, his assistant (and concubine) Lisa.  Katie is Lisa's sister, a huge Maelstrom devotee and, oh yeah, just out  from the mental hospital ('The Ding-a-ling wing', as Picirrilli puts it).  Katie is in the hospital for a horrific event in her past that she can't  come to terms with. The house on Stonethrow is a place with a checkered  history to say the least. 10 years ago the Maelstroms were victims of  Rachel's ax attack...decapitating all except Jacob, who survived in a  closet. Rachel's final act was her suicide by the same blade. Jacob has  been renting out the house these past years to other writers of horror who  live in the house for inspiration. Nobody's ever really heard the whole  story, so on the anniversary, Jacob goes back to face his past. Katie is  taken to the house by Lisa. Katie and Jacob share traumatic pasts and,  therefore, a strong bond. How strong is the test. Seems Jacob's family is  coming back for the last surviving member of their clan. Piccirilli's knack  for making all of this believable is genius. On one page he talks about  Lisa's pregnancy, the next part deals with Jacob seeing someone familiar in  a closet. The author switches back and forth between reality and insanity.  Add in a touch of Alice In Wonderland-like fantasy and you have wood  nymphs, aquatic angels, imaginary (or real) friends and enemies. I mean  when is a turtle just a turtle? Overall the narrative shook me up  emotionally and physically, dealing with real issues in a literate and  intelligent way, not condescendingly or shallowly. Tom Piccirilli, with THE  DECEASED, has added to his legacy as the genre's most intense, vivid and  satisfying writers in the horror/dark mystery genre. Highest of  recommendations.	2000-09-13

Ryan helping the Russians with an invading Chinese force in Siberia.  This opus, 1028 pages, read very well and the  action scenes were great.  It's nice to see all the regulars back in  action.  The plot seems very plausible with the Chinese screwing the US out  of trade dollars, etc.  The scenes that were not battle oriented were great  also.  Without giving out any spoilers, the only problem I had was Ryan's  location toward the end of the novel.  It is a bit far fetched and  unbelievable.  Other wise a stunningly brilliant book.  Highest  recommendation.  For reference, the only Clancy book I disliked was DEBT OF  HONOR...all the rest were great!	2000-08-31

RUMBLE TUMBLE is the fifth in the Hap &amp; Leonard series, a mostly  crime/mystery serial. This novel has Hap &amp; Leonard searching for  Brett's, Hap's girlfriend, daughter who has been prostituting for a tough  guy, Big Jim in Oklahoma.  Hap &amp; Leonard run into a colorful cast of  outlaws and outcasts on their search. The climax is when they find Tillie,  Brett's daughter, in a Mexico compound and the surgical strike they perform  is excellent, action-filled drama. Unfortunately, I feel that the dynamic  duo is wearing thin on me, the dialogue, usually so funny, is a bit stale  and feels like we've been there before, which we have. I think if Lansdale  concentrated on some other projects before the next novel, it would help  incredibly. Recommended for Hap &amp; Leonard fans.	2000-08-27
US	52501264	RDFIX43F6VZM4	0671885987	587109324	Robert Bloch's Psychos	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A solid collection from the premier horror writers out there	This is a collection of 22 original stories presented by The Horror  Writers Association.  In the U.S., there are two editions: a paperback and  the limited hardcover put out by Cemetery Dance Publications.  I suggest  picking up the hardcover and I'll explain why later. The big draw to this  one is Stephen King's original appearance of AUTOPSY ROOM 4, a story about  a guy who is not dead but the Dr.'s performing the autopsy think otherwise.   This is one of the better King shorts in a long while and is a fun read.  The best story is Gary Braunbeck's SAFE, a story about how a town tries to  cope and understand a mass murder.  It is told through the eyes of a  relative of the murderer who was saved in the melee and how he is dealing  with the reprucussions of the event years later.  It is an emotionally  wrenching piece and is still reverberating in my body still, a few days  after reading it. Ed Gorman treats us to a &quot;What If&quot; story.  What  if a neighborhood watch group actually killed a thief and the thief's  accomplices try to enact revenge?  It's a great premise and Gorman delivers  a stunning story. Clark Perry also tells a story of childhood guilt that  still haunts the living.  This one was written so well I actually missed an  appointment because I was so engrossed in the character's lives.  I wish  more of Mr. Perry's stuff would see the light of a day.  A very talented  writer. Other standout stories are put out by Yvonne Navarro, David Niall  Wilson, Del Stone Jr. Cindie Geddes and Richard Christian Matheson.  There  really was not a story I didn't enjoy in here.  A very good collection and  one not to be skipped. Now for the reason I suggest the hardcover edition.  Cemetery Dance Publications has made this book look very unique. And it has  nothing to do with the Eric Powell cover, even though it is great and  alluring.  It has to do with the inside of the book. Obviously, Richard  Chizmar took great care in designing the pages, as they are decorated with  little illustrations by Jason Van Hollander.  At each page corner there are  these creepy characters and at the end of each story a little haunted  house.  The end papers also have some great illustrations by Allen  Koszowski that show the face of the late Robert Bloch and some of his and  others' characters. A very nice looking edition that you'll appreciate for  years to come. Highly recommended and highest recommendation for buying the  hardcover edition.	2000-08-27

RED SHADOWS is a follow up to FINAL IMPACT, where a rogue planet crashes  into the Earth.  Before DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON, Navarro weaved a tale  of survival.  In RED SHADOWS we find out how well the survivors are doing  and what they are doing to stop a plague. Navarro has been totally  underrated in the women of horror movement of the `90's.  We all know about  Brite, Koja, Kiernan and Faust.  But please add Navarro as an heir to their  throne. This novel is an excellently written, character-driven story.  The  people in this novel live and breathe and you feel for them when some of  their decisions are made. Emotionally engaging. Highest Recommendation.	2000-08-19

She could publish her grocery list and I'd buy it. Having said that, her collection from Gauntlet Press is a tad uneven. The great stories are here;Arise, Self-Made man, Saved,Pin Money and  Mussolini and the Axeman's Jazz.  All are great genre-breaking tales.  But  some of the others seem to be just ramblings, incoherent musings at best.  And if someone can tell me what Peter Straub's  introduction was meant to do, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Caitlin Kiernan's  afterword is a fun reminiscence on her first meeting Ms. Brite. Recommended  for fans of Poppy Z. Brite, only.	2000-08-19

Some  jail informant has alleged that Wyatt's client confessed to being the ALLEY  SLASHER, a serial killer that has the whole town scared.<br />Freedman mixes  in some incredible police work, plot twists you will not believe and  characters that are shady yet compelling.

GUESTS is a haunted house story, a &quot;possessed&quot; story and also a story about religious conviction or lack thereof.<br />Unfortunately, it is  also a novel that does not combine these elements into a believable  narrative.<br />GUESTS opens with Gregory winning the California lottery,  $40,000 a year for 20 years.  And this convinces both Greg and his wife  Julia to quit their jobs and move as soon as possible.. And that's the  first problem.  I could see one person quitting their job, not both, but  that's just my opinion.<br />On we go to follow this family moving to Arizona,  a small town called McGuane...&quot;a haunted place&quot; as one character  sums up the town.  This is a town that Greg grew up in and has a sordid  history of religious intolerance.  Greg's family is of Russian molokan  descent, a culture that is richly described in this book, being part of  Little's ancestry.<br />The town has culture lines firmly drawn and 25 years  has not changed that aspect.  All that's needed is for some conflict to  occur, and the town will pick its favorites.<br />As soon as Greg's family  moves into a house where brutal infanticide occurred a while back, strange  murders start to happen to the people of McGuane...and you know who gets  blamed.<br />Next problem is the believability of the real reason for these  murders...it is a very thin thread to tie this book's plot around and, for  me, it didn't do so convincingly.<br />Little's prose is crackling with life  and his scenes are described vividly, but it's just that I wasn't buying  what Little was selling in this novel.  For those looking for the  traditional Little gore factor, I must inform you that, except for a few  early and ending deaths, this is a strongly character-driven piece.<br />It's  not that I hated the book, far from it.  But being one of his biggest fans,  I know he can and has come up with better plots...this just isn't one of  them. Recommended for Little fans.	2000-08-19

Matthew leaves, but after 5 years, returns to  Summerfell to right some wrongs that happened during his high school years.  In between, Piccirilli dreams up some of the most vile, hateful and vivid  scenes of horror I've ever read.  Think his DARK FATHER was intense?  Check  out HEXES! Characters that are all too-real, scenarios that are out of  whack but realistically rendered and a climax to end all climaxes..   Researched in occultism well, HEXES succeeds on all levels.

Williamson returns with another stunning chapter in this trilogy. In the  previous book, CITY OF IRON, we were left with The Survivor gone to who  knows where.  In this book the trio find him and now has to deal with the  havoc he doles out. This novel is interesting because of the internal  struggle of the three members of the Searchers group.

Repairman Jack, Wilson's series character, returns to enact his special blend of vengeance and justice.  Seems that there is a new drug, called  Berzerk, that makes the user's strength and violence soar.  The source of  this new drug is an old enemy of Jack's past.  The holder of this source is  the basis for Wilson's edited HWA-sponsored anthology, FREAK SHOW.   <br />Wilson's strength is not letting Jack do the same old thing time and  again.  Jack is evolving and realizing his place in his battle versus the  Otherness, the ultimate evil in this world.  Jack is asked by 2 people to  check out a Bosnian gangster, one a researcher for a pharmaceutical  company, the other a regular guy looking for vengeance.  Both characters  add local color and a unique outside experience of Jack and his methods.   <br />Repairman Jack's hijinks to get under the skin of the gangster are the  highlights here, as they are in all of the linked books.  Wilson's  imagination is used full force here....as elaborate as dropping tires and  oil onto a houseful of party guests, to something simple like disabling a  surveilance car.<br />Wilson's blending -in of his other novels and stories is  masterful.  You see characters and hints from his previous works to make a  complete history.  A great novel in a continuing series.<br />This edition  also includes, at the end, an interview with Mr. Wilson that is  informative.  The artwork, by Harry O. Morris, is not the usual sketches  but a kind of J.K. Potter meshing of images...very effective. Highly  Recommended.	2000-08-19

Bryan gets a call to meet his just-released-from-jail brother, Rick to meet at a  motel.  They haven't seen or talked to one another since Rick was put in  jail for murder.  Rick claimed a mysterious Jude Fairclough drew him into  her spell to kill, while Bryan finds that hard to believe. The story takes  you on what happened that night in the past and what happens after Rick  gets out.  This 9,000 word story tears your heart out as we sympathize with  Bryan's choices in how to deal with Rick.  But we also can see how Rick got  to be where ends up.

THE HALLOWEEN MAN is a tale, broad in scope, that meditates on the duality  of evil vs good.  It's epic in it's attempt to pull together a myriad of  characters, histories of people and places and consequences. It is a tale  of a town, Stonehaven, and its mysteries.  It's a tale of Stony Crawford's  life and what happened to him at age 15 and what was let loose.  It's how  he deals with what he is and what he will, eventually, become.  It's about  love. It's about good and it's about evil. But above all, it is a great  success. Stonehaven, like most towns, has secrets.  But these are old  secrets, even ancient.  One man, Alan Fairclough, hunts out a myth...but  finds it to be true.  A weaver (or &quot;spinner&quot;)of tall tales, Nora  Chance, tries to tell Stony the truth about him and his heritage.  She also  spins on about The Halloween Man and his place in the world, past and  present.  But Stony is the main point of this novel.  His travels, his  actions and his ultimate honesty with himself and those like him. Sorry if  this is vague, but I don't want to ruin the joys, anguish and redemptive  powers this novel contains.  Douglas Clegg has raised the stakes: for  himself,  as well as for the genre he writes in. Recommended.	2000-08-19

EXTREMITIES is a collection of 14 reprints and 2 originals.  All are  excellent. These are mostly tales of fantasy with a dash of internal  psychodrama thrown in to concoct a potion so alluring that I read the whole  collection in one sitting. Koja has a way of spitting out a simple scene  and taking it to it's totally  unexpected ends. For example, &quot;The  Neglected Garden&quot;: a husband wants to divorce his wife, she doesn't  want to, so she impales herself on the back fence and the husband watches  as days go by.  Simple enough premise, right?  But what's inside these two  characters, how do they cope with one's &quot;suicide&quot; so public, what  happens when a neighbor or friend sees her?  That's the magic of Koja's  writing...always wanting to know &quot;what next?&quot;. Another tale,  &quot;Bird Superior&quot; asks, &quot;What if a plane crash survivor is  given the &quot;gift&quot; of flight?  How would you deal with it?  Could  you handle it?  Koja looks at it and the conclusion is mind-bending. These  are but 2 examples of Kathe Koja's artistry in the short form.  A great  introduction to those of you have heard of, but not yet undertaken a Koja  novel.  To Koja fans like myself, this is a treat of the mind and soul.  Highest Recommendation.	2000-08-19

Then the search begins for the killer.  What happens before the finding of  the bodies is the belly of this beast.  A lot of superfluous details about  characters history, lives, etc is not needed.  The ending is so not  dramatic or incisive, the twists and hints of who the killer may be are  completely false and forced.  The fist and last 1/3 of this book are  tedious, the middle part actually had a head of steam going until we are  bogged down with unnecessary information.

In this one, Martin wins a RICO case in small town America, then is offered a chance to be Asst. Attorney General of the U.S. to set up a RICO case against a hate  group called The Sanctuary.  The majority of the story is about the members   of The Sactuary and how they got to be where they are.  A lot of action  filled robberies and military expeditions flavor this novel.  And Aaron  Stampler does return.  This piece is written more in the style and research  of Tom Clancy.  A lot of politics and military aspects are covered.   Diehl's back stories and flashbacks to flesh out the characters and their  motivations is a strong point.  The conclusion is sad , true and too  frequently real.<br />A different Diehl but a great book.	2000-07-21

Simon Clark's 1st novel, published in the States for the first time, is a great debut.  Going in, you know that with first novels you will get a bit of overwriting and a too-broad scope that a first time novelist can't  handle.  If you expect these shortfalls, then NAILED BY THE HEART is going  to be a pleasurable experience.<br />The plot consists of a family who have  invested everything they have, monetarily and emotionally, into an island  sea fort off the coast of England.  The sea fort it turns out,  has a long  history of mythical beliefs and the town that surrounds it is attracting  people with addictions...deep, dark addictions.  The family gets bits and  pieces of the truth from the townsfolk.  <br />A race of people called the Saf  Dar are mythological warriors, they have aided in toppling some of the most  famous governments throughout the ages.  They disappeared  awhile  ago...only to be resurrected off the coast of this sea fort.  They stand  and stare from the ocean at the sea fort and its inhabitants.<br />Then  attack! <br />Clark maintains the level of suspense by putting believable  characters in situations that are interesting and vivid.  The hints of what  the Saf Dar are and how they can, or can't, be killed are slow in coming  but pacing is not Clark's strong point here.  He thrives on scenes and this  novel is more about action than pace.<br />This is not Clark's best novel,  that would be KING BLOOD, but this is a good introduction to American  readers.  Be patient with Leisure Books and pick up this one, then wait  until they release the next Simon Clark book...you will not be let down.	2000-07-21

Brite's answer to her self -asked question, What if John Lennon and Paul McCartney had been lovers?  Brite fictionalizes John and Paul with Seth and ? , a couple of English boys in early 60's  England.  They meet, realize they make a great musical pair, start a band  called the KYDDS, make great music, lots of money and tour.  <br />The  homosexual aspect is interesting in how Brite shows how attitudes change,  however small, in people once they know or work with a gay male.  The best  thing about this novella is how Brite uses the backdrop of the Stonewall  riots as the KYDDS' coming out party.  In the end, the cliche &quot;the  more things change the more they stay the same&quot; is all too painfully  true.<br />The ending is smart and true to the theme of the whole piece.   Poppy also illustrates the book using some very kidlike drawings...at first  glance they are very simple, but upon further reflection they are  charismatic and intuitive.<br />Overall a great piece of fiction from a  favorite of mine.  The artwork by the author herself is an added bonus that  you can't pass up.	2000-07-21

This was published just before Jeffery Deaver got &quot;bestseller&quot; status and it is a good, solid read.  Better than PRAYING FOR SLEEP but a little below anything after A MAIDEN'S GRAVE.  That being said, I enjoyed  this book.  The first 1/4 is a bit slow with set-ups and a whole bunch of  different characters.  But once Deaver throws them all together, the ride  really picks up!   I can see parts of THE EMPTY CHAIR in this novel and  even Rhyme's motto about evidence is worshipped of the lead Detective in  this one. The plot is basically a whodunit...being who killed a college  girl, another girl a year earlier, who's leaving polaroid pictures of the  Detective's little girl IN HIS HOUSE and signed with threats?   A lot of  questions and the 517 paperback pages are needed to answer them all.  Just  when you think you have it all figured out, Deaver throws in his patented  twists and turns and you don't know which side is up!   A very solid and  enjoyable read.

Along the way  we meet some colorful characters with witty dialogue. The plot involves a  couple of Mafiaoso hits, one that goes wrong and a million dollars that may  or may not be real as a treasure.  Deaver throws in some twists at the end  that are great.  It's not like his last 7 books or so...more straight  forward and slim.

US	52501264	R2H4AQSQR0OK36	0684855631	430524886	The Empty Chair	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Deaver returns with a gutty novel!	Deaver has given us another Rhyme/Sachs book.  This one takes us to North Carolina where Lincoln wants to try an experimental surgery to help him regain any mobility.  He is then thrust into a criminal investigation  involving dead kids and kidnappings.  What follows is a tour de force of  evil in a small town.  The best aspect of this novel is that Rhyme is out  of his element ( New York City) but still must use his vast knowledge of  trace evidence to locate the killer(s).  Amelia is a strong character and  does something so surprising that it pits Rhyme vs Sachs in a battle of the  minds and convictions of the soul.  Deaver has let both of these characters  grow up and evolve and their love for each other is gettting closer to  fruition.  The secret of this town seems pretty small...until Deaver lets  us know what is REALLY going on here...the implications are far reaching,  indeed. I enjoyed the character of Garrett, who is a master of insects. The  first 40 pages or so are a bit slow but after a certain capture, the novel  hits its speed and you can NOT put it down. Looking forard to SPEAKING IN  TONGUES in December! Buy it now!	2000-07-03

I've read all of the INSTINCT books and must say that this is a very literary and well-written novel.  This one is set in London, England and follows evil in a few disguises...the twist of who actually is behind the  murders is good.  The only bad part was the story of TATOO MAN, I don't  think that should have been in this one, a waste of space.  I'm glad Walker  decided not to tell us who the killer is, like he's done in the past books.   I like a little whodunnit in my suspense books I read.<br />Walker's  knowledge of English terms and language is masterful, Jessica's dillemas  are all to real and the outcome leaves me wanting more of this  series.<br />I'm currently hunting down any and all of Walker's other books  and look forward to his next one.

This is my 4th Deaver book and I have to say that this one grabbed me like A MAIDEN'S GRAVE.  The whole idea of one criminal dying while the other continues to kill and can't stop until he hears from his partner is  frightening.  Parker Kincaid is a solid character and I'd like to see more  of him.  Seems that the non-Ryme books are a bit more original than the  former's series.  This one had me sitting up late at night reading until I  couldn't stand it!  A lot of knowledge about document handling is presented  and the final reslovement was brilliant and unforseen.  Deaver is, right  now, an obsession of mine and I am curently reading his latest, THE EMPTY  CHAIR, while hunting down any/all of his other books.  Do yourself a favor  and read this and any Deaver book.  highly recommended!	2000-06-28

THAT'S NOT MY NAME starts off with a bang...a child is kidnapped.  Move forward 15 or so years and another woman is taken from a convenience store.  Connected?  And if so..how? Navarro introduces to us Jesse Waite, who in a  fit of despair and obsession, takes another man's wife thinking she is his  own wife, who has been missing the past three months. Jesse then locks Nola  in his house and explains to her, through pictures and half-remembered  memories, that Nola is really Stacey, Jesse's wife of 4 years.  Navarro  weaves an interesting scenario and gives out clues throughout the narrative  as to what is really going on here.<br />The author has a tough road ahead,  trying to convince the reader that this really could and can happen.  The  scent of reality permeates this story and is hard to believe this wasn't  motivated by a real life occurence. The characters are completely three  dimensional, their motivations realistic and the dialogue crisp.  We are  introduced to a dedicated cop, Nola's husband and a host of whacked out  relatives of Stacey's.  These people help push along the story and never  let it drag on.<br />The last 1/4 of this novel has such an astonishing number  of revelations, some that I figured out but others that were just shocking.  Navarro has written a  mystery/suspense novel that will keep you guessing  long into the night.  Get comfortable when you start this one, you will be  there for a long, fulfilling ride with a talented writer who delivers in a  big way.	2000-06-06

I read about a book a week, mostly in the dark fantasy/horror vein and this book is the best one I've read in months!  Massie's genius is in the way that, even though we see parts of the future story, she still makes it  interesting and throws in some twists that can't be forseen. I've always  loved the idea of a family reunion at the start of a novel and this was a  first for me.  Massie's characters are real and the motivations ring true,  we know why they do what they do and it can be justified. This is one scary  and unputdownable horror novel, way better than her first one, SINEATER. Go  buy it!	2000-06-01

In typical Laymon fashion, we start the novel during an abbreviated sex act.  Albert Prince is trying to lose his virginity, but the girl he's with wants  more money than he currently has so Albert leaves her.  On his way home  Albert has an encounter that makes us understand he's not a nice boy.  And  that he will return...with hatred.<br />Janet Arthur wakes up next to her  boyfriend, Dave.  She tells him a secret, he kicks her out.  Janet moves in  with Meg.  Lester and Helen are married, in words only.  Helen's a  &quot;cold fish&quot; and Lester has resorted to an affair.  Emily Jean is  an older woman with a daughter who is just starting to catch her break in  the movie business.  Ian's a writer.  All of these people are put together  through work, circumstances or nefarious ways.<br />CUTS is set in 1975 and  the book has the slow, pot-induced, haziness aspect to the narrative.   Laymon takes a bit more time than usual to flesh out all the characters and  giving them enough life so I could get a good feel for each's  idiosyncracies.  I knew how they should act, react and deal with each other  and in dire circumstances.  <br />The genius in this book is the patience  Laymon had to roll these characters out, not hurry them to join them all  together, and let circumstance take over and let be what is to be.  It's a  bit frustrating, trying to figure out what all of these people are doing in  this novel: but Laymon's deft skill of pulling you in is addictive and you  can't stop reading.  You need to know what happens next.<br />Laymon's a  master of subtlety when it comes to understanding the way humans deal with  each other.  Many times, during a dialogue scene, Laymon will have the  characters think sexy thoughts about one and all, even if they aren't in  the direct conversation.  This makes the characters more human and  believable.<br />CUTS is a step in the right direction for Richard Laymon.It  is a novel that hits you in places untouched.  It doesn't make you feel  good because there is almost no cause for the terror that is being wrought.   Laymon has delivered a subtle horror story with a fairly high body count.   And he's only beginning, heh heh.  Be afraid...be very afraid! Highest  Recommendation.	2000-05-23

This is a tribute anthology inspired by the works of Clark Ashton Smith.  Having not read one piece of fiction by Smith, I anticipated missing some of the underlying themes.  This was not the case.  John Pelan has selected  stories that while being in the tradition of Smith's stylings is easily  accessible to those of us not entrenched in the ways of Clark Ashton  Smith's fiction.  As in all anthologies there are gems, good stories and a  few dogs.  This collection has a higher incidence of the first two.<br />David  B. Silva's &quot;Where The Past Lay Buried&quot; is an effective meditation  on guilt and the price it extolls.  Geoff Cooper's &quot;The Jolerarymi's  Rose&quot;, a sculptor is betrayed by his wife and he enacts revenge.   Edward Lee &amp; John Pelan's &quot;The Scarlet Succubus&quot; waxes poetic  on politics, betrayal and some evil aquatic monsters.  This one takes you  one way then twists the ending so you don't know which way is up.   &quot;Ashes of Longing, Ashes of Lust&quot; is a fast moving, beautifully  written selection that made me feel I was beside the characters.  Here you  find a man on a mission and the toll an old girlfriend's last wish takes on  him.  Mark McLaughlin spins a tale of obsession in &quot;The Vainglorious  Simulacrum of Mungha Sorcyllamia&quot;.  Brian Stableford turns in a  stellar novella of passion, love and betrayal in &quot;The Light of  Achernar&quot;.<br />Other standout tales are written by Charlee Jacob, David  Niall Wilson, Gerard Houarner, Dan Clore, and Gene Wolfe.  The book  contains some outstanding cover art by Rob Alexander and some nice interior  illustrations by Fredrik King and Allen Koszowski. Highly Recommended.	2000-05-23

That in itself is enough irony for me.  Jack has a missing woman case.  To solve it, he must subject himself to unbelievable theories  and people.  But the truth really is stranger than fiction.  When Jack  stumbles across the meaning of it all, it is one of the best moments in  contemporary fiction.  The only real problem I had with this book is that  the time line is somewhat confusing.  Wilson told me that it follows  LEGACIES, which followed THE TOMB.  He sprinkles mentions of previous Jack  novels but it's not exactly clear which one, if any, is which. That aside,  I love it that Wilson has another supernatural-type book out, I was getting  tired of the medical thrillers he's been writing.  The sequel to  CONSPIRACIES should be great based on what Wilson has gotten Jack into  here. Can't wait! Recommended.	2000-05-23

The next  problem is the getaway car crashes, killing one of Bill's friends and the  chase through a swamp kills the other friend.  Not to mention a cop  accidentally kills himself trying to take down Bill.  All this and Bill  ends up in a freak show carnival.  Huh? Trust me, this novel is action  packed and filled with allusions to Jesus Christ, Judas Iscariot and a host  of colorful characters that make this one of Lansdale's best novels in  years.

Stephen King returns with a melancholy look at growing up in the shadow of The Vietnam War and the 1960's.  HEARTS IN ATLANTIS consists of 5 pieces of fiction, all tied together with characters appearing in different  selections.  The book is told in chronological fashion, starting with 1960  and ending in 1999.<br />&quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; is a 254 novella  that introduces us to Bobby Garfield, an 11 year old growing up without a  father figure.  The tale meditates on the themes of whom to trust, who the  real threats in life are and that you can never go back to a time when  things seemed similar.<br />Bobby meets a new tenant in his building, a Ted  Brautigan, who shows up from seemingly out of nowhere to befriend Bobby.   Ted shows and tells Bobby that Low Men in Yellowcoats are following him and  for Bobby to keep out for signs of their coming.  Bobby does this but it  doesn't stop the inevitable finding of Ted by these Low Men.  Bobby  eventually loses his innocence in this story and moves on.  As a side note,  followers of King's DARK TOWER series will see some interesting and  familiar trappings in this story.<br /> Up next is the title story, which  shows us Bobby in college six years later.  He gets mixed up in the  addicting game of Hearts and his grades go south.  More importantly Bobby  and his cohorts find out that they have the power of protest, be it the war  or addressing their own scholastic fates.<br />1983 is the year that  &quot;Blind Willie&quot; takes place.  We follow an old nemesis of Bobby's  past, Willie Shearman, as he goes through a three person transformation.   He goes from Bill, dutiful husband to Willie Shearman, a hard working joe  to Blind Willie, a panhandler.  It is the most depressing and moving piece  due to the effects of guilt, war and lack of respect have on Bill.<br />John  Sullivan is the central character in &quot;Why We're in Vietnam&quot;.   This starts off at a fellow Vietnam Vet's funeral where the past istoo  much to take for John.  He meets up with some other soldiers from that time  and he notices certain commonalities among them all.  This is a sobering  look at what our government exposed our boys in Viet Nam to and the effects  it has on them all.  The ending of this story connects directly with the  last part.  The third to the last paragraph in &quot;Why We're in  Vietnam&quot; sums up this book.  Look it up, read it and hope we don't  fall to the same Fates that that generation did.<br />&quot;Heavenly Shades of  Night are Falling&quot; is the end piece of this work.  It ties up all the  loose ends...almost.  Bobby comes back to his hometown of 1960 to notice  the changes, meet up with old friends, and discover what he and the rest of  his generation accomplished...or didn't accomplish.  A bit of hope at the  end of HEARTS IN ATLANTIS makes this book a standout.  King accomplishes  something unique: an entertaining but thought provoking heart tugger piece  of fiction.  Highly Recommended.	2000-05-23

I couldn't find one character that I thought was worth rooting for.  They all were a little bit evil.  But this is no tale of supernatural evil, oh no.  This is about the  evil of addiction; be it alcohol, drugs, love, sex, violence.  Whatever  vice you've heard of, it's in here. Jessie, a recovering alkie, hooks up  with Simon, a power junkie.  Match made in Hell, right? Yep. Jessie and  Simon's past are ripped right from the Dysfunctional As Hell Family  Handbook. Simon wants Jessie pure, so he decides to eliminate all of her  previous addictions...like sex, like group sex. It all ends with Jessie  trying to save her father and son from the maniac Simon...but then the  question is, &quot;Who's gonna save us from Jessie's kid?&quot; Again, this  is an unflinching look at everyday horror.  Lucy's strength is that she  does not pretty up the problems with these people.  She wallows in it,  shows us the pain and torment with an unflinching eye to detail. The art  inside the book is very well done by Jamie Oberschlake.  And the cover and  author's picture is done by Alan M. Clark, a very nice job! I, personally,  did not buy into Jessie's ongoing attraction to Simon.  But as I discussed  this with someone I respect, he said it's probably because I was lucky  enough never to have been involved in that kind of relationship. All told,  a novel that I can't say I liked, due to it's graphic nature.  If you liked  Jack Ketchum's THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, then this is right up your  garbage-strewn alley. Recommended but with warning.	2000-05-23

Why wasit written, published and sold to the public. It's about a girl whogets lost in the woods and listens to Red Sox baseball games to get her through her ordeal...THAT'S IT! A short story at best! Some King *scholars* will no doubt talk about the piece as being about survival, etc.  I found it to be a quick read with no redeeming rewards.  Just a cash cow. That being said, I love King's work.  But this novel and his short story, &quot;L.T.'s Theory of Pets&quot; have just been worthless slices of the King pie. Not recommended to even your worst enemy.	2000-05-23

ROT is a tale of Kyle Brubaker, who will become a man over a summer's vacation from college.  Kyle has to help out his Uncle Bob's farm  after Bob's stroke.  He gets involved with Bob's son's girlfriend,   Marianne and the action goes from there.   Kyle and Marianne go to a  carnival, get into some heavy trouble with some very unscrupulous brothers  and then Kyle, in a split-second, must make a decision that will affect all  of their lives.  Needless to say Kyle makes the wrong choice and the  downward spiral is started. You see, Marianne is brought back from the  dead...and she wants revenge on the brothers...and Kyle! This is a  well-written, fast paced novel.  The characters are real and the situations  Brandner puts them in is rivetting.  The consequences are justified and the  ending is a killer! Vince Natale's cover is an eye-grabber, as is the  interior drawings by Keith Minnion.  Another winner by Cemetery Dance  Publications. Highest recommendation.	2000-05-23

Vol. 2 of The Lost Lansdale series is a children's story.  It's a skimpy tale of innocence and growing up, of adults vs. kids and just a smooth story that only Joe Lansdale could pull off.<br />The neighborhood is looking sick...and 2 boys decide it is because of a new house that showed up  recently and without any of the adult's noticing.  The kids decide to stalk  it at night to see if what they think is true.<br />What they find out is so  out-of-this-world and unbelievable that when they are confronted with  saving their neighborhood, all they can do is go by instinct.

This is subtitled as &quot;A Roundup of Weird Westerns&quot; and &quot;Down-N-Dirty Tall Tales&quot;.  I agree with both descriptions and lean toward the latter as better served as what is contained within.  13  tales as tall as the nearest skyscraper from some of the more notorious  weave-spinners around.  As with most anthologies there are some that are  great, some good and a few not so good.<br />Let's focus on the great, shall  we?   Brian Hodge has the unenviable task of having the leadoff story,   &quot;Pages Stuck by a Bowie Knife to a Cheyenne Gallows&quot;.  A tale of  a cowboy unable to be killed.  The genius of the story is Hodge's  explanation of how this predictament came to be and how the man handles it.   A very disturbing moment is Hodge's description of the condition.  The  retribution he must pay for his past deeds make him a living  allegory.<br />Richard Laymon's &quot;The Hangman&quot; spins a yarn of a  revengeful hanged ghost.  Laymon has one of the hunted meet a father and  son out camping and telling them what/who is trailing him.  A armful of  gooseflesh follows, especially with the eerie ending.<br />&quot;The Magic  Bullet Theory&quot; by Adam-Troy Castro is a very original and vivid tale  of a bullet that was shot by a stranger in town, moves about an inch a year  down the center of Main Street and how one or two people look death in the  face by staring the bullet down.  <br />Nancy A. Collins turns in a solid take  on Day of the Dead in &quot;Calaverada&quot;.  Yvonne Navarro's  contribution, &quot;Divine Justice&quot; asks the question, what if you and  a friend came across something that resembled a whole hell of a lot like an  Angel?   The answer is intriguing.  <br />Robert Devereaux' &quot;Showdown at  Stinking Springs&quot; is the last piece of this Weird Western puzzle and  it is an over the top meditation on what happens when one nymphomaniacal  woman and one well endowed man meet in the center of town for a shootout,  so to speak.   Hilarious stuff!<br />What may be the best thing about this  collection is at the end of every story is the author's most up to date  bibliography, a very handy tool to hunt down fiction and non-fiction by  your favorite writers.  An all around good anthology and hopefully more  with this theme will be released in the not too distant future.	2000-05-18

BLOOD DANCE is the fourth volume of Subterranean Press' Lost Lansdale Series.  In the introduction Joe Lansdale, his ownself, outlines the details of how this novel came to see the light of day 17 years after it  first sold.  This is a great piece of non fiction that helps the reader  understand where the author was in his stage of writing and also gives a  little insight into the novel itself.<br />BLOOD DANCE is a western with no  supernatural aspects.  It's a tall tale from  Jim Melgrhue's perspective of  the events of the time.  Jim and his buddy,  Bob Bucklaw are down on their  luck, tired of mining and come across one of Carson's party who offers them  a job, sight and details undisclosed.  Jim &amp; Bob take him up on it,  only to find out the job is robbing a train loaded with gold.  Only problem  is, the info Carson had is bad and there isn't any gold.  Carson wants to  leave no witnesses, Jim and Bob disagree and a shootout ensues, leaving Jim  with a whole lot to right.<br />Left for dead, Jim is befriended by a  legendary Indian killer.  They then run into some problems and Jim falls  across the shadows of Dead Thing, Wild Bill Hickok, Honest Roy and the  Battle of Little Big Horn.  Very descriptive scenarios by Lansdale are  portrayed , the dialogue is crisp and the motivations for all the  characters are realistic. None of us were at these events and don't know  the real story, but BLOOD DANCE rings true and is entertaining as  hell.<br />The book also contains some eighteen interior illustrations by Mark  A. Nelson.  They all tell a story themselves and truly illuminate the  printed word.  An all around great package...great story, great book design  and, most importantly of all, a novel that deserved to be read is  available.  Here's to the next lost volume!	2000-05-18

I don't understand buying books by an author knowing it is gonna be rich in historical background.  The readers who say it's bogged down apparently haven't read his other books...they are all like this. This one is great  becuse of the historical teachings of Roman, Druidism, Stonehenge and  Celtic myths and legends. To be able to tie that aincient history into what  is going on in the present is a talent most can't pull off...but Slade  does. It's got gore but more importantly the characters are real, the  situations are realistic and the conclusion reached, while not 100%  completed, makes sense. Slade's Special X series is one of the best out  there. I mean, you ever hear of the new science called geoprofiling?   I  hadn't but now will be looking to study up on it. If yu like serial killer  books with an intelligent twist, Slade is for you. I recommend reading all  the other Slade books first to understand, more fully, the history of the  Specail X division and its players.

I've waited 3 years for this epic novel to be released.<br />I was not  dissappointed!<br />Clegg delivers real characters, a situation that feels  like it could (or has) happened and a narrative voice totally unique.<br />The  best aspect was the way Clegg unfolds the story of a town destroyed 20  years ago and mixes it with the happenings of today.<br />Themes of  possession, Time...and that the past is never dead all come through crystal  clear.<br />The way Clegg uses different mediums to tell the story added to  the enjoyment of this book.  He uses taped interviews, written  notebooks/confessions, etc.<br />Also the way Clegg mixes what the characters  see...in htis time span and in the past/alternate realities...all mixed  into a strong plot line with a few twists that you don't see.<br />Was it  worth 3 years of anxiuos wait??<br />Hell yes!!	2000-03-30

BOB is about a man coming to terms with his wife's sudden  death...and trying to put the pieces together of her strange last few  months of life. Mike Noonan is a thriller-novelist, who's wife dies  unexpectedly.  He finds out a few things she did in her last months on  Earth and is perplexed.  Trying to solve these inconsistencies takes him to  his house in Maine called Sara Laughs.  What follows is a legal thriller, a  behind the scenes look at a novelist coming to terms with writer's block.  Mike comes across a young mother with her daughter, and it turns out she's  in a legal battle with his father-in-law for custody.  Turns out the  father-in-law is an original to this Maine town that has a lot of deep dark  secrets. These secrets unfold at a slow pace but is very enjoyable.  The  dialogue is colorful and seeing a few old King characters wander through  the novel is a pleasant experience. I have to say the gore is kept until  the last 50 pages or so and that I was shocked at who lived and died in  this one. A very enjoyable and satisfying novel, what did you expect, huh?

THM is a tale, broad in scope, that meditates on the duality of evil vs  good.  It's epic in it's attempt to pull together a myriad of characters,  histories of people and places and consequences. It is a tale of a town,  Stonehaven, and its mysteries.  It's a tale of Stony Crawford's life and  what happened to him at age 15 and what was let loose.  It's how he deals  with what he is and what he will, eventually, become.  It's about love.  It's about good and it's about evil. But above all, it is a great success.  Stonehaven, like most towns, has secrets.  But these are old secrets, even  ancient.  One man, Alan Fairclough, hunts out a myth...but finds it to be  true.  A weaver (or &quot;spinner&quot;)of tall tales, Nora Chance, tries  to tell Stony the truth about him and his heritage.  She also spins on  about The Halloween Man and his place in the world, past and present.  But  Stony is the main point of this novel.  His travels, his actions and his  ultimate honesty with himself and those like him. Sorry if this is vague,  but I don't want to ruin the joys, anguish and redemptive powers this novel  contains.  Douglas Clegg has raised the stakes: for himself,  as well as  for the genre he writes in. Recommended.	1998-09-22

TDP opens with  a 4 am phone call to Jon Kendrick from his grandmother.  She tells him she  found a body in her trash can.  Jon then goes home to Felicity Grove to  help solve the crime.  See, Jon and his grandmother are a tag team of  amateur sleuths who have solved a few of the crimes that have occurred in  the small town of Felicity Grove. Suffice to say, I read this one in one 3  hour sitting.  The characters are so flamboyant and unique that I enjoyed  finding out what happened next.  The dialogue pops and snaps so crisply, I  found myself yelling and/or laughing out loud.  And the plot is so full of  surprises and twists that I didn't figure out what was really going on  until the very end...and then I couldn't believe it. Highly Recommended.	1998-09-21

PORTRAIT is about, ultimately, 2 women dealing (in very different ways) w/  childhood sex abuse.  One becomes the psycho the title refers to; the other  is a feminist advice column writer.  But what both have in common will join  them together in infamy.<br />After she receives a &quot;fan letter&quot; and  gift from an admirer, Kathleen Shade is thrown into a hunt for a serial  killer.  Also investigating the case is officer Jeffrey Spence, a self  proclaimed &quot;solipsist and celibate gay&quot;.  These 2 opposites don't  exactly attract as magnify the tenseness in the story.  Eventually that  stress is turned into Spence using Shade as bait for the killer.<br />The  killer sews the mouths shut, punctures the ear drums, glues their eyes  closed and cuffs them to the a bed before torturing them in ways never  dreamed of...except by Lee &amp; Steffen, and you know how that  is...stomach churning.<br />Along the way we meet Sammy Shade, Kathleen's  uncle and molester, who just got paroled from jail.  After turning stool  pigeon on his mob bosses for a lesser term on trafficking child porn, he's  out and looking to get out of the country before Vinchetti, the mob boss  from Lee's novella &quot;The Pig&quot;, caps him.  Also thrown into the  insaneness is Maxwell Platt, a poet and Kathleen's love interest.<br />All of  these characters are well fleshed-out and the dialogue, specifically  between Kathleen and Spence, is hilarious and edged with sarcasm and bitter  wit.<br />Lee has written his best novel to date.  The moral questions his  characters raise, Sam Shade in particular, will have you challenging your  own rules of life.  This novel has important topics that question your  beliefs in many things.  Not to be forgotten, a late `90's classic horror  novel w/ much more going on then the sum of its parts.  It's as  thought-provoking as it is gut-wrenching. Most highest recommendation.	1998-08-23

We all know the themes THE CROW is about; Revenge and Justice.  The tricky  part is making thes interesting and fresh.  And Williamson delivers a  bomb!! Literally. It starts with some Militia blowing up a day-care center,  killing kids and a teacher.  The main character is the teacher and her  revenge and search for the justice due her.  So we follow her resurrection  and then her killing the one's responsible.  The best thing is the  teacher's evolving sense that she is not only killing the perpertrators but  also some &quot;innocent&quot; kids and women who get in the way.  Her  challenge to either go through or stop the carnage is interesting and  totally rewarding. A great read! Highest recommendation.	1998-08-23

It concerns the occult, surrogate motherhood and,  ultimately, loss and how the characters deal with it.  COME 13 is a story  about Todd who, after losing both parents, stays with a friend's family  only to run away and find out his true lineage.  That's it in a nutshell  but it is a lot more than that. Silva writes scenes in such a way that you  are lulled into the comfortable environment then BANG! a killer violent  scene explodes across the paper and the effect is devastating.  Anyone who  is not chilled or creeped out by the ending of the Part One is dead. With 4  books under his writing belt, this one person hopes to see more of David  Silva's novel-length work on the bookstore shelves.

And all I can say  about that is, if the second is as good as the first, keep them  coming!<br />The Searchers are a 3 people team doing &quot;shadow ops&quot;  for the American government, trying to investigate as many incidents of  paranormal occurrence as possible in the name of National Security.  While  on one of these journey's they come across a seemingly &quot;real&quot;  event.<br />The three &quot;searchers&quot; are Laika Harris, a black female  who is the leader and most middle of the road when it comes to believing in  the paranormal; Joseph Stein, the eldest and a desk rider for more years  than he was an active agent, and also the most non-believer in anything  pararormal; and lastly is Tony Luciano, an Itallian Roman Catholic who is a  believer.<br />These three debunk one case while investigating another one  that seems real.  This is followed by another dual event in which one is  proven false and the other appears true.  And both second cases are linked  they soon discover, which leads them on a chase across continents, history  and to the start of the world...or so it seems.<br />The best attribute of  this novel is that all three character's level of belief is challenged and  evolving so they are not cookie-cutter cardboard in rigidness.  They listen  to the others' opinions and choose what is real or unreal that way.  The  dialogue between the 3 is great, the action scenes unreal and the premise  unique and very interesting.<br />The only problem is with the ending...a  cliff-hanger that will be resolved, I hope, in book two titled, TRAIL OF  DUST.  All I can say is for the second in the series hurriedly arrive and  not be the last.  A great start to a unique series. Highest Recommendation.	1998-08-23

CONTROL FREAK is Christa Faust's debut as a novelist, having been a short story writer the past few years.  Faust definitely writes what she knows and lives.  Being a professional dominatrix has given this tale an air of authenticity others have tried but not pulled off as well.<br />CF opens up with a girl's murder.  During the investigation, it is found out that she worked in an S &amp; M bar. One detective, Mike Kiernan, and a girlfriend-type, Caitlin McCullough are the two main characters who do the job of finding out who killed the girl and why.  Each person's way of searching for the truth is as different as the lifestyles of each.  Caitlin goes on to become cxaught up in the S &amp; M scene and Mike searches the usual police procedural way.  Both find the answers, but some later than others.<br />This novel has a very seamy underbelly and is, ultimately, about the duality of humanity.  Caitlin's dominating demeanor versus her conscience of what's &quot;right and wrong&quot;.  Her development and fleshing-out as a character is pure genius and stays true to herself all the way through the book.<br />Faust's prose is clean, her dialogue moves the pace of the story and her realistic portrayals of the S &amp; M and B &amp; D lifestyles make the horrors that are unfolding almost unbearable to read about. A great debut and a worthy competitor with Caitlin Kiernan's SILK as best debut horror novel this year.  Buy and read this before everyone is talking about it.  Highest recommendation.	1998-08-23
US	52501264	R1LTQ0PTNJTFUW	0060179473	645468601	Galilee	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Not the sum of its parts.	GALILEE is an epic-long (582 pps) novel of a very broad scope, chronicling the lives of 2 families; one mythical the other secular.   The mythical family are the Barbarossas', whom reside in a magical house built by Thomas Jefferson.  The leader of this clan is Cessaria, the mother &quot;who had no parents&quot;, intimating that she has been here for a great long while, even before Christ.  Her son, Galilee was thrown out of the house and family for an idescretion that is not fully known until the last section of the book, but is the catalyst for this story. Galilee's story is intertwined with the family Geary, America's richest family (kind of like the Kennedy's).  Starting in the Civil War, both families were forever linked by sordid detail after sordid detail. And then comes Rachel, a &quot;common girl&quot; who is swept off her feet by Mitch Geary and they marry.  But after a few tragic incidents, their marriage is over and she's off to the island of Kauaii to visit &quot;The Geary womens' sanctuary&quot;, a house that is visited by Galilee when the women need servicing.  But this time, more than that happens and it puts into place the battle the two families have been inching towards for centuries. This is all told through the journal entry-type eyes of Eddie, a half-breed Barbarossa.  It's a very effective style that allows the reader to experience various points of view without losing the narrative's electric prose and action. I found the novels breadth to be vast and was more of a character study than a novel.  Clive masters the poetry of prose to stimulate feelings and emotions about many characters so you don't know who to root for or against.  The only problems I had with this work was that I felt a war was going to result with all of the layering Barker does through the first 400 pages.  But the climax is but a peep, resulting in a overly simplistic ending to the threat of the Geary's.  Also, Mr. Barker seems to have lost the need for explicitness, be itin describing one characters pred! ilection for bedding women who pretend to be dead or in scenes of ultra-violence.  He seems to have joined the group that believes the diatribe: less is more.  The novel is great, don't get me wrong.  It just could have been and should have been more than it is.

US	52501264	R2NY3NJUUJC9J8	0451456688	139111417	Silk	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Original and Engrossing Tale of a War in Heaven and on Earth	Rev'd by Paul J. Legerski<br />After reading a bunch of Caitlin's short fiction, it was with great anticipation upon opening her first published novel, SILK. I was not disappointed. SILK centers around a charismatic female leader named Spyder.  Her fledglings worship the ground she walks on because she has told them stories...stories about why they are all meant to be together.  It has to do with a war in heaven and the angels that were kicked out.  Spyder is then turned on by her friends and befriends another group of musicians and hangers-on.  The most stunning of these people, is Nikki Ky.  She is on a trip running away from her past and parents, not to mention a lovers suicide.  One of the most symbolic scenes is Nikki taking out her left nipple ring and wading into the ocean to &quot;cleanse&quot; her soul.  She almost drowns and is saved by a mysterious woman. Theirs also a rock band named Stiff Kitten that plays a large part in this book.  I must say that the first 200 or so pages may be the best I've read in 5 years.  The prose is crisp, the plots have an underbelly of the grotesque and the characters are so fleshed out that I felt the stinging of the saltwater ocean burning Nikki's piercing.  Not to mention that Caitlin can write so well that she makes coffee making interesting. The only problem I had with the novel was the ending.  The whole fabric of the plot is weaved into this story about the war in heaven but we never get to see or hear the entire story and its ramifications.  And what happens to Spyder didn't hold true for me. Sorry if I'm not giving any detail, but to tell more will spoil the book.  For those that need comparisons, mix Poppy Z. Brite's characters with an equal dose of Kathe Koja prose(without the punctuations).  But that does not do Caitlin's novel justice.  Highly original and just touching what she can do in a novel-length work.  More is highly anticipated. Highest recommendation.	1998-05-18

That is the biggest obstacle to the writers who accept this challenge.<br />Poppy Z. Brite meets and supersedes all of these problems and actually flourishes under the tight reins she was given as guidelines for using this licensed character.<br />Ms. Brite puts The Crow in her familiar, if alluring, New Orleans with Jared Poe, a photographer based a bit on Robert Mapplethorpe, an artist who is pushing the envelope of kinky.  At one of his shows, he meets Benjamin and his transsexual twin, Lucrece.  They make a fearsome threesome...until somebody murders one of them, another is found guilty of that murder and dies on Death Row and the other, with her guilt/grief, calls back the &quot;innocent&quot; Death Rower to reek revenge on all of those responsible.<br />The writing is poetic, the story captivating and Lucrece is Brite's first true &quot;female&quot; star (if you don't count Courtney Love) to evolve into a serious character.  No gore is spared when needed and Poppy has mastered the art of moving from present to past through flashback scenes that are so real, I actually had to stop reading at work for a while because NOTHING was getting done!<br />Ms. Brite has accomplished something only a few gifted writers can; using a limiting character and mythology that's been so overexposed it seems to cry out for monotony, and just kick its butt to make it your own unique and lasting own.<br />Most Highest Recommendation!

Tessier, for me, was such a writer...until now!  FOGHEART blends the lyrical prose and masterful plot twists Tessier is famous for,  into a book that slowly unfolds into sheer brilliance.<br />FOGHEART is a novel of wanting something you can't have, but willing to give up everything to try to capture and own it.  It's about three couples; Oliver and Carrie, Charley and Jan and Oona and Roz.<br />Oliver is a firm believer in only what he sees, plus he happens to enjoy serial murder.  Carrie, becomes a believer when she sees her father's ghost, naked and trying to tell her something about Oliver.<br />Charley is another disbeliever in the occult.  His wife, Jan carries the guilt of a dead daughter on her shoulders.  And a message from a seance Charley's friend attended puts them in touch with their past.<br />Oona is the medium who knows things nobody should know about these people.  Roz is her &quot;friend&quot; who protects Oona after her &quot;fits&quot;.<br />Oona spills the secrets of these 2 couples in scenes that Tessier describes magnificently.  You actually feel the pain and torment Oona goes through to get to &quot;the other side&quot;.  Once the story starts to unravel all of the knots Tessier throws in, the pages are a blur because you want to find out what happens next.  Tessier's mastery of using dialogue to move the plot is evident when Oliver hires an investigator to get into Oona's past.<br />The only problem with this work is the pace.  It creeps very slowly until about 2/3's of the way.  Then it's a fast read because all of the subplots merge together and it can be told through one character's eyes to speed it along.  It's worth the wait, believe me.  And the ending was one, I did not see coming but enjoyed since it fits into the layering Tessier put in the novel.<br />Recommended.	1998-05-18

While recovering, Jake meets Angel, a beautiful nurse whos uncle just happens to be on the verge of a successful new surgery to fix paralysis.  After the surgery Jake goes on a revenge mission to get who set him up.  In the process Jake falls in love with Angel, who is now being held hostage by the bad guy.  As you can tell by my synopsis, its kind of a paint-by-numbers scenario.  Everything is familiar and done by rote.  This is not to say that the book is unenjoyable.  Far from it.  It's full of action sequences but the main problem is there are no surprises...everything IS as it seems and we are just awaiting  the final shoot of so we can move on to the next book on the shelves.  Not a very distinguishing book.  Not recommended.	1998-02-02

That said, let's start.<br />BAD KARMA is Doug Clegg Lite.  It's primarily character-driven and paces like a shark cruising the bay for a human snack.<br /><br />It's a tale of Trey Campbell, a psychiatrist for the criminally insane.  It also &quot;stars&quot; Agnes Hatcher, the female Hanibal Lecter of the hospital.<br />Trey is on vacation when, during a very spooky and effective scene, Agnes escapes...and goes looking for Trey to right a wrong that Agnes believes was done to her over 100 years ago.<br />Follow me so far?<br />Trey is on a California island called Catalina with his family and Agnes comes out to spoil it...forever!<br />Anything else about the plot is pure spoiler.<br /><br />I liked this novel quite a bit...but if you LOVE Clegg, take this one with a grain of salt.  When I think of Clegg's novels like GOAT DANCE, NEVERLAND, THE CHILDREN'S HOUR and DARK OF THE EYE, I think about well-written deep characterizations, subplots above subplots and scenes of terror and, occasionally, eye grabbing gore.  Harper is into fast moving scenes, a character introduction that's brief enough so you can follow along and heart-stopping action.<br /><br />It may not be the most original novel ever written, but it's well written and fun.  It's a slim novel that will be able to be read in one or two sittings and well worth the time...until the new Clegg novel, THE HALLOWEEN MAN, hits stores in late `98.<br /><br />Recommended for Clegg fans and fans of high-paced non-thinking action.	1998-01-24
US	52501264	R2YBEJWOYH2MHB	0425161439	51963854	The Ten-Ounce Siesta	Books	5	8	8	N	N	This book is colorful and fun!	Norman Partridge returns with the sequel to Saguaro Riptide.  Jack Baddalach, the former light-heavyweight champ of the world, comes back this time to solve a who-dunnit that involves rattlesnakes, bikini girls with machine guns and a Chihuahua named Spike.  This novel also contains Satanists, tatooed donut shop owners and a whole host of very colorful characters.  The story revolves around who stole Spike, once it is given to Jack to transport across the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas.  To give any more away would be a spoiler.  Suffice to say that this book is a fast paced, rip and tear collage of memorable scenes and some of the most flamboyant characters in fiction to date.  The prose is lean and tight, with enough bite to keep the story flowing.  I enjoyed this because, unlike most sequels, the main character is starting to evolve.  Jack is beginning to understand why he does what he does and is okay with that.  Here's hoping that Partridge returns to this crazy shoot em up world of Jack Baddalach very soon.  But read the first novel, Saguaro Riptide, first so you get the full impact of the second.  Highly recommended.	1998-01-24
