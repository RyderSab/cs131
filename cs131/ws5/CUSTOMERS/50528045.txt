For example, during WW 2, Europe's Jews flocked to Nice trying to escape the Nazis and it wasn't long before the Nazis soon followed. This could have been fleshed out into something real - actually it could have been a book unto itself - but here it's given a scant 12 pages of exploration. By the end of the book, I felt like I just watched a parade go by. Kanigel is a wonderful writer, but this book is just too superficial to provide any real satisfaction.	2004-05-16

Since Warhol's death a condition known as Asperger's Syndrome has come to light. It's named after an Austrian doctor who discovered it in a group of his patients in 1940's. Due to the outbreak of WW2, his research papers remained untranslated, that is, until quite recently. In brief, Asperger's Syndrome can be seen as one of the less severe forms of Autism. Both conditions share many of the same manifestations; an individuals impairment of verbal/social skills, a sensitivity to sensory overload and a comfort found in repetitive actions. Many Aspies are visual problem solvers. Is it possible that Warhol was an Aspie? If this sounds interesting to you, try reading this book along with Elijah's Cup by Valerie Paradiz and see the strong parallels between the two.	2004-03-08

While this book is enormously entertaining, it's value is limited as a serious work of history. The reality is; Lord Duveen, grandson of a blacksmith from Delft, who went on to be an English Baron, was much more of a hustler than this 1950's era fantasy makes him out to be. For a more modern take on Lord Duveen try: Artful Partners: Bernard Berenson and Joseph Duveen by Colin Simpson.	2004-02-09

His big \\"insider\\" anecdotes are so dull and removed from the art world action of the last two decades that you almost feel sorry for him. But how can you feel sorry for anyone so idiotic that they would take the time to travel to the Jackson Pollock Foundation and sneak into the upstairs private toilet, so he could drop his pants and experience the sensation of sitting on Jackson Pollock's \\"personal\\" toilet?

My life was a mess, manifesting itself in my poor dietary habits. After limping home from the hospital, I scanned my bookshelves for something to read, as I convalesced. The Wisdom of No Escape sat on my bookshelf for a few years. Everytime I would see the title, I'd think, &quot;sounds depressing&quot;. Well, it's not. It is a very honest and straight forward guide book for the human creature. It basically tells you that life is hard and it's that hardness that makes it worth living. I also got the impression that the author believes that Heaven and Hell and reincarnation are all part of everyone's daily experience. Everytime something repeats itself in your life, you are experiencing a living reincarnation. The key seems to be in keeping it all new and fresh.	2003-04-17

It's often hilarious in it's outrageous, over the top, retelling of the heyday of Il Duce. But the glossing over of the realties of Fascism and Mussolini's pact with Hitler can get very sickening. In the end Signora Mussolini claims that \\"peace prevails in her heart\\", but somehow, in her narcissism, she has forgotten all the people that suffered besides Duce and her.	2002-10-15

The book is a quagmire of self-loathing and narcissism, it's the literary equivalent of being led through a maze by a blind person. Warhol's life story is one of hard work and dreams. This book is way too literal and never get's beyond the authors own personal neurosis to shed any light on one of the 20th century's most brilliant visual innovators.	2002-10-01

The result is this frothy, gossip ridden, whiskey sour. A 504 page, tall drink that doesn't get any sweeter as you suck it down. The anecdotes about Imelda Marcos, Truman Capote, Farah Diba make it seem like the 70's took place on another planet. It's a fun read and I laughed out loud quite a few times. But one get's the feeling that this book was written as revenge on Warhol for the social abuse that Colacello \\"suffered\\" during the years they worked together.	2002-09-25
US	50528045	RHEYIQR987VKB	0847819671	492385216	Unseen Warhol	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Touched by an Andy	The editorial review is misleading. This book is not a catalogue of &quot;unseen Warhol work&quot;. Many of the examples used are well known pieces. The unseen Warhol implied by the title, comes from the different sides of his personality that are revealed by the numerous people interviewed. Most everyone interviewed manages to reveal something about themselves as well as about Andy. Tama Janowitz tells the inside story of Andy's Blind Date Club and reveals the loneliness of being single. Maura Moynihan, the rebel punk girl, from Democratic royality, finds a father figure in Andy. Ronnie Cutrone, Andy's painting assistant for many years, explains what it was like to be there and participate in the creation of so many of Andy's masterpieces. Most everyone speaks with gratitude and appreciation on how much their lives have been enriched by their relationship with Warhol. But then there's Bob Colacello, obsessing about the &quot;wonders&quot; of Nancy Reagen and complaining how the original idea for the musical  Evita was stolen from him by Robert Stigwood. In the end, the praise and gratitude win and the bitterness is kept to a minimum in this well designed and enlightening book.	2002-09-09

In these extensive interviews, David Lynch tells of his journey from painting student to filmaker. He refuses to interpret his films, as he believes this strips them of their power. He reveals a lot of personal stuff like his fascination with piles of dirt and his obsession with building sheds out of found wood. Through his revelations you become acquainted with the motifs that drive him on. I especially enjoyed his explanations of his urban fears and how they transform themselves from city to city.	2002-08-28

These children are brainwashed and turned into slaves by the US Government. Cathy O'Brien claims that she was abducted into the CIA's MK Ultra mind control project, suffered years of torture and abuse and would have been killed if not for her rescue by Mark Phillips. Written in a lucid hallucinatory style, Trance is hard to put down. The names named and the crimes sighted are of a magnitude beyond anything you can imagine.

My favorite quote from this section is, &quot;By the time you're reading this, Buenos Aires could be in the grip of an economic crisis, or the good times might just be rolling again.&quot; Ahem. <BR>The hotel, museum, monument and restaurant information was useful and truthful.

Mick Rock was the supreme chronicler of the fantasy world of Glam. His images and Bowie's quotes are juxtaposed and further mythologize this highly original period. David Bowie states that he would be going to hell because he sold his soul to the devil. The book is arranged chronologically and ends with images of the Punk Rockers.

We went through the Time Out city guides (as they have been terrific for previous trips to Naples, Edinburgh and Venice)and Lisbon seemed like the perfect place for a 4 day trip out of New York City. We immediately got to work using this guide to pick the hotel and create a simple and groovy 4 day itinerary of museums, restaurants and sights. The guide was so easy to use, it has well detailed maps and all the described places are given clear map references. Unlike the case with many other guide's hotel reviews, the hotel we picked was exactly as they described it. <BR>The guide is also great if you enjoy exploring the newer and more modern parts of European cities (the Guggenheim isn't the only modern architecture worth seeing on the Iberian Penninsuala). We visited the former site of the Expo 98 and it was fascinating and exciting with many examples of world class architecture.<BR>The gay and lesbian section was also very accurate and insightful.<BR>I think these city guides suit openminded and adventurous travellers who are willing to visit places in a slightly left of center way and mix with all different types of people.	2002-01-06

The author deals with Crane's homosexuality as an integral part of his art (as it should be) which apparently has not been the case up until now. My only complaint is that there is too much made up dialogue between Crane and his friends. After awhile you begin to feel you have entered the land of fiction instead of biography. The author presents Crane's horrible relationship with his tyrannical father as the cause of much of his short life's misery.	2002-01-04

A great revision of The Wizard of Oz that opens one's eyes to the good inside what is sometimes first seen as evil.
