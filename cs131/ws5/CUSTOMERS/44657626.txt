L. B. Matekoni and continues to work her short detective problems in this charming second addition to the Number One Ladies Detective Agency series.  Tales of joy and triumph over suffering abound throughout this book.  I do highly recommend the reader enjoy the original Number One Ladies' book before this one, since it gives an excellent introduction to the characters and many references are made in this book to events in the first one.  I must warn you though, once you read one book in this series you will be hooked!	2005-10-08

Set in Botswana, the story opens with background on the life of our heroine leading up to how she became a private detective.  The book is filled with humerous short stories in each chapter, usually involving the solution to a brief mystery in which our detective uses clever skills.  The scenery is richly described, and makes the stories endear to the heart.  And there is some love linked into the overall story, which I am sure any reader will enjoy.  I wish I could give this a 6th star!	2005-10-03

So much of what I have experienced in life is explained so well with the simple concepts that Gary Chapman presents in this easy to read manual on human relationships.  Often relationships suffer when both parties are trying in ways they think are best, but leading to unintended hurt feelings.  This book helps you sort out good issues to think about.  I found it challenging to sit back and think about myself and which love languages I respond to the most.  Although the book offers suggestions on exercises to discover one's own love language, I found it difficult to prioritize them.  Some of the suggestions led to conflicting results in my own self assessment.  Nevertheless, this book offers insight unlike any other relationship book I have seen.	2005-09-21

Nonsensical happenings occur also, with bad actors, slot machine jackpots, crazy overaged cheerleaders, etc.  Although this isn't a mystery in the usual sense, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Unlike TBS, this book wasn't too hard to follow, yet the connections between the characters were intriguing, and the insights that Marlowe drew were very good.  The action is fast paced and Marlowe carries all the charm of Humphrey Bogart sweating under a porkpie hat chasing down all the leads in his vintage Chrysler.  The sequences of Marlowe jousting with the police are priceless.  And the shocking conclusion hit me hard, yet made perfect sense.   <br /> <br />I loved every minute of reading this thriller!	2005-04-18

Huh? <br /> <br />Getting past that, the story is good in parts, such as the flight to Reno and LA, but boring in parts too.  And the ending wrapped up a little too neatly at the end, like the author suddenly threw together a hokey explanation to finish the story in the last two pages.  Kinsey's love life and her friendship with Henry are consistent with the entire alphabet series.  Quaint references to pre-home computer days enter this 1987 based story.  Overall, I found this to be a subpar Millhone story.	2005-04-05

The future world involves a backwards world where firemen start fires to rid the world of books, because that is in the best interest of good social order.  But our hero is a fireman who develops a conscience, after meeting a spunky 17 year old who has dreams and challenges our man that the world may have been different in the past.   <br /> <br />The tension between our hero and his fire captain boss, as well as the tension with his mindless wife, are excellent.  The whole story is an eye opener, full of compelling action and riviting philosophical discussion.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed the notes from Mr Bradbury in the 50th anniversary edition where he admits he subconsciously gave our protagonist the name of a paper company, and the name of his professor friend from a pencil company.   <br /> <br />This is a classic that will endure for centuries, despite whatever firemen exist in the future.	2005-03-18

It reads very fast, includes well developed characters, and has that hard edge to it that keeps the reader rivited to the action.  Our main character is a grifter who is always looking for the next town, the next con and the next woman to bed.  He goes to Atlantic City and needs some luggage, and lo in behold, the bags he happens to steal include some illegal contraband.  Then a woman enters the picture and our protaganist starts to see some odd coincidences.  Will he kill for her?  I was fascinated to read the outcome of this easy to read book, and try to outguess where Mr Block was leading us.  The ending did surprise me a little. <br /> <br />Considering this book was written in 1961, the sex and drug descriptions must have been pretty racy for the times.	2005-03-04

Like all the Burglar series, this book is full of fast action and snappy banter between our hero, Bernie, and his friend Carolyn.  In a city of 8 million, the coincidences of people bumping into each other begins to appear to be absurd, but grabs the reader's interest.  And Bernie helps out our bumbling cop, Ray, by \\"pulling a rabbit out of his hat\\" again in a dramatic showdown, assembling a room full of suspects and interested parties for a complicated explanation that draws out the guilty to expose themselves.	2005-02-11

Dr Johnson breaks his thoughts into three major sections.  The first deals with the existance of God and issues involving science and creation, etc.  Dr Johnson carefully weaves through a lot of discussion on both sides of the fence, so to speak, and does so with an honesty that comes off as genuine.  The middle section deals with the character of God and related discussions about the Christian believed son of God, Jesus Christ.  Here is where Dr Johnson really poured out his heart over the significant themes in the four gospels of the New Testament, and talked a lot about how his interpretations sometimes differ from organized religion.  The final section goes into a discussion of how your belief system should shape your life.  Here is where Dr Johnson deeply examines his own life, and almost expresses regret over not using his time, talents and wealth more perfectly (I felt like he should forgive himself a little in that regard). <br /> <br />Dr Johnson warns the reader early on that he feared the book would offend both the left wing (for being too pro-God and Jesus) and offend the right wing (for challenging some organized religious views).  He may be right, but I found his views honest, refreshing and interesting to consider.	2005-01-27

With sidekick police detective Marino protecting her, will she survive?  And what about old boyfriend Mark James?  Can she trust him?  The suspense is very good at times.

At the core of the evil empire is a Red Mafiya figure known as \\"the wolf\\", who's the baddest man on the planet.  Will Alex survive the personal dangers involved with stalking the wolf?

For example, at one point we meet a 14 year old computer hacking genius, who upon first meeting our hero, rudely replies to a nice question with a profane remark -- seemed out of character to me.  Be warned - Patterson doesn't tie up all the loose ends at the end of this book, as I'm sure he anticipates some elements of this story to flow into future Alex Cross books.	2004-12-31

Kudos to Ms Feldon for bravely opening up her feelings of loneliness and the difficulties of adjusting to living alone.

Sounds preposterous, doesn't it?  As you read Pi's adventure, you often wonder what is real and what is hallucination due to lack of food and drinking water.  Undoubtedly, others found his tale too hard to believe as well, so he told a second story.  But which is harder to believe, and which story do you want to believe?  Those are the questions the author wants you to ponder as you rejoice in Pi's struggle to survive so he can worship God another day.   <br /> <br />Many reviews criticized the front portion of the book, dealing with Pi's years of growing up in Pondicherry, India, his experience in the zoo and his multiple religious faiths.  Indeed, his multiple faiths could be argued to be conflicting.  But I found this to be interesting, in shaping the character of the boy who could overcome tremendous odds to survive. <br /> <br />Count this book as one that will be considered classic literature some day.	2004-11-28

In particular, Sunny's relationship with Richie is very unusual, but I will say it is interesting.  This is a very good book, and once again, Parker writes in a crisp style that holds your attention.	2004-10-16

Five divers/scientists go deep into the Atlantic Ocean, and become abducted by another species of humans who live in a large air-filled cavity under the seas.  The \\"aliens\\" are a happy people who abhor violence, and who transfer their souls from body to body to live forever.  The \\"aliens\\" also have advanced technology which is difficult to explain (for example, why do they use lights to set up artificial days and nights?).  Our ordinary human heroes want to escape.  The ending is particularly ridiculous, and comes across as Dr Cook ran out of time to think of how to wrap up this crazy story.	2004-09-25

In other words, it gets a little too silly at times.  But the story is interesting, involving a rich young man from Switzerland who may or may not be who he claims to be.  Another young man ends up dead in a swimming pool at a party, starting the mystery.  At one point, McNally is working for three clients at the same time, which I thought would develop into more conflicts of interest than it did (seemed like a lost opportunity for the author).  The drama of the second pool party was one of the best parts of the book.  Especially when McNally started to count toes.	2004-09-20

This thriller is more of a science fiction alien invasion story than a medical thriller, involving a worldwide takeover from outer space.  The aliens are out to change mankind, perhaps for the better (?).  But nevertheless, the human instinct is to resist the invasion -- that is, those few remaining uninfected humans.  Are there enough left to save humanity?  Comparing this book with other outer space takeover attempts (Michael Crichton's Prey comes to mind), I would say this one is a winner.  I found it captivating, easy to read, and a page turner I couldn't put down.	2004-09-14

For one thing, nobody drops dead until well after halfway into the story, and, there is not a lot of interest on any of the parties in discovering the murderer, until the end.  I was not particularly satisfied with that.  The focus for most of the book is on a psychic, who is suspected of being a charlaton.  McNally is trying to discover how he gets his psychic powers.  Once discovered, I felt the story went out with a bit of a whimper.  As usual, though, the lighthearted style of the McNally series is entertaining.	2004-06-04

Although I have fond memories of Lawrence Sanders' writing style, I don't understand the criticism for Vincent Lardo's continuation of this excellent series.  This book is outstanding.  The plot twists are intriguing and clever.  I was mesmerized by the intertwined stories of Melva and Fairhurst, as Archie discovered more and more connections between the death of the dispicable Geoff Williams, and the blackmail of Fairhurst the III.  The romantic dilemma for Archy was also an interesting side story.  In my mind, this book had it all.  Archy was in top form, jousting with the pater and his beloved Connie, dealing with the inept Binky on occasion (not too much, thankfully), and enjoying several medium rare steak tartares at the Pelican Club.	2004-05-21

Although this is a book about dealing with failed adult relationships, the main emphasis in on the phenomena of co-dependency.  Unresolved issues of childhood are the primary cause, and Drs Hemfelt, Minnerth and Meier go through many real life case studies that lead the reader to examine their own life, as well as the life of thier &quot;significant other&quot;.  Realizing how your lowly filled &quot;love tank&quot; is affecting your life is a powerful tool for recovery.  Realizing you have a loving heavenly father is a key to recovery as well.

I am a conservative, and I agree with many of Bill O'Reilly's opinions, but he comes across as overly arrogant in his &quot;I know what's best for you&quot; attitude.

Lots of political intrigue mixed with life threatening adventure.  The heroine is torn between loyalty to her father, and what she thinks is moral and just.  The president comes off as sometimes a good guy, sometimes a bad guy - you have to wait to the end to find out the truth (which is nice).  Dan Brown did an excellent job of creating a most unusual story with just enough scientific background to lend it enough credibility to make it a fun read.  I loved how after the car was bombed, the reader had to wait several chapters to find out who was killed.  The suspense was killing me.<br />Overall, I found this book more enjoyable than The DaVinci Code.  So if you are like me and like Clive Cussler's books, you must try this one out.	2004-01-14

Can Jack trust the other workers at the plant?  Can Jack save his family?  You sort of know the end from Crichton's introduction, but you don't really know it, which makes for a very interesting book.  The last day stretches out and you feel like you are reading the dramatic events in the time it took for them to occur.  <br />This book is an easy read, but filled with unnecessary profanity.

Inside, Dr Clarke gives hard hitting advice for dealing with an adulterous spouse, based on the tough love approach probably first advocated by Dr James Dobson.  I found Dr Clarke's book more direct in its advice than Dobson's however.  Clarke makes the victim realize that they have nothing to feel bad about, which if all that's one is to get out of the book, isn't a bad thing.  Clarke hammers home again and again that nothing one spouse does to the other justifies the adulterer from the sinful action of adultery.  Preach it, Dr Clarke.  <br />I suspect the people that take Dr Clarke's advice are not very likely to win their spouses back - but then they aren't likely no matter what strategy they follow.  So why not?  Take Dr Clarke's advice and start picking up the pieces and feel better about yourself.  Don't let your adultering spouse attempt to transfer their guilt onto you.  Take charge!

This book has those traits, but for the most part is fairly entertaining.  Michael Brock has a life transforming experience when he is nearly killed in a hostage situation.  He reassesses his greed, and turns into a bleeding heart liberal, fighting for the homeless people of Washington DC.  He chucks his six figure salary and his doctor wife for an austere life in Northeast DC, where crime is rampant, and drug addicts abound.<br />The subplot on Michael's marriage was a little too simplistic and shallow for my taste.  It was a little hard to believe that both parties found new love interests so quickly, with so little remorse.  The main plot also wrapped itself up into too neat of a bow as well.  I guess Grisham wanted a happy ending, but in real life, I doubt it would come out so well.	2003-10-21

A member of the witness protection program is relocated to Arizona, only to be found by thugs from her former life, and murdered.  Beaumont travels from Seattle to help Sheriff Brady solve the murder, and further crimes.  The story was very interesting, but I didn't like the way Joanna fell a victim to temptation near the end of the book.  This was out of character for her.

Each chapter is unique, and gives homework for the person to work through topics like anger, loneliness, grieving, etc.  I found the chapter on dumper/dumpee relationships (grief vs. guilt) and the chapter on love to be the most valuable.  Fisher describes many types of love, and allows a confused person to sort out where they and their spouse actually stood with each other, both during and after a marriage.  Unravelling confusion is important to anybody going through a divorce.  I cannot more strongly recommend this book to anybody who has been dumped by their spouse.  Buy it, keep it, and go back to it many times over the months you may be trying to &quot;climb your mountain&quot;.	2003-09-29

Most people are not in that situation, however.  In almost 80% of all divorces, one party is dumping the other, and the dumpee is the one seeking guidance from books like this - but this book doesn't help the typical dumpee.  <br />About the only thing I thought was worth understanding from this book is that the best way of &quot;getting even&quot; is living well.

In his tough love approach, he outlines the way someone should deal with a spouse who has cheated on them.  Although the temptation will be there to try to win back the person with affection, Dobson illustrates this is 180 degrees away from the best approach - very counter-intuitive to most folks.  However, Dobson gives no guarantees, as even the &quot;best approach&quot; may be destined to failure.  <br />I highly encourage anybody going through marital crisis to read this book, but not share it with your spouse.	2003-09-29

I found the first half of the book to be very depressing.  In addition, unless you are a scholar of ancient Greek literature, it may be difficult to understand all of the analogies Bridges is trying to draw.  And the topics are just plain deep.  Bridges outlines three phases of any of life's transitions: an ending, a period of confusion, and a new beginning.  Bridges seems to want people to acknowledge their endings, and offers some good advice for handling the middle period (although I doubt many people would sit down and write their autobiographies).  If you are going through a transition, and trying to make sense of why it is occuring to you (what caused the ending?), I don't think this book will help much. This book is more for people who are focusing forward, not backward.	2003-09-29

But this one was a bit too complicated to enjoy.  When I read a Rhodenbarr book, I don't want to have to think too hard, but this one has too many twists and too many paintings to keep track of.  The story starts out nice enough, with a kidnapped cat and a ransom call (in a Nazi voice) requesting a Mondrian painting.  Unfortunately, the catnapping story loses steam and after awhile, I think Lawrence Block almost forgot it, then suddenly tried to wrap a bow around it.  Bernie reveals the twisted details in the end, but he doesn't sufficiently explain how he solves the mystery.  He rounds up the suspects into one room for the showdown, and the suspect list includes characters heretofore unseen.  I wish all the suspects could have been introduced to the reader before hand, so we had a fighting chance to figure out the mystery ourselves.	2003-07-14

What I did notice, however, was a lengthy story that plodded along at a much slower pace than most of the alphabet books.  Kinsey did express some disgust with Hungarian cooking, for the first time.  <br />I'm sorry, but I couldn't get very excited about a couple of old retired cops re-opening an 18 year old murder case.  I used to enjoy the antagonism between Kinsey and Con Dolan, but in this book, it was if they were lifelong best friends.  There was little tension in the entire book until the very end, which went out with a bit of a wimper.  <br />As a side note, I sensed as I was reading the book that Ms Grafton may be tiring of writing the series, and this may be her last book.

Set in an upstate New York bed and breakfast, and trapped by a snowstorm, an eccentric set of guests start noticing bodies dropping like flies.  Was it Professor Plum in the conservatory with a candlestick?  Perhaps Mrs Peacock?  Bernie wants to solve the murders, but also is interested in pilfering an autographed copy of Raymond Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep\\".  I was able to guess the killer fairly early, but was highly entertained by the quirky guests, including the pompous British Colonel, and 10 year old Millicent.  A couple of things were left unexplained at the end, however, including one of the deaths (natural causes?).  Furthermore, Millicent saw something that she reported to Bernie, but nothing ever became of it.  I wanted all the loose ends tied up.  I know, Chandler wouldn't have tied them, but this wasn't a hardboiled detective story.  I also expected more out of Bernie's fake death trick.

I found very little humor in it -- not to say that is bad, though.  I classify this book as a thriller, a very unusual thriller.  The tension builds as we head off toward a Civil War battle re-enactment, waiting to see who will use real bullets instead of blanks in their rifles.  Our hero, a daredevil diver, befriends some Detroit gangsters who are vacationing in rural Mississippi.  Now why would these folks want to come to Dixie?  To supplant the Dixie Mafia's drug business, of course.  The book starts out a little strange, as our hero witnesses a murder.  The murderer knows he's a witness, yet lets him go (why?).  Several times in the book, it looks like we're heading to a deadly confrontation, but the antagonists decide to put things off and settle later at the battlefield.  You won't find many virtuous characters in this dark thriller, but you will be entertained.	2003-02-11

The hero finds a good sum of unexplained money, and knows that somebody is onto him.  It gets very exciting near the end, as he feels the noose tighten around his neck, but then, Mr Grisham lets us down in the last chapter.  The book ends in a very unspectacular whimper.  Left unexplained were several events, such as: Why the arson events? Why the threat to the IRS? Why didn't the bad guy just steal the money in the first place?  Why didn't the bad guy know where the money was, given the extreme surveillance our hero was under (e.g., the photos of his secret storage sites)?  Some ... no, correct that... most of the actions done by the bad guy didn't seem to be in his best interest.	2003-01-26

Kudos to Lawrence Block for creating a witty series in the burglar mysteries, and a special kudo for this entry -- the best of the bunch (so far).  The characters are appealing, the dialog is pithy, and the plot is intriguing.  As usual, burglary is mixed in with murder, and our hero must find the killer to clear his own name.  I loved the way Bernie confronts the suspects in the dramatic scene in the apartment.  Such an intellect hasn't seen the pages of fiction since Nero Wolfe.  I highly recommend this well written book.  I suspect Mr Block would make for a most interesting dinner party.	2003-01-23

This book features two intertwined stories - each competing to see which could be the most preposterous.  First, we have the silly tale of a sub-culture of modern \\"vampires\\", who are killing at an alarming rate, sometimes with the help of a tiger that only they can command.  This story alone made this a pretty sick book.  Finally, Patterson attempts to bring some closure to some of the earlier Alex Cross books by disposing of the \\"Mastermind\\", who really killed many of the victims wrongly attributed to other mass murderers in the previous books.  The identity of the \\"Mastermind\\" was very dissappointing, and even laughable.  Forgive me, but I couldn't take this book seriously.  Please Mr Patterson, do not tarnish your reputation by continuing to pump out unimaginative trash.	2003-01-12

Steve Allen and his real life wife must solve the mystery before they become victims as well.  The book was very enjoyable, yet unbelievable.  First off, I find it impossible to believe the LAPD wouldn't latch onto the accidents with suspicion sooner.  Second, I could not believe the killer, who was so careful throughout the story would betray their identity in the final dramatic scene.  Finally, Steve and Jayne's escape from death was a bit too difficult to swallow, especially with such a shallow explanation offered after the fact.  Nevertheless, Mr Allen writes murder mysteries in the style of an old fashioned gentleman, which makes them a joy to read.  Whatever happened to wit and manners?	2003-01-05

I figured the murders out about halfway into the book, but that did not diminish my joy in reading how the protagonist would survive this nightmare.  In a nutshell, our hero also knows who the bad guy is, but is helpless to do anything about it.

That came across in about half of the book.  Unfortunately, Mr Vise didn't have enough material to write a book of reasonable length, so he improvised with a lot of uninteresting material on the life of FBI director Louis Freeh, and way too much rehash of the Aldrich Ames and Timothy McVeigh stories.  Although a lot of interesting details emerged on Hanssen, I still don't understand the man.  Several aspects of his life appear to contradict each other, and the psychiatrist explanations left me unfulfilled.

The feeling of reading this book reminded me of the feel of a comfortable set of old shoes.  The characters are very appealing, and I can't wait for the next entry to see them mature and progress, and solve crimes along the way.

Too many clues lead Marilee to think it wasn't an accident, so she decides to stay and find the truth.  She develops a love/hate relationship with a cowboy, who struggles to maintain the purity of the land in the midst of the Hollywood crowd.  The rich villain maintains a cast of high power friends and a wacko cousin who immediately gives everybody the creeps.  It wasn't too hard to discriminate the good guys from the bad guys.  What disappointed me, was the concentration of the romance story at the end, rather than wrapping up the loose ends of the mystery.  I never understood the fate of the lawyer.  <br />Ms Hoag's writing style is excellent if you like to put a book down for a few days and pick it up later.

I probably would have enjoyed it more had it been my first \\"burglar\\" book, but I was spoiled by the excellent \\"Ted Williams\\" edition.

The killer is playing games with her, singling her out by slipping her trophies from the dead girls found in the swamp.  <br />This book is rich with descriptions of the Louisiana scenary, the Cajun people, and many interesting suspects.  Ms Hoag goes to great lengths to build the story with gripping background material on a number of shady characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed trying out my own theories as to which one could have the motive and opportunity to commit the murders.  Near the end, the killer reveals him/herself to our heroine in a cutesy fashion, further adding to the drama.  Read it.  You'll love it.	2002-05-04

Only in the last couple of pages does Archie figure out how Wolfe was figuring out the mystery all along.  There were a lot of details to attempt to follow, and they weren't interesting enough for me to care.  As usual, the dialog between Wolfe and Goodwin is the high point of the book, but I want Archie to be more involved in the solution.	2002-04-17

Our confused teenager is trying to escape the responsibilities of modern society, and proving he is vulnerable along the way.  Ironically, he sees himself as above the average man (or &quot;phony&quot;, as Holden reiterates).  I read this over two days - about the length of time of the story itself.  I had trouble putting the book down, as Holden spiraled out of control, I kept wondering how it would end.  Fortunately, he had two saviors - his younger siblings -  one of which only being a fond memory.  I am convinced his destiny was saved only when he woke up to the terrible life turn to which he was inspiring his sister.  This is not a cheery book, but it is real drama, certainly not &quot;phony&quot;.	2002-04-01

I love the snappy banter between Wolfe and Goodwin, and Wolfe's eccentricities.  Goodwin enjoys jabbing at his boss at every turn, and I can just picture the fat, lazy genius who refuses to get out of his chair when a lady comes to his presence.  Wolfe scores a zinger early as he figures out the method with which Barstow is killed.  The latter part of the book was dissappointing.  We figure out the killer way too early, and the &quot;suspense&quot; ends up trying to figure out Wolfe's plan for the finale.  Once we got there, I was stunned - surely Wolfe could have planned something better than that!  Yes, the killer pays, but I expected Wolfe to come up with a cleaner way of disposing of the case.	2002-03-30

The pages fly by as Kidd and LuEllen banter back and forth, battling the evil US government and evil US government contractors.  It takes about 290 pages to discover why the bad guys are willing to kill in order to prevent the public from finding out what they are doing.  As an engineer, I found some of the technical details humorous.  Sandford (Camp) certainly tried to make it plausible, but I don't think so.  One thing I didn't like was the lighthearted treatment of our heroes' moral behavior.  And the connection of internet friends that help them is beyond belief as well.  All in all, the book is entertaining, but not suspenseful, and a little hollow.	2002-03-23

I found the action entertaining, yet difficult to tie together.  Only at the very end do we get the benefit of Marlowe's revelation.  Even so, one of the deaths was never addressed.  Between bodies falling, this book features more shady characters than even Los Angeles could have supported.  Most of them die, of course.  With the exception of the General, only Marlowe seems to have a clear conscience in this saga into the gutter of morality.  I did enjoy Chandler's use of language in characterizing so much of the story with subtlety.  It is hard to believe Marlowe would risk so much because of his duty to his client.	2002-03-17

The first half of this novel is very slow, but once you slug through it, you will enjoy the action packed second half.  Terry McCaleb is the main character, brought out of retirement by Jaye Winston to profile a sick killer, who hogtied his/her victim and left an owl behind as a clue.  We have little sympathy for the victim, who may have been a killer himself, but McCaleb must solve the case before somebody else ends up hogtied.  The action gets intertwined with a courtroom drama involving old buddy, Harry Bosch.  Meanwhile, McCaleb's new wife isn't enjoying involvement in this mess.  McCaleb keeps sniffing and he keeps finding clues pointing toward Harry.  Say it ain't so, Harry.	2002-03-11

The story focuses on Hawk, in a battle against gang bangers on Hobart street.  Spenser and Hawk solve a murder after the police failed to put enough resources onto the problem.  Hawk's character flaws surface, as Spenser and Susan mull over his future potential.  I found it sad and pathetic to think of Hawk as merely a gang banger gone legitimate.  Parker alternates chapters between the gloom of the ghetto and scenes with Spenser and Susan sipping champagne.  This contrast in day/night lifestyle for our hero was getting a bit boring after a couple of dozen chapters.  Overall, this book had very little action, not much mystery, and left me without much of a good feeling.  It appeared Parker was just going through the motions of writing another Spenser formula book.	2002-03-04

Goodwin are challenged into identifying American communists, and the apparent murderer of one.  Archie's snide comments about his lazy boss are the most amusing part of the story.  The writing style is much more mature than most modern mysteries, but many details in the story (e.g., Mr X) were never addressed in the resolution.  Be warned, you will be surprised.  I enjoyed the technique of bringing all the suspects together for the final confrontation scene.	2002-03-04

The historical prologue didn't fit as well as in most Pitt novels, but the adventures in the race to stop the bad guys was outstanding.  The end is a real kicker -- I could hear the theme to \\"Love Story\\" in my head as I was reading it.  Hmm?  I wonder if Kelly will re-appear with a tall, dark, handsome man, as Dirk predicted?  I had one dissappointment with the historical stories.  I didn't pick up on the motivation for the sinking of the Kearsage.  I guess Cussler forgot to wrap that part of the story into the end.	2002-02-25

John D. MacDonald knows how to keep the action flowing, without hitting the reader over the head.  It's nice to be treated as if you are an intelligent reader, which is why I keep coming back to the McGee series.  Travis helps out a man whose father was killed, shortly before cancer would have taken him anyway.  As Travis pokes around, he finds a web of dispicable characters hiding behind the entertainment industry.  Justice is served to the guilty, as usual.  Unfortunately, some of the innocent do not come out of this one, but only those who are not as careful as our houseboat hero.  This is definitely one of the better entries in the McGee series, but one should read &quot;A Quick Red Fox&quot; first.	2002-02-15

It is scary, to say the least.  The action was gripping.  I was hooked as soon as Belden had his trip to visit the grand jury.  From there on, it was non stop thrills.  I think Hollywood will latch onto this story.  How does a lawyer like Martini learn so many details about nuclear weapons?  I only hope some of the technical details were fiction.	2002-02-11

This one got too silly for me.  Ms Evanovich got caught up in the laughs so much, she forgot to put in the mystery.  If you are depressed, you might enjoy this.  It's fast and entertaining.  I figured out the firebomber way too early.  At the end, I didn't even care much about the person Stephanie was pursuing.  I did like the way Steph's friends and family harassed her about the &quot;glow&quot; in her face.	2002-01-26

Oh how I was looking forward to the explanation behind all those sub-plots involving Dr Purcell's wives, family members and co-workers. Oh how dissappointed I was when Kinsey failed to find the bullet the first place she suspected.  Oh how dissappointed I was when I was offered a weak explanation behind the killer's motive at the end.  This book desparately needed an epilogue.  The best part of the book was the second story line with Kinsey's new landlords, obviously patterned off the Menendez brothers.  I knew everybody wasn't who they seemed to be, and I was pleased with the outcome of that part of the book.  However, the main story left a huge hole in my imagination.  Too many loose ends were hanging with not even an attempt of an explanation. For example, why all the hubbub from Fiona about Kinsey getting permission to talk to her daughter?  Were all of Dow's business partners guilty of medicare fraud, or just one of them?  How and why did Leila steal the money?  These stories were building to what I thought was going to be a spectacular conclusion.  I sense some frustration from Ms Grafton in the story, sense she didn't attempt the standard Millhone epilogue.  I guess she cornered herself into such a tight box, there was no credible epilogue to attach the the mess.	2002-01-21

The writing style is simpler and faster to read than Grafton's, and the mystery was not too terribly hard to solve, given the abundance of bad characters (all of which being guilty of something).  I was expecting McCone's houseguest to be the scapegoat, which never really happened.  The interplay between McCone and the police was not very realistic.  All in all, it was a fun read, but not extremely exciting.  The story had the potential to be much more interesting.	2002-01-18

This book displays the evil imagination of James Patterson at its fullest.  I found far too much of it annoying in that it was difficult to tell what was real vs. what was only imagined by the characters.  The ending was no surprise to me, although Mr Patterson certainly intended it to be.  I also found the character flaws of the eventual virgin to be unfitting with the story line.  This one is not for the faint of heart, and I'm sure many Roman Catholics are offended by it.	2002-01-05

As Dr Scarpetta quickly discovers, though, what's really happening with the latest event is a copycat version of the past nine crimes.  Why is a copycat?  To hide what the killer was really doing.  You'll be amused by the timely plotline, with the medical details that appear authentic and chilling.  The exposure of the real killer at the end was a surprise, but I was not impressed with the killer's motive.  Overall, this book reads better than most Cornwell books, and the pages fly by.	2002-01-01

Meanwhile, mysterious strangers threaten her to leave poor Mo alone.  She might, except dead bodies keep popping up, piquing her curiosity.

Sheriff Brady must find a serial killer who scalps the victims as part of his/her trademark.  Could the killer be part of the new Apache dude ranch?

This mixture of science fiction and horror is really a psychodrama, set 1000 feet below the ocean surface.  A team of intrepid scientists is assembled by the US Navy to explore an alien spaceship found in the Pacific.  Although we don't entirely solve the riddle about where the ship came from, we do find an incredible sphere inside it, which changes the lives of the scientists.  Who can you trust?  What is real and what is only imagined?  What is reality?  These are all questions thrust at our protagonist, an overweight psychologist struggling to keep pace with the other intellectual giants.  This book should be made into a movie - not the one with Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone - but one faithful to the text.  It keeps the reader's attention.  Michael Crichton deserves kudos for doing his homework on it, as well.  His scientific descriptions are believable, for the most part.	2001-12-08

Soon, we discover Susan psychoanalyzing herself, with Spenser playing the role of insightful facilitator.  This isn't what Spenser fans want.  We want hard edged Spenser/Hawk action.  There is a good bit of action, and I love the banter between Spenser and Hawk.  I especially like Hawk slipping into his upper middle class WASP accent.  The story lacked something in the end, however.  I came away a bit unsatisfied, even though Susan whacked one of the bad guys with a brick.  Too bad the tongue was cut without the right folks understanding the reason.	2001-11-29

It starts off with an interesting murder, then drags on for a long time.  Meanwhile, we slug along through seemingly unconnected events, until finally things begin to focus.  I wanted it all to build to a great climax, but it best scene (Joanna vs. the killer) occurred too early, leaving Ms Jance a few more chapters to tie up the other loose ends, such as the missing husband and Junior.  There was a lot of good story within this book.  Perhaps if it was packaged better, it could be a solid 4 or 5 star mystery, but it has a bit too much soap opera within it.  Like all Brady books, it was a pleasant and fast read, however.  After reading several of them, though, I still can't figure out the source of antagonism between Joanna and Eleanor.	2001-11-24

Some of the &quot;good guys&quot; turn out bad, and some of the &quot;bad guys&quot; turn out good.  For the second time, Sue Grafton takes us back to Louisville, as Kinsey attempts to discover why so many people have Kentucky and Vietnam in common.  Another common thread is the old gang at that favorite watering hole in Colgate.  Like all of the best alphabet stories, this one ends with a bang, in which Kinsey must deal with imminent death as she uncovers the killer.

As usual, I started with the editor's synopsis inside the jacket, but in this one, the editor must not have read the book.  No, the parents are not clamoring for Sheriff Brady to arrest the football star.  The book is pleasant enough, and fast reading, but it is incredible that most of the subplots eventually tie together.  That's too much of a coincidence for me.

This unusual story starts with a Greek theater director, who thinks he's being stalked.  Then it takes off with murder, illegal immigration, and some whacky women.  Spenser needs more help than Hawk can give him, so he finds a thug named Vinnie and a Chinese grad student to help him navigate through the streets of Port City in this curious adventure.

This is the 14th Millhone book I've read, and it ranks as one of the top 3 or 4.  I don't understand all these other reviewers who downplayed it, but for me, this one had it all - great character development, a twisted but believable plotline, danger and action.  We know Kinsey is close to the killer from the start, but with so many suspects, who can she trust?  I loved the coded message, and the connections between Nota Lake and Santa Teresa/Perdido, etc.  Nota Lake sort of reminded me of the town from the TV series, Twin Peaks.

I've been reading the alphabet series in order, and although G-K were a little subpar, Sue Grafton proves here she's still got it.	2001-09-20

The major issue is the fate of Canada, when a secret treaty from Woodrow Wilson is discovered.  Dirk must find the actual treaty before some of the other nations' best spies find it.  Political intrigue abounds as English and French speaking Canadians work behind the scenes.  Sometimes its hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  Indeed, when the Canadian Prime Minister's wife has her climatic scene, I was surprised at who was behind the manipulations.  I was also dissappointed in the US President's actions.	2001-09-10

The end had a surprise twist to it that I was not expecting.  I was troubled by two aspects of the book, however.  First, our hero is much too flawed.  Not only does he dabble in police brutality, but he seems to have deep seated psychological issues and he has no problem taking illegal narcotics.  Second, the dialog is unrealistically profane.  Come on.  I cannot believe that many people, especially upon first meeting each other, rip out such a high density of F words.  There doesn't seem to be any characters with a sense of decency or civility in the book.  Nevertheless, the crime drama is well paced and suspenseful, even if we do know who the killer is at the beginning.	2001-08-31

First, we have the crime story involving an old murder, a current murder, and a runaway teenager. Second, our hero is getting married, and she must fight crime inbetween wedding preparations. Third, the daughter of her longtime neighbor comes to harass her, providing unwanted distractions from the first two stories. The entire book is a pleasant and easy read. I appreciate the fact that J. A. Jance keeps the language at the PG level - too many modern authors think they must write R rated script in order to sell books.	2001-08-24

Patterson didn't insult the reader by hitting us over the head with explicit descriptions of the action, but the implications were stunning. Often, he would start a paragraph with a pronoun like &quot;he&quot;, and you start to think this is the same male person from the previous paragraph. Oh my, how could &quot;he&quot; be doing that? But as you continue reading, you realize Patterson has deliberately misled the reader and you get to recover a couple of pages later. (Ah - so &quot;he&quot; was the bad guy after all.) The last 50 pages were very thrilling, especially the action in Sarah's apartment. I was dissappointed, however, in that all of our heroes did not directly participate in the final climatic scene.	2001-08-24

So McGee goes to Fort Courtney to observe the daughter, her sister and her husband.  What McGee encounters is a series of unusual circumstances, including dead bodies, cheating spouses, and the evidence that somebody is spying on him.  Could all of these things be connected? Sure - but only McGee could figure out the complicated connection.  True to most McGee novels, justice is served in the end, although in a form the reader does not expect.<br />This is my 11th McGee novel.  Clearly MacDonald writes in a more sophisticated style than 98% of the mystery writers today.  A new reader may find it annoying that one must suffer through a good 100 pages before the action really begins, but this is typical MacDonald style.  Not only do you get a complex mystery, but you get a lot of philosophy along the way.	2001-08-16

Kinsey digs into the past of an unsolved murder victim, to discover ties to organized crime, prostitution, and local government corruption.  Along the way, Kinsey gets help from a new police character, a single man known as Cheney.  Several suspects emerge, including some of the victim's family members, who don't seem to appreciate Kinsey's nosing around.  When we finally find the killer at the end, I was expecting the standard Sue Grafton crafted dramatic shoot-out, but this one ended differently.  If the ending at been less of a yawner, I would have bumped the book up to 4 stars.	2001-08-11

The leading character, Detective J. P. Beaumont is a flawed hero with real human qualities.  His life is in turmoil as he juggles the evolving multiple homicide with a number of side issues.  I wonder how he could sleep.  <br />Most of the book is fairly believable.  However, I could not get into the Grace Highsmith character, and her performance at the end was certainly &quot;over the top.&quot;  In the end, Beaumont wraps up the complicated story and the remnants of his personal life, leaving the reader satisfied.	2001-07-29

Madriani relocates from Sacramento, err, Capital City to a beautiful seaside residence in San Diego.  Harry Hinds gladly comes with him, but unfortunately, we leave the Coconut (Judge Acosta) behind in this new thriller.  The title initially led me to think Madriani himself would be on trial in this one, just like Acosta was in &quot;The Judge&quot;.  However, the story is another standard Madriani tale, much like &quot;Compelling Evidence&quot; or &quot;Undue Influence&quot;.  Our hero has a new girlfriend in this one, and his relationship with her causes some professional issues.  He initially starts out with his client in an attempt to find a way to bring legal pressure to get his kidnapped grandaughter back from his estranged daughter.  However, this quickly turns into a murder case as the grandfather is linked by the police to the death of an unattractive woman whose crusade is to help women steal children away from oppressive men.  We also get caught up with a Mexican drug dealer, some mysterious DEA (?) agents, and other dead bodies along the way. In the end, Martini throws in the twist out of nowhere to shock us with the truth about the killer.  My only complaint is that Martini could have added a couple of more pages of explanation as to how all of the evidence fit into the true killer's story.	2001-07-27

We aimlessly wander through a series of improbable events, with no proof of their connection (only a bunch of postulations offered by Scarpetta, Marino and their FBI pals).  In the end, we don't really know who committed the murder that kicked the whole thing off, which was very dissappointing to me.

Stephanie Plum is like Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, with a Jersey attitude.  The characters are so real, but humerous.  The danger is thrilling as Stephanie weaves her way through the ghetto to get her man.  How can you resist a book that features a cousin named Vinny, a mentor named Ranger, a neighborhood pizza parlor, diving into a dumpster to find the car keys, a butcher/bookmaker named Sal, a geriatric flasher, and a fictional Mike Tyson? Not to mention Mama, Grandma and the nice young man they invite for dinner who sells appliances.  This book has attitude - mystery with humor.  Please, Hollywood, make it a movie.	2001-07-07

First, history will be re-written with amazing revelations that tickle the imagination.  Second, Dirk Pitt will put James Bond to shame.  Once again, Cussler delivers a fanciful adventure on the high seas, where Pitt and company race against the Soviets to get the precious cargo aboard the Titanic.  Pitt comes off as the superhero who refuses to die, even when the odds are a million to one against him.  In this one, Pitt manages to solve a pretty complicated puzzle with powers of deduction that I do not believe ordinary mortals possess.  Just when the Soviets think they have the upper hand, Pitt saves the free world.  One flaw in Pitt did disappoint me, however.  I was dismayed when our hero committed adultery.  How could you, Dirk?

Along the way, Kinsey discovers sinister events associated with another private investigator who dug the same ground she was treading.  The ending was a bit abrupt.  It was another one of those endings where Kinsey gets into a spot of danger, and must deal with the guilty in order to save her own life.

We enter the lives of an international gang of mercenaries on a special mission to rescue a kidnapped daughter of a multi-millionaire on the island of Sicily.  Soon we find out one of our heroes has mafia connections, and the story changes character.  This book is a very quick read.

This time, the Coconut (Judge Acosta) gets in trouble, and our hero, Paul Madriani must bail him out.  Not only was I impressed with Madriani's legal skill, but the ending was a real zinger.  I was stunned, and I'm sure you will be too.  I was going along, thinking I knew who the real killer was.  Martini led me astray, with subtle clues, but the real killer -- wow!

Something was missing to make this another great book.  I liked the idea of Kinsey going out of the country, pursuing a missing person who faked their death.  Some of the action was exciting, and I liked the question left hanging at the end.  There were several surprises along the way, but they didn't all make perfect sense.  I didn't like Kinsey's cousins.  This side story was a distraction.  Usually, Sue Grafton weaves in a clever side story, but this one didn't click for me.  Final note - I'm not sure where &quot;Judgement&quot; fits into the story.	2001-06-11

I was starting to hope that Dillon would go the way of the Soak Hole, and I'm sorry, but I have no sympathy for Lady Helen, despite what the President may think.

Not only was it entertaining, but also educational.  I loved learning details of legal proceedings, as well as the medical information on human hairs and lividity.  Our hero was in a pinch at one point (the newspaper article), but skillfully got out of it.  I doubt many lawyers in real life would do so well.  All during the book, I focused on the wrong suspect, not realizing that the clues were there all along.

However, she gets tangled up in a most unusual situation, as a virtual hostage in a Latino run auto insurance fraud ring.  This is the only alphabet book I have read where Kinsey is not working for a client, and I guess this is part of the reason I thought this book was sub-par, by Sue Grafton standards.  There is little mention of the usual Santa Teresa characters.  Even so, this book was an easy page turner, as all other alphabet books are.  If this is your first Millhone mystery, don't worry.  Most of them are much, much better.	2001-05-26

I kept wanting the two plotlines to link up into a single story, but this never happened.  There were several things about the book that were lacking.  First, I never understood how the hitman got ahead of Kinsey in her trip down to the Salton Sea.  I mean, come on, how could he anticipate which rest stop she would use?  The killer seemed to have passed up several opportunities to get her, which also didn't make sense.   And the Dietz character also didn't make sense.  Yea, right, he decided to be her free bodyguard, then without much todo, he leaves at the end.  The story was well written, however, and the connection to the 19th century sisters was well thought out.

Most of them are much, much better.  This book suffers from an overload of the author's rambling commentary on society.  After the introduction to jealous husband, you have to slug through 100 pages before you begin to get into typical Travis McGee action.  The action is often illogical, and too often Travis - err - Gavin stumbles into old friends at the most unlikely places, bailing him out of trouble.  Sorry, this one just didn't click for me.

In addition, the action and adventure of the pre-trial investigation, complete with bombs and bullets, had me turning the pages in rapid succession.  My only complaint was how the ending left the problem that some of the events were extremely coincidental - would have been much nicer if they had all been truly related in some &quot;cause and effect&quot; manner.

Lots of action, well paced, and of course, the classic Cussler formula.  Just take a historical figure (Einstein), add some fiction (discovery of the unified field theory), change Dirk Pitt into John Taft, change Al Giordino into Larry Martinez, change Admiral Sandecker into General Benson, and you've got it.  I started to lose it in the last 50 pages, when the unified field theory manifested itself into something beyond this universe.  I would have called this a 4 star book, but my sense of duty to the true laws of physics forced me to downgrade the over-the-top ending.  Too much of the action in the end was also unbelievable from the standpoint that you couldn't possibly organize that many humans to conduct that much action so quickly.  For example, I recall in real life that it takes months to deploy Army divisions across the globe (remember the Desert Shield build-up?).  In this book, it seems to happen in a couple of days with minimal effort.  The best part of this book was the opening escape sequence.  Nice try Clive, err, Craig Dirgo.	2001-04-21

I've enjoyed Millhone's A-E mysteries, but F took her detective skills to a new level.  What a pleasure it was to take a vacation with Kinsey, in Floral Beach.  I thought Santa Teresa was interesting, but this town made Peyton Place look like Leave it to Beaver.  There were so many interesting and inter-related characters, that in order to keep up (and not miss out), I had to keep a notepad, jotting down the relationship each character had with others.  Several times I thought I was onto the murderer, but this one kept me in the dark until the thrilling end.  I could just feel my heart beating faster as Kinsey was on the run.  I was pleased that all the loose ends got tied up in the end, with good explanations for all the bizarre behavior.  Sue Grafton, you hit the top with this one!	2001-04-11

This is about the 10th McGee book I've read, and like the others, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Like so many others, it starts out with our hero's newest girlfriend, who you know will not live to the end of the story.  Travis must avenge her wrongful death, which leads him to the strangest adventure he's ever had.  Mysterious government agents enlist his help (who are those guys?).  He stumbles into Camp Weirdo, a cross between Jonestown and Usama Bin-Laden's training center, where he isn't supposed to escape.  Since the camp's residents are little more than automatons, I had little sympathy for what Travis had to do. You know Travis will be resourceful, since he has several more colorful adventures ahead.  I would have given this the full 5 stars, except there were too many loose ends left unanswered.  I almost thought (though I know better) that MacDonald left them on purpose to support a future McGee story.	2001-03-24

It is written in an old fashioned, innocent style, suitable for juveniles as well as little old ladies.  I have never read a Daheim book before.  It kind of reminded me of Jessica Fletcher on &quot;Murder She Wrote.&quot;  There were plenty of inter-related characters and lots of suspects.  The end was pleasantly surprising, but some of the loose ends were never tied well.  The book was OK, but I would rather stick with other mystery writers.	2001-03-24
