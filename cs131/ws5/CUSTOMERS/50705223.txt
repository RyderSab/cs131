US	50705223	RG3EZNLWK5J9T	044023722X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great Weekend Read	I have read many of John Grisham's books, and so far have not been disappointed.  This book probably moved a little slower than his other books, which is why I'm only giving four stars instead of five.  But I must say to the reviewer who did not read beyond chapter 3 -- YOU MUST READ FURTHER.  I admit myself that I found the first several chapters rather uninteresting, but things tie together quite well near the middle of the book.  You need to read at least that far to get to know some of the characters.  I also was slightly disappointed in the ending, because I felt that there were a few parts of the story unfinished. For example, there was a character of Ricky Chandler, who was constantly mentioned throughout the book, but never materialized.  <BR>But what I thought was the redeeming quality of this book was its main character, Luke Chandler.  He may only be seven years old, but is wise well beyond his years.  I also enjoyed reading about the general lifestyle of 1950's rural Arkansas, it's always enjoyable to be brought to a different time and place.<BR>Over all, I would definitely recommend this book as a good read, though it is definitely not Grisham's most exciting book.	2003-09-14

How many times I haven't wanted to just focus on the true meaning of Christmas and not get caught by the commercial trappings this holiday brings every year.  But it was the characters of this book that left me disappointed.<br />First the neighbors: if my neighbors harassed me the way the Krank's neighbors did, I would be searching for greener pastures in no time.  How you choose to celebrate the holiday is your own business, no one else's.<br />Then the wife, Nora - Good Lord, why didn't she just tell her daughter the truth?!  There is nothing wrong with what she and her husband were planning, in fact it's not that uncommon for couples whose children are grown to get out of town for Christmas.  My husband and I contemplated it many times before our children were born.<br />And then the daughter - to just assume that her parents would have the home fires burning the way they've always been...and show up practically unannounced and assume that her parents couldn't possibly have other plans...what a selfish brat!<br />The reason I am giving this book three stars instead of one or two was because of the way the neighbors did come through in the end, and it was a light, funny read.  I agree with some of the other readers that it would make a great comedy movie...although I picture Craig T. Nelson as Luther.  Just a thought.	2003-08-21

Since then, it is my 3-year old's favorite book.  His favorite animal is an elephant, and he likes the pictures in this book better than some of his other elephant books.  The pictures are very well done, and even though the little elephant is very worried, nothing in this book is portrayed as scary.  One piece of advice, though, be very careful how you handle the pop-up portions of the book, my children broke one of them within a couple days.  You may want to keep this book somewhere for safe keeping rather than just let your kids handle it whenever or however they want.	2003-03-23

I just can't relate to their lives very much and they usually come across as selfish and rather uncaring.  No different here.  I also do not like to have real-life celebrities mixed in with fictional characters (such as the scenes from Tess's wedding).  When I read a fictional book, I like the characters to all be fictional.  Which is probably one of the main reasons I don't like celebrity books.<BR>  Another thing that irked me was the portrayal of Judy.  The scene in the hospital cafeteria was especially annoying, like what you eat makes you the person you are.  I am only a size 4, but I still get annoyed at the way society sees skinny people as better than overweight people.  No wonder so many teen-age girls have eating disorders.  And why did Judy hate Tess so much?  We never know.<BR>  I also didn't think the author did very much with the character of Kenny, she didn't take me inside his thoughts very much so I really couldn't tell how he was really feeling.  The whole book focused on Tess's thoughts and she was a very shallow person.<BR>   I also agree with another reviewer that it's hard to get past the fact that the hero was stolen from someone else.  Come to think of it, that's very common in Spencer's books.  Think of Bittersweet, Separate Beds, Vows, Spring Fancy....<BR>  Tess's relationship with her mother was the redeeming quality for this book.  I think many people can relate to leaving home for a long time and being irritated by our parents when we return.  That was the one relationship in the book that really progressed well.  And I also liked the relationship between Tess and Casey, though I do question whether it's realistic or not.<BR>  Overall, it's good because it's Lavyrle Spencer, but I don't think I'll be buying this one.	2003-03-17

The reason I'm giving this book three stars is because there were some things about the book I liked, and some I didn't.<BR>First of all, no woman, not even a supermom, could manage five kids, and a heavy-load law practice by herself, with just a part time housekeeper.  I also didn't think that the younger boy seemed handicapped, he seemed to actually be quite intelligent.  I liked the character of the doctor at first, but then he runs out on her and ends the relationship just because her daughters are nasty to him because they're not over their father's death?  And then he just suddenly shows up at the end of the book, like nothing happened!  Also, I didn't feel like the author really finished the story, it seemed like it ended too soon.<BR>On the plus side, however, I felt the author did an accurate portrayal of how the kids reacted to their mother dating again, I would expect in that situation that some would be for it, some against.  I also liked the characters in the story, especially Peter.  Liz's grief was also played out very realistically.<BR>Overall, it's a good book to read if you need to pass some time but I wouldn't spend money on it.	2002-12-27

I have read all of Lavyrle Spencer's books and I have to admit that this one is not my favorite.  But there is something about this book that is different from the rest.  This book does not focus on a new romance, or rekindling an old one, like the rest of Spencer's books.  This is about a happy, well-adjusted family who gets hit by a catalyst and has to deal with the consequences of a mistake the father made 18 years ago.<BR>  I liked the all of the characters in this but I did get really tired of the way Claire stayed angry at Tom, not because of what he did, but because she refused to believe that he wasn't fooling around in the present.  That just got old after awhile.  I really liked the way the kids reconciled at the end, though.<BR>  All in all, I did really enjoy this book and would recommend it as a good, light read, just don't expect a romance novel.	2002-08-03
US	50705223	R3VBPWJ4ZKAALW	0515124621	346193544	Then Came Heaven	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Touching Story	This was truly a heartwarming and beautiful story.  I've noticed in other Lavyrle Spencer books I've read that she does an incredible job of painting the picture of a grieving person.  This book was no exception.  I felt so much pain for Eddie and his daughters.  And I could always feel the other characters' pain as well, especially Regina's. <BR>Another thing I enjoyed about this book was the setting.  The town she wrote about could have been the hometown I grew up in, except everyone was Dutch and Christian instead of Polish and Catholic.  But the way of life was the same.<BR>The only reason I gave this book only four stars instead of five is because there was a lot of focus on Catholisism, and since I'm not Catholic, I didn't find some of it interesting.  Maybe because I don't understand a lot of it. I was amazed, however, at how much the nuns were isolated from everyone.  I always had the misconception that they were out in the world helping people, but these nuns weren't allowed much at all.  That aspect was very interesting.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers that this wasn't Spencer's best, and it is a little disappointing that she retired on this note.  Even though I liked this story, it just didn't have that &quot;can't put it down&quot; experience like I usually get from Spencer's books.  But I do recommend this book if you like a sweet love story with a happy ending.	2002-06-19
US	50705223	RNN4G1HV4BVV7	051508901X	861253564	The Gamble	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Beautiful characters and story	I have read many books by this author, and one problem that I have with them is that I usually don't like the female lead character.  Quite often, they're too sharp-tongued and hard-edged for my tastes.  And I have to admit after reading the first couple chapters of this book, I thought I was in for more of the same.  But once I got to the scene where Agatha and Violet are sewing with the dancers, I knew this was going to be different.  I absolutely loved the character of Agatha, along with all the other main characters.  Agatha has a heart of gold, and yet she is able to stand up for what she believes in, even if it means risking her chance for love.  You can really feel her pain, but yet you don't feel sorry for her either.  A perfect lead character.  As for Scott, I knew right away that he would keep me laughing through the whole book.  I also like the way the author threw in Jesse and Abigail DuFrayne from her book &quot;Hummingbird&quot;, even though I did not like that book very well. This was one of the best I've read from this author.  It will be very difficult to find an author that can write romance as well as Lavyrle Spencer can.	2002-01-10

I am not a Danielle Steel fan, and I have to admit that I've written some unfavorable reviews about her here.  But the storyline of this book sounded interesting to me, so I decided to try it.  At first, I couldn't say I was overly impressed, until the character of Sarah Ferguson entered the picture.  Then I was hooked.  The author did an incredible job of weaving the two stories together, of making Charlie and Francesca learn to love through the story of Sarah and Francois.  I also liked the way she didn't bog me down with a lot of characters to try to keep straight.  Both of the stories were fairly simple.  The characters of Sarah and Francois were much more exciting and likeable, but Charlie and Francesca grew as the story continued.  However, I do feel that the author could have cut the beginning part of the book in half.  We were pretty much able to figure out that Charlie was miserable on the first page, but it seemed like this kept going and going...I would rather she made the end a little longer, by dealing more with his romance with Francesca.  But regardless, this was the best Danielle Steel I've read since Mixed Blessings.	2001-11-18

I enjoyed every page of it!  Usually in the past I've found romance novels to be either sappy or sad or both.  But a good romantic comedy is hard to come by.  The author does a wonderful job of incorporating humor into the story, and still you can feel the heat between the two main characters even though they refuse to see it.  Reading about Hallie's disasterous dates was extremely entertaining.  Another thing I enjoyed was the setting, being from the Pacific Northwest myself, I recognized many of the places referred to in this book.  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants entertainment, but nothing super-deep.  This book also made me rather glad I got married when I was 20!	2001-11-13

My husband and I had to see a specialist in order to conceive our first child, so I always find these type of books interesting.  However, the problem I had with this book was that I HATED the lead female character.  She was the most selfish, inconsiderate person I've ever read about.  She had no consideration for her husband's feelings at all.  I understand that the hormones can make things difficult, but you can take breaks from fertility treatments for God's sake! (that's how my husband and I dealt with this--when I started getting stressed, we took a couple months off)  And throughout the entire book she whined and complained about how inconsiderate her husband is being, and the whole time she's picking fights, refusing to take a break, committing criminal acts, and flying all over the world against her husband's wishes?!  Give me a break!<br />I also thought the book became rather dull when she ended up in Hong Kong.  That part of the book could have been much shorter.<BR>  <BR>On a more positive note, I really enjoyed reading about the in-vitro aspect, fortunately I didn't have to go that far to have a child of my own.  My husband and I always said we wouldn't go that far, and after reading this book, I believe that would hold true.  I also enjoyed the storyline for the most part, and if it weren't for the character of Marissa, I probably would have given this book four stars.  I'll have to read Outbreak, and see if I like her better there.	2001-11-09

The idea of a woman finding a love letter in a bottle, and becoming obsessed with finding the man who wrote it, really facinated me (OK, I'll admit, I enjoyed Sleepless in Seattle).  But the characters and storyline left me feeling a bit flat.  It started out good, she found the man fairly easily and they hit it off great.  But I didn't think there was very much depth to her character, not that her character was bad or anything, I just felt the author didn't do her justice.  Garrett started off as a good character, but it really turned me off that they went to bed the second time they met.  A man who is portrayed to be as sensitive and in love with his deceased wife as Garrett was just simply would not do that!  It also made me a bit angry that Theresa did not tell Garrett about the letters right away, it made me think that she was deceptive.  <BR>Another thing, to me this book seemed extremely sad, even at parts when they were happy, there was some underlying gloom.  Because of this, I was able to guess quite easily how the story would end, which was not how I wanted it to end.<BR>Overall, I would say that this was a good way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon, but I don't think I'll read this one again.	2001-11-07

I am a big Spencer fan, and intend to read all her books, so I finally checked this out from the library and surprise! -- I really enjoyed it.  I had a very difficult time putting this down.  I didn't like the character of Rye at first, but later in the book I was able to sympathize with all the characters, I mean, what a dilemma!  I didn't like the way Dan handled the situation, but how else would a man act when he realizes that out of the blue he's going to lose the wife and son he loves?  I also enjoyed the sparring between Rye and his father, I wish the author could have brought a little more of it into the story.  The one thing I didn't like was the ending; I know the story could not have ended any other way, but it was sad none the less, I especially felt sorry for Josh at that point.  I would definitely recommend this book, but I can only give four stars.  Five stars need to be saved for other Spencer books like Morning Glory, November of the Heart, and Family Blessings.	2001-10-28

He now has it memorized and is reciting it to me.  He loves it because it follows a familiar routine: his bedtime ritual (except for the exercise, but he loves the silliness of that part).  Even our three-and-a-half year old comes over when I read this.  I also think the pictures really get his attention.  Our two-year-old is even throwing in some motions (rocking, scrubbing) when I read it.  I'm looking forward to Christmas when I can buy them some more of this author.	2001-08-21

After reading some of the reviews here, I get the impression that it probably was not the best way to start reading Jane Smiley.  It was a very disturbing book in many ways, but I knew that I was not out to read a romance novel. The biggest complaint that I had, though, was that the author seemed to go on so many tangents throughout the book.  I expect quite a bit of history on the characters in the beginning of the book, but once the story starts I like it to keep moving.  It seemed like the first 20 chapters or so, would start with a long detailed description of something from the main character's childhood, then the last half of the chapter would go the the plot of the book, and then the next chapter we're back in childhood again.  Because of this I found the book to be somewhat boring and that's why I'll give it only three stars.  But when the story was moving (especially at the end) I really enjoyed it.   I also think that I would have enjoyed the book more if the author had spent a little more time on certain issues.  It felt like there were some loose ends in the story that weren't explained very well, like why did Ty suddenly become so cold to Ginny?  And I also would have liked a little more drama between Jess and Ginny, that part of the story just didn't seem exciting enough compared to the rest of the book; it almost seemed like it didn't belong in there.  And why did Pete do what he did at the end? And more should have been spent on the actual reason behind Ginny's miscarriages, the mental problems, and why so many died of cancer in the neighborhood. That was a very important part of the book but you really have to pay close attention to get that aspect of the story.  Just not enough detail where it mattered, and too much detail where it didn't, that's the biggest complaint I had about this book. Overall, except for some boring parts, I did enjoy reading this book, despite thedisturbing characters and storyline.	2001-02-20

We had a rather rough time getting him interested in books and one day when he was about 28 months old I got this book out (I'd been saving it) and he actually sat still long enough for the whole story.  That was what finally gave him an interest in books.  He soon had the book memorized and had something funny to say at every page.  Now our 18-month old son brings this book to me at least three times a day and enjoys it as much as his brother did (whose main interest is now Winnie-the-Pooh books).  I enjoy reading it myself; it doesn't bore me to read it over and over like some children's books because there are so many different things in the illustrations that you can point out something new to your child every time you read it. I recommend this book for any new parents.	2001-02-03

I'm not surprised by how many bad reviews this first book received, but it's not a good idea to judge the whole series by this first book.  The first five or six books are an introduction of the main characters.  And yes, the stories are very unrealistic, but that was the whole reason I wanted to read them, so I could escape to a different place.  Later in the series, the Wakefield family does tackle some difficult issues, such as cancer, drugs, and a separation.  I can understand where some readers would be pretty disgusted with these books if they were looking for deep reading, but that is just not what these books are meant to give, so take them for what they are and just pretend awhile!	2000-10-19

I still read it about once a year and enjoy it every time.  Each of the characters blends into the story well.  I don't usually cry or laugh when I read novels but this was an exception.  I could feel the heartache each time Will and Elly said good-bye during the war, and the emotional pain that Will brought home with him.  I laughed out loud while I read the court scene near the end, especially at the two old guys, Nat and Norris.  All through the book I wondered what role those two would play, and I was not disappointed.  The only complaint I have is the same one I have with many Lavyrle Spencer books - I always think she ends the story too soon, and I'm always left to wonder what happened to the characters.  I guess I just have to imagine that Will and Elly lived happily ever after.  I wish she would come out of retirement to write sequels to Morning Glory, Bittersweet, and Separate Beds.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story with a happy ending.	2000-10-15

Farmer Boy was the last  one I read, because it wasn't about Laura.  But I think I enjoyed it more  than the others, mainly because the Wilder family didn't have to endure as  many hardships as the Ingalls' family.  Because of this, I think that there  was a lot more humor put into this book.  My husband didn't read these  books as a child, but he loves the chapter where Almanzo outsmarted  everyone when they were shearing the sheep.  Even though times were harder  back then,  I think this family really had something special that the world  lacks today.	2000-09-07

I picked this book up again this week for lack of  anything better to read, and was very surprised.  I enjoyed the book much  more this time, and decided I was too hasty in my comments before.  From  now on I'll read a book twice before I review it.  I really admired the  character of Clay, he really owned up to his responsibilities throughout  the book.  I just wished he'd fallen in love with Catherine sooner.  I  think that's what disappointed me about this book before, was that she knew  early on she loved him but he was only interested in her for one thing.   Also, the first time I read it I got tired of reading about all of her  problems, but this time I admired her for overcoming them in spite of the  family life she had.  I still don't think this is Ms. Spencer's best work,  but it's definitely not as bad as the review I gave before.	2000-09-07

I can't say that it was the  best, but it was good.  I've always found the Titanic story rather  interesting, which is probably why I checked it out of the library.  One  thing I really enjoyed about this book more than the movie (the one with  Leo and Kate) was that it emphasized what happened after the disaster, and  how the people who survived had to cope.  Imagine seeing the ship go down,  losing loved ones, and then having to face news reporters when you returned  to New York.  It was just a side of the story I never thought about until I  read this book.  I do agree with some of the other readers that Edwina's  mother should not have been portrayed as a heroine for going down with her  husband.  When you bring children into this world, it is your  responsibility to do whatever it takes to be there for them, and to raise  them.  I saw her act as child abandonment, not heroism.  That's probably  why I couldn't give the book five stars.  Being a mother myself, I had a  little trouble getting past it.  Other than that though, it was an  enjoyable read.	2000-09-04

If my husband refused to support me if I went through something  like that, it would be a pretty hard thing to get over.  I believe that  most marriages begin with the bride and groom saying something to the  effect of &quot;for better or for worse!?&quot;  I felt that the ending of  this book was a bit of an insult to couples who really actually believe  that (there are still plenty of us out there, believe me!)

I do not understand how this could be possible, but I found this book to  be totally predictable and unbelievable at the same time.  I just could not  sympathize with any of the characters, especially the grown children.   Maybe I would have liked the story better without the Hollywood glitz, but  probably not much.  I always knew what was going to happen next, and  throughout the whole book I just wanted to shout at the charcters &quot;GET  REAL!!&quot;  So far I have read about 20 books from this author and the  only ones I've liked have been Mixed Blessings, Accident, Daddy, and The  Gift.  I'm seriously considering giving up on Danielle Steel.  It amazes me  that she's sold as many books as she has; I'm not even going to get into  the grammatical problems she has.

And the parts where  Emily lost her temper with Tom were very entertaining.  Even though this  type of story is predictable, I enjoy novels where the couple start as  adversaries and gradually fall in love throughout the course of the book.  And anyone who loves caring for animals as much as Emily did is a real  heroine as far as I'm concerned.  I also liked reading about life in  Wyoming in the 1800's, it reminded me a little of how much I enjoyed  reading about Laura Ingalls Wilder when I was young.  This is a great book  to read if you just want to escape the realities of this time for a while.	2000-08-29

In fact, the onlycharacters I really liked were Gabe, his brother, and the DuMosses.  I admired Roberta for making a new life for herself and her daughters, but she was always so touchy and defensive.  I guess I just don't enjoy books that involve either man or woman bashing. ... Another thing - I think the storyline of one of the lead characters not getting along with a parent is too common in Spencer's books (i.e. Bittersweet, Family Blessings, Separate Beds) It wasn't a bad book, but just seemed different than her other books.	2000-08-23
US	50705223	R3TCH6J0EQLJPK	0515115630	461297317	Family Blessings	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of her best	When I started to read this book, I didn't think I would like it because  of the age thing (and yes, I would have a problem if it were a 45 year old  man and a 30 year old woman).  But once I started reading and getting to  know the characters, that issue became mute.  Both Lee and Christopher  handled their grief incredibly well, and the friendship they developed  before love should be an example to us all.  Also, the relationship that  Christopher developed with Joey - you couldn't find a better father-figure  whether he was 30 or 50.  This will be one of my favorite books for life.	2000-08-23

The book was long but it never got boring.  In fact, I felt like the  author left some big gaps in Judith's life, like what happened between her  first Easter break with the Carey-Lewis clan and her final year at school?   And after Loveday's wedding?  I have always been facinated with the WW2 era  and I really enjoyed getting this piece of history from the British point  of view.  There were parts of the book that were a bit predictable, but I  think I would have been disappointed if those things hadn't happened.  I do  wish that the book hadn't ended quite so soon, I would have liked the story  of Judith and Jeremy to go a bit further, in fact I wish that Jeremy would  have been featured in the entire book a bit more, instead of so much  Edward.  Actually, the whole Carey-Lewis family got on my nerves after a  while, I enjoyed reading about Uncle Bob, Aunt Biddy and Phyllis much more,  they were much more real.  But this is a book I will definitely read again.   I wish there could be a sequel, I would like to know what happened to  everyone from 1945-1955.	2000-08-16
US	50705223	R1U7J67JTBU827	051511054X	259550786	Bygones	Books	5	7	10	N	N	one of my favorites	I first read this five years ago and still have trouble putting it down (even on the re-reads!)  I appreciate the storyline here so much more than in Bittersweet (where one of the main characters is married to someone  else) Seeing a divorced couple get back together with encouragement from  one of their children is a refreshing plotline, and the story moved along  at just the right pace.  The characters in this story were all believable  and likable, and the ending in this book didn't leave me feeling like I'd  just read a fairy tale.  The only beef I had was that I personally don't  know very many parents who would give their daughter that grand of a  wedding when there's a baby on the way.  But other than that, I think it's  one of her best.	2000-06-21
US	50705223	R419CFKKZ0OSR	039914014X	207017783	Home Song	Books	4	1	2	N	N	read it in one day	Like most of Lavyrle Spencer's books, I had a tough time putting this one down.  I do agree with the one reader that her portrayal of teenagers in this book is a bit unrealistic, and I had a difficult time warming up to  the character of Claire.  The character of Monica seemed better for the  heroine than Claire, and I know this was not what the author intended. I  absolutely loved the part of the book where Kent met his grandfather and  great uncle, they were the best characters in the book by far.  The ending  also didn't sit quite right with me, I just don't think that it would be  possible for everyone to be &quot;friends&quot; after what they went  through, especially between Claire and Kent.  But I thought that the story  moved really well and I was always wondering what would happen next, which  is what I look for in a good book.	2000-06-21
US	50705223	RG26XUHB86WDC	0515090379	679725329	Separate Beds	Books	2	4	5	N	N	not the best from this author	I have read many of Lavryle Spencer's books and this is the first time I have really been disappointed.  The story starts out great but then just moves too slow, and like the other reader mentioned, Clay and Catherine  just can't seem to get around their problems and grow up.  And so much of  the book focused on her problems instead of the growing attraction between  the two characters, which is usually what you get from Lavyrle Spencer  novels. Definitely not worth the time I spent on it.	2000-06-11
US	50705223	R1Y6PM6BLQGIL5	0385299109	341522717	Mixed Blessings	Books	5	2	2	N	N	very real story to me	I checked this book out of the library.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to read it because at the time I was suffering through my own infertility.  But once I started I was hooked.  I could relate to Diana so easily, the  heartache that occured at the same time each month, and the feeling that  there was something wrong long before I went to any doctor.  Like Diana, I  too was able to overcome this problem, and now have two beautiful sons (our  own biological children, too!) I didn't relate quite as well to the other  couples, but did find their stories facinating as well.  The research  Danielle Steel did was very good except for one flaw - when Pillar had her  miscarriage around New Year's she was back in getting another insemination  done the next month -I also had this procedure done and doctors will not do  this procedure for three months after a miscarriage.  Also her discription  of the procedure itself was a little different than mine.  But excellent  reading none the less!	2000-06-06
US	50705223	RNTM8AX10L46N	051510521X	639347172	Bitter Sweet	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Good reading	The storyline of this book is excellent(high school sweethearts reunited). Even though I didn't think I would like this book, I had a very difficult time putting it down because the majority of the characters including the  leads were very likeable.  However, I can only give this book four stars  because there were a few things in this book I just didn't like.  First of  all, I do not condone extra marital affairs.  Eric and Maggie should have  waited until he was divorced before they had sex.  Second, I am from the  Seattle area and I did not like the author's references to the Pacific  Northwest as a depressing, gloomy place.  The part of the book that took  place in Seattle also took place during the month of August which is  usually our driest month.  However, in this book, it was always raining.  I  also did not like the depiction of Katy as a brat, she had every right to  be angry at her mother. Lavyrle Spencer did do an excellent job of  describing the setting in Door County; it is now one of the places I would  most like to see. I would recommend this book for &quot;good&quot; reading  but it's not her best.	2000-06-03
