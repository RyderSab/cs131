I bought the deck based on the Major Arcana.  The minors look like they come from a completely different deck to me.  The majors all look mythological .. while the minors remind me of the deep south during early America.  So, I sold it.  I would just advise getting a look at all the cards before making a decision. (one good thing - the cards are not large so they are great for smaller hands. the size reminded me of the hanson-roberts deck)	2003-07-02

I loved the artwork and psychological concept of this deck.  It was truly beautiful and innovative.    The reason I gave this 2 stars is because the paper quality of the cards is absolutely awful.  I returned mine! A set this expensive with such poor quality cards in inexcusable.  The publisher should be ashamed.  I think it is a widespread problem, as I saw similar comments for the Tarot of Paris, which is published by the same people.  If you plan on using this deck for readings I'm not so sure its worth the $$ - as I can't see the cards lasting very long.  In addition to the very very thin paper stock, many of the edges were jagged.  The author and the artist should really have a word with the publisher. It is a shame!	2003-07-02

As another reviewer stated, they can easily be used even if you do not intend to practice the spells.  The cards all have beautiful pictures and a key word that corresponds to an area of life (ie. romance, organization, divine guidance, etc.).  The cards can easily be used as an oracle tool to find out what areas of life we should be focusing one.  Also, many of the &quot;spells&quot; are pretty easy - and could be incorporated as a little ritual to help guide your energy to that area of life.  Also, if you are interested in any type of witchcraft, but are a little apprehensive, I suppose these cards would do well as a lighthearted, yet powerful, introduction.	2003-04-14

I have read most of Doreen's books - she is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I just received this book in the mail yesterday, and I can definitely say it has become one of my most prized possessions.  If you enjoy working with your Angels - this book is a must have.  Although it is set up in dictionary / encyclopedia format, it in no way feels like you are reading an encyclopedia.  The first part of the book goes through each Deity individually - listing name, origin, and biographical story about that specific person.  Then it tells you what areas of life this deity works with, as well as an invocation to use.  The second half of the book lists specific life problems in alphabetical order.  Under each issue are all deities in the book that help with that specific issue.  There is also a section of prayers that you can use to invoke several of the deities at once - for a specific issue.  This book is comprehensive - and emits an amazingly loving feel.  Just perfect!	2003-04-09

This is by far the most beautiful deck of cards that I own.  Of course, I have an amazing love and appreciation of dolphins, so perhaps I am biased.  The artwork just seems magical to me.  If you own Doreen's Healing with the Fairies deck, it is similar - but this deck seems even more perfect to me.  There are dolpins and mermaids, of course... but there are also children and manatees and other magical creatures.  The artwork is fantasy / mythical.  Each card in the deck has a specific title at the top and then an accompanying message at the botton.  The messages in this deck are geared towards fulfilling your life purpose and goals / dreams.  I usually refer to this deck each night to see if I am on the right track...  This deck is so special , that I save it just for myself!!	2003-04-09

I have spent a great deal of time over the past few years trying to learn the tarot, as well as accumulating many decks.  Although I found the tarot fascinating and beneficial, many of the card images can be a little scary.  No one wants to do a reading for advice and wind up feeling scared!  Some people say this \\"shadow\\" element is necessary - and that you can't avoid life's tough lessons.  Still, I wound up selling most of my tarot stuff and gravitating toward more positive oracles.<br />When I read the description for this deck, I was so excited.  When I opened it, I was elated!  Lucy has created a Tarot deck that has kept with traditional meanings, while portraying them in a more positive, uplifting way.  The deck doesn't avoid tougher issues, its just not \\"three swords piercing your heart\\"... some of the cards have been renamed (death, devil, etc.)... to show their true meanings... . The court cards have also been eliminated - for me this was a blessing bc I had always found them difficult to read with.<br />I recognize that many tarot traditionalists will probably hate this deck... but if you are looking for a more positive spin of the tarot, this deck may very well be for you. the artwork is colorful and vibrant - and the little book is comprehensive.  Give it a try.	2003-04-09

I will agree with several of the other reviews - this book is not what you 'expect' it to be - but a very good book nonetheless.  When I saw the word &quot;companion&quot;, I assumed the book would read more as a study guide.  I assumed it would read more like a dictionary of people, places, and things, etc.  <br />This book is more like a walk through Tolkein's head.  Have you ever wondered &quot;Where did the word 'Hobbit' come from?&quot;  &quot;How did Tolkein come up with the names of his characters?&quot;  &quot;How did he build their personalities?&quot;<br />I found it interesting that Tolkein felt his characters more or less &quot;already existed in another realm and he needed to learn more about them as oppposed to him actually developing them.&quot;<br />I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I found it very interesting to learn how such a wonderful story actually came to be... and I thoroughly enjoyed the illustrations.	2002-11-08

All of Doreen's books are geared toward communicating w/ the angelic realm. Many are also \\"how to's\\" to aid each and every one of us to also communicate w/ the angels. However, most of us are not as proficient at this task as Doreen is.. and many of us have questions we wish the angels would answer.<br />This book is almost like a \\"Frequently Asked Question\\" list... Doreen provides Divine Prescriptions, directly from the angels, on many of life's questions and issues. You could read through the book all at once, or use it as a reference whenever somethign specific pops up.<br />There is also a portion of the book devoted to helping us \\"receive these messages on our own\\".. and a section on how to give an angel reading and use the oracle cards... I found this section especially helpful..	2002-09-13

If you can you deal with the sometimes immature and contrived conversation between the two main characters, you will find yourself hooked on an excellent storyline.  This thriller was chock full of suspense, and kept me turning the pages as quickly as I could... Definitely a worthwhile read.  I am anxious to explore future titles by this author.	2002-09-13

She is truly the author that paved my way into the spiritual world.  I have never been disappointed by her.. and these cards are no exception.<br />I have all three of her oracle decks.  My favorite are the fairy cards - they just &quot;click&quot; with me in such a way.  While I do like her first angel cards.. these are even BETTER. The pictures are just beautiful.<br />This deck is structured differently than her previous Healing Oracle cards - instead of using a keywork on each card, a specific message is provided.  Each card actually names an angel, so you can tie the message to the appropriate angel you should be working with for that goal / purpose.<br />Spreads are provided to use - but I really find that these cards work best when you pull one card for an individual question - since they are so specific.  When I want to do a more 'divinitory' reading utilizing spreads, I pick up the Healing with your Fairies or Healing w/ your Angel cards.<br />If you purchase this deck, you will not be disappointed.	2002-09-13

However, it is definitely for the \\"true believer\\" or the very \\"open minded\\".. If you are just opening yourself to the possiblilty of animal-human telepathic communication, this may not be the best place to start.  This book delves much deeper, discussing animal past lives, inter-species reincarnation, life on other planets, multi-dimensional living, etc... There are points in the book that actually state \\"Those that are ready for this will read it, those that aren't won't.. \\"  <br />But, if you are truly open to the many possibilities out there, you will love this book.  There is so much for us to learn from the animals.  Each one offers a different perspective and a unique knowledge base.  This book opens your heart and your mind.. making you realize how limiting humans are .. and how much they close themselves off to.  <br />Dawn Baumann Burke is a wonderful author.  She takes you on her own journey.. She doesn't ask you to just accept what she says.. she shares her own battles with doubt and wonderment.. <br />An excellent read!!.. One caution: If you are looking for a book that is mainly a 'HOW TO' for animal communication, that is not the main focus of this book... Still, if I could keep only one Animal Communication book in my library (I have several).. THIS would be it!	2002-09-13

When I stared at the mosaic they created, I was truly mesmerized.  The colors in this deck are so vibrant.. they scream at you.. yet they are not harsh or garish at all.  This deck combines people of every age, size, race, etc... and it does it in truly unique ways.. The pictures are illustrated so completely.. both the Majors and Minors offer so much material to work with.  There are so many symbols in the cards, I imagine I will continue finding something new each time I look.  Also, the images are very similar to the Rider Waite, so the deck doesn't have a real learning curve.. it just offers new depth to explore.  The book that comes with the cards does offer nice deck specific information, although it could have gone a lot deeper into the symbols used.. I would love to see an expanded edition... But, overall, I really love this deck!!	2002-08-14

For both purposes, it would be truly excellent. However, I fall into the third category, the one you find in parenthesis, as not to alienate the adult that finds this deck wonderful... (The Young at Heart). I love this deck!!  <br />Since I became interested in Tarot, I have bought close to two dozen decks.. and this is the only one I currently have not sold.  This deck appealed to me for two reasons.. The first being it has NO scary images. While I am quite interested in tarot, I find that many of the cards are downright negative and fearful.  While many people argue that this \\"shadow\\" side is necessary in cards, I beleive it can be accomplished in more gentle ways.  There is so much negativity and violence in the world.. and we are all so tough on ourselves already.  When I sit down for advice and counsel from my cards, I don't need to be scared. For this reason, I have migrated more to Angel and Fairy oracle decks. It can be tough reading for yourself when some of those sword cards pop up,etc. This deck makes you feel good, even when delivering life's tougher messages... <br />Second, this deck is so easy to relate to.. Since the cards all depict fairy tales, fables, or nursery rhymes..  the association makes it VERY easy to learn. Alas, a good deck for beginners as well. I would reccomend getting the book by Dorothy Morriosn.  Even though you could easily read the cards if you are familiar with the stories, the book really is helpful in providing more detailed descriptions and revealing more depth. Perhaps this won't be your only deck as it currently is mine, but it is certainly a refreshing one to pull out when you need more gentle advice.. A+	2002-08-14

Although Pilates isn't hard to learn, it definitely needs to be done correctly to be beneficial - and sans a costly personal instructor - very good instructions are needed.  As pilates has hit the mainstream, so many books and videos have popped up - and I have tried many.  However, I never really could tell if I was \\"doing it right\\".. there was always 'something' about the exercise the book or tape just didn't explain enough.  UNTIL NOW!  This is the best pilates book i have seen.  The pictures are great, the step by step instructions are so complete, the breathing instructions are thorough.. and there are very good examples AND PICTURES of 'what not to do!'  I finally feel like I can learn Pilates correctly and really utilize the exercises.  The book also is broken into different routines.  A wonderful job!! Highly reccomended...	2002-08-02

The best advice I have ever been give came from this book.. and that was simply to NOT look at a traditional tarot book for three months.. to just give the psychic muscles a try.  Of course those who study tarot should know the traditional meanings.. but learning to read by memorizing 78 definitions is not only daunting.. but teaches nothings except that you can memorize.  This book shows you how to use Tarot as a tool.. and helps you learn to trust yourself and your own intuition.. It makes reading fun!!! It makes you feel as if you can't make a mistake.. It lets your imagination run wild.. I LOVE it!!!	2002-05-14

From a \\"tarot\\" perspective, this deck strays quite a bit from the traditional.. so much so that some say it would be better called a \\"divinatory deck\\" as opposed to \\"tarot\\".<br />The Majors stray heavily in some cases, using two sets of titles on each card, a title and subtitle.. such as Sky Dancer/Morning Star which is used instead of THE SUN.  The minors use a \\"number + element\\" system.. If you've read books by Gail Fairfield, you know what I am talking about.<br />The book is also very different.  Instead of using keywords, it tells a narrative, or story, for each card.. a good idea in concept.. but the stories just seem to go on and on and on.. I found this getting quite old after the first few cards.<br />Well, all this 'negativity' aside, I have to say the art on this deck is some of the mose beautiful I have ever seen.  I absolutely adore Palin as an artist.  I also love nature and faeries and this deck has a STRONG faerie feeling..<br />I do feel that this is a wonderful deck.. if you aren't looking for \\"traditional\\" and you can get past the book... I think this deck would be PERFECT for the person that reads from intuition.  You can get SO MUCH from these pictures.	2002-05-14

Not only is the artwork beautiful, but it is so peaceful and calming.  The pictures are not overdone, or too busy.  This is a deck where the tougher cards are not really scary.. but at the same time avoid being \\"cute\\" or playing down to the message.. Actually, the death card, \\"Transformation\\" in this deck, is captivating to me.. while still getting the message clearly across.. NOT an easy task. There are keywords on the minor arcana.. some people do not like this.. myself usually included.  However, here, they somehow seem to blend into the overall meaning of the picture without being distracting.  Amazon does not have this deck readily available.. but it is out there.. ...	2002-05-09

For the most part, you don't need a deck specific book to learn to read tarot.  Unless you have a more intricate... or as some might say, \\"oddball\\" deck, most general tarot books will teach you the subject as well as supply traditional interpretations that can be applied to most decks.  <br />Some will even tell you to avoid these type of books.. as it is always best to use your *own* intuition and to discover what the cards mean for *you*.. While I do beleive this is one of the most important parts of learning tarot, I also beleive gaining another's perspective can only help.. It can expand on what you see.. allow you to see something new.. even at times provide that \\"AHA!! NOW I get it\\" feeling... <br />What is special about this book is that it was written by the artist herself.  Who better to provide such insights as the person who's blood, sweat, and tears went into every drawing and symbol. .. the person who lived each card from glimpse to creation.  <br />If you love this deck like I do.. this book will help make it come alive in a whole new way.  If you can't order through this website due to limited availability, Robin sells the book through her own site. ...	2002-05-09

It strays a bit from 'traditional', adding a few additional Major Arcana cards.  Also, this deck likes to be considered somewhat shamanistic, but the true shaman would know better.. <br />That aside, if you are driven more by what speaks to you, as opposed to reviews.. this may be worth checking out.  The art is truly breathtaking... and HIGHLY intuitive.. for that alone, it would be worth buying.. Also, if you like animals, they are plenty (hence the title \\"Shapeshifter\\")..

It is good for the more experienced reader when they get stumped.. or for the beginner to check their accuracy or open up new ideas. BUT..this book is also a sort of 'cliff notes' on tarot.  If you become reliant on this book, as opposed to using it as a reference, you will never really learn tarot.. you will just be good at looking up information.

The whole idea of fairies just excites me.. which is probably why I love these cards.  I think life is so much more interesting and fun when we allow ourselves to beleive in the mystical.  The pictures are just beautiful.  I liked them even better than her Healing with the Angels cards, which were great.

Some of the information seems too basic (like 'playing fortune telling at a party'). Other information is so symbolic that, while important and interesting, it is impossible to relate to life.  This book just CLICKED for me.  The cards finally were presented in a way that became relevant to me - a tool to guide me and others through the ins and outs of life.  Janina has quickly become my favorite author on the subject to date.  I just ordered her other book Tarot for a New Generation.

But, I think a beginner should concentrate on learning the cards with one or two basic spreads before getting crazy.. so I'd reccomend this to someone that has a little experience.
