The overview above clearly indicates this, and I think we did a great job of covering these topics in the book:<br /><br />1) Take on the role of change agent: prepare yourself for the challenge<br /><br />2) Understand the value of ClearCase in your organization and gain consensus for implementing it<br /><br />3) Map your software manufacturing process and plan your deployment<br /><br />4) Model change-management: actors, use cases, and problem domains<br /><br />5) Enforce and automate high-efficiency development policies and processes<br /><br />6) Walk through build and release management: frequency, automation, communication, and more<br /><br />7) Integrate ClearCase with existing tools and systems<br /><br />8) Support efficient, error-free development across geographically dispersed teams<br /><br />9) Plan for ClearCase hardware and size your VOB repository<br /><br />10) Iterate your system to improve efficiency and reduce build- and test-cycle times<br /><br />11) Avoid pitfalls and troubleshoot problems with ClearCase deployments<br /><br />Is there technical material that Admins and engineers will find useful? Definitely. But the bulk of this material is written for the broader team.	2005-03-07

Spencer W. Kimball was a great man and Prophet of God who tackled a very difficult topic. Nobody likes hearing that they have sinned. But what this book points out is that most sin is made up of little things, adding up over time, slowly taking control of our lives until we cannot escape without recognizing what we have become, and changing how we live our lives. This book is not about guilt, and its not about arguing over worldly views of what is right and wrong. Its about humility and Christ-like love. Its a very moving and inspirational read, and I highly recommend it to LDS and non-LDS alike.	2005-01-12

Personally, I am sick of the spin from both sides of the aisle, and appreciate facts backed up by proof. That's exactly what Coulter delivers in this book. If you disagree, go look up the source material. Coulter meticulously covers all of the bases, sometimes even providing the exact search terminology she uses on LexisNexis so the Doubting Thomases of the world can go do some homework.<br /><br />As I read her books, I can hear her voice -- and picture her shredding through Liberals one after another, and usually with their own words come back to haunt them.<br /><br />6 stars out of 5.	2005-01-06

This book helps you to identify what you're passionate about, and how to go about creating a dream business around whatever it is that you enjoy.<br /><br />Romanus takes his years of experience working with literally hundreds of individuals and companies and boils it down to the essentials.<br /><br />This isn't your average business book - it is a series of worksheets and activities to help you define, refine, and act. If you've never owned a business, but have always dreamed of breaking out on your own - this book is for you. If you've been in a startup before, and are thinking about trying it again regardless of your previous success, you'll still find a lot of helpful information to help you avoid the mistakes and pitfalls of too many startups.<br /><br />Also -- if you get a chance, I highly recommend attending one of Romanus' events.

My wife and I are huge fans of the fake investigative reporting....and this book was created for people like me.<br /><br />In high school, someone gave me a copy of a \\"science book\\" that was anything but factual. It claimed the wheel was created by alien life forms visiting our planet, and that an eclipse of the earth occurs when you place your hands over your eyes. The Daily Show book is its companion.<br /><br />I stood in a Borders recently next to an older couple thumbing through a copy, and had to laugh at some of their comments about how wrong and stupid the book was. They were actually reading through it as if it were a serious discourse on political thought in America. Give me a break. The book pokes fun at everything, and takes no political prisoners. Yes, the show's writers lean to the left politically. But they also have the uncanny ability to find the humorous in everything. People need to lighten up and laugh a little.	2004-11-29

But the folks who need this book the most are those who are interested in working for Microsoft itself. Not the major niche the publisher is shooting for, of course, but I'm telling you - this book is a stellar resource for how people work and thrive in the MS culture.

Fortunately (or unfortunately) I was stranded at the airport for 3 days, and was able to digest the entire book. I loved it, and before my flight was finally able to take off, I went back and purchased copies of the first 3 books, as well (because my kids each had their own copies and didn't want to share).  <br /> <br />My favorite book was the 4th, but my wife and kids insist that the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best (my problem is I started with the 4th, which ruined the suspense in the 3rd). But now that I've read all of the books at least once, I can honestly step back and say -- this one is still the best. <br /> <br />It begins with the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup, and doesn't let you loose your grip on the arm of your chair until Harry os rescued from possible death at the hands of Voldemort at the end, only to see one of his classmates perish instead. But its not just the main story that i love about this book - you learn so much more about the surrounding countryside, about life in the wizarding world, and the people around Harry. It's the deepest dive into Rowlings world of any of the books, and I just can't wait for the movie in 2005.	2004-11-24

As my parent's property adjoined a state park, and a large mountain covered in streams and hiking trails was right at my doorstep, it was easy for me to envision myself living this story. Unfortunately, the coastal hills of Northern California did not contain every aspect of this book -- for the life of me, I could not find a single tree big enough to carve out my own little fortress. I loved this story, and read it several times - it inspired many school projects on nature, hikes in search of indigenous and edible plants, and many unsuccessful attempts at building traps for rabbits and birds.<br /><br />And then I forgot about the book for 20+ years, until this summer. I was with my oldest son at the city library, who just became a Webelo Scout, and we were looking for books about nature and camping and such - when suddenly I remembered the story, and found the book on the shelf. Of course, my son's reaction was predictable: any book that Dad was so enthusiastic about could not possibly be worth reading. So I did the Dad thing and told him to read two chapters, and if he didn't like it, I'd give him $5. He took the bait, and forgot all about the bribe. He absolutely loved it.<br /><br />What more do you need to know about this book?	2004-11-23

He is the seventh son, which in this world gives him special abilities. As with most of OSC's stories, there is a dark side to Alvin's life - a constant pursuit by an evil power that he calls the Unmaker, which causes the death of his oldest brother just as Alvin is born. This is a world where some people have a \\"knack\\" or special powers, and nothing keep evil away like a good old hex on your front porch and above your window. And no matter how much good Alvin does with his life, the Unmaker is always there, tearing things down, laying snares, inspiring evil men to do evil deeds.<br /><br />Its a fascinating story, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the entire series. OSC does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat.	2004-11-23

As a huge OSC fan, I first read a couple of his short stories through a comparative literature class, and was fascinated by his style...and his ability to draw you in quickly to each of his characters.

The book was on the preferred reading list for new students, and so I picked up a copy without knowing anything about it. For those who may have read a \\"modern English\\" version of this classic, I'd say go back and read it again in its original form. I've read both, and I prefer the book the way it was written and published in 1678. It reads somewhat like a script, with sections beginning with the name of the person talking, and a constant barrage of characters coming and going.<br /><br />The book begins with an apology from the author in the form of prose - John Bunyan was a very humble man who spent years in prison for his religious beliefs. My copy also includes a fascimile of the orginal title page from the first edition. The story follows the life of a man named Christian and his travels through the world, trying to find the Celestial city and have the burden on his back removed. As with everything in this story, there is no hiding the truth about who the characters are and what they want with the protagonist - all of the names are quite literal in their descriptions of the characters. For example, he encounters people named Piety, Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. And throughout the story, his burden is literally a heavy weight on his back.<br /><br />The book has two section, both written in the similitude of a dream. The language is rich and beautiful (which is why I recommend the un-modified version), and sends a message of faith and optimism. I highly recommend it.	2004-11-20

Its just an entirely different experience reading through the text, and its closer to how it was originally published. This is an incredible book, translated through the power of God, that tells plain and simple truths about the purpose of man, our relationship to God, and the divinity of Christ.<br /><br />One of the ways the BoM teaches is through repetition - you can see how the cycle of sin repeats itself: wickedness and destruction -&#62; humility -&#62; acceptance of gospel principles -&#62; people are happy -&#62; wealth and power increase -&#62; pride and sin -&#62; wickedness and destruction. Through these examples I have been able to correct things in my own life, and the book is a constant comfort when I have questions.<br /><br />Whether or not you believe in the manner in which the BoM came into existence, it is worth reading...and learning for yourself. Also worht noting -- take a look at most of the people writing negative reviews on here, and you'll see that their harsh words on the BoM is typically their ONLY review. A couple people I looked at have even taken the time to attack multiple Mormom books. How telling.	2004-11-20

It contains many online articles and personal essays that mainstream readers may not have seen before. And as with all of her writings, Ann has painstakingly included more facts and figures than seems humanly possible.<br /><br />when faced with these kinds of facts, most liberals would flee rather than refute. If you're sitting on the fence politically, be warned that this book - and all of Ann's works - could be overwhelming.<br /><br />Compared to her other books, this one is just a smoother read - you get the information, the brilliant and witty enlightenment of liberal squalor, and the stoutly conservative opinion of Ms. Coulter without gagging on the dryness of the data behind the scenes.	2004-11-19

When I first read Lost Boys, for some reason I saw many similarities with his book Lovelock, co-authored by Kathy Kidd. But you could make the same argument for Ender's Game. In many of his stories, you have this tragic hero, and at the end of each you have overwhelming loss...with a little bit of light. And yet that flicker of light is strong enough to stand against the darkness of the loss. That is how this book made me feel - that underneath everything that goes amiss in your life, there is still that spark of light.<br /><br />So what is the book actually about? Originally written as if was Card's own family story, its about a neighborhood murderer, and how their son tries to help the young victims. There really isn't a happy ending here, folks -- its a clear departure from his previous works, and its my understanding that this book is one of the first in a line of stories created with the intent of being made into film. This would definitely make a good movie - something with a Silence of the Lambs feel, though.	2004-11-18

Brigham Young pulled the book off the shelf for a time because people were referring to it for a while as scripture, which it was not. The leadership wanted to make sure the dates and activities that were recorded, since they were coming from her memory - not from her diaries - were correct. This book is a spoken history, recorded by an assistant, not direct from her diaries. When the dates and stories were later confirmed, the manuscript was released again for publication. Where there are differences in dates and names (not many), the differences are noted. There are NO differences in the facts of these stories with official church doctrine. So to imply that there is some great difference between versions is ridiculous. Period.<br /><br />Reading Lucy Mack Smith's first-hand account of the trials and tribulations of the Smith family was a great reminder of the importance of family sticking together. I read bits and pieces out of my sister's copy for a few weeks, and finally broke down and got my own copy so that I could read it end to end. Mother Smith's account provides some important spiritual insight that you just won't get in the typical historical books of the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Her writings capture the urgency of the work, and the constant movements of a family repeatedly persecuted and driven from their home by mobs. It's just a wonderful book.	2004-11-17

The story follows the life of Bean, the smaller, younger boy who in some small ways Ender realized was possibly the superior soldier.

To be honest, I wasn't too keen on reading a spin on the classic fairytale....but was very pleased with the depth of this story. Card is by far my favorite author, and this is yet another demonstration of how he can take a familiar theme and breathe new life into it. He intricately weaves this story of Sleeping Beauty into it roots in Ukranian folklore, leading the reader to believe that maybe there's some truth to the fairytale. All around excellent read.	2004-11-11

It really is a fascinating read, although sometimes dark and a little graphic -- but it would make an excellent sci-fi movie. The hero of the story is a rad-regen, meaning his family has the ability to regenerate body parts (if a finger is cut off, it grows back), however he cannot control his growth as puberty hits, and he has extra limbs and internals growing all over the place. Talk about a bad day. He becomes an outcast, and wanders this planet of outcasts  looking for purpose and a future. The ancestors of the planet's inhabitants were outcasts from earth, sent here for their crimes - the planet has no natural resources for them to escape - and hence is called Planet Treason.<br /><br />A great adventure, and a fun read.

Broken into three sections, these masterful stories begin with the Day of Pain, in which a world that never knew physical or mental pain -- due to the watchful eyes of a powerful race of mutants -- is suddenly left unprotected. As the people of this planet come to grips with their new reality, they are visited by the man (Jason Worthing) who caused the Day of Pain - a man who has slept for thousands of years while his offspring developed their strange powers and began watching the world, removing pain. The second section visits the world where Jason Worthing was born, and tells why he left it. The third section takes place while Jason sleeps at the bottom of the ocean, and is an account of the trials his descendants go through, coping with the powers that make them different - and separate from the rest of thr world. All in all a fantastic story, and a highly recommended book!	2004-11-11

John and Kyle made the same mistakes that many entrepreneurs thankfully make - they followed their passion instead of their senses, and didn't buckle under the pressure and the unknown. One other valuable lesson from this book -- document your process. This is a great way to share your successes and your mistakes with others. I wish we had more stories like this when I was working on my MBA - something more than the dry, non-applicable case studies stuck in front of us. And John and Kyle also provided one other important gem: how to save a few bucks a month at the neighborhood gym. Thanks guys.	2004-11-10

Mr. Steele attempts to write a guideline for managing technology from the perspective of the mid-level manager, from  innovation through integration. The book is dry, and not really positioned for the individual entrepreneur - its more of a large company mid-managed type book.<br />Remember in the movie 'Dead Poets Society' how they had to read a book on how to appreciate poetry, and it was very militaristic and tedious?

OK, instead of wadting my time with a long-winded book report, I'll cut to the chase: while nearly 90 pages long, this book is fast-paced and engaging, and keeps you turning the pages. One of the great things about Rowling is how she adapts Harry to the personality quirks that come with the age group. He's a teen, so now he's edgy and cranky -- and instead of just going to ask for help, he is holding things in more. Typical teenager, and it all works into the story.

Langguth articulately and thoroughly weaves the stories of Otis, the Adams cousins, Jefferson, Franklin, Hancock, Washington, and others together into a compelling read that is difficult to put down. I never realized how intertwined some of their actions were, and how their actions inspried each other, driving the whole process forward to independence.<br />If you are a fan of the stories of the revolutionary war, I highly recommend this book.	2003-04-01
