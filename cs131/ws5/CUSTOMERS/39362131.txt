Cannon, Writings and Speeches, 1932-34	Books	5	0	0	N	N	revolutionary politics in the 1930s	This volume of Socialist Workers Party leader James P. Cannon?s writings is dated to a tumultuous time.  The Stalinized Communist International, and the German Communist Party, refused to wage an effective struggle against the rise of Hitler to power, causing a defeat felt by workers and farmers around the globe.  This defeat was as unnecessary as it was massive.  This caused not a whimper of protest within that movement.  Communists who defended the traditions of the Communist International of Lenin?s time, led by Leon Trotsky, became convinced that the official Communist movement had now become an obstacle, not an opportunity, for world revolution.  They moved to gather their forces into a new revolutionary movement.  In doing so, they also searched for, and found, groups of revolutionary-minded workers from other backgrounds, who themselves had been deeply affected by the political and economic turmoil of the 1930s.	2002-10-26

But these capitalists could only overthrow the slaveowners by allying themselves with small farmers and, most importantly, with the slaves themselves.  Camejo tells the story of the struggles of these freed slaves.  They were the key factor in the Union?s victory, and continued their fight for freedom in its aftermath.  The initial post-slavery governments in the South reflected the revolutionary power of the freed people.  They saw some of the broadest democratic reforms in American history in education, civil liberties, and many other fields.  But the ruling northern capitalists turned back the freed slaves? struggles for a genuine land reform and for armed self-defense.  The Republican establishment set the ground for a new and bizarre form of white supremacy:  the vile Jim Crow system, which kept the descendents of slaves in a form of legal inequality for three quarters of a century.  This book is an irreplaceable guide to this crucial period of U.S. history.	2002-10-13

To answer this question, you have to begin with the origins of these wars.  If you think war comes from misunderstanding, or venial politicians, then you?d think international agreements could turn down the threats.  Brian Grogan, a leader of Britain's Communist League, argues differently in this 1983 article.  Conflicts among capitalist nations, and hostility to anticapitalist and anticolonial revolutions, come from the very nature of the imperialist system, and the direction of our fire has to be aimed at its source.  This volume also contains two articles on the development of what socialists have called ?the aristocracy of labor?, a narrow, privileged section of the working class that serves as a base of support for the union bureaucracy and the capitalist system it supports.	2002-09-29

They were social movements in the broadest sense.  They led powerful strike mobilizations, galvanizing the hopes of not merely their own members, but other workers, the unemployed, family farmers, and others.   By the 1950s, U.S. union structures had become a prop of capitalism, both domestically and internationally, ruled by officialdom as corrupt and disloyal to workers as can be found on any corporate board.  How did the fighting unions become their opposite?  Farrell Dobbs, a Minneapolis Teamster and leader of the famed 1934 Minneapolis general strike, and later of the Socialist Workers Party, describes how the militancy of his union was confronted, and smashed, in the prelude and opening of World War II.  He also explains the lessons to be learned by today?s militant workers.	2002-09-29

What is the relationship between mind and matter?  Is there any spirit that creates or changes the world at will?  These questions are as old as human society itself.  George Novack traces the evolution of materialist thought, and its opposite, idealism through ancient Greek and Roman society.  He explains why the rise of the Roman slave empire, and the later establishment of Christian orthodoxy, crippled the development of both materialism and scientific discovery in Europe for some 1,200 years.  He contrasts the earliest forms of materialism with the rationalism of the Enlightenment and the dialectical materialism codified by Marx and Engels.	2002-08-16

It explains the rise of fascist perspectives, such as those of Patrick Buchanan and Jean-Marie Le Pen, as the inevitable product of the social crisis that is unfolding.

This volume records a debate that reached back to the earliest years of the Cuban revolution.  After taking the economic resources of society out of the hands of the capitalists, how can toilers use their power to refashion their world?  Some advocated basing themselves on the model of the Soviet Union, with its emphasis on material incentives and administration.  Others, including Che Guevara, said socialism can only be built by raising the participation, and political consciousness of workers and farmers, with planning straining to be based on creating new values of human need, and fighting the individualism and greed inherited from capitalism.  The importance of this debate, which continues in Cuba today, can be seen in the corruption and collapse of the Soviet model in the USSR and Eastern Europe, and the continuing vitality of the Cuban workers state.	2002-08-16

The FSLN led a massive mobilization that uprooted the long-standing Somoza system of repression and subservience to U.S. capitalism.  The armed people began a road of social justice and genuine sovereignty.  Led by the Sandinistas, they defeated the invasion of counterrevolutionary contras -- armed and commanded by Washington.  Yet the FSLN, at the moment of its greatest victories, turned away from the road of leading the workers and peasants forward to the overturn of capitalism.  Instead, they reversed course and abandoned land reform, workers rights, and sought to become an inoffensive bourgeois political party.  Even that modest ambition was thwarted, and they lost power in 1990.	2002-08-16

The original article joked about the declining use of cosmetics and subsequent problems of the cosmetics industry.  A reader's reaction quickly brought a discussion of the role of women in society, their increasing participation in the workforce, and the source of the imaging of women in culture.<BR> This dispute, which became a debate within the Socialist Workers Party, took place well before the rise of the 1960s women's liberation movement.

He joined the battle against the vicious and corrupt Batista dictatorship, and the social and economic system it defended.  In doing so, he joined the struggle of sugar refinery workers and met the militants of Fidel Castro's Rebel Army.

Leon Trotsky argues no.  The rise to power of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco was a result of the regular workings of the capitalist system and the failure of the workers and farmers of their countries to wage an effective fight to replace it.  Trotsky, a leader of the Russian revolution who was exiled, and later murdered by Joseph Stalin, denounces the failure of both the class-collaborationist Social Democracy and the sectarian and corrupt Communist Party to rise to the task. <BR>     Trotsky de-mystifies the hold that fascist ideology gained over masses of desperate middle-class elements in these countries, and the decisive support given to these movements by the biggest capitalists of their time.
