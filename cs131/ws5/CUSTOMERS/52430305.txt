Neave escaped from Colditz which he wrote about in \\"They Have Their Exits\\". He was then recruited by the secret services to manage escape organizations / routes in occupied territories, which is in his book \\"Saturday at M.I.9\\". After the war Neave coordinated part of the Nuremburg Nazi war criminal trials (his book \\"Nuremburg\\"). <br /> <br />Paul Routledge has written an interesting biography of Airey Neave, from his early life in college, WWII experiences, and then his political life. Neave was key in the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher. As a reward he took over the post of managing the Irish troubles. Neave favored putting down the IRA ruthlessly, and was assassinated in a car bombing before he could try it.	2005-08-24

The book chronicles the history of several escape lines to Britain (principally used by downed airmen), most of which ended in the arrest of the principles and many other people by the Gestapo, with torture and execution typically following, if not a sentence to a concentration camp. The resistance did this work at great risk as their sense of duty to the war effort, or their way to fight the Nazis. The escape lines were typically broken up by traitors in the employ of the Gestapo who posed as escaping Allied airmen. Neave documents the actions of the most hated traitors and what happened to them in the end.<br />There is a bibliography of 10 sources, and this book has probably 10 more references to other books on the same subject in the footnotes (which look great!).<br />Note: I think this book first appeared under the title \\"Escape Room\\" in 1969. My edition of \\"Saturday\\" is a paperback published in 1989. I bought Escape Room in hard back form. It has lots of pictures and some maps, whereas \\"Saturday\\" does not.

Jan Baalsrud was a WWII Norwegian commando trained in Britain for a special sabotage mission in Norway. The mission was preempted by the Germans, and all the commandos were executed except Jan who got away with his big toe shot off. To be caught was a death sentence, and civilians could only help him under penalty of death. Without proper clothing or footware, he waded through icy water, snow and an avalanche for many days with occasional help along the way. For the second half of the journey Jan was too ill to walk and was conveyed by underground members. Frost bite took all his toes, which he cut off himself. He finally made it to a hospital in Sweden.<br />The ever present cold and Jan's seemingly unending journey while freezing most of the time makes me question if I've ever had any discomfort worthy of the name. The book is well documented with 5 pages of sources.	2002-12-25

The main theme of the book is doing underground operations while having constant above board dealings with the enemy. The writing style is very readable, although I got lost a little when references were made to various towns.<br />It starts with Andre being in manufacturing in support of the war effort, and a description of the German invasion as seen locally. There was a German anti-aircraft installation near where he lived which shot down several Allied planes throughout the war. Andre gets involved with the Underground when he decides to harbor some evading airmen. This involvement was not thrust upon him, he seeked it out. As his activities became known to people in the area, many of whom were sympathetic to the Allies, he became more involved with harboring downed airmen. He also became involved with the Passive Defense, an above ground French organization that did what they could to fight fires, discourage French and German looters, etc. While patrolling the town for the Passive Defense, they would simultaneously participate in Resistance functions like putting nails on the road at night to sabotage German vehicles and removing the nails in the morning. The looting and sabotage intensified during the chaos of the Allied Normandy invasion.  The most violent thing he did in the book was to set a German truck on fire. I get the feeling that Andre may have participated in some violent acts but did not include them in the book.<br />In 1944 he was fingered by informers and arrested by the Gestapo, who beat him up very badly. The Gestapo gathered up other suspected Resistance members, and sent them together to the Buchenwald concentration camp. He and another prisoner were able to escape during a bomb raid while being transfered to another camp, and after a couple of weeks made contact with the Allied front.<br />I wish there had been more follow up on what became of the participants in the book after the war, and especially what became of the informants and collaborators. Maybe a later edition could add an appendix dealing with this.	2001-11-04

The book has a fairly fast pace but also has a lot of detail. The first three stories deal with downed flyers in France and Belgium who eventually made it to Spain and then British held Gibraltar. Spain was sympathetic to Germany, and treated evaders harshly until 1943 when it became politically necessary for them to develop a better relationship with the Allies.<br />The fourth story is of a later evader in Belgium who was able to meet the oncoming Allies in 1944 instead of going to Spain. The fifth story details the evasion of an entire bomber crew from the island of Corfu over to Albania. They stayed at a guerilla camp in the mountains and eventually escaped by ship to Italy after much hardship. The final story is of of a flyer who evaded through Italy. Originally captured by the Germans upon landing, he was released from jail with many others when Italy signed an armistice with the allies. He spent the rest of his time evading the Germans and travelling around Italy (with much help from Italian partisans) and finally escaping to the Allied lines after many setbacks.<br />One of the central themes of the book is the sacrifice made by the occupied population to feed and help the Allied fliers escape. Every story has a follow-up at the end about the later life of the evader and what happened to the people that helped them evade (if known).	2001-10-31

Side bars are frequent and often pointless. The book starts out with the author arriving in Nam for his second tour, then goes into a flashback of the first tour that lasts a third of the book, without telling what's going on. There are very few dates and no maps. There is not near as much action as most of the popular Viet Nam books, and the story is largely one of the author's frustration at not being allowed to command a combat team for more than a couple operations. The book may be of value for its unique content about Montagnard advisors before regular troops arrived, and the author certainly speaks from the heart.	2001-10-11

However, it then got better with the saga of Hartmann's air battles. His strategy was to spot the enemy first and surprise them, waiting to fire until very close, which typically resulted in catastrophic damage to the enemy plane. The second half of the book is about Hartmann's captivity, and is especially interesting. The description of the rape and murder of German civilians by the conquering Russian army was enlightening and serves as a warning to future generations. Hartmann was then a prisoner for 10 years, subject to psychotic mind games of the Russian NKVD. The authors give some interesting psychological analysis of the prison situation. It's a good read and thought provoking.	2001-06-17

Most of the writing is made up of memory snapshots of the author and what is going on inside his head, kind of surreal. The author is involved with networking with other veterans, including American Vietnam veterans, and he is trying to help himself and other vets deal with the psychological trauma from the war, and that's what the book is really about. It serves that purpose well. It is not a typical eye-witness account of battle, and would appear very disjointed from that perspective; the book has virtually no analysis of the war or explanations of strategy and tactics.	2001-06-03

He first gets posted to a defensive position without a lot of action, although it was nerve racking for him (and a boring 100 pages).  Things warm up when he fights a retreat from the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. After that, he attacks until the end of the war from Belgium through Germany to Czechoslovakia. The author always states where each platoon is, the lay of the ground, what was going through his mind at the time, what time they moved out, the risks involved, etc. - very thorough. As normal with a company commander, he is not usually at the forefront of the battle, but a couple hundred yards (?) back where he can control the platoons. I found several things interesting in the drive through Germany - the reaction of pro-allies populations, how they commandeered German houses to stay in at each town, more Germans surrendering as they went on, and the feelings of the soldiers as the outcome of the war became obvious. I'd give the second half of the book a 5.	2001-05-31

I can think of two things which would have made this book better, which I have seen in other first person accounts: 1) Continuity - the narrative is split into small stories, instead of flowing. 2) Books which deal with Special Forces or their helicopter support seem the most exciting, and the men seemed to have a tighter friendship which makes me empathize with them. The author mentions there were pilots who continually volunteered for LRRP missions.<br />One unique and interesting thing in this book was an account about the author's 1993 return to Vietnam.

It is a thick, exhaustive tome of scholarly research which details the main events of 14th century Western Europe and England.  The main themes are 1) the corruption of the nobles and the Church, 2) the wars of England upon France, and the soldiers who subsequently became mercenaries who continued to ravage France, and 3) the Black Death, which wiped out about half the population of Europe in succeeding waves over 50 years. The description of the populace's reaction to the plague was particularly interesting - people at first thought it was a scourge from God and the end of the world was at hand.

It is not a riveting, blood-and-guts account.  Rather it is the autobiography of a German commander, centering on World War II, with a broad rather than detailed view of the action.  Some maps would have been helpful. Writing as an eye-witness, the author shares the details of his personal life during the war, and makes an emotional impact on the reader. Of particular novelty, and a little hard to credit, were the references to being &quot;fair&quot; in war.  This included a &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; for cessation of hostilities promptly at 5:00 p.m. by both sides in Africa, and calling each other on the radio to ask about missing patrols. Luck also discusses that halfway through the war, many of the commanders felt they were going to lose because of lack of equipment and supplies, and I got the impression that attacking the Russians was a fatally excessive commitment of resources.  It is hard to imagine how they kept up their morale as both fronts were being pushed back. The account of how Luck persevered in the Russian work camp makes me respect him. Since the end of his captivity in 1950 the author made a career for himself, and also has become a sought after lecturer for historical groups interested in the war in Normandy, and has made many friends among the Allied veterans.	2000-12-17

The book is a modestly written, eye witness account. This is a classic, and I'm glad to see it back in print, as it was originally published in 1952.	2000-12-01

(a battle cry) covers a paratrooper's training and 7 days of intense combat in the Normandy invasion. The battle starts by parachuting from a plane a couple hundred feet off the ground, barely high enough for the parachute to open (many others' did not open in time). Dropped about 12 miles from the intended location, the paratroopers gathered in small groups and moved towards the sound of battle. Often with no officers present, they launched themselves at superior forces. This is a fast paced book, with very graphic descriptions of submachine gun and grendade fighting - a great eye-witness account.	2000-11-26

Chickenhawk details the mass use of helicopters for delivering and retrieving troops in major assaults.  It's also interesting as the author is not convinced the war is just.  He routinely sees death and sometimes freak accidents, and slowly goes crazy from the stress.	2000-10-24

He was in and out of trouble with his superiors, but was respected by his fellow soldiers.  He worked extensively with the indigenous people and learned their languages, with his most memorable service being in the Phoenix program run by the CIA, where it appears they had a very high ratio of successful missions eliminating VC operatives.	2000-10-18

First, it doesn't contain much new information - the stories behind the songs are pretty general, and not interviews of Led Zeppelin.  Secondly, the author says negative stuff about  the music. For example: &quot;There never was a real ending to 'Whole Lotta  Love' and maybe it should have finished a chorus earlier than the final  fade-out.&quot; Then on &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; he says &quot;It  fades out in some chaos, which might suggest it was a trial run for a song  weeded out of the final album-selection process&quot;. Thankfully Led Zepp  didn't listen to people like this guy when they made their recordings.	1999-12-24
