It's really a Marco Polo travel diary for today. Burkett provides needed background to world events, in a lively personal style. Fun to read, and you can think about it afterwards, too. The book recounts Burkett's adventures in Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Russia, Burma (officially Myanmar), China, Vietnam, and Cambodia during the 2001-2002 events, when she was a Fulbright Scholar. I agree with her view that the Fulbright program is one US government initiative that really works as it was intended. She explains how her view of the world changed after her experience teaching abroad in the wake of 9/11--just the kind of growth experience Senator Fulbright wanted.  Burkett has a real gift for noticing the interesting detail. Her description of the little things at her university in Bishkek--such as wandering around the hall trying to find a classroom after being kicked out for some sort of seminar--tracked pretty exactly to my experience at UWED in Tashkent (which I was pleased to see she called the Harvard of Central Asia). Burkett's observations are generally acute, the most telling ones based on her personal confrontations with age-old traditions. <br /> <br />Most of all, I enjoyed Burkett's Kyrgyz anecdotes, which I think reflect a certain mentality--and reality--in the region. Here's a sample: <br /> <br />While walking in the countryside, two Uzbeks and two Kyrgyz fell in a hole. \\"I'll give you a hand up,\\" the younger Uzbek said to the older. \\"Then, when you're on solid ground, you can pull me up.\\" The older man agreed, the Uzbeks freed themselves and then went on their way. <br />The two Kyrgyz men looked at each other grimly, and one began climbing out of the hole on his own. \\"Hey, you can't do that,\\" yelled the other man, pulling on his companion's legs. \\"If you get out, I'll be alone and stranded.\\"	2005-05-03

Because Sharansky notes that his mentor, Andrei Sakharov, called for changing the fear society of the USSR to a freedom society (Sharansky's terms) in order to compete with the West in a comptetitive race to the future. That is, the USSR and the USA shared the same Western enlightenment goals of human progress, scientific and technological development, and education. The prestige enjoyed by scientists and academicians in the former USSR gave Sakharov the status to make his views widely known -- Sharansky had also studied physics. Thus, the USSR and USA were ostensibly headed towards the same end, just by different means. In the case of the USA the means required freedom, in the case of the USSR the means required fear. Dissidents in the USSR shared the same goals as their American adversaries. <br /> <br />This is not true of some anti-American dissidents in unfree societies today. <br /> <br />Sharanky describes his prison life with harrowing accuracy, and what really sticks out is that Sharansky describes his fellow inmates, whether Russian Orthodox, nationalists, democrats, or Jewish refuseniks as committed to non-violence, tolerance, and other values even Voltaire would understand and support. That is, supporting Russian dissidents meant supporting allies of freedom and democracy. <br /> <br />When it comes to Israel, Sharansky does an excellent job of describing the hostility of the \\"Human Rights\\" NGOs to the Jewish state. And he talks at length about the importance of ending the fear societies in the Arab world, for the sake of their Arab populations. He says the West should champion oppressed Arab advocates of freedom societies. No argument there. <br /> <br />But there is something important missing from the book--and from Perle, Ledeen, et al. when they talk about supporting democracy.  <br /> <br />What is to be done with those opponents of the fear societies who don't want freedom societies, who don't want progress, who don't value science, who don't believe in tolerance? What is to be done with those, who under the cover of \\"democracy\\" are actually advocating tyranny--who want to turn back the clock to the Middle Ages? That is, Islamist extremists who are poised to exploit \\"democracy-building\\" projects?  <br /> <br />For example, what should Russia do about Chechnya? Sharansky does not discuss this. Yet it was the Chechen crisis that caused the collapse of the liberal democratic consensus in Russian politics. Given a choice between security and democracy, the population chose security--because \\"democracy\\" led to an Islamist extremist rogue state, governed by Sha'aria, tield to the Taliban and Bin Laden, that practiced kidnapping, drug-dealing, and oppression--and then launched attacks on neighboring Russian lands. <br /> <br />If an independent Chechnya turned into a disaster, eventually leading to the Second Chechen War, what might prevent a new state of Palestine from following that dismal path? <br /> <br />So, while convinced in principle that America should support democracy, helping those who seek to build a freedom society rather than a fear society, I think Sharansky and his advocates need to better work out some distinctions between those who are truly commited to democracy -- including the protection of minorities -- and those who might use it as a tactic toward seizing power, making matters worse than they are today.  <br /> <br />Sharansky is well worth reading. The book is well-written and thought-provoking. But it marks the beginning of a discussion, not the end.	2005-04-06

There's so much in it, on a variety of different levels, it is difficult to capture in a paragraph. Bottom line: The book is a response to a number of philosophical arguments, ranging from Foucault to Fukuyama. Levy takes his personal transformation, comparing himself to, and distinguishing himsef from, Benny Levy in the Bangladesh civil war and May 68 events in Paris, as well as personal confessions from BHL travelling to hot spots today, such as Sri Lanka, to make a number of points:<br />*No single philosophical or political system can cope with the problems of war and evil, they are permanent features of human existence which must be confronted constantly.<br />*History does not &quot;end.&quot; And the smaller and more remote regions are even more affected by it than the central powers.<br />*Islam is not the only movement that spawns terrorists and suicide bombers. There are fanatics and mass murderers wherever one looks for them, from Burundi, to Sri Lanka, to Rwanda, to Sudan--and his chapter on Sudan, written years ago, is particularly relevant today.<br />The style is intensely personal and stream of consciousness. But combining journalism with philosophy is pretty interesting reading--BHL's references to Malraux seem appropriate. <br />War, Evil, and the End of History combines theoretical reflection with striking descriptions of some forgotten messy realities. It is a good reminder that there are lots of loose ends out there, that politics is not the answer to everything, that academic writing removed from the facts of life has some shortcomings. It is also an antidote to the triumphalism of the &quot;End of History&quot; school, that briefly mutated into &quot;Unipolar world&quot; advocacy. This book shows us that facts and actual lived human experience are every bit as important as theoretical paradigms.<br />Fascinating, and challenging. Put War, Evil, and the End of History on your summer reading list.	2004-07-07

Peter Bergson (pen-name of Hillel Kook, nephew of Israel's chief rabbi during WWII) was one of the heroes of the Second World War. His efforts to rescue European Jews  were instrumental in changing American policies; they led to the saving of hundreds of thousands of lives--and possibly to the establishment of Israel (there were only some 700,000 Palestinian Jews in 1948, many of them camp survivors). More famous rescuers, such as Raoul Wallenberg, were able to act in Europe because Bergson had conviced the Roosevelt administration to set up the War Refugee Board in 1944. Before Bergson's work, saving Jews was simply not a priority for the US government. After Bergson succeeded in persuading FDR and Congress, it became a war aim. American agents were active in Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey, among other places, making serious efforts to save lives. David Wyman deserves great praise for putting together previously unpublished documentation in a fascinating book. I only wish the cover had Bergson's photo on it. A must-read for anyone interested in the history of America and the Holocaust.	2004-05-02

What Bernard Henri Levy does so well is to combine his interior monologue, his diaristic stream of consciousness, the appreciation of small details, little perceptions,  with a larger journalistic expose, a &quot;j'accuse&quot; directed against the powers that be, and in the end, a very personal posthumous tribute to someone he never met--someone who BHL mythologizes, in fact, to give meaning to a life lost young. <br />It is indeed possible that Daniel Pearl was not investigating what BHL has exposed in this book, that Pearl really was just an unwitting victim carelessly caught in a trap, and killed for who we was, rather than what he was doing. <br />But by &quot;imagining&quot; Pearl's story BHL has found the perfect device for travelling layer by layer through the various worlds, the circles within circles that make up international terrorism--for the book is really a portrait of his killer, Sheik Omar, not Pearl at all. <br />It is in a sense a perfectly wrought book, an immediate literary classic, penned by a genuine French man of letters, a philosophical provocation and a journalistic coup. It is several books in one, operating at numerous levels of meaning, perhaps the best book of 2003, certainly among the most important.	2003-09-24

An interesting book, not least because Meg Greenfield's WASHINGTON teasingly promises more than it delivers, only hinting at the devastating expose that might have been. One wonders what information may have been in the many secretly coded files that Michael Beschloss edited into the finished manuscript. Did Greenfield name some names that Beschloss deleted? Did she tell some tales that he thought were better left untold? Unfortunately, Beschloss's essay doesn't give a clue. And neither does Katherine Graham's tribute.<br />What does come across clearly from the published work is that Greenfield knew many more secrets than she ever told, that she kept these secrets while working for Max Ascoli at The Reporter and Katherine Graham at the Washington Post, and that she may have taken some of her best stories with her to her grave. <br />One conclusion that occurs after reading WASHINGTON is that reporters and editors have a lot more information than they ever share with their readers -- and that the game of &quot;I know something you don't know&quot; is one of the favorite pastimes in our nation's capital.<br />To see that confession in print, Greenfield's book is well worth reading.	2001-09-03

For anyone who wants to know what went wrong with the National Endowment for the Arts, an excellent start can be found in Jane Alexander's memoir of her term as Chairman.  <br />Without blinking, the author reveals a deep  hostility and contempt towards anyone who dares to point out that the  proverbial emperor (or in this case empress) might not be appropriately  dressed. <br />How fascinating it is to read what Ms. Alexander was thinking  while running the arts agency during a period of intense controversy.  And  what she was thinking about was politics and money rather than art. <br />Her  confrontations with pundits, congressmen, and even the President of the  United States are absolutely worth the price of the book (no doubt one  reason that it graced the cover of the Washington Post Magazine).  <br />Democrats are not spared.  For example, Ms. Alexander describes the  President as a hick from Hot Springs who prefers Elvis Presley to Karen  Finley, since he told her that the American people could not be expected to  pay for such stuff. And Ms. Alexander found herself rather unimpressed with  the artistic level found in Arkansas during a visit to a cultural center in  the President's home town.<br />Curiously, she nevertheless complains that he  stopped hugging her soon after she took over the agency.<br />Now that she has  returned to New York, Ms. Alexander lets everyone in Washington know what  she really thought of them.  In the telling, Ms. Alexander has painted a  devastating self-portrait, expressed with gusto.	2000-06-05

James Ledbetter's concerns are those of a man of the left, and his book reveals a sense of betrayal. He shows how PBS and its insiders used  an original left constituency in pursuit of political power and financial gain. Dropped once PBS became an established institution were the unions, performers and artists, educators and other nonconformists to whom the promise of a refuge for individualism and dissidence had been made by what turned out to be -- not surprisingly to libertarian critics -- another self-serving government bureaucracy motivated by the aggrandizement of power and wealth. I.F. Stone said &quot;all governments are liars&quot; and Ledbetter seems to include PBS in that judgement.  He reveals why some of those who once believed in PBS no longer are able to offer it unconditional support. While non-leftists may not share his vision of a subsidized agitprop network to replace the present system, many of his criticisms of existing problems within PBS are on the mark.	1998-06-12

It is a shame that Dinesh D'Souza did not continue his investigations into political correctness in the University. Unfortunately, since this book was first published, nothing has changed. I read this while completing my Ph.D. It rang true then, and still does.	1998-06-12

This is one of my favorite books. I have read and re-read it again and again. Jane Jacobs explains why governments do good things -- and bad things. And why the free market does good things -- and bad things. Her exposition of the conflict between the &quot;commercial syndrome&quot; and the &quot;guardian syndrome&quot; is profound and original. An exceptionally brilliant philosophical dialog in the tradition of the Greeks.	1998-06-12
