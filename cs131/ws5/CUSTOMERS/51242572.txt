My first book on Photoshop was one of Scott Kelby's Down and Dirty books. And while it didn't teach me an awful lot about the inner workings of Photoshop, it did get me hooked with a lot really quick and simple \\"wow, I made this\\" experiences.<br /><br />Today I revisited Scott Kelby in the shape of his Photoshop Classic Effects. I must say that was a bit of a disappointment. Not only was there absolutely nothing to learn for this Photoshop user, but the tutorials were more or less updated versions of the old ones in my Down & Dirty book. I suspect Scott Kelby only has this same set of tutorials/effects and more or less reuse them in each of his books. I for one, already have my Scott Kelby book, so I will stay clear of his stuff in the future. It goes without saying that none of these effects are terribly new, or couldn't be found elsewhere on Photoshop tutorial sites on the net.<br /><br />If you are a brand new to Photoshop or anything below intermediate user, this is still a good book to get, granted the above caveat. Do however realise that it is heavily slanted towards the kinds of work you'd do in advertising, and Photoshop is used in so many other avenues, but if that is your game, then it is a fine book.	2005-01-21

I was beginning to think that we'd never get a book on games art written by a true veteran. I suppose they are all to busy. But here it is. In truth I have not been so psyched up about, and felt so rewarded by an art book since Owen Demers brilliant texturing book.<br /><br />Matthew takes the reader through all the nooks and crannies of creating art for games, from games interfaces, blocking out levels to alpha masks for textures and normal maps. The funny thing is, it is not an endless line of tutorials to show how its done, but at the end of it, you still feel, when you see the cutting edge art out there in games, 'yeah, I know how that is done.' All you need then is talent and perspiration.<br /><br />The book illustrates every technique with in depth examples in both Maya and 3ds Max side by side. Another great feature. I know you hear those marketing cliches of \\"If you are only gonna buy one book on XX, then...\\" every day, but if you want games art and how its done, then THIS IS THAT BOOK.	2004-11-20

This is a decent book for just browsing through gorgeous images from games or the concept art behind them, but for a practising artist, it is probably more interesting to get nuggets of wisdom from the artists responsible. Don't expect any tutorials, wireframes, WIP shots and the like, but none the less there is interesting information in those interviews, which might just teach you a few new tricks or give you a few ideas for your own work.

Let me first tell that I am from the games industry, and our use of Max is very specific and thus limited from the broad range the program has. As such I would say I am an intermediate to advance user in some areas, but a beginner in other features.<br /><br />The book does not aim itself specifically at any one industry, but rather has a lot for everybody. And as such it is VERY useful. It is chokeful of tips, work arounds and time savers in every single area of Max. Even if you know the Max 6 version almost inside out (and who can honestly claim that?), there will still be a tonne of reminders on good workflow and timesavers, easily worth the cover price. This is not the kind of book you read from cover to cover, but rather flip through, and then keep close to your workstation, as problems arise. I use the materials chapter the most due to the nature of my work, but I am deeply grateful for all the goodies on lightning, rendering and modelling etc. as well.<br /><br />This book is for everybody, save absolute gurus and people who have never touched a 3D application before.	2004-11-19

And this one was eagerly anticipated to say the least. I truly wish I was about to write a glorious review, because that would mean I had another new favourite book - but alas that is not so.<br /><br />First a gripe. Why is it that 80% of the people who write books like this come more across as somebody looking for a job (and using the book as leverage for that), rather than the seasoned pro with several high profile jobs behind them? This seems to be another one.<br /><br />David Franson takes us through a couple of different scenarios from a lackluster medieval fantasy tutorial to a few weapons tutorials, and ends up with the most interesting piece in the book, a dark futuristic wall tutorial (think Doom 3). However the level of specifications aimed for makes you wonder. At the moment, the world is eagerly awaiting Half Life 2, and Doom 3 will come out just in a few weeks. The texturing work in the current generation of FPS 3D games makes the stuff in this book look laughable. I know the book is fairly recently published, still it is only aiming for quality of work along the lines of Return to Castle Wolfenstein.<br /><br />So when the users will painstakingly sit and make very dimensional textures, alluding to a lot of shapes and objects beyond the geometry, then they'll quickly and rudely find out that that was ten years ago. These days you have polygons enough for the pipes on your walls.<br /><br />This seems to completely escape the author, which immediately gives it away as newbie work. So if you are expecting professional grade texture work from this book, don't bother we are unfortunately not even talking skilled mod skinner level, more like hopeful new joiner of mediocre mod team quality level.<br /><br />I showed the book to my texturing lecturer, who is fresh out of the games industry (where she worked as a texture artist), and immediately the beginners mistakes were jumping at her. Guys, there is nothing in this book you can't find better and more up to date on the web. If you are lost for where to look, check out CG Talk. Or go pick up Matthew Omernick's superb book Creating the Art of the Game, which for once was written by an expert (he worked on Medal of Honor and is now Art Director with Lucasarts - not just gave up his programming or law career like David Franson here), and truly shows it.g in this book you can't find better and more up to date on the web.

All of them wants to deal primarily with the big fluffy ideas of the lead design - the overall idea of the game and so forth. Few of them has anything to say about the actual execution in terms of level design for example.<br />Untill now. Despite hating the title (and the colour scheme) of this book, I have to bow to the ultimate thing. This is as good a good as you will get right now about actually building game worlds - the level designs, the modelling, the texturing, the lighting and so forth. It also has one of the mandatory chapters on getting into the industry, where Tom Meigs goes beyond the usual war stories from the pros and repetitive listing of roles in the games industry, to actually offer the reader a good ammount of introspective questions to ponder and sage advice to gear up for the bumpy ride ahead.<br />So from hating it, this book has become one of my absolute favourites on games design. Well done Tom Meigs, whoever you are!	2004-05-19

Which is of course why you buy a book like this.<br />I was very disappointed when I received the book. It serves more as a look back through his back catalogue of work (some unpublished stuff as well). There are a few (very few) pieces of advice and tips on how to set up your reference photos and prepare a portfolio, but overall it is so general and vague that you will learn little more than &quot;there is no one way to paint skin colour&quot; or &quot;it takes time to get good&quot;. Chances are you already knew that...<br />This book was either compiled in a hurry by request of Boris Vallejo's financial advisor, or he is simply not interested in passing on the knowledge he has of his craft. Quite disappointing.	2004-04-21

No fluff, just get results and that in the straight path from A to B.<br />Bousquet chooses to focus on modelling, rigging and animating. In fact the book is just one long tutorial, where you start by building the character on the cover, then progress to rigging and skinning it and finally animating it.<br />Whereas there is A LOT MORE to 3ds Max than that, such as rendering, lighting and texturing, this is a very solid approach for the beginner, who wants to quickly get to that &quot;Wow! I made that?!&quot; stage. Also a word of caution, this book will not teach you many different approaches to modelling or animating per se, just one. But I have to say, that what it focuses on, it does very well. Clear and straight forward explanations, that get you from A to B very quickly. As a tad more experienced user, than the book's target group there wasn't too many new things for me, but I particularly enjoyed/benefitted from the chapters on rigging and skinning. Do anybody enjoy doing that? That is beyond me.<br />The book is mostly in colours, which really should be the norm with such a visually oriented topic as 3D animation.<br />I would say that this book is very well aimed at the beginner, who has never spent any serious time with a 3D application or with Max specifically. Once done with the book-long tutorial, you will have learnt a lot, and hopefully have the appetite to learn more on your own or through other materials/books.<br />Like I said, if you are a beginner, and you are impatient, and want to see things moving on your screen fast, this book will take you there. Fast!	2004-02-16

Very few books deal with this topic in a satisfactory manner, so every time you see a new release advertised, you get your hopes up.<br />Well this one was a letdown, because it contained very little information, I hadn't found for free on the internet. Here is what I wished I had known before forking out my cash...<br />The book starts off with a section where the author takes you through a few of his war stories and learned rules. A lot of them makes sense and are a good contribution to the book as such. An example could be \\"Share your toys\\", where Pedersen urges us to help others unselfishly, instead of trying to keep your experience and succes to yourself.<br />The next section is devoted to game ideas. In this chapter Pedersen lists more then 1200 ideas for games. The ideas consist of an extensive list of sports (of which many have been developed as games today), movies (where he lists the main idea behind each movie), board games, music and authors. Some of these have merrit, but the 1200+ number is not so solid. For example \\"mythology\\", \\"mythological creatures\\", \\"norse mythology\\" and \\"Irish mythology\\" are counted as 4 different game ideas. In my opinion, these first two sections are the most valuable in the book, and you should only consider buying it if these things have caught your attention.<br />The third section is devoted to research. One such object of research is a comparisson between the Rainbow Six and Delta Force series of games. Pedersen goes to great lengths to name every weapon in each game (+ their sequels and mission disks). In my book this doesn't really add value to the research. Whereas the parts about what is good and bad about each game is non-existent for quite a few of the examples and when it is existent it is limited to a few sentences like \\"has multiplayer support\\". Whereas research in design work obviously has its place, Pedersen really gets around the nitty gritty and important bits in an easy and rushed fashion.<br />The fourth part of the book is aimed introducing the games designer to the tools involved in building a game. Pedersen takes us through art and animation packages, game engines and sound tools to name a few. I wonder why this section is in the book, because everything reads like a marketing brochure for the individual products, so there is really no difference from what advertising materials you'd get from the respective producers of these tools. In this section we also get exposed to very basic programming and you learn to make your own tic-tac-toe game in Visual Basic. 5 pages are devoted to designing user interfaces. A good and welcome idea, but one could have wished for more then 5 pages, out of which several go to describe user interfaces in card games. Pedersen also tries to explain basic scriptwriting.<br />The last section (save the appendices) is devoted to different aspects of the design document. A basic attempt at explaining its use and structure. If you want to read about design documents and their application, I would suggest Luke Ahearn's Creating 3D Games That Sell, Rollings & Morris' Game Architecture and Design or Game Design Theory and Practise by Richard Rouse III.<br />When all is said and done, this book confuses me, because it tries to accomplish so many things(without an overarching structure), but does neither of them particularly well. It kinda reminds me of Luke Ahearn's Creating 3D Games That Sell, which is basically 3 different books attempted in one book. Just to clarify, that book contains sections which are easily worth the cover price. I am sorry, but Game Design Foundations will not teach you to be a games designer on your own, or how to break into the games industry as a budding games designer. Roger Pedersen got easily around this one; There are very few things you couldn't find on the net with half an hour of searching. If you are seriousabout learning games design and development, then get Rollings & Morris excellent book Game Architecture and Design, or if you just want a \\"foundation\\" course, check out Saltzman's Secret of the Sages. Sadly, this one doesn't deserve the cover price...about learning games design and development, then get Rollings & Morris excellent book Game Architecture and Design, or if you just want a \\"foundation\\" course, check out Saltzman's Secret of the Sages.

What strikes me about this book, is the seriousness and devotion that Owen Demers has for this topic. I have seldomly seen such wonderful piece of work. My congratulations to the author and publisher for accomplishing such a thoroughly high quality release!<br />This book is really what ALL artist should be forced to read at any point, but preferably the beginning, of their careers. It focuses on developing the art of seeing as the most important tool in your arsenal. Once you can SEE, then you can reconstruct any complicated or simple texture. This is of course a project so great that a lifetime is not enough, but nonetheless, I have never seen it handled better than in Digital Texturing & Painting. I love the idea that traditional artists will be able to find tons of insights in this book for digital artists. The new are teaching the old. But again even though the explicit theme of the book is textures for 3D purposes, the teaching is that this is just another tool, the underlying priciples are the same as in all visual art.<br />This is one book you should run to get now. Simply because it will make you a better artist, in whatever field you are, now and for good.	2002-04-22

And the page count is not as scary as most books on this topic (1000+). I guess as such is a good reference for a beginner in Maya. Above that level, I wonder if the more experienced reader will not quickly find it not comprehensive enough. It also depend on your learning style. I prefer to learn via tutorials that take me through the paces. This is one has very little of that, but is mostly like, this button does this and that menu is for that, and then you figure out yourself how to use it all in a project. But I suppose that will do if you are experienced in another 3D application, and you want to switch to Maya. Complete beginners are better advised to look for books like New Riders' Maya 4 Fundamentals (to be honest I don't own that book, but their 3DS Max 4 Fundamentals), that will make a point of explaining everything in this new 3D world.	2002-04-22

Nothing is more boring and frustrating than a 1000+ page tome that lists all the functions in alphabetical order, and leaves it up to you to make sense of them. Here you have 30 small tutorials that each show you a few of those effects, I am sure you are already rearing to make in Maya, if only you knew how. For a complete beginner in Maya, or 3D for that matter, this is going to be wonderland. For a slightly experienced Maya user, there is still so much to find. But the advanced Maya user might only find a few tutorial that will teach him or her new tricks.	2002-04-22

Physical that is. Now, as we all can imagine, serious gentleman lore comes from England. However the author is clearly not from the UK, I imagine he is German.<br />This does the book a lot of refreshing good. I believe we have 2 major schools of thought and style, when it comes to dressing a gentleman today. The days where you could hardheadedly insist that there exist no other fine tailoring than British are over. You have to relate to, and understand the Italian fashion tradition as well. Clearly it has proven its value by now. Something like that is not addressed in for example A Gentleman's Wardrobe - Classic Clothes for the Modern Man. I believe that the author not being from the UK has given him this clarity of vision.<br />However. Being well dressed at any occassion is only a small part of a gentleman's characteristics. That is why I hate to see the author dismiss many of the fundamental little tid bits that make up a gentleman in this text. I believe that takes a truly English nature to fully comprehend these and their importance in the middle of bowties and brogues. That is a shame. I could for example refer to the umbrella (a gentleman will wear an umbrella but NEVER open it!), which is pushed aside as ancient nonsense!<br />Take the interesting walk-through of the personal grooming and clothes, and leave most of the advice on behaviour. That is better found elsewhere, if your goal is to call yourself a true gentleman.	2002-01-03

Not that the other ones are not good books and all, but as a beginner I couldn't have done better than with 3DS MAX 4 Bible, and on top of that, I didn't need the other ones.<br />MAX 4 Bible does an excellent job of explaining sometimes quite complex technical matters in an easy going and interesting way. Add to that, that it takes you through all the important areas and gives you explanations of all functions.<br />I am pursuing a career in the games field, and this book has proved instrumental in learning this important tool.

There are detailed chapters on for example simulating flowing water (without expensive plugins), creating realistic underwater scenes, using the new max 4 IK, churning out textures for games, and even a bit of camera matching. And as usual, they are detailed enough to be usefull but advanced enough not to be patronising and time-wasting for the experienced reader, for whom the book is intended.<br />The small critisism I may have centers around the lighting effects in certain chapters. They seem somewhat basic, explaining much to very little effect. In general though, the tutorials do expand on many of max 4's new features - and the accompanying CD features bonus materials and projects from those authors that got a little carried away.

At that I was quite happy with it. Quickly I was able to make a few &quot;Wow! How did you do that?&quot; effects, which gives you appetite for more.<br />Do you know the Chinese proverb about giving a man a fish, and you feed him for a day, but give a man a fishing rod and you feed him for life?! Anyway, the way I see it, when you want to master a program like Photoshop or 3DS Max, you need 3 kinds of materials to take you to advanced level: Babysteps to show you around the program, teach you how things work and get you started on your first few projects; A detailed reference for later troubleshooting; And probably also some material on advanced effects or projects, that both can give you inspiration and get you through a few common advanced choke points.<br />This book is a little bit of 1 and 3. A shame because all beginners should be able to follow the instructions in the detailed tutorials. But still you don't learn anything about WHY did I just do what I did, or HOW can I use this in completely different situations. Also the focus of the book is more on touching up photos and applying effects to them, than creating illustrations, if that has your interest.<br />So without the focus, and the ability to teach you something valuable for the long run, I am hard pressed to give it more than 3 stars. A shame because there are nice effects in there, and everybody will be able to carry them out, thanks to the easy and detailed instructions. BUT they will not be able to understand them.<br />For users that need any of the 3 kinds of learning materials, described above, on photoshop. I would suggest the photoshop wow! book. It comes strong especially in the second and third cathegory, and is still very friendly and informative for beginners. Feel free to mail me if you have questions.	2001-09-05
US	51242572	R2M16IFDBWNXGS	0201722089	1139745	The Photoshop 6 WOW! Book	Books	5	31	32	N	Y	Simply the best for beginners, reference or advanced effects	For learning and mastering an impressive package like Photoshop 6 I usually say that you need 3 kinds of materials: 1. A beginners guide to show you the framework and teach you how the basics work; 2. A detailed reference volume for when you need to research the solution to a problem on your own; 3. A selection of impressive advanced effects to give you inspiration and solutions to common advanced problems. If you have access to these 3, all you need is sweat and time. Few books have it all, since many of these functions seems to contradict with each other. Another common flaw is that many books show you very impressive effects, and how to carry them out, but after doing so, when the initial &quot;Wow! Look what I just made!&quot; fades away, you have learned almost nothing and understand very little about how the effect was made.<br />Based on these criteria, I have to conclude that The Photoshop 6 Wow! Book has it all. This is definitely not my first book on Photoshop 6, but I wish it was. It would have saved me quite a few bucks, and taught me more in the same time.<br />My personal interest is creating illustrations, not so much applying effects to photos or making web graphics. But still the Wow! Book covers it all to a very satisfying degree, in fact with so much depth and detail, that this book doubles as my reference volume. Also it patiently takes its time to make sure beginners understand all the key concepts in Photoshop.<br />I am impressed. Very impressed. My verdict will have to be the old clich&eacute; about, &quot;this is the only book you'll need&quot;. But it can easily be the only book you'll need for a loooooong time.<br />Feel free to mail me if you have questions.	2001-09-05

I am a traditional artist, accomplished in the fields of acrylics, crayons and pencil work in particular. I have long been drooling over what can be accomplished with Photoshop and Painter and their likes, in terms of building artwork and illustrations from scratch. However making the jump to computer graphics has proved to be quite difficult or complex at best. I have purchased nummerous books on those programs but they have all been 99% about image editing and touching up or making graphics for the web. Not exactly what I needed.<br />Till now! This volume has with one fell swoop fulfilled all of my above wishes. In here I have found detailed explanations of every technique imaginable from gouache to coloured pencils. It is wonderful! The explanations and learning aside, the book is also chokefull of inspirational work from master painters and illustrators.<br />And this is not all. All the primary focus of the book is on illustration and painting, the book also covers the programs abilities in touching up photos and creating web graphics.<br />I am very impressed, and consoled that I will soon enough be able to master computer graphics as yet another artistic outlet thanks to this volume. I believe it offers just as much for both beginners, intermediaries and advanced artist.<br />If you have any of the same aspirations as I did, don't hesitate to buy this book. Not only is it one of the few books that can teach you what you need to know, but it is also excellent value for money, as the pages are jammed full of tips, instructions and vivid colour images. Wow! indeed.	2001-08-09

What title do you write for such a book? I have only praise for Bettger's book. The fact that it is a book written for salesmen should not keep anybody from reading it. In my life as a salesman, businessman and man no  book (aside from the Bible)has helped me as much as this. If everybody  applied its insight in human nature the world be a so much better and  happier palce to live.<br />Simply a must-read for ANY salesman, businessman,  manager or person that wants improve his/her results in interactions with  other people.<br />BY FAR THE BOOK THAT HAS HAD THE VASTEST IMPACT ON MY LIFE  AN CAREER! It doesn't get better than this!	2000-06-28

If you are looking for code and details on that level, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an insight in the industry's foremost minds (like Sid Meier  etc.) this is it!<br />A wealth of input and inspiration for anybody that  wants to start out in computer games whether with a studio or on his/her  own.	2000-06-27

Books	5	6	8	N	N	Brilliant and entertaining	To my knowledge the first book/research study that doesn't fail into the common trap of synthesizing the marketing secrets of the cathegory leaders, that 99% of us are not.<br />In that way a very interesting approach to  marketing. That aside the insights presented here are brilliant and  relevant. Also Morgan writes in a very enjoyable and lively style, which  definitely makes the understanding and digestion easier.<br />All in all an  entertaining book about a field that should interest everybody involved in  managing or marketing a business. Not bad at all!	2000-06-27

Good and sober information about bonding and teaching your child. During our pregnancy we carried out the majority of the suggestions in the book with amazing response. Today, although our daughter at present is only 2  months old, we have a wonderfully alert and happy daugther. She is very  intelligent, good at focusing and way ahead of the normal developmental  curve for an infant.<br />Also we enjoyed the advice on nutrition and living  in general.<br />All in all highly recommendable to any expecting parents.	2000-06-27

Usually most readers should get it the first time over. Thus the book lends itself  to a more jumping style of reading.<br />The bad things aside the book gives  plenty of input and inspiration to any progressive parent or teacher. I am  using the principles daily on my infant daughter with great results. The  book lays out a blueprint for basically teaching the infant any subject or  anything, so it is really up to you how far you want to take your child  from there.<br />I'll recommend it to anyone who is interested in maximizing  children's mental abilities.	2000-06-27

Although I am a big fan of Guy, this one was a disappointment compared to the standards I have come to expect from him. The title of book indicates a vast area to cover. But to my disappointment it seemed a bit inconsistent  or out focus/unfocused. Maybe like the title.<br />When all is said and done  it has a multitude of cases, quotes and points in the usual Kawasaki style  that can prove beneficial, but still not a clear classic.	2000-06-26

Michael Porter take cover. These Swedes have something to say, and they do so no holds barred. The contents might not all be white hot news to everybody, but all in all the  book is a great place to start if you want to get up to speed on the  immediate future and present. The books main attributes are:<br />A very  refreshing approach to the world, not just business/economics, including  humans as persons. Very wholistic, and I admire the way these intuitives  manage to link everything together in the cobweb we name the world.<br />The  style of writing is very intriguing in the way it is unheard of so far in  this genre. It is like a machine gun in its rhythm and explosiveness.<br />The  chapters on how to live and maximize your potential as a worker in the  future. Very useful to anybody.<br />I reccomend this book to anybody that  wants to know what this &quot;new economy&quot;, &quot;network  economy&quot; or &quot;internet economy&quot; means.	2000-06-26

For the entrepreneur in our day and age there is no way around this book. Just read the book, and thousands of ideas for new ventures will pop up in your mind. I would  even go as far as saying that any businessman today would benefit from this  collection of insights. I give it 5 stars because of the above + the fact  it is such an enjoyable and not beat around the bush read. I am looking  forward to Guy's next book.	2000-06-26
