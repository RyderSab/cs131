Events in my life that were sad suddenly became hilariously funny when seen through the \\"Sedaris\\" lense. I usually dont read non fiction but this a welcome cool long drink on a Florida hot summer day.  Read it if your need to laugh quietly for a month or two.	2004-11-16

I bought it because I liked the title however didnt read the summary in the back of the book. Imagine yourself in a world where classic fiction is part of the fabric of society.  Crime element is outhere trying to disrupt tbe fabric of society by stealing and altering our classic works of fiction.  Sound too high brow.  Not at all.  It is a fun fantasy, who-done-it novel for everyone.	2004-10-17

In this novel, she presents us with questions about love versus obsession.  I wondered throughout the novel why Van Tassel loves (or thinks he loves) Etna Bliss.  Clearly, he objectifies her.  She is a beautiful woman not emotionally available to him.  It seems that this fact alone makes him want her more.  What a dummy. I enjoyed this novel and I find it facinating to ponder questions about love like why we love who we love.	2004-09-05

This story demonstrates that life, so complex it seems at times, can be cut down to one thing-survival.	2004-09-01

Even thought I was skeptical that this book could live up to the praise I chose to read it and I am so glad I did.  Its not necessary to say any more about the literary credit to the author as the raving reviews already speak to the power of this novel.  This is a great story about a boy and his father and their lives in a Afghanistan before the terror of the Taliban. This is not a story about the politics of Afghanistan but the story of a boy, any boy.  Amir, Baba, Hassan and Sohbar will come to mind now when I hear news stories about Afghanistan.	2004-08-31

Time stands still for the hostages and hostage takers and yet so much is discovered about life, death and love.  While our characters are facing the worst possible danger of their lives, there is a sense of being more alive inspired by the presence of the Opera singer's beauty and talent. There is a juxatoposition between captivity or internment and feeling more alive.  The senses are heightened in the face of danger and awesome beauty.	2003-07-29

Kingsolver weaves plot and ecology or maybe biology in a swift blend that is hard not to understand.  Nature is about everything from sex to love of ones child.  I love this book.  I could not put it down and once I finished I couldnt wait to lend it to friend.	2003-05-07

Anita Shreve is a master in manipulating time in her stories.  We meet our main characters in the present after a 34 year separation and we go back in time to the first time they met.  This is a frustating love story.  I have no patience for cheaters.  If they loved each other so much why didnt they leave their spouses but I guess this is part of the intensity of extra marital love.<br /> Thomas is the same character from The Weight of Water . This is his story before and after the events on the first book.  I think you dont have to read The Weight of Water to appreciate this book but I think it would be pointless to read this book first and The Weight of Water second for this book gives you the surprinsing end of the first.	2003-01-25

Its very frustrating trying to understand why Carrie does what she does.  Why exactly is it she wasnt happy with Mike to begin with and why is it she cant be there with him after the accident and why is she not happy in NY with Kilroy and her new life.  She is plain selfish even though it appears she is acting selfless. Carrie simply cant decide what she wants until it just comes to her and she's already broken everyones heart (fiancees, new boyfriend and best friend). I felt very emotionally drained after reading this book.  I am grateful for being an able bodied person but other than that I didnt get much out of this book.	2002-12-21

Jeremiah Land, the father of our 11 year narrator, is a man of faith who loves God.  We are told about the goodwill of people such as the Lands, Nokes, Decuellars, etc., and about true miracles from our young narrator.  Having said this,  I didnt come away from the story like I just read a religious book but rather I was left with a feeling of spirituality from the characters.<br />Jeremiah and the family leave their home in search of the son, Davy.  This was a wonderful book about a family who love each other and live through an adventure already told many times before about good guys and bad guys and the west.	2002-11-30

There are 5 main characters in this story and each of them are given a chapter to tell us about themselves.  Like sea glass, each character is unique and remarkle on its own but somehow their fates merge in a story about strikes at the mills in new england.  This book would be a wonderfull read for a book club because it offers so many topics of discussion such as is it dishonorable to love a man other than your husband.	2002-11-21

It is well written and I found myself reflecting on insights it offered about people in general.  However, I didnt like the characters. San Francisco is the setting and its intertwined in the plot (not really a plot but rather a snap shot of many peoples lives). All the characters are smart, good looking and living in the moment without any regard for other people.  They are happiest in each others company partying and druging.  They want what they cant have and dont achieve anything.  Is Otto saying this is how we all are or just this particular click of friends, I am not sure but I didnt find myself identifying or liking any of them.  In spite of my lack of interest for the characters, I did finish it and I admire the author's writting style and talent.	2002-11-18

Barnaby is a man who you come to understand and feel sympathy for even though he is \\"loser\\".  This is how he is described in the jacket of the book.  Definitely, an overachiever he is not, however, he cares for old people and believes in angels.  How bad is that.  Read this book if you like to feel involved in the lives of characters.	2002-07-12

It made me think how well I know my loved ones and whether having a past matter.  Can we forgive someone for the horrible things they did in the past? This was a question that the main character Jorie faced after 13 years of marriage.  A question to ponder for all people in relationships. I liked the way the author explored relationships between women as sisters and friends. Rosarie and Kat almost stole the show.  I found their story and relationship more interesting than that of  Ethan and Jorie.  Overall, I think this book is about death.  Everyone is touch by it and each character is affected differently.	2002-06-12

There are no pictures and there is hardly any commentary but what there is, is wonderful.  My family's favorite recipe, the yellow pound cake with blood orange glaze is simple yet you get &quot;a lot of bang for your buck&quot;.  I usually skip the blood orange glaze and I add canned mandarin oranges or frozen raspberries to the top of batter after I pour it on the cake mold.

I dont think this book should be placed in a religious category because this book is more about women and history.  It made me think about being a woman today and given birth in a sterile hospital room and the dangers of birthing babies throughout history.  I also loved the relationship of women as sisters, daughters, mothers, wives and midwives. I can't wait for more from Anita Diamant.	2001-02-11

This book has affected me so deeply that I'm still thinking about it weeks after having read it.  To me this is not a book about the immigrant experience or even about an alcoholic' struggle.  This book explores the contrast of their existence.  Kathi is pitiful and the colonel is heroic(at the end).  While she clings on to the house as though it stands for sobriety, the colonel is determined to keep his house because it stands for freedom for his family from pretense.	2001-01-02

I avoid reading the back cover of books. I am glad I didnt in this case because had I known the main theme of this book I would not have read it.  I cried and laughed at the same time numerous times (when Curly tries to get Candy and Wally to adopt him).  I liked all the main characters except for Candy.  Unlike other characters in this novel who tend to be good but flawed, I didnt like what Cabdy did to Homer and I found nothing redeeming about her devotion to Wally. In some many different level, this is a great novel.  I read this book about a month ago and it has stayed with me.	2000-11-02

Binchy is a great storyteller.  You really get to know her characters and they make you feel involved in the story.  Although, the  book flows a little bit like a soap opera, i love how the reader gets  dragged into each of the characters trials and tribulations.  I agree with  oprah's comments about Gertie.  I can't believe she stayed with that no  good Jack but I guess that is why I love to read books.	1999-10-19
