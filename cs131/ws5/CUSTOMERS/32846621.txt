Une oeuvre exeptionnelle.<br />Résumé :<br />L'action se déroule dans un univers fictif : l'enfer. Venant de mourir, 3 personnages y arrivent pour y subir leur damnation éternelle.<br />Aspect 1 :  Le style crédible :<br />Certes, le style de « Huis clos » ne constitue pas, en apparence, un modèle de perfection littéraire, mais toutefois, ce choix volontaire rend l'histoire considérablement plus réelle.<br />En effet, le sujet amenait forcément à de différents styles de langage.<BR>Par nature fantastique, l'univers des morts vivants apparaît trop irréel, une écriture classique aurait accentué l'irréalisme. <br />Par ailleurs, chaque personnage a sa propre identité et provient d'un milieu social différent. Il est donc naturel que les personnages aient des niveaux de langage différent, ce qui est révélateur de leur personnalité. <br />Le lecteur ne s'ennuie pas, car le texte est ponctué de plusieurs gammes de tons : l'ironie ( ines : au mon dieu), humour, accents tragiques et lyriques. <br />Ainsi donc, l'écriture de « Huis clos » se révèle plus élaborée qu'elle ne le semble de prime abord. Elle est efficace et riche, d'une vigueur en définitive exemplaire. <br />Aspect 2 : les temps qui rendent l'uvre exceptionnelle :<br />De toute évidence, le temps est  un sujet compliqué, car l'éternité est une perception compliquée à exprimer.<br />Sartre a réussi une prouesse en la rendant concevable.<br />En effet, dès le début de l'histoire, Sartre brise habilement la chronologie, le temps de la terre est décalé face à celui de l'enfer. (Estelle : la vie passe vite sur terre).<BR>L' accélération  se fait plus rapide quand les personnages perdent contact avec la terre (...), ce qui ajoute à la perception d'un jour unique et continu. <BR>De plus, le fait que l'éternité est omniprésente, les damnés savent tous deux, ce qui ronge leur conscience, et le lecteur comprend facilement leur torture mentale, les personnages sont à nu devant le regard des autres et donc la célèbre phrase « l'enfer c'est les autres » est facilement comprise, et cela évite de longue description mentales monotones.<br />Pour conclure, Sartre a merveilleusement donné l'impression d' éternité, ce qui rend l'histoire quasiment réelle.<br />Aspect 3 : l'univers narratif exceptionnel :<br />L'univers narratif fantastique de Sartre  indique  clairement ses valeurs religieuses.<BR>Il se moque de l'enfer perçu par les chrétiens ( ..).<br />D'ailleurs, l'univers, montre le supplice qu'éprouvent les damnés.<BR>Les allusions aux objets manquant (miroir, brosse à dent), réussissent à un dépaysement total au lecteur, pour marquer  la différence d'avec un appartement normal et pour souligner le fait qu'ils sont morts.<br />En plus, les lecteurs imaginent clairement l'idée de renfermement, car l'univers narratif fait clairement comprendre l'idée sartrienne de l'enfer : c est un lieu qui englobe tout, un labyrinthe sans fin. Par exemple (...)<br />Voilà donc les raisons pour lesquelles, l'univers narratif rend l'histoire suggestive et concevable.	2003-12-07
