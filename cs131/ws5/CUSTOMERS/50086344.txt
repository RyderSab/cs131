I even read three books in between  ): The first two in this series were exciting and the romances were developed much better than Seth and Grace's.  I didn't care for Grace, especially. And the whole past lives thing thrown in at the end was unbelievable...I don't care for the villain being so quickly and clumsily introduced it left me just wanting to end the book and find out more about MJ and Bailey which I would have loved to hear more about.  Finish the series, but don't expect a compelling read...	2002-08-03

I didn't care much for the hero, he seemed like a man taken from her historical novels and didn't fit well in contemporary settings...He was a jerk at the beginning, then instantly loved her, and I didn't sense the connection that CC was going for.

If I have one complaint it's that the authors are 'sugar-coating' the end times. It almost makes you want to be there, and believe me you won't. While, this is fiction, there is one thing clear in the Bible, the Holy Spirit, Christ's presence will leave the earth during the tribulation thus why it says the Antichrist will rule the earth. So, to say that Rayford and the whole crew are being spoken to by God and angels is DEFINITELY fiction, those who are left are on their own, thus the reason to get right, now!	2001-12-19

It had a lot of potential w/ it being about Mickey, hubby #1, but it became so bogged down w/ trivial stuff and no action that I fell asleep nearly every night reading it.  I do like Dietz and Robb is O.K. (stupid, but O.K.)  It'd be nice to see her really work on a case w/ one of them again, instead of calling them, or thinking a quick thought about them.  <BR>I've enjoyed about 60% of the others, with G being my favorite, but I really don't care a whole lot about Kinsey.  She's becoming even more bitter and nasty.  I'd like to see some growth on her part.  I've heard P's not any better.

Guess we'll all know in the end, who was right.  Do you want to take the chance, though?  I am a Christian, a follower of Christ, the son of God.  I know because I've seen the amazing miracles and transformation in my life.  I know because I know God's word is true!  It's been tried time and time again!  But His word stands strong.  If you are truly seeking a personal relationship with Christ, all the theology will not be as important as your personal relationship with Him.  In answer to the Word being revealed by God...&quot;The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place.  He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testifies to everything he saw-that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot;  Rev 1:1-2<br />&quot;I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book:  If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.

DH wrote that Jesus was the first resurrected human.  But what about Jairus' daughter, and Lazarus?  While the resurrection story was interesting it didn't quite flow for me.  As for Quinn and Lisa...I'd be wondering for quite a while why I was the last sister he was interested in.  #4 doesn't work for me.

The last 10 pages jump ahead 2 years and are rather hurried along.  This happens at times during the series.  We talk about training the horses for pages upon pages and then in a small sentence it says, &quot;Meshach and Ophelia were married last week.&quot;  So, be prepared for surprises like that.

Then when the car accident finally happened I was bored for two tapes, then, started to dislike everyone.  Callie seemed nice enough at first and then after the accident, everyone hated her, then the inconsistencies began.  Bode became black???  But not black really b/c he had white parents and was raised black even though everyone in town knew he was white and Callie was black????  Most mixed marriages I've seen and know the child doesn't come out fair w/ blond hair??  So, how was Callie fair and Bode dark-skinned, etc.  Then Brie and Sela hated each other at first and always argued together, then move in together and become 'sisters'.  Bode describes Sela as a wonderful, peaceful person....then later says she's a piss-ant...Hello?  I began to dislike all these people and thought Callie was the way she was only b/c of Mama Pearl.  She was a totally different person at the end then at the beginning, and so I wished them all luck and threw the tapes in the trash.  Read Celebration if you like this author, but avoid this one.	2001-09-05

Like...it needed more understanding of the characters, and more depth in the storyline.  What was Amanda's mom's secret for Amanda?  She never told it.  Where was the closure with Jace and Amanda's mom and his mom who knew about the affair as well.  What happened to Tess?  Terry?  The account?  The plane wreck and her accident on the horse didn't pan out.  The ending when she thought he wanted her as his mistress, again, was just ridiculous.  This just seemed a little too hurried or something.  It is a one-day reader though, if you want some escape for a few hours.	2001-06-14

First, what in the world does the picture on the cover have to do with this story?  It was set in Jamaica, at times in Miami, and a little in Oklahoma where he was in oil.  Never once was a ranch or farm mentioned.  Second, Did King just wake up one day and decide he didn't love his sister-in-law anymore after years and years?  Don't think so.  Third, Our lovely heroine who's name I can't even recall even though I just read it is naive, a prissy, and in lust not love.  She is also stupid for marrying King b/c she's pregnant and he says he decided he was now in love with her.  Help us.  I see this love story ending at a court alright, a divorce court.	2001-06-09

The story was better than her last few, but can we get off the all are beautiful, famous, wealthy, and highly educated quick.  I was cracking up with some of the things Allegra did as an attorney, check your facts Ms. Steele, that's what a publicist or agent would do, not an attorney.

I feel Dane and Gloriana's love could have been a little deeper, though.  I didn't feel there was much closure with her modern world and doc friend either.

Co-dependent relationships happen all the time and I'm glad the author addressed this issue.  It was a great ending.  I'm not sure she deserved Woody, but I'm glad they ended up together.  Ms. Michaels referred to the tense relationship between parent and child at the beginning and then Kristine later refers to her parents as being, 'great' and 'there for her', etc.  It was confusing, but maybe that mysterious money that popped up at the end changed her views on 'those rotten parents'....That along with that 'weird' slave trading story were misplaced in the story and I wanted it to end sooner, but I was glad to see that Kristine didn't cave in when Logan returned.

I only continued reading to find out if she found her sisters, only to learn this was a trilogy, (It was not marked on the cover as such) The entire story could have been summed up in two pages if you had taken out all the sex scenes.  The major was a jerk and Lily was a bit too wanton.  A major disappointment for LLM readers.	2001-01-24

It seemed to slow moving with lots of monologue and predictable as well.  It is an easy read, though, if you want to take a break and forget about your normal life!!	2001-01-10

Yet, for her that is still above average.  It seemed rather slow at the beginning and the characters were somewhat boring at times.  I sensed no great passion, but Ireland was enchanting as well as the reader in the unabridged version.  Give it a try for a change of pace.	2000-11-21

Even educational philosophers and professionals admit that the prophesies of the Bible are coming true.  Soon, those who deny the Bible will have to retract their statements because all will bow before God.  I just hope they accept his love before this happens.  I'm glad non-Christians are reading this and pray it makes a difference in their lives.  Besides, what can it hurt to serve God?  And what if the Bible is right?  Make the choice to serve Him and I guarantee you will not regret it!!  <br />I liked the reviewing of plot in this book, because it has been a while since Indwelling and I needed the refreshing.  I am amazed at the brains behind these books, what an awesome task ahead.  Good luck to TL and JBJ.  I am praying for them and the many who are being witnessed through this series.  Read it, it's powerful!	2000-11-18

Catherine and Iris are my favorites when it comes to Mystery Contemporary...It did seem a bit much at the end with the extra villain, but I still enjoyed the characters.  BEWARE of the unabridged audio though, the reader did a horrible job with the male characters' voices.  It was very distracting with the storyline, but the story itself is excellent.	2000-11-15

I did not know that the trilogy had been extended until I found this book.  It should have stayed a trilogy.  The plot is flat and rather uneventful.  The previous characters are barely mentioned.  I had to force myself to finish this book.  Check out the first three.  They were wonderful.  I guess you only ride a horse for so long before it goes lame.	2000-11-07

I thought the scene in the shack with the boys was totally unneccessary.  Not enough plot, or understanding of it in the book as a whole.  Liked the old men though, and Victoria.  What did Guthrie have to do with this story anyway?  The characters didn't seem to mesh.  Oh well.  It was a book.	2000-10-31

I listened to the unabridged version while doing housework and found myself listening in the car as well.  I would recommend it.  Bess can be a little pain at times, but I got over that.  Kaldak was actually not a gorgeous stud, but that made it all the more believable.  Check it out.	2000-10-31

While the constant sobbing on Jen's part gets annoying and the ending is too sudden without a clear picture of the future or if the mystery is totally cleared up, it is still an book that kept my attention.

I found this one to be different and interesting.  Which is hard to find when you read as much as I do.  The ending was totally predictable, but it was still a fun, easy read.  I'm glad they didn't end up together, it would have never worked and made the story more realistic that way.  Go for MacDonald, Britt!!!	2000-10-11

I finished this book, but am sorry to say that I am done with this Dynasty.  Stick with Morris' more original plots and love stories, I started the fourth and put it down.  Way to much historical depth and no real desire to see the characters flourish, sorry to say.	2000-10-02

I would have enjoyed more depth to the Wakefields as well as more romance.  There is ALOT of historical information and detail.  If you can skim past some of it, it is a good read.  If you are a romance reader though, you may want to skip this series.	2000-09-29

I had a really hard time connecting with the plot when I listened to the abridged version.  I would NOT recommend it.  I'm going to try reading it  and see if it gets any better.  Was upset that Noah died as well.  I also  thought Kate was a little annoying I would have let him kill Ishmaru.  She  should really feel responsible for all those other deaths.	2000-09-19

The books are  short and very easy to read, though.  I find myself wanting more depth and  character growth.  The relationships were a bit sudden and flaky to me.  My  favorite characters were probably Jacob and June-Bug.  If you want to read  an exciting series try Debbie Maccomber's Promise, Texas series.	2000-09-01

The kids  were adorable as well.  The author could have cut out a 1/4 of the book,  though, but pulling out all the extra jargon of each character looking  'inside themself'.  It seemed 50% of the dialogue was a character thinking  and talking to themself.  The story about Cole and his father seemed out of  place and realizations hit him at weird times, like when he was in the tent  and Kate was kidnapped.  Is that a time to really take out your anger on  your dad leaving you 20-some yrs ago?  If you skim these dialogues, which I  started doing, you will find the story interesting and leave you wanting to  know more about this new family unit.	2000-08-26

I was upset that the  ending was given away at the beginning.  It kind of makes you feel hopeless  and not want to finish it.  I was pretty sick of Dan being 'sick'.  She  made a lot of DUMB choices as well as Nicolai.  So, they made their bed and  had to lie in it.  Literally, at times it seems.  I would have enjoyed the  book more if the overall tone of the book wasn't so depressing.	2000-08-26

She was a  bit naive, but faithful.  I liked Steve up until the end.  He really tried  to save his marriage with a yuppy spoiled snob!  I'm glad he left Merri.  DID NOT like Merri or Cal together! Yuck!  Boring, predictable, repetitive,  yes.  But most of all, no matter how you look at it, she is saying that  adultery is O.K. if you desire someone else, wrong!  Guess that explains  why she has had so many marriages and I'm still going strong with my one  and only hubby!!!  Don't bother reading, they end up divorced!	2000-08-21

After a long wait, I finally was able to purchase and read the second book  in the trilogy.  I was somewhat disappointed.  I read the reviews here and  noticed one reviewed it and had not even read the book yet.  Well, I read  it and can say that it is very choppy and wordy.  Not Wick's normal  standards.  I didn't see any romance or even care if Darvi and Dakota got  together.  I would love to see the passion and romance that were in the  Kensington Chronicles and her other series.  I fell asleep each night  trying to reading it, but since it is part of the series I'll wait another  year for the third book.  I was really disappointed to not have any new  news on Slater and Liberty.  I guess the next one is about Cash, hopefully  Lori will be back on track.	2000-08-14

It was O.K. but not Peart's best work.  I was confused by what happened after 1945.  There is a lot of revisiting of the old brides but I couldn't  keep the family tree straight.  I don't understand how Johnathan Montrose  could be Joy's great-grandfather and Jeffrey her great-great grandfather  when they were stepbrothers.  I really didn't like Joy to much, either.   She seemed a bit immature and flighty.  Evan was too old for her, and I  didn't care if they got together.  The ending was abrupt and didn't mention  the past like I wish it would have.  Did any of the books ever mention Kip  and Cara's hidden note about getting married!   I thought they would this  time, but they blew over it.  Anyway, it was a conclusion.	2000-04-13

I just finished Midnight Sun and it was heart-breaking when I read the last page and knew that I would never know what further happened to Karl,Elsa, James, Kaatje, Tora and Trent.

I hope she doesn't read these reviews.  It would make me never want to pick up a pen and write again.  I enjoyed the continuation of  characters and the fact that there were no rape scenes.  I believe that if  there were more time given to this novel it could have come together much  better.  I think it's the editors that need to take more time reviewing the  manuscript before they publish the book.  Catherine!  read some of your  earlier works and maybe you'll see what you are missing.  I'd say borrow  but don't buy this one.  Here's hoping for a 5-star next time.	2000-02-23

It was a very long story about one incident, the wreck, that was drawn out way too long.  This is my first taste of Sue Miller and I'm  afraid my last.  If you are bored and like to read about insignificant  things such as how a person likes their tea or coffee, then this is the  book for you.	2000-02-08
