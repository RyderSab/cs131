This is a wonderful book set at the turn of the century.  It details the life of a spoiled son and of his family during the decline of their elite status.  The son, George, is married more to stature than to family bonds.  Easy to read, gripping and fun - this book has it all!	2001-01-23

The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions.  This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry.  Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter.  From there, the story lost steam.	2000-12-28

This book, although beautifully written, is attempting to capture a myriad of topics into one digestible story.  Racism, incest, thievery, ...you name it, this book tries to embrace it!  If it were a simple story, the subject matter may have kept my interest.  However, Faulkner's writing style of character based sections made the reading experience harder to enjoy.	2000-12-28

Much to my surprise, it was one of the best books I have ever read.  The characters were very identifiable and refreshing.   The writing style was easy to read and non-pretentious.

If you don't get to read this book, read his other works.  This book covers talks about a wealthy family and how it slowly fell into obscurity.

The book failed for me later with some of the other characters getting too  politically involved and too pompous.  The down to Earth parts of this book  involving Lucy, Walter and others were wonderful.  The tragedies at the end  left me scratching my head.	2000-01-16

Why anyone would say this is the best novel of the 20th century is beyond me.  Joyce seems to have many different themes going and breaks new literary ground in  this lengthy novel - but why all in one work?  This book is extremely  difficult to read, to say the least.<br />This book has so much innuendo and  hidden meanings that it makes your head spin!  What's with all the foreign  languages?  A novel should be enjoyable and not so much a study guide.  A  blind man can see that (\\"tap tap tap tap\\").<br />What book would you wish upon  your worst enemy?<br />Ulysses by James Joyce in any form.<br />Ghost of William  Shakespeare<br />Friends, Romans, Countrymen - lend me your annotated copy of  Ulysses!<br />Maybe Im being too hard on the book but I dont think so I will  give it another shot in a few years with a copy of cliff notes in my hand  but I dont think it will help very much can you read this you should check  out the last chapter of this utterly pretentious socalled novel by the way  dont tell reviewers of this or any book that they are inexperienced you  shouldnt have to go to Joyce 101 to understand a novel I wish I could give  no stars	1999-04-12

However, the book tried to tie religious feelings with characters that only on the surface appear to be faithful.  At least  Baldwin created an interesting struggle with faith and temptation.  But the  whole idea that repetitive sinners contain the Spirit is hypocrisy!  These  people just go through the motions of a faithful life and therefore, the  character descriptions are incorrect.	1999-03-17
