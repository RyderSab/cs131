US	41549714	R2W8C8DO33WTMP	0312853165	929229596	The Demon Princes, Vol. 2: The Face * The Book of Dreams	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Fourth and Fifth Books of the Demon Princes Series	\\"The Face\\", the first book in this volume, is probably the best of the five Demon Princes novels.  The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \\"The Face\\" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, \\"The Face\\" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br />Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course. <br /> <br />The last novel in the series, \\"The Book of Dreams\\", is competent but less biting than \\"The Face\\".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from \\"The Palace of Love\\".  \\"The Book of Dreams\\" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.  The best parts of this novel are the introductory segments to each chapter.  Short paragraphs cover a wide range of ground, from the hilarious philosophical basis of the Institute to the stunning character introductions for Treesong's various Paladins.	2005-10-14

Since then it's unclear what he's been up to.  I've managed to track down obscure references to another book called \\"Daemon Mask\\", which appears to be out of print.  Beyond that, he languishes in obscurity.  Which is certainly a shame, because \\"Warp Angel\\" is one for the ages.  It is the \\"War and Peace\\" of crud.  It is bad.  How bad.  This bad: <br /> <br />Peeling off his shirt, he felt waves of dry, oppressive heat on his skin, the ship's climate controls straining against winter.  Weighted by his hologrammed belt, Chev's pants hit the ground.  Carefully, he unwrapped the tongs of his scrotal shield and flung it aside.  It landed near the knife, clattering in the Devil-haunted shadows. <br /> <br />''He told himself, There is no stopping now.  If she can see the future, she knows what will happen next.  He took her face into his hands.  Surrounding her mouth with his own, he took a deep taste. <br /> <br />She choked as she pulled away, wiping crusts of dried blood from her lips. <br /> <br />\\"I'm sorry,\\" he said.  Her underrgarments twisted in his fingers as he jerked them loose. <br /> <br />Ivor nested closer, trying to sample Chev's desire.'' (p. 206) <br /> <br />\\"Warp Angel\\" is not a good book.  It has been remarked that with a master, you can take just about any passage and finds examples of his or her brilliance.  Similarly, most any page of \\"Warp Angel\\" coughs up a sample of atrocious prose.  Hopen simply has no clue how to write.  He bounces around using the wrongs words, wrong sentences, wrong organization.  One hardly knows where to begin in cataloguing the blows that the English language suffers here.  Names.  The world this story occurs here is called Draconian - so much for subtlety - a city is named Dante and is built in circles, ooogh.  Nothing is worse than an author with faux pretensions to cleverness. <br /> <br />I could try explaining what this book is about, but ifI did you would likely question my sanity.  It has something to do with slavery and a women fighting to rescue her husband.  Beyond that no one can say, least of all the author.  He can't even decide who the main character is.  One candidate, Magen, swings back and forth between being a child and an adult.  Characters turn on their friends for no reason, betray or simply ignore their supposed ideals.  Ideas are dropped, never to be mentioned again.  And the books doesn't end.  It merely stops in mid-scene, mid-act, mid-conflict. <br /> <br />When treating with a book so utterly incoherent, there's nothing I can say that accurately conveys what's wrong with it.  What were they thinking?  Did Tor publish this stinker (in hardcover!) without even reading it?  Did no one notice that you can't pull the slightest hint of a story out of this thing?  What's going on here?  I can make one observation about something staying consistent throughout the whole book.  Every female character, at every time, wears absurdly skimpy and revealing clothes.  I think that's our answer.  After all, science fiction is all about sex, right?  It just a bunch of pimply twelve-year-old males reading for gratification, no?  That's certainly what Tor seems to believe.  Uuurgghhh.  This is the sort of book that give science fiction a bad name.  I hope Hopen enjoys his spot on the shelf next to Jim Theis, Robert Newcomb and Pel Torro, cause he certainly deserves it.	2005-10-06

It made a man feel what he should feel, that he was still in the childhood of the world.  That I should have come at last upon so singular a body was, I may say without vanity, not altogether singular, for I have a mania for belonging to as many societies as possible: I may be said to collect clubs, and I have accumulated a vast and fantastic variety of specimens ever since, in my audacious youth, I collected the Athenaeum.  At some future day, perhaps, I may tell tales of some of the other bodies to which I have belonged.  I will recount the doing's of the Dead Man's Shoes Society (that superficially immoral, but darkly justifiable communion); I will explain the curious origin of the Cat and Christian, the name of which has been so shamefully misinterpreted; and the world shall know at last why the Institute of Typewriters coalesced with the Red Tulip League.  Of the Ten Teacups, of course I dare not say a word.\\" (p. 2) <br /> <br />Reading a G. K. Chesterton book is the literary equivalent of staying at a homey English bed and breakfast in an adorably quaint little village at the end of a two-lane road fenced by hedge rows on either side.  It gives you this warm, fuzzy feeling of stepping back a few generations to a simpler but no less entertaining time.  In Chesterton's world the policemen are always stern, the sun is (almost) always setting, and gentlemen always have time for a philosophical tete-a-tete, even when there's a damsel waiting for rescue in the basement.  (Or is there?)  Which isn't to say that Chesterton viewed his society through rose-colored glasses; he didn't.  He may well be the only author capable of being charming and acerbic simultaneously.  But the point is in Chesterton's world, having fun always came first.  It's a world where, to co-opt a phrase from TerryPratchett, anything can happen and it usually does.  And once it's done happening there's yet more amusement to be had by rereading the story and unraveling the first half of the story all over again. <br /> <br />The Club of Queer Trades is open to any gentleman who can invent an entirely new job and make a steady living doing it.  This, of course, opens up marvelous vistas for stories, if the author's imagination is fertile enough.  And this is G. K. Chesterton that we're talking about, so questioning the author's qualifications falls mere inches short of blasphemy.  Consider tale number three, \\"The Awful Reason of the Vicar's Visit\\".  Narrator Swineburne is about to leave for a dinner party when a disheveled vicar appears on his doorstep, begging for help.  He has just escaped after being abducted by a band of ruffians disguised as old ladies, who where marching him off to take part in some unknown heinous crime.  The poor clergyman escaped only by feigning drunkenness to attract the attention of a policeman.  It all appears quite sinister, but could it be that the entire situation is explained by yet another average Joe pursuing a zany new occupation?  Indeed it could. <br /> <br />Joyfully twisted plots aside, Chesterton doesn't rest on his laurels.  Having set up the situation, he carefully tweaks every sentence to squeeze out the maximum humor.  Watching him slice and dice with the English language must remind anyone of Mark Twain's declaration that the difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.  So without any further ado, I will wrap with selected examples of his prose for your reading pleasure: <br /> <br />\\"He was a magnificent courtly gentleman; so much of a gentleman that he could show an unquestionable weakness of anger without altogether losing dignity; so much of a gentleman that even his faux pas were well-bred.\\" (p. 37) <br /> <br />\\"Truth of necessity must be stranger thanfiction, for fiction is the creation if the human mind, and therefore is congenial to it.\\" (p. 70) <br /> <br />\\"For some months, indeed for some years, people had detected something curious in the judge's conduct.  He seemed to have lost interest in the law, in which he had been beyond expression brilliant and terrible as a K. C., and to be occupied in giving personal and moral advice to the people concerned.  He talked more like a priest or a doctor, and a very outspoken one at that.  The first thrill was probably given when he said to a man who had attempted a crime of passion: <br />''I sentence you to three years' imprisonment, under the firm, and solemn, and God-given conviction, that what you require is three months at the seaside.'' He accused criminals from the bench, not so much of their obvious legal crimes, but of things that had never been heard of in a court of justice, monstrous egoism, lack of humour, and morbidity deliberately encouraged. ... All of this, of course, in the eyes of the sagacious, was premonitory of that melancholy and farcical day when his wits actually desert him in open court.  It was a libel case between two eminent and powerful financiers.  The case was long and complex; the advocates were long and eloquent; but at last, after weeks of rhetoric, the time came for the great judge to give a summing-up; and one of his celebrated masterpieces of lucidity and pulverising logic was looked for.  He had spoken very little during the prolonged affair, and he looked sad and lowering at the end of it.  He was silent for a moment, and then burst into a stentorian song.  His remarks (as reported) were as follows:- <br /> <br />O Rowty-owty tiddly owty <br />Tiddly-owty tiddly-owty <br />Highty-ighty tiddly-ighty <br />Tiddly-ighty ow.\\" (p. 4-5)	2005-09-29

What does one say about a book that hits the quintessence of average?  We have our spunky little priestess Hehzi, who finds herself going up against a cabal of evil priests bent on, well, being evil priests.  Elsewhere, wilderness warrior Perkar joins a quest to speak with a forest god about opening up some more land for cultivation.  Unfortunately Perkar has recently had sex with a goddess, never a good thing, and consequently emerges with a fierce determination to kill some other god.  Mix that with a good-sized helping of magic swords, swashbuckling action, and ill-fated attempts at romance, and you got a recipe for a book that plods along. <br /> <br />I won't say that \\"The Waterborn\\" is formulaic.  It's not.  In fact it has its share of genuine plot twists, hidden identities, and deftly concealed secrets.  It would be more accurate to say that \\"The Waterborn\\" is a checklist novel.  Stuff gets thrown in - the sex scenes, the irksome suitor, the mysterious warrior - and one feels it's merely because the author feels a fantasy needs to have all that stuff.  I do certainly credit Keyes with respecting the reader's intelligence.  \\"The Waterborn\\" unfolds with careful attention to motivation and psychology. <br /> <br />Keyes does have a mighty struggle with dialogue, unfortunately.  Whenever people talk in this book, it's organized more around getting across the needed information rather than imitating the flow of a real conversation.  I should perhaps be lenient.  As Ernest Hemingway famously remarked, writing dialogue that really sounds like real people talking is the hardest thing any writer ever has to do, and it surely can't be done without practice.  But as for that, I always review books by content, not caring whether it's the author's first effort or not.	2005-09-25

Dictionaries are known for their stale and life-sucking definitions, of course, but who cares?  We all know what adventure is.  Adventure is when you set out from your door determined to ditch your humdrum existence for an epic life.  It's the throbbing of your heart as you head towards unknown lands and unguessable challenges.  It's the feel of the wind in your face, the rush of a good fight, the taste of participation in events far larger than your humble life.<br /><br />I would know, I suppose.  After all, I just finished reading one of the finest adventure stories ever written.  \\"Mortal Engines\\", by Philip Reeve, has all the elements aligned just right for a good, old-fashioned science fiction yarn.  Tom and Katherine and her father Thaddeus Valentine are all residents, or perhaps passengers, on the city of London.  London, long since deciding that southern England is a slum, has been mounted on treads and now prowls the badlands of Eurasia, hunting prey in the form of smaller towns.  A feisty assassin interrupts the not-so-peaceful life of the city, leading to Tom getting thrown out onto the bare ground and caught up in a rollicking worldwide journey.  Katherine, meanwhile, plunges into the labyrinthine intrigues of the city, hot on the tail of strange events and a mysterious new technology.<br /><br />As an adventure tale, Reeve hits all the right buttons.  The scope is huge, with Tom crossing vast swaths of land and engaging in all manner of narrow escapes.  The world is thought out with the utmost care, and fans of Phillip Pullman and James Stoddard will certainly delight in the vaguely Victorian social scene found on these traveling behemoths.  Never one to rest on his laurels, Reeve constantly tosses out new settings and sparkling concepts, including a flying city, half-mechanical soldiers, and a \\"pirate town\\" with a captain desperate for some culture.  With loving attention to detail, Reeve creates a world teeming with wonder yet gradually rusting into decay.  One minor measure of a speculative author is there skill at naming; Reeve masters that with a great role-call of perfectly selected monikers: Ormey Wreyland, Anna Fang, Chudleigh Pomeroy, Clytie Potts, Herbert Melliphant, Bethnal Green, Magnus Crome, Chrysler Peavey, Bevis Pod, and that's all in the first few chapters.<br /><br />\\"Mortal Engines\\" would certainly have scored highly enough just as a slick, fast-paced page-turner.  Philip Reeve, however, decides to up the ante by throwing in layers of moral complexity rarely scene in a supposedly juvenile adventure tale, or indeed in any science fiction story.  Tom, Katherine, and others not only face towering obstacles, but also must deal with having their personal worldviews sent spinning.  Adult characters who seemed wise and laudable prove to be snakes, and Tom in particular sees all his beliefs flying to pieces as his travels lead him to new vistas and new cultures.

A novel is one piece, a collection many.  But enough chains run through \\"Innocents Aboard\\" to deal with it as a whole.  This is not because Wolfe specifically picked out works that would function well together.  But here's an amazing thing about Wolfe's career: that although it has spanned three decades, twenty plus novels and hundreds of smaller tales covering a rather mind-blowing variety of settings, set-ups, and deliveries, he has managed to clutch tightly to common threads throughout. <br /> <br />Thread number one, perhaps, is the slipperiness of the narrator.  A well-known critic has remarked that Wolfe's career goal may be to prove that there is no reliable narrator.  He's covered all possible types one by one, showing us the dangers of trusting a person who has perfect memory or no memory at all, high intelligence or complete immaturity, and so forth.  In \\"Innocents Aboard\\" many stories open with problems of reliability.  Of necessity, as this book contains only fantasy and dark fantasy/horror tales, everything that takes place must be somewhat strange.  As such, the narrators know that their listeners  may be skeptical of what they hear.  Often times they say as much outright, and are reassured that the listeners are at least willing to listen. <br /> <br />For instance \\"The Monday Man\\" begins when an average Joe asks his policeman friend to go fishing.  But the policeman friend always refuses invitations to fishing trips, and eventually decides to explain why.  His story, a delicious twist on a standard police tale, features a blue-jeans thief who defies expectations by turning out to be less than what he seems, and wraps with a quite comepelling reason to avoid the sport of angling.  But the point, in Wolfe's view, is how to reconcile the huge intrusion of the supernatural into reasonably normal human existence.  He does it with style, as always. <br /> <br />The other stories in \\"Innocents Aboard\\" range everywhere, from the mythological tale \\"The Old Woman whose Roling Pin is the Sun\\"  to the historical horror fest \\"The Desert Traveler\\".  True to form, not everything is as simple as \\"The Monday Man\\"; some, such as \\"The Tree is My Hat\\" and \\"Houston, 1943\\" will require devoted rereads to ferret out their meaning.  But again true to form, they're mainly worth the effort.	2005-09-15
US	41549714	R1CX6PV7PHUL1F	1902002164	74030128	The Iron Dream	Books	4	51	53	N	N	A must read	Holding a spot in science fiction/fantasy legend as 'the book that was meant to be bad', Norman Spinrad's \\"The Iron Dream\\" is a thought provoking look humanity's violent impulses and the dark side of bad pulp writing.  The concept is simple enough: Adolf Hitler, dismissing the nascent Nazi Party as a bunch of beer hall debaters, leaves Munich for The United States in 1919.  He scrapes by as an illustrator and fanzine editor for several years before switching to science fiction novels.  \\"The Iron Dream\\" purports to be his last work, dashed off in a mere six weeks before he died in 1953. <br /> <br />As an exercise in tedious, repetitive action and sledgehammer philosophy, \\"The Iron Dream\\" makes its point in bold strokes.  We follow protagonist Feric Jagger as he travels to his homeland of Heldon, the only genetically untainted homeland in a world otherwise overrun with foul mutants.  Musing on the importance of genetic purity in almost every paragraph, Feric forms a motorcycle gang into 'the Knights of the Swastika' and marches off to dominate first Heldon, then the world.  The second half of the book unfolds as an orgy of violence, as Feric's forces slash, smash, and blast their way through massive armies of mutants under the sway of the mind-controlling Dominators of Zind. <br /> <br />Through this exaggerated take on pulp SF, Spinrad makes us look the aspects of our genre that many may wish to deny.  For sure, a lot of crap science fiction and fantasy has featured unbridled bloodlust and unsublte promotion of a philosophy not far from fascism.  For all that, though, one might be tempted to say that Spinrad went too far, and that surely not even the dumbest fan would be tricked by something so absurd.  This would be wrong.  Not only did much pulp nonsense from the 50's and 60's actually reflect such idealogy, but so does some stuff getting published today.  Anyone who's had the misfortune to come across books by Terry Goodkind or Robert Newcomb, for instance, knowshow those authors hew uncomfortably close to the faux Hitler's celebration of fascism, genocide, and ultraviolent misogyny.  (Interestingly Goodkind and Newcomb also duplicate the lesser details of \\"The Iron Dream\\", such as the hilarious abuse of phallic symbols and the creepy obsession with boots and skin-tight black leather for both genders.  Perhaps Spinrad should consider a plagarism lawsuit.) <br /> <br />The book's crown jewel is an afterword by a stuffy academic.  Homer Whipple of New York University offers biographical details (Hitler suffered from syhpilis late in life), saucy gossip (he was known as something of a Don Juan at science fiction conventions), fan reactions (the fanciful costumes he described in the book are now favorites at costume parties), historical background (the fall of Germany to the communists in 1939 remained a sore point throughout Hitler's life), and much more.  Having decided to write the book, Spinrad milked the concept for everything it was worth.  For instance, the inside cover urges us to enjoy another list of fine SF classics by Adolf Hitler.  It starts with inoccuous titles like \\"Emperor of the Asteroids\\", but then moves to more sinister titles such as \\"The Master Race\\" and \\"The Thousand Year Rule\\".  How many SF authors have begun their careers with harmless pulp adventure, but swamped their later works with barrels of dsitrubing personal philosophy? <br /> <br />\\"The Iron Dream\\" is not perfect.  As Ursula K. Leguin remarked in a review, it could have been quite a bit shorter.  But though not a great novel, it is an important novel.  Regrettably it is out of print now, but if you spot a copy floaitng around in your local used book store or at a garage sale, snap it up.	2005-09-05

Mark, after two years on the lam, impersonates Miles and commandeers a Dendarii ship.  Heading towards Jackson's Whole, he launches a desperate attack on House Bharaputa, intending to rescue a batch of clones who will soon be killed to provide transplant bodies.  Miles, once he rejoins the Dendarii, is none too happy about this development, partially because the vessel in question was supposed to be traded to a band of anti-Cetagandan rebels. <br /> <br />The plot thickens.  Marks' rescue mission doesn't go as planned (they never do), leaving him stranded and needing rescue himself.  Bel Thorne, meanwhile, has increasingly unclear loyalties, while the eight-foot-tall Taura is making unwanted advances on the man she thinks is Miles.  Meanwhile the real Miles shows up and finds himself having to deal Baron Bharaputa, Baron Ryoval, and Baron Fell, all of whom he left thoroughly jazzed off at the end of \\"Labyrinth\\", and ... well you get the idea. <br /> <br />About a third of the way through, though, \\"Mirror Dance\\" takes a surprising turn as we follow Mark back to Barrayar.  There he faces the complications of delaing with Cordelia and Aral, navigating the social customs of a world he's never seen before, and handling increasingly tricky legal dilemmas brought on by his unusual heritage.  In truth science fiction is an art with two main components: imaging weird scenarios, sand figuring out how humans would deal with such scenarios.  In \\"Mirror Dance\\", Bujold plunges head-first into all the gritty complications of being a clone: physical, family, and physcological.  But beyond that, she also plumbs every aspect of Mark's personality.  He emerges as one of the most astonishing characters that science fiction has ever seen. <br /> <br />And he's not alone.  One of the most incredible facets of the entire series is the way that all the characters work, develop, and progress in tandem.  Emperor Gregor Vorbarra, for instance, last seen four books ago in \\"The Vor Game\\", re-emerges as a grown and mature and pwerful leader.  He's exactly the sort needed to lead a wild and crazy place like Barrayar. <br /> <br />Somewhere it was written that every science ficiton novel needs to end with a bang, or perhasps a whole lot of bangs.  \\"Mirror Dance\\", with a near perfect beginning and middle, stumbles in the endgame because Bujold tries to cram too much into the grand finale.  To wit, both Mark and Miles are captured by various adversaries only to tap their hidden reserves of strength and devise sneaky ways out of their predicaments, just as Miles has already been doing for six books now.  The problem is that her endings are now growing repetitive.  You know that the good guys must escape in time to save the day and make everything right, so it's tedious to wait for it to happen.  But besides that, \\"Mirror Dance\\" is a triumph of intelligence and intensity.	2005-09-02

I usually begin a review by summarizing the beginning of the plot.  To do so, however, would spoil the fun because pulls surprise u-turns almost right from the beginning.  The joy of realizing how you've been mislead almost from page one is central to getting the book as a whole.  I might also go into characterization or theme, but similarly there I don't want you missing out on the experience of discovering it for yourself.  Not a mere collection of chapters, \\"The Man Who was Thursday\\" is a unified experience.  If Chesterton designed roller coasters, they would doubtlessly feature perilous drops and loops mixed together with a house of horrors and perhaps a bumper car section for good measure.<br /><br />Chesteron was a man of strong opinions, the strongest being in support of traditional Christian values.  For that reason and others, he looked to the past for his literary style.  He wrote \\"The Man Who was Thursday\\" in a Victorian voice, with steadily flowing and direct language spiced up by touches of proper middle-class humor.  As such, this book is a natural for anyone who understands the charm of eighteenth century England, an era when honor, politeness, and manners still counted.  As I'm determined not to spoil any part of this delightful tale for you, the best I can do is to show off some of Chesterton's brilliant prose.<br /><br />'You are not sufficiently democratic,' answered the policeman, 'but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business.  I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate.  But this new movement of ours is a very different affair.  We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals.  We remember the Roman Emperors.  We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance.  We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal.  We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher.  Compared to him, burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men; my heart goes out to them.  They accept the essential idea of man; they merely seek it wrongly.  Thieves respect property,  They merely wish the property to becomes their property that they may more perfectly respect it.' (p. 45)<br /><br />'Whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand, I replied with something which I could not even understand myself.  \\"I don't fancy,\\" he said, \\"that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation, since there inheres in it the introduction of lacunae, which are an essential of differentiation.\\"  I replied quite scornfully, \\"You read all that up in Pinckwerts; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe.\\"  It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as Pinckwerts or Glumpe.  But the people all around (rather to my surprise) seemed to remember them quite well, and the professor finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples, fell back upon a more popular form of it.  \\"I see,\\" he sneered, \\"you prevail like the false pig in Aesop.\\"  \\"And you fail,\\" I answered, smiling, \\"like the hedgehog in Montaigne.\\" (p. 91)<br /><br />'Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!' he said to Gregory, smiling.

But the people all around (rather to my surprise) seemed to remember them quite well, and the professor finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples, fell back upon a more popular form of it.  \\"I see,\\" he sneered, \\"you prevail like the false pig in Aesop.\\"  \\"And you fail,\\" I answered, smiling, \\"like the hedgehog in Montaigne.\\" (p. 91) <br /> <br /> <br />'Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!' he said to Gregory, smiling.

And it's true.  Bester wrote competent, frantically-paced science fiction, and that's all he wrote.  And you'll keep turning the pages, but after the conclusion you may find yourself wondering why you turned so many pages so quickly. <br /> <br />Gully Foyle is adrift, physically and psycologically.  Stranded on a broken spaceship, he thinks nothing of his daily struggle for survival until a passing freighter distinctly fails to resuce him.  From that point onward, the desire for revenge consumes him, and sees him crossing the solar system, adopting several fake identities, getting imprisoned, escaping, making a fortune, running a circus, wearing melting underwear, and more.  Plotwise, Bester thrives on cleverness.  Every character who shows up once shows up many times in many guises, reveal bizaree pasts and twisted motives.  At the end, though, Bester doesn't really accomplsih anything through these endless twists and u-turns.  You can have a character appear six times in the most unlikely places, but what's the point? <br /> <br />Another facet of adventure writing is progression.  You start from small events and go to big events.  There Bester succeeds with aplomb; he constantly raises the stakes for each new encounter.  By the end, the fate of the whole human race hangs not just in the balance, but in at least three different balances.  Even there, though, the books lacks some unity.  Logically, parts of it just don't hold together. <br /> <br />Bester is a good author who suffers posthumously from the fact that so many people insist he must be the best.  Our canon of great science fiction was determined by aging baby boomers.  Regrettably they stacked it with classics remembered from their own childhood.  As such, \\"The Stars my Destination\\" will likely continue to hog one spot on 'top ten SF' lists for many years to come, pushing out more deserving authors like Jack Vance and Philip K. Dick.  But we, at least, can accept \\"Stars\\" for what it is: a rollicking joy ride notable for wild ideas and big bangs.	2005-08-23

And even in the first two books of the Tawny Man trilogy she kept up a quite high standard.  But something happened on the way to the conclusion.  For sure \\"Fool's Fate\\" reads like a Robin Hobb novel.  The dialogue is intelligent, the characters astonishingly real, the world-building careful and solid, and the writing good at a technical level.  At a deeper level, however, Hobb has completely lost sight of what makes a good story.<br /><br />The best I can say for \\"Fool's Fate\\" is that it's a nine-hundred page book which may have a decent three-hundred page book lurking somewhere inside.  We left on in \\"Golden Fool\\" with our heroes anticipating their upcoming quest to slay the dragon Icefyre.  In \\"Fool's Fate\\" they spend one hundred pages at Buckkeep packing and preparing, one hundred pages sailing to the Out Islands, one hundred pages dithering around on an island, and another hundred dithering on a different island.  Four hundred pages gone before the plot is really in motion.<br /><br />We often fear that successful authors simply include anything that comes into their head, and their editors aren't brave enough to hack off unwarranted text.  Sadly that's exactly the case here.  One obvious example: Fitz taking care of Thick.  This consumes well over a hundred pages, with Fitz feeding Thick, dressing Thick, watching Thick be seasick, dragging Thick onto ships, arguing with Thick, fighting with Thick, etc...  This hits the crux of the problem with \\"Fool's Fate\\".  Hobb wants to say things that are true regardless of whether they're interesting.  So yes, of course retarded people were often abused and mistreated in past eras and yes a good person should treated the mentally challenged with respect.  But watching Fitz nursemaid Thick is like reading a novel about paint drying.  Needless to say Thick ends up doing something important at the end and thus justifying his presence on the quest.  But his role is trivially small.  Hobb could have written Thick out of the book entirely, and should have.  Like Jar Jar Binks, he single-handedly turns a decent artwork into a lousy one just by existing.<br /><br />Thick, though, is merely a victim of a larger disease: the dreaded bloat.  Conversations go on ten pages, fifteen pages, or more.  We see events that have no place in the story, visit places we don't need to see, hear the same thoughts repeated over and over.  We get a list of every character's emotions and facial expressions at every paragraph.<br /><br />Even after all this, \\"Fool's Fate\\" might have been redeemed by a good climactic showdown.  But that flops too.  The largest problem with the entire Tawny Man Trilogy is that the villains are so lame.  Laudwine was a paper tiger.  The new villainess in \\"Fool's Fate\\" is a horrendous cliche straight out of a Terry Goodkind novel: evil, laughs maniacally, sex-crazed, tortures people for no particular reason.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"Fool's Fate\\" collapses due to lack of planning and self-control.  Without a goal worth caring about, without progression towards a well-defined conclusion, there's just no reason to keep reading.  Several times I was on the verge of giving up; were this written by any other author, I most likely would have.  We can only hope that Hobb will get back on track with her next project.ck ends up doing something important at the end and thus justifying his presence on the quest.

Here we find a young priestess Arha, raised to lead those who worship the powers dwelling deep within the mysterious tombs.  Ursula K. Leguin delivers, just like always.  \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\" is almost ridiculously simple in its plot, powerful in its execution, and uncompormising in its moral vision. <br /> <br />The evocation of place is central to the novel's success.  The tombs themselves breath so much dusty stagnation and dark menace that they almost become a character in their own right.  Tied in with this is the tale of Arha's progress from early childhood to adolescence, which takes up the first half of the book.  By mingling setting and character growth, Leguin shows us how Arha's world shapes her, and asks us to consider the great mysteries surrounding religious and social attitudes towards child-rearing. <br /> <br />In the second half, of course, Ged shows up, intent on a mission though at first we don't know what.  The final seventy pages, though sparing in terms of plot, cover a lot of ground as the characters rotate around each other in anticipation of the climax.  \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\" is a masterpiece of setting, mood, and efficient prose, not to be missed by anyone who truly loves fantasy.	2005-08-04
US	41549714	R18R2XUL032SW	075640200X	57537931	Sovereign: Keys Of Power #3	Books	2	4	8	N	N	A bloodbath of epic proportions	I thoroughly enjoyed the first two novels in the Keys of Power series, \\"Inheritance\\" and \\"Fire and Sword\\".  But Simon Brown apparently suffered something of a breakdown while rounding out the trilogy with \\"Sovereign\\".  \\"Sovereign\\" is not a bad book so much as a very sloppy one.  In the end I didn't feel like writing a negative review.  I felt like marking up the book with a red pen and sending it back to Mr. Brown so that he could write a second draft. <br /> <br />For starters the book is rife with spelling and grammer errors.  That may be a trivial complaint, but it's hard to get caught up in the story when you have to jump over sentences like: <br /> <br />\\"Eynon put his ear to the ground but was unable to here the approaching enemy.\\" <br /> <br />Professional authors need professional editors, not just the MS Word spell checker.  Moreover, the story is created in a sloppy way.  Characters do things that don't make sense, huge stretches of time flow by with nothing happening, and there's no explanation for flawed strategic thinking from just about every side. <br /> <br />The book's biggest problem is the fighting.  In fact that's almost the only problem, since the book barely contains anything other than fighting.  This book has more raw carnage that anything I've ever read; it makes \\"Titus Andronicus\\" look pleasant by comparison.  Moreover, the carnage is gratuitous, repetitive, predictable, and often flat-out dumb.  For instance: <br /> <br />\\"The Chett front line crashed into the infantry, hacking off heads and limbs.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The cavalry rode in among the front line, hacking off heads and limbs until the field was soaked with blood.\\" <br /> <br />And so forth.  In truth the entire trilogy was bloody, but \\"Inheritance\\" and \\"Fire and Sword\\" mixed the battles in with touching personal moments featuring all the main characters.  In \\"Sovereign\\", the personal side is just plain gone, replaced by yet more lopped limbs and grotesque injuries.  A book needs more than just bloodshed to succeed.	2005-07-15

Anyone who writes a trilogy faces certain problems.  The big conclusion to the series must wait until the final book, but the second volume must hold our interest so we can get there.  The Keys of Power series may, at a surface level, look like a standard formula fantasy, but \\"Fire and Sword\\" proves to be full of surprises.  Would you have guessed, for instance, that Jenrosa's relationship with Lynan would fall apart as she falls for Kumul instead?  Or that a political power play would separate the royal couple in Kendra? <br /> <br />Not content to stay with the same scope as \\"Inheritance\\", Simon Brown continuously raises the stakes in \\"Fire and Sword\\".  The armies get larger, the magic more mind-blowing, the battles bigger and bloodier, and Brown doesn't pull any punches.  But most importantly, the characters are growing apace with the events in the story.  Everyone in the cast, major or minor role, develops and changes as they go along. <br /> <br />Scouring the fantasy section of the bookstore can be a tedious chore, given how much crap the companies flood us with.  But here is a story where the action is hot and the fighting is fierce, the humor is funny and the romance is romantic.  It's what we've all been looking for, and now that it's here we shouldn't turn away.	2005-06-26

There is a place where the forests are haunted, the caravans are impossibly huge, and the innkeepers are gruff but kindly.  It's called fantasyland, and Simon Brown lives there, or he might as well.  \\"Inheritance\\" is a fantasy novel of the old school, where you can tell who's a villain because they sneer on stage, and old men who have drunken their lives away in a bar can earn redemption by fighting to protect a slain friend's long lost son.  Some may call it cliched.  I call it a refreshing trip down memory lane.  This is a story that makes you feel young again, that makes you think that maybe a hapless band of misfits really can defeat a much larger group of evil minions. <br /> <br />Prince Lynan, youngest son of Queen Usharna, roams the streets hoping to find information about his long dead father.  General Chisal was a great leader in years long past, but was despised by the elitist upper classes for being a commoner.  Now sinister forces are moving to dispose of Lynan, but will one of Chisal's former soldiers show up just in time to stop the assassins?  (Take one guess.)  Thwarted in their first attempt, the bad guys dream up an even farther-reaching conspiracy, and soon Lynan and his companions are fleeing for their lives, with hordes of vicious mercenaries on their tail. <br /> <br />What makes this book work is Brown's careful writing.  He understands what the story needs, and also what the story doesn't need.  Every paragraph in \\"Inheritance\\" carries important information.  There are no space-fillers, no long descriptions, and instead we get tons of action and intrigue.  There's more plot in this book than in many twice its size.  Brown also develops his characters, major and minor, with the utmost care.  Everyone has believable motivations for what they do,including the villains.  The fight scenes come across clearly and with pulse-pounding excitement.  Perhaps most important is the intelligence of the book's structure.  The good guys actually win by being good - brave, intelligent, loyal, and resourceful - rather than by pulling magic tricks out of a hat.  In fact, \\"Inheritance\\" has virtually no magic. <br /> <br />For sure Simon Brown will never win a Hugo or get raves from the New York Review of Books, but he delivers everything you could rightfully expect from him.  When judging a book like \\"Inheritance\\", critics often say \\"I enjoyed this book at its own dumb level.\\"  But truth be told, literary midgets like David Drake, Terry Goodkind, and Robert Newcomb are the ones who write at a dumb level.  Simon Brown writes at a smart level; he writes a well-thought-out story with tons of excitement and no unnecessary violence, sex, or profanity.  For this I hold him up as an example of what fantasy can be, and I hope he decides to offer us a great deal more in the years to come.	2005-06-09

At the start we find Mathew Lewin traveling in disguise, still trying to recover his ring.  He eventually wins a sea battle, reunites with Father Thomas, and travels back to his hometown.  Once there, will Lara be willing to cast aside the last four years and hop right into an instant marriage with him?  You get one guess.  But they'd better hurry, because a big, bad conspiracy or Orlocks, power-hungry pirates and religious fanatics is about to sweep down on the free world.  And it will take every plot device in the dictionary if the good guys are to emerge on top.<br /><br />Of course there's nothing wrong with formula fantasy.  Graham's problem in \\"The Ancient Legacy\\" is that he uses the same scenes, almost to the letter, over and over again.  Whenever Mathew takes off into the face of danger, the other good guys insist on coming with him.  He tries to explain that he needs to go alone.  They refuse to listen.  There's a big argument.  And the conclusion is always the same.  This happens on at least five separate occasions, always with the same result.  Why bother writing it over and over?<br /><br />Also, a general tone of laziness pervades the writing.  Consider this howler: \\"A stack of crates stood along the far wall, and Mathew could easily guess what their contents contained.\\"  A couple pages later, a massive fight takes place at the \\"Ntrance\\" to a tunnel.  Got to watch out for those ntrances; you never know what might be lurking inside.	2005-06-02

That's a trivial question, as anything written by Neal Barrett, Jr. Is a good book.  If he wrote user manuals for vacuum cleaners, the result would still be a set of literary masterpieces.  But the more relevant question is whether you should read \\"Dawn's Uncertain Light\\", and there we must tread on more shaky ground. <br /> <br />\\"Dawn's Uncertain Light\\" is the sequel to \\"Through Darkest America\\", Barrett's earlier post-apocalyptic masterpiece about frontier life, warfare, and unsettling dietary habits.  \\"Dawn's Uncertain Light\\" picks up right where the earlier book left off, with Howie on a cross-country odyssey to find his sister at Silver Island.  Upon arriving, he finds the island in ruins and encounters a band of escapees who inform him that Carolee was killed.  This drives him to further pursuit of revenge, and he eventually falls in with a mysterious preacher who takes him by sea to California. <br /> <br />As far as writing goes, Barrett delivers exactly what's expected.  The writing is raw and simplistic, the emotions roaring forward just as they did in the first book.  The grand finale is a classic of Barrett-style cynicism.  But my beef (ahem) with this novel is that it retroactively changes the meaning of much of what happened in \\"Through Darkest America\\".  After reading the revelations at the end of \\"Dawn's Uncertain Light\\", the whole situation becomes less one of anarchic insanity reigning supreme, and more of a long gripe about religion and politics.  To my mind, \\"Through Darkest America\\" was so perfectly constructed to deliver its message that I didn't really want to see a sequel meddling around with it.	2005-05-22

Books	2	4	5	N	N	Not as good as the first	Mitchell Graham debuted in 2001 with \\"The Fifth Ring\\", a book that was lambasted by many, but I liked it.  I found that book to have a quaint and innocent charm that certain others are missing.  While other authors write alleged fantasy novels that are just thinly veiled pornography, Graham's rural farmboys were so artless that they could only stare wide-eyed upon encountering a whorehouse in a provincial town.  Well, \\"The Emerald Cavern\\" for the most part maintains the same sensibilities.  Indeed the opening chapter has Mathew Lewin gawking in disbelief after learning that his girlfriend has posed nude for a local artist.  So that's not the problem. <br /> <br />The problem, rather, is that this is a thuddingly boring book.  It opens, after a gap of several months, with Mathew and his friends in Sennia, living under the guardianship of King Gawl.  But trouble is brewing, in the form of evil priests, power-hungry sorceresses, and other menacing cliches.  Anyone with a clue will certainly be able to figure out who the bad guys are and what they're up to as soon as these unfortunate klutzes arrive on stage.  Regrettably, that category doesn't include the main characters, who walk into obvious traps time after time.  Beyond that, \\"The Emerald Cavern\\" comes with all the trappings of formula fantasy.  Minor characters get sliced and diced while major ones are invariably saved by off-the-wall plot devices.  The bad guys screw up their plans through stupid mistakes.  (Hint: never keep anyone alive just so you can torment them a little longer.)  Add to that a load of grammar and punctuation errors and some sloppy writing, and you've got a recipe for tedium.	2005-05-14

It starts with a lawyer who's in jail ... for pig-stealing.  Moreoever, he has the ability to predict the future by listening to the playlist on an oldies station.  I loved this prologue, because it had everything: mystery, comedy, intrigue, well-drawn characters, and more. <br /> <br />Too bad the entire book can't be like that.  As a matter of fact, the pig-stealing lawyer is never seen again.  Instead we get Ronny Dillon, who gets injured in an unfortunate fall from a high diving platform and loses his parents to a car accident on the same day.  Sent to live with his aunt and cousin in rural Georgia, Ronny soon gets caught up in a magical duel between Matt Welch, the local gentry, and his family.  The Welch family possesses inherited magical ability.  We first see Matt looking into the future in order to help a neighbor cheat on the SAT (I guess not all wizards can fight Balrogs for a living).  Later we learn that the magical ability carries a more sinister side as well.  The problem with this opening section is that it's too wordy.  The sentences ramble on and on, and tons of extra details are included for no apparent reason. <br /> <br />Later on Deitz does manage to pull his writing together, and focus on the story at hand.  But while he has all the elements - solid characters, a mysterious wanderer from out of town, dangerous past secrets to be revealed, a meaningful theme, and a whiz-bang ending - it somehow fails to add up to a great story.  You feel like you're reading, if not a first draft, then maybe a second draft.  Everyone's motivations are a little bit unclear, with too much unexplained running around purposelessly. <br /> <br />As with all his stories, Deitz is determined to set himself aside from standard fantasy.  In \\"Soulsmith\\" he struggles hard and generally succeeds at capturing small-town southern life, throwing in detailed trips to the story for ice cream, outdoor barbecues, and so forth.  Also, just as in the Tales of Eron series, he takes the reader for a spin on the sexually deviant side.  Besides a not inconsiderably amount of simmering homosexuality, we also get everything from an old history of incest popping up to a bizarre seen involving coin-operated vibrators and dildos.  Deitz may think that he's being hilariously raunchy here, but I found it to be a little bit off the mark.	2005-05-01

Here, cut off from neighboring cities by impassable barriers, a new culture is emerging.  Main character Ti-Jeanne works with her grandmother to provide traditional herbal remedies for the locals, but trouble is brewing in the form of a ruthless gang leader, Rudy, and his band of thugs.  They have reached a deal to provide a human heart for transplant to an important politician, and let's just say that they don't rank medical ethics as a very high priority. <br /> <br />This novel steers clear of most typical beginner mistakes.  The pacing is correct, without any noticeable lagging between important events.  Hopkinson employs a distinct ethnic dialect for all her characters, but it doesn't distract from the story.  And the overall writing level, while not perfect, does provide some gripping scenes.  I particularly enjoyed a wild magic ritual  wherein various spirits inhabit the bodies of the main characters. <br /> <br />But there's a problem with \\"Brown Girl in the Ring\\".  Much as it pains me to say it, it's the male characters.  All of them are portrayed as cruel, vindictive, and nasty.  All of them.  And even when a band of children arrive for just a few pages, we can't avoid noticing that the girls and smarter and more competent than the boys.  I would accept the villainous Rudy, though his scenes are a bit over-the-top (torturing a baby and skinning a woman alive, for starters), but Ti-Jeanne's ex-husband Rudy comes across as a total wimp, an almost nonentity.  The book would have benefit quite a bit if Hopkinson had given Tony some real spirit.	2005-04-23

An Earth reporter is closing in on the secret of his true identity.  An assassination attempt forces him into hiding.  Then, out of nowhere comes a plot twist so huge it will dazzle you.  And then another one.  And then another after that.  And more and more.  I personally am surprised that one person could manage to craft a book like this without going insane. but Bujold has always been a woman of many talents.  Here, on top juggling all the competing avenues of intrigue and suspense, she also manages to work in an amazingly detailed and sympathetic look at Miles' personal entanglements. <br /> <br />We've all heard this series referred to as the greatest space opera ever written.  When you read \\"Brothers in Arms\\", you'll realize that the earlier books in the series are actually just setupfor this and later volumes.

Come to think of it, most adults I know could also use such preparation as well.<br /><br />Children's literature is in a low, with nonsense like the \\"Captain Underpants\\" series that does little more than reward kids for being vulgar and boorish.  \\"The Hoboken Chicken Emergency\\" is one example of an author standing against the current.  It's appropriate for all ages.	2005-04-09

I have been told that the dying wordsof one famous 20th-century writer were, \\"I should have use fewer semicolons\\" - and although I have spent months fruitlessly trying to track down the chap responsible, I believe it none the less.  If it turns out that no one actually did say this on their death bed, I shall certainly save it up for my own.\\" (p. 127) <br /> <br />\\"Phrases abound that cry out for hyphens.  Those much-invoked examples of the little used car, the superfluous hair remover, the pickled herring merchant, the slow moving traffic and the two hundred odd members of the Conservative Party would all be lost without it.\\" (p. 169) <br /> <br />Lynne Truss set out to write a punctuation manual that would educate and entertain simultaneously.  The controversy breaking out in these pages concerns whether she succeeds at the second goal, since almost everyone agrees that she triumphs in the first.  Ms. Truss is very proper and British.  The Publisher's Note states that they rejected up front any attempt to Americanize her work; telling Truss not to be British would be like ordering Chris Rock not to be Black.  I find her funny.  If you opine that the English are the most humorous nationality, you'll likely agree.  In any case, I've provided some samples from \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" above, so that you can get a taste of Truss humor before you buy. <br /> <br />Underneath her British barbs and eclectic quotes, Truss has a point.  I had a stellar education, or at least I once thought so.  And I thought I knew about punctuation, until roughly one week ago.  It turns out that there are rules for applying the apostrophe whose existence I was previously unawareof.  Our standards have fallen.  Oh, how they have fallen!  And what can we do to raise them back up? <br /> <br />Beneath her points about punctuation, Truss has a deeper point about sloppy writing and sloppy thinking.  In her final chapter, she discusses the future of punctuation, specifically as it involves the new forms of communication available on the internet.  Everyone who discusses the book, including the author herself, employs the term stickler.  To many this holds a negative connotation, since a stickler is one who obsesses over irrelevant details.  But are punctuation, and its relatives such as grammar, spelling, and capitalization, really irrelevant?  A quick glance at message boards frequented by the younger set will assure you it isn't trivial, and that in some areas standards have slipped so low that actually reading what a person wrote is becoming impossible.  The younger generation believes that communicating some of their ideas some of the time is good enough.  Will we stand by and let our literary society crumble, drowned in a tidal wave of preteen net speak?  Will we continue to pretend that sloppiness and laziness in writing are tightly correlated with sloppiness and laziness in other areas of life?  If Lynne Truss has anything to say about it, the answer will be a definite no.	2005-04-02

Huge monuments begin appearing in southeast Asia out of nowhere, wrecking destruction on nearby landscapes and declaring the awesome victories of the military leader Kuin.  The twist is that the victories are dated in the future by twenty years, leading our hero and narrator Scott to wonder whether Kuin's conquests are inevitable.  Soon more and larger Chronoliths start popping up, and  Scott gets drawn into a work group trying to unravel the science behind them.  A former professor proposes that Kuin uses the monuments to create a feedback loop in space-time, each one making himself look more invincible and thus bringing more people to his cause.  What can be done against such a mind- and time-bending strategy? <br /> <br />So that's the story's hook.  The unexpected and disappointing part is that so little of this book is actually focused on the Chronoliths.  Science fiction has been trending away from science-focused stories to include more personal elements, and Wilson follows authors like Greg Bear in slapping soap-opera type plot devices on where they aren't needed.  The revolving drama centering around Scott, his ex wife, their daughter, his ex's new husband, his new wife, and her son could, with a little modification, be the basis of a Lifetime Original Movie.  To summarize the problem, Wilson has a lot of ground to cover in \\"The Chronoliths\\": decades of time and a worldwide scale.  With too many pages devoted to the drama of daily life, the big story of the Chronoliths themselves almost gets skimmed over for most of the book. <br /> <br />So do I recommend \\"The Chronoliths\\"?  I will say that Wilson has taken a big step upwards since \\"Darwinia\\".  This book manages an ending that is simultaneously open-ended an clear, and brings all the story-arcs to a logical meeting point at the end.  And the central mystery of who is sending these monuments through time, and how, does make \\"The Chronoliths\\" compulsively readable.  I've griped frequently about the current crop of authors making their books too long.  This is one of a very few that is actually to short.	2005-03-30

That, in the final analysis, is all you need to know.  The tempo is off at times, with too much attention getting placed on insignificant scenes while other more important developments are rushed through.  And characters other than Rali are all stultifyingly one-dimensional.

More importantly, it bridges the psychological gap between the happy-go-lucky fellow in \\"The Warrior's Apprentice\\" and the determined officer of later volumes.  A woman from the backcountry portion shows up at the door of the Vorkosigan estate, demanding justice for her murdered mutant baby.  Count Aral Vorkosigan sends Miles, backed by a few others, to lead the investigation and administer punishment to the guilty.  As a result, our young hero gets a brutal introduction to social injustice and emerges with new resolve.  This one well deserved its Hugo award for best novella. <br /> <br />In \\"Labyrinth\\", the Dendarii mercenaries run a pickup mission on the planetary criminal cesspool of Jackson's Whole.  In less than a hundred pages, Bujold crams in one surprise after another, plays our emotional heartstrings, and wraps everything up with a classic ending that will have everyone cheering.  But above all else, this is a story about the ramification of biotechnology and the confusion that it causes. <br /> <br />\\"Borders of Infinity\\" shows us the themes of the Vorkosigan saga at their most basic level.  The Cetagandans run a brutal, abusive POW camp.  Miles is sent on a secret mission to spring a prisoner, but gets an unpleasant shock when he arrives.  After that, starting with nothing (not even clothes), he takes on the task of organizing the anarchic camp.  Can one man, and a handicapped midget at that, whip thousands of cynical prisoners into order with only his mental strength?  Sure can.  But the drama, even though we know he will succeed, comes from watching it happen.	2005-03-20

Anyway, here we find Amalric old, crusty, and grey-haired, waiting for death while the world goes on without him.  His servant and bodyguard Quatervals convinces him to come to a ship naming ceremony in Orissa, where he finds hints of trouble brewing among his family and elsewhere.  Soon Janos Greycloak's great-granddaughter Janela shows up, and before you can say argosy they're off on a world-spanning adventure to the far kingdoms, which turn out to be even farther than previously thought. <br /> <br />In any case, most fans, I presume, read this series for three things: huge actions sequences, whopping magic, and hot sex.  In a survey of these three departments, I see plenty of opportunity for disappointment.  The first two-hundred pages or so are a drag, too much talk and too little fighting.  After that things do pick up somewhat, but still I found most of the battles scenes lacked intensity.  Cole and Bunch do find some redemption in the grand finale, however.  The magic, well, it's there, if you like that sort of thing.  And the sex?  Mostly off screen this time, though perhaps that's for the best, given how old our friend Amalric is by now.	2005-03-15

In the \\"Big Smash\\", most of Earth was blown to cinders.  Centuries later, the only surviving civilzation clings to a feeble existence on the west coast of the former United States.  Gathered in tribes with names like \\"Lightning\\" and \\"Eagle\\", they live roughly halfway between traditional native Americans and hippie communes.  In the absense of government, we instead get \\"Perfect Masters\\" flying around in balloon/bicycles, dispensing justice whenever forbidden industrial technologies make an appearance.  Spinrad pulls of a difficult trick with this society.  He wants us to laugh at the raunchy side of their lifestyle (sex, drugs, and rock and roll, minus the rock and roll) while also taking seriously their commitment to clean technology and the concept of karma. <br /> <br />However, there are also \\"spacers\\" living in the desert, using bad black technology such as oil and electricity.  Their plan is to build a space ship capable of reaching the Big Ear, and radio telescope built before the nuclear showdown that recieved messages from alien civilizations.  No spoilers here, since this is all spilled forth on the inside jacket.  Anyway, the success of this novel rides on the revelations that the character get when they actually reach the Big Ear being big and thought-provoking enough.  In my humble opinion, Spinrad doesn't quite cut it at this point in the story.  His creativity runs out and starts recycling stuff that sci fi fans have seen before.	2005-03-11
US	41549714	R3CORY5H1YF72J	0812513029	7053815	Dreamships	Books	1	3	10	N	N	Unreadable	Melissa Scott has won a shelf full of awards and pulled in heady praise from serious science fiction critics.  Perhaps her other books are worthy of it.  \\"Dreamships\\", however, lacks even the most basic building blocks of a good novel.  Where to begin.  That's Scott's problem to be sure.  The plot, involving a spaceship's management software gaining sentience and a mysterious social activist who believes that thinking computers deserve legal and social recognition, doesn't even get started until the book is half over.  The first hundred pages are the ship's crew wandering around a space station talking to various people.  After that, we get almost another full hundred of space flight, and the main character admiring the ship's fancy decorations.  Look, here's the problem.  Bi' Jian and her comrades just aren't interesting.  If you want to write a book about a living computer, then you have to write a book about a living computer.  Tagging on five chapters of filler before the book's main issue comes up will sink just about any project. <br /> <br />Beyond that, the discerning reader will notice something else missing: style.  The Titans of cyberpunk, William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, are not universally liked; some folks find them long-winded.  However, it's tough to argue that they don't have attitude.  \\"Neuromancer\\" and \\"Snow Crash\\" both deploy a tidal wave of frantic prose to match their frantic storylines, and scathing dialgoue for their scathing characters.  \\"Dreamships\\", in this regard, totally fails to deliver.  It's clear that Scott has ideas.  She has a picture of a highly concentrated, highly stessed futuristic society.  But her writing just doesn't get that picture across to the reader, and the characters have no voice whatsoever. <br /> <br />The folks at Tor certainly aren't doing Scott any favors by hyping her as comparable to Robert Heinlein and Alfred Bester.  At its best, \\"Dreamships\\" looks like a typical freshman effort by an author with a handful of ideas but insufficient experience.  And at its worse, well, that's best left unsaid.	2005-03-03

Fleeing to a remote hideaway in the mountains, he soon gets tempted by the dark magic of necromancy.  Without any doubt, this opening section is the high point of the novel.  Varis does not want to be a necromancer.  He knows that use of the magic, and of the various drugs needed to achieve spectral power, eventually drives users insane.  He knows, but he can't stop.  He becomes addicted to drugs, to magic, and to the power that it brings.  The portrait of addiction here is strikingly realistic, and indeed for those expecting just a standard swords of sorcery outing this may catch you by surprise.  As others have said, it makes Varis a unique villain.  We get caught between our loathing for his actions and our sympathy for the way that fate seemed to trap him.  These first few chapters are so deep and conflicted, it makes you wonder whether Volsky had some experience with addiction in a friend or family member that led her to create this character. <br /> <br />Regretably, the rest of the book doesn't maintain the same high level.  First of all, the reader must suffer a long, boring midsection that keeps Varis offstage while instead focusing on the Prince and Princess in exile.  And in contrast to the excellent characterization at the start, many of the minor characters are mere stick figures.  For instance, the academics at Frule at are little more than a tedious punch line. <br /> <br />In the end, Volsky seems afraid to push this story to its full potential.  At one point she briefly mentions that after coming to power, Varis actually passed a number of reforms that improved life dramatically for the ordinary people of his kingdom.  This raises the question, should we support a ruler who murdered and schemed his way to the throne if he proves a good ruler?  Raises the question, but never answers it.  The entire subjectis merely dropped in favor of a pyrotechnic ending.	2005-02-26
US	41549714	R1RHC38GI8I2XD	0812509048	808063711	Pallas	Books	1	16	57	N	N	There's good SF, there's bad SF, and there's Libertarian SF	L. Neil Smith is similar to Robert Heinlein, in much the same way that a fish taco is similar to the Great Wall of China.  Heinlein wrote novels, even going so far as to include archaic distractions such as plot and characters.  There is no way of identifying \\"Pallas\\" as a novel, since the entire thing is one long lecture on the virtues of toting weapons and murdering anybody who's different from L. Neil Smith.  This would be distressing enough, even without the fact that L. Neil Smith is insane.  But he is, and things get ugly. <br /> <br />The book features somebody (I hesitate to say a character) named \\"Emerson Ngu\\" (Emerson Ngu?), who heroically escapes from a Stalinist commune run by \\"Gibson Altman\\" (Gibson Altman?  And didn't Stalin kick the bucket in 1954?)  Since anyone who isn't an utter moron could figure out the ending of the book without bothering to read it, I won't bother explaining it.  The important point is that the book does not really contain anything other that Mr. Ngu lecturing on the virtues of libertarianism.  So in short, if you're one of the college-aged losers who has sexual fantasies involving Ayn Rand and uses the word hardcore to describe Ludwig von Mises, then you might as well read this slop heap since you have nothing better to do with your miserable life.  But if you're a normal person wondering whether there's any entertainment to be had in \\"Pallas\\", the answer is: NO.  Mr. Smith truly is insane; I'm not just saying that.  To give you some idea what you're up against, consider that in a recent column Smith accused George W. Bush of collaborating with Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br />But the point of the book is really this.  What are Gibson Altman's traits?  Well, he's an exile who's on the fringes of society, he sucks off the hard work of others, he spends his days reciting nonsensical political junk that no one else believes, and he knows that he has no future.  In other words, he's a perfect duplicate of the college-aged Libertarians who sit around schmoozing off their parents' money while knowing that no one in the real world will ever care about their moronic \\"philosophy\\".  Libertarianism is just a glurge fantasy about how the rest of us will eventually be dragged down by our own supposedly corrupt and decadent society.  But of course that fantasy will forever remain a fantasy, nothing more.  To truly understand how Smith and his ilk maintain such fanatic support among their microscopic fan club, what you truly need to understand is that these people are self-loathing.  It's no surprise that they enjoy seeing Smith repeatedly kick their own mirror image. <br /> <br />L. Neil Smith is like Robert Heinlein in one way at least; they both represent extremes in their approach to human existence.  About one of his greatest characters, Heinlein once said, \\"Lazarus Long is so in love with life that he refused to stop living it.\\"  The same could be said of Heinlein himself, whose soul lives on in his still-popular books though his body may have failed him.  Heinlein loved life, loved himself, loved others, loved science, loved art, loved love, loved sex, and he poured his love for all those things into his books.  Smith, on the other hand, hates everyone else almost as much as he hates himself.  His hatred for the human race is so strong that he'd gladly wipe it out just to stop other people from getting the enjoyment of life that he's denied to himself.  And the purpose of his fiction is to let himself slaughter off his enemies, which is virtually everyone, time and time again without giving them a chance to fight back.  I used to be offended by junk like this, but \\"Pallas\\" is so pathetic that it isn't worth my while to be offended.  I used to think that Terry Brooks was the worst author of all times.  Congratulations, Mr. Brooks.  Against all odds, and in defiance of smug predictions by so-called experts who insisted it was impossible, you've just reached number two.	2005-02-24

For sure this book is slow to get off the ground.  Much space at the beginning gets spent on Susan, along with the Raven and the Death of Rats, sequences that many fans may find lacking in traditional Pratchett humor.  Elsewhere Death is filling in for the jolly Hogfather, who has died of a sort, and makes the mistake of giving some youngsters what they want rather than what their parents think they should want.  The biggest laughs in the book come when the wizards show up, and join the search for the Hogfather together wtih an ant-powered mechanical computer named \\"Hex\\".  And when a wayward comment brings in a board-game toting Cheerful Fairy determined to lighten the mood, I guarantee you enough side-splitting laughter to make up for any dull passages at the start. <br /> <br />But beneath all this, there is more.  Pratchett has always snuck tinges of philosophy into his books.  In \\"Small Gods\\" we learned that Gods only wield power so long as people believe in them.  In \\"Pyramids\\" an unfortunate accident forced an entire kingdom to face its beliefs manifested in physical reality.  In \\"Witches Abroad\\" we learned that fiction shapes people rather than the other way around.  But in \\"Hogfather\\" he pushes the envelope further, asserting that all reality is make-believe, and all make-believe is reality, and furthermore that this is a good thing.  It's a daring statement and a daring approach to life, one that will make small-minded folks sneer, and imaginative ones, at the very least, stretch their minds to a new place. <br /> <br />Terry Pratchett is brave.  Not just a master of wit and a keen observer of human nature, he takes on everybody's most cherished institutions and sees how they were shaped by belief rather than reality.  It's a thought that frightens us because it's like realizing that your house is built on quicksand.  If the beliefs start to change, then the house can collapse.  But the point of \\"Hogfather\\", the real point, is that we should be joyful at realizing how powerful our beliefs are, because once we reach that realization we are free from the tyranny of gods and of moral absolutes.	2005-02-18

It is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it.  It is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply don't do.  When you read \\"The Worm Ouroboros\\" you'll realize that modern writers produce stories, but they don't tell Stories. <br /> <br />Since the English language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review, I'll just have to present samples of Eddison's writing: <br /> <br />\\"But a great wonder of this chamber, and a marvel to behold, was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone, carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster: here was a harpy with a screaming mouth, so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her: here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake: there a cockatrice made of a single ruby: there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight, cut for a cyclops, so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye: leviathans, all hewn from faultless gems, thrice the bulk of a big man's body, velvet-dark sapphires, crystolite, beryl, amethyst, and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold.\\" (7) <br /> <br />Everyone can write description, but only Eddison could write description like this.  He makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the \\"monsters\\" stick out in your mind.  And even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like, you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph.  Eddison realized that you can't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times. <br /> <br />\\"Now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills, and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days' space in the Zia valley, above the gorges.  Here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre, and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side.  High in the south , couched above great gray moraines, the Zia glacier, wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos, thrusts his snout into the valley.  Here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders, casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather.  The air blows sharp from the glacier, and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight.\\" (153) <br /> <br />Perhaps it's because I'm a mountain-climber myself, but I found Juss and Brandoch Daha's assault on Koshtra Pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters.  In real life no two mountain ranges are alike, yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains.  Eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers, feel the biting cold winds, and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes, he needs to give his mountains some real personality.  These samples, of course, only scratch the surface of Eddison's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor; he maintains this level, never flagging, for all two hundred thousand words. <br /> <br />But of course \\"The Worm Ouroboros\\" could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing.  On one side King Gorice XII of Witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will.  Opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of Demonland, lead by the magnificent Lord Juss and his family.  The ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea, across continents and mountain ranges.  And without any doubt Eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration: <br /> <br /> <br />\\"La Fireez,\\" said Juss, \\"we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee.  Yet must I hold my course; having sworn a strong oath that I would turn asideneither to the right nor to the left until I had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage.  So sware I or ever went that ill journey to Carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered.  Nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination.  But when that is done, no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of Pixyland, and many good things besides to be a token of our love.\\" <br />Said the Prince, \\"Thou doest right.  If thou didst other thou'dst have my blame.\\" <br />\\"And mine thereto,\\" said Gaslark.  \\"Do not I grieve, think'st thou, to see the Princess Armelline, my sweet young cousin, grow every day more wan o' the cheek and pale?  And all for sorrow and teen for her own true love, the Lord Goldry Bluszco.  And she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire, thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately.  I deem to-day better than to-morrow, and to-morrow better than his morrow, to set sail for wide-fronted Impland.\\" (315) <br /> <br />One of the most commonly used review terms is larger than life.  \\"The Worm Ouroboros\\" is larger than larger than life.  Indeed, after finishing you may wonder whether it would be more appropriate to refer to real life as \\"smaller than Eddison\\".	2005-02-12

What he doesn't have is the writing skill.  \\"Foreign Constellations\\" collects eight of his best-known stories from the 70's, published in various magazines but not previously appearing in book form.  His subjects range from the near future to the far far future, and from mass famine to wacky conspiracy theories to child raising.  But while he sees intriguing possibilities, he rarely pursues them far enough. <br /> <br />In \\"The Easy Way Out\\", a spaceship crash on a distant planet leaves only two survivors, a doctor and a spoiled rich boy.  One of them holds the titular piece of technology, a device which allows the user to escape into an ideal virtual reality world, but eventually kills them.  Should they turn on the device and enjoy a few last hours of perfect living, or leave it off a hope for the small chance of rescue?  An interesting dilemma to be sure, but the story arc doesn't really have much to say about it beyond the obvious.  Brunner's writing could define the word utilitarian: <br /> <br />\\"His heart sank.  Of all the people aboard, he would have chosen this man last to be his companion after the crash: Andrew Solichuk, who had never tired of informing anyone and everyone of how wealthy and influential his family was back on Earth and had complained endlessly about the food, the lack of comfort and amenities, the tase of the air, and the company he had to endure.\\" (p. 31)  It gets the point across, but it sure doesn't sparkle or make you want to sing the praises of Brunner's wordsmithing. <br /> <br />The later stories in this collection are the better ones.  My favorite would have to be \\"What Friends Are For\\".  A futuristic couple's child runs out of control due to bad parenting.  The state strongarms them into hiring a bioengineered alien \\"Friend\\" to take over child-raising duties.  But is the Friend really there to fix the kid or to fix the parents?

The twentieth century gave us plenty of words to describe the movement in art that eschewed normal dedication to order and jumbled together randomness, or at least stuff that might look random.  Detractors argue, of course, that anyone can throw together nonsense.  And they're right, of course.  But it takes a genius to produce good nonsense. <br /> <br />Joe Fernwright works as a healer of ceramic pots in a huge androgynous office complex in Cleveland.  Business is slow, especially since ceramic pots have been outlawed in favor of plastic.  To make matters worse, the government forces its citizens to dream about the glories of Che Guevera, inflation is diminishing his earnings, and he gets only limited use from telephone diciontaries and encyclopedias.  Joe is almost ready to give up when someone badly in need of pot-healing services starts dropping messages in his toilet.  After this mysterious benefactor transports him inside a crate, which he learns about by means of a radio show, Joe joins dozens of others on a galactic quest to Plowman's Planet where an enormous liquid (maybe) entity called Glimmung wishes to raise a gigantic cathedral from the depths of Mare Nostrum.  Or possibly Hell.  After that things really get strange. <br /> <br />Of course, as with Douglas Adams or Neil Barrett there's much more at work here than pure silliness.  The insanity is all being carefully orchestrated so as to make us think about the big questions of redemption, indivdiualism, determinism, death, purpose, and many others besides.  And the philosophy in turn gives way to yet more insanity, such as when Joe argues with a computer over whether Glimmung's arch-nemesis' victims are sitting ducks or sitting hens. <br /> <br />Phillip K. Dick obeyed few of the rules that any beginning writer is told to follow.  But time and again, when we read his works we see his shrewd insight cutting effortlessly through the morass of modern thought.Consider at the start where Joe and other bored office drones play \\"The Game\\", which consists of running English phrases through a compujterized translator to Japanese and then back to English, and then trying to figure out the original phrase from the result.  Absurd, no?  Except that in our modern world, thanks to the wonder of the internet, many folks actually play such games with the Babblefish program, and often with hilarious results.  That's Phillip K Dick for you.  Don't laugh too hard at his notions, because they might get sneaky and come true.	2005-01-25

In \\"Cetaganda\\", however, the balance swings to the humor side.  Miles and his not-exactly-genius cousin Ivan are in the Cetagandan capital as envoys at a funeral for the Emperor's mother.  Their banter is generally plenty witty, no doubt about that.  The problem, rather, is that we get to much of it.  Indeed, one could be forgiven for suspecting that Bujold wrote one major subplot just so that the two Vor lordlings would have a chance to toss yet more zingers at each other.  By contrast, scenes of genuine suspense are toned down compared to earlier books in the series. <br /> <br />Cetagandan society itself is one of Bujold's imaginative triumphs.  The ruling 'haut' class have genetically engineered themselves, not to mentioned their pets and decorative plants, almost to perfection.  However, they spend most of their time hidden behind various social and physical barriers while a 'ghem' class controls the military and does most of the actual governing.  With a few tantalizing and well-scripted scenes, Bujold shows us how the ghems are decaying and hints of societal breakdown are appearing throughout Cetaganda's structure.  For that part, at least, she earns an A+. <br /> <br />In plot coherence, however, \\"Cetaganda\\" comes across as sloppy and poorly planned compared to her other books.  While the villain is finally unmasked with much fanfare at the end, no sensible wrap-up of his evil plan is ever offered.  In retrospect it looks like he was going out of his way to get caught.  The other characters also don't pan out too well.  For instance, on several occasions a group of haut women discuss their top-secret plans for the future of the empire while Miles, who is still ostensibly an enemy, is present and listening in on their conversation.	2005-01-24

People love it, critics laud it, but few can truly say why it's so great.  The story starts with Fitz and Burrich in the mountain kingdom recovering from their injuries at the end of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\".  Fitz flirts with the idea of running off to forge a new life elsewhere, but a Skill dream draws convinces him not to forsake his promise to King Shrewd.  This rapid shifting of Fitz's attitudes keeps up throughout the novel.  And well it should.  Those who are in their middle teens or accurately remember their middle teens know them as years of mental shifting.  You feel desperate and depressed one minute, calm the next, then full of rage.  I can barely name any novel that so captures teenage moodiness and its draining consequences as well as \\"Royal Assassin\\". <br /> <br />In any case, the world will not wait for Fitz to sort out his emotions.  Forged ones converge on Buckkeep, Red Ship Raiders attack in renewed numbers, Prince Regal schemes to overthrow his brother, Molly returns beset with her own emotional storms, and a new wit-bonded wolf puppy demands his attention.  In the midst of all this turmoil, Fitz will have to struggle with his feelings, his loyalties, his priorities, and his relationships. <br /> <br />\\"Royal Assassin\\" defies all expectations.  Like a great jazz improvisation performance, it has its own rhythms, but then takes you on surprising turns that you don't see coming.  Rather than going for the predictable pattern where every event getting neatly wrapped up before the next event begins, here one crisis piles up on top of the next one and the total hits an almost unbearable pitch.  I can't explain it better, I'm afraid, but in the end \\"Royal Assassin\\" is what it is, a top notch epic fantasy about an entire nation convulsing between its own decay and external attack, told entirely through one single unforgettable character.  It never condescends to the reader or grows hubrisitc.  I'm making my second journey through the Farseer trilogy now, and I can say without hesitation that nobody alive does it better than Robin Hobb.	2005-01-18

He revels in darkness and cynicism.  Perhaps it was a result of reading one too many syrupy tales of humanity's joyous rebirth from the ashes of apocalypse, but in \\"Throught Darkest America\\" he sets out to carefully eliminate all vestiges of hope.  The resulting book is brutal, the back cover declaration \\"not for the squeamish\\" is an almost ridiculous understatement.  But for those willing to tough it out, it's also memorable for its unique way of attacking the subject. <br /> <br />Howie, twelve year old at the start, lives in a frontier world centuries after \\"The War\\", where twentieth century technology has vanished.  The whole country is now organized similar to a nineteenth century frontier town, with the government taking levies to support a war somewhere in the West.  With all animals exterminated, food now comes from 'stock', human-like but apparently unthinking creatures raised on farms.  Barrett reinforces this world building by writing the entire book in old fashioned American dialect reminiscient of Mark Twain. <br /> <br />Among its strengths is character development.  Barrett expertly captures the awkward guilt of youthful sexual discovery in a conservative religious culture.  Of course, Howie's peaceful existence eventually gets shattered, his family torn apart, and he sets off on a voyage towards the war zone, encountering life-changing treachery along the way.  Much remains unexplained, with plot threads left dangling, but the point of the story, perhaps, is that in real life much is always left unexplained.  In \\"Through Darkest America\\", it is the journey that matters, not the destination.	2005-01-09
US	41549714	RID2D8ZPEUHBC	0552133256	122436143	Strata	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Early Pratchett	The word \\"quirky\\" gets used a lot in descriptions of \\"Strata\\".  Gee, d'ya think so?  Here we start with Kin Arad explaining to a couple amateurs why burying a dinosaur skeleton holding a sign that says \\"End nuclear testing\\" in a fake cretacious bog for future generations of paleontologists to finds is a bad idea.  Later Kin will join a human transformed into a Kung, which is a really really violent species, and a cannibalistic Shand on a voyage to a huge artificial disc where they get stalked by a raven, employed by Leif Ericson, and almost betrayed by a teleporting demon.  Quirky?  A little. <br /> <br />The principle problem with \\"Strata\\" is that Pratchett seems like he never quite decided what he wanted to do with it.  There are moments that are laugh out loud (a bitter and repressed genie comes to mind), but not nearly as many as you would expect in a real Discworld novel.  And there's a big slab of far-out science fiction adventure, which as others have remarked is much in the vein of Larry Niven.  And there's an ending, which sort of ties together most of what has happened throughout the book, but it's not exactly a knockout.  \\"Strata\\" shows us a young author finding his legs early in his career, with hints of the greatness to come.  Hints, yes, but not that many hints.	2005-01-04

Upon encountering a poorly written book, we frequently respond by labeling it juvenile and immature, and suggesting that we have a six-year-old waiting at home who could do better.  Lately the publishing companies have dsicovered a possibly brilliant way to preempt this insult.  They hire children to write books.  \\"Heresy\\", by Anselm Audley, was written by a teenager.  Moreover, it looks like it was written by a teenager.  And I do not mean that as a compliment.<br /><br />When I myself was an acned adolescent, I began working on a big epic fantasy.  That project now languishes unpublished in my parents' attic, unfinished and unpublished because it contained no real plot.  I was, at the time, more interested in world-building than in telling a story.  In \\"Heresy\\", Anselm Audley has poured his heart into the details.  You'll learn about which countries produce which goods and export them to where, and which religious sects believe what, and which cities have what forms of government.  But as for anything actually happening to catch your attention, forget it.<br /><br />Young Cathon is an orphan boy who, guess what, proves to be the long lost heir to the throne and possessor of whopping magical powers to boot.  Arrayed against him we have a cliche band of evil priests, as well as some nasty traders of some sort from a \\"great house\\".  Characterization flops totally, with Cathan showing barely any personality, and the villains failing to even reach the level comic book stereotype.  Particuarly noxious is Cathan's relationship with a cycle of interchangable love interests, each more smashingly beautiful than the last.  Times change, but teenage boys' sexual fantasies remain quite predictable.<br /><br />Ever heard of space-fillers?  The term gets redefined here.  \\"The garden was specially designed to collect water below the soil and funnel off excess down the storm drains, thus ensuring the extra weight didn't bring the building down every time it rained.\\"  Even accepting the dubious proposition that drainage makes good fiction, I think we could have divined the purpose of the funnel without being told.  After many hundred pages of this, Anselm tacks on a very hasty ending that totally doesn't fit with the rest of the book.  And for writing skill, the lest said the better.  Subordinate clause piles on top of ungainly subordinate clause, and Audley's abuse of the semicolon borders on criminal.<br /><br />So to conclude, \\"Heresy\\" is yet another overhyped, underperforming wannabe in the fantasy field, a further insult to our intelligence from publishing companies that are leaking credibility faster than Donald Rumsfield.  For real fantasy entertainment, may I suggest Memeory, Sorrow, and Thorn by Tad Williams or perhaps \\"The High House\\" by James Stoddard.  These authors actually built their worlds around a story rather than the other way around.  And they are, not coincidentally, adults.cepting the dubious proposition that drainage makes good fiction, I think we could have divined the purpose of the funnel without being told.

US	41549714	R7RZUEATWH542	0312278446	143888033	The Best Short Stories of J. G. Ballard	Books	4	17	19	N	N	The Best Short Stories of J. G. Ballard	I am much displeased to see that the current version of this story collection features such lackluster cover art.  My original copy features a breathtaking portrait of a crowd and some cars in the desert, dwarfed by a towering pink collosus, while hand gliders dots the sky above and an enormous unicorn appears in the clouds.  But what's most amazing is that this isn't just whimsy on the artist's part; it's actually a scene from one of Ballard's stories.  That's the thing about Ballard.  To him the idea that a ragtag but energetic crew of pilots might create enormous sculptures out of clouds in the desrt sky wasn't just possible, it seemed perfectly natural.  His imagination ran to places that most science fiction authors couldn't even conceive, and once there it plopped into an armchair and started spinning a story that readers won't ever forget. <br /> <br />In Ballard's view, the human race is in decline.  It's not because of human weakness or bad political decisions, it's just in the nature of the universe that we'll fade out, and (possibly) make way for something else.  In \\"Concentration City\\", we live in a gigantic metorpolis stretching out in every direction with no open spaces.  One man sets out on a quest to reach the city's edge.  Along the way, he finds troubling signs of encroaching urban decay.  But if nothing other than the city exists, does this spell the end of the world?  In \\"The Deep End\\", technology sets of a chain reaction of unintended consequences, leading to Earth's oceans running dry.  Most people depart for other planets, but one crotchety old-timer insists on staying behind, hoping to protect the world's last fish. <br /> <br />Other stories more directly tackle social issues.  Some folks believe that modern society is too obsessed with schedules and deadlines.  In \\"Chronopolis\\" we respond by outlawing clocks and watches.  But as always there will be rebels who refuse to accept the revolution.  Which side will win in the end?  \\"Billennium\\" takes on overpopulation, while \\"Thirteen for Centaurus\\" looks at scientific ethics while also considering how easy it is to fool people ... or then again maybe not. <br /> <br />Among the most memorable images in this collection is \\"The Drowned Giant\\".  The title is self explanatory: a giant washes up on shore near a major city.  Ballard worries less about where it comes from, more about how we'll react to seeing it.  While the unnamed narrator reflects on the giant's mythological appearance, the body ends up getting chopped up and used as fertilizer, while the bones decorate doorways around the city.  You can try tagging metaphorical meaning to that ending if you wish, but to Ballard it was just one analysis of how modern society functions, which isn't too well.	2004-12-20

Let's face it.  Though in some cases displaying writing skills to stand with the best of them, he never really managed to wrap his head around the idea that  members of this mysterious other gender were actually human beings, capable of their own thoughts, works, and aspirations.  The start of \\"Podkayne of Mars\\" might almost fool you into believing that he intended to redeem himself.  The title character begins as an intelligent, strong-willed, and questioning person. <br /> <br />And then inexplicably morphs into a dumb, submissive pansy.  I am at a loss to guess how Heinlein would justify this reverse character development.  But \\"Poddy\\", who at the start explored and pushed boundaries on her own, soon starts falling into obvious traps and suffering intense inability to put two and two together.  As others have remarked, Heinlein really seems more interested in her kid brother Clark, an evil genius in training.    His exploits provide the few (mildly) entertaining bits of the book. <br /> <br />As for plot, what plot?  More a series of vignettes with a thin thread running through them, we get little to care about here.  The middle is filled with thoughts about the simmering grudges between the hardcore Mars-dwellers and the fat-and-happy denizens of Earth,but Heinlein coveredc that ground to greater effect in \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, or even \\"The Rolling Stones\\".  Then the endings, both of them, roll in with their pointless moralizing about the proper roll of women.  Finally we get a collection of letters from readers complaining about how the original publisher should have allowed Heinlein to use the ending he wanted.  Soory folks, but it takes more than an obnoxious editor to rationalize away this train wreck.	2004-12-13

Onto the scenes strides Tiffany, a nine-year-old would be witch who gradually discovers a sinister plot by the Queen to unleash monsters against her home while abducting her brother Wentworth.  Themewise, \\"The Wee Free Men\\" covers much of the same ground as earlier novels featuring the witches, including the strength of folk wisdom and the importance of self-reliance.  The story celebrates Tiffany use of intelligence (and a well-placed frying pan) rather than magic or physical strength. <br /> <br />Which is what we expect from Pratchett, of course.  But this novel strays from the course in some respects, in ways that are hard to put your finger on.  For one, particularly towards the ending it grows sappy.  Long passages abandon Pratchett's trademark razor wit and go for an emotionaly glurge in Tiffany's moments of self discovery.  And the overall structure of the narrative just jumps around too much, making it hard to keep track of.  We also get discussions of government, class conflict, witch hunts, academics, lawyers, and lots more.  In fact, the story is almost too densely packed this time, and for whatever reason it just doesn't add up to a towering accomplishment.  Try \\"Guards! Guards!\\", \\"Mort\\", or Small Gods\\" instead. <br /> <br />There are, of course, flashes of the trademark Pratchett humor.  The high point, in my humble opinion, are the excerpts from a book of folk remedies for diseases of sheep.  But overall \\"The Wee Free Men\\" simply isn't destined to become a classic.  Great authors must take risks, and if you take risks then by definition a few of your projects must fail.  This books reminds us that even the greatest living fantasy author can't be perfect on every single occasion.  Better luck next time, Terry.	2004-12-04

He wanted a focus on realism.  It was 1970; he asked the authors to envision life in 2020 as it might actually happen, without invading aliens, parallel universes, or other such far out contrivances.  Of course, by doing so he might seem to clamp down on the greatest potential of science fiction, originality.  But a sufficiently skilled author should be able to bend reality and our heads while staying with the bounds of the possible.  Most of these don't, however. <br /> <br />Without any doubt, the top story here is Dian Girad's \\"Eat, Drink, and be Merry\\".  By 2020 we've grown so health conscious that dieting and exercise routines are enforced by law, and computers monitor the citizens nonstop for signs of unhealthiness.  Against this tyranny, one woman wages a humorous battle and achieves a small victory.  (Just please ignore Pournelle's hilariously sexist introduction.) The other flagship story in this collection is Norman Spinrad's \\"A Thing of Beauty\\", a melancholy look at a future where Japanese industrial giants dominate the world and loot the national treasures of other cultures, even America. <br /> <br />Dragging down the collection are the contributions of Harlan Ellison and Poul Anderson, boring Orwell ripoffs with nothing new to say.  Dave McDaniel's \\"Prognosis: Terminal\\" doesn't seem to have much to say either.  Ben Bova's \\"Build me a Mountain\\", a tale about the politics of space exploration, was at elast prophetic in predicting the collapse of support for exploring the planets, though it lacks excitement.  Rounding out the collection is Larry Niven's mediocre speculation on anarchy, \\"Cloak of anarchy\\", and A.E. Van Vogt's \\"Future Perfect\\", where new technology allows the world government to police male sexuality.  He doesn't quite have the guts to push the idea as far as it should go, however.	2004-11-13

Action, adventure, humor, unforseen plot twists, and tough-as-nails characters all compete relentlessly for their share of the book, and will leave your head spinning as you race through the pages.  It all beging when Miles, recently graduated from the Academy, is sent to a temporary position as a weatherman on a dismal island base in the polar regions.  His boss is an alcoholic who predicts storms by smell and his commanding officer is the definition of the word crotchety.  Soon Miles finds himself on an interplanetary mission while juggling three different identities, and then the trouble really starts with an unexpected encounter in a jail in the Hegen Hub. <br /> <br />The action is actually hot and the humor is actually funny.  The characters stay true to their established personalities, and grow in realistic ways.  The only real disappointment is a couple scenes where Bujold tries to build up romantic tension between Miles and a female adversary; those come across as rather weak.  But beyond that, \\"The Vor Game\\" is a classic romp through space that should leave everyone happy.	2004-10-30

In one, a teen genius named Cen does brilliant mathematical work while carrying on a PG-13 relationship with a Hawaiian Princess who died a century before he was born (and they say tragic romance is dead!), while in the other a Japanese scientist and a clone flee from mysterious pursuit and try to acquire some of Chairman Mao's DNA.  This book mentions a lot of scientific hypotheses.  There's the idea that consciousness has a special metaphysical quality in our universe, which is somehow tied to a storyline about a gigantic spaceship being built in Hawaii.  There's mention of potentially deadly nanotechnology, and efforts to analyze and duplicate the past's great leaders through their genes, and...  But what is the meaning of all this?  What consequences does it have for the human race?  Goonan only touches lightly on those questions, with the big ramifications left unexplored. <br /> <br />Besides that, the book just plain lacks style.  Particularly in the second storyline, where the characters flee all over southeast Asia while keeping one step sinister agents, it's all just way too boring.

Twenty-five full-length novels later, he somehow ended up producing highly literate satires with virtually nothing in common with fantasy, except that the occassional troll, vampire, and talking dog does wander through.  In \\"The Truth\\" he turns his eys on the newspaper industry, and the more you know about the curious organization of Britain's print media, the more references you can catch.  But while the news media presents a broad target for satire, a novel of this sort could easily have wandered off course, bashing the most obvious jokes into the ground.  But \\"The Truth\\" doesn't.  It is, after all, written by Terry Pratchett. <br /> <br />William deWorde is the outcast younger son of a wealthy family, who suffered greatly and hilariously at boarding school in his youth.  Through odd circumstances he teams up with the lovely Sacharissa and a band of dwarves to produce a crude newspaper.  In come Lord Vetinari, the Bursar, some trolls, Detrius, and various other friends old and new, and soon hilarious high-jinks are happening all across the city.  To try summarizing the plot would be futile, but suffice to say it will satisfy and long-term Pratchett fan. <br /> <br />Pay attention also to little things.  Over the last twenty-five books, Pratchett's skill has grown at, well, everything.  He now masters such a huge variety of modes of literature that you couldn't even count them all.  Among things to notice in \\"The Truth\\" are non-verbal communication (particularly when Vetinari is on-screen), discussion of the rising middle class, and oh yes, Death.  And I'm sure all find more on my second read.  And my third.  And my fourth.	2004-10-07

To start with, these are short novels, at roughly 150 pages each.  But don't be fooled by the length; there's lots going on here, and little of it predictable.  Certainly no one could honestly claim that they knew how these stories would end right from the start.  With a new twist every ten pages or so, these novels should satisfy fans of authors such as Martha Wells and Patricia McKillip.  This one will keep you on your toes. <br /> <br />In a way that's the problem.  If anything, the Vlad Taltos novels have too much going on.  More specifically it doesn't always add up to a coherent story.  For instance, consider Vlad's miniature dragon sidekick, Loiosh.  The opening chapter tells us how these two first hooked up.  After that, Loiosh doesn't really do much.  Apparently he's intended for comic relief, though I for one didn't find him too relieving.  So why is Loiosh in the book at all?  Likewise with a passage halfway through where Vlad learns that he's actually some sort of ancient emperor reincarnated.  He stews over this info for a few pages and then it's just forgotten and barely mentioned for the rest of the book.  So what was the deal there?  That stuff just doesn't fit with the main plot. <br /> <br />So \\"Jhereg\\" and \\"Yendi\\" are small and speedy novels, but somewhat unorganized.  All things considered I don't recommend this one when so much better fantasy is on the shelf.  Protagonist Vlad himself is decently tough and smart, but Brust never really gives us a reason to cheer for him.  In the end a ruthless assassin defeats another ruthless assassin and humiliates several other ruthless assassins with assistance from a bunch of other ruthless assassins.  And we care ... why?	2004-09-30

Like many who have read or are considering reading \\"Fevre Dream\\", I would not even have looked at it twice if it was written by any other author.  But George R. R. Martin is the man, as they say, and I would gladly read anything he produced. <br /> <br />With that said, \\"Fevre Dream\\" is not your typical Martin novel.  To put it as simply as possible, this book doesn't have the same attitude as his other stuff.  There are no tough-as-nails fighters strutting their hilarious one-liners before entering a fight scene.  \\"Fevre Dream\\" focuses on atmosphere.  While it packs plenty of action, gory fight scenes and dramatic riverboat chaces, the book's reason for existence is the personalities that drive the story.  The main characters dominate every scene, and their conflicts are truly larger than life.  Regrettably, most minor characters are left drifting without much personality. <br /> <br />The writing is mid-range, again below the standard you'd expect from Martin.  At this early point in his career he hadn't yet become a true master of dialogue.  While the exchanges come across as mostly competent and believable, they lack that special zing you'll find in Martin's later books. <br /> <br />As always, Martin does in for details.  I have to applaud him for the tremendous amount of research that must have gone into this work.  For instance, he mentions the Galt House hotel in Louisville, Kentucky, a place where I've actually stayed, and he even gets the color of the roof tiles right.  After finishing \\"Fevre Dream\\", you'll certainly know quite a bit more about life on Mississippi riverboats than you did at the start.  And you'll have read a pretty good story, all things considered.	2004-09-18

A story about a woman coming to terms with her parents' successes and failures, it manages to be touching but not sappy, memorable but not manipulative.  West obviously chose her words and sentences with care, and poured great effort into organizing the tale for maximum effect.  Though I've never read any of her books before, I'll certainly look into them after seeing this story. <br /> <br />Three others stories should be mentioned as at least being worth the time.  \\"Winter Pheonix\\" retells the tale of Princess Anastasia in a new light, and also manages to deliver without getting overtly emotional.  Laura Resnick hits some humorous notes in \\"The Magic Keyboard\\", a story about a young author struggling against writer's block.  And Gary Braunbeck delivers \\"The Hand that Graces\\", a description-defying story of redemption amidst urban blight. <br /> <br />Every collection must have a low point.  Here it's Mel Odom's lengthy, tedious, and ridiculously PC tale of an Indian warrior, \\"Serpent of the Lakes\\".  There are others as well, but they mostly share a similar problem.  The authors don't seem to have any reason driving their creations.  They don't write in a distinctive style, or they fall flat when they try to.  But other than West, no one here seems to really carry the spark that drives great literature, so I have to give this one a thumbs down.	2004-09-07

If that's not an eye-grabbing title, I don't know what is.  Unfortunately, the text within the covers doesn't quite live up to it.  Jonathan Hoag remembers the mornings, and he remembers the evenings, but he doesn't quite remember what he does for a living during the day.  To solve this mystery, he hires two private detectives to tail him and report his movements to him.  The more they try to do so, the more confusing and seemingly impossible phenomenon they encounter.  This novella keeps you reading just to see how Heinlein will wrap up all the contradictions in the end.  Unfortunately, he doesn't.  There is a conclusion that provides some metaphysical food for thought, but it's not really a satisfactory explanation of everything that happened.  \\"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag\\" does boast distinctive characters, and crisp, clean, believable dialogue. <br /> <br />The other flagship story in this collection is \\"And He Built a Crooked House\\".  The story of an architect who won't take no for an answer and a suburban couple who get trapped in one of his designs, this little exercise in cleverness will delight the mathematically minded with its musings on higher dimensions and lower intellects.  The rest is a hodgepodge.  \\"They\\" is an initially intriguing exploration of paranoia, but the ending doesn't punch the way Heinlein wants it to.  \\"Our Fair City\\" is an amusing but not particularly thought-provoking tale about a miniature tornado that gets involved in politics.  \\"All You Zombies\\" is yet another pointless time-travel story. <br /> <br />Lastly there's \\"The Man Who Traveled in Elephants\\".  One of the master's more unusual stories, it explores the life of a quirky elderly couple who travel around attending county fairs.  The point is to suggest that Heaven will be a carnival, complete with cotton candy and a parade of elephants.  With no real science fiction component, it gives us instead an unusual take onfinding your purpose on Earth.  But for some reason I found it strangely unsatisfying in the end.  Regardless, below average Heinlein is still above average fiction.	2004-09-03

I haven't read them all, but this one is certainly a contender.  Introducing the city watch of Ankh-Morpork and a host of delightfully screwy minor characters, this book amply demonstrates Pratchett's talent for cramming different modes of writing into a single story. <br /> <br />It begins when a mysterious character leads a secret society on a mission to summon a dragon as part of a plot to rearrange the city government.  It continues when Carrot, a towering dwarf, arrives to join the watch.  Conflict soon erupts when Carrot attempts to enforce the letter of the law, being the first person in several generations to do so.  Also the Librarian is one the trail of a missing book, a case that he'll eventually solve in most unusual fashion. <br /> <br />In the dragon storyline, Pratchett manages to celebrate and criticize formula fantasy at the same time.  \\"Guards! Guards!\\" also delivers pointed commentary on law enforcement, politics and the type of people who become politicians, hobbyists, angry mobs, the literary community (look for a hilarious footnote on the eccentricities of bookstore owners), and much more.  And he includes some darn fine comedy, especially in the first half.  In some later books such as \\"Feet of Clay\\" he tries to do too much and occasionally loses some threads of the story.  But in \\"Guards! Guards!\\", the world's greatest literary juggler manages to keep exactly the right number of balls in the air for the whole time.  The result is a delight to read.	2004-08-27

This little collection, considered to be one of his minor works, packs more creativity than most authors display in their entire career.  For instance, in the story \\"Goldfish Bowl\\" Heinlein completely reinvents the human race's role on planet Earth, to quite scary effect.  That's one that you won't stop thinking about anytime soon once you've read it. <br /> <br />In \\"By his Bootstraps\\" we read about a fellow who gets caught in a mysterious series of events involving other versions of himself time-traveling from the future.  Contrary to some claims, Heinlein did not actually invent this concpet.  What he does do here is to cook up an incredibly inventive, clever, and humorous plot for the story.  He does a particularly good job handling the psychologoical state of the narrator as the stream of bizarre revelations comes in. <br /> <br />While the other stories may not break your head quite as totally as those two, they are all memorable.  \\"Water is for Washing\\", the closing entry, has some quite memorable imagery.  So, for that matter, does \\"The Menace from Earth\\", a tale of teenage angst and ambition on the Moon.  Overall, I give this collection of stories a hearty recommendation.	2004-08-07

The philosophy that McKillip used when writing this book is almost the opposite of what many of today's authors do.  Here the plot is the central thing, and nothing gets included unless it contributes to the central story about Morgon's travels and his struggle to unravel the mysteries of his world.  No time is wasted on character development scenes or on long descriptions.  The story practically flies from one event to the next.  Consequently, despite being only 200 pages long, you get more plot from this book than from certain 800-page stinkers I could name.<br />So what's it about.  Well, a Prince named Morgon lives in his peaceful island kingdom after recently wining a crown in a riddle-contest.  He travels to the mainland to claim his prize, a marriage to a princess, but more than a few surprises are in store when he gets there.  There's lots more twists and turns before the big shock at the end, but why should I spoil it for you.  \\"The Riddle Master of Hed\\" may disappoint those who want in-depth character development, but it will delight anyone who loves puzzles, surprises, and originality.	2004-07-10

They are, in fact, the best part.  We meet a huge cast of realistic and memorable characters and get some tantalizing hints about armies on the move and conspiracies working behind the scenes.  I do not find protagonist Simon to be an irritating or stereotypical character.  In fact, within the field of fantasy, he's one of the best portraits of the conflicts and turbulence of adolescence.  The opening section of the book contains some heartfelt looks at big topics on top of great writing and memorable imagery.<br />It is the ponderous middle section, rather, where the real problem lies.  Simon goes on the run with a comic relief sidekick who just isn't very relieving.  This is basically formula fantasy, as legions of bad guys attack only to be easily batted off by the enterprising good guys.  The writing here is lower quality than at the beginning, as if Tad Williams was bored by this part of the book and was rushing through to reach the end.<br />And sure enough, things do pick up in the home stretch.  There are a few surprises waiting in the final chapters, and enough decent action sequences to satisfy.  Overall, I would say that &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; isn't quite as good as the works of George R R Martin or Robin Hobb, but it is a major achievement that brought new depth and dimension to the fantasy field.  Read it to enjoy and don't get thrown off by the slow parts.	2004-07-01

I know that it is considered a fantasy classic, that thousands of fans adore it, and that Kay is one of the genre's all-time greats.  But &quot;The Summer Tree&quot; just doesn't have it.  Oh sure the writing is competent and the characters are above average but the overall work doesn't add up to anything.  It's a hodepodge of elements collected from elsewhere that never justifies its own existence.<br />Just look at the fight scenes.  Bad guy sends thousands of incompetent minions into battle.  Good guys fearlessly march out to meet them.  Despite being pompous fools who are vastly outnumbered, good guys somehow win without getting a scratch.  Sound familiar?  Maybe that's because we've already seen this happen thousands of times in countless other fantasy novels.  Any good guy who's ever in danger gets rescued by a last-second magic trick.  And some claim that the dialogue in this book is special.  Not so.  For instance, head villain Rakoth sounds so much like a comic book cliche bad guy that I almost laughed out loud.<br />Which isn't to say that the book is entirely bad.  Some scenes, such as a character's internal reflections on a past incident during a moment of self-sacrifice do strike a genuine emotional chord.  It's interesting to note that Kay's better works are the ones that focus on smaller personal stories rather than grandiose struggles between good and evil.  Perhaps he should have skipped this trilogy entirely and gone straight to his later novels.  Certainly Tolkien and Donaldson, among others, have done far better at classical fantasy than this freshman effort.	2004-05-30

They see a lot of landscapes and havea couple encounters with poorly described little furry creatures.  And that's about it.  Yes, the central problem with this book is that it lacks purpose.  Although billed as a story about self-discovery, none of the main characters really catch your attention.  As far as imagination goes, this book is seriously lacking.  It's just too long and boring to justify reading it, despite one decent action sequence.<br />I might say that Engh's dialogue is wooden, but I don't want to insult wood.  The writing is just awful most of the time, with the characters simply pouring forththeir emotions and thought processes.  It doesn't ever sound the slightest bit like real dialogue.  Avoid this one, folks, cause there's nothing to see here.	2004-05-27

In this book she just doesn't.  To qualify that, &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot; introduces us to Miles Vorkosigan, the handicapped son of Cordelia Naismith and Lord Vorkosigan.  At the start, an instantaneous misstep ruins Miles' hopes for a military career on Barrayar.  As a consolation, he gets a vacation back to Beta Colony.  An odd series of events leads to him buying a space ship, recruiting a crew, and undertaking to run a blockade into a war zone.  Then the silliness begins.<br />The backbone of the story is how Miles overcomes his disability to provide strong leadership, and inspire others along the way.  A worthy theme, to be sure, but Bujold orchestrates it in a preposterous way.  It works like this: Miles and his band of wacky misfits take on one spaceship of soldiers and wins handily.  Then he tricks all the defeated soldiers into joining his side.  Then he uses his new, larger band of wacky misfits to beat up a larger group of soldiers.  Then all those people agree to join his side.  Repeat this several times, and all of a sudden Miles not only controls a solar system, but also has high self-esteem.  Now none of his opponents ever seem to consider seriously fighting back, and furthermore you'd have to be pretty dumb to fall for some of the tricks that he uses.<br />In Bujold's defense, I can say that she does a decent job with characters, although not as good as scifi greats such as Donaldson's Gap Saga.  Miles and his merry men for the most part feel genuine and at least a little bit gritty, if not incredibly deep.  But a solid novel needs both good characters and good plot, and it's too bad that Bujold dropped half the ball on this one.	2004-05-08

More Pratchett!  &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; sports a heftier page count than earlier Discworld novels, but our man uses the space well.  The signs are ominous.  Crop circles are appearing everywhere, including in Ridicully's hair.  Bratty teenage witches are defying authority.  Cold winds are blowing around that circle of gigantic stones.  Granny Weatherwax knows it can only mean one thing.  The Elves are coming.  Not the Elves that most fantasy fans are familiar with.  These Elves are based on the depictions in classic fairy tales and other traditional sources.  They are not nice.  And it will take quite a collection of strengths and talents to defeat them.<br />Although it starts slowly, &quot;Lord and Ladies&quot; soon builds into one of the best Discworld novels.  There's humor aplenty here, in enough varieties to satisfy anybody.  There also a huge cast of characters, and the interplay between them is handled expertly.  Even concepts that sound too farfetched, such as the great dwarf lover Casanunda, somehow get integrated into the story successfully.  Throw in generational conflict, heavy Shakespeare allusions, lots of wordplay, and some rousing actions scenes, and you've got one of Mr. Pratchett's finest achievements.	2004-04-30

Karan and Llian are our girl-and-boy pair on the run, desperately trying to prevent various villains from getting the magic thingamajig - a mirror in this particular case.  Meanwhile, a bevy of senior wizards and sorceresses are still trying to resolve some dispute that dates back thousands of years, though you'll have to shell out for the sequel to find out what it is.<br />In truth, the plotting of this is reasonably good.  It's the characters that are the problem.  Karan is either a portrait of schizophrenia or else Irvine couldn't decide what personality he wanted for her.  Sometimes she's bold and leaderlike, other times she's timid and depressed.  Llian at first seems like he might be worth reading about, as he gets thrown out of school and forced to struggle with some incorrect assumptions he had made.  Unfortunately this never really pans out, and he soon turns into a standard-issue hero.  Minor characters don't improve the situation much.<br />And then there's the writing.  All of our characters seem to have studied at the comic book school of speech technique.  Stock lines such as &quot;I feel like we're being watched&quot; and &quot;What you need to know I will tell you in good time&quot; pop up everywhere.  Major violations of the 'show, don't tell rule', unsubtle foreshadowing (Karan keeps announcing that &quot;Great woe will come of it&quot;), poor pictures of emotions, lame action scenes ...<br />&quot;A Shadow on the Glass&quot; is not a total disaster.  It does at least feature a big and complicated story that's not wholly predictable.  But in the final analysis, there's no there there.  There's no reason to keep plowing through it when you can't care about any of the characters.  Aspect Fantasy, home to some of the best authors discovered in the past few years, has never let me down before, but any way you slice it there's no excusing this turkey.	2004-04-25

This is both a good thing and a bad thing.  Our character offerings this time are an evil inquisitor named Vorbis, a meek apprentice named Brutha, and their almighty God Om, here incarnated as a powerless tortoise.  Religion is the subject of the first half of the book, as we get lots of jokes about the evils of oppressive theocracy of medieval mindsets.  I don't mind humor on this topic; the problem lies more in Pratchett's lack of originality.  The jokes are mostly old ones, with a distinctly dreary feel.  Pratchett's humor works better in the conversations between Brutha and Om, where the 'logic' of religion clashes with the oddness of having a god who's a small tortoise to produce some bizarre results.<br />Brutha: That's Blasphemy!<BR>Om: I can't blaspheme, I'm a God.<br />or<br />Om: Somebody up there likes me.  It's me, of course.<br />Luckily, the boring religious passages flow by fast enough that they don't really weigh the book down, and things pick up once we move to the city of Ephebe, where robed philosophers clash over metaphysics and Om tries to earn a living via geometric skill.  The ending is everything we've come to expect from a Pratchett ending.  So while &quot;Small Gods&quot; may not be Discworld's high watermark, it's still well worth checking out.	2004-04-09

To be respectable, you have to know the limits, to know the formula for building a solid plot and believable characters, and the ways to write good sentences and paragraphs.  Rules, however, can only take you so far.  To move from good to great, you have to learn how to break the rules.<br />China Miéville breaks all the rules.  He abandons his two main plotlines a third of the way through the book and switches to focus on something that had been tangential up to that point.  His characters resist all attempts at pigeonholing, continuously twisting away from set personalities and defying expectations.  Groups and concepts drift into and out of the book without explanation.  There is no Disney ending, no syrupy love stories, no clichés, and no easy solutions or last-minute quick fixes.  This is genuine writing, more raw and gritty than any other fantasy that you're likely to find.<br />In the city of New Crozubon, humans, remades, khepri (women with scarabs on their heads), and many other races all coexist peacefully, if somewhat nervously.  Isaac is a scientist, recently exiled from academia, who takes on a commission from a most unusual client.  His khepri artist girlfriend does the same.  Throw in some drug dealers, rogue publishers, unionized frog people, organized disembodied hands, a sentient vacuum cleaner, a giant trans-dimensional spider who likes scissors, a blimp-riding militia, walking cacti, an enormous drug-addicted caterpillar, and the ambassador of Hell, and you've got the recipe for an original, massive, intriguing, and dare we say it, epic, story.

The story rotates (har har) around a group of scientists and international men of mystery stranded on the moon after a nasty alien named Wheeler destroys the Earth and kills most of the human race.  They spend their time hunting for new sources of oxygen and working on new whatsits.  If any of them feels lost, guilty, or afraid after the near-extermination of their species, they keep it well hidden.  Indeed, characterization is the weakest point in this book.  Other than protagonist Jack Potter, there's zero depth.  For instance, sidekick Kamal is your comic-strip stereotype of a Buddhist, offering up platitudes and metaphors while apparently having no thoughts or feelings of his own.<br />True to its word, the plot does move pretty quickly, and you never have to wait too long for something to happen.  However, that's about the only positive thing I can find to say about this book.  As always, computer whizzes clash in a virtual world where elaborate action sequences are presented for our benefit.  However, &quot;A Signal Shattered&quot; never comes close to matching the intensity of greats like &quot;Neuromancer&quot; or &quot;Hyperion&quot;.  There's also the problem that you can shoot Nylund's characters, stab them, poison them, blow them up, and apply weird genetic tricks to them, but they simply won't die.  This removes much of the suspense.  Jack's hunches also undermine the book's intrigues.  He gets a hunch about what almost every character is up to, and they always prove correct.  Well I've got a hunch that I won't be reading any more of Nylund's books any time soon.	2004-03-31

Some people list the books as great masterpieces, while others merely find them languid and annoying.  I place myself solidly in the pro camp.  However, I feel that Robinson should have quit while he was ahead.<br />&quot;The Martians&quot; is a collection of short stories set at various stages during the overall arch of the trilogy.  Robinson's main strengths are still here: scientific rigor and some excellent descriptions of the landscape of Mars both before and after terraforming.  He uses different narrative styles for each story, and some work better than others.  The high point is a novella-length narrative about a mountain-climbing expedition.  On the other end of the scale, some shorter stories and a collection of poems at the end don't score so highly with me.  But the big problem I have with this book is that it doesn't really add anything to the trilogy as a whole.  &quot;The Martians&quot; seems more like a collection of vaguely interesting ideas that just didn't fit neatly into any of the three novels.  As a separate collection, however, they don't come close to being as thought-provoking as the originals.	2004-03-23

The gimmick, of course, is that Death is a main character in this book.  Growing tired of his job, he takes on a young boy named Mort as an apprentice.  The arrangement isn't perfect, however, as Mort still experiences emotions that are entirely foreign to Death.  This leads Death on a quest to gain understanding of the human concept of fun, while Mort runs into certain problems during his first attempt at the job.  The situations looks to be spiraling out of control, but everything comes together in an absolutely brilliant climax.<br />Like many folks, I've spent years listening to friends and critics hail Pratchett's genius nonstop.  I finally bowed to peer pressure and dove into his body of work, starting with &quot;The Color of Magic&quot;, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, and &quot;Equal Rites&quot;.  Now those are all fine books with lots of big laughs, but they didn't quite justify the endless claims of Pratchett being one of the great fantasy authors of all time.  &quot;Mort&quot; does.  The first two Discworld novels were straight-up farce, and &quot;Equal Rites&quot; seemed a bit uncomfortable with its serious themes.  &quot;Mort&quot;, however, shifts solidly into character-driven humor.  The jokes come not entirely from ludicrous diversions, but rather from watching the personalities in the story bounce off each other.  And through it all, Pratchett never forgets the subject matter that he's dealing with.  He makes good use of the concept of Death.<br />With that said, &quot;Mort&quot; is just plain hilarious.  I've remarked before how Pratchett has an almost unique gift for choosing words and sentences for maximum effect.  In this respect, he just gets better and better with each book.  One example from &quot;Mort&quot; that sticks out in my mind is a scene where Mort encounters three thugs in the streets of Ankh-Morpork.  First, the author is aware of and plays with formula fantasy conventions.  But more importantly, the way that he cuts between different perspectives while telling the story and constructs each sentence with care brings out maximum comic effect.  It's so brilliant, I could read twenty more of these novels.  Matter of fact, I think I will.	2004-03-20

First we view it as a farce, just like Pratchett's first two Discworld novels.  Second, we can view it as an honest story about a girl's coming of age.  Thirdly, we can view it as a sophisticated parody of fantasy conventions.  But any way you slice it, &quot;Rites&quot; works pretty well.  This is the start of Pratchett's rise from screwball comedy to literary greatness.<br />His talent shines forth in the careful blending of the three different approaches to telling the story.  There will be long patches of apparently serious prose, during which we see the interaction between the little girl Esk and Granny Weatherwax.  Then, right when you least expect it, Pratchett gets you with a killer punchline.  I think that my favorite moment is when Granny Weatherwax launches a diatribe against the wizard's staff that symbolically divides her from her pupil, after which the omnipresent narrator comments: &quot;The staff regarded her woodenly.&quot;  He he.  Is it any wonder this guy is the second best-selling author in British history?  Also of note is Pratchett's clever word choices and bizarre imagery.  In one scene in the library where the books escape, the narrator notes &quot;a flock of thesauruses&quot; flying past.	2004-03-09

Given this profusion of overhyped, underwhelming crap, it's understandable that many readers might be skeptical of a newcomer fantasy author touted as a grandmaster.  This time, however, there's no need.  The claims are true, the talent is real, the result is stunning.<br />&quot;Prince of Ayodhya&quot; is, of course, an epic fantasy set in ancient India.  It follows Maharaja Dasaratha, ruler of the mighty Kingdom of Ayodhya, and his three wives and four sons as they receive disturbing news from the seer Vishwamitra: the Demon Lord Ravana has been gathering an army of hellish beings in preparation for an assault on the mortal plain.  The cast here is huge, but Ashok Banker juggles his characters well.  Virtually all of them take on the larger-than-life personalities of epic heroes and villains, leaving an unforgettable stamp on the story rather than just going through the motions.  One reviewer complained that the characters were too simplistic.  It may seem that way at the start, but new layers of complexity unfold as the story progresses.<br />The best way to describe this book is to say that Banker gives his tale the scope of an epic.  This is a story not just about big characters, but about big cities, big journeys, big armies, big battles, and a promise of even bigger events to come.  Here we actually see not just a few people, but instead an entire nation being drawn into an expanding battle.  This author has also mastered the little details of writing.  His ability to evoke setting and mood through little details of sight, sound, and smell matches the best in the genre.  His handling of pacing matches his talent at writing.  There's never a slow moment in this book, and characterdevelopment scenes are woven into the narrative so well that they fit perfectly.<br />Is this book perfect?  No.  Banker does have a few problems, such as an obsession with putting somewhat cheesy cliffhangers at the end of every single chapter and some chapters that are too short and choppy.  But these are minor mistakes that barely put a dent in such a tremendous accomplishment.  Overall, I give &quot;Prince of Ayodhya&quot; a hearty recommendation, and I can't wait for &quot;Siege of Mithila&quot;.	2004-03-03

It focuses, at great length, on extreme suffering, pain, depression, isolation, defeat, violence, and insanity.  Stephen R. Donaldson, of course, has never run away from aggressively dark and vicious literature.  Even by his standards, however, &quot;The Gap into Power&quot; still stands out.  This novel is frequently unpleasant, sometimes even painful to read.  But those who have the guts to get through it will find a masterpiece waiting in here.  This is no ordinary science fiction experience.<br />Nick Succurso recaptures Morn Hyland and reaches Thanatos Minor.  But once there, he finds himself short on allies and facing a most unpleasant surprise.  Angus Thermopylae travels through space, heading for the exact same outlaw's hangout, his brain still controlled by UMCP computers.  Unpredictable developments are in store for him as well, however.  Meanwhile, back on Earth, the political situation approaches boiling point, as every player tries to outmaneuver the others and emerge from the scenario on top.  This truly is one of the most far-reaching and intricate plots of all time.  Not a cheesy setup where you can see all the twists and turns coming far in advance.  Here everything is up in the air.  You actually have to think about what each person is trying to accomplish, and more importantly, about which ones are actually good and which are evil.<br />But behind all this, Donaldson is actually telling us something.  He is showing us not just how technology changes the human experience, but how humans themselves will change the shape of the future.  The characters we see, Nick Succurso, Angus Thermopylae, Holt Frasner, the Bill and all the rest, live in a world where morality is completely gone.  In its place, these characters let their most raw emotions dominate them entirely, with no considerations for what is morally acceptable.  Indeed, most of them don't seem to believe that there is any difference between right and wrong.  And it is to show us the consequences of such beliefs, especially to those who hold them, that Donaldson delves into such brutal and painful detail regarding what happens in the story.  The scenes of suffering and torture, even the ones that aren't strictly relevant to the plot, are not gratuitous.  They make us understand the true meaning of what we are seeing.  &quot;The Gap into Power&quot; is not a story for children, nor is it for squeamish adults.  But for those willing to take it on, it is one of the most rewarding science fiction novels ever.	2004-02-25

There's plenty of action, characters to cheer for, and some nice twists and turns throughout.  Our heroine is Cordelia Naismith, a scientist from the stiflingly modern Beta Colony, who gets caught up in a complex web of strategy and betrayal during a war with a comparably primitive planet and repeatedly finds herself thrown together with Commander Vorkosigan.<br />I find little to say about these two novels.  For sure, Bujold coordinates her plot well, with clever surprises arriving on a regular basis and all of it building up to a comprehensive and rather grim picture of the societies involved.  Character development is relatively strong, as we get good portraits of emotional intensity from both the main characters throughout the book.  I think that most of the dialogue exchanges are handled well, with occasional dashes of humor.  The villains, on the other hand, are so underdeveloped that they might as well have twirling black mustaches.  Fine entertainment overall, much recommended, but not perfect.	2004-02-22
US	41549714	R681PB8D2WOG5	1592220053	994399065	Tuf Voyaging	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Good Stuff	Like many people who have recently read &quot;Tuf Voyaging&quot; for the first time, I was introduced to George R. R. Martin through the outstanding &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series.  &quot;Tuf&quot;, of course, has a very different setting.  In the far future, humanity lives on scattered planets long after the collapse of the Empire.  One relic survives: a 'Seedship', containing all the ancient data and technology needed to clone extinct species or create new ones.  This ship falls into the hands of a trader named Haviland Tuf, who promptly sets off on a series of adventures, using the ship's capabilities to address ecological and societal problems on various planets.<br />Although this is certainly early Martin, I would argue that we can definitely see the same qualities here that we love in his current set of fantasy triumphs.  Characters stand out for their strong personalities and unshakable convictions.  Tuf, portrayed as intelligent and self-confident but still holding a sense of humor, embodies the same strength and likeability that we find in Tyrion Lannister and other unforgettable creations.  As in the &quot;Song&quot;, minor characters are also well-developed in the space of just a few lines, creating genuine emotional intensity as they vie against Tuf.  I should mention also that the humor is strong.  Things that are supposed to be funny actually are funny.<br />The best story of the bunch is &quot;The Plague Star&quot;, the opening chapter in which we see how Tuf acquires his ship and grow introduced to his tough but patient personality.  This one is a minor masterpiece that pitches an entire crew into an every-man-for-himself battle where nobody can be trusted. (Petyr Baelish and Varys would feel right at home.)  As with his later fantasy novels, Martin toys with the reader.  He sets up situations where you think you can predict what will happen, but keeps some tricks up his sleeve until the last minute.  Slightly less enchanting, but still definitely worth reading, are three stories where Tuf helps a crowded planet deal with overpopulation.  I didn't find these tales excessively preachy, but there was certainly less action there than what I've come to expect from Martin.	2004-02-14
US	41549714	ROHORFATWXJLL	0553297600	676908979	Forbidden Knowledge: The Gap into Vision (The Gap, Book 2)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Brilliant	There are two things that Stephen R. Donaldson always does remarkably well.  The first is character.  His people, be they heroes, antiheroes, villains, winners, losers, manipulators, or manipulated, are boldly drawn and astonishingly real.  A Donaldson character does not blend into the background and become indistinguishable from dozens of others you've read.  These people stick around inside your head, awing you with their overwhelming personalities long after you've finished the book.  His other great talent is for conflict.  Having set up two titanic personas, he then sets them against each other.  The result is amazing to see.<br />I'm pleased to report that both of these talents are on full display in &quot;The Gap into vision: Forbidden Knowledge&quot;.  The personalities this time around are Morn Hyland and Nick Succurso.  Morn, seen earlier almost entirely as a victim, comes into her own as a dynamic and strong-willed person.  In &quot;Forbidden Knowledge&quot;, she draws on a staggering amount of tenacity and courage to continue fighting for what she needs against all odds.  Nick, for his part, gives us previously unrevealed levels of depth as he struggles to keep control of his ship and his crew.  When these two come into conflict, the result is breathtaking to see, one of the best character duels ever written in imaginative fiction.<br />And that's not all.  While those two battle the twists of fate and each other, Angus Thermopylae is caught in a different web of intrigue.  Furthermore, the plot and the universe keep expanding.  Like many Donaldson fans, I found &quot;The Real Story&quot; entertaining but mildly disappointing, partly because the future world we saw there seemed somewhat cliché.  Well, suffice to say that I can lodge no such complaint against &quot;Forbidden Knowledge&quot;.  The story leaps suddenly from being small and simple to being complex and epic.  The Amnion who reside in 'Forbidden Space', a topic barely mentioned in the first book, come fully into the picture now.  Through brief snippets of past history and a few suggestions of multi-layered conspiracies lurking beneath the surface, we start to see that Donaldson is developing a bigger picture.  This book, in short, is awesome.	2004-02-08

It is your fault, of course, but there's little you can do about that.  Wisdom comes easily to the man who's waiting for the axeman's blade to fall.  For the first time in his life, he knows exactly where he's going next.&quot;<br />This quote, uttered by an argumentative mechanical lizard named Julia Jessica Slagg, exemplifies &quot;The Prophecy Machine&quot;.  Neil Barrett Jr. wrote two of these delightful comic fantasy novels.  I read the sequel, &quot;The Treachery of Kings&quot;, last year, and found it to be one of the most brilliant and eccentric novels I'd ever read.  I'm actually a little bit less enchanted with &quot;The Prophecy Machine&quot;, but it's still a quite impressive achievement.<br />Master lizard-maker Finn and his lovely wife Letitia Louise are trying to take a vacation, but an unfortunate set of circumstances strands them in the land of Makasar.  Along with them is the aforementioned mechanical lizard, a creature named Julia Jessica Slagg, with a sharp tongue.  This odd trio makes for one of the most entertaining sets of relationships in imaginative fiction.  The dialogue they trade, and the subtle interplay of their personalities, is delightful.  Barrett's intuition for comic timing is amazing, and his dark, cynical sense of humor cuts through all pretense.<br />Now I could go into a further plot summary, but I think I'll let you discover all the clever parts of this book for yourself.  Barrett's name is not widely recognized, even among fantasy geeks, but the same could be said of many today's most talented writers.  After &quot;The Prophecy Machine&quot; and &quot;The Treachery of Kings&quot;, he certainly deserves to enjoy the same fame as Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett.	2004-02-05

The premise of \\"Ella Enchanted\\", as you can read from the jacket or any of the other reviews here, goes like this: a young girl named Ella gets an unfortunate gift from a nice but incompetent fairy named Lucinda.  Ella is magically forced to follow any command that anyone gives her.  We then follow poor Ella as her mother dies, she gets sent off to finishing school, runs away, has a series of misadventures, returns home, gets sent off again, and finally marries the Prince and lives happily ever after.<br />Now in my mind, this book is a missed opportunity.  Thinking about the idea behind this book, you could probably come up with plenty of good jokes that could be made with it.  \\"Ella Enchanted\\" does have a few funny moments, such as when a parrot keeps interrupting Ella's attempts to bake a cake, but on the whole it's not enough.  Much of the book is spent watching Ella get tormented by evil stepsister Hattie.  And while it's all done competently and Ella's revenge at the end is perfectly satisfactory, I found the book as a whole to be less uplifting than it might be.  So in short, \\"Ella Enchanted\\" is readable, but not destined to become a children's classic by any measure.	2004-02-03
US	41549714	R13T63V59D0BOQ	0553295098	110431666	The Real Story: The Gap into Conflict (The Gap Cycle)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Start of a Good series	One way to distinguish between good and bad authors is to examine the breadth of their career.  Lesser authors often do one thing and then repeat themselves endlessly.  Truly great authors take on a variety of projects, challenging themselves by seeking out new stories.  Like most people, I was first introduced to Stephen R. Donaldson by the first Thomas Covenant trilogy, and I sort of expected &quot;The Real Story&quot; to be something similar only this time in a science fiction setting.  Was I ever proven wrong.  This little novel is a completely different animal, one that tackles different issues than the Thomas Covenant books and uses different strategies.<br />The story takes place at some point in the future in DelSec, a region of space where police hired by the United Mining Company exercise only limited control.  The events described on the jacket cover all take place within the first few pages; the majority of the book is spent returning and going over those events once again from the perspective of one character, thus letting us actually understand motivations and details.  One notable aspect of the story is the incredibly fast pacing, with at least one new twist arriving every ten pages.  In contrast to the Covenant series, &quot;The Real Story&quot; uses direct and unsophisticated language, quite appropriate for the direct and intense emotions that dominate the story.<br />Character, of course, is at the heart of any great novel.  Friends have complained that they can't understand the behavior of Donaldson's characters, and the above Publisher's Weekly review insists that they act irrationally.  They're right.  Real human beings, needless to say, are irrational and frequently difficult to understand.  Donaldson has obviously studied our species carefully, and noted the ways in which guilt and fear play out inside people's heads.  There are occasions in &quot;The Real Story&quot; where characters act counterintuitively, just as in real life, but there's always an explanation for it if you look carefully enough.<br />I cannot crown &quot;The Real Story&quot; as the greatest science fiction novel of all time.  It has some odd lapses in common sense.  For instance, one character sneaks into an enemy spaceship from the outside.  Has this futuristic society somehow forgotten the concept of locked doors?  More significantly, it fails to build up that amazing force that you find at the endings of each book in the Covenant trilogy, and it isn't as compulsively readable.  However, I can still recommend this book highly, and praise the authors for trying his hardest to break free from conventions in a world where cliché and formula often rule the day.	2004-02-01

Many historians, including some who are quite intelligent and qualified, lack the talent for writing readable prose, so their works frequently prove inaccessible to a wider audience.  On the other hand, many of the most popular and widely read history books are not, by traditional standards, 'good' history books based on solid research.  Stephen Nissenbaum's &quot;The Battle for Christmas&quot; manages to bridge the gap by presenting solid historical research in an easy to understand way.<br />Roughly, the book covers how the Christmas holiday was experienced by ordinary people in the United States, mostly focusing on the nineteenth century.  After an introductory chapter covering the Puritans' somewhat surprising attitude towards the holiday, we get chapters that look individually at various different traditions, such as gift giving, and at various regions of the country.  Nissenbaum's major thesis is that our concept of a traditional family Christmas was actually invented around the 1820's, an action that corresponds with the rise of the middle class.  He backs this up with a fearsome array of evidence, including personal letters, newspaper articles, and advertisements.  However, the text is not merely a recitation of facts and data.  Nissenbaum organizes it into a type of narrative, letting us clearly see the progression through time as people's attitudes towards Christmas changed.  In addition, he provides detailed portraits of some individuals who played key roles in defining a new type of Christmas, thus making it easier to understand how social trends actually affected people's lives.  After reading &quot;The Battle for Christmas&quot;, you'll feel like you know people such as Clement Clarke Moore, the author of &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;.	2004-01-25

This is the one of the most fast-paced, unpredictable, and exciting books ever written in any genre.  The hero Nicholas is a thief in the Victorian-era city of Vienne.  He and his gang of associates are working on a complex plot to bring down Rive Montesq, the criminal overlord who killed Nicholas' foster father.  However, in this story little ever goes as planned.  For instance, during the very first chapter, our heroes attempt a carefully organized robbery of a noble house during a party, but things go awry because some other seemingly supernatural force want to carry out a robbery in the same house on the same night.  Virtually every plot event in the book has a twist of that sort, thus keeping you truly on your toes for the length of the book.<br />And how 'bout those characters, eh.  Like George R. R. Martin, Wells has the ability to sketch unforgettable personalities in just a few strokes, rather than wasting long passages on character development.  Her characters are suave, confident, and sexy, while at the same time being unquestionably real.  For instance, leading lady Madeleine is a famous actress, and her experience in the theatre helps her work with disguises and assume different roles as she navigates the intrigues of Vienne.  The relationship between Nicholas and Madeleine isn't a typical fantasy coupling where the characters swoon for each other and never experience any problems.  It is, rather, and real relationship, complete with bickering and arguments, but there's real love there as well.  Wells does a magnificient job with the minor characters as well.  I particularly like how Reynard, who is gay, isn't treated as some sort of joke or curiosity, but rather as a three-dimensional human character.<br />Let's all hail Wells for getting the details right.  Descriptions are short and effect, infodumps are nowhere to be found.  Martha Wells understands that the reader doesn't need lengthy lectures, and that supernatural elements are actually more creepily effective if they aren't fully explained.  Dialogue is sharp, and lines that are supposed to be funny actually are funny.  Fantasy, you see, need not be entirely ponderous multi-thousand page bricks of clichéd characters and trite sayings.  It is, in fact, possible to have fun with imaginative novels.  And though the number of authors with the courage to do so may be small, that can't stop us from enjoying books like \\"The Death of the Necromancer\\" when we find them.	2004-01-19

To some extent, it is, right down to women who fold their arms under their breasts and say \\"Men!\\" in exasperated voices.  However, such an analysis misses many things that Mitchell Graham does right.  Most notably, when Mathew Lewin and his friends have to flee their rustic little down with a hoard of bad guys on their tail, they actually act like real teenagers.  They experience nervousness, confusion, homesickness, and their relationships have ups and downs just like in real life.  In that sense, at least, Graham is already better than Jordan.  His plotting is not as bad as some people have suggested.  Somewhere in the rulebook of formula fantasy, it says that the hero's father must die or be taken out of commission during the first few chapters.  Sure enough, Mathew's dad meets an untimely demise right on schedule, but the way that it happens is at least somewhat unexpected.<br />Though better than many standard fantasies, \\"The Fifth Ring\\" is not without certain flaws.  The opening chapter consists merely of a character mentally reciting an infodump for our benefit.  In fact, archbaddie Karas Duren turns out to be a total wash, and the chapters told from his perspective are a waste of time.  Furthermore, the \\"all manner of hellish abomination\\" mentioned on the back cover turns to be just some lame orc wannabees named \\"orlocks\\".  There are continuity issues too.  Character often travel hundreds of miles in a single day, quite a feat in a society with only medieval technology, and entire armies inexplicably cross the entire map without being noticed by their opponents.<br />Writing is a mixed bag.  There are some good passages where the characters' emotions feel genuine and the dialogue rings true, and even a few good jokes along the way.  On the other hand, we also get endless streams of clichés.  It seems like every five minutes, a character has a bad feeling in the pit of their stomach, feelsa chill run up their spine, or wonders whether to believe their ears.  So in short, \\"The Fifth Ring\\" is worthy of neither the ringing accolades handed out by some fantasy fans nor the scathing criticism dished up by the others.  But it is a book that shows promise.  If Graham does clean up his writing style and work on developing decent villains, might he actually go on to be one of the major fantasy authors of this generation?  Stranger things have happened.  This guy bears watching.	2004-01-19

A couple weeks ago, I was talking with a friend and we both complained about how there are so few fantasy novels with good portraits of family life.  Then I went to the library and found \\"Children of the Shaman\\".  Thankfully, newcomer Jessica Rydill decided to focus on character-driven fantasy.  The story involves two children, Annat and Malchik, who have been raised by their aunt but are now going to join their estanged father, who has just taken a new position in a town to the far north.  The level of control and sophistication in the character development is quite impressive.  Clearly Rydill understands that interesting people have to be at the heart of a good story.  In \\"Children of the Shaman\\", it's easy to grow attached to all five of the main characters, because they all have believable strengths and flaws.<br />The story is set in a remote frozen North.  The level of technology seems to be about mid nineteenth century, as we see trains and other glimpses of industrial technology.  Unlike many fantasy authors, Rydill actually has researched  and understood the societies on which her world is modeled.  Thus, we get solid world-building, with lots of attention to the details of daily life, such as medical practice.  Indeed, after the first hundred pages or so, this was looking like a five-star book.<br />Things change a bit once when one character is abducted and taken to a strange alternate universe and the others follow in an attempt to save him.  To be sure, Rydill offers some inventive and intriguing possibilities for this new world.  Bands of visitiors who have made a deal with evil forces, and mysterious group of people who walk on stilts, and so forth.  The problem is that much of the behavior we see during these encounters just doesn't ring true the way that earlier scenes did.  For instance, in one situation the heroes encounter a band of natives who mistakes them for a Goddess and her followers.  However, the entire scenario, and most particularly the dialogue, feels somewhat forced and unrealistic.<br />So in summary, \\"Children of the Shaman\\" is a good book that could have been even better.  Since the ending seems to point towards a possible sequel, we can only hope that Rydill will return to this world, and possibly pay more attention towards capturing realistic behavior in odd situations.  Also, the editor needs to be more careful, since this book has a number of errors in spelling and word choice.  Finally, I should note that although there are only a few violent scenes here, Rydill does not flinch from intense descriptions, and she has graphic portraits of fight scenes and injuries.	2004-01-11

The idea is still the same: a wild adventure story with lots of diversions.  The difference is that Pratchett's writing is more consistently funny this time around.  The jokes are sharper are more witty, and there are more of them.  Pratchett serves up some well deserved swipes at fantasy conventions, and accomplishes more memorable wordplay.

He was, in fact, a rebel.  He attacked.  He provoked.  He openly asked questions and challenged assumptions that few in his time would have dared to consider.  And he did it all while running in circles around censors and moralists who had vowed to shut down any speech that they found unsatisfactory.  He was, in fact, a man who would have been very much sympathetic to some of the counter-culture artists of modern times.<br />That is the critical observation that Peter Hyland makes in his book &quot;An Introduction to Shakespeare&quot;.  He says at the start something that I have always felt.  If we are to keep the memory of the world's greatest author alive, we need to teach students to understand the background that Shakespeare was working in.  Thus, Hyland devotes the first of three major sections to explaining the context.  He gives brief summaries of the religious, political, and economic situations that Shakespeare lived with, and explains what challenges the establishment was facing.  Especially considering how many American students get woefully inadequate exposure to European history, this information is vital.<br />In his second section, Hyland covers Shakespeare's life.  He gives an adequate short biography and walks the reader through the major controversies that have arisen surrounding the evidence that we have.  In particular, he carefully shoots down the argument that the plays written by somebody other than the person born in Stratford under the name William Shakespeare.<br />The final third of the book covers the plays, of course, starting with a brief explanation of Shakespeare's literary technique.  Each play gets about a page of attention, usually focused on thematic content, along with some attempt to track the playwright's development as his career progressed.  This is the section of the book that could have most used a little expansion.  Unfortunately, somebody must have been determined to make sure that it stayed under two hundred pages.	2004-01-02

Let's put aside for the moment the paper-thin, stereotypical characters, the silly digressions, the pointless fight scenes, the predictable plotting, the lengthy history lectures, the logical inconsistencies, and all those inexplicable similarities to Tolkien's work, and focus for a minute on Mr. Brooks' writing.  Lazy and sloppy doesn't begin to describe it.  There is simply no understanding here of how to craft good sentences and good paragraphs, how to chose the right word, or how to integrate it into coherent passages.  There's a severe case of overwriting:<br />&quot;In that secure, drifting dimension of fantasy, their weary minds could relax, releasing the hidden fears of tomorrow to emerge in whatever form they wished, and there, in that most distant sanctuary for the human soul, be faced privately and overcome.  But even with the reassuring sounds of life all about them and the peaceful rushing of the gleaming silver river to soothe their cares, an inescapable gnawing specter of apprehension wormed its stealthy way into their dream world and there, in full view of the mind's eye, it perched and waited, smiling dully, hatefully - knowing well the limits of their endurance.&quot;<br />There's some howlers:<br />&quot;The strangeness of the situation increased almost immediately as he glanced up to see the strange root-limbed tree, previously immobile, approaching in a slow, stretching motion, its limbs extended towards him, their tips containing small but deadly-looking needles.  Thoroughly aroused now, Menion dropped his pack and bow in one motion and unsheathed the great sword.&quot;<br />But the crux of the issue is that it's just plain bad writing, lazy and without good editing.  Brooks doesn't capture the flow of normal conversation.  When he tries to write about some characters chatting with each other in a relaxed setting, the result doesn't sound like a real conversation.  People spitting out descriptors of their emotional state and reciting mechanical details just doesn't make the cut.<br />And what about that plot anyway.  Look, folks, I know that 'borrowing' from Tolkien is a frequent occurrence in fantasy, and that we all have to learn to live with it.  But here it's just ridiculous.  Not just the events that occur, but the order that they occur in, the spacing, everything comes straight from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.  Do we have no right to expect a little effort, at least a small try at originality?  Could Brooks not come up with just one tactic or scenario of his own?  Just one?<br />Lastly, let me mention that there are illustrations.  Alleged illustrations, anyway.  Maybe it was just a printer's mistake, but in my paperback edition they are far too dark.  In fact, they're almost entirely black, and it's almost impossible to see what the picture is supposed to be.  So the illustrations are a waste of paper.  Then again, so is the whole book.	2003-12-18

Obviously this is not just a fantasy novel, it is the fantasy novel.  It's the one that moved the genre beyond cheesy entertainment and showed us what could an author with real vision, skill, and understanding could do.  Tolkien brought us meaning, depth, and power.  He brought us a story that is truly magnificent.  Small wonder that so many of today's fantasy dwarves have decided to just rip him off rather than coming up with their own story.  Small wonder also that those who are actually forging new frontiers and thinking up new ideas continue to cite Tolkien as their favorite author and leading influence.<br />What exactly is it that Tolkien gets and the dwarves don't?  Everything, really.  But character is at the heart of it.  Tolkien starts out with characters; that's why he wrote an opening chapter designed the show us the world of the Shire before the action actually starts.  We understand Frodo not just as an automaton who experiences fear at point A and hope at point B, but rather as a living, breathing person.  We know where he comes from, how he was raised, what drives him, and so forth, and thus we actually care what happens to him.  And Tolkien does something that Brooks, Jordan, Goodkind, et. al. would never even consider: he works out true, dynamic personalities for his entire cast.  Even minor characters such as Legolas and Gimli are distinct, not just cheesy comic relief sidekicks.<br />But what really builds &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; into the greatest experience in fantasy is the little moments.  Things that don't necessarily have the fate of the entire world hinging on them, but which are still emotionally memorable.  For instance, when Sam first sees an enemy soldier dying near the start of book four, he pauses a moment to reflect on what that man's life might have been like and why he chose to serve the side of darkness.  I also especially commend the scenes in the Houses of Healing in book six, Gimli's reflections after visiting Lothorien, and some of the pleasant banter between the hobbits in the first three chapters.  Robert Jordan and the terrible Terrys, obsessed as they are with lame fight scenes and cheap melodrama, probably wouldn't be capable of such truly moving moments even if they had the desire to be real authors.<br />Some people claim that Tolkien achieved his current vaunted status merely by being the first author to stew together mythology and fairy tales in a novel with such a large vision, and that his actually skill at writing isn't that great.  They're wrong; it is that great.  In the nuts and bolts elements of writing, he is without peer.  Look at the landscapes.  When the Hobbits arrive at the Black Gate and see the barren mountains of Mordor, Tolkien actually makes you feel the desolation of the landscape and the brooding presence of evil, rather than just telling you that they exist.  I personally have always been delighted by authors who throw in some descriptions of nature just for the sake of describing nature.  It not only helps you visualize the scene, but also lets you enjoy the beauty of it.e scenes in the Houses of Healing in book six, Gimli's reflections after visiting Lothorien, and some of the pleasant banter between the hobbits in the first three chapters.

The last two volumes, however, are an unnecessary add-on.  The pacing lags, the characters don't develop any more, and the conclusion is far too predictable.  &quot;Summerblood&quot; and &quot;Warautumn&quot; should have been merged together into one more succinct book, or better yet, never written at all.<br />Avall, Rann, and five others have been magically transported to an island in the middle of nowhere.  Merryn and Krynneth have been captured and imprisoned by rogue Ixtian warriors.  Strynn and Div are trying to track them down.  The army of Eron continues to lay siege to the Ninth Face at Gem Hold.  Tyrill conducts covert operations against the priests in Tir-Eron.  We rotate among these five different groups of characters for quite a while, because it takes quite a while for anything to happen.  There are a lot of details that we could have done without.  For instance, Avall and his followers plan to build a raft in order to escape the island:<br />&quot;In any case&quot;, he continued, &quot;it's time we talked about getting off this island.  It's a fine place as far as it goes, but we obviously can't stay here indefinitely.  We'd already ruled out swimming to the mainland because that wasn't viable with you unconscious, Kylin, and because it would take forever to get any of our gear across.  And that was before we saw what lives in the water.  That leaves building a raft or boat.&quot;<br />&quot;A raft would be easier,&quot; Rann observed.  &quot;If for no other reason than because we could build one large enough to accommodate all of us and the supplies we have here a lot faster than we could build a boat that would accomplish the same things.&quot;<br />Lykkon nodded.  &quot;And while there are plenty of trees on this island, they're either way too big to be workable, or too small.  Whereas a raft-&quot;<br />&quot;There's thick-cane down by the shore on the south side,&quot; Bingg supplied.  &quot;I saw it from up top.  There's more up there, for that matter, but the growth onshore is larger, plus we wouldn't have to carry anything we made so far to set it afloat.&quot;<br />As you can hopefully tell, this isn't exactly nail-biting, pulse-pounding drama.  Does it get better in the second half of the book?  A little, but not enough to justify such a big chunk of paper.  I officially recommend that you read only the first two volumes and skip the final two.  You'll have a much more enjoyable read while committing less money and less time that way.	2003-11-27

Astonishing.  Breathtaking.  The sort of fantasy novel that you expect to find once a decade, if it's a particularly good decade.  This is the culmination of a story that so big you can barely believe it fits in three books, so intense that it seems amazing that any person could actually have written it.  It is a story you will never forget.<br />One portion of the novels follows Lord Morham as he attempts to save the Land from total destruction in a final battle against Lord Foul's forces.  The giant reaver Satansfist has Morham and the other wizards and defenders of the Land under siege at the castle of Revelstone.  This contest is in amazing piece of virtuoso writing, perfectly melding several great action sequences with intense psychological passages to create something dazzling.  I feel perfectly comfortable saying the Donaldson is the only fantasy author who has ever equaled Tolkien in writing battle scenes.  The emotional triumph at the conclusion of this one is, well, words just can't describe it.<br />Any lesser author would have devoted an entire book just to that.  For Donaldson, however, it's just the prelude to the main event.  The main event, it's no spoiler to say, is the final showdown between Thomas Covenant and Lord Foul.  And what a showdown it is.  When Donaldson started writing this trilogy, the most important decision he made was that his main character would not be a standard fantasy hero.  Thomas Covenant, of course, is the most deeply sympathetic and real character ever to appear in any fantasy novel.  Having created a person as amazing as this one, of course, poses the problem of how to provide a satisfying conclusion while still remaining true to the character.  Probably nobody alive could have pulled it off as well as Donaldson, but then again no one other than Donaldson would ever have attempted a fantasy series this ambitious anyway.<br />So in conclusion, read it, love it, be amazed by it.	2003-11-20

Now those favorites from my younger days are curious things.  As a child, they never seemed to grow old or stale.  I read this book and several others until my copies were ready to fall apart.  But upon rereading them as an adult, some of them have proven to be disappointing.  Which isn't to say that books like The Chronicles of Narnia or \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" are bad, but they don't carry as much emotional punch as they could and seem a little tedious in retrospect.<br />Not so with \\"The Hobbit\\".  Having recently read it for the first time in more than ten years, I can say that this book is every bit as exciting and imaginative from an adult perspective as from a child's.  It is amazing.  It approaches perfection in so many areas that it daunts the imagination.  For instance, consider how much Tolkien is able to accomplish in just the first chapters.  He introduces all the important characters and gives them distinctive personalities, builds sympathy for the hero, provides all the necessary backstory, injects a little humor, and prepares you for the epic adventure ahead.<br />And what an adventure it is!  I marveled at Tolkien's amazing skill in so many areas.  His action sequences are fast, short, and easy to visualize.  His songs and poetry add a wonderfully quaint touch to the story.  His simple descriptive writing paints perfect portraits of landscapes in just a few sentences.  There is literally nothing done wrong in this story.  The current crop of fantasy authors would do well to pause from their latest eight-hundred page extravaganza and remind themselves that Tolkien never repeated himself or included anything unnecessary.  His goal was to write small and speedy, to always be providing something new for the reader.<br />A note about the illustrations: some of the editions that they're hawking now include copies of the pen and ink drawings that Tolkien did for the first edition.  Like many people, I was raised with the 1966 paperback that didn't include the illustrations.  It's an unfortunate fact that Tolkien's skill as an artist didn't come close to matching his skill as a writer.  Some of the drawings are decent, but others are almost laughably bad.  I would recommend trying to find a copy without the illustrations.many people, I was raised with the 1966 paperback that didn't include the illustrations.

The Faded Sun Trilogy will never be listed among the absolute greats of the science fiction genre, but it does bring a touch of originality and intelligence, enough to be well worth reading.  The story, as you can read on the back cover, follows a race of alien warriors known as the Kel, who hire out as mercenaries on spacegoing missions for other species.  While they have long been viewed as the greatest soldiers in the galaxy, they are losing a war against humanity, who they view as fighting without honor.<br />However, the war between humans and the Kel is not the main focus of this book.  The majority of the story focuses on the journey undertaken by surviving Kel to find their forgotten homeworld, and in a larger sense on their species' struggle to find purpose and meaning in a world that no longer seems to value them.  The portions of the trilogy that are written from an alien perspective are the best parts, a fascinating exploration of a society built on completely different assumptions than our own.  Unfortunately, Cherryh decided to add on a large number of human characters in the second and third novels, and much of the material dedicated to them is frequently a bit boring.<br />Writing throughout the trilogy is first-rate.  Cherryh provides good, spare, efficient descriptions of landscapes and scenery, and she makes good use of dialogue in a huge variety of situations.  The total amount of storytelling that's covered in just three short books is rather remarkable.  Also, the thought-provoking, philosophical portions of the books are worked well into a story that also has plenty of entertainment value.  While it's true that there isn't non-stop action, each novel does have a stirring conclusion, and there are some surprising twists and turns that will keep you reading.	2003-10-15

There are, of course, countless projects that tried to tell the entire story of human history and feature huge plot events where the fate of entire planets hangs in the balance.  But nobody, to my knowledge, has ever done so with the same incredible level of detail that Robinson gives us.<br />&quot;Blue Mars&quot; begins just minutes after where &quot;Green Mars&quot; ended, as various factions fight against UNTA and each other in the ongoing outburst of violence.  The battles only take up about fifty pages at the start of the book, and that's followed by a segment devoted to the survivors attempting to establish a system of government on Mars.  But while &quot;Green Mars&quot; focused almost entirely on the underground movements and the preparations for the climactic revolt, &quot;Blue Mars&quot; tells a more freewheeling story.  As the author frequently reminds us, Mars is a big place, with space for a huge number of communities and individuals to explore and develop.<br />The story told in this book, simply put, is huge.  It goes all over the solar system and beyond, looking at how life changes in the future for a gigantic cast of characters.  Some of it may seem far-fetched, but all of it is well-written and exciting.  There are, as in the previous two books, a lot of passages of descriptive writing, as Robinson tries to help you visualize what he has in mind in terms of setting.  In my humble opinion, these passages are the master stroke.  They draw the reader into the world that the author creates, making it more real than any other science fiction novel that I can think of.  &quot;Blue Mars&quot; is a masterpiece, and a vast improvement over the slower-paced &quot;Green Mars&quot;.	2003-10-04

Queen Idrilain decides that her country's only hope is to get aid from the Aurenfaie, so she sends her daughter on a diplomatic mission.  She is accompanied by our heroes, Seregil and Alec, as well as Beka and her soldiers.<br />The biggest problem with this book is the first two hundred pages.  After a single big action sequence, things slow down quite a bit.  After the band of characters enters Aurenen, a lot of time is spent on infodumps about the society there.  I found this disappointing since Flewelling had managed to keep the plot moving at a good pace throughout the first two books of the series.  Fortunately, things kick back into gear after they reach the city of Sarikali, and we get intrigues, a new archvillain, a murder mystery, and more.  Overall, &quot;Traitor's Moon&quot; should be satisfactory to anyone who's enjoyed this author's other works.	2003-09-22

He stays at an inn.  Then he buys a horse.  Then he rides to another inn.  Then he runs away from the inn.  Then he stays at another inn.  Then he meets another wizard who agrees to be his mentor.  Then he stays at another inn.  Then he uses his magic power on some sheep.  Then he stays at another inn.  Then he stays at another inn.  It was around this point that I quit reading, for the obvious reason that nothing was happening.<br />L. E. Modesitt apparently feels that he holds an amazing gift for onomatopoeia.  He frequently provides long streams of letters that are apparently supposed to communicate sounds such as doors creaking and leaves rustling.  The coup de grace is Lerris' horse, which makes a wider variety of sounds than a full chamber orchestra and unfortunately makes them very often.  We also get to spend a huge amount of time reading about what Lerris has for breakfast, what he's wearing today, what weapons he's carrying, and lots of other insignificant details.  Other details are left out, for instance characterization.  Despite the fact that he's wandering through a land he's never seen before and supposedly learning about his surging magical powers, Lerris' only reaction is to repeatedly state his boredom with everything so frequently that it becomes like a mantra.  Minor characters fair even worse, and invariably seem to disappear after only a few chapters on screen.<br />There is also a bad guy drifting around somewhere, though we never really see him doing anything bad, so it's tough to tell why we're supposed to be frightened of him.  Also, what's the big deal with the conflict between &quot;chaos magic&quot; and &quot;order magic&quot;?  Order magic is supposed to be good and chaos magic is supposed to be evil, but we're never shown any actual justification for any of it.  I got the feeling that this was just a silly gimmick inserted by the author in a desperate attempt to generate interest.  For a much better analysis of the topic in a fantasy novel, I recommend &quot;The High House&quot; by James Stoddard.	2003-09-20

While the fantasy genre overflows with cliches and trite, formulaic writing, an effective satire of it needs to do more than just point out those overused ideas.  Such a novel would soon grow boring.  And that's the good thing about &quot;The Color of Magic&quot;: it isn't satisfied with just making a few lame jokes over and over again.  There's at least one new punchline on almost every page.  Is it a good punchline?  Usually.  Many people have compared Pratchett to Douglas Adams.  I don't think that he's quite that good in this book, but he comes close.  As with Adams, some of the best jokes come during brief diversions that pop up to explore some background point, without any real relevance to the story.  And yes, there are a few instances where the joke isn't quite as funny as the author seems to think, but overall the book is well worth reading.	2003-09-11

You've got your good guys.  You've got your arch bad guy who's trying to get the magic doohickey so that he can perform the ritual that will give him tremendous powers.  You've got your escalating series of conflicts, your mysterious characters whose true loyalties are unknown, your intriguing subplots, and so forth.  Some people may object that the book is too formulaic, but I don't view it that way.  Although the elements may be stereotypical, Lynn Flewelling breathes life into them by paying attention to detail and adding new twists that you don't expect.  For example, consider Nysander.  In the first book, \\"Luck in the Shadows\\", he appeared to be a very typical 'wise old bearded wizard mentor' figure.  In this volume, however, he is revealed to be a much more complex character.  He is neither all-knowing nor supremely confident.  Instead, he struggles with his tasks and has doubts about himself.<br />Another facet of Flewelling's plot that deserves credit is that it never slows down.  She never needs to pause and spend fifty pages having characters chat with each other, or waste time on anything that's not relevant to the plot.  In fact, almost every chapter in the book contains some new surprise or development.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that she doesn't always take the most obvious approach to writing a particular scene, but instead uses betrayals and other plot intrigues to keep the reader on their toes.<br />Lastly, I'll agree with other reviewers who applauded the author's handling of the relationship between Seregil and Alec in \\"Stalking Darkness\\".  I'm willing to read about any couple in a fantasy novel; to me, it doesn't matter whether the characters involved are gay or straight.  What does matter is that the relationship is well-written and interesting.  In \\"Stalking Darkness\\", the interaction between Seregil and Alec feels real, and the characters' reaction to it are remarkably human.	2003-09-10

It picks up shortly after where \\"Springwar\\" left off.  The good guys in Eron have driven off the bad guys from Ixti, and now they're settling down to the business of running a kingdom.  Their first order of business is to have the magic regalia taken away from the capitol and hidden somewhere in the mountains.  Why?  The explanation provided doesn't really make any sense, and I was left with the impression that Deitz threw that twist into the book solely because he couldn't come up with any other way to create an interesting plot for the last two volumes of the series.<br />I'm torn about how to respond to \\"Summerblood\\", because other than that distraction, Deitz maintains the generally high quality level from \\"Bloodwinter\\" and \\"Springwar\\".  Characters remain realistic, pacing remains fast, writing remains solid.  There is one scene close to the middle of the book that is particularly noteworthy for its effectiveness.  However, there's no getting away from the fact that the characters here sometimes act like idiots just because the plot requires them to, a tactic usually associated with the weakest authors.  So I have to agree with the other reviewer who described this as the poorest book in the series.	2003-09-05

This book barely contains any magic prior to the very end, and instead focuses on the travails of a large cast of major characters.  The story takes place in two rival countries, Eron and Ixti, both of which have recently been devastated by plague.  We follow sets of characters in both countries as their lives are slowly drawn into the conflict.  Deitz's worldbuilding is outstanding, and we get very detailed pictures of what life is like for people who live in these places.<br />Deitz also avoids a lot of fantasy tropes, such as wise old wizards or armies of orcs.  Instead, he gives us a big slate of human characters, and what human characters they are!  As with almost all good modern fantasy, Deitz has eschewed the standard 'evil overlord vs. reluctant hero' storyline and instead devised a complex and realistic political situation.  In Eron, there is no inherited monarchy.  Instead, the King is elected, and members of twenty-four different clans vie for control during the process.  Deitz takes a sophisticated approach to characterization.  The heroes all have their flaws and struggle with conflicting loyalties, while the villains are treated with a degree of sympathy.	2003-08-24

The good thing about &quot;Springwar&quot; is that it doesn't feel like that.  Tom Deitz clearly planned this entire series of books from the beginning, and they all fit together as a coherent story, rather than an episodic group of events where new people and concepts just spring up out of the ground.  In this book, Barrax begins his invasion of Eron from the south, while Avall rushes to bring King Gynn the news about the gem.  We also see more of Strynn, Rann, Rrath, Eddyn and all the other characters from &quot;Bloodwinter&quot; as they get drawn into the growing battle between the two nations.<br />All of Deitz's strengths that were present in the first book appear here again.  He has some very nice character arcs in place here, and it's good to see a fantasy author who actually thinks about how his heroes and villains would be affected by the events that they take part in.  The dialogue is generally well-written, although occasionally a little bit soap operaish.  I also can't fault this author's pacing.  Unlike certain other fantasy authors (*cough cough Robert Jordan*), all of the books in Deitz's series contain a great deal of action and plot advancement.  The central conflict does actually get resolved by the end of the book, and several important things do actually happen to all of the main characters.<br />A final note about magic in &quot;Springwar&quot;.  One of the things that I liked about the first book was that only very minor supernatural elements were present; I think that many of the best modern fantasy authors are realizing that my including fewer mythical elements, they can focus more on the human beings at the heart of the story.  In this volume, however, the presence of magical power increases quite a bit.  I have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, I think that the way the character respond to the discovery of their magical abilities is very realistic.  On the other hand, the one might view the power of the gems as a contrived plot device that allows them to solve all their problems without real effort, thus rendering the series less realistic than authors such as George R. R. Martin or Robin Hobb.  But despite that fact, I still highly recommend these books as one of the few intelligent and mature series in the genre.	2003-08-24

Although this was her first novel, it was the third one of her books that I've read.  All of them have been well-written with excellent imagination.  So why are her books so much fun to read?<br />Lots of action.  Even though her novels are relatively short, they each contain several large-scale action scenes and plenty of individual sword fights.  Wells has clearly studied medieval weaponry and warfare closely enough to know what she's talking about.  Her fight scenes are very realistic and easy to visualize.<br />Surprises.  \\"The Element of Fire\\" has lots of courtly intrigue and unpredictable plot developments.  There's back stabbing, double agents, triple agents, plots, counterplots, and mysterious deaths of major characters right when you least expect it.<br />Tough characters.  Looking for pathetic little reluctant heroes who have to whine for hundreds of pages before they can do anything?  Look elsewhere.  Wells provides truly hardcore, brave, and loyal characters who aren't afraid to fight and die for what they believe in.  I particularly enjoy how Wells gives them humorous dialogue, such as when characters taunt each other before a fight.	2003-08-08

The United States sends teams of scientists to explore it, and they soon find that the asteroid was a gigantic spaceship of sorts that appears to have come from our own future.  Investigations into a library found on board soon reveal that the world is moving towards a massive nuclear showdown.  This is the good portion of the book.  It is written with intelligence, clarity, and an almost nostalgia-inducing dose of Cold War paranoia.  The cast of characters is what most people have come to expect from hard science fiction: not extremely deep or dynamic, but believable nonetheless.<br />However, it all breaks down about halfway through the book.  The story makes a wide turn involving alien invasion, parallel universes, alternate geometries, and some other stuff.  The problem, simply put, is that this part of the book is too confusing.  The explanations are cryptic and difficult to follow, and keeping track of all the new concepts that get introduced becomes quite a chore.  Also, the characterizations collapse during the second half of the book.  All of the major characters seem too ready to forget and ignore their previous lives and to accept all of the weird stuff that happens to them.  One might, of course, make the argument that some enigmatic writing is acceptable and that &quot;Eon&quot; is a novel one that requires multiple readings, somewhat like William Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.  The problem is that Bear doesn't have the literary style to pull such a stunt off, and I really have no desire to pour through this book time after time trying to fit the puzzle together.  While I have great respect for some ofBear's other works, this one could have used some more planning and rewriting.	2003-08-03

The high point of this book comes when a gnome named \\"Shannon the Small\\" bites the hero on the crotch, and yet Del Rey is calling this \\"The epic fantasy of the year\\"?  Tolkien must be spinning in his grave.  In all honesty, the awfulness of \\"The Fifth Sorceress\\" and the pathetic tactics that Del Rey used to market it have both become the subject of internet legend, so posting yet another scathing review here would almost be redundant.  But my rage at having my time wasted by such lazy and lousy rubbish has yet to die down, so I'm going to do it anyway.<br />To say that \\"The Fifth Sorceress\\" is the most pathetic, incoherent, solipsistic, tedious, and idiotic fantasy novel ever written would be to give this turkey far more respect than it deserves.  A fantasy novel by definition is supposed to have a storyline, characters, and some sort of plot progression.  The Fifth sorceress, by contrast, is nothing more than a collection of disgusting NC-17 sex scenes pitched together in a heap of rubble, bearing no relationship to the book's alleged plot and no obvious justification for their existence other than that the author apparently feels that his horny teenage audience wishes to ogle at such material.  I'd like to point out that when I say this, I'm not referring merely to the sorts of BDSM filth that's been proliferating among talentless hacks of the fantasy genre during recent years, though Newcomb does gratuitously douse his readers with several hundred pages of such material.  This book also includes extremely lengthy and very graphic depictions of women being dunked in piles of feces and vomit, getting eaten alive by rats, and being raped by monsters, and it's all presented in such an exploitative  manner that it's clear the author enjoys these scenes and expects his readers to as well.  Needless to say, the publisher does not admit that this book is pornography, but instead dredges up the ludicrous claim that stuffing chapter after chapter with such filth makes \\"The Fifth Sorceress\\" adult fantasy.  Exactly how dumb do they think we are?  Adult fantasy is achieved through high quality writing and thorough character development; authors who devote half their book to juvenile masturbation fantasy do so with the sole intention of roping in a teenage audience that has not yet developed good taste.  And the fact that Mr. Newcomb has yet to advance beyond the \\"girls are icky, they've got cooties\\" stage is really just adding insult to injury.  I could delve into that topic further, but other reviewers seemed to have covered it adequately.<br />So if we look past the masochistic porn, what do we get?  Not much.  Some fantasy authors such as Robert Jordan have stumbled upon the problem that later volumes of their series' grow slow and repetitious.  Newcomb neatly circumvents this obstacle by making his opus labored and tedious right from the start.  As a matter of fact, there is only one real action scene in the entire work, and the plot is not even set into motion until two hundred pages have gone by.  Most of that opening section is consumed by pointless descriptions of dresses and furniture and equally trivial interior monologues by which the main characters state their personalities or lack thereof.  Newcomb also packs an fixation with annoying mannerisms (if you think that Jordan is obsessed with women's braids, you ain't seen nothing yet) and is so in love with the sound of his own writing that he makes his characters repeat oaths of loyalty and other patches of uninspired dialogue over and over again.  His total inability to edit down his bulky blocks of text eventually leads him to stretch a trite and formulaic fantasy plot over seven hundred pages, not one of which contains the slightest hint of excitement.<br />Fantasy is not a genre known for great psychological depth or outstanding logic, but there are times where Newcomb's stupidity is so aggressive that he seems to be rubbing it in the reader's face.  For instance, when main hero Tristan sees most of his family and friends get butchered off in a surprise attack, it seems intuitively obvious that this would be a rather traumatizing experience.  Tristan, however, displays no emotional reaction to it at all, and instead just sits patiently while his wise old bearded wizard mentor regales him with a fifty-page lecture of how Newcomb's magic system works.  (What's particularly embarrassing is that it's just a standard light magic vs. dark magic system.)  For that matter, the wise mentor also says that he knew the attack was coming, but doesn't provide any explanation as to why he didn't move to prevent it.  If Newcomb ever does bother to take up classes in psychology or logic, he might want to consider sitting in on an English class as well.  He overuses cliches and his descriptions are so poorly written that they frequently become entirely meaningless.<br />It might appear to some that I've been overly nasty in my review.  But the fact is that Del Rey is being nasty to us, the fans of the fantasy genre, by printing such filth and asking us to spend money on it.  By publishing \\"The Fifth Sorceress\\", they're basically saying that they treat the whole genre as a joke and its fans as idiots.  While I feel contempt for the editors and publishers who approved this rubbish heap, I can't summon up anything other than pity for Robert Newcomb, an author who has obvious been pampered and sheltered from reality for so long that he is not even capable of considering the possibility that anything he writes could be less than literary gold.  This unfortunate miscalculation will only earn him notoriety in the minds of generations of fans as an author whose incompetence in storytelling was matched only by his hubristic opinions of his own work.  It's sad, but nothing can be done about it now.	2003-07-29

In fact, the trio of protagonists in this book are quite engaging, and their dialogue is sharp and witty, at least at the start.  We have Rhapsody, a former prostitute who's on the run from an overly enthusiastic client.  She meets up with Achmed and Gunther, two mysterious outlaws who have something to do with a shadowy archvillain bent on destroying the world.  (I've never understood why these archvillains can't be satisfied with less grandiose evil plans such as robbing from their employees' 401K plans.)  The principle joy of the book comes from watching the personalities of these three characters bounce off each other.  I readily admit that I did laugh out loud at some of their exchanges, and admire the subtle and persuasive way that the author handled the development of their characters during the opening section.<br />The problem is more or less everything else.  Plotting, pacing, and worldbuilding don't just suffer, they get flogged within an inch of their life.  First of all, the quest that the three characters go on kicks off with a huge section of wandering underground.  This set of chapters ought to have been shortened to a fraction of its current length.  Upon emerging, they find themselves in a land that's at war, though inexplicably nobody seems to know who is doing the fighting or why.  Other than establishing a vaguely hippie-ish religious system, Haydon makes virtually no attempt to explain what this culture is like.  Despite the war, everybody that they meet appears to have nothing better to do with their time than provide lengthy lectures on topics ranging from herbology to history, and these sermons serve no visible purpose other than to fill space.  There's also some swordfighting, quite tedious since the three good guys can easily paste any number of villains.  I can't honestly claim that I reached the ending of &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, my usual determination to finish whatever I start having flagged after three hundred pages of such emptiness, but at least I'll know better than to buy the sequels.	2003-07-25

I think that Eddings gives each of the five books in the series it's own distinct flavor and character, and that makes the entire series sufficiently entertaining to be worth reading.  &quot;Castle of Wizardry&quot;, the fourth book in the Belgariad, has less action than the rest of the series, but it makes up for that by having more humor.  There's lots of hilarious conversations and clever descriptions that poke fun at characters.  It's the comic high point of a series that already very much tongue-in-cheek, and a delightful way to burn through a few hours of your spare time.	2003-07-22
US	41549714	RMC8IUOQ9BSNT	0345348656	150650131	Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, Book 1)	Books	5	3	9	N	N	Astonishing	Reading &quot;Lord Foul's Bane&quot; is the literary equivalent of ordering a cheeseburger and getting a five-star meal.  While having all the appearance of a standard, formulaic entry in the fantasy genre, the book actually is a literary masterpiece.  It explores the big questions about the nature of reality, ethics, and the meaning of human life, but at the same time tells a gripping story with one of the most exciting endings I've ever read.<br />The story, as you probably already know, goes like this: Thomas Covenant lives as a leper in our 'real' world.  His community shuns him and his family has abandoned him.  After being knocked unconscious in an accident, he awakes to find himself in &quot;The Land&quot;, a fantasy universe where he appears to be the reincarnation of an ancient hero and the only person who can save the world from evil.  What makes this book so different is that Donaldson dedicated great effort to making Covenant's reaction to the situation intensely believable.  In fact, I would feel confident in saying that Thomas Covenant is the most thoroughly developed and convincing character that the fantasy genre has ever produced.  Since &quot;Lord Foul's Bane&quot; is told entirely from the perspective of the protagonist, the reader gets to know all of his thought processes and view all of his struggles to reconcile his need for reality with the fantasy world that he sees around him.<br />The other aspect where Donaldson surpasses almost all fantasy authors is descriptive writing.  As part of his story, he makes it clear that &quot;The Land&quot; appears to Covenant as a much more pristine and beautiful environment than the real world.  To back up this presentation, he provides some of the most wonderful word pictures of the landscape that I've ever read.  Because of this, you can actually picture what the world looks like and comprehend why it has such a profound effect on the main character.  Overall, I rank this series as being one of the greatachievements in the fantasy genre, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anybody.	2003-07-16
US	41549714	R2TRPCBDFNXJWO	0312863551	562507215	The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Heinlein's Best	A recent and much-publicized poll by the Science Fiction Fan Club attempted to list the fifty greatest science fiction and fantasy works of the last fifty years, and &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; failed to make the cut.  This just goes to show, I suppose, that some people still don't get it.  This is a brilliant book, insightful, clever, thought-provoking, and one of only a few science fiction classics from the sixties that has aged well over the past four decades.<br />The story, of course, is set late in the twenty-first century, when the Moon is being used as a penal colony.  A group of insurgents is working to overthrow the Authority, but progress is slow until the computer responsible for running communication and almost everything else becomes sentient and is talked into fighting on the side of the rebels.  While the novel does contain a complete and coherent story arc, it essentially exists as a fairly episodic sequence of events, each one exploring specific topics.  There are discussions ranging everywhere how to deal with a computer that develops a sense of humor to whether alternate family arrangements would be superior to our society's current norms.  I may be deterring some potential readers with this description, so let me make two things clear.  First of all, &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is peopled with a cast of distinctive and engaging characters, and they keep their personalities at all times even when they're planning or debating.  Secondly, the writing in this book is outstanding.  The most distinctive feature is the dialogue.  Heinlein tried to predict what future English dialects might sound like based on trends that he saw in speech.  The result is word choice and vocabulary that in some ways was a quite accurate prediction of how spoken language has changed in the last two generations.  It should also be mentioned that Heinlein makes very efficient use of his sentences and paragraphs, leading to a book that covers a tremendous amount of ground in less than four-hundred pages.<br />Of course, the political and social aspects of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; will probably always remain its most controversial feature.  Heinlein has quite a bit to say about any number of topics; I won't attempt to summarize it all here.  Some of it I agree with while other parts I'm strongly opposed to, but I don't judge novels by the stances of their writers.  The important thing is he integrates his ideas into the story and presents them in a convincing manner.  There are a few subtle hints which suggest that Heinlein didn't intend for his message to be taken entirely at face value (a fact which seems to have passed over the heads of a few readers), but in my mind any book that challenges the reader to think from new perspectives rather than just trying to buttress old ones qualifies as a success.  Many political novels go to extremes of dichotomy, making one side universally noble and honest while the other team gets depicted as completely vile.  One thing that I found refreshing about &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is that it readily admitted that even the good guys had to be duplicitous and occasionally criminal in order to win the day.  Such honesty about politics is refreshing indeed.	2003-07-06
US	41549714	RX8G381AK8SX8	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Outstanding	When you pick up a truly great novel for the first time, you can usually tell that you're encountering a masterpiece by the end of the opening chapter.  So it is with \\"The Curse of Chalion\\".  The story opens simply, with a man wandering on a road towards a distant castle.  He talks briefly with a group a soldiers and investigates a site where an extremely deadly and secretive form of magic was recently employed, while a few tantalizing hints about his horrifying past are revealed.  Best of all, though, is the language.  Like all good authors, Lois McMaster Bujold is capable of employing her words, sentences, and paragraphs to maximum effect.  Although only a few lines are devoted to describing the landscape, the word choice is so vivid that readers won't have any trouble visuzlizing what she is describing.<br />Equally important, though, is the fact that Bujold handles her main character, the centerpiece of the story, extrordinarily well.  All things considered, this is a character-driven novel, and it stands as one of the few fantasy novels that has triumphed in that manner.  As we see the main character recovering from the years that he spent at war and as a captive of the enemy, the process of his mental and physical recovery remains realistic throughout, sometimes brutally so.  Likewise, his reaction to the events around him and his relationships with other characters are always plausible.  Bujold's dedication to realism extends to the minor characters as well, although some of them are a bit simplistic.<br />The final major advantage of \\"The Curse of Chalion\\" is the plot.  This book eschews the stereotypical 'good guys vs. bad guys' storyline in favor of a situation where an entire royal family, and almost the entire cast of characters is struggling against a curse that has been brought on by the actions of an earlier King.  It's fast-moving and contains some real surprising twists and turns right when you least expect them.  I close by adding that the treatment of religion in this book is unique and refreshing.  There's a fascinating polytheistic religious system which the action of Gods and various supernatural creatures affects people's lives in some rather surprising ways.	2003-07-02

Every fantasy fan either loves him or hates him.  If you're in the first category, then you should have no qualms about picking up &quot;Magician's Gambit&quot;.  This volume, in my opinion, is the high point of the series.  It's fast-moving, witty, and well organized, with lots of sword fights and the beginnings of some romance.  The plot follows the same pattern as &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot; and &quot;Queen of Sorcery&quot;, with the group of heroes moving through various countries and occasionally picking up new travellers to help them in their quest to recover the orb.  No further explanation is really necessary.  Just know that Eddings is the fantasy equivalent of comfort food; you've got to indulge in his books once in a while or else you?ll just forget how to have fun.	2003-06-20
US	41549714	RIWBT0FRKOBJ4	0886778581	174499108	Green Rider	Books	2	20	34	N	N	Sort of bad	\\"Green Rider\\" has some decent fight sequences and an occasional moment of cleverness, but honestly, if you're an adult looking for the next big thing in high fantasy, this isn't it.  Kristen Britain's characters are lousy, her plotting is hodgepodge, and her writing is never better than Mercedes Lackey's worst books.  Overall, this comes across as overhyped, underwritten junk for teenagers, a waste of time for any reader who's made it past the \\"Sweet Valley High\\" stage.<br />The main character is Karigan, a young girl who encounters a dying messenger from a guild called \\"The Green Riders\\".  Forced to take over the man's mission, she soon gets caught up in a series of wild adventures and chased by eight-legged beasties and an assortment of not very frightening villains such as \\"The Grey One\\". (I think that name was only chosen because \\"The Dark One\\" was already taken.) Characterization is appallingly thin, with no attempt to move the central character beyond the stereotypical 'spoiled girl encountering the real world for the first time'.  The author doesn't seem to understand that a story like this won't succeed unless the main character is likeable and sympathetic; her protagonist comes across more as irritating.  Minor characters suffer even worse development, and they tend to blend together since they don't serve any purpose other than to gives Karigan advice or assistance for a few pages and then disappear.<br />Of course, a simple quest or adventure story can be enjoyable even if it doesn't aspire to be great literature.  But for this to happen, something must occur to build up tension and suspense, or else the story just flatlines.  You can never really feel that Karigan is in any danger in \\"Green Rider\\" because some new character or concept always get introduced to the story just in time to save her.  And there's one scene where she manages to escape from two bad guys just because they start fighting with each other.  But wait, why did they start fighting witheach other?  It's never explained.<br />One of the first things your high school English teacher probably taught you is the 'show, don't tell' rule.  Kristen Britain must have been absent that day.  When she wants to say that Karigan is angry, she just writes \\"Karigan felt angry\\", or has her say \\"I am angry\\", but she doesn't make the character's words or actions sound angry.  This is a critical difference, and it is symptomatic of Britain's immature writing style.  Also, she chooses too many of those unpronouncable fantasy names with too many apostrophes.  So in summary, let me just say that I did not like this book.  Will children like it?  I doubt it.	2003-06-20
US	41549714	R24CRSWV35QJQY	0345435249	147883919	Darwin's Radio	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Darwin's Radio	&quot;Darwin's Radio&quot; is one of the best hard science fiction novels of recent years, and I don't say that lightly.  Not only does it clearly and concisely explain a bold scientific conjecture, but it also does so in an unexpectedly timely manner.  The idea at the center of the story is a genetic structure called a retrovirus that was incorporated into mammalian DNA millions of years back.  When examples of retroviruses start appearing and affecting people around the world, causing numerous miscarriages, authorities react by treating it as a disease.  However, a trio of scientists believe that this actually marks the next stage in human evolution, and that similar retroviruses were responsible for evolutionary events in the past.  The books follows these three as they search for proof of their theory and attempt to explain some startling facets of the emerging virus.<br />What I particularly enjoyed about this book was how it incorporated the current public attitude towards genetics and biotechnology.  We live at a time when there's still a lot of public misunderstanding about medicine and genetics, politicians frequently abuse that misunderstanding, and standards for scientific journalism in the mainstream media are shockingly low.  Bear incorporates these facts into his story.  There are brief but effective passages designed to show public reaction to the growing epidemic and the scientific community's initial inability to stop it.  And there is discussion of how ordinary people are affected by the events described.  It is these passages, more than anything else, that make this novel so frighteningly realistic.<br />Some reviewers have complained about the quality of characterization in &quot;Darwin's Radio&quot;.  This, of course, is a dilemma that all authors of hard SF face.  If too much space is devoted to the scientific aspects of the story, then the literary aspects must suffer.  I personally don't think that characterization was a major problem in thisbook.  The major characters all have believable and dynamic personalities.  There are a few inner monologues that sound a bit cliched and sloppy, but in the grand scheme of things that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying the book as a whole.	2003-06-11

The story deals with the planet Urras, a modernist technological society, and the moon Annares, an anarchist Utopia populated by outcasts who fled Urras many generations ago.  The plot in this book is really secondary.  The purpose of \\"The Dispossessed\\" is to analyze both of these societies and to point out their strengths and their flaws.  While I don't agree with everything that LeGuin says about community life on Annares, I do believe that she does a good job of displaying what life under such a system would be like.  Despite being relatively short, this book covers a lot of ground, including religion, economy, sexuality, family life, and art.<br />With that said, I must confess a little bit of disappointment with the writing of \\"The Dispossessed\\".  Having read the Earthsea Saga and \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\", I know that LeGuin can do better.  In particular, this book lacks any of the great descriptive passages found in her other works.  A few good word pictures of the unforgiving landscape on Annares would have gone a long way towards making the book more intensely realistic.  Some of the dialogue also falls a little bit short.  Still, I view the book overall as being quite impressive, and a must-read for science fiction fans who like to think.	2003-06-07
US	41549714	R22YTWNKCCCPGF	0380788152	797159023	Wheel of the Infinite	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Outstanding Effort	I've had Martha Wells tagged as an author to watch ever since I read \\"City of Bones\\".  Her latest book, \\"Wheel of the Infinite\\", is a big, ambitious fantasy story; don't be fooled by its relatviely small page count.  It includes a lot if imagination, excellent world-building, and better characters than her previous efforts.  After this, I'm really hoping that Wells will get the recognition she deserves as one of the premier fantasy authors alive today.<br />The story focuses on Maskelle,a priestess who went to exile in disgrace after she misinterpreted a message from 'the Adversary', an ancient spirit that protects the world from evil, and on Rian, her bodyguard, who barely managed to escape a gruesome death in a foreign land.  The society where the story takes place seems roughly based on ancient civilzations in Southeast Asia, a welcome break from the typical Mideivel Europe setting in much of modern fantasy.  A rite known as 'the wheel of the Infinite' is performed every year, and Maskelle's knowledge is needed to combat an apparent attempt to destroy the wheel.  The plot events is this book are densely crammed together, yet it has one of those brilliant \\"aha!\\" conclusions where everything comes together and makes sense in the end.  I also liked the fact that many of the characters and concepts are highly imaginative.  My personal favorite is Gisar, an evil puppet who is constantly attempting to escape from the band of traveling actors that owns him.<br />Oh, and before I forget to mention it, the final hundred pages or so of the book are outstanding.  There aren't many fantasy authors who can write sequences that are genuinely frightening, but Wells pulls it off with grand style.  It's interesting that fantasy genre is currently dominated by big, bulky series that are generally incoherent and filled with lousy writing.  Many of the more talented authors, however, are sticking to relatively short solitary books.  Martha Wells can create more engaging characters,build a better realized world, and spin a more exciting story in three-hundred fifty pages that Jordan, Goodkind, or Lackey can do in thousands.	2003-06-06

After reading \\"The Rules of Ascension\\", I'm still waiting.  It's not a bad work; in fact, it's miles above much of the junk that's been flooding the fantasy genre in recent years.  But it still falls far short of greatness.<br />To be sure, this book shows some improvements over the Lon Tobyn Chronicle.  There's a much more complex plot this time around, with some intrigues that you don't expect, and a bigger, richer cast of characters attempting to throw their weight around.  The story is set in a land called Eibithar.  A conspiracy amongst a race of wizards known as the Qirsi seeks to destabilize the current government as part of their revenge for the defeat of their ancestors centuries ago.  As part of their plot, they use murder and misinformation to set the various royal houses of Eibithar against each other, hoping to cause an outbreak of violence.  The plot moves along at a decent pace, and there is an outstanding battle sequence at the conclusion.<br />The devil, as they say, is in the details.  The problem is the writing and the characters.  While the characters are reasonably complex and original, there's nobody here that you can really get attached to.  Part of the problem lies in the dialogue, which is often stiff and mechanical.  Coe often has his characters simply explain their thoughts and plans in a formulaic way, without adding very many of the tics and nuances that mark a real-life human conversation.  Also, he distracting lists exactly why each character says every line of dialogue that they say, leading to very choppy conversations.  More talented authors such as George R. R. Martin understand that this is not necessary.  There are no lines or passages that stand out and stick in your memory for their greatness.<br />I will probably read the secondinstallment in this series eventually, even though I'm not terribly enthusiastic about it.  I think that this author shows promise.  The root of the problem may be Tor Fantasy, a company which seems to demand that most of its authors produce a completed book each year.  If Coe had more time to edit and rewrite, he might be able to deliver a better overall experience.  In the battle between authors and corporate executives, readers usually end up losing.	2003-05-30
US	41549714	R3454KK4EP2HA3	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	5	8	10	N	N	A Modern Masterpiece	Without any doubt, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is one of the few colossal achievements in the fantasy genre from the last thirty years.  It boldly replays all the significant parts of the Arthurian saga from the perspective of the female characters, focusing mainly on Guinevere and Morgaine.  In Bradley's hands, they become fully rounded characters, as we see how their upbringings and differing worldviews lead up to the roles they play in the story that we all know and love.  None of the minor characters, male or female, are neglected.  They are all developed carefully, with realistic motivations.  In &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, less time is spent on warfare and battles than in most earlier versions, and more is devoted to looking at aspects of medieval society that we rarely hear about, ranging from medicine to religion to childrearing.<br />The first hundred pages of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; are, in my opinion, the best part of the book.  They cover the life of Igraine and of Uther Pendragon, and give a glimpse of what British society was like prior to Arthur's birth.  After that, we get a lengthy section dedicated to Morgaine's training as a priestess on the island of Avalon, and the introduction of Guinevere and Lancelot.  The middle section of the book proceeds at a much slower pace, with lots of attention being paid to the development of all of the main characters.  The story then picks up at the end for a very impressive finish.  I particularly like the beautiful descriptions throughout the book, and the way that different literary elements are blended to create wonderful images.<br />Some readers have commented that the book is anti-Christian.  I have to disagree with this.  It does have some Christian characters who are portrayed negatively, but plenty that are portrayed positively as well.  And although she goes a little bit over the top on a few occasions, Bradley is generally accurate in her depiction of theology in the Middle Ages.  I don't think that she is opposed to Christianity as much as opposed to anyone who has become completely inflexible in their worldview.  This may not be clear at the start of the book, but it is definitely obvious by the end.<br />Bradley began her career writing short stories and then moved on to science fiction novels.  She first became famous with the Darkover series, which is, in all honestly, pretty lousy.  When writing &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, however, she took the time to carefully construct her plot and think through her dialogue and descriptive writing.  The result is one of the masterpieces of modern popular literature, and a work that will certainly be remembered as a fantasy classic for many generations to come.	2003-05-16
US	41549714	R9ZDP67WRB2Y1	0553564943	930626996	Magician: Apprentice	Books	2	6	12	N	N	Should have been better	&quot;Magician: Apprentice&quot; is a good book for the first three hundred or so pages.  After that, though, it starts on a downward spiral.  The story centers around two young boys, Pug and Tomas, who live in a castle on the western edge of civilization.  Pug is training to be a magician, but he struggles with even the simplest spells.  Tomas is a young soldier.  When Pug's mentor Kulgan infers that there will soon be an invasion by powerful wizards from a parallel universe, a group of people from the castle heads off on a journey to warn the King.  Pug and Tomas go along and end up getting caught up in a series of wild adventures.<br />So far, so good.  But the problem is that Feist can't stay focused on his two main characters.  This should be a fairly simple story, right?  We have two young men and we see an epic conflict unfolding as they get caught up in it.  But instead the two of them just sort of disappear after a certain point of the book, while we instead get to see a different battle take place from the perspective of a set of different, and less interesting, characters.  While this book was never going to be a masterpiece, it did have the potential to be a quick and amusing read, perhaps on the same order as David Eddings' books.  The problem is that Feist let the story get away from him.  Also, though there are a few smiles here and there, Feist never really pokes fun at himself quite as mercilessly as Eddings does.  Finally, the blatant way in which &quot;Magician: Apprentice&quot; borrows from Tolkien and other authors becomes harder and harder to ignore as the book goes along.<br />All of which is a shame, because the author really does show some promise.  His dialogue is well written, he includes some good fight scenes and chase sequences, and he has a gift for pacing and springing surprises on you.  Nevertheless, thought it allowed me to waste a few hours of my spare time, I can't honestly recommend this to anybody.	2003-05-08
US	41549714	R1K0S1OA89IOIA	0553572393	710568866	Green Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Excellent sequel	&quot;Green Mars&quot; is a very well-written sequel, and it will definitely satisfy anyone who really liked &quot;Red Mars&quot;.  Much of the book focuses on the continuing terraforming effort on Mars.  Near the start of &quot;Green Mars&quot;, we are introduced to some of the new tactics that are being employed to adjust the Martian atmosphere and surface temperature.  Gigantic roving machines are liberating water from the regolith, and a series of mirrors are placed so as to increase the amount of sunlight incident on the planet.  Robinson's depiction of the scientific reality that would have to underlie a terraforming effort remain convincing throughout this volume.  He keeps a record of how the atmosphere and the surface life forms are changing without ever getting excessively bogged down in the scientific details.<br />The overall story arc in &quot;Green Mars&quot; is still quite strong.  It begins with the news that one of the huge corporations headquartered on Earth is interested in contacting members of the Martian underground, a loose collection of various groups that are considered to be outlaws by the corporate-controlled Martian government.  On Mars, the resistance groups and the Authority figures have reached a sort of stalemate.  Police forces raid several settlements with impunity, but the resistance groups are becoming better organized.  The planning and preparations for another rebellion against the United Nations Authority are a major focus of &quot;Green Mars&quot;.  Robinson gives a great deal of thought to the logistics of such a revolt, and he provides a convincing portrayal of the conflicts between different rebel groups.<br />My biggest gripe with &quot;Green Mars&quot; is that the author seems to be growing a little bit too attached to some of his characters.  We learn early on that the population of Mars has swelled into the millions, both because of immigration from Earth and because of new generations that were born and raised on Mars.But despite this fact, the overwhelming majority of the story is told from the perspective of surviving members of the first hundred, most of whom seem to be running out of interesting things to say.  Only one very brief segment is told from the perspective of someone on the 'other side', a representative from one of the metanational corporations on Earth, and we get fairly few glimpses of what life is like for those born and raised on Mars.  I feel that &quot;Green Mars&quot; could have benefited quite a bit from a broader perspective.  Nevertheless, it is still a quite impressive effort overall, and I am eagerly awaiting a chance to read the final entry in the trilogy	2003-05-05

Okay, so there's this evil overlord, see.  And he wants to take over the world, all right.  But there's this young man who fights to stop him.  And the young man turns out to be the reborn version of an ancient hero, as predicted in legend, see.  And there's a gratuitous love interest thrown in, all right.  And a wise old wizard who's the man's mentor.  And there's...<br />Well, you get the idea of \\"The Runelords\\", the latest unfortunate edition of copycat Tolkien-clone fantasy to mar the once-proud fantasy shelves of bookstores and libraries around the world.  Our hero is Gaborn, a young prince who's riding through the woods of a foreign country when he happens to notice an army of foul-smelling bad guys preparing for an attack.  Gaborn heroically rides to notify the King, but this proves futile as arch-baddie Raj Ahten easily conquers the capitol city and then spends several chapters putting his evilness on full display by tormenting a variety of innocent people.  The central gimmick in this novel is the idea of endowments, a magical process by which qualities can be transferred from one person to another.  For example, if you give an endowments of sight, then you become blind but someone else can see twice as well.  This concept allows the author to easily divide up his characters among good guys who only accept voluntary endowments and bad guys who take endowments by force.  Exactly why anyone would be willing to give up their entire hope of a productive life just to give an endowment is never explained.  Raj Ahten has so many endowments of glamour that anyone who looks at him is forced to obey him, although this inexplicably only works some of the time.  Exactly why nobody ever thought to do this before is never explained either.  But if I tried to list all the plot holes and continuity lapses in this book, we'd be here all day.<br />Astonishingly enough, Farland's writing manages to fall below the very low standard that Robert Jordan and other mediocrities have set for the fantasy genre.  He's unable to create any sense of urgency even though he's supposedly writing about a huge conflict between ultimate good and evil incarnate.  For instance, consider one seen where two characters are in a city that's under siege by an army of monsters and bad guys, yet they keep chatting away as if they don't have a care in the world.  Or consider the fact that after his father is killed, Gaborn can't come up with anything more convincing to say than \\"I reject you, Raj Ahten.  I will destroy you.\\"  We get stupid place names (How on Earth do you pronounce \\"Muyyatin\\"), stupid character names (Steveford Hawk?), bad similes (Gaborn sees a woman with \\"hips moving like boiling waves\\"), misused words (fire is described as \\"topaz\\"), and silly figurative language (\\"He felt sure to the marrow of his bones\\".)  Farland often grows repetitious.  When Gaborn becomes saddened, \\"He felt as if the fabric of his mind ripped.\\"  A little bit later, we get \\"he felt as if the fiber of his sanity was shredded.\\"  The fiber of somebody's sanity has certainly been shredded, but I don't think it's the character.  Oh, and let's not forget nonsense like this:<br />\\"He spurred his horse west, deeper into the forest, shouting, 'Spirits of the wood, I am Gaborn Val Oredn, Prince of Mystarria.  I beg you, protect me!'<br />\\"Even as he called for aid, he knew it would do no good.  The spirits of the dead care nothing for the concerns of mortal men.  If Gaborn attracted their attention, they'd only seek to make sure he joined them in the afterlife.\\" (p. 85)<br />So in the second paragraph, we learn that Gaborn will be killed if the spirits notice him.  But in the first paragraph, he's trying to get the spirits to notice him.  What's up with that?<br />And last but not least, we wouldn't want to forget to mention Farland's social sensibilities.  The bad guys are all dark-skinned and they come from the South, and the archvillainis even named \\"Raj Ahten\\".  All the other bad guys also have names suggestive of Arabic or Hindi origin.  We also get classic stereotypes such as Mr. Ahten maintaining a harem and using opium.  Meanwhile, the White heroes who dwell in the North are universally strong, noble, courageous, courteous, and morally upstanding.  On top of that, we get rampant sexism; the lead female character doesn't do much besides sit around whining while the men do everything that requires effort.  Mr. Farland, if you're reading this, would you please wake up and realize that the 50's are over?	2003-05-01
US	41549714	RL59TCU6EOZJB	0553560735	710568866	Red Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	5	9	13	N	N	Red Mars	The colonization of the Solar System has been a big topic in science fiction for decades, and yet no book on the subject has met with as much success as Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series.  The explanation is simple.  When writing these books, Robinson went to great lengths to include every aspect of how human life would change on another planet.  When describing the first manned mission to Mars and the experience of the &quot;First Hundred&quot; settlers, he looks in depth at all sorts of topics ranging from psychology (How would it feel to be constantly faced by a planet that appeared completely different from Earth?) to the politics of terraforming (Would everybody agree to plans to introduce life and create a biosphere on Mars, or would some people resist?)  Robinson displays solid scientific knowledge in an incredible array of fields, and carefully weaves descriptions of the scientific progress that gets made into the story of the settlers' efforts to colonize the planet.<br />One of the best facets of &quot;Red Mars&quot; is the incredible description of the landscapes of Mars.  Robinson gives a lot of thought to the topic of what the planet would actually look like to explorers standing on it from ground level.  These sequences help set this book apart from other efforts where the planet is simply described as being red and rocky and left at that.  When reading these descriptions, you can't help but share the belief of some of the characters that Mar's desolate terrain has its very own form of beauty.  Of particular note are the landscapes during one character's voyage to the polar ice cap near the start of &quot;Red Mars&quot;, and when a group of characters are navigating a dangerous canyon near the book's conclusion.  Robinson also makes good use of the unique elements of geology and weather on Mars.  For instance, when there's a gigantic dust storm on the planet, he gives convincing portrayals not just of the storm itself, but also of the depressing and claustrophobic effect that it has on the settlers when they aren't able to see more than a few feet when outdoors.<br />The story is told from the perspective of several different characters, each of them being the center of attention for about fifty pages.  Some critics have complained about the quality of characterization in Robinson's books.  It's definitely true that they don't have the same complexity as characters should have in true literature.  However, they are satisfactory for telling the story that the author wants to tell.  When two people have a discussion or argument in &quot;Red Mars&quot;, it actually sounds genuine and convincing, and there are some interesting looks at how differences in policy and worldview affect the relationship between characters.<br />As a conclusion, let me say something in response to those reviewers who insist on judging the book by the author's politics rather than by the content of the book itself.  &quot;Red Mars&quot; contains some amount of political and social commentary, although it occupies only a fairly small portion of the six hundred page work.  For instance, there's a brief section where one character must resolve a dispute between business leaders and laborers who are upset about their living conditions on Mars.  Well, this is just another example of what I mentioned earlier, which is that Robinson carefully considered every aspect of what conditions would be like for early settlers on another planet, and his explanation of the situation struck me as being very realistic.  In Robinson's vision of the future, gigantic corporations work to undermine and supplant national governments on Earth as well as to control Mars; some have complained that this is unrealistic.  But those of us who keep up with world events know that we're already starting to see the beginning of such a trend right now, so there''s nothing unreasonable about predicting that it will continue in the future.	2003-04-30

There isn't anything that is glaringly wrong with \\"Lords of the Sky\\", but there isn't much that's right with it either.  The story is one that any fantasy fan must know by heart.  We start with a young boy named Daviot who lives in a quaint seaside village and knows that his people are threatened by sinister invaders known as the \\"Sky Lords\\".  Daviot soon learns that he has great magical powers, and leaves to be tutored in a foreign city, falls in love with a beautiful woman, makes friends and allies, and learns 'surprising' facts about the history of his people.  Will he and his band of friends be able to unlock the necessary secrets in time to save his homeland from destruction?  I won't give away the ending.  Angus Wells, on the other hand, isn't so conscientious.  He drops blatantly obvious clues almost from the start of the book, so any discerning reader will find it easy to predict not only how the book will end, but also exactly where the heroes will go and what they will do at almost every step along the way.<br />The writing is generally weak, with too much repetition and emphasis on mannerisms rather than character development.  The main character often feels his throat being clogged several times on the same page, and people's faces turn red more times than I can count.  There are many occasions where characters spout dialogue for several pages on end without any attempt to make it sound like real human interaction.  Description is nothing special, and the concluding sequences don't come close to having the narrative power that they should have.  Wells makes the distracting choice of telling some of the story in the first person, but unnecessarily shifting to other viewpoints whenever he grows tired of his main character.<br />It is to the author's misfortune that I picked up this work shortly after finishing Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy, a series of books with a similar plot but vastly superior implementation.  Hobb masterfully blended elements of courtly intrigue into her story, but the few mentions of political manipulations in \\"Lords of the Sky\\" feel tacked-on.  Hobb gave her cast of characters a variety of original and frightening magical talents, but Wells' wizards are limited to old standbys like enhanced memory and shooting bolts of fire.  Most importantly, Hobb actually went into the minds of her characters while Wells is content to stick with stock characters and clich&eacute;s.  I wouldn't deem \\"Lords of the Sky\\" to be the worst book I've ever read, but we're undergoing a golden age of high fantasy right now, and there's no reason for fans of the genre to content themselves with mediocre work like this.gy, a series of books with a similar plot but vastly superior implementation.

I can't comment about the feasibility of nanotechnology as they describe it since that's not my area of expertise.  I can say, however, that their depiction of how the scientific community works and responds to events is completely off base.  To begin with, the story is set about twenty years in the future, when researchers on the Moon discover a gigantic construction being built inside a crater.  They soon discover that it is the work of alien &quot;nanocritters&quot;, tiny self-replicating machines sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.  Authorities on earth recruit a scientist and send her to the Moon to investigate.  Now here's one major problem.  If we ever did encounter a working alien artifact like this, it would be a huge discovery and an enormous group of researchers from around the world would be convened to study it.  Many science fiction authors seem to love the idea of a solitary brilliant scientist who single-handedly solves all the major problems in their story but folks, that's just not the way it works.  There are other mistakes in this book as well, such as a different researcher who endangers the entire world by inexplicably ignoring basic security measures.  Real scientists know better.<br />Other than that, I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a bad attempt at hard science fiction, just a really mediocre one.  Most of the cast of characters is passable, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired.  Rather than trying to end each chapter on a high note, the authors instead usually break with a character chatting or brushing their hair or something.  Most of the dialogue doesn't really sound like people who are actually facing a dangerous crisis.  However, I can't deny that the central idea of alien nanotechnology is pretty cool, and the climactic sequence is well written, although some of the mysteries set forth earlier aren't really explained satisfactorily.  I'm feeling generous today, so three stars.	2003-04-14

Some believe that it's the most vivid and imaginative novel that she's written so far, while others view it as weak and disappointing.  I place myself squarely in the first camp.  I find this book to be a triumph.  It successfully resolves the stories of every character, major and minor, from the first two volumes of the series, while also boldly jumping into a new scope and a new location, and providing some major new people and concepts.  Overall, it's a magnificent conclusion to what will surely be remembered as the best fantasy trilogy of the current generation.<br />The first fifty pages are dedicated to showing Fitz's recovery from the events at the end of the last book.  After restoring his sanity, he sets out with a mission: to kill Regal.  I don't want to give away any more of the plot than that, but I can promise you this much: the third volume of the Farseer Trilogy is much more than just a simple revenge fantasy. <br />Many people have commented on the originality of Hobb's magic system.  In \\"Assassin's Quest\\", Fitz is constantly dueling with the surviving members of Regal's coterie.  A much larger segment of the book is dedicated to the Skill magic and its ramifications than in the first two volumes.  She thoroughly explores the question of what it would mean to not even be safe within your own mind.  The answer is frightening at times, and the integration of this facet of the story makes \\"Assassin's Quest\\" even more suspenseful than \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" and \\"Royal Assassin\\".  The Wit magic makes another appearance as well, of course, and we garner quite a bit of new information about how it works and who can use it.<br />Another thing I liked about this book was the way that storylines from the distant past were worked into the plot without interrupting it.  There are no history lectures.  Instead, Hobb actually devises convincing ways to make past events work togetherwith what's happening in the present.  Her storytelling shows quite clearly that she planned this entire trilogy out right from the beginning.  Little details from the first two books resurface to prove their significance here.  I can't quit without mentioning her amazing writing talent, of course.  In this book even more than in the first two, she shows a unique (among fantasy authors at least) gift for picking the right word at the right time.  Despite the vastly changing scenery, she provides moving and convincing descriptions for every location.  Her dialogue is very carefully laid out, and she brings all of the characters to life with believable emotions and reactions to events.	2003-04-12

The area where this book really stands out is imagination.  No yawn-inducing clichés, no predictable plotting, no tired language.  Instead we get armored polar bears who will fight honorably for the right price (or at least they're supposed to), animal daemons who represent a person's inner soul, and parallel universes that offer the possibility of world-changing discoveries.  There are two things that are amazing about the story arc in this book.  First is the enormous amount of material, including plotting, description, and characterization, that Pullman fits into just four hundred pages.  Second is the way that the novel keeps morphing into a new form while still remaining a coherent piece of literature.  It starts out as a mystery about the disappearance of groups of children from various cities in England.  It then shifts to an adventure story as the girl named Lyra joins a rescue mission to the far North.  Near the end it seems more like a philosophical novel, but don't worry, there's still an action-packed climax waiting in the final pages.<br />Of course, no review of \\"The Golden Compass\\" could be complete without some mention of the subject matter.  Pullman's stroke of genius is to take abstract concepts that the major western religions have always been centered around, such as the soul and sin, and give them physical form, and then portray how religious institutions might react to that.  His book analysis of religion and philosophy from this angle is never dumbed-down, and he doesn't shy away from the implications of the events and concepts that he's created.  Regardless of whether or not you agree with Pullman's worldview, you have to grant that he makes you think about these questions in a new light, which is more than canbe said for most fantasy authors in either the 'children' or the 'adult' sections.	2003-04-09

We get a mystery that's not mysterious and a suspense story that's not suspenseful.  But let me back up for a minute.  The story concerns airline pilot Rayford Steele and ace reporter Cameron 'Buck' Williams, both of whom are on board a transatlantic flight when many of the passengers are raptured away.  For those not familiar with the terminology, the rapture is part of an interpretation of bible which predicts, among other things, that all the true Christians in the world will spontaneously disappear from Earth and be transported to Heaven.  Rayford returns home to Illinois where he soon learns that his wife has vanished; luckily, her pastor sticks around so he can finish up the conversion business.  Meanwhile, Buck heads to New York and then England to investigate a suspicious death.<br />Surprising enough, Rayford turns out to be a respectable character, and his internal religious experiences are decently realistic.  On the other hand, Buck Williams is about as convincing as your average used car salesman.  Consider that in the space of about a week he survives a full-scale war, experiences a worldwide cataclysm, sees a friend get murdered, barely escapes being framed for that murder, covers the toppling of a government, and reacts to all of this as if it's a walk in the park.  None of his dialogue every comes close to sounding like a normal human being, much less like anybody who's undergoing heavy stress and life-threatening experiences.  I should add at this point that Jenkins' attempts to add slang to their dialogue are downright laughable, since the words they use are usually fake-sounding or outdated(\\"Haywire\\"? \\"Confab\\"?? \\"Scuttlebutt\\"?!?)<br />So the authors deep-six any hope they have of achieving literary merit, but they still could come up with a decent piece of mystery/spy fiction.  The problem is that their plot intrigues are a lit bit too outlandish, with improbable conspiracy theories and even more improbable behavior.  For instance, what's the probability that every bank in the United States is actually secretly controlled by the same individual?  Or that a highly sophisticated assassination that was supposed to look like a suicide would be easily seen through because major details were botched?<br />Let me add one comment on the book's religious angle.  You may have frequently heard the claim that \\"Left Behind\\" is a well-researched book that carefully follows the prophecies of Revelations and other portions of the Bible.  In reality, it's only intended to satisfy those who have just a passing knowledge of the prophetic texts.  For instance, consider the prediction that Israel will be attacked by Gog, the Biblical name for the Middle Eastern tribes of Meshech and Tubal (Ezekiel 38:2).  The problem is that even if these two tribes ever existed, which is doubtful, they were wiped out years ago.  LaHaye and Jenkins skirt this problem by declaring that in their version of events, Gog is Russia instead, and they then have Russia launch a massive attack against Israel for no particular reason.  Of course, people such as the notorious Hal Lindsey have spent tremendous effort trying to prove that modern-day Russians are actually the descendants of Meshech and Tubal, but such claims would never hold water with people who have any understanding of Russian history.  In summary, I advise you to not even bother with this one.  Too long, too preachy, too far-fetched.	2003-03-31

It's a startling book, which breaks with conventions at almost every possible opportunity.  There's true intrigue and suspense here, a fast-moving plot, and a real permeating sense of danger throughout.  For once I can wholeheartedly recommend this one to just about anybody.<br />The book starts when a teenage hunter named Alec is imprisoned and tortured by guards after he accidentally wanders onto private land.  He escapes with the assistance of a fellow prisoner named Seregil, who offers to take Alec on as an apprentice bard.  However, Seregil isn't who he appears to be.  More and more facets of his mysterious past and dangerous mission are revealed as the two of them break into a foreign visitor's room and steal a mysterious token, then have to go on the run with an entire army on their heals.  Admittedly this plot summary may not sound too different from some typical genre fantasy, but Flewelling's skill at character development lifts it above the rest.  Alec and Seregil are not merely caricatures; they are fully fleshed-out and realistic people.  Alec lost his father right before the beginning of the book.  Unlike certain other authors, Flewelling doesn't simply have him ignore the traumatic experiences that he went through.  She acknowledges that losing family members and having your life ripped apart has psychological effects that don't simply disappear after a few days.  Alec's need to rebuild his place in society and find a new family haunts him for the rest of the book.<br />The plot really moves into high gear when Seregil is attacked by hostile magic, in a form that causes eventual madness and violent behavior.  His attempt to battle against encroaching insanity, while Alec tries to locate the famed wizard Nysander, who may be able to cure him, is the high point of the book, and it leads to a sort of mini-climax within the first two hundred pages.  After that portion of the plot is resolved, there are countless other threads still hanging around.  The good guys have to deal with spies in their midst, impending foreign invasion, and the threat of more hostile magic by a mysterious and sinister figure.  There's so much going on in \\"Luck in the Shadows\\" that it's amazing that the author can handle it all in less than five hundred pages.  But she does, and in grand style.  The ending is a classic that provides a satisfying conclusion while still leaving some questions open for the sequels.  Above all else, it should be noted that the forces of evil in this book are truly frightening, rather than just being cardboard cutouts who act bad because the plot requires it.<br />I had previously read the first book in Flewelling's other series, \\"The Bone Doll's Twin\\", and thought that it was a good effort, but had some major flaws.  \\"Luck in the Shadows\\", however, is a much more complete work, one where the author took the time to get all of the details right.  Tough I know that some such promise is made concerning every new fantasy author, I feel that she really will come to be viewed as one of the major authors of the genre, and that the Nightrunner series will be a classic for future generations.	2003-03-24

Endlessly imaginative and inventive, suspenseful, darkly humorous, and at times even romantic, this is a novel that truly has it all.<br />Our leading character is Finn of Fyxedia, a lizard maker who gets chosen by an eccentric prince to deliver one of his creations as a gift to the King in the rival country of Heldessia.  Finn flies over the war zone is a balloon and crash-lands, barely escaping death at the hands of a group of dog-like thugs whose job is to assassinate the King on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Finn's lover, a Mycer woman (that means a half-mouse, half-human, product of an ancient experiment in sorcery) named Letitia Louise, follows him to Heldessia in hopes of protecting him and helping him to complete his assignment.  The plot skips nimbly around, never getting bogged down in any one place or idea.  I was pleased to find that the ending was the first time in quite a while where I actually cared about what happened to the characters in a fantasy novel.<br />But most importantly, Barrett's writing is relentlessly clever.  He has a gift for perfect word choice, a talent for dialogue, and a cynical sense of humor along the same lines as Douglas Adams.  Although he's never been a best-seller, Barrett has an impressive list of works, and he unquestionably deserves credit as one of the best modern fantasy authors.	2003-03-17
US	41549714	R3UFZ7S5IQM34G	0812522400	629033060	Lord of the Isles	Books	1	13	23	N	N	Tor Fantasy: The Axis of Awful	Some books reviews call for subtlety, but in this case I think I'll cut directly to the chase. \\"Lord of the Isles\\" is one of the worst pieces of nonsensical drivel ever written. David Drake's writing is confusing, silly, and immature all at once. The book is filled with grammar errors. This was, apparently, another case of the editor being out to lunch on a major fantasy novel. There are times when it seems like he's simply throwing words together at random with zero thought. For instance, he uses the phrase \\"waxen darkness\\". How on earth is it possible for darkness to be waxen? This happens several times per page, not just once in a while. Drake's inability to keep track of what he's written is enough to drive you insane. For example, there's one scene where a character remarks that she's never even heard of a particular city before. Half a page later she starts lecturing somebody else about the history of that city. Gaping plot holes and flaws in the story's logic, choppy writing with chapters that are only two or three pages long, and random appearances of new characters and concepts without any explanation are all apparent throughout the book.<br />Characterization is all but nonexistent. If young people living in a tiny isolated village suddenly had their lives turned upside down by strangers and were forced to undertake dangerous journeys, there are certain feelings that you'd expect them to have: surprise, fear, loneliness, homesickness, and so forth. In \\"Lord of the Isles\\", most of the characters don't experience any emotions whatsoever. They drift through the book witnessing astonishing and frightening events without even the slightest reaction. Unbelievable stupidity is about the only defining characteristic of every person. For example, when a group gets shipwrecked in territory that they now is controlled by hostile forces who want them dead, they don't make any attempt to hide or protect themselves, but instead walk right into the clutches of the bad guys. Their captor knows that one of them is a powerful wizard, but doesn't even try to stop the wizard from using magic to free them, and so forth. Drake devotes almost zero space to descriptive writing, making it nearly impossible to visualize what is happening during the action scenes that occur roughly once every five pages. The fight scenes themselves are laughable. I've complained before about how many fantasy novels have cheesy, unrealistic depictions of fighting, but this book tops them all. I lost track of how many times one of the naive farmers just picked up a weapon and beat the stuffing out of an entire mob of well-trained soldiers. \\"Lord of the Isles\\" suffers from the worst case of lack of plot continuity I've ever seen. At one point a group of characters are on a raft near an island called Tegma. The next time that we see them, the raft has suddenly moved hundreds of miles north, apparently crossing an area of dry land in the process, and there's no explanation for how it happened.<br />I could go on listing problems, but I think that you get the point by now, so I'll conclude with a few words about Tor Fantasy, the company that published this stinker. Fifteen years ago, Tor was just one of the many companies struggling along in the fantasy field. In 1989, however, they hit pay dirt with Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. Since then, they seem to have decided that the fastest way to money is simply to find authors whose only 'talent' is the ability to copy down the Wheel of Time while changing the names and a few minor details. Here are just a few of the similarities between \\"The Eye of the World\\" and \\"Lord of the Isles\\":<br />Both books focus on and are told from the perspective of four people in their upper teens who live in a quaint, isolated village, but who are forced to take a journey to somewhere else and get caught up in larger events.<br />In both books, the action begins when a well-dressed older woman arrives from out of town. In both cases, the woman turns out to be a powerful wizard, although we don't learn the true extent of her magical power until much later.<br />In \\"The Eye of the world\\", the archvillain is 'The Dark One'. In \\"Lord of the Isles\\", it's 'The Hooded One'. In both cases, this very bad person is making a second go-round at conquering the world because his first attempt failed several thousand years ago. In both cases, the hero of the book turns out to be a resurrected version of the ancient leader who defeated the bad guy way back then.<br />Likewise, Drake copies Jordan's inept dialogue, overwritten dream sequences, inability to create a female character who isn't bossy and arrogant, etc... I could gripe further, but what's the point? Tor will continue to support these copy artists until the audience finally wises up and stops buying their work. Until then, those of us who want originality and intelligence will just have to seek out other publishing houses.	2003-03-13

Eddings' skill at handling the nuts-and-bolts issues of writing shows through even more than it did in &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot;.  He understands that he should never spend more than five pages on any particular scene, and he realizes that importance of injecting a good action scene every few chapters to break up the dialogue.  But above all else, Eddings has the saving grace of not taking himself too seriously.  For instance, consider a new character who comes on board at the start and spends the entire book talking in mock-Shakespearian, with lots of &quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot; and &quot;forsooths&quot;.  If the author was actually taking this seriously, it would be almost unendurable.  But since he knows that it's all in good fun, we can laugh at it too.  Overall, highly enjoyable, and I'm very much looking forward to reading the next installment.	2003-03-08
US	41549714	R2RCLV6UTR5HJY	0812555473	532922613	In Legend Born	Books	1	28	45	N	N	Beyond merely awful	After reading the glowing reviews on this page, I'm honestly wondering whether I actually read the same novel as the people who poured out all those glowing five-star tributes.  The book that I read was among the sorriest, most pathetic pieces of garbage ever written. \\"In Legend Born\\" is not a good book. It is not even a competent book. It's an exercise in overdone clichés, weak characters, and plain, old-fashioned stupidity.<br />Our first character is Mirabar, a young female outcast who's capable of communicating with the dead, who inhabit yet another irritatingly ambiguous spirirt world. She receives a prophecy about a brave warrior who's going to arrive and liberate the people of Sileria from their oppressors, the Valdani. Next we are introduced to Tashen, a brave warrior who's just arrived to liberate the people of Sileria from the Valdani. In case you're too brain-dead to figure out that Tashen is the person who Mirabar saw in her vision, Resnick is very careful to spell it out again and again for the next two-hundred pages or so before she 'reveals' the big 'secret'. Anyway, Tashen hooks up with an angry peasant named Josarian (the name choice may be a reference to \\"Catch-22\\"), they raise an army and join forces with some friendly wizards and start to pummel the crap out of the Valdani. And I do mean pummel. The good guys win every single battle in the entire book with ease, regardless of the circumstances. We're expected to believe that a band of peasants with zero fighting experience would have no trouble slaughtering an entire army of trained soldiers. It's at times like this that you really wish that fantasy authors could be bothered to do a little bit of research before they begin writing. In real life, it takes years of training before you can learn how to use a sword or a bow properly. Resnick's vision of fighting is so off-base that at one point she even has a warrior single-handedly kill off seventeen guards (!) at one time while barely being touched. Some people may like the cheesy Hollywood vision of swordfighting; I prefer authors who at least attempt to put a little realism into it.<br />But as bad as the fight sequences are, they're unquestionably more enjoyable than the rest of the book. Resnick provides the villainous Valdani with a long laundry list of sins: murder, genocide, torture, slavery, rape, high taxes, and religious persecution, to name a few, and she carefully eliminates any traces of any redeeming characteristics from all of them. The problem, of course, is that good villains need both good and bad traits so that we can watch a slower and more believable descent into evil. Authors who go so completely overboard in vilifying their bad-guy characters usually just end up embarrassing themselves. In addition, she goes to great lengths to emphasize the fact that every single Valdani is as dumb as a brick, leaving us to wonder how they came to control a gigantic empire when clearly not even one of them is smart enough to control their own sock drawer. As you can probably guess, all of the heroes turn out to be paragons of virtue, and largely devoid of any real personality. Oh, Resnick tries to make them interesting, but she just can't do it. For instance, Josarian was supposedly driven into recklessness by the recent death of his wife. In practice, the author completely forgets about the wife for most of the book, and then she suddenly pops up to drive him \\"insane with longing\\" at seemingly random points. The author's attempts to add humor by means of Josarian's horny cousin Zimran are best left unmentioned, and her romance scenes ... Oh, dear God! Better to not write any at all than to write ones this bad.<br />I could go on griping about the overall stupidity of this book, but I think that you get the point by now. The important question is, is it worth reading? Is it entertaining? The answer is no. \\"In Lengend Born\\" in dreary and dull, includes tons of filler material, and the final hundred pages aren't a conclusion as much as an advertisement for the next volume. While I'll admit that there are a very few interesting plot intrigues and a couple of fairly touching scenes, they don't justify the book's gigantic length (730 pages), and as with Robert Jordan and all his other clones, Resnick's big blocks of dialogue should have edited, preferably with a blowtorch. Apparently there are some people who are eagerly anticipating the appearance of a sequel. Personally, I'll wait patiently for the next works by George R. R. Martin or Robin Hobb, and do my best to banish all memories of this particularly monumental mistake.	2003-03-04

No.  But &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot; is a quick and entertaining excursion into high fantasy that's well worth reading.  What it lacks in originality, which is quite a bit, it makes up for in fast moving plot and good storytelling.  This book is a much better buy than the eight-hundred page doorstoppers that have taken over the fantasy genre during the last fifteen years.  It doesn't have any uselessly gigantic blocks of dialogue or huge history lectures (other than the prologue) that certain other authors feel a need to take our time with. The plot jumps briskly from point to point and keeps us interested up to the end.  I can't praise the writing all that highly, but at least it doesn't descend into total silliness.<br />Our main character is Garion, a seemingly ordinary boy who lives on a massive farm under the supervision of his aunt Pol.  He goes through the rituals of boyhood, along with a few strange events such as seeing black horsemen that nobody else notices.  Of course, he's eventually forced to flee the farm and gets caught up in a world-changing series of events.  It's interesting to watch Eddings' writing technique in this first section of the book.  We know that some major event involving Garion will take place eventually, but the author still manages to catch us by surprise with its timing and placement in the story.  For the rest of the book, he uses the same sort of style.  The revelations about major characters who aren't what they seem are handled pretty well, the scenes of action and intrigue are above average.  Overall, highly recommended.	2003-02-27
US	41549714	R17UTU88XPZYMO	0886778034	115704408	Owlsight: Book Two of  Darian's Tale (The Owl Mage Trilogy)	Books	1	10	15	N	N	Going from bad to worse	I first picked up the Darian's Tale series because I thought that any fantasy author who takes up a great deal of shelf space in bookstores and libraries, as Mercedes Lackey always does, must be at least a competent writer.  Of course, you would think that after my unfortunate encounters with Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind I would have learned my lesson.  Anyway, &quot;Owlflight&quot; was mediocre, but &quot;Owlsight&quot; is much, much worse.  There's much discussion among fans of the genre about the fact that many of the most popular authors can't seem to find a decent editor.  &quot;Owlsight&quot; is an excellent showcase of this trend.  The book is rife with errors in grammar and punctuation.  There are awkward sentences (&quot;There just wasn't enough readily available magic energy available to do such a task.&quot;) and inapt metaphors (&quot;She felt as if her nerves had been rubbed raw and somebody was pouring saltwater on them.&quot;)  The writing feels completely shoddy and hasty, especially when we get descriptions of people's clothes that go on for pages and sound more gaudy and tasteless than anything that the most incompetent fashion designer could come up with, or when we have to endure speeches about various trite morals, such &quot;war is bad&quot; and &quot;judging people is bad&quot;.  Normally editors are supposed to flag down all of this.  When authors grow powerful enough to muscle past the editorial process, they risk embarrassing themselves, which is certainly what happened to Lackey and Dixon in &quot;Owlsight&quot;.<br />If we look past the lousy writing, what do we find?  Not much.  I complained that the plot of &quot;Owlflight&quot; was slow.  In this book, it's almost nonexistent.  The first three-hundred pages are spent entirely on introducing the two main characters and showing us many, many, many scenes of them chatting with friends, eating, and otherwise going through the motions of an ordinary day.  We have Darian, who's still hanging out with the Hawkbrothers and endlessly ruminating about unworthy and inferior he is.  And then we have the healer Keisha, who is hanging out in Errold's Grove and endlessly ruminating about how unworthy and inferior she is.  The new army of barbarians doesn't show up until almost the end of the book, and the authors' method for dealing with them sounds forced and unrealistic.  After four-hundred-and-fifty pages, &quot;Owlsight&quot; limps to a close without giving us a proper climactic showdown, or even a single action scene.  At no point do we ever get a decent portrait of any character.  You would think that right before a showdown with a large and possibly dangerous army, these teenagers would be at least a little bit nervous, right.  But in &quot;Owlsight&quot;, they act like it's a walk in the park.<br />I don't think that I'll even bother reading the final volume of this syrupy series.  After all, don't we all know how it's going to end?  Darian and Keisha will fall madly in love, but it will somehow take them several hundred pages to express their feeling for each other.  Meanwhile, a new bunch of bad guys will show up from somewhere, but our heroes will once again find a clever way to deal with them, and all will be right with the world.  Yawn.  I have better things to do with my time than sitting around reading predictable claptrap like this.	2003-02-21
US	41549714	R1CWI6DJHRJSG4	0553577239	76171339	The Bone Doll's Twin (Tamir Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good Stuff	\\"The Bone Doll's Twin\\" begins with two wizards, Iya and Arkoniel, who are charged with an unpleasant task.  Erius, the King of the land of Skala, has been exterminating all of his female relatives in order to prevent them from challenging his claim to the throne.  To save Erius' infant niece, Iya and Arkoniel must employ a form of magic to transform the child's body into a male for an indefinite period of time.  Unfortunately, this action necessitates killing the girl's twin brother, and the two wizards are unable to prevent his spirit from escaping and haunting the household.  After this introduction, most of the book is spent showing the girl, raised as the Prince Tobin, growing up in a small castle in a remote part of the country.<br />This book has quite a bit going for it.  Flewelling does an excellent job of capturing a sense of gritty reality.  Life in a medieval society, even for lords and royalty, was never as pleasant as the way that many authors portray it.  There was always a threat of disease and hunger, and, of course, people in those times lacked many of our modern conveniences.  This books spares no details in presenting the truth about life in those times.  All of the characters in this book are solid.  I particularly enjoyed the portrayals of Arkoniel and Iya.  Instead of just using the stereotypical wizard character (old, wise guy with beard and funny language), Flewelling gives each of them a unique and unpredictable personality.  Tobin is also quite different from the overused 'young boy who's destined for greatness' character.  I should also say that the writing has a very nice flow, and that the author does a good job a covering large amounts of time in relatively little space.<br />And yet, there's something a little bit unsatisfying about \\"The Bone Doll's Twin\\", particularly during the final fifty pages or so.  I think that what really bothered me was that the author didn't explore the book's full potential, and didn't manage to create a truly dark and frightening mood.  Now there are a few genuinely creepy scenes in here; see especially one near the end where Tobin encounters the evil wizard Niryn in his family's graveyard at night.  But for most of the time there just isn't enough of a sense of imminent danger.  In particular, the scenes featuring the ghost of the murdered child fall short of what they could be.  And then there's the concluding scene.  I don't want to give it away, so I'll just say that it rings false.  Flewelling builds up a fascinating situation for one of the characters, but then that person's reaction to it just isn't believable.<br />So, what's the final analysis?  Well, \\"The Bone Doll's Twin\\" is an excellent book, and I'll be the first in line when the sequel comes out.  In my opinion, however, the author did pass up some good opportunities.	2003-02-16
US	41549714	R33BDXJ1AD299N	0886778042	450394482	Owlflight (Valdemar: Darian's Tale, Book 1)	Books	2	6	11	N	N	Decidedly mediocre	&quot;Owlflight&quot; isn't the worst fantasy novel that I've ever read, it's just the most unnecessary one.  Rebellious thirteen-year-old Darian is an apprentice wizard in the remote village of Emmond's Grove.  One day the town is attacked by barbarians, and Darian barely manages to escape after his mentor, Justyn sacrifices himself to delay the approaching army.  Fleeing into the woods, Darian meets a band known as the Hawkbrothers.  They talk for awhile, there's a climactic battle, and, needless to say, Darian's courage and new magic powers turn out to be the key to defeating the bad guys, after which everybody lives happily until the sequel.  The point is that we've seen this entire book before, countless times.  The authors are utterly unable to dredge up as much as one unique element in the entire story.  The characters, plot, settings, and everything else seem like they were borrowed from earlier works, and everything is completely predictable, to the point where you're almost able to predict exactly how many paragraphs will be spent on each blazingly obvious plot point before moving on to the next one.<br />I'll admit that the authors do a reasonably good job of capturing the emotional turbulence of an teenager who's lost his parents, but other than that, the writing in &quot;Owlflight&quot; is embarrassingly bad.  The dialogue never even comes close to sounding like normal conversational speech (how many thirteen-year-olds do you know who say 'intoxicated' rather than 'drunk'?)  Also, the authors don't maintain a good balance between internal introspection and plot movement.  &quot;Owlflight&quot; is 350 pages long and contains only three action scenes.  Most of the space in between is spent on characters endlessly wondering what they should say or do, wondering how other people will react to what they say or do, wondering how people have reacted to what they just said or did, and inevitably taking ten pages to communicate even the simplest point.<br />Somepeople might defend &quot;Owlflight&quot; on the grounds that it's aimed at a 'young adult' audience, and thus shouldn't be judged by the same standards as real fantasy novels.  My response to this is that there are plenty of authors out there who are capable of writing books that appeal to all age groups.  I've never understood why some people insist that anyone under the age of fifteen should be satisfied with inferior work.  Readers in that age group are actually capable of distinguishing good and bad books.  If they get fed only predictable, mediocre nonsense like &quot;Owlflight&quot;, they're likely to quit the fantasy genre before they even have a chance to read some of the world's greatest books.	2003-02-09
US	41549714	R2JYL06YYQPEMH	0812550757	241285325	Speaker for the Dead (The Ender Quintet)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A complete work in itself	Orson Scott Card came up with the central idea of &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; before &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, and after you read both books you'll understand why he originally thought of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; as just an introduction.  The two books are separate works that share only their one major character.  &quot;Speaker&quot; is set three-thousand years later, when Ender is still alive because of the relativistic effects of space travel.  He's spent the time wandering among various planets settled by humans and speaking the deaths of various people, a newly invented ritual where he attempts to tell the deceased's entire life story from an impartial perspective.  On the planet of Lusitania, meanwhile, humanity has encountered a new and intelligent, but technologically primitive species known as the Pequinos.  Because the destruction of the Buggers is now viewed as the worst crime in human history, this new lifeform is seen as a chance for redemption.<br />&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is a big, ambitious work, and its topics and goals are very different from those in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.  While the idea of alien contact does get mentioned quite a bit, large portions of the book are also focused on the experiences of one particular family whose members work with the Pequinos.  Religion plays a big role in this book, and Card has a unique vision of how authority, in terms of both church and government, will be organized in the future.  Like all of the very best science fiction novels, &quot;Speaker of the Dead&quot; presents us with a lot of original insights about the future of human society, and raises countless questions that are relevant to us today.<br />Card's writing is, needless to say, outstanding.  While reading &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, I was constantly stunned by his accurate dialogue, and by the way that he is able to bring a huge and diverse cast of characters to life.  It's interesting to note that Card spends almost no timeon descriptions, yet he still effectively communicates the look and feel of almost every location in the book.  &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; shows us one of the greatest authors of a generation at the top of his game; it's a book that nobody should miss.	2003-02-06

Yes, it is.  &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; is a big, sweeping, impressive novel.  George R. R. Martin displays an excellent sense of showmanship in this volume, making almost every scene more enjoyable.  The pace is up, the action is fierce, and the surprises just keep on happening.<br />In contrast to &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, where the story crept by pretty slowly for the first eight-hundred pages and then went into high gear at the end, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; starts off with a bang, or perhaps I should say several bangs, and never slows down.  In King's Landing, Sansa Stark meets with the Tyrell family and is soon engaged to be married to the Lord of Highgarden.  North of the Wall, the Rangers battle an army of Wights at the Fist of the Firstmen, an encounter from which few survive.  Lady Catelyn releases Jaime Lannister from Riverrun after making him swear an oath to return her daughters alive.  Jorah Mormont convinces Daenerys Targaren to take an unexpected detour rather than sailing to meet Magister Illyrio at Braavos.  And all of this is just in the first hundred pages.  Now you may think that I've given away some key plot points here, but I promise that I haven't.  You'll understand why when you read the book.<br />All of our favorite characters return for more adventures, although remarkably few of them remain alive by the end of the book.  But best of all, Martin takes some of the people that we thought we knew and sends them in surprising new directions.  For instance, Jon Snow remains loyal to the Seven Kingdoms and most of the oaths that he swore; that's not too surprising.  But the sequence of events that he takes part in is extraordinary.  You'll never be able to guess what happens to him by the time that the novel ends.  It also notable that we get some chapters from the perspective of Jaime Lannister, and he turns out to have a much different personality than what you might expect.  We see Catelyn growing increasingly depressed and desperate as she waits for news of Sansa and Arya, though that's certainly not all that happens to her.  Tyrion's chapters, which again show him navigating the court intrigues in King's Landing, are, for some reason, for fun than they were in &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;.  Another very good thing about this book, though, is that by the end of it Martin seems to be promising that he'll send some of the characters off to new adventures in places that we haven't seen before.<br />Martin keeps the quality of the storytelling high throughout.  Unlike some fantasy authors, he clearly puts a considerable amount of thought into every conversation.  We barely see any amount of space wasted on unnecessary material, and the characters to generally act in believable ways.  For instance, children in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; behave like children, rather than like small adults.  They often act without much logic or foresight, and have a childish set of priorities.  Another aspect of the story where Matin does well is in analyzing the psychology of the characters involved.  He understands that fighting in a war for years on end wears people down, that losing family members is not an easy experience to overcome, and so forth.  Also, he shows the fact that kings and other leaders have to take such factors into account in order to prevent revolts by their own underlings.  Overall, the writing in this book is high-quality, and I'm eagerly anticipating &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;.	2003-02-02

The narrator and main character, Rali Anterro of the Maranon Guard, is a lot more likeable than Amalric from &quot;The Far Kingdoms&quot;, since she has a real personality and some actually feelings, as well as more interesting relationships with other people.  Perhaps more importantly, the plot has some real unpredictability to it, with the heroes facing a number of different villains and dangerous situations, and sometimes having to use more than just random luck to survive.  Also, the authors include at least a little bit of humor, something that was sorely absent in &quot;The Far Kingdoms&quot;, and in general they simply manage to give the story more life this time around.	2003-01-26

When I finally managed to get a copy of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\", I thought that it started off pretty slowly, but by the time that I reached the ending, I had been completely pulled in.  This really is one of the greatest achievements in the fantasy genre from the last twenty years, and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed if you try it.<br />The plot centers around the narrator, FitzChivalry Farseer, a bastard of the royal family in the Six Duchies who is brought to live in his family's castle at age six.  At first, he works as a stable-boy, but later his grandfather, King Shrewd, explains that a king can never waste an opportunity, so he has Fitz trained in fighting, academics, and the art of the assassin.  From that point on, he gets caught up in royal intrigues, as his two uncles both attempt to guarantee that they will succeed Shrewd to the throne, while mysterious 'Outislanders' are attacking the coastline.  Fitz gains even more enemies once he starts to train in 'the Skill', a type of magic that allows mind control and communication over large distances.  The climactic showdown of this volume is truly wonderful to read, full of surprises, narrow escapes, and double-crosses.<br />I've thought a great deal about what makes this book, and this series, so special, and why intelligent fans flock to Hobb's work rather than the tons of low-rent fantasy that's been churned out lately.  One thing that must surely strike all readers is Hobb's attention to character development.  Everybody in the book thinks, talks, and acts like a real human being, rather than like the typical automatons that we find in countless other books.  While we don't see as many complete characters as we do in Hobb's other big series, The Liveship Traders, we do atleast come to care about what happens to Fitz and his friends.<br />Another, and perhaps a more important strong point, is that Hobb actually understands what life was like in Medieval societies, and incorporates this understanding into her story.  For instance, we learn that there is a type of magic that allows some people to form mental links with certain animals, and also that the law in the Six Duchies requires that anyone who gets caught practicing it will be put to death.  Of course, people in Medieval times actually were very superstitious and paranoid, and that's probably how they would have reacted to such a form of magic.	2003-01-22

While it is worth reading, it's not up to the same standard as &quot;Ship of Magic&quot; or &quot;Mad Ship&quot;. Hobb does bring a conclusion of sorts to the series, but a lot of the book seems to be either too silly or too forced to fit in with the first two volumes. &quot;Ship of Destiny&quot; does have some good moments, but I really expected something better from this work. <br />We start where &quot;Mad Ship&quot; left off, with Bingtown mostly destroyed while in Trehaug, Reyn has just managed to release Tintaglia, the last dragon. Farther south, Vivacia is struggling with the knowledge of where wizardwood comes from, while Althea and Brashen try to figure out how to locate Kennit and get their ship back. I realize that it must be difficult to successfully wrap up a story where so many different things are happening, but the plot of &quot;Ship of Destiny&quot; really seems to rely too heavily on amazing coincidences. A huge group of characters all meet at the same place and time by random chance, a character avoids a difficult dilemma because two events conveniently happen at the same time, and so forth. <br />Like most readers, I think that characterization is one of Hobb's biggest strengths. There are some characters in &quot;Ship of Destiny&quot; who manage to remain both believable and sympathetic, most notably Althea, Ronica, and Brashen. However, some of the others seem to have their personalities change so fast that it's not really credible. I wouldn't necessarily say that the author does a bad job with characterization in this book, just that it appear a little bit hasty and sloppy at times. Another gripe that I have is that all of the resolutions reached among various groups that help bring about the happy ending are a bit of a stretch. For instance, all of the groups in Bingtown, including the Old Traders, New Traders, former slaves, and Three Ships families, are surprisingly willing to put aside their differences and get along with each other considering the distrust and animosity that they showed in the last book. <br />Other than those complaints, &quot;Ship of Destiny&quot; is still a pretty strong book compared to the rest of the fantasy genre. Hobb's writing is still adept, and she has an excellent ear for dialogue. And there are some well-written scenes in this book where you actually feel for the characters and experience some suspense about what will happen next. For those who enjoyed the first two volumes of the Liveship Traders series, I certainly wouldn't discourage you from tackling this one as well. I just think that it's generally below the level of quality that we've come to expect from Hobb.	2003-01-18

That's about the only way to say it.  As a sequel, it strikes just the right balance between keeping up all the old plotlines and introducing us to new people and places.  Just like in \\"Ship of Magic\\", the writing is fantastic and the sense of adventure, mystery, and romance is very real.<br />\\"Mad Ship\\" begins with Althea returning home to Bingtown to learn that the Vivacia still hasn't returned.  Of course, the ship is still in the hands of Captain Kennit, who appears to be facing death since he hasn't recovered from the serpent bite.  The Vestrits finally learn what happened when Brashen, who saw the Vivacia when he was visiting the Pirate Islands, brings them the news.  In this volume, we also get some passages told from the perspective of Reyn Khuprus, the Rain Wild trader, and we come closer to learning where the liveships come from and how this all relates to the fate of the great sea serpents.  Yet another plotline follows one of the Satrap's advisors in Jamailla.<br />The really good thing about \\"Mad Ship\\" is that Hobb isn't content to simply keep doing what she did in \\"Ship of Magic\\".  Instead, she brings out several new mysteries and takes the story in surprising directions.  Some of the best scenes in this book come at the very end, when the differing plotlines are starting to come together, and the characters that we know so well show that they still have some surprises waiting for us.  I really enjoy the unpredictability of Hobb's writing, and the sense that anything could happen at any time.<br />Some people might complain that this book is too long and that at the beginning, it moves too slowly.  But the point that they're missing is that this is mostly a character-driven novel.  Hobb includes a lot of passages that let us see into the minds of the characters and learn not just what they do, but why they do it.  This is another one of the facets that makes her writing so special.	2003-01-07
US	41549714	R156VTK451G0KN	0553579908	153810577	A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A good sequel	The bottom line: \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is good, but not as good as the original.  It has the same basic structure as \\"A Game of Thrones\\", told in short chapters from many different viewpoints.  Since the scope of the novel is a bit too big to tackle at one time, I'll just summarize the major points of what I liked and didn't like.<br />What's good:<br />The storyline remains well-written and unpredictable.  As with the first book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" is full of surprises.  Characters never do what you expect them to do, plans have a tendency to not work out correctly, and Martin isn't afraid to kill off a major character when you least expect it.  He still manages to steer clear of most cliches and avoids the dull tone that plagues many fantasy novels.<br />The chapters told from the point of view of Jon Snow, which are all set north of the wall, are excellent.  Not only does Martin make you feel the desolation of the landscape and its effects on the Rangers, but his build up towards a climactic showdown is very frightening.  Overall, this is the best part of the novel.<br />Most of the characters are still likeable and well-developed.  Perhaps the best one in this volume is Catelyn Stark, who faces a lot of exasperating situations as she attempts to bring a close to the war.  Bran and Arya's chapters are also very well-written.<br />Like \\"A Game of Thrones\\", \\"A Clash of Kings\\" includes plenty of detailed descriptions, and they are generally historically accurate in terms of the story's correspondence with the history of England and other regions of the world.  Some people might find it tedious to read all the details about weapons and armor, ships, castles, and so forth, but I think that it helps draw readers in and makes the world more believable.<br />Lastly, Martin's ability to juggle all of his characters and plotlines at the same time is still pretty astonishing.  He obviously put a great deal of thought into how this book needed to be organized, and paid attention to details such as ensuring that the timing of events in different locations makes sense.<br />What's not good:<br />One of the best things about \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was that rather than using the stereotypical 'good vs. evil' storyline, Martin was careful to give everybody a human side and realistic motivations.  However, in \\"A Clash if kings\\", the pendulum swings back the other way.  There are big passages that exist only to remind us that the Lannisters are really, really, really evil.  Also, Tyrion, who was one of the best characters in the original, is neither as likeable nor as funny this time.  (Although he does have one hilarious line of dialogue near the start.)<br />It seems that Martin gave a little bit less thought to organization and pacing this time around.  The result is a novel that's almost two-hundred pages longer and doesn't seem to be arranged for maximum effect.  For example, there's a thirty page prologue that shows us Stannis Baratheon laying out his evil plans at Dragonstone, but I think that Ser Stannis would actually have been scarier if we didn't know exactly what he was planning.<br />Finally, Martin's attempts to expand the cast of characters and the number of forces at work in the story doesn't always add up logically.  For example, near the start we learn that House Greyjoy has been amassing a gigantic fleet in the Iron Islands and preparing to attack the mainland.  But he never explains why the possibility of the Greyjoy's joining the war never occurred to anybody else in the story.	2003-01-06
US	41549714	R1UPMBWV0C8BHY	034540288X	861735579	The Lost World	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A decent sequel, but nothing special	My father and my brother both insist that Michael Crichton is a hack who couldn't create a remotely interesting character if his life depended on it.  I think that he's capable of writing some damn good adventure stories.  As a matter of fact, we're all correct.  I readily admit that he has some major weaknesses, characterization being just one of them, but he also has a certain talent for building suspense and getting you caught up in the story.  \\"Jurassic Park\\" was one of the best science fiction adventure novels that I've ever read.  The sequel, \\"The Lost World\\", starts out with a promise of more fast-paced action, but it stumbles a little bit towards the end.<br />It's five years later, and the disaster on Isla Nubar has been thoroughly hushed up.  Ian Malcolm is still offering up mathematical theories, his latest being that studies of systems \\"at the edge of chaos\\" can provide the key to the extinction of the dinosaurs.  While Crichton's treatment of mathematics is, of course, nonsense, it's still amusing to read Malcolm's witty dialogue as he clashes with the skeptical mathematical community.  Meanwhile, reports are coming in of strange animal carcasses being found in Costa Rica, but the government is attempting to cover up the situation.  When a noted scientist suddenly vanishes without a trace, Malcolm joins with a engineer who designed special vehicles for him to rescue the man, and they take off for another island in the Pacific.  Needless to say, it turns out that the InGen engineers were breeding dinosaurs on this island as well, and the rescuers are soon being chased by an irate Tyrannosaurus.  Meanwhile, the notorious Lew Dodgson also ventures to the island in hopes of stealing dinosaur eggs.  For about the first two-hundred pages, Crichton does an excellent job of pulling you into the story.  The sense of adventure is tremendous.<br />Unfortunately, he just can't keep it up for the entire length of the book.  One problem is that the author apparently decided that he needed to a pair of children in danger once again.  The mechanism that he uses to bring two precocious kids to the island is pretty ridiculous.  Also, the final section is fairly predictable, with yet another case of equipment malfunctioning in critical situations, and Malcolm once again caring more about explicating his mathematical theories than surviving and escaping from the island.  I think that with a little bit more though and creativity, \\"The Lost World\\" could have been a better book, but it's still a decent way to waste a few hours of your spare time.decided that he needed to a pair of children in danger once again.

US	41549714	REI5F8YW4BZZV	0812567080	779129432	City of Bones	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Not bad at all	\\"City of Bones\\" easily ranks as an above-average fantasy novel.  Author Martha Wells does an excellent job of weaving together multiple plot lines.  The story is set is harsh fantasy landscape, where civilization has mostly collapsed.  There are only a few cities remaining, while the surrounding \\"waste\\" is inhabited by a variety of monsters and a type of mutant called \\"Krismen\\".  The main character is a Kris named Khat who is hired by a patrician from the city of Charisat to lead an expedition to a relic, a gigantic structure built for an unknown reason by the now-vanished Ancients.  However, this seemingly simple task soon turns deadly, and the characters are soon caught up in a dangerous race to find two more ancient objects that the Master Warder (the leader of a type of police force with magical powers in Charisat) is convinced will unlock the secrets of the ancients.  The plot line remains intriguing to the very end, and Wells is constantly springing new surprises on us.  While many fantasy novels tend to be entirely predictable, this one does an excellent job of not giving information away too soon, and I didn't have any luck at guessing what was about to happen.  The book's climax is a decent effort, although I've read better.<br />While the plot aspect of the book is strong, I felt that there were some missed opportunities.  The main male and female characters aren't particularly interesting, they're basically just copies of the stoic heroes that we've seen countless times before.  Some of the minor characters, particularly a mysterious former warder named Constans, are a little bit more intriguing, but the author doesn't really seem to care much about the characterization aspect of writing.  Another weakness is in setting.  While the city of Charisat and the surrounding arid wastelands are a welcome break from the quasi-Europe in the Middle Ages setting that we find in most genre fantasy, Wells doesn't really give us any feel for what life in the city is like.  It comes across as a rather bland place, in part because we meet only a very small subset of the population.  While these flaws don't ruin the novel, they make it less memorable than it could have been.	2002-12-02

In the first chapter, Jaryd binds to an eagle, thus fulfilling an ancient prophesy and indicating the mages of the Order will soon go to war.  He becomes the new leader of the Order and gathers the mages in the city of Amarid.  At first, nobody knows who their enemy will be in the upcoming conflict.  The League is still trying to destroy the Order, the Children of the Gods have bought new weapons from Lon-Ser, and a group of \\"free mages\\", who serve neither the Order nor the League, are attempting to stir up trouble throughout Tobyn-Ser.  Meanwhile, back in Bragor Nal, Melyor has to contend with assassins and a rival sovereign who wants to overthrow her.<br />It looks like Coe is setting up for a suspenseful finish to his series, but after the first two-hundred pages, the book breaks down.  Once the archvillain is revealed, the book loses most of its punch, in part because he turns out to be a weak and poorly-written character, with no apparent personality traits other than a general propensity towards evil.  The final four-hundred pages of the book are agonizingly slow (they contain only two action scenes) and developed with almost no skill, as if the author was simply trying to fill up as much space as possible.  There are many predictable scenes that should have been omitted.  For example, there's one occasion where the head bad guy has Jaryd, Alayna, and several other mages at his mercy, but he decides to leave them alive so that he can taunt them a little longer.  Needless to say, this eventually leads to his undoing.  How many earlier books and movies have included a scene exactly like this one?  Another big problem is the lack of continuity with the earlier books.  In \\"The Outlanders\\", for instance, Cailin had a vision where she was fighting against a new band of Outlanders, but this event never actually takes place.  This sort of mistake suggests that the ending of the series wasn't planned out very carefully.  In short, \\"Eagle-Sage\\" doesn't even live up to the fairly low standard  established by the first two books of the series; I would suggest skipping this one.	2002-11-16
US	41549714	R3DBD6HZEWLTRK	0812571134	852976109	The Outlanders (The Lon Tobyn Chronicle, Book 2)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Still just mediocre	In &quot;The Outlanders&quot;, David B. Coe does manage to avoid many of the mistakes that he made in &quot;Children of Amarid.&quot;  Most importantly, this book is a lot more fast-paced.  In contrast to the original, which had perhaps one plot event per every one-hundred pages, &quot;The Outlanders&quot; includes at least one significant event per chapter, and often more.  There are a lot of action and fighting scenes in this book, all of which are presented in an exciting and believable way.  As I mentioned in my review of &quot;Children of Amarid&quot;, I can't complain about Coe's writing skills.  He has an excellent ability to choose the right words at the right time when describing a scene and also a decent ear for dialogue, qualities which many of today's fantasy writers lack.<br />However, there are a number of things that bugged me throughout the book.  One that's difficult to ignore is that so many of the characters are so incredibly stupid.  The book is set four years after the ending of the previous volume.  The Children of Amarid are still unable to agree on anything because half of the order, for no apparent reason, doesn't believe that they should worry about another attack coming from Lon-Ser.  To break the deadlock, the Mage Orris decides to visit Lon-Ser himself, and he also helps the only surviving Outlander, Baram, escape from prison.  Jaryd and Baden help him cover up the prison break, but they don't have any plan for dealing with the situation when their enemies find out about it.  Orris takes Baram to Lon-Ser, but the prisoner simply runs away as soon as they reach their destination.  The point is that none of the characters seem capable of thinking logically or planning for the future.  This trend continues throughout the book.<br />Also, Coe stumbles into the pitfall of trying to tell the story from too many different perspectives.  The book could have been more compact if he'd focused on Orris and a couple of other main characters, ratherthan saturating the book with extra scenes featuring extraneous minor characters.  As it is, we'll often read a chapter about one person and then not seem them again until several hundred pages later, at which point we've almost forgotten about them.  While well-developed characters are, of course, good, Coe doesn't really give them any depth; he usually just spends page after page hammering home the same points about some particular person.  My final complaint is that much of the book seems dumbed-down and oversimplified.  For instance, there's one scene where the leaders of the three big cities (&quot;Nals&quot;) in Lon-Ser meet to discuss some important issues, and they just rush through the meeting without any real debate or scheming.  I felt that it was a remarkably bad representation of how politics in such a society would work.  &quot;The Outlanders&quot; isn't a total loss.  As I mentioned, the author controls the nuts-and-bolts issues of writing quite well.  I just hope that he'll put a little bit more thought into his next series.	2002-11-08
US	41549714	R17AB206A52THT	0441005098	77821646	Overshoot	Books	1	11	16	N	N	A Disaster	Let me start by saying that I don't judge novels by the message that the author is trying to deliver.  I judge them by how effective they are at getting that message across.  \\"Overshoot\\" has the right message, but the wrong delivery.  The book is ineffective and unsubtle in almost every possible way.  It's almost universally agreed that powerful novels don't feature long passages where the author simply drops the story and instead just starts directly telling the reader what their message is.  In \\"Overshoot\\" the narrator is constantly breaking into lecture mode, going on for paragraph after paragraph about how evil it is to disrespect the environment.  The resulting tone of preachiness is the book's defining characteristic, although there are any number of other annoying factors.<br />The book is set in Berkeley in the year 2032, when an ecological crisis and a series of international conflicts bring the world to the brink of disaster.  The main character is an 80-year-old named Moira, who narrates her life through a series of flashbacks.  Starting from when she was a child in the 1950's, she describes the events changing political movements that she witnessed during her lifetime.  Perhaps the strangest aspect of the book is that once she reaches the 1990's, she simply skips directly to the present 2032 without giving us any clue as to what sort of disasters happened to turn the world into the shambles that's displayed during the final chapters.  It's as if the author simply grew bored with the book around page 300 and decided to skip straight to the ending without caring whether or not it made sense.<br />While some of her descriptive writing is quite good, the author appears to have no understanding of how normal people talk during their everyday conversations.  Her characters use words like \\"provisions\\" instead of \\"food\\" and \\"compact disc player\\" instead of \\"CD player\\", and there's one scene where Moira encounters a drug dealer whose speech sounds more like an uptight English teacher than a street person.  Almost all of the dialogue in \\"Overshoot\\" sounds stilted and unrealistic.<br />Literally everywhere you look in this book there's something that annoys you.  At one point a character who's a Neopagan complains about the stereotypical representation of her religion in the media, yet members of her coven have names like \\"Red Wolf\\" and \\"Blue Otter\\".  If Mona Clee had actually spent some time (five minutes, maybe) researching the topic, she would probably have learned that Neopagans are not actually named after colored animals.  She throws in lots of pop culture references to things like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\", but she doesn't do it very well.  For instance, when she visits a cottage with a thatched roof, the Moira remarks that \\"there could have been hobbits living there\\".  Hello, doesn't the first sentence of \\"The Hobbit\\" clearly state that hobbits live underground.  (I know it's a minor complaint, but I'm a big Tolkien fan and stuff like that irritates me.)  One twenty-page chapter consisted solely of two characters using the internet for the first time while saying thing like \\"This internet has the power to bring people together\\" and \\"This internet will change the way we view the world\\", causing we to wonder whether I'd accidentally picked up an ad for a now-bankrupt ISP.<BR>In summary, learn from my mistake and don't bother with this train wreck of a book.	2002-11-02

As many others have mentioned, Vinge's unique vision of the future is one of the novel's biggest strengths.  He has created a galaxy where different species are moving upwards through a series of &quot;zones of thought&quot; as their technology becomes more sophisticated.  The catch is that once humanity has ventured into &quot;the beyond&quot;, it's difficult to go back to &quot;the slow zone&quot; because the new spaceships and computers won't work there.  Vinge's ingenious plot device is to have a spaceship carrying two children and some vital information crash-land on a planet that's right on the border of &quot;the slow zone&quot;, forcing a ragtag group of spacefarers to attempt a desperate rescue mission.  While almost all science fiction writers include intelligent aliens, the species that Vinge dreams up are quite different from anything I've ever seen in any other book.  There are the Tines, a race where a single consciousness controls a group of several individuals, the Skroderiders, a species that was sessile until they were provided with mechanical carts, and numerous others that help add color to the book.<br />But in addition to its remarkable futuristic world, &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; also contains an action-packed plot.  The author springs a major surprise on you in almost every chapter: characters that you though were good turn out to be traitors and vice versa, certain groups turn out to be more powerful than you thought, etc...  The bottom line is that you never know what's going to happen next, and Vinge manages to keep the suspense up throughout the entire book, despite its 613 page length.  &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; is very well paced, and Vinge never keeps you confused about a concept for very long before providing an explanation.  I personally felt that the endingdid a good job of wrapping up the plot while at the same time giving readers a few facets to wonder about.  Overall, this book deserved its Hugo Award, and a place on the shelf along with the best science fiction works of all times.	2002-10-27

Author T. H. White manages to mingle the humorous and the sad portions of the King Arthur story successfully, and he never talks down to his audience or tries to oversimplify the events.  The result is a wonderfully entertaining book that never slows down, one that's both amusing and serious.<br />I won't try to summarize the entire book.  Suffice to say, White covers the entire story of King Arthur's life and remains pretty faithful to the traditional version of events throughout the book.  What's really amazing, though, is the way that he captures the spirit of the times, making you feel like you're actually in England during the Middle Ages, watching the tournaments and quests and battles yourself.  His descriptions are beautiful without ever being unnecessarily lengthy, his characters seem to come alive (especially Arthur, Guenevere, and Lancelot), and his handling of some of the classic scenes is unforgettable.	2002-10-26

The most disappointing facet of this sequel is that it focuses less on my two favorite characters, while the political intrigues in the city of Sarantium take center stage.  While reading &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot;, I thought that Crispin and Kasia were two of the most mesmerizing characters that I had ever seen in a fantasy novel.  They both return in the sequel, but not very much attention gets paid to them.  We do see a lot of the minor characters from &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot;, including Scortius, Crescens, and Alixana.  They spend much of the novel playing musical beds, while the Emperor and his enemies scheme for power, but I never really made the same emotional connections with any characters that I did in the original.<br />I'm not saying that &quot;Lord of Emperors&quot; is a bad book.  It's quite entertaining with many worthwhile scenes, including another dramatic chariot race and a huge surprise that sets up a beautiful ending.  Kay's writing easily matches the high level that we've come to expect from him; his handling of dialogue, description, and emotion is exquisite.  However, I feel that he could have done a better job of controlling the plot and of keeping it focused on the central characters.	2002-10-23

However, it is still a well-written and tightly-plotted book, much better than most of the formulaic nonsense that passes for fantasy literature these days.  The author avoids spending large amounts of time explaining events from the original work, and he doesn't have the characters dwell excessively on things that happened earlier.<br />My biggest complaint about \\"The False House\\" is that it has almost exactly the same plot as \\"The High House\\".  The Society of Anarchists has once again stolen some magic object from Evenmere.  In this case, it's the cornerstone from underneath Innman Tor, and they plan to use it to build a new house in the outer darkness, an empty wasteland that lies beyond the borders of the high house.  Once again, Carter Anderson must go marching off to bring it back in order to protect Evenmere and all of creation from evil.  I would have hoped for a little bit of variation, but the sequence of events proceeds with remarkable predictability.<br />Other than that, there aren't any really glaring flaws in \\"The False House\\".  The cast of characters remains strong.  Stoddard brings back all the important people from \\"The High House\\" and also adds some colorful newcomers, although none of them have a background quite as original as Enoch and Chant.  As one other reviewer mentioned, there are a couple of female characters who are positively displayed in this volume, which corrects one minor annoyance from the previous work.  There are also a few of Stoddard's amazing visual descriptions of rooms and other locations, although not as many as there were in \\"The High House\\".  All in all, a solid and entertaining read, though slightly inferior to the original.	2002-10-08

Every page of it explodes with an amazing level of creativity, and the descriptions are so vivid and realistic that all of the settings seem to come alive.  The novel is suspenseful from beginning to end, the characters are well-drawn, and the story is written in a nice, succinct style that never gets bogged down.  In the end, I have to say that this book is a masterpiece, one that deserves to be placed next to the greatest high fantasy works of modern times.<br />The main character, Carter Anderson, is born and grows up in a mysterious Victorian mansion named 'Evenmere'.  One day, acting on advice from a sinister stranger, he steals his father's keys and opens a forbidden door in the attic of the house.  For reasons that aren't immediately clear, this action leads to Carter being sent away to boarding school for several years.  When he returns, he learns that his father has apparently vanished without a trace, and that he must find some way to protect the house from a group of anarchists hoping to invade it.  There's lots more that happens before the final showdown with the bad guys, but I won't ruin it for you.  I will say that Stoddard uses tons of imagination in creating the storyline.  How many other books do you know of where the author goes on a quest to his own basement to battle an evil couch?<br />I could spend pages praising Stoddard's skill at developing characters.  He never goes in for stereotypes, but instead insists on fully fleshing out every person in the book.  Carter Anderson is a wonderful protagonist and hero.  He has his strengths and flaws, but in the end comes across as a real human being who you might actually want to know and be friends with, rather than as some all-powerful superman.  The novel is populated by a fantastic array of minor characters, and some of the most thought-provoking passages involve exploring those people's backgrounds, although theynever get in the way of the main story.<br />Most of today's fantasy novels either ignore the topic of religion or else brush over it very lightly.  In contrast, \\"The High House\\" includes religious overtones, but rest assured that they aren't out of place.  With the exception of one hokey scene at the very end, the discussions of God and Creation fit well into the story.  It's not necessary that you be Christian or Jewish to enjoy this book, it's only necessary to have an open mind and the ability to appreciate great creativity.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of the novel is the sense of mystery.  Stoddard doesn't reveal all the information about Evenmere right at the start.  Instead, he offers up small amounts of information about the house's true nature one at a time, and even the ending doesn't entirely solve all of the riddles presented in the book.	2002-09-28
US	41549714	R1SKGJW8L4GRJB	0553575635	333696092	Ship of Magic (The Liveship Traders, Book 1)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wonderful and Enchanting	\\"Ship of Magic\\" is overflowing with creativity on almost every page.  The story centers around a city called Bingtown, which is known for producing liveships.  Once a liveship has been owned by a family for three generations, it 'quickens' and gains consciousness, at which point the ship's figurehead gains the ability to move and speak.  There are numerous other original elements in this novel.  For instance, there is one group near Bingtown known as the Rain Wild Traders who have the exclusive right to trade in special gems and other magical goods.  Only towards the end of the book do we learn what price they have to pay in order to deal with these items.  Let me be clear about one thing: the elements of magic are not just gimmicks designed to grab the reader's attention.  It's clear that the author, Robin Hobb, gave a great deal of thought to them when writing the book.  She carefully considered what effects the ownership of a liveship would have on a family of Bingtown traders, and integrated this element into her story very well.<br />In terms of plot, this isn't your standard 'good guys go on quest to defeat bad guys' fantasy novel.  Hobb follows several plotlines and several different groups of characters as they travel around the world, and, in the process gives us an overview of a society in the throes of rapid change.  The plot is full of surprises, such as a character who gets attacked by assassins right when he - and the reader - least expect it, and it is not at all predictable.  There were several occasions where I thought that I had figured out what would happen, only to see Hobb suddenly take off in an entirely new direction.  There is real suspense, not just corny melodrama, in numerous scenes throughout the book.  There are a number of mysterious elements mentioned, where we are supposed to wonder where a certain character comes from, or what events happened to drive somebody insane.  They aren't all neatly wrapped up at the ending, but that just builds our anticipation of the sequel.  There's a love story in here too, of course, but it's developed with the same skill as the rest of the novel, and actually includes some of the best romantic scenes that I've ever read in any genre.<br />\\"Ship of Magic\\"\\" is primarily a character-driven book.  Much of the eight-hundred page length is taken up by long stretches of character-driven dialogue and internal reflections, so if you're the sort of reader who wants to see a swordfight every five pages, this probably isn't the book for you.  If, on the other hand, you've been disappointed by the shallow characterizations in many modern fantasy novels, you'll probably find \\"Ship of Magic\\" to be a welcome change.  While the heroine, Althea, is a likeable character, she isn't perfect.  For instance, there's one point where she decides to go on a drinking binge at exactly the wrong moment, but she eventually redeems herself from her flaws.  All of the other members of the Vestrit family, who are the main focus of the book, are developed with great care, and their behavior is realistic throughout the novel.  As others have mentioned, the villains are one of the book's biggest strengths.  There's no comic-book type evil arch-nemesis here.  The bad guys have highly believable personalities, although that doesn't mean that you won't eventually come to loathe them wholeheartedly.  Hobb also takes a huge risk by writing some sections from the point-of-view of the intelligent ships, while others are seen through the eyes of a giant sea serpent who lurks in the water beneath the action.  These scenes provide a welcome and truly unique perspective on the events of the book.<br />I would be negligent if I failed to mention that Hobb's writing is fantastic.  It's clear that she put a great deal of attention into developing each paragraph, and it pays off.  The descriptions in the book are beautiful, and you actually understand how different cities, or different sections of coastline appear to the characters.  While anybody can write a scene set on a ship, only a talented author like Hobb can make us feel the conditions endured by sailors at sea, or experience the relief that they feel when returning home.  The writing remains strong throughout, and it helps make \\"Ship of Magic\\" one of the most unforgettable fantasy novels I've ever read.  Despite considering it for several days, I still can't think of anything negative to say about this book.	2002-09-12

That's ok, I understand that not every science fiction author strives to create literary masterpieces as well.  I can forgive the undeveloped characters and cliched dialogue (sample lines: &quot;Boy am I glad to see you.&quot;, &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;)  What I can't forgive is the fact that much of the novel doesn't really make sense.  Especially at the end, it was hard to keep track of what was going on, and the sudden revelations about who's actually working for the side of good, who's a double-agent, etc..., fail to really explain all of the characters' behavior earlier in the book.  Even so, &quot;The Jewels of Aptor&quot; does have enough fast-paced actions scenes to earn a three-star rating.	2002-09-03

It is a simple, straightforward description of the beginning of the Branch Davidian Cult, the rise of David Koresh as their leader, and the eventual showdown with the ATF.  Most importantly, Linedecker tells the story in an unbiased way, in contrast to the numerous versions that have been produced by conservatives and anti-government extremists.  Now it is true that the book was rushed into publication shortly after the siege, and consequently contains a small number of factual errors.  However, it is overall a well-researched and documented work.  For example, consider Linedecker's approach to the issue of Koresh's alleged abuse of children.  It is true that he includes the incident with the eight-month-old baby, a story that later proved to be questionable.  However, Koresh did regularly beat children and have sexual relations with underaged girls, and Linedeckers backs up these assertions with an impressive array of court documents and testimony from former cult members.  Since some of Koresh's defenders have attempted to downplay the reports about his abuse of children, it's obviously important to get the facts straight on this issue.  The author also documents the process by which the Branch Davidians obtained and constructed illegal firearms and their plans for a major terrorist attack against the city of Waco.<br />With that said, I can't pretend that the book is well written.  The writing is quite mediocre, with immature word choice, frequent grammar mistakes, and paragraphs that have just one sentence.  Linedecker sometimes goes off on tangents that don't really contribute to the story for several pages.  He provides long lists of people who were part of the cult, but doesn't really get into their heads to make us understand why they joined the cult.  Also, the eight-page photo section doesn't really serve any purpose.  Even so, I still recommend this book because I think that it's important for people to understand the truth about the tragic events that took place in Waco in 1993.	2002-08-31

Most of what others have said on this page is true.  The characters are well developed and believable, the romance is fairly touching, and the book seems to be well-researched, although I'm not an expert on the Middle Ages.  However, Kaufman's uneven writing is a huge distraction.  She'll write in straightforward, modern English for a few pages, then suddenly plunge into a mess of archaic phrasing and terminology.  I don't know why Kaufman thinks it's necessary to use words like &quot;caparisoned&quot; and &quot;vulperets&quot;, perhaps she thought that doing so would give the novel an air of authenticity.  Unluckily, I don't have time to study Middle English, and the result is that there are many scenes in &quot;Shield of Three Lions&quot; where I simply couldn't understand what was being described.  So in summary, it's not a bad read, but consider yourself warned about the language.	2002-08-29
US	41549714	R1Y9NKQJY8T58	0812575105	536013485	Darkness Descending (World at War, Book 2)	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Yawn	If you liked &quot;Into the Darkness&quot;, you'll like &quot;Darkness Descending&quot;.  If you didn't like &quot;Into the Darkness&quot;, you won't like &quot;Darkness Descending&quot;.  That's the bottom line.  I already wrote a lengthy review of &quot;Into the Darkness&quot;; to summarize: the battle scenes and military strategy are good, everything else is a waste of time, and the writing is lousy.  In &quot;Darkness Descending&quot;, Turtledove gives us more of the same ... a lot more.  We get the same cast of sixteen major characters, the same choppy style as the entire book is divided into four-page sections, and the same space wasted on reminding us that Kaunians wear pants while Algarvians wear kilts, Unkerlanters drink beer while Zuwazi drink wine, etc...<br />The problem, as I see it, is that the plot is now moving intolerably slowly.  In fact, only three things of significance happen during this entire book: the Kaunians are rounded up and slaughtered, the Algarvian attack on Cottbus fails, and Kuusammo joins the war.  All of this happens right at the start, and the rest of the book consists of nonsense like mushroom picking and shopping and characters saying &quot;Aye&quot; and &quot;Powers above!&quot; and &quot;Curse those Algarvians!&quot;.  To put it bluntly, it don't care about Sabrino's domestic woes or Talsu's dietary choices.  If Turtledove had decided to focus only on the war and to leave out the silly subplots, he could have written a much more enjoyable (and shorter) series.	2002-08-29
US	41549714	R1DQL10NJZN9OO	0553262505	826884658	A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	One of the greatest	Way back in the dark ages before the Harry Potter books were published, Ursula K Leguin's Earthsea trilogy was widely agreed to be one of the best fantasy series ever written.  Like many others from my generation, I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" at least ten times.  After recently picking up my old copy, I was pleased to find that the book stands up remarkably well from an adult perspective.  LeGuin's writing is, as always, top notch.  She uses a simple vocabulary and short, straightforward descriptions, and doesn't include very many big slabs of dialogue.  Consequently, the book remains short (183 pages) and moves quickly from one event to the next.  The ending is quite suspenseful.  Actually, the entire book is quite suspenseful, and the brief conflict scenes draw you in and make you feel like you're in the middle of the action.<br />The characters are another of the novel's biggest strengths.  The protagonist, Ged, is a young wizard in training.  During an attempt to show off his skills, he accidentally unleashes a shadow from the world of the dead and realizes that he must fix his mistake by tracking the shadow down and destroying it.  LeGuin doesn't take the sledgehammer approach to characterization; instead, she lets us see Ged's personality and changes through his behavior.  Unlike many other fantasy authors, LeGuin doesn't neglect her minor characters, and she develops the relationships between people with great care.<br />The plot of \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is very tight and well organized, with every major confrontation contributing to the overall meaning.  A less talented author could easily have taken twice as many pages and not said nearly as much.  The system of magic in LeGuin's world is more imaginative than in many other series, and she includes many episodes where Ged employs his  magic powers in clever ways.  Overall, LeGuin has the one thing that many fantasy authors lack: the ability to have fun.  She makes \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" enjoyably for bothchildren and adults.	2002-08-24

If you like lengthy discussions of pedophilia and descriptions of sexual torture, then you'll probably enjoy \\"Wizard's First Rule\\".  If, on the other hand, you believe that those topics are best excluded from fantasy writing, then you should probably avoid this book like the plague.  It would be no exaggeration to say that \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" is, by a considerable margin, the worst book I've ever read.  It trundles along without any hint of originality or inspiration, and the bizarre and unpleasant sexual content is added frequently in a failed attempt to break the monotony of the paint-by-numbers plot.  At the end, all you can do is gape in awe at the author's total incompetence and wonder how anyone with an IQ higher than 30 could possibly find as much as a single redeeming quality in this mess.<br />We start with an evil overlord, who bears the idiotic name of Darken Rahl.  (His father is named Panis Rahl.  I kid you not.)  Darken happens to need a magic object (in this case, it's a box) to fulfill his desire to take over the world.  Starting to sound familiar?  It gets worse.  We meet a noble but somewhat reluctant hero named Richard Cypher.  Richard is mentored by a wise, gray-haired wizard.  He also falls in love with a beautiful woman named Kahlan.  Unfortunately, an ancient form of magic prevents Kahlan from having sex with any man that she's in love with (D'oh!), but she does the next best thing, following Richard all over the place and offering up dialogue so corny that it would make George Lucas blush (\\"I can't go on anymore without telling you about me.  About what I am.  It's cleaving my heart, because I'm supposed to be your friend.\\")  The three heroes march off, fighting various monsters and bad guys along the way, and eventually have their final showdown with Darken Rahl (spoiler: the good guys win).  Amazingly, Goodkind takes this already thin storyline and stretches it to over eight-hundred pages, filling the space with tediously predictable events such as a scene where Richard must choose between saving his girlfriend or saving the world.  For those who haven't studied the art of comic-book plot development, I'll ruin the suspense by saying that the author dodges the dilemma by having him save them both.<br />The characters are unbelievably thin.  Darken Rahl has no personality or motivations whatsoever.  Will fantasy authors ever realize that undeveloped villains are neither frightening nor interesting?  Richard fares little better.  Whenever he's not fighting, he spends most of the time wallowing in self pity and wishing he were home, yet these emotions never seem to get in the way of his heroic quest.  The behavior and emotions of Kahlan and the Wizard Zedd are almost exactly the same, to the point where you wonder why Goodkind bothered to make three separate characters.  The cast of supporting characters is even worse.  For example, we have a spoiled, arrogant princess (hey, there's an original) who seems to exist only so that we can have the emotional satisfaction of seeing her get humiliated several times.<br />Whenever the plot slows down, which happens quite frequently, the author tries to keep us awake by providing some violent sexual content.  Women are raped, many children get abused and/or murdered, and I'm not even going to mention the man who is forced to eat his own testicles.  The high point, or perhaps I should say the low point, of this phenomenon comes towards the end, when Richard gets captured and tormented by a Mord-Sith, one of Darken Rahl's personal torturers.  Consider this passage: \\"There was a stunning explosion of pain in his head.  Denna's grip on his hair was all that kept him upright.  It was as if she had compressed the pain of an entire death training session into that one touch.  He couldn't move, breathe, or even cry out.  He was beyond being in pain; the shock took everything from him, and in its place left an all-consuming agony of fire and ice.\\"  Now try to imagine this nonsense going on for close to one-hundred pages, and you may start to see the problem.  It's interesting to compare the violent content in this book to that in \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  While George R. R. Martin also included scenes of rape and torture, he always kept them short and never went into unnecessary graphic detail.  Furthermore, his episodes always had a purpose, helping to build the characters involved or describe the societies that they live in.  In contrast, Goodkind's uses of rape, torture, and pedophilia are pure exploitation.  They contribute absolutely nothing to the novel as a whole, and could easily have been omitted without losing anything other than a sizeable chunk of the book's excessive bulk.<br />Believe me when I say that the problems listed above are only the tip of the iceberg.  There is literally nothing in this disaster of a novel that is done right.  Due to amazon's size constraints, I don't have time to describe the needlessly long and tedious descriptions, the unsubtle sexism and homophobia, the insults to vegetarians and the physically handicapped, the painfully bad fight sequences, the absurd plot contrivances, and the ending that's worthy of a third-rate Disney movie.  Suffice to say, \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" is a painfully awful exercise in overused stereotypes, without as much as a single redeeming quality.  A vengeful Mord-Sith couldn't make me pick up the sequel to this piece of excrement.  Nonsense like this is one of the reasons why many people simply choose to avoid fantasy fiction entirely.  Luckily, we have masters like Martin or Guy Gavriel Kay to defend the dignity of the genre, but they're going to have an uphill battle as long as talentless hacks like Goodkind continue to crank out garbage like \\"Wizard's First Rule\\".	2002-08-11
US	41549714	R2GLPT1UB77G82	034538055X	91263215	The Far Kingdoms	Books	2	14	21	N	N	Mostly just nonsense	\\"The Far Kingdoms\\" is one of the most pretentious fantasy novels that I've ever read, by which I mean that the authors apparently think that they've written something that's deep and meaningful and will have a big effect on the lives of their readers.  In reality, this novel is completely forgettable.  The plot deals with Amalric Antero, a spoiled rich kid who becomes a spoiled rich adult and joins with a soldier, Janos Greycloak, in several voyages.  They hope to find the legendary Far Kingdoms, a land of wealth and happiness that supposedly lies a long distance to the East.  Antero is one of the least likeable characters that I've ever seen in a fantasy novel.  His men die, and he has no emotional reaction at all.  His wife and child die, and he only mourns for a couple hours before taking off on another trip.  He seems to drift through the book without caring about what he's doing or what happens to other people.  In the end, I found that I didn't care whether or not Antero and Janos ever reached The Far Kingdoms.<br />In addition, it seems that not much thought was put into the plotting and writing of this novel.  The pace is very uneven.  Sometimes the authors dwell for pages on minute details, while other times they skip over months of action in just a few sentences.  The first fifty pages are totally irrelevant to the rest of the book; I think that they were written just to include some rather insipid sexual content.  After that, the plot falls into and endlessly repeating pattern.  The main characters travel somewhere, get into a desperate situation, get rescued miraculously, travel somewhere else, get into another desperate situation, get rescued again, etc...  Many of the scenes border on the absurd, such as an encounter with apparently intelligent tigers and monkeys in the middle of the desert, and by the time that a thirty-foot-long ghost ferret showed up to eat the bad guys, I was ready to throw this book into the garbage can.  In short, don't waste your time with this pile of nonsense.  If you want a short fantasy novel that's both creative and well-written, try \\"The High House\\", by James Stoddard.	2002-08-05

The strengths that Turtledove is famous for, namely warfare and battle scenes, are clearly evident.  However, we should expect better writing from an author of his caliber.<br />This concept behind this novel is to have a major war that takes place in a fantasy world, where technology is at a low level, so magic is used in place of high tech weapons.  This idea is intriguing, and Turtledove devotes a lot of attention to describing the available weapons and the ways that magic is used to control them.  After reading \\"Into the Darkness\\", you'll know how to feed and train a dragon and how to find a ley line from which to draw magical powers.  For those who enjoy that sort of this, Turtledove provides some fascinating explanations of battlefield tactics, and his actual scenes of warfare are almost always suspenseful.<br />Unfortunately, the novel falters whenever it moves away from the war that constitutes its central plot device.  Part of the problem is that Turtledove decides to tell the story from no fewer than sixteen points of view.  To accomplish this, he divides the book into sections of about five pages, and skips abruptly from one POV to the next.  Since each character in the novel receives a grand total of about thirty pages, it's difficult to care about any of them.  If half as much time was devoted to characterization as to the endlessly repetitive descriptions of food and clothing, this could have been a much more memorable work.  To make matters worse, the authors employs every imaginable stereotype, including the evil king, the spoiled rich girl, the corrupt policeman, the absent-minded professor, etc...  All of the soldiers in  the story (there are at least ten of them) have exactly the same personality, making it nearly impossible to tell them apart, andTurtledove does a remarkably poor job of showing the suffering undergone by servicemen in wartime.<br />Then there's the quality of the writing itself; it has every mark of a novel that was rushed into publication without enough rewriting or editing.  Turtledove makes tons of minor mistakes, such as writing \\"east\\" when he means to say \\"west\\", and there are ridiculous sentences such as, \\"Those boys can hide a six-course supper hiding under dead leaves.\\"  There are endless cliches (\\"He did not know how his wife was.  Not knowing ate at him; it left an empty place where his heart should have been.\\") and annoying attempts to sound authentically old fashioned, such as placing the word \\"Aye\\" before every line of dialogue.  The conversations rarely last more than a page, as if the author can't wait to wrap up this scene and move to the next one.  The dialogue itself is often poorly written, since the characters never seem to do anything much besides talk about war and politics.  Finally, there's no attempt to break from the novel's dreary tone with any humor, unless you count the hilariously inept attempts at sexual innuendo, of which there are far too many.  Lines such as, \\"And after supper, would you like to get you own eel stewed?  I have a room upstairs.\\" are thrown in on almost every page, apparently for the exclusive purpose of appealing to horny adolescent boys.<br />In the end, I only awarded this book three stars by a very narrow margin.  Turtledove didn't put enough time and effort into it to make it truly worth reading, unless you're bored and have nothing better to do.  If you'd like to read a much better blending of high fantasy and war story, I recommend George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Fire and Ice.\\"	2002-08-04

Towards the end, this novel becomes a real page-turner.  I sped through the final hundred pages in one sitting.  Even though the actual plot events are somewhat predictable, each scene is developed with such care that I couldn't stop reading.<br />The planet of Irustan is a rigidly religious society where women hold no political power and are frequently abused or even killed by their husbands.  Of course, we know that there are places on Earth right now where such conditions aren't fictional, but Marley brings the situation to life by taking us inside the head of the female main character.  Zahra, a medical professional (medicant) in the main city on Irustan, must treat injured women on a daily basis.  The author does a wonderful job of showing her frustration and her determination to fight back against society.  Unfortunately, most of the minor characters are largely ignored, but the overall effect of the story is still powerful.  I won't explain what Zahra does, but I will say that Marley's analysis of her emotional state throughout the book makes her one of the most memorable characters that I've ever encountered in a science fiction novel.  And although there are a few loose threads that don't get tied up at the end, the conclusion is still a powerful scene in its own right.  Pick up a copy of \\"The Terrorists of Irustan\\"; you won't regret it.	2002-08-02

Crispin, a mosaicist, receives an offer to work on a sanctuary in the Imperial capitol of Sarantium.  Initially, he doesn't want to go, but a sequence of events outside his control forces him to make the journey.  Crispin is a wonderfully complex and believable character.  He's haunted by memories of his lost family, and decides to immerse himself in his art in an attempt to escape from the world, although that proves to be difficult.  There are no stock characters or stereotypes in this novel; even the minor characters are carefully drawn.  Kay often spends five or ten pages explaining the background of a secondary character before returning to the main plotline.  While some people might find this annoying, I thought that it helped draw me into the world that the author had created.<br />Plotwise, this is not your typical 'swords and sorcery' epic.  Instead, Kay uses the story of Crispin and the events that he gets drawn into to show how his fantasy world was shaped by a variety of forces.  The setting of \\"Sailing to Sarantium\\" is a fantasy world with parallels to the early Byzantine Empire.  Although there are battle scenes and fights, they tend to be short.  Instead, Kay focuses a lot on the interactions between characters, and on how the religious and political conflicts within the Empire affect them.  Some of the best scenes, such as a dramatic chariot race in Sarantium, are written mainly to show the reader what life was like during this historical period, although they are always blended into the main plotline.  There are moments of quiet introspection, where Crispin and others have a chance to relax and reflect on what's happening to them.  The ending, in my opinion, was the best part of the book, since it provides a touching and meaningful finish while also paving the way for the sequel.  Overall, I highly recommend this novel for its originality and excellent writing.	2002-08-01
US	41549714	R3H4QH2WAI9J4F	0441478123	101055477	The Left Hand of Darkness	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A masterpiece that everyone will enjoy	Some science fiction works are optional.  \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" is not.  It is one of the most important novels in the development of modern SF, and it also includes some of the best writing in the history of the genre.<br />The story is set entirely on a planet called Gethen, where people have no specific gender.  This detail is not included just as a gimmick.  Le Guin looks in depth at the implications of such an idea.  The society that she imagines is one that has no warfare and no well-defined concepts of a family.  She includes lots of interesting and sometimes humorous snapshots of what a genderless culture means, such as a character whose behavior appears 'female', but who has actually been the father of four children.  By describing this alien society, Le Guin makes some hard-hitting points about the way that gender and sex have shaped our world.  And by tackling issues that most earlier science fiction authors had ignored, she helped open the door to a new generation of literary SF works.<br />In case the above paragraph makes \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" seem boring or preachy, let me just emphasize that it also has a suspenseful, fast-moving plot.  An ambassador from another planet is trying to convince the leaders of Gethen to join an organization that allows for trade and communication between worlds.  Despite his good intentions, he ends up caught in a web of political deception; some people would prefer that Gethen remain isolated.  Throughout the book, the characters' reactions to the events around them is entirely believable, helping to create a vivid portrait of a society as it faces a tremendous change.  The last hundred pages take a radically different turn from the earlier parts of the book.  I won't spoil it for you, but I will say that Le Guin decides to focus the reader's attention on the two main characters and the way that the differences between their bodies and minds affects their relationship.<br />Let me add one more important fact: the writing in this book is outstanding.  It's clear that Le Guin put a great deal of effort into developing each chapter.  The dialogue is well-written and meaningful, and the descriptions of setting on the planet of Gethen are unforgettable.  The author can find the beauty in everything, even in a hostile landscape of rock and ice.  Touches like that make \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" one of my favorite novels of all time.	2002-07-29

The strengths that Turtledove is famous for, namely warfare and battle scenes, are clearly evident.  However, we should expect better writing from an author of his caliber.<br />....<br />In the end, I only awarded this book three stars by a very narrow margin.  Turtledove didn't put enough time and effort into it to make it truly worth reading, unless you're bored and have nothing better to do.  If you'd like to read a much better blending of high fantasy and war story, I recommend George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Fire and Ice.\\"	2002-07-21
US	41549714	RSMI5NPHK67HG	0812516338	550073564	A Million Open Doors	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A Million Open Doors	John Barnes shows some promise in A Million Open Doors, enough that I would recommend it to a friend.  Hes assembled a moderately original idea and some likeable characters into an enjoyable book, but there are some big flaws that drag it down, especially towards the end.<br />The main character, named Giraut, leaves his home and moves to a culture known as the Caledons.  Caledon society is a distopia based on the idea of rationality.  If a group of computers known as aintillects decides that a person is engaged in irrational behavior, such as doing favors for a friend or appreciating the wrong works of art, then they can be dragged off to a mental institution by the government.  Upset by this stifling censorship, Giraut decides to open a school and teach dancing and music to some of the Caledon children.<br />While this concept may sound interesting, Barnes writing is all over the place.  He cant seem to decide whether he wants to be writing a true hard science fiction novel or a parody.  Are we really supposed to believe that Giraut could break through generations of conformity and start a revolution just by teaching some kids to play the guitar?  Fortunately, he hurries the plot along without giving us too much time to worry about such questions.  Also, Barnes is quite skillful at developing his characters.  Unlike so many of todays SF writers, he gives them real motivations and allows us to see how their behavior and their thoughts change as they get exposed to new ideas.<br />However, I would be negligent if I didnt mention some important weaknesses.  Barnes choice of language is pretty bland, and his descriptions dont give you any real sense of what hes trying to illustrate.  Also, he needs a decent editor to crack down on sentences such as Thorwald started, I could see that his career as a blasphemer would be developing slowly; he seemed to be reacting as if what he had said a minute ago was hanging around in the air like old flatulence.  He view of gender roles is still stuck in the 50s; somebody should politely inform him that women are capable of doing more than just having sex and doing secretarial work.  And theres this annoying habit of substituting like-sounding futuristic words in place of common English ones.  He writes merce instead of mercy, nop instead of nope, etc  Finally, the conclusion is too rushed, as if he was working under a deadline and had to cram too much plot into too little space.<br />Still, if you can look past these problems,, you can find some decent science fiction in A Million Open Doors.  While it doesnt rank up there with the masters like Heinlein or Clarke, its still a decent read.	2002-07-16
US	41549714	RQF91EXP71JW6	0812576403	85474640	The Light of Other Days	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Outstanding	\\"The Light of Other Days\\" is a masterpiece.  It begins with a startling idea, covers a lot of ground, and finishes with an outstanding ending.  Despite the fact that it contains a lot of scientific background, it remains easily readable.  I give this novel five stars despite its unnecessary soap opera subplot.<br />The story centers around the invention of the \\"wormcam\\", a device that allows the user to see and hear what is taking place at any location in the world.  Although a domineering industrialist attempts to keep this invention to himself, it first shows up in the hands of the government and is then leaked to the general public.  Since anybody can now spy on anyone else's activities, this leads to the total elimination of human privacy.  Clarke and Baxter show us how this advance totally revolutionizes society.  So much of our current culture is built on lies; politicians lie to the people, businesses lie to their own customers, and we lie to our own friends and families.  If everyone was able to learn, and thus forced to confront, the truth, our lives would be changed completely.<br />More developments occurs when a new wormcam is invented that allows people to see into the past.  I won't give away what happens next, but I can assure you that this portion of the novel is one of the most fascinating passages that I've ever read.   As several of the reviews below can attest, the authors aren't afraid to stake out unpopular positions on controversial topics, or to challenge some of today's most widely held conceptions (and misconceptions).  I heartily recommend this work, even to people who haven't read much science fiction.	2002-07-12

If you saw the cover, you might think that it was a humorous and lighthearted look at the phenomenon of left-handedness.  However, the vast majority of this book is not even slightly amusing.  Unfortunately, Jack Fincher isn't very good at explaining complicated concepts in layman's terms, and he doesn't really try to make &quot;Lefties&quot; very entertaining.  The body of the book is dedicated to a scientific explanation of what causes some people to be left-handed, and it strays into such fields as particle physics, molecular biology, and neuroscience.  I suppose that some people might like that sort of thing, but to me it was about as enjoyable as a high school chemistry textbook.	2002-07-10
US	41549714	R2W1ZYPJTP6TM7	0553286285	948568483	Nemesis	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Average	I give \\"Nemesis\\" three stars for originality and suspense, but none for the writing or the characters.  It is an easily readable book with a decent ending, but it's not nearly as good as some of Asimov's earlier works.<br />\\"Nemesis\\" is set several hundred years in the future, when small numbers of humans have moved away from the planet Earth, which is in decay, and started to live on settlements in space.  Janis Pitt, the leader of one of these settlements, decides to move it to a hidden star system nearby, where he hopes to establish a Utopia and prevent any outsiders from entering.  The settlement, known as Rotor, is set in orbit around a planet called Erythro.  However, a plague apparently caused by sinister forces on Erythro complicates the settlers' plans.  Meanwhile, back on Earth, scientists are struggling to discover the secret to faster-than-light travel so that they can find Rotor.  The story starts off pretty slowly, but it becomes pretty suspenseful once the main character, a girl named Marlene, starts being pulled by mysterious forces on the planet of Erythro.<br />For some reason, Asimov always chooses to write about ninety-five percent of each novel in dialogue format.  In \\"Nemesis\\", this style becomes annoying because all of the characters sound almost exactly the same.  There's no attempt to give any of them a unique and original voice.  Also, despite the fact that most of the characters are supposed to be brilliant scientists, they're all fairly stupid.  They prattle on for pages before suddenly realizing facts that have been obvious to the reader for several chapters.  The worst character of all is the archvillian, who's supposed to be a big evil dictator but instead comes across as more of an annoying loser.<br />Anyway, \\"Nemesis\\" is a decent quick read, but it doesn't have the same imagination and character development as Asimov's better works.  I recommend \\"Foundation\\" and \\"Foundation and Empire\\", \\"Nightfall\\", and \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" instead.	2002-07-09

Clarke seems to have a good grasp of the elements of writing, and he's eliminated some of the flaws that appeared in his earlier works.  Like most of his novels, this one presents a lot of ideas in a small space and leaves some major questions unresolved at the conclusion.  It's a book that will leave you thinking for days afterward.<br />The story, which is told partially in explanatory flashbacks, begins when scientists discover that the sun will explode within a few thousand years, leading to the destruction of Earth.  In order to save humanity, several small colonies are established on nearby planets.  Later, after the discovery of a new technology, large spaceships are able to carry millions of colonists out to the stars.  Most of the plot concerns what happens when one of these ships arrives on a planet that was already colonized earlier.  The original concept that drives this book is that the first round of colonies was very carefully engineered by people from Earth.  They were designed to be paradises where people would be raised in an environment quite different from Earth.  Thus, there is a definite culture clash when the big spaceship arrives.<br />I found that Clarke handled the characterization of the two different groups of people quite well.  It was really possible to understand how their backgrounds were totally different and how this gave rise to two different worldviews.  Also, Clarke cut down on unnecessarily thorough descriptions, so &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot; is more compact and readable than some of his earlier efforts.  Finally, as others have mentioned, his language and dialogue is very lyrical and poetic, which helps the reader understand the mood of the characters in this distant paradise.	2002-07-08

There's one thing that I can say for certain: it's totally different from any other science fiction novel that I've read recently.  If I tried to describe the premise of this book, it would sound absurd.  However, Ringworld is not an attempt at comedy.  At the same time, it isn't really a typical work of hard science fiction.  It's set in the far future, and takes place mostly among civilizations run by aliens who possess amazing technology.  However, there's not much attempt to explain how the technology works.  For instance, we learn that the aliens can move entire planets, but we never find out how they do it.<br />The story concerns a team of two humans and two aliens who crash-land on a gigantic ring in a distant star system.  The ring is millions of times larger than the Earth, and was clearly built by some very advanced society.  Most of the novel concerns their exploration of the ring itself.  However, very little time is spent on action or fighting scenes.  Instead, there is a great deal of description.  The creativity that Niven uses in creating the Ringworld is probably the novel's biggest strength.<br />Another concept that makes this work an original is the explanation of the relationships between humans and different alien species.  This isn't a stereotypical us vs them adventure story, but it isn't a feel good, everybody works together scenario like Star Trek either.  As I said, the ideas would sound silly if I listed them here, but Niven takes them seriously and works them into the story quite well.<br />Ringworld is an easy read, and at 350 pages, it's shorter and flows better than many SF novels.  Other have complained that the character development is poor, but characters aren't supposed to be the main focus of Ringworld.  Finally, let me just add that you don't need to have read any of Niven's previous works to enjoy this one.  I'd never even heard of him until I picked this book up.	2002-06-28
US	41549714	R1IW3OPOKNPZTV	0812511816	456114433	The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)	Books	3	9	16	N	N	Doesn't live up to it's reputation	&quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is probably the most famous fantasy novel written in the last generation, but it doesn't deserve to be.  About the only thing that's going for this novel is the terrific ending, with a huge surprise waiting in the final line.  But to get there, you have to wade through about 650 pages of tripe, and that's in the hardcover edition.<br />For most of the book, the plot is fairly straightforward.  There's a group of eight people who need to get from point A to point B, where point A is called The Two Rivers and point B is called Tar Valon.  Meanwhile, an archvillian known as The Dark One sends overwhelming sinister forces to stop them.  This portion of the book isn't developed with much skill, which is what makes it pretty boring.  All that the good guys have to do is swing their swords around a few times and they can easily defeat entire armies of bad guys.  One top of that, the good guys are led by an Aes Sedai (a female wizard) who can do more or less anything, so there's never any real sense of danger.  The action scenes also grow very repetitive.  For instance, there's one scene where our heroes are being chased by a horde of villians, but luckily they're able to run into a magic place where the bad guys just aren't willing to go.  This exact same scene gets repeated twice later in the novel.<br />Many people seem to think that the characterizations are one of this novel's strengths, but I don't agree.  The main character is named Rand al'Thor, and the novel is supposed to show him changing from an ordinary farmboy into a great warrior.  The problem is that he doesn't act like an ordinary person at the start; none of the five characters who grew up in a small down do.  They all acts like soldiers right from the start.  They're willing to plunge into battle without any hesitation, and the children always act totally grown up.  I found the characters to be largely static and unbelievable.<br />This certainly isn't a terrible novel.  As I mentioned, it does have a wonderful surprise ending.  Just don't expect to be swept away by it.  Also, be sure to read the gloassary at the end, which is more entertaining than most of the book.	2002-06-20

Random Threats from an Unarmed American	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Conservatives really need to get a sense of humor	Regardless of whether you're liberal, conservative, centrist, or nonpolitical, you must agree that this book is hilarious.  How can you not laugh when Pat Buchanan, America's self-proclaimed moral crusader, accepts a campaign check from the John Wayne Gacy Fan Club?  Or when Moore suggests that we forget about Senators and simply vote for our favorite lobbyists?<br />Moore guides us through the landscape of the American political and economic system, with one chapter devoted to each major issue.  Although he maintains the humorous tone throughout the book, he also presents plenty of solid information of the sort that you won't hear about in the \\"mainstream\\" media.  For instance, in one chapter he lists the gigantic government handouts that have been given to America's multi-billionaire \\"corporate welfare mothers\\".  Moore is at his best when skewering the hypocrisy of conservative corporatists (i.e. those who brag about their patriotism while sending our jobs to Mexico.)	2002-06-13

Some of the reviewers here have complained that the characters and plot aren't original.  While they may have a point, what matters is that Martin actually draws the reader into the story, and makes you feel the anger, fear, and triumph of the people involved.  I have two favorite characters.  The first in Arya, a tough-minded young princess who's more interested in swordfighting than in the maidenly arts, which leads to conflict with here uptight sister.  The second is Tyrion, a dwarf whose quick and agile mind make up for his physical handicaps.  Although he is one of the villanous Lannisters, you can't help but like him by the end of the story.<br />The story involves two great houses, the Starks and the Lannisters, who compete for influence and control.  There are also several intriguing subplots dealing with other forces that threaten to intrude upon the Seven Kingdoms where the main action takes place.  There are several big surprises in the book that catch you off guard.  I should warn you that several of the plotlines are not wrapped up neatly at the conclusion, so you might want to have the sequel, \\"A Clash of Kings\\", available as soon as you finish.<br />My one complaint with this book is that the beginning is too long and features too much exposition, while parts of the ending seem rushed.  In particular, I really felt shortchanged by two battle scenes at the conclusion.  If less time had been spent on some rather plodding dialogue at the start, the novel might flow a little bit better.	2002-06-10

Coe, is that this guy can actually write.  He has talent for describing beautiful landscapes and writing exciting action scenes that actually make sense.  Throughout the book, you feel that the environment is real, and you understand the effects that is has on the moods and actions of the characters.  One problem that plagues a lot of current fantasy is that the authors feel that they need to imitate language from earlier eras, so they throw in a lot of distracting, archaic words and phrases.  Coe writes in a modern, straightforward manner.  He also gives his characters names that are original, but still easy to pronounce.<br />The problem with this book is its unoriginal plot and characters.  It deals with a band of powerful mages, known as the Children of Amarid, whose are supposed to use their power to protect the people of Tobyn-Ser.  Unfortunately, one of the strongest mages decides to betray the order and use his abilities to take over the land.  (Don't you just hate it when that happens?)  Luckily, we have a young hero named Jaryd who sets out on a quest to protect Tobyn-Ser.  He's accompanied by a wise old mentor, needless to say.  And there's a young female mage whose job is to fall in love with the hero.  And there are many other boring characters and predictable plot events, but nothing that doesn't give you the feeling that you've read it or seen it many times before.  The only original touch in this novel is that each mage is required to form a mental link with a hakw or owl, which then helps them in battle.  Unfortunately, the birds are barely mentioned during the second half of the novel, so Coe doesn't really explore the possibilities presented by this concept.<br />I'm not saying that \\"Children of Amarid\\" is a bad novel.  It's an easy and entertaining read, and you shouldn't be intimidated by the 600-page length.  It's a perfectly good way to waste a couple of lazy summer afternoons.  It just isn't a memorable work of fantasy.	2002-05-11
US	41549714	R8JKZ3G3NP1Y8	0553290991	166385709	Nightfall	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Among the Best SF novels ever written	Nightfall, by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg, is set on a planet that has six suns and perpetual daylight.  The plot revolves around an unlikely event: an eclipse that shrouds the world in darkness for several hours.  The main characters in the story are all scientists, and they are able to predict the arrival of the eclipse, but not its results.  Because people on this world have lived with sunlight for their entire lives, the darkness inflicts severe psychological trauma on the population.  The book is divided into thirds, with the first section showing the discovery of the eclipse, the second section is set on the night of the eclipse, and the third shows what happens afterwards.<br />This is a fairly short novel, just over 300 pages, and the authors' writing is quite good.  I think that Asimov does a better job with the characters and dialogue in Nightfall than he did in most of his other novels.  Also, there isn't much time wasted on long descriptions or on lecturing about the novel's themes, so the novel keeps moving at a good pace.  I would have liked it if a little less time was dedicated to the character's personal lives, especially since some of their actions during and after the eclipse seem a little bit absurd.  Overall, the book's strongest component is the originality of the concept.  The idea of a world where darkness is a catastrophe is so different from the repetitive and predictable plots of so many other SF novels that I found Nightfall hard to put down, even when reading it for the second time.<br />Some people have complained that the authors' attitude towards religion is insulting, but I disagree.  I don't think that they intended to bash all religions.  They were, rather criticizing fanatiscism and cult-like behavior.  And while some people might not agree with Asimov's rigid insistance on following science and logic at all costs, that shouldn't prevent anyone from enjoying the book as a good work of science fiction.	2002-05-04
US	41549714	R22NEG2EH4QJ15	0553288202	47311872	The Fall of Hyperion	Books	4	0	1	N	N	The Fall of Hyperion	In the field of science fiction, sequels usually don't live up to the original, especially not when the original is as good as Hyperion.  The Fall of Hyperion is a bit of a let-down because author Dan Simmons turns away from the main strengths of the first novel and tries to move to a new setting, new characters, and a new style.  Although this sequel does show the fate of the pilgrims from Hyperion and explain the nature of the Time Tombs, the majority of the action is set on TC2 and other planets and deals with politics and warfare in the Hegemony.  The pilgrims are only mentioned during brief dream sequences.  Perhaps the biggest dissapointment is that Simmons doesn't create any more wonderfully imaginative planets or any other new setting for this novel.  He just employs the same settings as the previous one.  However, The Fall of Hyperion does have a very well-orchestrated plot that explains all the loose ends that were left open from the original.	2002-04-20

In terms of character, setting, plot, and style, &quot;Hyperion&quot; outdoes almost every other SF novel ever written.  It captures the same sense of wonder that was first found by great authors like Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein.<br />The story concerns seven pilgrims who are on a voyage to visit a mysterious creature called the Shrike on the planet of Hyperion.  They decide to each tell the story of their lives and explain why they chose to take this voyage.  The seven characters are the story's main strength, as Simmons gives each one a unique tone and realistic motivations, thus preventing the book from getting boring.  The other amazing part of this novel is the imagination that goes into describing the alien worlds that humanity inhabits in this far future universe.  I won't spoil it by giving away anything else.  In summary, buy this novel and read it!  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and start reading &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;.	2002-04-09
US	41549714	R3SWT98V7Q4O41	0446608173	702775208	A Cavern of Black Ice (Sword of Shadows, Book 1)	Books	1	25	48	N	N	Terrible, and very disturbing at times	As a reader, I usually try to finish what I start, and I've worked my way through several lengthy books that I didn't find to be enjoyable.  However, I could not bring myself to finish A Cavern of Black Ice.  After five hundred pages of dreary descriptions, annoying characters, and almost no plot events, I finally put away my copy without bothering to reach the ending.<br />The most unpleasant feature of this novel is the numerous scenes of torture and physical injury.  The descriptions of torture and executions are unnecessarily graphic (for parents, I would recommend that children under 15 not be allowed to read this book at all).  Now I am not completely opposed to the inclusion of such scenes in any book, but these incidents are entirely gratuitous.  They could have been left out without damaging the plot line, and the result would be a much more enjoyable novel.<br />Another annoying facet of this book is the descriptions and characterizations of the different genders.  Without exception, the males are large, tough, and muscular while the females are small, thin, and weak.  The cover art may lead you to believe that the lead female character is some sort of warrior, but that just isn't the case.  I've never understood why sexism like this is so rampant in fantasy writing.  Would it really be that difficult to include a strong and powerful female character?  There is also a rape scene which is, again, totally superfluous.<br />With that said, I'll now try to critique the novel while ignoring those two objections.  Overall, I found the writing to be extremely poor.  I know that some authors like to be more wordy and descriptive than others, but Jones surely goes to excess in this case.  Everything - people, locations, objects, people's thoughts, and plot events - gets described in excruciating detail.  A character can't smile, frown, speak, stay silent, walk, or stand still without a full paragraph to describe their actions.  The metaphors that are used are oftenquite silly.  For instance, strawberries are described as smelling like prostitutes, half of the locations smell like urine, and the physical characteristics of most male characters is often compared to meat.  These may seem like minor complaints, but once you've read about men being described in terms of sirloin steak ten times, it starts to grow distracting.  The end result of all this description is that the novel is very long (950 pages) and slow moving.  There is literally one entire chapter devoted to showing a man walking down a staircase.<br />One other flaw in this novel is that it stays focused on unpleasant and nasty scenes.  It is an endless stream of torture, fighting, sickness, and starvation.  There are almost no pleasant and enjoyable scenes, and the author never even tries to give us a break by adding some humor or poking fun at the conventions of the fantasy genre.  I much prefer authors like T. H. White and Piers Anthony who don't take themselves too seriously.<br />So what is A Cavern of Black Ice about?  It's set in a frozen wasteland where characters with names like \\"Mace Blackhail\\" and \\"Vaylo Bludd\\" spend most of their lives try to hack members of rival clans to pieces.  One clan member named \\"Raif Sevrance\\" gets kicked out of his home (this takes about 300 pages to happen) and shows up at just the right place to rescue Ash, a young teenager who's running away from her evil foster father, while further subplots follow almost every character, no matter how minor.	2002-04-04
US	41549714	RTK7WYNNV43QO	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Reasonably entertaining and original	Since its publication, Dune has recieved an impressive reputation in the SF community.  If you expect this work to be the greatest novel ever, you'll probably just be dissappointed.  On the other hand, if you just expect it to be above-average science fiction, you'll get what you're looking far.<br />Dune is set in the far distant future, when a single emperor rules all of humanity and various Houses govern individual planets.  The main character is Paul of the House Atreides, which has recently been sent to govern the planet known as Dune.  Dune is important for political and economic reasons because it produces a special spice that is necessary for interstellar travel.  As others have already stated, Dune is one of the most remarkable and original worlds ever created by an SF author, featuring a parched and hostile landscape populated only by rugged &quot;Freemen&quot; and gigantic sandworms.  However, I should also warn that Herbert's explanation about the relationship between the spice, the sandworms, and Dune's climate is a bit cryptic (as a matter of fact, a lot of this book is tough to comprehend), and you may need to reread some passages many times before you understand what is being said.<br />The plotline of the novel is very intricate and suspenseful, and you will want to keep reading to find the outcome of the battle between Paul, the Freemen, and a rival house.  However, Herbert cannot right a decent battle scene, and the numerous fight sequences lack any suspense.  Also, the strange dreams and premonitions that Paul experiences throughtout the book are poorly written and overdone; most of them should have been left out.  Still, Dune is overall an engrossing read, and you won't regret buying it.	2002-04-02

Wells' vision of the future was unique for its day and still is, for the most part.  He first encounters a race called the Eloi, who live a perfect life filled with abundance, never wanting food or anything else.  Then...well, I won't spoil the surprise.  I will, however, warn you that Wells does not go in for thorough descriptions or explanations.  The ending of the book leaves many unanswered questions that might be frustrating to some readers.	2002-03-28

Set in the magic land of Xanth, it tells the story of a man named Bink who must determine what his magic power is before he turns twenty-five, or else he will be exiled forever.  The great magician Humphrey is certain that Bink has great powers, but believes that somebody is trying to hide them.  There are plenty of surprises and scenes of great suspense throughout the novel.  Some people might view the ending as a rip-off, but really this isn't a novel that's read for its plot.<br />What makes this book so good is that Anthony doesn't take himself too seriously.  It's filled with outrageous puns and jokes, and the author never stays in a serious mood for very long before reverting to a humorour scene.  That's the real reason that \\"A Spell for Chameleon\\" and the ensuing sequels are still so amazingly popular.	2002-03-24

Within a few years, the alien &quot;Overlords&quot; have eliminated all war, poverty, and disease, and turned the Earth into a real-life paradise.  The main strength in this (and every other) Arthur C Clarke novel is the writing.  If you buy into the idea of the novel, then you'll find that it moves at a good pace and provides decent suspense.  There's no denying that Clarke was a skilled writer, and that he produced good dialogue and excellent visual descriptions.<br />The body of the book is spent describing life on Earth after the arrival of the Overlord's.  There are a lot of interesting concepts that are brought up but not developed in full.  For example, Clarke mentions that the visit from the aliens leads to the elimination of all religions on Earth.  I don't think that demolishing religion would be quite that easy, and I think that the argument could be looked into at great length in some other book.  Unfortunately, Clarke only spends a couple paragraphs on that subject before he abruptly jumps to the next one.  Similarly, Clarke doesn't explain the new economic system of the planet very thoroughly.  He merely states that poverty has been eliminated and that no one needs to work menial jobs any more (presumably, they've been replaced by machines).  But how would this affect people?  Wouldn't most of them choose to sit around being lazy most of the time?  Although there's some description of science and artwork after the encounter with the Overlords, it's not very in depth.<br />And then there's the ending, which I didn't like at all.  I won't it away, but I will say that Clarke tries to describe humanity's proper place in the universe.  I felt that the ending was rather shallow and dodged many of the important questions that were raised earlier in the book.  Overall, I found that this book didn't live up to its reputation.	2002-03-09

Over the next five years, I must have read the series at least ten times.  I thought they were the greatest books ever written.  This winter, I found my old copy of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe in the attic and decided to spend one evening rereading it.  It was a bit of a let down; this book doesn't have as much crossover appeal to adults a some other children's fantasy series, such as the Harry Potter books, but I still recommend it.<br />The story, of course, involves four children named Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who wander through a magic wardrobe and into the land of Narnia, inhabited by talking animals and other magical creatures.  They end up taking part in the battle between the lion Aslan (representing Christ) and the evil queen.  A great deal of the book is spent describing landscapes and settings, as well as meals, clothing, etc...  I suppose that children might enjoy that sort of thing, but I found it growing tedious after awhile.  I was also a bit disappointed by the role of Susan.  She seems to be included only to call for help from her brother when she's in danger - not the sort of role model I would want for my daughter.  Other than that, the story is quite well written, and includes many appropriate lessons about repentance, forgiveness, and courage.	2002-02-28

A few years latter, an expedition is sent up the Rhine River to explore the new continent.  The main character of the book is a photographer named Guillford Law who joins the expedition in hopes of becoming famous.  After the expedition is attacked, he is one of the few survivors and becomes caught up in a battle to save the world.  Two other storylines follow Guillford's wife in London and a psychic from the United States.<br />The biggest problem with the book, as others have mentioned, is that the author decides to give away the secret about the disappearance of Europe after just 100 pages.  From there on, the rest of the book grows very confusing.  Wilson tries to wrap all of the diverging plot lines together, but there were so many of them, and the writing was so vague that I couldn't keet track of who was doing what and how each character related to the central storyline.	2002-02-27

It deals with a futuristic war between humans and gigantic starships named berserkers, whose orgins are not revealed in this volume.  While the plot may sound like a cliche, the writing is crisp and original.<br />The best part of the novel is the lengthy chapter in the middle that covers the climactic battle between humanity and the berserkers.  It's a scene of high suspense and excellent descriptions of the action.  Afterwards, there are several chapters pertaining to other incidents that are only loosely connected to the main storyline.  These chapters aren't quite as entertaining, and some of them are downright silly.  It would have been nice if the author had stuck to just one single plotline.  Even so, the overall book is highly original and well worth reading.	2002-02-25

Nothing stands out to make this a good novel, but for some reason I kept turning the pages to find out what happened at the end.<br />The story begins when a missile attack in Siberia leads to rapid global warming and gigantic hurricanes spring up all around the world.  For most of the book, the plot follows the conventions of disaster epics.  We're introduced to a huge cast of characters, including the President of the US, a porn star, a reporter, a businessman, and several scientists.  The characters run into each other on various occasions throughout the novel.  There's a lot of talking about impending disaster, a lot of sex (sometimes both at the same time), a lot of political diatribes, and a lot of action scenes, most of which are fairly well written.  The novel is packed fairly densely with plot, so some of the plot lines don't get developed as much as they should.  Others, such as a ridiculous story about a man trying to avenge his daughter's death, should have been left out entirely.  While there's nothing to make this novel special or memorable, it does keep you reading till the end, just to see how Barnes will wrap up all of his diverging plot lines.	2002-02-17

Bland characters, boring descriptions, ridiculous plot.  I've never read anything else by McCaffrey, and after this, I certainly don't intend to.<br />The story is that an alien species named the Catteni sends some gigantic spaceships to attack the major cities on Earth, where they kill many people and abduct millions of others.  They then dump some of their human prisoners on a planet called Botany in order to see whether they will survive.  The story then follows one woman named Kris as she joins a group of humans and other aliens and they set up a city in a cave.  After that, there is a lot of walking around, exploring the landscape, bumping into other people, etc...  There's very little action or suspense.  The author sets up some mysteries but concerning the planet's original inhabitants, but never bothers to answer them.<br />Anyway, the problems with this novel are too numerous to mention all of them, but here are a few:<br />Humans work side by side with several other species, and there's barely any animosity or mistrust.  Why bother creating other species if they're all going to act, talk, and think exactly like humans do?  And the idea that members of another species could learn to speak English in just a couple weeks is ridiculous.<br />Life on this new world is simply to easy for the settlers.  Everywhere they go, they find abundant food and water.  They're able to defeat an army of machines just by removing their solar panels in the middle of the night (good thing their creators never though of that).  In short, there's never really any threat to the people's survival, and thus no suspense.<br />When people get abducted by aliens, they react like it's a walk in the park.  They don't suffer any psychological trauma, they barely think about home or their former lives at all, and they barely have any concerns or worries about their future.  While I can't personally claim to have been abducted by aliens, this doesn't seem to be like a realistic depiction of the way that humans would respond if they were suddenly torn from their homeland and deposited millions of light-years away.	2002-02-12

Rowling uses a different plot line than she did in the first two books.  Instead of trying to find a villian within Hogwarts, this time Harry is threatened by Sirius Black, the former accomplice to you-know-who.  Black has recently escaped from the prison of Azkaban, where the guards heard him muttering \\"he's at Hogwarts\\".  A group of beings known as dementors are assigned to protect the school, but Black is still able to break in twice.  The suspense comes from the fact that someone in Hogwarts may be assissting him.  Needless to say, there is a final showdown where everything is clearly explained.  This book also features one of Rowling's most likeable characters, Professor Lupin, who helps Harry to overcome his fears.  And it has some more wonderful comedy, including \\"The Monster Book of Monsters\\", a living textbook that tries to bite its owner.  All-in-all, it's a great read.	2002-01-29
US	41549714	RFBYVJYORUPMW	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Great book, questionable philosophy	If you have never read Starship Troopers before, order it and read it now.  Regardless of whether you agree with Heinlein's philosophy or not, I guarantee that you will be unable to put it down.  The core of the story is about Johnnie Rico, who goes through training in a futuristic army and then leaves to battle 'the bugs'.  Heinlein's description of an enemy that is not technologically sophisticated but still incredibly powerful puts some originality into the classic Earth vs. aliens storyline.  Most science fiction and war novels pay fairly little attention to the training and preparation of soldiers.  Heinlein chooses to skimp on the action and instead focuses on the brutal conditions endured by recruits at boot camp, and the way it affects the main character.<br />As for the Heinlein's political philosophy, take it with a grain of salt.  I don't personally think that the system he describes would work.  He never explains what gets done about the military bureaucracy, and there's also the problem of people getting annoyed by the fact that they must pay taxes but aren't allowed to vote.  Even so, Heinlein's ideas are so different from the 'me first, responsibility last' view now preached in American society that they will definetly give you something to think about.	2002-01-29

After a horrible summer with his relatives, Harry returns to Hogwarts in an illegal flying car and gets in trouble right off the bat.  Soon, he hears mysterious voices from within the walls of the school that nobody else is able to hear.  When students start turning to stone, the race is on to find the perpetrator before he/she/it strikes again.<br />The mystery of who is attacking Hogwarts students drives the plot of the book.  In book one, all the clues were designed to point to one suspect.  This time, however, the attacker could be anybody, and there's a clear sense of danger throughout the entire story.  The suspense keeps building until the final fifty pages, when Harry must risk his life to save another student.<br />At the same time, Rowling maintains her sense of humor from the original novel.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets features a 'whomping willow' tree that will hit anybody who comes close, an incredibly arrogant replacement teacher, and mandrake plants that need to mature before they can be used in potions (when several mandrakes hold a party in their pot, it's a sign that they're almost ready).  The book is full of good fun and great excitement.  An enjoyable read for all ages.	2002-01-25

While I do enjoy some science fiction, this one was remarkably boring.  The authors simply don't have the talent necessary to create real suspense.  In addition, this book doesn't feature any of the scientific creativity that marks any good SF works.<br />The Island Worlds is set a few hundred years in the future, when some humans have established colonies in the asteroid belt.  The Earth, meanwhile, is controlled by one government, and a group of bureaucrats is trying to shut down the space exploration industry, leading to a war between the &quot;good guys&quot; in space and the &quot;bad guys&quot; from Earth.  The ending of the book is entirely predictable, and there aren't any major plot events that you can't see coming well in advance.

Of course, author J.K. Rowling is great at creating unforgettable characters and writing wonderful dialogue.  Where she really excels, however, is in shaping the book's plot.  The book is a real page-turner.  Everyone I know who has read the book, be they child or adult, has been unable to put it down.

Heller adopts a completly original style for this work.  He takes scenes of outrageous comedy and mixes them together with brutal descriptions of violent conflict.  The contrast keeps the reader off balance; you never know what to expect next.  Heller's amazing talent as a writer comes through in almost every paragraph.  His dialogue is believable, sharp, and witty; his word choice is very precise; and his descriptions are incredibly powerful.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about the novel is the way that Heller juggles his gigantic cast of characters.<br />So, should you buy &quot;Catch-22&quot;?  Here are a couple sample paragraphs.  If you find these to be funny, you will enjoy the entire novel.<br />&quot;Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre.  Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them.  With Major Major it had been  all three.  Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as one lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were all impressed by how unimpressive he was.<br />Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age.  He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism.  He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down.  His specialty was alfalfa and he made a good thing out of not growing any of it.  The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa that he did not grow.  The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce.  Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa.  On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done.  He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county.  Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money a was therefore wise.  &quot;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&quot; he counseled one and all, and everyone said, &quot;Amen.&quot;	2001-11-25

Horwitz aims to show how memories of the Civil War still resonate with some Southerners and frequently manifest themselves in bizarre forms.  Horwitz gives episodic accounts of his travels in the South, and he has a good sense of the humorous side of every incident.

Most of the five-star reviews are just streams of insults directed against anybody who dares the question the holiness of that almighty Goddess, Ayn Rand.  A few more sophisticated readers have claimed that AS is a philosophical work, so it shouldn't be judged by the standards of literature.  Actually, it is a failure both as a novel and as a work of philosophy.  I will try to explain its failings in both areas.<BR>Atlas Shrugged could serve as the definition of long and tedious.  Not only is it packed with lengthy, boring speeches, but there are many characters who move through the exact same plot devices: they are exploited at the start of the novel, but then `wake up' and realize the importance of individuality.  Several of the superfluous plotlines involving minor characters could have easily been eliminated without harming the overall novel.  Beyond that, the writing is high-school level, with a few big words like \\"sustenance\\" and \\"obligation\\" thrown in to give the illusion that the author is well educated.  The dialogue is cheesy and unrealistic, while most of the plot events feel contrived.  For example, when the Comet gets stuck at a red light for no reason, Dagny just happens to be in the right place to save the day.  Now what are the chances of that?<BR>Many posters have already pointed out that Rand's characters are entirely one-dimensional; they have as much depth as comic book heroes and villains.  Rand fans arrogantly defend Atlas Shrugged by insisting that her heroes represent humanity not as it is, but rather as it should be.  While the idea of a perfect human might be entertaining I fairy tales, it has no place in great literature.  Meaningful books must deal with gritty reality, and feature characters with the same strengths and flaws as real humans.  Even great literary villains such as MacBeth and Ahab are still well-rounded, realisticcharacters with understandable motivations.<BR>But the real purpose of this train wreck (yuk yuk) of a novel is to pound home Rand's personal philosophy.  In fact, she makes her point with a sledgehammer in almost every paragraph, and it's all done with a level of self-righteousness that would make Jerry Falwell blush.  Rand's philosophy can be summarized quite easily.  According to her, the world consists of two groups: a small band of hard-working geniuses who are responsible for everything that goes right in the world, and a majority of wicked, lazy hangers-on, who want to destroy the good people out of sheer evilmindedness.  Not surprisingly, the few virtuous people happen to be the ones who follow Rand's political philosophy to the letter, while everyone else might just as well be shot.  Several posters have remarked that Rand appeals exclusively to 18-year-olds and a handful of academic elitists.  This is easy to understand when you consider the tendency of most young people to avoid responsibility while pinning blame on others.  Atlas Shrugged appeals not to reason, but rather to short-term, stupefied emotional satisfaction.  If you want proof of my characterization of Rand followers, simply read any of the five-star reviews that decorate this web page.  Not only do they all employ remarkably shallow emotional arguments, but most of them are also rife with spelling and grammar errors.<BR>Rand's simplistic views on economics and politics boil down to one statement: government is bad.  Needless to say, if her principles were applied in the real world, disaster would result.  Objectivists constantly remind us that Alan Greenspan is a fan of Ayn Rand.  However, Greenspan's job consists of using the power of government to control the economy.  If he spontaneously adopted Rand's brand of free-for-all capitalism, we'd all be in big trouble.<BR>If you've realized by now that Rand's philosophy is a classic case of a victim complex, give yourself bonus points.  Rand makes the bizarre claim that American businessmen are currently undergoing the worst persecution of any group in history.  In Atlas Shrugged, evil bureaucrats devise wicked, restrictive laws for the sole purpose of spiting entrepreneurs.  Needless to say, the objectivist thugs are unable to provide any real-life examples of such legislation.  Our government allows the wealthy members of the business community to shelter their income from taxes and then gives them multi-million dollar handouts, paid for by the poor and middle class.	2001-10-28

He spends most of the book debunking nonscientific beliefs, but only one chapter is devoted to the actual question of why people believe &quot;weird things&quot; without proof.  Besides that, he includes to many different areas of research, and thus doesn't have time to focus thoroughly one any of them.<br />Why, then, do I give this book four stars?  It is well written and very convincing, and could serve as a good introduction to skeptical thought.  As the tide of pseudoscience rises and people attempt to dismiss rational and reasonable thought, we need good thinkers like Shermer to defend science as what it really is - the attempt by humans to understand the world around us.  Finally, he connects with the audience by providing many humorous annecdotes about his own experience with pseudoscientific liars and examples of scientific thinking gone astray (very, very astray.)<br />The final section of the book, and the best one, covers the phenomenon of Holocaust denial.  This is the most interesting section because it does delve into the psychology of people who want to rewrite history, even though they know that the things they are saying aren't true.  Shermer also points out the urgency of fighting this movement with solid historical fact.<br />The middle section of the book covers the Creationism vs. Evolution debate.  Unfortunately, it is too short to present this topic in great detail.  Contrary to what the review below this one claims, Shermer doesn't insist that Evolution is true because Creationism is false.  However, his purpose in this section is to show how and why Creationists intentionally misrepresent scientific fact, so that is the main focus of these chapters.<br />The opening section is the least useful.  It covers a variety of topics, including UFOs, near-death experiences, and Ayn Rand's cult.  However, the chaptersare quite short, so they can't provide in depth analysis of such phenomenon.	2001-10-13
