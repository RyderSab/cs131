I didn't understand half of Fargo Rock City (the music part) and still liked it.  Sex, Drugs and Coco Puffs is a minor masterpiece of cultural criticism.  This book, is only marginally about rock and roll (yet important).  What rock critic actually say rock critics mean nothing?  Chuck is more concerned with past loves and trying to get on with his life.  Chuck does drugs, drinks, drives (not together), sees much of the country.  He will definately annoy many readers.  Yet, to this reader, there is something poignant about a man (only 2 years older than me) trying to come to terms with himself and his past.  The passage that describes \\"terrifying nostalgia\\" is incredible and resonated with me.  This review might not help you (I expect the unhelpful votes), but it is vote in favor Chuck.

His disgust with nostaglia and Chuck Klosterman (who rocks) and Gen X angered me, but I must admit that he had one valid point.  That is, the stuff we watched as young people wasn't that good, but we love it anyway.  His point about growing up and changing tastes is important.  I don't agree that we should not watched Saved by the Bell if we love it, but do agree that we should also enjoy quality TV.  He nails the FCC, MASH, and other things that are both overrated or underrated.  He falls into the trap overpraising stuff like the X-Files, Buffy, and such.  Those were cult shows and he shows contempt for other cult shows, so he is not really consistent.  WEll, maybe he is.  The point about TV is so many of love it and love to argue about it.

I had the chance to meet Michael Connelly at book signing (an incredibly nice guy) and he told the audience that Harry will be back for several more books.  This one is basically straight police procedural.  If you like those kind of books, you will love this one.  The case is tough, but the mystery is excellent.  I didn't figure it out ahead of time.  It spends only a little time on Harry's personal life (his daughter is mentioned of course).  There is no mention of the woman Harry was involved with at the end of the Narrows, but Harry is never in love for a long time.  CHief Irving is back too.  It is a wonderful novel for those who love great crime dramas and cracking a case.  Harry is older, wiser, and finally settled (mostly).	2005-06-17

Part of it was just being sick the week I read it.  But even more, it was so complex (but not in a good Sopranos sort of way) and perhaps, to steal a word from another review, convoluted.  It was cool that each character had reasons for the behavior, but none of the characters save Loren, Matt, and Olivia are particularly memorable.  Check that.  The \\"dance\\" expert, Lew Friedman was hysterical.  However, the plot doesn't quite come together even though there are some really surprising twists.  I did figure out the very last one early on, but it didn't ruin the book.  The strongest part, as often with Coben's stuff, were the love stories--mother-daughter, father-son, victim-victim (read to understand), and husband wife...<br /><br />Why three stars?  Well, Coben needs to try something new...maybe a new series?  Loren would be a great star.  I'm getting a bit tired of upper middle class New Jersey guys in trouble...<br /><br />In the end, better than a lot of the trash out there, but not his best.  No sir.	2005-05-15

This not a serious book and Smith himself makes no bones about that.  It is filled with the same kind lol jokes that his films are--some dumb--but mostly hilarious.  The pieces cover much of his career the last 8 years or so.  They are from various sources.  With the except of his piece defending Star Wars and his final piece on ComicCon, the book is a great look at Smith.  I happen to be big fan of all of his work (even liked Jersey Girl) and the man himself.  He is humble, self-effacing, and just damned happy to be where he is.  His take on Cruise and Affleck is rare in this media age--he loves these guys and tells us why.  He is still a fan.  He is also a husband and a father--some of the best stuff in here is about that.  And, his essay on New Jersey and his friend Walt was just awesome.  No need to nitpick over the few things don't work--the book is great for any big KS fan.

This book might have been written by any journalist, but this Jewish Brit gets it just right.  He is able to easily (except for a disturbing visit to the Aryan Nation) get to know Randy Weaver and even talk to Bildbergists (who I had no idea existed).  He is incredibly even handed--these guys generally look like fools easily--and fair.  The ending is just fantastic, there is no way these Owl worshippers can look normal.  I was particularly interested in his version of lizard man David Icke's trip to Canada that showed how closed minded both sides could be.  I knew nothing of David Paisley or this Mr. Ru Ru and was entertained.  The book is a bit less light (it was written largely before 9-11) nowawdays, but in terms of Americans and Brits, it is still fitting.  Only a Brit could have seen America like this.	2005-03-29

Parts of me want to say it was outrageous, too many ideas that don't fully work, too long, and basically absurd.  On the other hand, why didn't I put the book down?  Why did I read the whole thing over two days (it takes a longer time than you might expect)?  Why can't I stop thinking about the book and the ending?  Don't worry, I won't dare reveal the ending.  The book has, turns and twists and turns and twists.  Some questions are never answered.  The book pounds away at the imagery of the shadows it becomes far too much.  Still, you read this book and search for ethical answers and find none.  I think that confusion and frustration is intentional.

Over my many years of reading crime fiction, I have been reluctant to tackle too many dectective series novels.  I have trouble reading only book in a series, I like to read them all, and many series are already well developed and it would mean reading 10-20 books.  So, I've picked very carefully.  Harry Bosch (by Michael Connelly) remains my favorite.  When I came across Elvis Cole in one of Bosch's stories, I figured I might just check him out.  I love stories set in LA and Cole's wise cracking private dick was fun.  I started with Demolition Angel and met Carol Starkey.  I end my journey, 11 books later, with Starkey and Cole. After Demolition, went back to read the Cole books in order (with a short detour for the awesome Hostage), and saw the growth of both Crais and his hero.  The last few Cole books have been much darker in tone.  Our heroes, Joe and Elvis, have aged and become injured in many ways.  Love has passed in and out of their lives (Ellen Lang has a very short cameo here--rewarding to long time readers) and Lucy is back for short stint.  Starkey's pain continues.  But the essence of this book, is Elvis' past.  What is unique is that while we learn a lot about his childhood, the actual place where he grew up (a city, a state, etc) is never revealed, which is kind of neat.  He remains rootless in a sense.  I don't want to reveal too much, but coupled with the better novel, the Last Dectective, Elvis is revealed, or much of him.  The mystery here is not that strong, but the comparisons to Elvis' struggles are solid.  Part of me misses the old Elvis, but the Elvis of 18 years ago has changed.  He must.  And, finally, Crais seems to slowly be abandoning the multi-narrator technique (it used here, but more effectively) that has dominated his last books.  I still say LA Requiem is best, so start there if you are new and don't have time.  However, if you want to have a great time, start with the Monkey's Raincoat.  It took me only about 3 months to read all10 Cole novels and was worth the journey.  So my journey with Elvis is over for now and I will miss him and Joe until the next book...and Elvis' journey home just might be over as well.	2005-03-25

THe book isn't quite up to his masterpiece, but is easily the 2nd best of the Cole novels.  As many reviewers have noted, it does not have the huge surprise ending to the mystery, I figured it out much earlier.  Still, the book works because it is focused so tightly on the kidnapping AND on Cole's early life.  We finally learn more details about Cole and Vietnam (which might have been a fine novel right there).  Pike is rare form, esp. at the beginning with the bear.  These are two men who have deepened as Crais has.  Lucy is back and while Ben's kidnapping makes for a great story, there relationship just isn't working.  I was never a big fan of hers, although I am not quite sure why.  Starkey is back and even cooler than in Demolition Angel.  John Chen is back as well and continues to crack me up with constant search for women (and still he fails).  Also, there is a wonderful nod to Harry Bosch in the middle when Elvis sees Bosch at the Hollywood Station turning in his retirement papers.  Michael Connelly would return the nod with a much shorter sequence in one his later books.  I wonder if Cole and Bosch ever teamed up...my two favorite detectives....oh my dreaming is getting ahead--although Cole does hint that he thinks Bosch would understand him, and indeed he would.  Oh well.  I love when writers tip their caps to each other.  I've now read all but the Forgotten Man.  Crais is great, but I do wish, as he has done for the last 4 books, find a different technique besides the overlapping narratives from different viewpoints.  It works, but is getting stale.  Still, one of the best.	2005-03-24

A jewish boxer cop in Austin?  Cool stuff.  The story is complex and has solid twists and turns (if does get a bit nutty at the end--too much?  That is for each reader to decide).  However, the Reles character does indeed keep the book going and I look forward to other adventures with him.  The book twists enough cop book cliches to keep it interesting.  However, this one novel does not a James Ellroy make.  THe opening chapters do sound a lot like Ellroy's trademark staccato style, but the narrative style is not enough to make a fair comparison.  Perhaps, a few books down the line, Simon will be fairly compared with one of the greatest living American writers.  Give the man some breathing room!	2005-03-22

This book has  bit of everything.  I've been an AJ Jacobs fan since his halycon days at EW and enjoy his work at Esquire now.  He is really, really funny.  The book is unique and I love the idea of his quest.  He is honest, self-deprecating, and oh wait, I already said honest.  It is remarkable how honest.  He voices his most petty thoughts and it is refreshing to see.  The facts we learn are indeed interesting (if a bit much at times)and his adventures (particularly his day as a 6th grader and adventure on Millionaire) are hilarious. I did find it a bit too long winded at times, but maybe because I read most it of it in a 3 sittings and didn't take time to enjoy the book over several days?! What sticks with me the most?  His relationship with his father and his love for his wife and unborn son.  Those moments of levity are really what I will remember.  I hope these lessons won't \\"pass\\" too quickly.	2005-03-21

This is an excellent, if a bit uncomfortable, read.  There is no need for me to sum up the plot--it is obivous.  I was not expecting a strong family drama to be at the heart of the book--I'm glad it is there.  Roth's love of his family (fictionalized as it may be) and the strength of the Jews in the book is remarkable.  Roth comments a great deal on the differing views of Jews among themselves through the characters of his brother and Rabbi BEngelsdorf.  His father is a proud man and his mother not quite saintly, but certainly an idealized type.  Yet, they are all real in a sense.  The book seems to go a bit out of control with it's ending conspiracy theory, but even Roth tells us to take it with grain of salt. It is also a wry commentary on America's need for conspiracy theories.  One might also see deeply buried allusions to 2004 or 2000, but that is only there if you want to see it.  I'm still not sure that history would have followed the same course as it does after the end of the Lindbergh years (I won't say more than to say that), but even the history is solid.  Was Lindy this big a fascist?  Who knows.  Still, I think it is a worthy exercise in \\"what if\\" history...it is NOT science fiction like so many other books in that genre and that is a good thing.  The book is not perfect, some of the symbols are too heavy handed (the stamp collection for example), but still worthy of your time.  An important meditation on American (and Jewish) history.	2005-03-16

Requiem (Elvis Cole)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Crais' Masterpiece...A true "must read"	It is funny, I don't usually pay much attention to the little plugs that author's give one another, but sometimes, they are not just selling a friend's book, but actually are right.  I came to Robert Crais' after reading all the Harry Bosch novels.  There is a small scene where Bosch acknowleges Cole in one of the later Bosch novels--a simple scene where they drive past each other.  COnnelly liked Crais, which was good enough for me.  I read Demolition Angel (which is good) and Hostage (which I loved--please, Bruce Willis don't make a bad movie from a great book) and turned to Cole--from the beginning.   <br /> <br />All of the books in the series are really good.  However, the earliest books, nominated for awards even, were a bit thin and airy.  The stories were usually fun, but the stakes weren't too high.  As the series goes on, Crais and his characters grow.  By Free Fall, things change.  Elvis deepens.  He falls in love.  He saves and the plot does indeed thicken.  However, my biggest complaint was the lack of \\"backstory\\" on Elvis and Joe.  I loved Joe, but why didn't he smile?  Why did Elvis come to LA (we still don't know, but I think we learn that in the next two books).  LA Requiem was the book I was most looking forward to reading and made all that came before worth the time and expense.  That is not say you won't enjoy the novel if you don't read others first, just that this is a richer experience with the history behind it. <br /> <br />All of that said, I was not prepared for how incredible Requiem would be.  On the front, David Balldaci (a writer I have not write) called it one of the best crime novels he had ever read.  He was right.  It is a masterpiece.  It rivals Connelly's best and has echoes of James Ellroy.  For me, that is high praise, as those are my two favorite crime writers.  I'm sure it also harkens back to earlier masters, but, alas, I have not read them yet.   <br /> <br />I don't want to say too much about the plot, except to say I could not put the book down.  The last chapter is lyrical and beautiful and moving.  The book is sad, so very sad, yet hopefully.  Joe is finally revealed (mostly).  Elvis becomes a man in crisis, but is revealed to be even better than we thought.  Lucy?  Some mysteries still there.  I must admit that Chen gave me some laughs and I hated Krantz (too over the top?).  The book is really one of the finest pieces of mystery fiction to come along.  It will remain one of my most favorite novels.  A true masterpiece.  I'm nervous to finish out the series.  One, because I will miss it.  And two, because I wonder if anyone can write this well again.  A gigantic leap forward and worth all the time you put in, even if I will only have 4 hours of sleep before work...	2005-03-08

Another homerun (although he would not like that analogy for this particular book) for Kahn.  He is America's finest bard of baseball (some may disagree, but as Kahn would say, this is the writer's opinion).  This is a fascinating look at pitching history through interviews (and historical documents) with the men who created it.  From Ol' Hoss Radbourn (pitched over 600 innings and won 60 games in a season) to Christy Matthewson to Bob Gibson (who I wish had more than 10 or so pages) to Leo Mazzone, the book is wide in scope and stories.  The book rambles a bit, but frankly the ride is worth taking.  For anybody who loves the greatest of all games, this book will give you a new view of the men who make or break it.

This book is great if you are looking for a travelogue of Italy.  However, that isn't why I bought the book.  I had hoped for some exciting action, cool inside stories of the government, and a character who you felt might actually not make it.  Instead, we get a majorly convoluted story, a climax where you never once have any doubt about how the story will turn out, and a lame ending.  In fact, in the afterward, JG brags about his lack of research on government agencies.  This is something to be proud of?  I think not.  He has become lazy.  I guess that happens when you write your best book first and then only write something decent every few years.  This isn't one of them.	2005-02-21

This, unlike, say, Pete Rose's book last year, is one book I had to read as soon as it came out.  Simply written (no co-author is noted, but he must not have been very good), the book flies by.  Of course, the media has leaked much of the good stuff already.  As with any memoir (again, a stretch to use that word), truth is often muddled.  Here it is worse.  Did baseball really blackball Jose?  Did Roger Clemens use steroids?  Dave Martinez (that was funny--he was so mediocore)?  Jose is clearly bitter for the way he was treated over the years.  I can't possibly understand what it was like for a Latino ballplayer in the mid-80s.  When he describes the racism involved in the game, much of it rings true.  His bittnerness toward Cal Ripken (I'm assuming details were left out to avoid libel suits--common throughout the book) seems more mysterious.  He is right that media (and the umps) play favorites sometimes.  There is no question he is right about certain players and their steriod use.  His digs at Mark McGwire are not cheap shots (pun intended).  Mac was never the nice guy that we often heard about.  He was surly, angry, and quite possibly a fraud.  Same with Sammy \\"The Diva\\" Sosa.  Each of these guys did a ton of stuff for charity.  So did Canseco (which, immodestly, he points out)...but who knew that about Canseco?  Not me.   <br /> <br />Where he runs into trouble, at least for this reader, is his insistence on how good steroids are.  The only steroids I ever took were for an infection and hope I never have to take them again.  They can be great (look at how they saved Jerry Lewis--and how puffy he got) as medicine perhaps.  But, his insistence on their goodness is a bit scary.  Still, the man is a true believer.  I just hope kids don't read this as the gospel.  And the fact is, Canseco, Mac, etc, all cheated.  He doesn't seem to care.  Then again, I think the service he is doing to baseball is far more important.  His book won't let the Barry Bonds' of the worldkeep fooling us. <br /> <br />Canseco also brushes over his marriages and the vast majority of his playing career (this is not a book that talks about the game between the lines).  He claims to be unfairly persecuted by the Florida DA...the truth?  Who knows?  He claims to have had a nervous breakdown, but doesn't back it up.  Who knows? <br /> <br />Finally, I think what might stay with me (besides the steroid stories) are the geniune moments.  His hilariously overblown \\"affair\\" with Madonna.  His near-suicide is poignant.  I have no doubt he loves his daughter deeply.  His pain over his break up with his second wife (everyone feels this kind of pain, even stars).  The saddest part is the that deep inside his massive body, he is still a little hurting boy.  He is very cautious about how he describes his father, but reading between the lines, we see a sad little boy and sad man.  His father was incredibly tough on him.  His mother died when he was barely out of his teens and she was his protector.  Much of his career and incidents can be seen as a man looking for his fathers protection (his constant mentions of his insecurity) and the love of his mother (which he so sadly lost when she passed away).  He has made some bad choices, but, in the end, he needs so much attention, because he never got it from the most important man in his life.  All very sad.  I think this book will serve an important purpose for our nation's past time and maybe help Canseco grow...maybe.	2005-02-15

It is a bit dated now, but still a good thriller and mystery.  Elvis again proves his mettle and morals.  Pike continues to impress.  Not the best of the books, but you can't help but love Elvis.  Crais describes all parts of LA beautifully.  I still want to know  more of Elvis' backstory and the lack of info is a bit frustrating, but this is only the 4th novel.

This is a terrific book.  It balances nicely between an inside look (and it is quite honest about the players and other characters, showing their true human qualities--it does not pretty them up) and an ode to the one of the last places where the true spirit of the game lives.  I had long known of the league, but mostly through the reports of Peter Gammons and Baseball America.  It was all numbers and thumb nail scouting reports.  This book added layer after layer of humanity to these guys.  It also captures quite beautifully the connection of the game and the mythical qualities and the small town virtues.  It doesn't overdo it either.  The touches are excellent.  The narrative is a bit meandering at times, but that is ok, so is the game.  A beautiful tribute to the men (mostly Pauly, D'Antona, and Stauffer) and a game that is timeless.  Thank you Jim Collins.	2005-01-24

This is not Crais' best, but another worthy entry into the Cole-Pike series.  This one, interestingly, takes place in the mafia world and NY/CT/NJ tri-state area.  It is a good jolt to have the story--a darkish one--take place out there.  The characters remain fresh and we even have some visits from some old characters (I love this--always great to reward long time fans with visits from characters from other books).  Cole is still a mystery at this point (unlike Bosch, we don't know much about him yet and I'm reading the books in order).  My only criticism of this volume is that Peter Alan Nelsen is a little too cartoonish for my tastes, but otherwise, a great book. <br /> <br />	2005-01-19

A friend told me she loved the first 2/3 and the last part essentially went off the rails.  The last section/ending is a bit bizarre, but it somehow true.  Some characters find grace, others redemption, others are only begining to see life as it really it is.  Is it satire?  A suburban fable?  I'm not sure that it matters.  Perrotta adroitly captures those days when you realize that you are an adult with responsiblities you couldn't have imagined a few short years earlier.   Everyone is growing up here and trying to recapture their youth at the same time.  It is theme we see both in the Wishbones (a fun book) and Joe College(fun but not perfect)...however, here Perrotta reaches a new complexity and depth.  I'm still not sure what to make of Ronnie's character, but will leave that to each reader.    I find it fascinating that Perrotta sets the book in the summer months before 9/11.  He does not use 9/11 as a cheap cliche (as some writers have) and it is indeed never mentioned (but he accurately captures that last innocent summer-Gary Condit, Shark attacks, etc).   Instead, the characters live their last innocent summer as many Americans did before 9/11.  It is subtle, but it is another layer on which the book words.    There isn't a person here who is perfect or entirely lovable (except maybe little Aaron) and that is just as real as life.  Without giving away anything, the last scene is both improbable and incredibly real (see the last paragraph).  It works.  It does for me.	2005-01-15

Costas' book is far from perfect, however his ultimate conclusions (though not original) make sense.  And he is right.  As we see a .267 hitter like Carlos Beltran make over $100 million (okay, maybe he is much better than that) and a medicore pitcher like Kris Benson make $7 million a year (not mention Jaret Wright's contract) in 2004 (oh and Russ Ortiz for $32 million?), Costas' ideas ring even truer.  Some of the arguments are dated--esp. his section on the wild card.  He was right about the unbalanced sked. which has come into being.  The major flaw in the book is that Costas simply repeats himself too much.  We get it Bob--a salary cap is good.  So is revenue sharing.  Etc....this is a big criticism when a book is under 200 pages.  The last work stoppage was avoided and that was good.  Costas was again right in blaming the players who look worse today than ever (although owners are still not so great)--esp. in light of steroid issues.  Baseball is moving toward a salary cap (Bud wants one)...So, overall Costas case is compelling.  The one other issue I have is with Costas condemning \\"traditionalists.\\"  He claims not to be one and then spends 20 pages or so decrying the wild card and \\"destruction\\" of the pennant race.  That is a bit much.  And sounds like a traditionalist to me.  He slams people who love the poetic, transcendent, and Kinsellaian (I made up a term) nature of the game.  Considering the steroid scandal, for example, I'll take W.P. Kinsella anyday.  Overall, though, I give Costas 4 stars and it was cool to see him stand up for the fans.	2005-01-08

Having seen the movie years ago and (I know I am in the minority) not loving it, but at least feeling happy with the end, I assumed that the book was somewhat similar.  The book is so very sad, but if you read (and you should), you will see that it stays true to Malamud's viewpoint all along.  The ending fits.  There is much symbolism and good vs. evil and all that good stuff.  In the end, it is an American tragedy, I think.  A nicely written and very sad look at sport.  And one that is still relevant today.	2005-01-07

The characters are all interesting and the mysteries (yes, plural) are interesting.  There are no absurd scenes where the killer explains it all...just good dectective work.  At times she seems a bit like other Miami authors with bizarre car chases or odd family histories, but overall the book works.  I have not read the Britt Montero mysteries, but perhaps these are not entirely new characters to those fans.  However, as a stand alone, this is a good solid mystery.	2005-01-05

As a much older man, I watched Okrent on Ken Burns' Baseball and enjoyed his witty thoughts.  Finally, I came to 9 Innings.  It is a terrific read.  What a great idea to look at the world of baseball through the lens of one game.  It was a fascinating look at the game and the Brewers in the their brief glory days.  Everything from the grounds crew to the ownership books was noted.  The game, between the AL Champion '82 Brewers and the soon to be World Champion '83 Orioles, was entertaining.   But, the picture of life in a small market and behind the scenes stuff is the best.  The updates at the end strangely gloss over a Brewers team that came within one win of the World Championship and ignore the Orioles championships (and Hall of Famers Murray and Ripken) entirely.  That is ok.  A brillant book by a real traditionalist.  Not dated if you are a true fan.	2005-01-04

Not being intimately familar with that controversy, I read this book with an open mind.  I knew Goodwin from her many TV pundit jobs and her wonderful memories in Ken Burns' \\"Baseball\\" (an unparalleled work of genius by the way).  Anyway, I loved the book.  It is another a long line of wonderful Dodger books.  However, this one has a special touch of being the memories of a young girl (a perspective one still does not hear enough about sports) and her homelife.  Goodwin's father and mother were wonderful people.  Her memories of her growning in the '50s reminded of the emotions evoked by the seminal TV series The Wonder Years a decade or so later.  She writes beautifully of how the world (her world really) lost it's innocence when the Dodgers left.  How she lost her mother, friends, etc.  She talks briefly of her wonderful transformation from Brooklyn to Boston fan and her own family.  The story left me in tears.  A beautiful piece of personal history.  As a history teacher and Cubs fan (with Brooklyn Dodger blood from my ancestors), I was moved and this is indeed history at it's best.  Detailed, filled with awe and honor, and always personal.	2005-01-01

As someone who has spent his life in private schools, both as student and teacher/administrator, there is a lot of truth in this book.  I have many friends from the NY private schools and this indeed rings true.  Fortunately for me, the people I know at private schools aren't this bad.  However, the character types are out there.  I found Helen a bit hard to love, but perhaps that is me.  The kids in the book are terrific, particularly Julian and Zoe.  Michael and Sara have true hearts.  Pamela is way over the top, but her scandals aren't.  A good book, that at times is clearly a first novel.  However, like the Nanny Diaries, you will laugh a lot and recognize people you know (if you know this world).  Since I'm not a mother, perhaps I didn't relate to it all, but still a rare and fun read.	2004-12-30

The book is like an orchestra that is tuned beautifully by Crais, the maestro.  It is one of the better thrillers you will read.  Oh, sure, the concidences are many, but it really does work.  The multivoiced narrators work beautifully (even more strongly than Demolition ANgel).  The tension builds and the twists don't stop coming.  It is mysterious, exciting, and as many of these books are about redemption.  I read that this will soon be a movie with BRuce Willis.  I'm sure that will be fine but I can't believe the movie will be better than this fantastic book.  Crais keeps getting better and better.	2004-12-28

After enjoying Demolition Angel, I made the commitment to go back and read all the Elvis Cole books in order.  I love to read a series in the correct order to watch the growth of the author (who by Demolition Angel, a stand alone, was a great writer) and his characters.  The leap from the Monkey's Raincoat to STalking the Angel was pretty big.  Characters have more depth--esp. Elvis.  Instead of sleeping around, drinking, and wisecracking, we get a glimpse (and just a glimpse) into Elvis' soul.  The book is fast paced and funny, but also sad.  Crais has created a terrific series and I plan to read all of them even if takes me years.	2004-12-27

But former movie exec David Rosenfelt again writes a screenplay.  It is a bit deeper than his first novel, but most of the characters and plot lines are flimsy.  It is quick read and Andy keeps it funny.  However, if you like the character type, you are much better off reading William Lashner's books about similar character.  Not a bad book, but not worthy in my mind of consideration of great legal thrillers.	2004-12-25

Crais and Elvis Cole, I imagine, will grow after this book.  This was short read, but took me a long time to get through.  The book didn't flow as well as Demolition Angel did.  Cole however is really cool character as is Joe Pike.  The odd pairing works.  This book is a bit dated now, almost 17 years later.  The story is not all that deep or surprising, but still fun.  However, I think I will continue to visit with Elvis and his world and see how he has grown.	2004-12-22

Crais' \\"Demolition Angel\\" was good place to start in order to sample this praised writer.  It was a fun and suspenseful read.  The plot was twisting, but never pandering.  The characters are strong and LA plays a part as it should.  Starkey is hard to love, but you embrace her anyway.  It is not easy to pull off a female heroine in this genre (when written by a man I mean), yet Crais does it.  What's next?  Elvis Cole.  Crais has me hooked.	2004-12-13

Guest's book transcends the standard thriller/whodunit...thankfully it did not have a some stupid action scene or the usual scene where the cops explain the entire \\"whys\\" of the crime.  One of the cool things about this book is that Guest never fully explains the whys of the murders.  The whodunit is not completely impossible to figure, but as you read it, you might well be surprised along the way.  The characters are people you are care about (however Karen might be a bit too perfect) and Hugh is wonderful.  It reads fast, but not because it lightweight.  It is welcome addition to the genre and well worth your time.	2004-11-30

It should come as no surprise that Rosenfelt is a former Hollywood marketing executive.  If this book were a movie (and it does read like a typical screenplay) it would be a solid \\"rental,\\" two and half stars.  The book is about as deep as my finger nail, but the story flies by.  Andy is a good guy.  You can't help but like him.  For that reason, I will probably read more of the Andy Carpenter books.  The disappointing thing is, of course, the lack of depth.  I hoping that Rosenfelt grows a novelist.  Because Carpenter is worth keeping around.	2004-11-27

It is a silly, outlandish, and probably pure fantasy, but it works if you allow yourself to be taken along for the ride.  Parts of it are laugh outloud funny.  Straw is a sweet guy at heart, if bumbling.  A few of the letters, written in his moments of strongest despair, are almost moving.  Particularly the one where he mentions the volleyball game (I won't say more).  The Amazon corp. review thinks the end might be just imagined.  I refuse to think that.  Instead, as Sid says, it is about hope.  It is about learning and bettering yourself and hoping someone, even Heather Locklear, will notice.  I hope you she saw and loved this tribute to her.

March is a very strong character, one that you look forward to growing with.  The is not wholly original, but still a well done thriller.  The ending has twists and turns that don't strain credibility (a huge advantage in this day and age of insane \\"top this\\" thrillers) and offer some geniune surprises.  Spiegleman spends far too much time detailing the minute details of apartments and couches and features of minor characters, but that is typical of some first time authors.

THe book moves at a fast clip (although a bit more action might have been welcome in the middle) and has a comic sensibility.  It is also surprising and the mystery is geniune.

When I read Michael Connelly's endorsement of this book (and saw it wasn't a typical blurb, but actually a true respect for Riehl), I knew I would like Quantico Rules.   It is a very solid first thriller.  Monk is a terrific lead (and flawed!).  Lisa is fairly well drawn.  The other characters are bit two dimensional, but they aren't that vital.

Adam is a good guy and you root for him.  My only big issue?  Eljiah, Jock's son, supposedly went to Haverford College (a Quaker college) and had a heroin problem.

He brings his characters to life in a way that few in this genre do (are you listening John Grisham?).  THe story works so very until the last 50 pages or so.  Each revelation is more outlandish than the next.  There is an overly long scene where the killer explains his motivates and pieces together the whole plot.

However, the book is about 200 pages too long.  The story had tons of potential to be a fascinating look at the Marshals and modern LA.  It is neither.  Instead, it is one long action sequence with some tear jerking thrown in.  The murder is terirble and sad--Ginny's that is.  Otherwise, the other characters are relatively two dimensional.

What's Wrong with Dorfman, Blumenthal's first novel was a mere trifle.  Millard Fillmore is much better book, if not a great work of literature.  Like Dorfman, we get another neurotic emotional stunted man, in Fussell.  Still, he is embued with some very engaging quirks; esp. his love of Millard Fillmore.  The characters, esp. Dr. Wang are odd and somewhat lovable.  The revelations that come out as the novel moves on are often outrageous, but it all fits.

THe key, I think, was the fact that the book was told in the first person.  It gave the series a jolt of caffeine.  The book is more hopeful than many in the series.  The characters continue to grow.  As we have traveled with Harry these many years from Eleanor to Jazz to the teacher to Teresa to Eleanor to Julia and then to the exciting and surprising conclusion of Lost Light, the women in his life (not to mention Kiz and his mother, but those are different--well his mother not so much, but I digress), have always been Harry's light.  I started this series at the end with the Narrows, but I went back and read every book in the series (and the excellent Blood work) and fell in love.

Still, Bosch is alone and ready to do more damage, which in this case is quite good.	2004-09-12

After two weaker efforts, Angels Flight and Void Moon, Connelly is back with a vegenance here (in more ways than one).  The story is tight and very noir.  This is not happy story for either bosch or terry.  It probes motive and explores the pysches of both burdened men.  It has the usual brillant touches--a paragraph where Bosch sees Thelma from Void Moon going back to work--and a note about selling the TV and Movie rights to Blood Work.  Jack McEvoy is here and still a bit sleazy (although his sleaze factor is no where near that of earlier reporters in this series).  A bit outlandish at times, but overall a wonderful book that explores motives and behaviors of the good guys.	2004-09-06

They were fairly lean and mean (to use Harry's rhyming).  THe characters of Harry and Carson were interesting.  Ava had some interesting shadings.  Then it became long--even the end was unending--and the everything went to hell.  There are more crazies here than are realistic and more plot twists than are believable.  The end has the feel of a lame 2 star film that has too many cooks in the broth.  Promising characters, but really nutso climax.	2004-09-06

I saw the movie before I even knew who Michael Connelly was.  I backed into my love affair with Connelly's books...I read Chasing the Dime last year and the Poet soon after.  Then I found Void Moon, which I liked, and the Narrows which I loved.  And then I went backwards to Harry Bosch.  So, after the Narrows where Terry dies (nothing given away there folks), I started fresh with Harry and Terry.  The book is a solid love story, exceptional police procedural, and has a tightness the movie lacks.  I mean, Buddy as the killer?  Even Buddy maligns that choice in the Narrows.  The conclusion to the novel is far better!	2004-08-25

Of course, it's lessons go so very deep.  Fathers, sons, traditions, expectations, choices, responsibility to name so very few.  Told against the backdrop of the the end of second World War and the founding of Israel, the story is timeless.  Although it certainly doesn't hurt to be well versed in Jewish history, this book is about applicable to all young people (and the not so young).  A beautiful tale of coming of age and learning.	2004-08-22

This is probably Connelly's weakest Bosch novel (I have read the first 5 and the Narrows, so I have 4 more to go)...I loved the end and the geniunely shocking twists and turns (first about 1/2 way through and the second about 15 pages from the end).  Billets and Rider are super new characters.  However, the plot was meandering and overly complicated.  How many IAD investigations/suspensions is Harry going to deal with?  And the plot was not overly exciting or engaging.  Still, it is Bosch and Connelly is probably the best mystery writer going to day.	2004-08-22

This one goes straight for Harry's heart.  Everything in his life broken (yes, even more broken than usual) and he goes straight into what he calls in Concrete Blonde the \\"dark heart.\\"  Harry finally begins to solve the murder of his mother (again, I could not help but think of James Ellroy's real life struggles) and his own guilt.  Some of the twists here are indeed shocking--Pounds for example, but again Irving surpises and we meet some new stars--Russell, Jazz, and even a decent IAD cop.  When the story threatens to go off the tracks, connelly brings it back and adds a final surprise just at the end.  This guy is SO good.	2004-08-20

This is the third I have read in a row and 4th overall (I started at the end with the Narrows).  Of the early novels, this is the best.  It is an elegy for LA.  It rings of James Ellroy.  I mean that as a very high compliment.  The novel is again a super mystery, with good twists and turns.  But what makes this so superior is the depth of the characters.  It is rare in this genre to see such depth.  Bravo and on to the Last Coyote.	2004-08-19

Bosch figures out a series of drug related murders and the puzzle fits nicely.  Connelly jumps expertly from the FBI/Break in caper of the first novel to the DEA/drug murders of the second.  Is Black Ice real?  It certainly seemed to be.  Bosch also continues to grow as character--as do Irving and others.  A superior mystery.	2004-08-17

I've read almost all of Connelly's stand alone novels (excepting Blood Work, but something tells me I will read that one day too)...Chasing the Dime, Void Moon, The Poet, and the Narrows.  It wasn't until the Narrows that I met Harry Bosch.  I tend to avoid getting into series if I can help it--unless I start at the beginning with a character (for example, I adore Victor Carl in the William Lashner series).  It is mostly because I don't the attention span to go back and read all the novels in a series...who has time to read 8 or 10 or 12 novels when there is so much out there to be read?  Well, the Narrows convinced me that Bosch was a worthy exception to my very odd rule.  This novel is one of the finest dectective novels I have read.  I'm stunned that it was a first novel.  It is not very dated--except the complete lack of cell phones and computers--and holds up beautifully.  THe characters are complex and the story easy to follow but filled with wonderful details that hold upon further review.  What's next?  Black Ice of course... <br />	2004-08-17

As usual, the book is great fun to read, even if the reasons for the murders (which I shall not reveal) are quite serious.  The book is not as good as Monkeewrench.  This is far more a dectective story--which I usually love--but tends to slow down in the last 75 pages.  There are some nifty twists, but I figured a lot of them out.  These books usually sink or swim on the strength of their characters--Leo, Gloria, the Monkeewrench gang, charlie the dog, the Chief (when was a chief actually made out to be a good guy and not a heartless bureaucrat!) etc.  And these are great characters...I hope the next one is a bit more exciting...but this is still fun...	2004-08-12

The accountant as hero part is surprisingly compelling.  The twists and turns and red herrings keep you from figuring out the entire plot until the end.

The first book in the series, The Courier felt like a book that was written with an outline and kept too simple. However,the best part of the book was Simon. This book is a quantam leap forward. It is far more engrossing. The characters are much sharper and well defined. Jake is fascinating and Caity is intriguing. The book does not skimp on thrills either. I'm so glad that MacLarty stays true to the character. Simon is still a bit overweight and mourning the death of his true love. My only issue with this story is the lack of a motive for the &quot;inside&quot; partner to the Duckman. Why did this person do it? I wasn't convinced. However, that is really minor. The book is great fun.	2004-08-06

Not an overly complex story--it is actually fairly simple.  I wish there were more intriguing twists and turns.  However, Simon and Lara are really promising characters.

I was a bit disappointed in the book because it was billed as 'medical-ethical thriller', but was much more a quiet look at an American family.  That is not a problem of course, just what I expected.  It is a book of quiet grace.  The characters are all fleshed out and almost like people we know.  They have real concerns, real ideas, real problems.  The story has it's ups and downs, as in real life...it does not have huge, shattering plots twists--again, that is just right for the novel.

Past Due was a lot of fun to read...the plot contained the important twists and turns, but did not feel as desperate as some of the other stories--indeed, Victor was more in control.  It was fun to see McDeiss, Larry, Skink again.  Where was Morris?  I love Morris.  I miss Morris.  Anyway, the real strength of this story was the way Victor continued to come to terms with himself.

This effort is more ambitious, but not quite (in my opinion)as good.  Some of it cliche, some of it is not needed (really Tallon?  Come on...what a goofy character).  On the other hand, Tropper is still very good at conveying emotions and capturing the pain of youth and finally growing up.  One other issue, why don't we learn more about what has happened to Carly?  She is still very underdeveloped.  OVerall, Tropper avoids the sophomore slump, but I think he tries to do too much...	2004-07-31

This was a book I snapped up the minute I saw it. Autobiographical essays/hip examinations of the modern life are something I love to read (although I have yet to read David Sedaris--so sue me). Hyman is wonderfully aware of his self serving book--I mean, it is after all, all about him. However, his book is hit or miss. Some of the prose just falls flat. The jokes about Norman Fell, Abe Vigoda, Nick Hornby, and such are overdone in this genre (and in the fictional counterpart to chick lit--whatever they call it) and so is the Sanford and Son joke (also the Charles in Charge joke). His essay about Seven Habits of people unemployed was far too long--the joke didn't work. However, there is much of promise here. His essays on Waspy Jews, Airplanes, dating (of which there are several), and his Mexican drug adventure were outstanding. He clearly loves his family and wants to be happy. And--he is smart, hip, and urbane. His book is far better than say, Rick Marin's &quot;Cad&quot; (yes, Hyman does use the term toxic bachelor). He puts in plug for Toby YOung, who also plugs Hyman's book on the cover. He is not yet in the realm of my favorite essayists, Joe Queenan, Chuck Klosterman, and Amy Vowell. And any guy who mentions Whit Stillman is ok with me. A promising, if uneven debut. Most of all, I hope he finds someone to love. He seems to deserve it.	2004-07-29

This short essay is enlightening and thoughtful.  It did not change my own position on the death penalty, but did indeed, deepen my understanding of this most controversial subject.  It is fascinating to trace Turow's own education on the subject.  You won't look at this issue as black and white again.  However, there is one subtle flaw--Eddie Murphy did not play Alex Foley in 48 Hours as Turow claims--it was in Beverly Hills Cop that Alex Foley was found.  Simple error, but certainly a reversible one.	2004-07-29

I've read several of Connelly's stand alone novels and was pleased to see so many of those come together here.  A sharp eyed reviewer even caught Cassie Black's cameo--I missed it, but that is so cool.  VOid Moon and the Poet and the Bosch books come together--and Blood Work as well.  Connelly makes this book relentlessly up to date--he even mentions the tepid box office performance of the Eastwood film!  It was hilarious.  Buddy even complains that he is made to be the villian in the film.  There are also references to Robert Blake, Elizabeth Smart, and Laci Peterson.  It is a small thing, but helps ground the novel in reality.  We aren't searching to find out WHO murdered these people, but more the why.  It is a fantastic work, taut, smart, and even smart.  Now, since I just love Harry, I have to go read all the Bosch novels.  Smart guy that Connelly...	2004-07-28

Not the myth, not the hero worshipping, just the man. This is not a style of &quot;popular&quot; biography. It is not a sweeping narrative, but a more detailed look at Lincoln's life. Some parts of the story, those of his campaigns get surprisingly long treatment here. Others, his marriage, family, and other personal foibles are not explored in depth. However, it is an honest rendering of the man who lived from 1809-1865. In fact, we see the growth, the honor, and the greatness of the real Lincoln.	2004-07-27

From the horrible Rovner women to the amazing Wasserstroms to the extraordinary Muley, the wonders never cease.  I had hoped it would be equal Fabulous Small Jews, which was an older man's version of Chicago Jewish life.  It was well beyond that outstanding collection.  It is funny, warm, and so real to life that is amazing.  It is rings so true--whatever your background--that you will be amazed.  You won't be able to stop thinking about it.  I love this book.

Fatal Flaw is far better than Bitter Truth, in league with the first book in the series, Hostile Witness.  This book is lengthy, but does not feel overly long.  The long, wandering passages of Bitter Truth are no where to be found (nor are any references to that story).  A twisting, turning, but never hard to follow plot keeps you intrigued.  And Victor, while not more successful, really has grown up.  Well, not in his choice of women, but certainly in his understanding and the fact that he is not striving for money here.  That is a refreshing change.  I was still annoyed to see Beth as a secondary character.  Even more, why the heck was Morris Kapustin ignored (ok, there was one mention).  Couldn't have been used in some way?  Oh, those are minor quibbles (as Skink is a good PI).  I look forward to the next adventure of Victor Carl.	2004-07-18

I kept wondering to myself why didn't he hire a private eye to solve the mystery?  And then I realized that is not a traditional mystery novel.

The story is convoluted, but at least the main plot is interesting--just who is the evil force behind the Pickle family?  And Carl is so darned interesting.  I love Morris as always.  I noticed that this book was called Vertias first and there was almost a 6 year lag between novels for our boy Lashner...I hope that Fatal Flaw is better.

A really interesting look at a fascinating (if overanalyzed) man.  The book is far from perfect--the 40 chapters do overlap and can be repetitive--but is really worth reading.  The various perspectives remind anyone interested in history that the meaning of it all depends on where you are standing and where you look.  Churchill was a great man and I learned many great facts, stories, and and perspectives from this unique book.  It works another level as well--as a critique of the biographical form.

As a former resident of the Main Line so derided in this book, I was thrilled to read it (as you might NOT have expected).  Lashner honestly protrays a man who wants so much, but realizes what he wants isn't worth the price.  He accurately captures the desires of people both on the Main Line and those wanting to be there.  There was often a dark story hidden behind the well manicured lawns of the wealthier parts of the area (so many murders).  He has also created some awesome characters starting with Victor Carl.  He is hard on himself, but so very honest.  Is anyone better than Morris Kasputin?  What a creation!  I enjoyed Beth and ADA Solcum as well.  The book has some solid twists and turns and can be funny as well as dark.  My only complaint is that is too long--cut maybe 50-100 pages and you have home run.  However, this is a first book, so who cares that much?  On to the next Victor Carl novel!  One more hurrah for Mr. Lashner, he does not over do it on the court room stuff--I liked that alot.	2004-07-05

To this day, some 17 years later, I have no idea what drew me to the second floor of that bookstore.  There, among the stacks, I found a fantastical book called the Iowa Baseball Confederacy by a W.P. Kinsella.  It was summer outside and yet, I was drawn to this obscure book.  I read it and fell in love.  Two years later, Field of Dreams was released and it was based on Shoeless Joe by this Kinsella fellow.  And I feel in love with that movie too.  Life moved on and I never read the book, Shoeless Joe.  I read a few Kinsella stories, but never had the chance to read his only other novel.  THen, I was finally drawn to the book.  Perhaps it was the 15th anniversary of &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot;  Nevertheless, I read Shoeless Joe in a single day (and what a pleasure it was).  The book is indeed different from the movie.  And that makes it a pleasure.  The movie stays close to the spirit of the book, and works beautifully as a motion picture.  The book is deeper, sweeter, and more magical.  J.D. Salinger, Ray's twin brother, and others populate the cast.  Annie is sweeter and more dreamy than in the Amy Madigan's protrayal.  Enough about the film though.  This is a story about life, love, dreams, and baseball (although baseball is indeed all of those things).  It is, as Salinger says,the one constant in our lives.  The books explores Ray's mania a bit more.  The magic of Kinsella will touch anyone who reads the book.  While I'm sorry I took so long to read it, I'm sure as heck glad I did.  I read somewhere that Kinsella is no longer writing.  I respect that of course, but we sure as hell miss him.	2004-07-02

That isn't CO Also, it was nice not have a doctor as the leader character--instead we get a strong woman.  The story is indeed engrossing and I read it in one day.  However, toward the end, the twists are dizzying and, while satisfying, I had to read a few paragraphs twice to follow along.  There are the usual great characters, suprises, but was it too much?  And why all the typos?  Seriously, don't they have editors?  Still, well worth a read.  Coben is still better than the vast majority of folks out there today.	2004-06-30

This novel is populated with fewer strange characters than &quot;Flinch&quot; and is a less personal story (I guess any story where you suspect your brother of being a serial keller is personal as in Flinch)...yet it works.  The murder mysteries here take some great turns.  Jimmy is far more settled in this book and seems happier.  I was sad to see Jane Holt and Desmond relgated to smaller roles.  Same with Rollo, although he was around.  This was much more about the case and less about these wonderful characters.  Still, the mystery is a dandy and Hollywood again is shown to be a place of murder and redemption.	2004-06-29

It is not exactly Ulysses, but made me laugh outloud several times.  Sure, there are flaws here, but the characters--particularly the Band (a PC lovers dream) and his grandfather (hilarious).  His brother, King, was complete underdeveloped (for example, why does our hero see him in that bathroom in the building where the illegal business was going down? It was never mentioned again).  The story about the father was just sad, but very effective.  I loved the Barry Manilow stuff...it was almost touching.  The main story was solid, but too long was spent on the trial and not enough &quot;cracking the case,&quot; the resolution did not seem all that well thought out.  Although, the big performance for MBM did work beautifully.  I have a few other issues...why was the father called &quot;S.&quot; (was a respect thing?), why is the cover photo taken in Chicago when the book is set in Oakland?  My biggest complaint and it is not a big deal, is that the book is so clearly set in Oakland, but the town has been renamed Santa Rita?  I have no idea and it was distracting.  Sounds like I didn't like the book, but really I did.  Gordy is a charming and the characters in the band really make the book worth it.  And the Manilow stuff is wacky and really cool.	2004-06-24

I have not read his dectective novels; only the amazing Mystic River (which was better than the movie btw).  So, perhaps I do not judge him quite the same as some other reviewers. Mystic River is a brillant study of friendship, responsibility and shattered dreams.  Although this novel has those same themes, Lehane approaches this book in a much different way.  It is spooky, atmospheric, and twisting. Even makes some interesting points about mental health treatment in America.  The story is excellent and the ending is indeed a shocker.  What I liked about it, besides being almost completely shocked (I figured out only one small part), was how it fit.  The book does not make an outrageous leap at the end and the ends are indeed tied up.  Honestly surprising book until the last sentence.  So few thrillers do that.  It was nice to read a surprising and frankly a scary novel that was not absurd.  It all works.  I admire Lehane's mind.  I just don't want to visit it anytime soon.	2004-06-23

I was generous because Siegel is a first time writer (although, strangely, the paperback has not a single biographical note on the author--but a preview of his next book is there).  This book was hyped to the skies they say, but I missed all of that.  Is an intriguing, if not completely new story.  Man cheats on wife.  Man pays price.  It was like a Bonfire of the Vanities--but more like the movie version than the book (which is, IMO a masterpiece).  Schine is a good enough guy, but one who is hard to love until the end.  His wife and daughter are more worthy of your care, but they are fairly two dimensional.  Still, many of the of twists were suprising, but not all.  One, toward the end (I won't say more) was so outlandish and so improbable, that I had really had to suspend my disbelief and it was very hard to do that.  On the other hand, I did read the book in one day so it was a page turner.  A good story...think a poor man's version of the movie Unfaithful with a wish to be like Bonfire.	2004-06-20

He is a wonderful writer and &quot;The Man who Ate the 747&quot; is one of my favorite books.  That spirit of wonder and love has not left the quill (I doubt he actually writes with a quill, but so what?).  Charlie St. Cloud is a tougher read in that it deals so openly with death, loss, and well, it is set in a cemetary.  I finished the book in tears (as usual with this writer) and cried a couple of other times.  I read the book in just two sittings.  Sherwood's style is deceptively simple (he does have an impressive vocabulary however).  What amazes is that this kind of story--with life, death, the afterlife, etc...is so deftly pulled off.  It largely avoids being maudolin or cliched.  It is something of a miracle that this story works so beautifully.  In the hands of someone else, it might not.  Sherwood is so upbeat about life and I wish more of us had his optimism and understanding.  His stories are very special.  This is the kind of book that you may read again and again, especially after a tragedy.  I loved Ferrio too and how he connects the main characters.<br />Another note, if you read the source notes and afterward, you learn more interesting things.  For example, as with &quot;747&quot; the locations in the book are real.  I love that.  It seems that this book will be made into a film and it will work--in the right hands.  Nevertheless, the book is almost always better right?  The acknowledgements are fascinating...if you are a media geek some names will pop out,a former head of NBC, a top screen writer, an entertainment journalist, and even the creator of Alias and Felicity.  This guy has some darned interesting friends.  My favorite?  The last lines about his family and his wife.  Their love story might make a great story too--if he hasn't already put in books.	2004-06-19

These books--thrillers, crime novels, whatever you want to the call genre--are often cliche ridden, filled with hollow characters and dialogue, and have all too neat endings.  Connelly avoids all of that.  He writes exceptionally well and the characters here are fleshed out and vivid.  I have not read any of the Harry BOsch novels; sticking only to COnnelly's stand alone works.  This is a very interesting story; with a compelling lead character.  Connelly writes Cassie as a strong, flawed, and very real woman.  Karch is a wonderful foil for her.  I wasn't thrilled with the use of the little girl in the climax, but suprising it avoids most cliches.  I particularly liked the subtle twists in the last 75 pages.  Connelly does not stretch his scenes.  He lets them stand on their own power.  Another strength...the last chapter.  It is not a &quot;neat&quot; ending, but a good one.  One note--beware how the publisher is trying to wring every last dollar out of you.  Try not to buy the &quot;trade&quot; paperback; the bigger and more expensive one.  IS it worth the extra 6 bucks?  I don't think so.  I hate when they are that transparent in their attempts to make money.  Oh, well.  That isn't Connelly's fault.	2004-06-18

A rarity indeed in the realm of Clinton literature is an honest and balanced review of the Clinton years.  It is not a deep review but a wonderful reconsideration of the Clinton years.  Klein is spot on in most of writing--from his accounts of the destruction of Newt Gingrich to the accounts of Clinton's self-destruction.  He hammers Clinton particularly hard for the Mark Rich pardon, which makes perfect sense in the context of who Clinton was.  Klein makes one very bizarre conclusion.  He blames Clinton for the current problems between Israel and the Palestinians.  It is unclear how the failed peace talks are really Clinton's fault (don't Barak, Sharon and, of course, the Arafat and his ilk, deserve the blame?).  Nevertheless, a rare book that is honest and tempered.  And it pulls no punches.  Fair and balanced.	2004-06-18

Pierre takes on the modern media machine, materialism, violence, sex and even the victimization (subtly and perhaps most daringly) that pervade modern America.  The book works on several levels, both as a fantastical story, a coming of age novel, and of course, this no holds barred satire.  YOu come to love Vern very easily, when if you just want to shake him and tell him to tell the truth (the novel would be about 20 pages if he did).  I really enjoyed the love/hate relationship that Vern has with his town and those in it.  The tragedy of the murders is never far away and Vern suffers.  Still, there are delights all over the novel.  I did not rate it five stars because I did feel like the first two parts were not as strong as the second half, but that is a small issue.  What I particularly enjoyed was solving the mystery of Vern's dad, which is only told through clues at the end.  No one is quite as they seem, at least those you love.	2004-06-15

This is my fifth John Douglas book, the first I've read with Stephen Singular.  Like many true crime books, it is not great literature.  The story feels stretched out for extra drama over too many pages and the books strays off into Douglas' discourse on cybercrime fighting it loses it's momentum.  The sections on cybercrime fighting should have been in the appendix.  John Douglas is a passionate crusader for both law enforcement and victim's rights, but he really was a snooze here--his knowledge of the internet is not very deep and the listing of government agencies is bland.  However, the John Robinson story was completely new to me.  He is truly a one of a kind serial killer...from white collar criminal to murderer is not the &quot;usual&quot; route.  I wonder if he is proud of being the first internet serial killer.  His wife Nancy is also a tragic, yet frightening woman.  How could she not know?  Or more likely, how could she deny, deny, deny his nature?  Wow.  However, the focus should remain on the monsterous deeds of JR.  He again shows us the banality of evil.  Not great literature, but a fascinating case that I had never even heard of until I read this book.	2004-06-14

I do not get to read Mr. Kennedy's columns as I don't subscribe to the Times or read it online enough.  However, I might well check out his column weekly from now on.  The book is a delight.  It is fascinating account of the hidden history of a city.  I think New Yorkers or ex-New Yorkers will love this book the most, but even as someone who ridden the subways as tourist, I can revel in his prose and tales.  It reminds a bit of Joe Gould.  Fine writing and his love the people shines through.	2004-06-11

Anyway, this is fascinating, intense, and loooooooonnnnnggggggg book.  Nevertheless, I argue it is more entertaining than American Tabloid.  Maybe it is because the stakes are higher and the characters are already known to us (except Wayne).  Where Tabloid succeeded with smaller stories that became bigger, these stakes are huge from the beginning.  You weirdly fall in love with Ellroy's flawed heroes: Wayne, Pete (the coolest killer ever), and Ward (who remains hard to love)...you watch their lives unfold and unfurl.  Hoover is back and again knows all.  Ellroy's plot could be seen as outlandish, but somehow each and every piece works (unlike some of the guns in the book).  It is brillant.  It is absoring.  It is Ellroy.	2004-06-07

Ok, maybe this book isn't comedic by nature, but some of it is laugh out loud funny.  I don't mean that that is laughably bad, I mean that some of Lankford's dialogue is just that good.  The may not be strikingly original but I will say that the story flys by and really hits the film industry in the solar plexus.  The characters are solid and Clyde McCoy has some superior lines.  His analysis of the fall of Hollywood (actually of his own career) is not only on the mark, but more geniunely heartbreaking than any of the deaths in the book.  The character of Charity is meant to represent a type and it does that, but she isn't someone you naturally want to cheer for.  I guess Hollywood does that you.  And, the end was just great.  Very much like an old movie.  You can't beat it.	2004-06-01

After reading the reviews of Detective COnlon's book, I was very excited to read it.  It was promised an inside look at life as a cop and I love book about crime, criminals, and the everyday heroes who pursue them.  This book was far too long.  While it follows a general chronological narrative, the stories meander and jump between family history, city history, and present day without much warning.  Even worse, the stories about cases and informants tend to shift midstream.  It was also very hard to keep people straight--an index might have helped.  Some parts seemed endless.  However, other parts, particularly the last 100 pages about 9/11 and Ed's rise to detective are far more involving.  I wonder if perhaps the mismash of styles was designed to frustrate, much as the Job has frustated Conlon.  These men are almost all heroes and Conlon shows the day to day to frustrations better than any book I've read about policing.  However, it could have been about 200 pages shorter.	2004-05-29

It was a book I ended up liking a great deal.  First it is very, very funny.  Lots of great references to the '70s, '80s, '90s, and 2001.  He knows he is like Nick Hornby is mocks himself for it.  Tom works at a thinly veiled NY Post.  THe characters are really funny.  Tom wants us to think he is unattractive, but he sure knows a lot of women and dates even more.  However, he is madly in love with Julia.  Julia is tough to fall in love with--I couple of times I was hoping she would be hit by a bus.  But, as we must with friends, we support TOm in his love anyway.  I think Smith wanted this to be heartwrenching and a few times it succeeds.  It is very honest about men and loving the wrong woman.  But, seriously dude, Julia is not that great.  The 9/11 &quot;change&quot; is not cliched--he handles it really well--with respect but also with the kind of exhaustion that many NYers felt.  It is not Nick Hornby circa High Fidelity, but it beat Nick Hornby in his last book.  Smith writes a book that is better than many of the Hornby imitators, but not better than the master at his best.  IF that makes any sense.  I must sound wishy washy.  That is sort of how I feel (like Tom).  Good stuff, but not National Book Award stuff.	2004-05-14

Any veteran fan who is not a stat-head, will not agree with everything written in here.  However, it is fascinating to consider.  Beane is no hero, but certainly a hell of a GM.  I'm fascinated to see how DePodesta does in LA with a bigger payroll.  The book is at it's best when describes the stories of the players--Scott Hatteberg, Jeremy Brown and the trades (the chapter on Rincon is classic).  It slows down when Lewis falls too much into his financial/math background.  Still, anything that challenges the prevailing wisdom (I particularly loved the scene where Beane goes nuts on Art Howe for the lefty-Lefty, righty-righty bullpen match ups--it is one my own pet peeves) is worth 5 stars.  Guys like Bill James get their just due.  Overall, it is a fanastic read.  Besides, anything that upsets that blowhard Joe Morgan this much MUST BE GENIUS!	2004-05-10

James Ellroy, after only 3 books, has taken his place among my most favorite writers.  Ellroy's collection of fiction and non-ficiton is a mixed bag, but mostly excellent.  The best essay is \\"Let's Twist Again,\\" a return to his junior high days.  I expected something more elegiac and less upbeat, but the change of tone suits the peace.  In fact, it is one of the best pieces I have ever read about those forgotten Jr. High years.  Frankly, the weakest piece is the Sinatra crime story--TiJuana, Mon Amour.  There was nothing much new it in it and the other long short stories, esp. the Dick Contino piece were better.  Danny Getchell as a narrator is better in short bursts.  There are more mediations on his mother's murder, but even if you have read \\"My Dark Places\\" they add a bit of perspective.  I loved his piece on the LA Confidential movie/Curtis Hanson, the piece of the Sheriff's Homicide Department, and the OJ Simpson story.  As an avowed OJ junkie, I love to read anything new on it.  Perhaps not his strongest work, but certainly worth a read if you enjoy his work.  Sadly, the introduction is written by the late Art Cooper of GQ, who many of us still miss.	2004-04-26

It is certainly not a happy one, but one, that I think is honest.  I'm sure many of the readers were touched by the character of the narrator, Joan Castleman.  I was not touched, but certainly felt sympathy toward her and her anger.  Perhaps because I am a man.  Perhaps because I am not yet married.  Perhaps because I am not in my golden yers, this book did not resonate fully with me.  However, I was involved in the story and fascinated by Wolitzer's fully drawn characters.  Her sly jabs at the publishing world were a bonus.  Reviewers have discussed the &quot;shocking&quot; ending, but honestly I figured out the twist fairly early on.  I didn't want to believe it perhaps, but when it was revealed I was not that surprised.  What happens after the reveal was a bit surprising, but it all works.  This is a good and honest novel and I'm glad I exposed myself to a different voice.  An important one at that.	2004-04-10

The Dodgers of Brooklyn are now mythic.  After one reads a wonderful book like Boys of Summer and hears stories about the Bums, you can't help but believe it.  However, the Last Good Season brings some balance to the stories and memories.  He honors the men who played a boys game in a decaying old stadium.  He does not villify O'Malley, but does Robert Moses who was not a great force for good.  The book is not a pure baseball book, but as a self-styled historian (using the term very loosely), I enjoyed the views of the Brooklyn and the large social change.  Shapiro does not make the Dodgers more than they are.  If anything, he is understated in his discussions of the power of baseball.  It works beautifully.  The book is engrossing and by the end, you can't help but the love Dodgers more.  Once you have read this (and you must read Boys of Summer first) go read The Sandy Koufax book, A Lefty's Legacy which really is a nice a bookend to the Dodgers glory years of the 1950s and 1960s (to say nothing of the '70s and '80s).	2004-04-08

How appropriate huh?  Still, that doesn't tell you anything about the book.  This story is basically a romantic fable.  It is filled with warmth, wonder, and whismy.  It is impossible to not fall in love with characters--the ones in the background, Shrimp, Early Wyatt, and others are wonderful--are so honest.  One cool touch, the town and all the records are real--the characters aren't, but it adds another dimension to this book.  It will reaffirm your belief in true love, even if you don't have it.  It is about hope.  It is a simple, quick read (I read it in one sitting), but I miss it already.  I want to go back and visit with Willa and JJ and the whole town.  The truth?

I was not a big fan of Line of Vision, but will say that I liked Ellis enough (perhaps because I love Chicago authors, being a chicagoan myself) to read this book.  It was rewarding.  Ellis has grown a great deal.  The idea of a man wrongly accused is the same as is the unnamed town that seems a lot like Chicago (why not just make it Chicago, or like Turow name it something?)...however, the plot is far better.  A bit far fetched (but most of these are) and the plot moves along well.  A true courtroom thriller.  I did not figure out the ending and was very surprised (and pleased since it was true shock) by it.  It was worth the money.  The story could break in any direction and that keeps it fun.  A good story, good moral tone, and good characters.  I just read a negative review of Ellis' 3rd book, but I bet I will read it down the line.	2004-03-24

I don't have much new to add to these other well done reviews.  This is very interesting and not often discussed period of history.  The characters are vivid and Beschloss writes quite well.  We learn about the incredible divisions in FDR's cabinet and you can't help but think of the Bush war cabinet.  While not setting the world on fire, this book is a piece of excellent history.  I would have liked more on Truman and his struggles in his early days, but overall the book is fair, interesting, and taught me many things.	2004-03-23

And search for love (of all kinds).  A rip roaring detective yarn.  Ellroy's writing is like Hemingway on crack...he searches for the killer of his mother and tries to find her (and his) soul in the process.  Many of the reviews here do justice this extraordinary book.  It moved me.  It scared me.  It fascinated me.  Crime to Ellroy is lifeblood.  We see where it all began.  He is one of the great America writers.	2004-03-22

Sure, the characters are sleazy, people are killed, etc, but behind the whole thing the author was clearly enjoying himself.  I enjoyed it more than most Grishman novels.  In fact, one could argue that the entire book is a meditation, a condemnation, a spoof of national politics--but I doubt that the intention...maybe it was.  Anyway, it is a fun ride that is not typical Grisham--which is a good thing.  One thing that is very spooky, is that book was written in 2000...Grisham had the threat of terrorism to the United States nailed perfectly.  I wonder if he thought of this book on 9/11.  Oh well.  Good read.	2004-03-19

She is fascinating woman who might have benefitted from a bit of therapy.  Instead, she wrote this book.  She tells a tale of dancers, but more a tale of her search for herself.  She falls in love with a missing tooth cowboy and decides to strip across america.  She is disarmingly honest and sensitive.  She knows she works in an industry that is not perfect, honest, or warm.  She tells it as she sees it.  Her book is part memoir, part oral history,part expose, and a journey home.  My only complaint is that she spent too much using her thesaurus in an attempt to prove she is smart.  We know she is.  Her writing is terrific, fresh, and her honesty is illuminating.	2004-03-18

I really liked Amanda and Frank Jaffe.  They are sympathic leads.  However, book tries to be a serious and complex mystery, but I figured it out well before the end.  In fact, some of my questions about the murderer were not answers.  I don't want to ruin the book and put my questions here, but I still don't quite understand the frame-ups.  Why?   The dialogue here is a bit too wooden and the plot too bizarre.	2004-03-17

I love Joe Queenan's books, this the fourth of his that I have read.  He is usually hilarious and always on the mark.  This book lacks (and that is not a bad thing) has usual trademark razor wit that causes bleeding when touched.  However, he goes after fair weather fans and Yankee fans quite well.  With the exception the extended chapter on Notre Dame (I still hate Notre Dame and can't enjoy even Queenan's wise commentary), the book is terrific.  Parts are moving.  Queenan's life, as many of ours have, been shaped by sports.  Friendships, family, etc.  The book is funny; but it also honest and a bit moving.  The end, taking place at Wrigley Field (of course) may move you to tears.  Great stuff.	2004-03-15

If you wish to know about Rudy's life before 1989, his first marriage, childhood, days as U.S. attorney, this is not the right book for you.  The first 100 pages or so this book are a bit slow--too much campaign stuff and not enough on governing.  However, the narrative picks up quickly over the last 200 pages.  We learn about Rudy's mistakes and triumphs--of which there are many.  You learn a ton about Rudy's controversial policies.  The personal scandals are discussed, but not in a malicious way.  We never learn about the details of his mysterious marriage to Donna Hanover--or anything much about Hanover.  So, yes, things are left out.  However, Al Sharpton is a fascinating character here.  You learn about Rudy's day on Sept. 11, when the author was actually running around the city with the Mayor. The narrative ends in 2001.  I would have loved to hear more about Bloomberg, but who can change the publication date now?  It isn't perfect, but Rudy remains one of the fascinating--and successful--Mayors of our time.	2004-03-14

It is rich in Hollywood lore and names (yes, you need a knowledge of Hollywood history at some parts--but that is nice to see--an author who rewards her readers and doesn't dumb down her book).  The book is loaded with red herrings and odd characters.  I liked all of it and knocked out in two days.  The story was original and very film noir.  Still, the ending puzzled the heck out of me.  Happy?  Sad?  What in the world?  A sequel?  Got me.  I think I sort of figured something out, but frankly even with the \\"leave ya hanging\\" end, the book is much better than the average genre junk out there.  Finally, I did read on interview with Knode where she promises a sequel.  She also discusses how much of a feminist book this was.  I missed that, but still liked the book a great deal.	2004-03-10

Westlake has some funny moments in this book, but I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.  The premise is intriguing and the plot absurd.  Often times, these capers can be fun, but not here.  There is little character development and the plot is not even intriguing.  The writing is simple and fast, but I did not really care what happened.  I was bored by parts and glad to see it end.

Parts of the book read like a recap from his specials--the chapter on Greed is almost verbatim from his special &quot;Greed.&quot;  Nevertheless, he is a fascinating and entertaining read.  Some of his ideas are a bit too simplisitic.  Others are dead on.  He smashes the left--as they had done to him.  I was disappointed that he did not take on the right more often.  He disagreed with them on many points--particularly social policy--but does not slam the Bennetts, the Limbaughs, etc.  That is probably because he needs some allies (and Ralph Nader is not his friend any longer, but it was a bit disengenous.  Nevertheless, the book is thought provoking.  I, for one, am glad he is on my TV every week.  We need his voice, even if it it too often is a lone one in the wilderness.	2004-02-29

I can't tell you how much I laughed and could not put it down.  I love Jack Flynn, who has quickly become one of my favorite literary heroes.  I don't generally read book after book with one character, but Flynn is indeed the exception.  He is charming, honest (to a fault?), and funny.  McGrory even makes me feel deeply for Baker the dog and I've never owned a dog.  Yet, the parts of the book that deal with Baker made me understand the love that dog owners have in a way that all the people I know in real life who have dogs never got me to see.  Even more, the plot is more restrained.  The first book, a good read, was too outlandish.  This book was more believable.  We spend a lot of time in Jack's pysche as he finally wrestles with his pain.  The pain was honest and sad.  My only complaint is that Jack spends too much time beating himself up over Hilary Kane (too much).  However, the secondary characters are great.  Mongillo, Martin, etc.  I like the way he handled the relationship with Riggs as well.  McGrory is growing and I can't wait for the next book...will be before the Sox win a World Series?  Probably...	2004-02-24

However, it is impossible not to like Dr. Marc Seidman.  The book's plot is a bit convoluted--but not so crazy that you want to scream like Gone for Good (which oddly I still enjoyed). It was fun to see the return of Joe Pistillo, if even for a moment.  The characters in here were nicely drawn.  The themes of love, family, loss and the choices we resonate.  It is good read and not an easy (as in neat and clean) end.  Might be Coben's best to date.	2004-02-18

Lerner's book is outrageous in many ways--hilarious, scary, honest, and bit unbelieveable (sort of the way Tim O'Brien talks about how you can never tell a &quot;true&quot; war story).  Lerner, a Jewish MBA who suddenly finds himself in prison (according to his version of events, a sentence he probably did not deserve, but that is up to the reader) for a manslaughter charge.  The book is filled with colorful characters with surprising humanity.  Lerner is no saint and he knows it.  An alcoholic who makes astonishingly bad choices, he cops to his mistakes.  His stories and details about prison life are remarkable.  Not surprisingly there is a sadistic guard and heroic prisoners...but Lerners sees them for who they are and finds his salvation in a powerful and raucuous closing.  He also has savage things to say about corporate culture (his cubicle neighbor, Scott Adams of Dilbert fame, might agree) and the comparisons to prison are, while not original, still eye opening.  The structure of the book is a bit odd--the details of his crime are left to the end--but it all manages to work.  Thanks, Dawg.	2004-02-16

If the first Pender book was by turns revolting, scary, and creepy...this one tries to be, but has a lighter tone.  Pender is great fun (I wish we had more of Sid, the wise cracking, dapper best friend to Ed), but we don't get even get as much of him.  Linda is a decent character, who is not fleshed out.  We get a lot of Simon Childs (not real clever with that name, but oh well), who is fascinating in theory, but only fairly interesting in reality.  I would have liked more Pender.  The book is good in that it does not dwell too long on any one chase (as the last book did at times).  The last one worked for pure scare factor, this was more fun, but there are many better thrillers out there.  Oh, and why is Nasaw always trying to show us that he must have scored well on his Verbal SATs?  I wonder what he is trying to overcompensate for.    Still, I'd welcome another Pender novel, but I hope he enjoys his retirement first.	2004-02-09

I was curious to read this, his first book, a memoir of his real days in country.  It is without the lyrical beauty and power of some of his other fictionalized accounts of war, but as he says in How to Tell a True War Story--what exactly is real in war?  This is as close one can come...a fascinating account--perhaps most interesting is the down time--the mundane aspects of war.  His honesty is disarming (no pun intended), but the polished O'Brien we know and love is still developing.  It is an important book and worth the time spent.	2004-02-05

I read the Millionaires first, which despite it's absurd ending, I enjoyed.  I read First Counsel(which honestly did not stay very long in my mind) and The Tenth Justice next (have not read Dead Even) and it was clear that Meltzer had a ways to go--good ideas, some sloppy execution...however, if you line up the books in the order they written, he has grown.  This was a really interesting and original story.  The best part of the book is the &quot;game&quot; (hilarious and ingenious) and the inside look at Congress (his research is outstanding).  The characters, Matthew, Viv, and Harris are among his best.  It is cool see a multicultural cast of characters.  The problem?  Well, the biggest was the fact that the two chase scenes are FAR too long.  He had this problem in other books, but these went on and on.  It would have been better to hear more about the Midas Project (I need to be vague so as not to ruin the book) and the political stories behind it.  I would have enjoyed more character driven issues and less running around.  And, as another reviewer so smartly noted, the dust jacket gets many things wrong--particularly Viv's age--which  is 17, not 16.  I must commend Meltzer on his restraint in plot twists--there is a whopper early on--but he uses them wisely--another sign of growth.  I hear he has recently moved to Florida.  I hope he does not lose his ear for the political or urban thriller.	2004-02-02

Wags is character alright and fundamentally decent, if a bit flawed, man.  His story reads like a novel or comedic film.  I'm not quite sure where the truth was stretched, but his honest delivery is well worth the (very fast) read.

This book filled me in on what I missed and what a story it is.  A fascinating story, filled with absorbing and tragic characters.  I thought the book, while well researched, was not well written.  The structure is a bit sloppy and some the stories that appear as interludes are only tangentially related (like someone who knew someone who vaguely remembered Neulander in the '60s).  I might have chosen a more straight forward narrative, but oh well...the story carries the day.  And finally, justice.	2004-01-25

I am not in my 50s, so I can't judge how real this book is, however, the longing, hope, and passion that these people are looking for or have, is universal.  O'Brien continues to move away from fiction that strictly Vietnam and succeeds wonderfully.  The book flows and moves along and you are taken along.  I cared for these people.

Well, Hmm...I just finished this novel and I'm not sure what I thought.  I didn't like a lot, but I certainly didn't dislike it.  This was nowhere near as bad as Shampoo Planet (which Coupland himself admits was not a winner).  However, the spiritual elements that worked so well in Girlfriend in Coma (which this reminded of at times) and Life After God (I book I loved) are the main focus here, but they don't always work.  The story is interesting and the format highly couplandesque.  I admired the characters' ability to try and understand and change, but something was missing for me.  Perhaps I did not connect to these people (also something of an issue in his last novel, All Families...but that at least was one big lark).  Anyway, lots of people have loved this book.

I often hestiate to buy a novel in hard cover (one might call me budget conscious? ) that is this short--however, it worth it.  I read the book in just a few hours, but it will stay with me for a long time.  Daniel is a wonderful, warm, and slightly sad character.  I loved the first person narration.  Daniel is obsessive-complusive and Martin nails down his inner life.  His hilarious attempts at romance, his nutty essay, his road trips are all spiced with humor and a twinge of realism.  Martin's writing is warm and honest.  The ending is so wonderful, it might move you to tears (I will say no more so as not to ruin it).  I was quite impressed by a modern man who works to solve his own problems instead of blaming others (his attempts at therapy are also humorous).  Martin dispels, intentionally or not, so much of our addiction based culture.  Daniel learns strength and tries to conquer the world on his own terms--with a quiet heart.  A beautiful little story.  Martin is fantastic.	2003-12-24

He is not even a nice guy.  He IS however hilariously self-aware.  If this book were fiction, you might think it was simply absurd.  However, it is all true as Young tells us in the end.  I have admit, despite the many negative reviews, that I enjoyed this book.  Young's complete inability to be anything but honest about himself and his failings is winning.  I sat there in pain several times (who hires a stripper on take your daughter to work day?!) and especially as he discussed how he won his wife's heart.  Many of things he says about New York and our American society are dead on.  Somethings are may not be so cut and dry.  However, his Oxford background shows as he analyzes our culture using sources ranging from TS Eliot to Gore Vidal to Tina Brown to Byron (and lest we not forget Ben Hecht who is quoted every 10 pages!).  Not perfect, not always nice, but honest.  YOu don't get that so much these days.  And congrats Young, whatever you are doing now.	2003-12-20

It has been a looooong time since I last read Turow (One L), but this was too good to pass up.  My only fear was that it would be too preachy in regards to the errors that the system makes (Turow has spoken and written at length about his objections to the system).  Instead, the book is even handed and focuses on the story.  The plot can be a bit convoluted--but the strength of the book lies in its complex (and in Gillian's case incredibly complex) characters.  Arthur, Gillian, Collins, Erno, Muriel, and Larry all have made &quot;reversible errors&quot; and Turow takes the time to look at all of them.  John Grisham can't hope to ever write this well.  Turow is worth the time.	2003-12-14

I love crime novels, but not usually the series novels (the Harry Bosch series)...that is not to say those books are bad...far from it...however, I just don't have the patience to catch up and read all those books at once.  That said, it is always interesting to read stand alone novels by writers who have done excellent work in their series.  Chasing the Dime, by Connelly, was smart and original.  This book, which even though it is only 7 years old, is a bit dated (in terms of technology).  Still, it is good solid crime thriller and gets many of the FBI details down cold.  McEvoy is not a lovable guy, but a flawed and interesting leading man.  The book proceeds well but the ending is a bit odd--a bit bizarre...I twist and red herring after twist after twist was tooo much.  Still, well crafted and better than many other books in this genre.	2003-12-02

There are some great ideas here, but it could have been short.  Furthermore, there is just too much graphic sex in this book--soft porn almost.  Why is that needed?  I'm not sure what it adds to the story, even if it about people discovering who they are...I'm pretty open minded, but I really think it distracts from a fascinating story.  Block loves NY and is to be commended for that.	2003-11-18

It reminds, I know, I know, of early Hornby, if a bit more sappy.  Keeble, however, has his own voice and explores a terrain rarely seen in today's popular fiction--brothers.  The relationship between Jes and Scott is very real.  The book is universal and it could easily have been set in New Orleans or Dallas as London.  The penguin subplot is funny and makes sense in the context of the story.  The losses that Scott feels are very real and the redemption he finds is poignant.  The book is a breezy but moving read.	2003-11-05

Savage is simply awesome.  This book makes more sense than any political tome I have read in ages.  Savage is honest and completely without pretense.  He savages the right wing which only approves of sins they like and not those which make them uncomfortable. Highlights of the book include the chapter on New York (where he hires boyfriend and girlfriend escorts), the Pot chapter, and the gay pride parade chapter.  Savage hates guns, but learns to enjoy shooting his gun.   He is so honest that you can't help but respect him.  He is even stronger here than in his column, if you can believe it.

There is a place for violence in crime novels certainly (and in the true crime genre).  However, I'm very disturbed by this book.  I usually have a tough stomach for this kind of thing, but parts of were so vivid that I wondered if they were really needed for the story.  In fact, the violence overshadows the book.  I had hoped the characters would shine through and that the story would make the violence secondary.  Instead, it is a bit of odd end and the characters are soaked in blood.  A bit much for me.

I've been a big fan of Vowell's since her extraordinary obit for Frank Sinatra in 1999 on Salon.com.  Her last book of essays was wonderfully eclectic.  This one is a bit less personal and more about history and America itself.  Vowell shone in her autobiographical essays in Take the Cannoli.  Here, she has very few missteps (the Tom Cruise essay was not something I fully got), but her Gettysburg address essay is outstanding.  She is full of liberal politics, but also is NEVER predictable.  She loves her country and writes movingly of her place in it.  She is one of Generation X's finest spokespeople.

The book is longer than the first in the series and perhaps a bit better.  The plot avoids some of the aburdist elements of the first.  The book is paced well and Flynn remains a charmer.  It was nice to see how he has grown in life.  I was surprised to see that the FBI love interest from the first book was not even mentioned here.  What happened to her?  Elizabeth Riggs is far better character, but still...I was glad my favorite fictional golden retriever Baker was back.  It was great to meet Hank Sweeney too.  McGrory's work is at times light and funny--Flynn is a great alter ego.  The bigger mystery is still a bit nutty and unrealistic, but fascinating all the rest.  I'll be back for my third Flynn book soon.	2003-09-18

Blauner's novel has some great touches about modern day life, particularly in the shadow of 9/11 (I finished it the day before the 2 year anniversary so the memories are still heavy) and the characters are often sympathetic (I particularly enjoyed Harold, Paco, and Barry).  Blauner creates a geniunely creepy Mike for most of the book.  However, I found the ending chapters to be like one of those action picture endings--who lives and dies (I shall not reveal) seems to be driven by drama and not realism.  It is a good book, but I don't share the love of it that many readers here seem to have.	2003-09-10

I read this book after finishing Grisham's Summons (not exactly the same genre, but close) and Lehane's extraordinary Mystic River.  This far exceeds Grisham and falls in behind Lehane's novel.  As many novels in this genre, it requires a willing suspension of disbelief. The end is a bit too hollywood perhaps and the case comes together in a way that fits all too well.  However, I did not figure out until the character did.  It was an intriguing mystery and the science was fascinating.  Connelly is good writer and I will certainly read more of his non-Harry Bosch novels (to take nothing away from his Harry books, I just haven't the time to start the series now).  This is far better than most of the genre stuff that sells.  Kudos to Mr. Connelly.	2003-09-03

It was a decent, if not fully satisfying conclusion.  I most interested in the King of Torts character...who more interesting than anyone else.  I've stayed away from Grisham for a long time since I wasn't enjoying his work anymore, but this medicore.  Not a waste to read at all, just not great.

After reading the reviews on ..., this book seemed like a slam dunk...a great political thriller.  It was anything but.  My first warning sign should have been \\"a novel in the tradition of Vince Flynn.\\"  I don't like Mr. Flynn's work and Mr. Ellis follows in the tradition of overblown plots, fairly weak dialogue, and no character development.  This might work for a major motion picture, but for 400 pages it is absurd.  There is little to like in the characters, but then again we don't get to know them at all.  The story flies along in short bits and nothing seems real.  A media consultant hero is a stretch to begin with, but who knows it might have worked.  Instead, we get absurd ideas, weak characters, and convoluted stories.  Yikes.	2003-08-19

I'm not sure that is a boldly original as some reviewers claim, but that isn't a big deal.  The book is a classic noir--a book noir? rather than a film--with a fine, if somewhat vague femme fatale.  There are twists--and they are good ones indeed--but they don't strain the limits of credibilty.  Let me rephrase that your honor, they strain, but don't break into the realm of the absurd as so many of these novels can do.  Kalish is not always a good man, however he has some darkness in him that we can understand (even if don't buy it--ask Adrian.  Some readers have complained that vital information was kept from us until the end.  I liked that, it was a good mystery.  Still, I felt like the book started slowly and was a bit too long.  It could have been edited down a bit.  One more complaint, why didn't Ellis set this anywhere?  The unnamed &quot;downtown&quot; is Chicago--just thinly disguised.  Maybe the lack of a real location was supposed to make this more universal.  What really got me was the fear of Kalish and the isolation he felt.  Remind me never to go on trial.

It is an wonderfully written tale that avoids cliches and the often [ironic] plot twists that populate the lesser novels in this genre.  The characters are sharply drawn, although none more than Judge Devine.  He is arrogant at times and burning with pain over the loss of his wife.  The details of Chicago (and I say this as a Chicagoan through and through) are pitch perfect.  The heist is complex.  I like how much of the story deals with the fall out of the heist.  It is not the type of story that ends with the main characters, tanned, rested, and toasting each other on board a yacht somewhere outside the US.  Finding happiness and moral guidance is not easy for the characters--it is complex story.  Zagel writes extremely well and I look forward to another book, should he desire to write one.	2003-08-11

Parts of this true crime book were terrific.  Particularly the parts about the investigation and the narrative about the life of the Fitzhugh family.  However, the last part of the book is a snooze.  Smith, who seems to have a talented background, basically gives us trial transcripts for about 100 pages or so, including the DNA evidence.  The narrative disappears and is enough to put me to sleep (as it did a few times).  The story here could have been told in much more engaging way--transcripts are not that interesting.  Also, where was the epilogue?  What happened?  We know Fitzhugh is convicted, but what about his kids?  Bob Brown?  What happened to these people?  We don't know.  Instead, we get some dime story philosophy and a look at Del Mar.  Who Cares?  There was a much better book to be written on this fascinating case.	2003-08-09

It is easy enough to be read in one sitting.  However, I would recommend taking your time--like the summer idylls he describes in the book.  The prose is easy going, but at times it is beautiful.  Talking about writing his memories of childhood Cohen says, &quot;On the page these memories becamne stories.  In this way, they were preserved and destroyed, taken from my mind and fixed in place.  Never again could they haunt me in quite the same way.&quot;  Indeed, this what the book partially does for Rich Cohen.  It is also about friendships and in reading about them, I could hear the songs of Harry Chapin.  That was music I listened to with my friends from the North Shore (although I was a city boy) about a half decade after Cohen left town.  He is lyrical about growing up.  He is also honest.  He captures the essence of leaving behind your childhood.  He never claims that things happened exactly as he puts them down on the page--there are no claims of objective truth.  He writes beautifully of his own memories and in that he transcends the facts.  His growing up was different than some readers (drugs, etc), but it makes the feelings no less universal.  I hesitate to make the comparison of Cohen's book to some of Bob Greene's work.  Greene's work is about a different generation that is often remembered by it's own members.  Greene tends to remember things in an innocent, nostalgic way, whereas Cohen has a harder edge honesty about his work--a raw quality that fits his persona.  However, what strikes me about both Chicago writers is that they both love the world that created them.  They honor memories.  There is much to be said for that.  Cohen is giving voice to Generation X in a way that few writers have (it is about time someone wrote about us in this way).  He is normal kid who is not confessing about his prozac nation, some sad abuse, or any of the other shocking claims of memoirs of Gen X.  Cohen loves his friends.  His friendships were filled with hope, love, and dreams.  Jaime may be a lot like Ferris Bueller, but I think he was real.  So is Cohen and so are his memories.	2003-08-06

The characters are not nearly as lovable as some of his others have been.  The story of Michael and his father is really cliched.

It is an honor to the be first to review this book on Amazon.  This book is not exactly genius, but then again maybe it is.  I can't tell what genius is anymore, but this is a kind of genius.  Forget the review of the book that appears above from Publisher's Weekly (ok, not completely--they are right that Chuck shines when he is telling personal stories, but they say it is only half a good book).  I throughly enjoyed Fargo Rock City and I loved this book of \\"low culture\\" essays.  Of course, I probably loved it a great deal because I share some of Chuck's love for the minute cultural details of Gen X and the 1980s.  His essay on Billy Joel is actually extraordinary.  I love Billy Joel and constantly have to deal with people who tell me what a hack he is.  Part of the joy of Chuck is that he revels in things people don't \\"respect\\" (he would say this with air quotes) and respects them because they are meaningful to him.  His Saved by the Bell broders on the brillant.  Perhaps the best essay in the entire book is the first one, \\"This is Emo\\" about how he will never fall in love because of all the \\"fake love\\" that movies have taught us to expect.  He has some wild thoughts, but truly believes in what he says.  He is not mean spirited either.  He is honest and that rings true.  The pop references are awesome of course.  Are all the essays perfect?  No, but even the weaker ones (the extended riff on alt-country music left me clueless) are often saved by strong passages that hit home.  I put Chuck on par with my favorite essayists--Joe Queenan (this book is sort of the anti-Red Lobster, Blue Lagoon) and Sarah Vowell.  However, Chuck is a voice all his own.  He is the only rock critic I have ever respected.  Trust me, that says a ton.  Moreover, read the book.  It is worth the price to hear an extraordinary voice of a generation.	2003-08-01

I enjoyed the Millionaires a good deal.  This one?  Not so much.  True, it was first novel, but the last 1/4 of the book is a mess.  Most of the story is interesting and the friendship angle is interesting.  The dialogue is funny and often true to life (of young adults).  The Supreme Court stuff is nice and interesting.  Even the set-up and red herrings are interesting.  I read most the book in one day to find out what would happen in the end.  The book barrels out of control in the end and seems to include everything possible, even when it borders on the absurd.  You can see it as a 2 star hollywood film--indeed, Meltzer even thanks Dick Clark (??) films in the acknowledgements.  Also contained in that section we see that many of the names in the book are those of friends--nice touch.  Basically, you can see the beginnings of Meltzer's strengths as a writer, but back in '97 he still had aways to go.  Read something else by him first.	2003-07-30

While I still hold Truman first in my heart, this book is an extraordinary achievement.  McCullough writes with the nimble pen of a great novelist and achieves the grand sweep of history.  He truly loves and respects Adams, but discusses honestly his mistakes.  Adams deserves a more honored place in our history.  This book is fine start.  Adams, especially as he protrayed in his old age, was an old lion.  His love for his wife and his country were and are unsurpassed.  This book was engrossing, extraordinary and simply incredible. Should be required reading for anyone who loves America.	2003-07-29

There are bits of Hollywood, esp. in the way the climax unfolds (and a strange flashback that is all too Apocalypse Now), but it works.  It is enrossing.  I loved The Hitman novels and this far more dramatic.  Tokyo comes alive and cultural life is fascinating.  Eisler scores with a quick and very tight story.	2003-07-22

I'm not sure I can add anyting new (as of this writing there are already 3500 reviews and the book has been out scarely a month)...but this is the best of the all books.  Of course, I've thought that after each new book, but really this it.  People talk of the dark tone, but it is realistic.  It captures the feelings of being 15 quite well.  The anger, the sadness, the hope, it all feels, well, real...At it's core, these books are about emotions and few authors convey them better than Rowling.  I dare say she is brillant.  This book is big alright-- I read 600 pages in one day just to finish it- yet I loved it so much.  Rowlings twists and turns are as good as the finest thriller writers and her wit never leaves her.  Her names are ingenious, her spells, oh it is all amazing.  I loved this book and it made me feel so much.  You will laugh and perhaps you will cry.  My review is cliche, but this book deserves to read and loved.  My only problem is that there are only two more books...this one was worth the wait.  Thank you JK.  You are deservedly the richest woman in the UK, you have made our lives infinately richer.	2003-07-21

Even for me, a teacher of American History, Franklin had been reduced to something of cliche.  He was the charming man who I sometimes saw walking the streets of Philadelphia when I resided there (seriously, there is a great actor who plays him).  Anyway, this book is superbly researched and well written.  It is accessible to all kinds of Franklin fans (or soon to be fans), students, scholars, and the average &quot;medicore&quot; class (as Franklin, according to the book, lovingly called them).  It is a fitting way to write a book about Franklin--filled with solid analysis and some great stories.  I laughed out loud many times.  The last section which is a defense of Franklin is outstanding.  The book is not a transcendent work.  Nor should it be.  It an honest and fair treatment of a man who should be revered.  Franklin was brillant, but always real.  So this grand biography.	2003-07-18

It was not a bad book by any stretch.  It was good, but not much happened (which, I will grant is much of Keller's life when he is not working).  However, the goofy and sarcastic conversations with Dot were too long.  Also, the ending was totally out there.  Still, there is a charm to Keller and I was pulling for him.  The strengths of &quot;Hit Man&quot; were not totally in evidence and in the end,the book had the slows.  Still, I love Keller hope there is a new novel about him soon.	2003-07-13

Ok, I'm not on the Dave Eggers is the greatest living writer bandwagon.  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius turned me off...indeed, I could not read it.  I passed it on to a friend, who I will admit is much smarter than I, and she loved it.  Still, it was not for me. Still, when I saw this book in paperback, it was worth a try.  I thought the concept was cool.  It seems there is additional text in this edition that was not in the hardcover--about 40 pages worth.  I'm not sure what the deal is with that--and the whole publishing only through McSweeney's, it is rather beyond me.  So, I judge the novel on the &quot;additional&quot; material (assuming that report is indeed correct and it was not in the original).<br />The book wears on you after awhile.  I loved many of Will's internal dialogues, but after awhile they got to me (of course, I read the book in about a day and half, so I did not enhjoy it like a fine wine).  Then suddenly, you have this new narrator, for, oh, a tenth of the novel, but this narrator breathes new life into the book.  You look at it completely differently.  You see more of the metaphor.  You see Will's pain in a new light (I'm being purposely vague).  The book has some interesting mistakes, which I think are intentional--factual things (was Hand's real name Justin or Francis?), but it makes it seem even better.  There are some interesting lessons here and the journey may indeed be the salvation.  I'm having trouble describing the book...sort of Brewster's Millions meets Ulysses meets Ronin meets Jack Keroukac?  It is worth your time.  Flawed and at times brilliant, far better than much of what is published today.	2003-07-11

I know that sounds like a 6th grade endorsement of this zippy novel (or short story collection?), but I'm just wild about Block's book.  It was fun (and quick) read that is perfect for summer.  Keller is killer as he well knows.  The stories are funny and sometimes surprising.  Even more, Keller gets to us.  He is a decent and moral man in his own way.  Block and Keller have a new fan.

Fowler writes in three parts and each part gets worse.  The first part, about falling in love, is good.  He captures the longing of love quite well.  The second part, after losing Camilla, quickly becomes a bad comic nightmare.  The last part, seems out of left field even this Oprah-soaked age (I'm being vague here because I don't want to ruin the ending).  Is this part satire?  I have no idea.  The book had it it's moments (great pop culture references at times).  But, in the end, it seems a little (pun intended) creepy and odd.	2003-07-07

I'm not sure what some of the reviewers were talking about when they bashed this book. This book, while slimmer than other bios about the Kennedys, rises to the top because of it's balance.  Thomas clearly admires his subject, but never romanticizes his subject.  He is honest, straight forward, and tells some amazing tales.  The book is riveting from page 1.

Why wasn't it more of a memoir?  Why was it filled with so much analysis?  Then, I realized that isn't really the point of this wonderful book.  Klosterman has made me a fan for life.  What wins me over his unbashed honesty. I've long held that the lowest critic life form is that of rock critic.  Klosterman calls them on their pretension.  He hammers away at what I have always believed is that music is important if it touches you.  My  MP3 collection has Sinatra and Warrant.  Who cares who is better, both form the soundtrack to important parts of my life.  Klosterman tells some hilarious stories and his takes on music and life is so refereshingly honest that I can't stop smiling.  He isn't mean or nasty--just tells it as he sees it.  DOn't agree?  That's ok.  I learned more than I ever imagined about '80s heavy metal (some which I finally realized I liked about 10 years too late) and I suspect I would have gotten more out of the book if I had understood all the references, but I loved what I read anyway.  Except for the passage where he compares the Gospels to GNR Lies, this book really does rock.  Isn't that the most important thing?	2003-06-18

I enjoyed the humor and generally well drawn characters.  The twists were good and the final one I did not see coming.  Meltzer is a good writer.  The climatic Disney World scene did go on too long and seem a bit too &quot;neat,&quot; and I had a bit of trouble suspending my disbelief.

He is funny, egotistical, and a bit sad.  However, he never loses sense of humor and &quot;writes&quot; with a flair.  The story is fascinating, but by the last 50 pages kind of goes a bit crazy.  I didn't figure out all of the mystery, which was good.  I think many thrillers kind of go nuts at the end trying to top last week's best seller.  What works here, and what makes it worth reading, is that fact that the novel does understand DC, the politics and the people.  The characters, Havlicek especially, are nicely drawn and generally well placed.  Some of it is absurd as I say, but still a fun ride.  I'll read the next one.	2003-06-11

I'm not usually a big fan of business books, but this one flows and rolls along.  It reads easily and with an honest eye (something those folks at the NY Times, Cohen's paper, sometimes have trouble with).

Anyway, this is was pleasure in that is was nicely written and the characters were finely drawn. The book is a bit of Single White Female (as a character in the book says), a bit of Chinatown, a bit of The Accused, and a bit of any movie that has a man in prison trying to drive his favorite cop crazy. The ending was a bit out there (as so many in this genre are), but what sets this book apart is the humanity. These are characters, all of them except maybe Fitz, who have heavy secrets dragging them down. They are all survivors (except Eddie Como) and Gardner deals with them fairly and honestly. Some of the book is hard to read as any good crime story should be, but in the end, there is hope.	2003-06-02

It was easy and, at times, quite amusing.  He is something of lovable Cad.  His New York is one most of us never get to experience and is somewhat exciting.  Still, after while, you start to wonder when love will find him again.  The stories aren't as outrageous as I hoped (perhaps I've watched too many sitcoms), although there are a few laughs.  The end, which was real life for him, seems cliched and forced (even if true).  And a bit sad.

In a sense, I'm glad I waited all these years to finally read it.  I think that I would not have enjoyed it at 14 the way I did at 28.  The book is beautiful elegy and mediation on a time long gone and the men who made up it's glory.  They bear littler resemblance to the stars of today.  I grew up with stories of the '52 World Series and the Dodgers.  This book gave me the gift of being able to exprience a bit of what my grandfather and father shared on that October day in 1952 as Joe Black took the mound against the Yankees.  I've always held the Dodgers in awe (the BRooklyn version at least) and this book allows me to see the men who made up those times as real people.  Pee Wee Reese emerges as Kahn's hero in the baseball parts.  I would argue that his father, Gordon, was almost as heroic to him.  It is beautiful book about boys, their fathers, and the ties that bind us to what is still, even in this day and age, the single greatest game ever invented.  This is a classic that should be read by every fan.  Thank you, Mr. Kahn.	2003-05-19

WITSEC is a fine and rather quick read.  Despite the fact that some may argue that the book skewed because one of the co-authors is the founder of the program, the book is balanced.  It discusses the mistakes and the successes.  There is some fascinating stuff here: the early fight against the mob, the Witness X tragic story (a woman who tells her own story), and a funny sequence exposing the ... \\"reporting\\" of Geraldo Rivera.  Schur is a hero...anyone with MS who can do what he does is.  The book seems to a bit rambling at times, but the stories keep you coming back for more.  There was a lot history on the US Marshals and that was a bit dry at times.  The book, overall, crackles with some fine stories.  In the end, the the light shed on this program makes it a great read for fans of law enforcement and the true crime genre.	2003-04-19

De Botton thoughts on memory and how we view relationships can be amazing.  He also can be funny.  I was impressed with many of his ideas.  On the other hand, by page 150 or so, I found the constant analysis of biographic form to be grating.  I can see why Isabel felt as she did at time (although she is no great woman by any means).  Again (as in On Love, a far superior book), we have a nameless narrator and no details on his life.  Oh well.  It is amusing at times, but not worth the time invested.

I really loved this book (I know I didn't give it 5 stars, but that is because it was a little too hollywood).  It got me.  The opening chapters, the part about Henry's teen life are so dead on that I still can't believe it.  The book has a silly premise, but Shepard himself knows that.  It works the vast majority of the time.  It is quick and sweet read.  My biggest complain is the subplot of Sophie's secret past.  It is a little too much.  The reality of it seemed a bit cartoonish and ended too neatly.  Still, the rest of the book works.  I was surprised by the ending and enjoyed it.  It made me laugh (particularly the line about Starsky and Hutch from the Nigerian grad student at the college) and made me a bit misty.  It ain't perfect, but it sure is sweet.

Perhaps, as I did, you figured out one small piece...but that is the joy the book--the surprises.  Will Klein is one of the most fundamentally decent leads I have come across in quite some time.  The book is engrossing, I literally could not put it down (and when I had to, I missed it!).  Coben's fun and insightful prose makes the book worth more than the price.  Squares, a fantastic character, deserves a book of his own.  Coben has won himself a new fan and I hope many of you will join the club.  Will Klein deserves that much.

I was too cheap to buy the 11 Karens in paperback, so here I was looking at an old (1991) novel that I could buy and be happy with.

It tells you more than you wanted to know about Benjamin Disraeli.  However, the satire does not get out of hand and somehow you could almost envision the plot twists actually happening in real life.  The book is well written and funny as can be.

Like Koufax's 1965 perfect game, this biography achieves something close to perfection.  Not a typical sports bio in any sense, Leavy constructs a beautiful story.  It is one that weaves fans, stories, stats, and Koufax himself.  It treats him with tremendous respect--something many biographies never do.  It does not gossip or speculate.  It enlightens.  It tells of time a I never got to see (and one none of us shall ever see again).  It makes Koufax real and, in a sense, that makes him even more of hero.

I knew nothing of Katzenbach's books (although Just Cause was solid movie) and nothing of this extraordinary thriller. Katzenbach is a fine writer of prose (if a bit wordy). The book works on many levels. It is far deeper than any Grisham novel. It makes many illusions to a classical education, although one will enjoy the book a great deal without it. <br />One measure of a good read like this not being able to figure out the mystery too far ahead...and I certainly did not. What I truly loved was that each of the three parts of the book got more interesting and deepened the mystery. I don't want to reveal too much here, so I will be vague. I will say this...everytime you think Katzenbach is usuing a cliche of the genre, he twists the plot a little more. It works and works beautifully. The end was immensely satisfying.<br />My one only issue with this book is the back cover. It mistakenly claims that if Starks does not figure out who Mr. R is, each of his 52 relatives will be killed one by one. That is an enormous error. Only ONE relative is targeted for destruction. It amazes me that a big publishing house like this would allow a book to have jacket plot summary that proven wrong in the first 15 pages. Hello? Why do I bet that they did not get the blurbs wrong praising the book? Or that the price was correct?<br />Oh well, just a minor quibble. Ignore the back of the book and read what is inside.

I've read many a book on crime, but never has the author known the subject so well.  It lends a fascinating and spooky feel to the narrative.  The book is a bit long and can be a bit slow at points, but that is bound to happen when the last 100 pages or so are updates (from '86, '89, and '00).  Nevertheless, the Bundy shown is the whole man. I think that is incredibly important.  Some will argue that Bundy is strictly a monster and should not be humanized.  I disagree.  What makes Bundy (and those like him) so terrifying is their very humanity.  And their ability to so easily destroy the humanity of others.	2003-02-12

I'm a few years younger than Zevin, but his book hit home.  It is laugh out loud funny.  An incredibly quick read, but I found myself recommending it everyone I knew--it is well worth the [$$$].  At a few points, Zevin reads like a younger version of Joe Queenan (only nicer).  I love Queenan so I mean that as high compliment.  Zevin strikes chords hilarious (like the manners chapter--his description of &#34;Nick&#34; the future drug dealer is priceless) and sentimental (see his chapter on his time in Spain and Denmark).  He clearly loves his wife and that is a refreshing change from some other young writers.  Whatever Zevin has cookin' next, I'm there.  update: 1/2017 It is now 14 years since I read this...and I still recall it with fondness.  I ended the original review with &#34;Whatever Zevin has cookin' next, I'm there.&#34;  Well, that is &#34;Dan Gets a Mini-Van.&#34; I'm not married and looking to having a family.

This book sheds new light on many old cases.  INstead of reading 10,000 pages on Jack the Ripper, you can reconsider the case in a brisk 90.  I was most fascinated by the JonBenet Ramsey portion of the book.  Many of lambasted Douglas for his belief in the Ramseys' not guilty stance.

It is not even close to his worst effort, Shampoo Planet.  The story here is fantastical like the story in &quot;Girlfriend in a coma,&quot; but it works.  With DC you always need to suspend disbelief.  Enjoy his satire and fall in love with his characters.  There are some universal truths about families in here.  It is an incredibly fast read.

As a fan of his work on Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, I was excited to read his memoir.  His book is actually better than most of his TV work.  There is a poignancy to the writing that really stands out (and could be found in some of his TV work too), but the book is always better than the movie anyway.  The book is hilariously blunt.  Most of us had one or two of these embarrassing events happen to us as children, but how many of us had 278 pages worth?  You will indeed laugh so hard that you will cry and perhaps even want to cry.  Feig is clearly one of the good guys.  He remembers a time that was indeed simpler--but not one that has gone away.  Every kid has his traumas reading about his make your own more endurable.  I'm recommending this extraordinary book to everyone I know.  If only more people had his honesty and insights, the young adult world would be a better place.  Nevertheless, kids like Feig make super adults.	2002-12-22

This collection gets bogged down however.  Many of the stories are dated and the updates are not recent.  Many of the stories are reprinted in the far superior colleciton, Justice.  Still, parts of this book, particularly the Gloria Vanderbilt story, stand out.  If you like Dunne, I would start with Justice and move backwards.  It is fun to read many of his stories do have something of a timeless quality. I was frustrated with parts of book which seemed dated and dull. Ahh..what do I know.  Dunne is still great.	2002-12-22

Here, in a noble yet dull way, he talks about children and protecting them.  Important?  Yes.  Interesting?  Not here.  Also, the incredibly long part of the book about the life and death of the young marine was interestng, but got long winded.

This novel in the form of memoir is filled with thinly veiled fictional that exactly follows Dunne's life in LA during the Simpson murder trials.  He even quotes his actual articles from Vanity Fair at the beginning of each chapter.  Nevertheless, this book is filled with wonderful and fascinating scenes.  Who knew that Nancy Reagan met Heidi Fleiss?  Or that Princess Margaret found the trial to be a bore?  That that Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and Elizabeth Taylor were all fascinated by the trial?  Several reviewers have admonished Dunne for name dropping.  That is absurd.  Dunne admits he does it, and frankly, it is fun.  This isn't as much about the trial as the life outside of it and that was terrific new perspective.  The ending of this novel could be called almost comic and Dunne took a lot of heat for it, but it makes an important point about celebrity in our culture.  I don't want to ruin the mystery, although it becomes obivous early on.  One could argue that Bailey (Dunne), who lived through celebrity gossip and stories, that he died by the proverbial sword.  There is a certain poetic justice to it.  Nevertheless, a juicy read for those still fascinated by the OJ trial and Dunne.	2002-09-30

Dunne moves in circles that I scarely knew existed anymore.  Well, I knew they were around of course, just not in my world.  He exists often in a world that the Society pages in our newspapers once fawned over.  Those days, as Joe Epstein argues in &quot;Snobbery&quot; are largely gone.  However, Dunne moves in what is left of it.  But, what sets him apart (makes him far more than a name dropper that some ridicule him for being) is his compassion for victims.  His own loss is moving.  He is funny, warm, honest, and never pulls his punches.  He is elegant and real.  This book of essays is well worth your time.	2002-09-22

Jennifer Belle has called it  \\"totally orignal\\" which is not exactly true, but does have some original moments and characters.  You can't help but fall in love with Evie and her extraordinary patience.  Harry is hard to love, but somehow you cheer for him.  At times he reminded of Rob from High Fidelity (all arrested development and commitment phobic).  Nevertheless, our American boy does ok.  There are things that Harry goes through that many of us who are single and 28 (or there abouts) and live in the big city go through.  He captures, with wonderful and painful truth, the awful feelings of losing someone you love.  And the moral of this non-fairy tale fairy tale: To love someone, you must love yourself is not new--but told with humor and heart.  The ending was a bit surpising, but not at all disappointing.  I read most the book in one day.  I enjoyed it.  Davies writes very well and he clearly loves language.  Was Judith based on Judith Reagan I wonder?  I still have some questions, but overall I'd recommend this fine debut.  Harry is something of hairball, but to some he may become a hero.	2002-09-08

I thought the book sounded fascinating.  And indeed, parts of it are.  Feeling generous, I gave it four stars.  I found parts of it be not well played (characters fade away--time shifts too quickly).  In other parts of the book, I was geniunely moved by the characters and their traumas.  There is a sense of growth--particularly in Roz and Miranda (Roz most of all, who becomes just a wonderful person--we see that Miranda is missing out during her rebellious years).  Other plot twists I might have done without, but still, that is how life isn't it?  We can't pick and choose what happens.  Nissen seems to have drawn on some of her real life (as she hints at in her acknowledgements) and it may well be unfair to judge her twists and turns, particulalry if they are real.  PErsonally, I liked Edwin and Darrin a great deal and would ahve liked to hear more from them.  At it's heart, this is a story about mother and daughter.  Being neither a mother or daughter, I might not be the best to comment on this book--however, in the end (and I Loved the END) they are indeed good people.

I stumbled across De Botton's book years ago in  book store, but didn't have the patience to read it (ugh, I didn't like philosophy in college, why read it again?).  A friend recommended How Proust Can Change your Life to me a few years back, but I forgot about that too.  Then, reading Joe Epstein's Snobbery (which is filled with Proust quotes), I ventured out and started my de Botton education with On Love.  What a tour de force.  I found myself laughing and cringing in acknowledgement of the universality of the situations.  As one who deconstructs love much like our nameless hero (although without the classical references, I tend to use TV as source material), I found this book refreshing and honest.  He realizes in the end, that falling in love is indeed folly, but the kind of folly that makes heroes.  Read this wonderful book.	2002-08-22

The book is at it's strongest when Epstein talks about his own snobbish tendencies.  A few parts are a bit slow, particularly in the beginning, but your faith will be rewarded in the second part of the book when Epstein goes after various kinds of snobbery.  The book is strengthed by Epstein's admission to his own snobberies--as they used to say it takes one to know one (and indeed as Epstein titles one chapter)--and can't help but have you look at yourself often.  Epstein quotes many writers in his book and at times I wanted to shut the book rather than read another Balzac or Proust quote.  Nevertheless, there are times when Epstein is so on target--particularly about the French--that you laugh out loud.  I wonder what Epstein would say about all the media attention his book has been getting....<br />A great snapshot of America in the 21st century.  We need more writers like him.	2002-08-15

Am I'm thrilled it is paperback...the new price should allow even more readers to find deep pleasure in this book.  The characters are deeper and growing up.  The book has a darker tone, but it all fits the way of the teenage world.  I applaud Ms. Rowling for being true to the growing up issues as well as the magic.

It was a wonderful and hopeful book.  Jeremy is about as average as you can get, but has a good and decent heart.  He is a kid struggling to find his place in the world.  10th grade is a year that many ignore--Weisberg was wise to set his novel during that year.  In fact, the era, the early 1980s is evoked with great care.  Jeremy even likes Air Supply.  His quirks and nuances make him all the more real.  The way he makes friends and floats through school is pitch perfect.  I think the fact that Weisberg did not go Hutch Falls but still captures the feelings of being speaks to the universality of being young.  One huge strength of this novel is that is hopeful.  It reminds me, as a school teacher, that kids are wonderful.  Kids are hopeful, and in the end, they are going to be ok.  This should be required reading for teachers and students everwhere.

Our characters grow and deepen--indeed, Harry and Ron show that they are indeed 13 in this book.  What amazed me were the constant twists and turns.  Just as I thought I figured out what was going on, I learned I was wrong.  I adored RJ Lupin--what a wonderful new character.  I don't want to say too much about the plot--a reader deserves to discover the joy of these books for themselves.  I'll say that Malfoy and Snape still drive me nuts.

Yes, he is mean.  Yes, he is cruel.  And yes, he is hilarious.  If people are so offended by his material, why read it?  Oh well, that is a subject for one of Queenan's own articles.  I could not put this book down.  This is third Queenan book I've read (along with Cineplex Heckler and Red Lobster) and this is as good or better than the other two.  He makes many of the same points that Nick Hornby tries to in \\"How to Good.\\"  The difference (besides the fact that one is fiction) is that Queenan nails it.  He tries hard to be good and fails.  Of course he does.  Neverthless, the journey is fascinating.  He is one of the few writers who doesn't give a damn and tells you how he feels.  You don't have agree with everything he says to enjoy his work.  I admire a guy with those kind of guts (and who grew up on the mean streets of Philly--they grow guys like this there on trees).  In addition, several critics have commented on his \\"right wing\\" writing--which is hilarious because Queenan slams the right wing many times in his book.  He also dares to take on the leftists.  He tries to learn about their culture and realizes that is filled with some good ideas--but is also subject many hypocritical failings.  I laughed outloud countless times. Ok, so maybe I'm just the kind of Yuppie trash that Queenan is, but he really hits the nail on the head.  As a photograph of America at the turn of the century and all it's absurdities, Queenan hits another home run.  He wins again--which is better than he beloved 1964 Phillies did.	2002-06-14

There is something about this last one that I just couldn't connect with.  Dr. Katie Carr is not all that sympathetic.  There were times I wanted to shake her and send to see Dr. Phil.  Of course, she lives in England.  Nevertheless, I applaud Hornby for the risks he took in this book...and there are some interesting ruminations.  In the end, I found myself not connected to Katie (Or David or Goodnews or Molly or Brian...etc) they way I was connected to Will and Rob of his other novels.  My favorite part was seeing Dick from High Fidelity make a cameo here.  Not a homerun, but I will be reading whatever he has cooking up next.	2002-05-27

The medicine I was on did not help me feel better, but this book did. What a terrific read. It goes fast, but hits all the right notes. Nanny is wonderful character--a welcome change from many of the current novels about young single women in the city, she is not like Ally McBeal or Bridget Jones. Sure, she has a few flaws...but accepts them. She is caring and delightful woman. Mrs. X is an accurate look at a special kind of woman (and the same is true of Mr.X) that you only find in New York. The tone is pitch perfect. I found myself thinking of Sherman McCoy a bit. If Bonfire of the Vanities had taken a different turn, the McCoys might have hired Nanny. A rare book that captures the zeitgeist perfectly. It is well worth all the hype.	2002-04-22

I kept seeing the novel as a film from the time--it just has the right feel.  The characters are affecting and their stories enthrall you.

I'm not sure how much of it is autobiographical, but the details about Hollywood seem right on.  It is hilarious in places and has potential to be quite touching in others (if not always reaching it). I enjoyed the odd trip through 1990 Hollywood.  A worthy and breezy read.	2002-04-02

After reading Ken Grimwood's Replay, I developed an abiding interest in the subject of time travel.  Left cold by Hollywood's most recent version, I returned easily to the realm of the novel.  I stumbled upon Delacorte's book on Amazon, and couldn't be more glad that I did.  As a fan of both early hollywood and politics, this novel could not have been more up my alley.  However, you need not be a fan of both.  The novel's plot, summarized several times over on this page, is original and fun.  The story flows well, the characters are intriguing and well drawn.  The joy of Delacorte's novel is in the details.  It gets them just so.  He spent a good deal of time on the novel and it shows. It is warm, witty, and geniunely original.  I couldn't recommend this comic novel more highly.  Dutch, Gabriel, Jasper, and Lorna are worth the read. It poses ethical questions to be sure and does not (despite what the whiny Kirkus Review says) supply answers.  As any good ethicist knows, it is not possible to answer these questions.  The ending, of which I will say nothing, is tantalzing.  Delacorte has said he would like to write a sequel.  It is now 5 years later and we're still waiting. Can I travel ahead in the future on the time machine to find out when it is coming out?	2002-03-26

Medavoy is a character I've read about before, most notably in Hit and Run, one of the most fascinating Hollywood books ever written.  He has been behind many fantastic movies and worked with some terrific characters.  However, this book misses it's mark--it is really worth 3.5 stars but I rounded down.  There are interesting stories--particularly about building a movie company, but the stories are without that depth that the best Hollywood books provide.  There are almost no personal details about Medavoy's life--which while he probably wants to maintain his privacy, leave the story lacking.  His political adventures are interesting, but more interesting that his personal life?  He is critical of people, but in a way that leaves you wanting more.  Perhaps I love dirt, and Medavoy is too classy for that.  Perhaps he wants to maintain his working relationships.  Nevertheless, he plays humble, and probably is.  Autobiographies in Hollywood are a tricky genre, but Robert Evans provided a terrific read with the Kid Stays in the Picture.  This books has a good stories and interesting moments, but was at times slow and often told the same story over and over.  We got the point the first time Mike.  I'm not upset I read it, but expected so much more.  He has must have some great stories in there somewhere...	2002-03-22

And this book, like the movie, was mediocore.  There are indeed some hilarious and well observed moments--I won't dispute that McInerney is a talented word smith--and those are numerous (the thanksgiving dinner, the very last chapter, etc).  But this book never quite feels like a story--more odd observations and bizarre plot twists.  The email stalker?  Why?  The best satires also tell a good story, this one fails at times.  As the old saying goes, There is no &quot;there&quot; there.  As it attempts to prove how shallow the world is (was in the late 1990s), it is victim of its own shallowness.  I was really disappointed.  Several reviews here adore it, but not me.  The author even attempts to mock himself the book.  He attempts to make fun of literary critics who have trashed him--he metions himself in a review of the fictional Jeremy Green's book.  It was supposed to be funny I guess, but it struck me as too much.  The very last chapter had a style and wit about it, I just wish the rest of the book had that feel more often.  In the end, it was just sort of blah--like the white t-shirt on the cover.	2002-03-10

But what is the truth of time?  Of our lives?  Of death?  Ken Grimwood's book is wonderful exploration of time and the meaning of life.  I didn't find it preachy or cheesy or anything other than sincere and geniune.  The message of the book is a common one, but it is told with such insight and creativity that it will touch you in a new way.  This is a rare book in that could possibly change the way you are living your life.  While I can't credit this extraordinary novel with that, I can at least say it got me thinking about my world and my place in it.  The idea of replaying your life over and over is a powerful one.  What decisions would you make differently?  What does it mean to us now?  I don't want to say too much about the plot--it deserves to be discovered by a first time reader.  The details are fantastic here.  It even had insights on the terrorism issues we face today.  Though written in 1986, the book is not at all dated.  Whatever you make of the book, your life will touched. You will never forget the experience of Jeff Winston and how he touched you.	2002-03-04

I was drawn to this book for two reasons.  1) The cover says \\"Thirty ...\\" (which is funny) 2)The back of the book which speaks of, well, all the pop culture references.  I'm sucker for that stuff I guess.  Everything from Three's Company to Billy Joel (whose lyrics play a role--a first in a novel I've seen)is in there.  The more astute among you may find parts formulaic.  Yet, that really didn't bother me.  Look at what sells in this genre of fiction today--all these books about plucky single ladies from London.  If you are touched by a book, isn't that all that matters?<br />Tropper gets the details right.  I'm closing in on 30 and share many of the feelings as our narrator, Ben.  Trouble letting go of the past, fear of the future, etc.  The music of 1980s, Star Wars, Seinfeld...these things were part of our lives and Tropper doesn't put them in to be cute.  He puts them in because people actually look at life through the prism of these things.  Tropper mentions an idea that I had discussed with my own friends (isn't it cool when you see your ideas validated by a good writer?)--the idea that Gen X is unified by it's pop culture.  Many of us were.  <br />I cared deeply about these characters and found myself reading 200 pages in one day just to see what happened.  The plot, as Booklist says, is a bit like The Big Chill.  And the Jack-Alison relationship bears an uncanny resemblance to the Rob Lowe-Mare Winningham relationship in St. Elmo's Fire.  Except that the Alison character is far more appealing than the Mare Winnigham character (and Jack more appealing than Rob Lowe--in anything).  Some of the events in the book do fit together a bit too perfectly, but it is fiction.  And in the big picture, it was a book that gets it right.  In fact, Tropper writes a great first novel.  Now, why I can't meet a Lindsey?	2002-02-24

He does a wonderful job here.  The book is part bio, part history of immigrants in America, and part memoir.  It works on all levels.  Hamill treats Frank with the respect he deserves.  The book is not a gossipy memoir--Kitty Kelly fans should look elsewhere.  Instead, he makes the important arguement that Sinatra gave voice to first, a generation, and then an entire country.  His artisty is what matters.  The myth of the man is fun and gets most the attention, but that is besides the point for Hamill.  And he is right.  We all talk about the &quot;Sinatra in a hat&quot; (as Hamill dubs him) and the Rat Pack--but the music endures.  It is, argues Hamill, what matters in the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.  It is what will stand the test of time and give voice to a thousand broken dreams, hearts, and help us--like Frank after the Fall--get back up and start all over again.  Thanks, Pete Hamill for getting it right.	2002-02-18

I love Coupland--Microserfs, Life After God, Miss Wyoming, and Coma, are all good reads...some excellent. The good news is that he has matured and grown as a writer. The bad news is that Shampoo planet is majorly disappointing. Perhaps I expected too much--maybe the 10 years has dated the novel--but it just doesn't work. The characters are rather two dimensional...the revelations are like the infomericals that Stephanie auditions for. I kept reading and reading hoping it would get better. It did not. It had a few fine moments and interesting scenes. Coupland had not yet found his voice. I should have known I was in trouble when \\"Elle\\" gave the biggest blurb. It gets three stars because of some very funny moments and that zeitgeist voice of Coupland--but you are better off with any of his other books. I hope that GenX proves a better read.

The story is a bit creepy.  Or so it seemed.  It has all of Coupland's trademark wit, humor, crackling ideas, and insights.  The characters are fairly well drawn and Richard makes a particularly warm hearted main character.  Linus and Wendy too.  Is it a perfect book?  No.  But it is original and where it is not, it winks to it's inspirations.  Coupland takes chances with this book--and that is what I like about it.  Does the end (and end of the world) work as well as you might hope?  Not exactly, but it is hopeful.  Like \\"Life After God\\" Coupland wants to look inside ourselves and consider our lives.  Our world.  What of it?  Is it all bad?  No.  These characters--a ghost, a coma victim, drugged out TV people, a doctor, etc...get us to think.  I applaud Coupland.  He tackles similar issues in Miss Wyoming too.  Wymoing is a more traditional look at these issues--love as salvation.  Here, it is even bigger as we ponder faith, self-improvement, etc.  So, sometimes we go to Plan B or it takes us, as Jared says, until the third time to learn.  Coupland makes us THINK and may not be as profound as some reviewers might wish--but does it matter.  He can touch you.  Isn't that the most important thing?	2002-01-24

I generally avoid &quot;chick&quot; novels, but have enjoyed books by Amy Sohn and Jennifer Belle.  Both books had an edge and some laugh out loud humor to them. What She Saw.., I had hoped, would be in the same vein.  Rosenfeld writes well enough.  I enjoyed her conceit--each guy was a chapter--it was original enough.  But, I didn't find Phoebe all that appealing.  It was hard to like her.  Maybe it is because I'm a guy (probably most like Neil in the book) and find her kind of sad.  Perhaps I did not &quot;get&quot; what the book was really about.  Her salvation in the end, did not come with the kind of depth that many other Gen X novelists have found.  There are no great insights here.  A few good chapters to be sure and some sad moments that do hit home.  In the end, I feel like Phoebe did so often.  A bit empty, confused, and looking for something better.  I'm not sorry I read it--but I think other Gen X first novels may have more to offer.  Perhaps I just missed something here.	2002-01-21

It sounds so inane.  Nevertheless, the content is pretty darned good.  A fascinating look at the Rise and long fall of Rat Pack, Levy constructs a fascinating, if not particularly deep book.  The stories may be familar to many, but for someone who is not initmately familar with the Summit crew, it is a great intro.  I've been a Frank guy for a long time, but now I know a bit more about the other packers.  Levy is honest and straight forward.  The stories about the Kennedys, the mob, the women, and oh yeah, the music are all here.  The book is written in a style not unlike the boys--kind of all over the place, but it gets it right when the spotlight is on.  It treats the subjects, all, with some degree with sympathy--with Peter and Sammy emerging with a great deal of sadness.  A worthwhile and at times absorbing read.  Levy is much less confident when he talks about the music--and is better when he deals with the stories.  I enjoyed the last few chapters which deal with his analysis of the end.  A well thought out thesis and about the last great American party.  Well worth the 15 bucks.	2002-01-17

It breaks no new literary ground, but keeps you interested from beginning to end.  I've long been fascinated by the entertainment industry (both in fiction and non-fiction form).  I had never been much interested in the music industry, but Entertainment Weekly recommended the book and who I am to disagree?  More seriously, this comic look at life in the big corporate world of music is really interesting.  I'm guessing that Wild Bill is based on Clive Davis or someone like him.  Jim, our hero, is a sympathic guy and we pull for him.  We also pull for Wild Bill and some of the music acts.  The characters are not all that well drawn, but enough so that you are interested.  As many satricial novels, that is beyond the point.  Flangan casts a critical eye at an ever changing industry and tells a fun story along the way.  It won't win any big awards, but is a good read for those who like the entertainment industry.	2002-01-14

While I enjoyed Microserfs for it's witty and satirical look at life in the mid to late 1990s, but this book has much more depth.  Life After God, a super book, shows the depths that Coupland is capable of.  Again, he does not abandon the style that brought him this far.  Colgate and Johnson (who seems supiciously like Don Simpson, if Simpson had lived and found redemption) are fully drawn and lively characters.  You care about what happens to them.  Colgate's Jonbenet/Tina Yothers (okay, not a beauty queen) life rings true.  Johnson sets out like John Sullivan in Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels.  The results of his journey are different, but just as important.  The love story and mystery work well.  Miss Wyoming works as satire, love story, and social commentary.  A terrific read.	2002-01-14

Chrissie is an original and endearing character.  Hornburg does a nice job of capturing the teen-angtsy thing.  The plot does get rather absurd toward the end (I see Miramax is making a movie--did they offer script notes on the end?  It was very hollywood).  The pleasure of the novel is experiencing life thru Chrissie's eyes.  It is an easy and interesting read.  Well worth the few hours it should take you to read it.  Several Chicagoans have complained about geographical lapses--I enjoyed the setting (come on, Downers Grove--what a perfect title and town name), even if he missed abit on details about the Chicagoland area.  It was supposed to represent the midwest--not be exact in streets and stores.  Lighten up readers and get the important part of the story.

The whole David Eggers is finest writer we have train passed me by.  Nevertheless, I bought Schickler's book--it sounded intriguing, was a first novel about young people and romance--or so I thought.<br />The reviewers here all have differing and interesting thoughts.  I'm probably not going to have many original insights at this point, but I wanted to endorse this astounding work of fiction.  <br />The first sign of how much I liked this is that is that I'm nervous that this will become a movie.  I can see the the James-Rally-Patrick triangle becoming a film--and them casting Christian Bale in some absurd (patrick's word)attempt to capture the zeitgeist--yikes.  The essence of this book is in Schickler's voice, his deceptively simple writing.  The detail, the rich voice, the subletity of the writing.  <br />The stories are all gently connected and it is fun to see small details and characters appearing again and again.  The weakest story, by far, is the first one.  Checkers and Donna.  However, we are introduced to some themes and characters who will come up again.  Several reviewers have touched on the weakness of the female characters--and while I don't even come close to agreeing with that assessment--Checkers and Donna might make you squirm.  However, the rest of the book just traps you.  I felt like a young James hiding in his dumb waiter and drowning out the rest of the world as I was propelled deeper into the story.  <br />There is a change of pace--from comic to darkly comic to dark to light again.  However, it works, if you are willing to go with Schickler.  The magic is there--actual magic perhaps.  Jacob's Bath is a moving &amp; beautiful story.  Rally and James make a couple, who, you care for deeply.  The book touches on huge themes--themes I'd studied in literature classes from dayone--grace, sins, and salvation (or remdemption).  <br />Just who is Sender the doorman?  Who is the mysterious JOhn castle--could it be...?  Even Thomas Merchant seems otherworldy. I won't spoil this review with ruining the plot (esp. the last 3 chapters/stories), but there is some definate addressing of life's biggest issues.  Salavation of some kind or another is found by the all the characters, even young actor Jeremy Jaxx (I think).  Not an original theme, but starkly rendered at times (Patrick's &quot;awful grace&quot;), lyrical at others (Talking to Otis among others), and wonderfully romantic (&quot;It can happen like that sometimes.  The city can tilt its hand and let two people fall for each other as completely&quot; as they did).<br />Nitpick if you will.  I say spend that time reading and enjoying a welcome new voice to our American canon.  You can keep your David Eggers, I'll hang out with David Schickler.	2001-10-01

The Wishbones had some<BR>terrific moments, but was not, in my humble opinion, a great work.  It was a fun read.  Joe College has more depth and nuance<BR>to it.  It nicely a evokes a time, 1982, almost 20 years gone as of this writing.  Several critics have mentioned that not much seems to happen to our hero, Danny.  I would agree on the surface--and even the end seems a bit unispired at first.  But as I look back, I see Perrotta does a fine job capturing feelings of a time.  That junior year of college.  Those relationships (albeit we all had different circumstances, but parts of them and the feelings ring true).  He takes those in a fascinating commentary (again, not that deep, but still interesting) about<BR>class issues, finding yourself, and ultimately, learning to face life.  This issue isn't that Danny doesn't seem to learn from his mistakes--he is 20. He is learning by doing and he tells us his tale because he has learned, he has accepted somethings, and grown.  While it is not profound, it is consistently entertaining.	2001-09-27

Masters does a fine job of telling Eisner's (and the stories of those around him--Katzenberg, Diller, etc)story.  Something about Eisner has always bit a bit unreal--even smarmy at times--and Masters holds nothing back.  It isn't always balanced, but overall is fair.  The details and stories are terrific--until the last 1/5th of the book.  I was engrossed until the story turned the Katzenberg trial--where Masters drowned us in the details.  I love details, but at times one needed a road map to keep.  Masters is to be commended for a journalistic/insiders account of that dark time for Disney, but wow...I just had a time staying focused.  However, on the whole the book is well worth the paper back price.  You'll learn how Disney has never really gotten over the death of Frank Wells and why all those executives keep leaving.  It is indeed a grim place; Eisner's inner sanctum.  It is also another fascinating book.	2001-09-23

Meade's book will never be mistaken for a work of great biography. The book is fascinating nevertheless. Particularly for all the gossipy stuff. We are spared the whining of Mia's own book, and the get rich quick trash of the maid who wrote a book about the one of '90s greatest scandals. I'm an enormous Allen fan and have seen each and everyone of his movies--Meade doesn't pretend to be a movie critic, but spins some interesting tales. I admit I enjoyed the gossip. It is actually pretty well balanced--there is no defending Woody's actions of course. But Mia has long since been martyred and Meade tells us just what a kook Mia is. While completely unauthorized, it is still accurate. Eric Lax's bio, with Woody's blessing, is the better of the two most famous one (including this) and has been reissued. They are fun to read as companion pieces however. I have not yet read John Baxter's recent bio, perhaps in the near future--so I cannot compare. If you love Woody's art, stick to the critical pieces by the academics (Reconstructing Woody, and countless ones from university presses). If you want gossip and some insight, start here. A fun read to learn more about own of our greatest artists--warts and all.	2001-09-04

Every so often, and not often enough, we find ourselves given a gift--a surprise gift. A gift of a novel, that changes the very way we look at ourselves and the world around us. Books alone seem to have that ability to transform us. The best of all are the books we don't expect to change things for us. The Last Convertible is one of those books. This book immediately takes it's place on my top ten list. I bought it because it was called &quot;a coming of age&quot; novel by one critic. Coming of age stories are among my favorite genres. I had just finished a nice coming of age story of the mid-90s, the Fundamentals of Play (which interestingly has a loyal narrator named George, a Currier type in Chat, and vapid Chris, with it's Kate--but this probably only interests me). A group of people who came of age in the times I had. It was good read. Myrer's Fusiliers (as the 5 men were called) were of the era of my grandparents, so I had no idea what to expect. What I found, pretty much from page one, was a story that would not let go. I finished the second half of the book in 2 days, refusing to put it down. I would read it, go out in &quot;real world&quot; and feel as though the characters and feelings were walking with me. These characters and times are no more--but the feelings are universal. Russ, Jean-Jean, Terry, Dal, Chris (the mysterious and ever deeping charm of Christabel), the infuriating Nancy, Ron, Peg, Irene, the sordid Kay Madden, the unforgettable Liz Payne, Amanda, and Teddy. Not to mention Dr. Mel, Opp, and the Countess. There are so many characters that flood through the years of this novel, yet they all touch you in surprising ways. And of course, the Empress--symbol and fact. Above them of all, is one of my all-time literary heroes, the seemingly ordinary George Virdon.<BR>Grog, Vird, George, call him what you will...keeper of the flame, the steady, old reliable, the loyal, the blindly loyal (?) and truly heroic George. Sarge. Dad. Husband. and Friend.<br />George is what makes this story for me. As his friends fortunates rise and fall, as his marriage strains and soars, and his children grow, suffer, and live, he fights on. George is endlessly nostaglic, but as Chris tells us, he manages to grow up--somehow. George understands the importance of memory, the mystical power of letters and pictures and objects (even big ones like the Empress). He suffers enormously at times but always maintains his dignity. Nancy is no easy woman, but he endures. George does more than endure however, he maintains the eternal flame. While George is never rich, never quite poor...he is the wealthiest of all the Fusiliers of Fox Entry. He knows that what matters in this world is love. Love--with it's loyalty, pain, schisms, dreams--broken, borrowed, lost and sometimes won, losses, and profound moments...for George it is all about love, moments, and a bit o' stardust. George, as he tells several times, might take longer to understand, but he always knows the score. He denies himself, but he is really the glue of the novel and these men's (and women's lives). He saves lives. Literally and figuratively...if he is still with us, pushing 80 by now, he is probably doing the same. Young Ron, like a generation before him, is transformed by knowing George. And so was I. Thank you George and thank you Anton Myrer.	2001-09-03

As much as I wish things like this never happened, even at the nation's elite schools--he is correct.  And parents like Tess do exist.  Sadly, that is an accurate portrait.  Kids like Amanda, the quiet, but special ones, can easily slip through the cracks.  As an educator, I've seen it and heard about from colleagues at day schools and boarding schools across the country.  For his call to arms (perhaps that was a very poor choice of words),I praise Mr. Bunting.  <br />The book itself is not as good as his message.  The writing is at times rather disaffected.  Others passionate.  Flowerly prose that seems at odds with the passages.  Even more, the incessant foreshadowing takes away from what could have been a subtle story.  You figure out early where this is headed.  A &quot;coming of age novel&quot; as one reviewer on the jacket called it--is something of a different sort.  The characters are not all that vivid...they are rather thin (pun intended)--perhaps that was the point and I missed it.  I could go on and on, but don't want to say much else.  <br />Important lesson. A Execution. B-	2001-08-20

However, I knew some of these types, in college and high school (midwest prep school).  Perhaps, like Harry Lombardi, I find myself fascinated by a group that I've never been a part of.  While I never had the desire to break into the group, I'm fascinated, like George, by their innerworkings.  I make it a practice to read as many first novels as possible.  I find their strength and beauty to be wonderful.  The Fundamentals of Play is a triumph.  Is the finest book I've ever read??...No, but is engrossing.  The characters are well drawn...Chat? Chat Whethers is grand. The situations are great.  This novel, set in the just pre-internet world of 1993/94 (or so I've guessed) tells the story of a fading way of life.  Not only does Macy comment, through George (she writes men well) on the oddities of Whit Stillman's Metropolitan Kids (the recent touchstone of this set)...but puts her own spin on it.  I won't even compare this to Gatsby...why? Macy tells her own story.  Most of all, it captures the spirit of young people, fighting against the march of time, clinging to the past and its idols.  It is about a univeral desire for acceptance and finding a place in the world.  Kate...well her attraction is almost mystical...we all knew a Kate.  While the sitatuions might be a million miles away to you, the feelings are something that reside in your heart.  Cheers, Ms. Macy!	2001-08-16

Exisquitely details and finely told, the story of Lew Wasserman is one for the ages.  The history of hollywood is terrific.  Some have called this an unfair bashing of a legend--I say it is a fairly balanced portrait of a complex and cold man.  Lew is admirable in his own way.  My only real issue with the book is the connections that McDougal draws between MCA and the Mob.  Clearly, they did do some work together, but the endless sections about the later years (rudnick's work, etc)--get to be confusing (so many names  and no glossary) and ulimately without revelation.  Lots of accusations.  Some of it is interesting (the Sidney Korshak stuff) and some dull.  The book is best when focused on Lew and those around him (non-mafia types).  A terrific read for the patient and fan of Hollywood behind the scenes books.	2001-08-12

I must admit I loved this book.  It is pure gossip and not exactly Dickens.  But, Evans is completely honest and his own harshest critic.  He tells fantastic stories (was there a woman in Hollywood he did not date between 1950 and 1980?).  He takes responsiblity for the many, many mistakes in his life and spins fantastic yarns.  Toward the end, it can be a bit annoying reading about how once again, he made the right choice and get railroaded by justice, but at the same time, you care about him.  Those amazingly honest stories (particularly about his destruction of his marriages--the story on Phyllis George is a hoot) make the book even more interesting.  A must read for film fans and anyone interested in one of our more fascinating Americans.  Who else would tell stories about Jack, Warren, and Henry Kissinger?  It ends in 1994, before his stroke and bizarre 10 day marriage to Catherine Oxenberg (and his highly medicore movies of the last 7 years or so); but that is nomatter.  You'll want to hang at Woodland with Evans by the end. You might even be using &quot;the kid stays in the picture&quot; as your own mantra.  Then again, maybe not.  Just find a copy and read it.	2001-05-30

It is not great literature. Some reviews seem to have taken this Ms. Wolper's debut too seriously.  It is not supposed to be James Joyce.  I love stories about Hollywood and Elizabeth West is a great character.  She is so different than most women I've seen in print.  She is a guy's gal.  The character's are nicely drawn, you care about them.  You really pull for Elizabeth.  I think some of the plot twists are easy to predict, but that doesn't detract from the story.  It is like Jake's Porsche--fast, fun, and worth the trip.  My only complaint is that I'm still not sure what made the character of Jake such a bad boy (it seems he was modeled on Don Simpson)--West tells you he is and that he sleeps with many women, but no other details are offered. I think some more Jake stories would have been fun.  Still, it is a fun and hilarious read.	2001-01-19

There are times I wonder at my own stupidity.  It was only as the year 2001 dawned that I began smarten up.  Why had I never read this book?  Got me.  Two my favorite books of recent vintage owed a debt to Wolfe (or mentioned him outright): Turn of the Century (Kurt Anderson) and Last Days of Disco (Whit Stillman).  I figured maybe it was time to read the Master himself.<br />I remember when Man in Full came out, it was as if George Washington himself had risen from the dead.  Who was this guy?  I consider myself quite well-educated, but it was time educate myself about Tom Wolfe.  I bought the paperback.<br />I just finished it.  I'm sad because the book ended.  I love anything about the '80s, but this book basically defined it.  The style is priceless as are the characters.  These characters, even the smaller ones, Abe Weiss, Miss Shelly Thomas, Arthur Ruskin among them, are fully formered.  The book is a true masterpiece. I knew it was a satire, but came to really care about these characters, winners and losers all of them.  When I took a step back I could see the brillance the names in this book, satirically speaking:  The author Nunnally Voyd, the law firm Dunning, Sponget, and Leach.  And on and on.  Peter Fallow.  I should stop here.  Readers should find out these treasures on their own.  The book is so great because it evokes a time not long ago yet now a memory.  Wolfe brings it life again.  It works at so many levels. Tragedy, farce, brillance... Don't be dumb like I was.  Just go read it.  You'll thank the true of Master of the Universe later.	2001-01-05

I had no idea what I would be getting (this was august) and it took me several months to get to it.  Any new Stillman project is like music to my ears (pardon the horrific pun).  He takes 4 years between movies and this was something new(ish).  <br />Stillman's movies have been compared to Woody Allen many times, notably by Roger Ebert.  While it is unlikely you will find a bigger Woody Allen fan than yours truely, I think the comparison is off the mark.  Perhaps they both deal with similar comedy of manners and city life, but Stillman is not Allen.  That is a good thing. Stillman, clearly influenced by many sources, is an original voice. <br />The other reviewers have done an outstanding job of explaining this extraordinary novel.  We all say, &quot;the book was better than movie&quot;  but when has a book been written after the film, by the screenwriter and turned into a novel that smoothly references the film?  Got me.  The book WAS better than the movie, but that is besides the point.<br />I watched the film (for the 3rd time) shortly before the I read the book.  While I found the actor's images in my mind, it also made the references to the movie much easier to recall.  They work best as companion pieces.  I loved getting to know Jimmy, a really good guy.  The book was moving and made me nostalgic for the early '80s when I was 6 or 7 and my own growing up years.  Stillman touched a nerve.  Even if you don't enjoy Stillman, you might enjoy the book.<br />By now, Stillman's signature style is well known.  Ingenious dialogue,confused, but good young people.  The film triliogy (Metropolitan remains the masterpiece) is now done, but what a way to end.  I loved this book so much.  This is not a very clear or literary review, but something about this book struck me very deeply.  Not since Nick Hornby has a writer struck me like this. I find myself thinking it over often and looking forward (as I often do with his films) to reading it again.<br />I particularly enjoyed hearing what had become the characters in the &quot;cocktails at the Petrossian&quot; and &quot;epilogue&quot; sections.  Fascinating revelations and lessons.  I wonder, what happened to Charlotte?  That we never know.  No matter.  <br />Poignant, hilarious, and fascinating.  Read it.  You will be changed.	2000-12-13

When it came out in paperback, I bought it and decided to give it a try.  I literally could not put it down.  The 659 pages was almost too short.  I could have read about George and Lizzie and LuLu and Sir (max) and Ben and Featherstone for another 1000.  These characters, while satirical are magical.  To inhabit their world is a gift.  <br />Andersen just &quot;gets&quot; it, his book is filled with media-saavy references (some will argue too many).  The more you know about the media, the more you will love it.  From Barbie World to MBC to The Casino Royale in NYC to 100 hilarious TV shows, it never ends.  It is interesting to see that some of the predictions he made have actually come true.  Many of Andersen's ideas aren't that crazy.<br />George is a terrific leading man.  Lizzie is a fascinating woman.  You learn to love them and their family.  Their friends, including Cubby, Featherstone, and Ben are my among my favorites, are spectular.  At it's core, this is a love story.  The story of George and Lizzie and all their luck and loss.  It is engrossing.<br />The last quarter of the book is all over the map, but it fits.  It is fun, surprising and even a bit moving.  This is our time, our places, our new century.  Entertainment Weekly was right in it's review, Andersen is the 1st great writer of the 3rd Millenium.  This book takes it place among my very favorite works.  <br />I can't wait to see what is next.  I raise my glass to Featherstone.	2000-09-21

While her profession is a  bit wacky (to say the least), I found the book's portrayals of young adult  life to be right on.  Ms. Sohn is able to capture something that eludes  many writers--the longing and sometimes sad days of being &quot;on your  own.&quot;  Most of all, I compliment Ms. Sohn on showing the  transformation (or compromises) that all recent college grads make up  living in the real world.

Even if you  are not much interested in the English language, you will never look at it  the same way again.  <br />I don't want to say much more about the plot, but I  will say that it is constantly riveting. At the end, I cried.  I'm not sure  why...perhaps, sadness or happiness or emotional exhaustion...perhaps, as  Tom would say, I'll never know.  <br />I do know you should order and read  this book immediately.

Wild's book is far above and beyond most books written on TV these days and  you will learn alot about the industry (and maybe miss Cupid again).  Wild  has done well, but I'm left wondering if he could have done a lot more.	1999-12-31

I grew up on John Hughes and ET.  Biskind's book, shows me just how wrong I was.  This extraordinary  book is a must read for any film fan.  Tons of gossip and some fairly  insightful film comments.  This book inspired me to dive deep into the  films of the period and has expanded my film horizons immensely.  While  Biskind at times seems to be more in love with his own turn of phrase than  his subject, that is a minor quibble.  The book is amazing.  Read it.  Take  it as film history and an object lesson.  You'll never look at Hollywood  the same way again.	1999-06-22

If you are at interested in TV or the entertainment business, this is the first book to read.  It is an extraordinary read.  It is a bit dated now, but don't let that deter you.  Auletta is an excellent writer and shows it  here.  It is long, but is as engrossing as any novel.  With apologies to  Bill Carter whose Late Shift is awesome, this is the 1 book to read if you  want to learn about TV.	1998-11-24

I loved the idea of this book.  I love TV and Owen is an outstanding TV  writer (for a good sample, read his column on-line).  The book has some  interesting ideas, but the book gets dull.  It breaks no new ground and  doesn't shed light on others.  I liked the fact that it wasn't steeped  in  the usual &quot;media criticism&quot;,  but there is no depth to much of  the book.  I think Owen will write a great book on TV one day...he just  isn't there yet.	1998-10-23

What could I, someone who graduated from private school in Chicago in 1992, learn from 1964?  I've never much cared for the 1960's.  After reading Greene's novel, All Summer Long, I went out and bought Be True to Your School.  The novel contained flashbacks to high school--Be True...contains the real stories.  In most ways, the power of Be True is even stronger than the novel because it was all true.  As many of the other reviewers have said, it rings true to high school.  I laughed, I cried, and I underlined the book.  It will stand among my favorite works.  Greene was a talented writer even at 17.  He poesses a very rare gift.  He has the ability to capture life's small moments and illuminate them. He celebrates their importance and makes no excuses for it--nor should he.  He finds wisdom in those youthful experiences.  He cherishes them.  That is the lesson I take from this book.  Too many people these days want to forget their teenage years and &quot;move on.&quot;  Greene teaches us that we will be forever shaped by those experiences, so we might as well celebrate them.  If we take their lessons and memories and keep them close to our hearts, we will not only be true to our schools, but true to ourselves.  As he does so often in his column, Greene shines again.	1998-07-06

It is witty and well written. You learn quickly that Benny Bloom is a character quite unlike any you have ever encountered.  The book is original and touching.  What will remain with me are the author's insights into the pain and loneliness that everyone Benny's age experiences.  And, ultimately, the soaring joy that hope of love and acceptance brings.  Even if you can't identify with her vocation, her inner life will touch you.	1998-06-15

Everett Weinberger must be commended on an excellent book.  It is a quick read, but that by no means it is one without much merit.  His odyssey through Hollywood reflects the craziest hopes of many readers.  His honesty, humor, and pursuit of his dreams are to be admired.  We certainly learn much about how Hollywood works.  As I look back, I see Weinberger as a lone man holding a flashlight to the darkness behind the bright illusions that Hollywood projects.  Even more, it is a diary of one man's ability to chase his dream and finally come to terms with where his life is headed.  His ability to accept his destiny (not one he had imagined when he headed to LA) in life and embrace it just may be the most valuable lesson his book teaches.	1998-01-13

I read the book in my early 20's felt a remarkable connection to these characters. There is a universal feel to many of the passages in this book. In particular, the images and memories of friendship and summers gone by, speak to anyone who has cherished memories of times gone by. The book is is both touching and hilarious. It is the perfect read; summer, fall, winter, or spring. This novel among the very best I have ever read. My copy is all underlined--just as I used to do in school--this time, though, it is for the pure enjoyment of it. This is an example of Greene at his very best--his sentimental side. Greene often uses his pen these days to fight injustices in this country, so this is a treasure of a Greene from days gone by (and one we don't see so much anymore).	1997-06-02
