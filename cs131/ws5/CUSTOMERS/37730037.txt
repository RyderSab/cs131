Hence, the subjects vary as widely as do the writers' niches within the \\"recurring spirit of revolt and reform\\" that is found to emerge. There are landscapes, such as Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow, Willa Cather's Nebraska plains, and Robinson Jeffer's Pacific seacoast; urban domains such as Ben Franklin's cobblestone Philadelphia, Dos Passos' Gotham skyline, Ring Lardner's tropical Grand Hotel, and Sandburg's Chicago stockyards; small town vignettes including New England farmsteads, Midwest general stores, and various country inns, mills, and \\"great houses\\"; and such psychic interpolations as John Steinbeck's long road, Sinclair Lewis' hypocritical Main Street, and all too many authors' derelicts, shanties and ruins.     Regardless of subject, the compositions evince an expert eye and sympathetic heart. Even Thoreau's famous pond is freshly interpreted as a dawn study in receding shadow and rising mist. The shots taken from Emily Dickinson's bedroom window, or along an ancient sunken stretch of Mississippi's legendary Natchez Trace highroad, are alone worth the book's modest aftermarket price.     Production values are high in this 50's era Dodd Mead, BOTM Club Dividend publication: heavy, glossy paper only slightly browning with age does justice to the full tonal range of the superbly composed images. Many of the shots (Wolfe's Asheville; Twain's Virginia City) have themselves become historically significant records of a \\"today\\" long since replaced by much more of considerably less.     The \\"concise biographical material\\" on the writers whose worlds the 179 photos depict is designed to \\"place [them] in the unfolding literary scene\\" beginning with Captain John Smith over 300 years beforehand, and continuing through 1952 with mention of the \\"promising\\" newcomer, Eudora Welty.     The mostly black dust jacket ties it all together with a mythic aerial shot of a 19th century steamboat \\"Headed south, below Memphis\\" on a gloriously golden-hued stretch of Mark Twain's beloved Old Muddy.     Many of these writers are no longer considered major, if they ever were. No matter - they fill out an American panorama, and their stories, and the hauntingly atmospheric images that interpret them, are worth returning to again and again, for something that goes a bit beyond mere nostalgia, I think. Or if not, then as broadly American a nostalgia as we can realistically hope for, at least through a survey of our literary heritage....	2005-08-20

Having not just read this book but personally experienced the transpersonal energy of this rare example of authentically lived higher consciousness, I was a bit dismayed at the one shallow, ignorant and disrespectful review below.      Take it from someone who has gone to considerable lengths to be around seven of the most famous Self-realized spiritual luminaries in the world, including Shree Maa: this one, like any authentic mahatma (\\"Great Soul\\"), is capable of effortlessly elevating anyone around her to a variety of exalted states at will.  Definitely worth reading about, Shree Maa is far better to actually meet up with -- if you can find her!      P.S.  In addition to being a spiritual powerhouse on subtle planes, Shree Maa is (even at her current age) a truly incomparable singer of devotional music -- most notably the works composed by the divinely intoxicated Ramprasad, an early member of Shree Maa's lineage.      Her CD of his songs (\\"Songs Of Ramprasad\\") is a remarkable expression of deep feeling and vocal virtuosity.  Literally flawless from beginning to end, songs from this collection have been known to \\"melt rocks\\", i.e. the hardened hearts of cynical and benighted souls who happen to hear even a few moments of them.      If you want to know what the transported St. Theresa was experiencing while the smiling angel was piercing her heart with an arrow in the famous Bernini sculpture, get thine hands on this inimitable performance (which is not currently carried new by Amazon, but do check occasionally for a bargain used one)....    P.P.S. For background on a *far* more accessible \\"Mother Divine\\" embodiment, do read \\"Amma: Healing the Heart of the World\\", Amazon/ISBN # 0-68817079X, as well as any of the other books about her, many available used as well as new through Amazon.  Amma (the so-called \\"hugging saint\\") is another authentic spiritual powerhouse, with her own inimitable flavor of Divine Mother energy -- and this one travels!!    P.P.P.S. The divinely beautiful young woman on the cover of Linda Johnsen's \\"Daughters of the Goddess: The Women Saints of India\\"  (ISBN # 0-93666309X) is none other than Shree Maa!  It's well worth acquiring this title for the chapter on her alone; as a bonus, it also contains one on Amma....	2005-08-20

This is a sweet gem of a mini-coffee-table (old tea table?) book by the master of American folkways historianship and illustration (young Sloane crossed the country from New England to Taos and parts West in a Model T Ford in the 1920's, as an itinerant sign painter!).      The Do's are mostly old-time practical household how-tos; the Don'ts, amazing retro social customs and taboos, many of which will raise a smile -- or elicit a squirm -- from the modern reader.

I can't believe I'm the first to review this hysterical classic literary misfit title.  Its dyspeptic WW I-wounded author tells eleven stories of people whose careers embodied a common and classic theme: 1) inordinate success; 2) consequent hubris (i.e., ego-appropriation of the grace of the \\"Gods\\" of karma); 3) catastrophic collapse, as the Gods desert the irreverent ingrate.  Interesting stories all, though not exactly world-beating literature.    Then he limns the saga of the amazing legend-in-his-own-lifetime Charles XII, of politically inconsequential early Sweden.  This chapter alone makes the book a prime candidate for \\"cult classic\\" status.      Charles had an early and utter conviction of his impending date with destiny, and consciously fashioned himself after a pseudo-historical caricature of Alexander the Great.  Much as those deeply devoted but culturally clueless early Russian Christians managed to build (in wood, yet) copies of fantastic \\"Greek churches\\" invented by Mediterranean painters but never actually constructed by anyone, so Charles managed to pull off his outrageous personal omnipotence and invincibility fantasies against overwhelming odds.  Until....    I won't spoil the abrupt ending.  Suffice it to say, I laughed out loud more than once reading this brief but wickedly wry account.      The only military history I know of that comes at all close for humor was my ROTC text's remarkably unbiased military history of the invasion of Cuba during the Spanish American War.  But whereas that story was laughable due to the U.S. forces' pervasive incompetence (e.g., horses pushed off the landing boats promptly started swimming out to sea), Charles' idyll -- at one point he actually launched a \\"punitive expedition\\" against Peter the Great of Russia! -- is fall-down funny due to the absolute incongruity of his preposterous success, given what he had to work with.      This title is a steal, especially in the 1929 hardback edition -- but not after the first dozen readers of this review gobble them up.  If you don't laugh out loud reading the Charles chapter, I'll buy the book from you, as a Christmas gift for a friend in need of a hoot or three....	2005-06-10

Or series of same, to be both brief and precise.  It's been so long since I read college Faulkner that I can't remember a shred (skein?) of it, but who would be so dyspeptic as to argue that either absurdist humor or bathroom reading are unworthy literary categories -- let alone a genre that combines both?    More to the point: sure, the best single way to learn about style is to read and re-read the great stylists, and so come to grok both the breadth of their differences and the depth of their similarities, and thereby enliven a sense of the space of possibilities for human expression -- both to enhance appreciation of each writer's uniquely in-formed and informing \\"flavor\\", and to articulate within oneself a \\"framing space\\" for placing (and perchance assessing) the perspectives and technical accomplishments of future writers (yikes -- this style parody stuff is corrupting!).    But reading skillful parody *does* add an undeniable dimension to this enrichment process, by shining a light on the nature of style as such.  I recently read selections from some book or other of multi-author parodies (I think it was one of those \\"an education in a book\\" titles), and was amazed at how deft they were, at how incapable I would have been to produce such eloquent verbal portraiture -- distorted as in a fun house mirror, but in spite of this (or because of it) so revealing, in terms of elements as subtle as \\"tone\\" and \\"voice\\".    Interestingly enough, I may have learned more from the parodies of the authors I hadn't read than of those I had.  This says something on an intensely fashionable \\"meta\\" level about something or other involving mind, language and Being, but, existential self-referentiality being as ineffable as the ineffability of Being itself, I'll have to be excused from articulating it.    ANYway, what the heck -- why not triangulate on these fascinating aspects of literary form?  Compare authors with each other, compare them with their respective parodies to sharpen your eye and ear, compare parodies with each other (and do a little theoretical reading on the subject, perhaps) to gain a sense of the stylistic (meta-stylistic?) \\"vocabulary\\" or meta-same of literary burlesque -- and by extension (or inversion, or un-perversion, or pre-version -- SOMEbody's version), of the root-level resources of language itself...    P.S.  There's a whole subfield of Vedic philosophy dedicated to the analysis of modes of learning from analogies by examining where and how they fail; isn't there an analogy here to the fruits of study of parodies, precisely in terms of their failings as precise metaphors?  If so, only the finest products will do for such analyses -- unless they become SO fine as expressions of the authors' sensibilities that it becomes a looking-glass proposition as to which \\"authorless text\\" be considered the \\"original\\" and which the \\"'parody'\\".   Even then we might learn something, though it might well be limited to which hemisphere of our brain looks better in a mirror, versus in real life...	2005-03-25

I can't believe that I'm the first one in thirteen years to review this magnificent book!      It's at once a visual delight, a psychological and art-interpretive education, and a deeply touching look into the tender and sincere hearts of the young.      It's also a surprisingly potent means of reconnecting to our own largely forgotten early years; I shed more than a few tears on reading the stories of some of these earnest young souls' pictures and lives.      The selected images aren't always great art (though many are quite beautiful and even gripping, e.g. the Israeli boy's drawing of God's \\"power\\" separating darkness from light).  Those that aren't visually sophisticated, though, can be appreciated through Coles' eloquent sensibility as brilliantly effective communicators of meaning.      Coles has made for himself a remarkable career, traveling internationally to investigate children under a wide variety of circumstances: children of Eskimos, of the Appalachians, children integrating Southern schools, those entangled with war, illness, or family crisis, as well as those of the affluent.      The result is remarkable and profound -- children seen as \\"budding visionaries, an early version of the essence of what we turn out to be as human beings.\\"    Just reading a few of the stories concerning the religious paintings has greatly expanded my empathy for religion (from which I was alienated as a child), and for the delicate inner heart of everyone.  I'm going to be reading Coles' three other and apparently more famous books very soon -- The \\"Moral/Political/Spiritual Life Of Children\\" series, starting with the last.      Also, do read the Product Description of Coles' \\"Children Of Crisis\\" (also unreviewed!) -- ISBN 0316151025 -- it is brief but powerful, and comprehensive of the abovementioned books as well.	2005-03-18

I was amazed by the polarity of the reviews for this book -- always a good sign, as long as the lengthier reviews are the negative ones.  Having bought a copy for resale, the reviews below motivated me to heavily skim it, and here's the fat skinny as I see it.    These guys really are gifted professionals, whose approach melds formal principle with intuitive insight.  Their advice taken piecemeal may read like mostly conventional wisdom, but there is a LOT of it packed into a small space.  And their bemoaned \\"writing about themselves\\" (hard to avoid, really) is how you get the Be-Here-Now feel of their process.  This personal, casebook approach adds considerable vitality to the link between the layered and revealing text and the superbly composed interior photos.     No, the latter are NOT huge -- discernment is a mark of these designers, and the medium is as much the message here as with the design examples and text.  The real learning comes Zen-like, in the space between the words and images -- that's why some readers \\"get it\\" and others (who tend to want concrete \\"how to\\" or big, flashy pix and divertingly original text) don't.  Check out a library copy if you're in doubt as to whether you're this book's kind of person.  Or just take the plunge, get humble and patient, and see what -- and how -- you can learn....    On the text: sure, we all know that the floor is the foundation of any room, furniture should be suitable, luxurious bathrooms will pamper you, wall surfaces offer lots of possibilities, and colors should harmonize but need not match.  But then you come upon nuggets of concentrated utility, like their three (primordial) strategies for the use of color, and such interesting observations as, \\"When color is integral to the material -- stone, wood, metal -- it registers less strongly\\".      The authors' offbeat perspective surfaces here and there like a thread in a tapestry.  They liken the floor to the \\"face\\" of a room -- then survey ten classic flooringmaterials in a sentence, list eight functions that floor designs can serve in two more, and rattle off a dozen points of practical wisdom about carpets --   all this being reflected in the accompanying pictures.  You don't read this book so much as you mine it.    The use of many transitional pages with nothing but large-scripted aphorisms and chapter titles IS a tad on the indulgent side, but even here the whole can be more than the sum of the parts.  \\"A room's function should be paramount in determining the way it looks\\" (4: Living in a Room), yet \\"The more defined a room's function is, the harder it can be to design\\" (8: Functional Spaces).  \\"Be Here Now\\", gentle acolytes -- these dividers are really connectors as well, functioning on the rebound as subsumers of more practical wisdom than is apparent until you've done your homework.  Read that text and get your eyeballs into those pix for a couple of iterations, grok the \\"tell `em then show `em\\" paradigm in play, and go to school on these guys!    In sum, \\"editing, function and order\\" are as masterfully displayed in every aspect of the layout as they are demonstrated to be essential to the design of a room.  The book is multi-dimensionally gorgeous, inside and out -- quite the bonus, really (check out the super-classic \\"Billy Baldwin Decorates\\" by way of comparison, and see what I mean).  You can display this coffee table gem with pride, for its fascinating Persian-Miniature style photos, discussion-provoking koan/cliches, sheer textural delight to the eye and hand, and for the delectation of your subtler friends....	2005-03-05

As an insatiable devourer of antebellum studies, I heartily concur with Mr. Diffey's comments below concerning this astute, if somewhat textually dense, socio-political analysis the Old South.  Only W. J. Cash's seminal \\"Mind of the South\\"; the superbly myth-busting \\"The Southern Agrarians\\" by Conkin; Blassingame's  somber and sobering \\"The Slave Community\\"; and Wyatt-Brown's indispensable capstone study \\"Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South\\" are in the same league, in my estimation.       As a systems analyst, moreover, I'd like to share my appreciation for a valuable lesson this book offers to anyone attempting to construct or evaluate a \\"factor analysis\\" of historical events, or any other complex dynamics.      There's a principle in cognitive/systems theory to the effect that the all-too-finite human mind can contain only so many discrete concepts at once -- the number is classically stated as \\"seven, plus or minus two\\".  Look at a random batch of examples of visually displayed information, for example, and you'll find yourself boggling over any of them with more than 7-9 boxes, symbols, or whatever, to be considered as an integrated whole.    Ford's book is instructive because he posits about seven factors (as I recall, plus or minus one), as each being necessary for the rise of the uniquely radical tenor of South Carolinian politics in the antebellum era.  He reviews other analyst's attempts to do with various combinations of three or four of these factors (the one-party system, Calhoun's overwhelming personality, etc.), but manages to argue convincingly that no less than the whole lot were crucial -- the absence of any one of them would have vitiated the collective dynamic which led to the South Carolinians' intransigence, even by the other Southern states' standards, and their initiatory secession.      The appreciative reader has to both salute Mr. Ford on his masterly delineation of the key factors and their interactions, and wonder whether anyone could pull off a convincing resolution of a complex issue employing very many more factors than those required here.      In any case, the book is a tour-de-force in the art and science of reducing amorphous data to concrete elements of an overall pattern, as well as a potentially sobering object lesson on the outer limits of intelligibility/communicability confronting anyone considering the pursuit of a similar objective.      P.S.  \\"The Japanese Mind\\", by the dauntingly accomplished R. C. Christopher, achieves a correspondingly complex feat with regard to Japanese culture, and is highly recommended -- as are \\"Fragile Glory\\" by Bernstein, for anyone wanting to understand the dual (and dueling) nations of France and Paris, and Luigi Barzini's \\"The Italians\\", for similar gratification on that national/cultural front.  On the U.S. socio-cultural scene, do read Aldrich's \\"Old Money: The Mythology of Wealth In America\\", for all that's essential to and fascinating about this rarefied, hyper-enfranchised  psychosocial stratum....	2004-03-25

I regret not being able to fully delineate these myths (one had to do with the South being almost exclusively agricultural and likely to stay that way; another had to do with the distribution of slaves and power, as I recall).  You are cordially invited to make up for my lack of a \\"due diligence\\" timely re-read, and just delight firsthand in the expose' of these myths, through the debunking of many of the presumptive posturings of a constellation of self-important lit-cha-cha types who subsequently deserted their beloved region -- and Regionalism -- to scamper North and create the (also doomed) New Criticism.      The book is an absorbing read and a real education -- exactly the sort of unbiased, data-driven nostrum that mis-enculturated NeoRebs just can't cotton to swallowing, as we Yankees are given to understand the matter (via such public spectacles as the puerile-or-worse Rebel Battle Flag issue over certain State House domes; the universal honoring of big-time slave owners as great public role models; the perpetual polishing of the innumerable monuments to the \\"Great Unnamed Cause\\" (a.k.a. the White Supremacist-Based Slave State); etc.).    A milder formulation of Old South realities, acceptable to all, is to be found in \\"Origins of Southern Radicalism: The South Carolina Upcountry, 1800-1860\\" by Lacy K. Ford, also highly recommended as a magnificent analysis of about seven interrelated factors individually and collectively crucial to South Carolinian political exceptionalism in the antebellum era.      In between somewhere is W. J. Cash's seminal \\"The Mind Of The South\\".  Hard reading for many of his fellow Southerners, this book will unstick the scales from your eyes as well as anything in print (unless even the raw emotional impact of \\"The Slave Community\\" by Blassingame fails to do the trick, and the pressing economic issue of immanent exportation of slave labor wages from South to North, via the international marketplace for manufactured goods, needs to be dragged in -- nemmine those mangy, hypocritical Abolitionists!).    It's regrettable to have to point this out to so many trusting (white) souls indoctrinated south of the Mason-Dixon line, but the psycho-socio-econo-politico-moral interpretation of Southern antebellum society is neither a matter of sovereign personal preference nor an appropriate venue for the display of family loyalties.  As V. S. Naipal witheringly summed it up in his great 3-part \\"The South\\" New Yorker magazine survey article: Why can't these latter-day partisans of the \\"Great Unnamed Cause\\" (Naipal's phrase) understand that their forebears \\"fought for nothing more than that which they knew?\\"    But I rant.  Anyway, DO read this fascinating study by Conkin, and get inside the dynamics of a South that many would just as soon believe didn't and couldn't exist -- and inside the psyches of the writers who, for a time at least, tried to glorify a stereotype of a vanished era under the rubric \\"Southern Regionalism\\"....	2004-03-25

What a uniquely valuable photo-documentary!  Hundreds of high-quality b&w photos (plus 4 in nice Polaroid-transfer style color) of (mostly) Liberian (mostly) dwellings, from proud to humble, including interiors and details.  Also some shots of the Southern U.S. 19th-century exemplars that the return immigrants  remembered living in and (mostly) around, and served as the basis of an eclectic architectural vernacular.  Also included are some floor plans, and a number of sensitive portraits of current residents (evidently descendants of the original builders in most cases).    I haven't read the text yet, but the pix are absolutely stunning.  The vernacular is as unique as in many of the tropical islands and other mythic locations, but in addition, given the status of the builders as culturally twice-displaced persons, you can feel the struggle and the aspirations of these newly (and genuinely) freed people.    Now for the doubly poignant part: would these folks have stayed in the U.S. had they known what wholesale tragedy was eventually going to overwhelm their new homeland?  That's anyone's guess, but we can't help feeling a tug at the heartstrings, what with the shocking reports out of contemporary Liberia (ongoing events had reduced many of the dwellings to shambles, a la Mauritius, even in 1988; we can only imagine their condition in the wake of all the current horrors).    This book is an absolute must for any African American library, architectural eclectic library, African cultural library, gorgeously-produced historical photo library.  Slide it on your shelf, and give it some companionship by way of the African/world adobe book \\"Spectacular Vernacular\\" by Bourgeois and Davidson, and the delectable \\"Living In Mauritius\\" by De Marigny and Lagesse.  Both are superb complements to this invaluable study of the artistic and cultural richness of African/American/African vernacular architecture.	2004-03-23

This is the lavishly produced catalog for the impressive one-time, one-venue 1998 show of the same name at the Mississippi Arts Pavilion, in Jackson.  The 225-page, 9x12 inch format heavy card-cover tome begins with outside and inside views of the major rooms of Versailles, mostly full-page size, then focuses on shots of the 120+ artifacts and installations included in that ambitious show.    The Mississippi Commission on International Cultural Exchange  did a 1996 one-venue show on Russian Imperial Style that broke U.S. exhibition attendance records -- those folks do great work, and this show's catalog reflects it.  Printed on heavy gloss paper in superb color, it includes well-selected paintings, tapestries, porcelains, the king's bedchamber installation, and the controversial 10-ton equestrian statue by Bernini.    This is a superb coffee table book, especially for the remarkably low (as of this writing) aftermarket price.  I'm not familiar with the other extant Versailles books, but this one looks like a must-add to any enthusiast's collection.  It would be in much higher demand -- and fetch higher prices -- if it weren't a show catalog, and hence not as well known as it might be.  A royal sleeper!	2004-02-01

Over the course of a few too many years I have acquired a 3-foot stack of classic books on wealth, status and power in America, and this is both the latest addition and the undisputed spiritual (!) capstone of the collection.  \\"Rich and nuanced\\" is how I would characterize Mr. Aldrich's comprehensive assessment of the phenomenon of inherited wealth and established social class in the land of the American Dream.  Mythic stuff indeed (it was this word that compelled me to buy the book) -- and Aldrich's background and skills are more than up to the challenge of rendering it, in all its paradox, consternation and complexity, for the genuinely interested reader.<br /><br />The brief panning reviews below mystified me as well as they did the other reviewer.  Aldrich starts out not with anything construable as a \\"justification\\", but rather with a withering indictment of the source of his family's wealth -- in itself a mini-education in the dynamics of 19th century pork barrel politics. Aldrich's book is both a sort of personal exorcism of family demons that others would just as soon whitewash and preen themselves over, and a subtle and multi-dimensional account of a great many interrelated issues surrounding the institution of inherited wealth and privilege, and its effect on those both inside and outside the golden pale.<br /><br />\\"Reasoned\\" and \\"balanced\\" are two other adjectives that suggest themselves with regard to the book's overall project.  Outsiders may resent his occasional displays of sympathy for his motley compatriots in hyper-enfranchisement, but you'll have to search elsewhere (e.g. the better-written WASP Supremacy diatribes) for the \\"our shortcomings are colorful foibles, theirs are hideous crimes\\" pathology that afflicts the smug somnambulists of the Far Right.<br /><br />True, Aldrich hasn't climaxed his public catharsis by giving away his patrimony (though I'd be surprised if he hasn't been more than usually financially generous in all the right directions); but anyone accusing him of a lack of noblesse oblige is just being perverse or uncomprehending regarding the general thrust and intention of this eminently worthwhile read.<br /><br />In the author's defense, I can only suggest that the one virtually unassailable self-justification for Establishment predations -- \\"If it weren't us on top, it would inevitably be others, and probably the more harsh for lack of experience\\" -- is rendered just a bit less disconcerting by the occasional production of a gentleman as truly humane, culturally enriching, and deeply entertaining as Mr. Aldrich.<br /><br />As for the alleged elitist style: I too lack basic French, and tend to resent its use in expository prose.  But \\"blipping over\\" a phrase here and there doesn't usually harm the overall sense of a well-heeled writer's material; and a modicum of humility obliges any reader to make an effort to step outside himself and honor the sensibilities of the more accomplished.<br /><br />In this and other matters of vocabulary, would the disgruntled reviewer below prefer Aldrich to write down to him?  Given the hazards of such behavior's leading to intellectual patronization or worse (i.e., just plain lazy thinking and/or exposition), I'll take the occasional mini-slight to my natural dignity as an untutored reader -- there are dictionaries, after all -- and accept my cultural patrimony whole and unblighted by stylistic censorship.<br /><br />The comment below about most writers on this topic being outsiders is well taken.  \\"Old Money\\" lacks Ferdinand Lundberg's statistically-fuelled rantings, and stops a bit short of fellow outsider Veblen's ironic savaging of the cultural degeneracies of endemic privilege.  Its richly nuanced approach is due no less to Aldrich's insider status than to his exceptional observational, analytic and descriptive powers, and the present reviewer is grateful for the synergy.<br /><br />For those interested in the roots and mechanisms of wealth-as-power, Lundberg's trenchant \\"The Rich and the Super Rich\\" is irreplaceable; Epstein's and Fussel's mordant depictions of the invidious lifestyle are both entertaining and informative; and the other dozen-odd major authors are sources of endlessly varied morsels of cocktail party erudition.  But no one ties it all together in as many different ways at once as Aldrich.  Read him first, instead of last as I did, and avail yourself of an impeccable standard of value for any other study on this topic that you're likely to find.s irreplaceable; Epstein's and Fussel's mordant depictions of the invidious lifestyle are both entertaining and informative; and the other dozen-odd major authors are sources of endlessly varied morsels of cocktail party erudition.

Why the earlier reviewer found this work off-track, so to speak (it is after all a Smithsonian ethnographic study), is a mystery to me.

This is the biggest-ever collection of what every golfer has probably seen one or two of -- hoked-up images of world famous geographic landmarks with a tee, an impossible-to-reach green, and maybe some scant \\"fair\\"way resources superimposed on them.  Locales include the American West, various well known mountains, tropical paradises-turned-hellholes, and an extensive sampling of Australian natural wonders.<br /><br />A few examples suffice to give you the birds-eye lowdown on this caper. Ever hear of a 635-yard Par 2? (Hint: it's down a major waterfall.)  How about a 660-yard Par 5 -- but along the face of the Eiger?  Or, for something a bit more realistic, an immaculate, if challenging, 440-yard Par 4 along the top of the Great Wall of China?  Other sites include Delicate Arch, Stonehenge, Ayres Rock, Krakatoa Island, and the Sphinx.<br /><br />Accompanying notes on \\"local club\\" history are episodically brief but consistently droll.  The holes' nicknames are, in general, wryly appropriate; a par on any one of them (except perhaps the waterfall hole) would qualify the player for Mount Olympus -- a site curiously omitted from the itinerary.<br /><br />I seem to recall the original edition of this work, published decades ago, as having included only 18 holes.  At four times the length, this is an underpriced gem of a gift book for the avid golfer, for anyone who's ever swung a golf club, or for the non-golfer with a weakness for the visually absurd.  Beautiful (if not invariably crisp) full-page-sized color photos make you count your blessings, and/or plan your next vacation.  FORE!!!	2003-05-16

This book's fury-driven introductory essay makes many superb points about what we're doing (okay, what we've done - the book was published in 1964) to our landscape, or rather are continuing to allow to be done by soulless \\"business is business\\" types in our devil-take-the-hindmost cultural melee.      The 130+ b&w photos are stunning, in the best and worst senses of the word -- and not unmixed with nostalgia, as we note the smallish herds of 50's cars in situ, and realize that many of the \\"ravaged\\" sites shown are now viewable as nostalgia sets, compared with what came along in the  decades that followed.      A great visual treat (if you take your Tums), and a source of some interesting cultural perspectives (e.g., the story of the Seagram Building's lost \\"prestige tax\\" court battle).

What's the problem with the first two reviewers??!!  This comprehensively scoped book is written by a distinguished author about a major topic in English -- And American -- history (the reason colonial-era New England acquired so many buildings, humble as well as grand, of unusual beauty is due to widespread use of the London rebuilding guides, authored by major architects and shipped to the boonies after the reconstruction era ended).    Sure, two thirds of the book's six chapters are about subsequent events, after a chapter on \\"Dangers and Precautions\\" and one on the Great Fire proper (how long, after all, can anyone go on describing a fire -- any fire?).  These latter four chapters include: \\"Taking Stock\\"; \\"Preparations for Rebuilding\\"; \\"The Rebuilding\\"; and \\"Aftermath\\".  The lattermost surveys such issues as the evolution of town planning, evolving building styles, and fire prevention precautions in both the capital and provincial towns.    There are lots of well chosen and reproduced illustrations and diagrams, and an extensive bibliography; the shiny, mylar-covered boards are even printed like the colorful dust jacket.

If you don't know about this famous book by the inimitable Walton, you have a lot to look forward to. Purporting to be an account of a 5-day fishing idyll (when gentlemen were gentle men, and the English countryside was at once bountiful and near to hand), it is in fact a deeply engaging nostalgia trip into a never-never land of pastoral bliss -- an enduring cult classic having no exact parallel in world literature.<br /><br />To say \\"evocative of simpler, happier times\\" is to barely hint at the near-mystical fragrance of this enchanting volume. Three high-spirited protagonists (\\"Piscator\\", \\"Venator\\", and \\"Auceps\\"), devoted to three rival outdoor avocations (fishing, hunting, and falconing, respectively), meet on a \\"fine, fresh May morning\\"; ramble across the countryside in search of lively fishing and hearty times; sing, banter, and versify; recount ancient wisdom (of often dubious validity) regarding the habits and temper of over a dozen local fish species; and encounter a classic sampling of innkeepers, milkmaids, gypsies, and various other idealized rural types. This is a refuge book for quiet evenings, one of those unaccountably transporting narratives of which no charmed reader has ever wanted to reach the end.<br /><br />Some history: stolen in parts from precedents written as far back as 1450, Walton's work is nearly as early as it could be and still be readable without a line-by-line explanatory gloss (\\"compleat\\" is about as arcane as it gets). First published in 1653, there have been well over 100 editions in print. Some of the earlier ones contain Lang's sensitive and informative 28-page introduction to the author's life, the structure of the work, and its publishing history. Noteworthy are the 80+ illustrations produced by Sullivan (again, available in some of the older editions and their reprints), which are unselfconsciously exquisite: naively rendered country scenes and character sketches; finely wrought studies of dry flies and of the various species of fish mentioned in the book; and ornately framed images of famous fishermen \\"taken\\" from the evidently superb engraved portraits of Major's 1824 edition.<br /><br />The author was a minor legend in his own time. Held in the highest regard by all who knew him, this \\"excellent old man\\" suffered many tragedies throughout his long life (from the public murder of his beloved king to various family deaths and personal debilities), but he never lost his rare sweetness of temper.

To summarize our earlier review, this is one of the most comprehensively educational works we've ever come across.    We'd wanted to include the full dust jacket blurb for the 1978 1st Edition, ahead of its complete 3-Volume Topics List, as an additional public service (since Amazon doesn't happen to display an editorial review for these scarce but valuable works) -- but we were concerned about exceeding our 1,000 word limit.      So, here it is as a supplement (again, we'd like to REQUEST A COMPARATIVE REVIEW from anyone familiar with the additions and changes incorporated into the 12/2001 2nd Edition; diplomats and/or scholars, please pass this along):     ------------------------------    \\"The Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy is a selective reference work containing specially commissioned essays that explore concepts, themes, doctrines, and distinctive policies in the history of American foreign relations. The essays range in coverage from broad concepts such as isolationism and national self-determination to specific topics such as the Monroe Doctrine and the China Lobby.     This topical approach presents to serious readers - students, academicians, government officials, journalists, politicians, and the interested layman - an authoritative compendium of essays that analyze the development, application, and meaning of basic concepts in foreign policy.     The ninety-five essays in this volume are all based on the most recent scholarship, and many of them deal with topics that have not previously been the subject of consistent investigation and systematic analysis. Even in those essays that deal with material that has received considerable scholarly attention, the authors offer original syntheses and interpretations. All topics are discussed within a meaningful historical context and in a manner not available elsewhere.     The authors were not required to adhere to any standard methodology or ideological model. Among the foremost scholars in their respective fields, they have written with complete freedom. The result is not the conventional chronological account of American foreign policy but wide-ranging discussions that cover a broad political spectrum, from Left to Right.     The Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy: Studies of the Principal Movements and Ideas reflects the importance of American foreign policy in the contemporary world. It is a comprehensive survey of thoughtful analyses, which enriches and clarifies foreign policy and the concepts and rhetoric associated with it. It is an undertaking unique in the historiography of American foreign relations.\\"	2002-03-03

Hence, the subjects vary as widely as do the writers' niches within the \\"recurring spirit of revolt and reform\\" that is found to emerge.  There are landscapes, such as Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow, Willa Cather's Nebraska plains, and Robinson Jeffer's Pacific seacoast; urban domains such as Ben Franklin's cobblestone Philadelphia, Dos Passos' Gotham skyline, Ring Lardner's tropical Grand Hotel, and Sandburg's Chicago stockyards; small town vignettes including New England farmsteads, Midwest general stores, and various country inns, mills, and \\"great houses\\"; and such psychic interpolations as John Steinbeck's long road, Sinclair Lewis' hypocritical Main Street, and all too many authors' derelicts, shanties and ruins.      Regardless of subject, the compositions evince an expert eye and sympathetic heart.  Even Thoreau's famous pond is freshly interpreted as a dawn study in receding shadow and rising mist.  The shots taken from Emily Dickinson's bedroom window, or along an ancient sunken stretch of Mississippi's legendary Natchez Trace highroad, are alone worth the book's modest aftermarket price.    Production values are high in this 50's era Dodd Mead, BOTM Club Dividend publication: heavy, glossy paper only slightly browning with age does justice to the full tonal range of the superbly composed images.  Many of the shots (Wolfe's Asheville; Twain's Virginia City) have themselves become historically significant records of a \\"today\\" long since replaced by much more of considerably less.      The \\"concise biographical material\\" on the writers whose worlds the 179 photos depict is designed to \\"place [them] in the unfolding literary scene\\" beginning with Captain John Smith over 300 years beforehand, and continuing through 1952 with mention of the \\"promising\\" newcomer, Eudora Welty.      The mostly black dust jacket ties it all together with a mythic aerial shot of a 19th century steamboat \\"Headed south, below Memphis\\" on a gloriously golden-hued stretch of Mark Twain's beloved Old Muddy.    Many of these writers are no longer considered major, if they ever were.  No matter -- they fill out an American panorama, and their stories, and the hauntingly atmospheric images that interpret them, are worth returning to again and again, for something that goes a bit beyond mere nostalgia, I think.  Or if not, then as broadly American a nostalgia as we can realistically hope for, at least through a survey of our literary heritage....	2002-02-12
