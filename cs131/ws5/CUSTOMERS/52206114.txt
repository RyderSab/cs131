This course is just awful.  The packaging says \\"At the completion of this course, you will be able to speak and understand Spanish at an advanced level\\".  But this is not true at all.  The main focus of this 10-unit course is on conversations related to the publishing industry.  There are many words that you are asked to repeat, which were already introduced in the Pimsleur beginner-level courses.  How many times do you need to repeat \\"Vivo en Estados Unidos\\" before you understand it?  Also, I can't imagine why the designers of this course think it's useful, at an advanced level (or any level for that matter), to repeat place names such as \\"Montevideo, Uruguay\\" using a Spanish accent.  This course may give you the opportunity to practice some of the Spanish you've already learned in earlier courses, but you will learn very little that's useful in the real world, unless you're planning to become an editor, or to write and publish a novel.	2004-08-31

This cost is for the CDs; they also rent the audio cassette version.<br />This course was at just the right level for me.  The first few lessons have quite a bit of repetition in them, which is good if you've never learned any Spanish at all, like me.  As the lessons progress, and you are more comfortable with it, it's not quite as repetitive, and the course throws a lot more words at you in each lesson.  This worked out well for me.  Sometimes, I had to listen to a lesson a second time.  Each lesson is 30 minutes long, and if you rent part A of Spanish I, then you're getting 7 CDs, each with two lessons, plus an instruction manual on a separate CD, and a 'reading book' on CD.	2004-02-12

She meets up with a mysterious man named Adoni Cane who has no memory of his past, who is found later to be a genetically-enhanced super-soldier.  The ship she is travelling on is ambushed and destroyed by the Dato Bloc, a government that has broken away from the COE.  With the help of the AI known as &quot;The Box&quot;, and the warrior Adoni Cane, she escapes the destruction of the ship and crash-lands on the prison planet Sciacca's World.  From there, the rest of the book chronicles her mission to escape the planet and return the AI to COE Intelligence HQ, while constantly on the run from Dato Bloc forces, who are in league with the corrupt COE officials on the planet.<br />If I could give this book a 3.5 star rating, I would.  It's good but not great, and as another reviewer said, it doesn't have a lot of original ideas.  If you like a space opera type of story with a good deal of action, you'll like this book.  My problems with it were the cliches of the &quot;all-powerful AI&quot; and the &quot;mysterious warrior&quot;.  In every dangerous situation that Commander Roche faces, it's either Adoni Cane or The Box that pulls her out of it, through some kind of trick or previously unknown ability.  After a while, it starts to read like an episode of one of the newer Star Trek shows, where the characters are put in seemingly impossible situations, but are really not in very much danger at all, because it becomes obvious that either Cane or The Box will always come through and save her.<br />The ending of the book, especially for the first in a trilogy, was a little too much of a &quot;happy ending&quot; for me.  Usually, at this point in a story, there should be a certain level of tension that is worked through in the second book, and then ultimately resolved in the third book.  The reader is not left with a lot to look forward to in the next installment.<br />I was also a little puzzled by this installment's title, &quot;The Prodigal Sun&quot;.  It's apparently supposed to be a play on words for &quot;The Prodigal SON&quot;.  This phrase is mentioned in the book (with the spelling SON), as it relates to one of the characters, but there is nothing in the book to indicate what is meant by the spelling of SUN in the title.  Perhaps this will be revealed in later books; so far I have only read the first one.	2004-01-14

I won't include anything about the plot because you can read that in other reviews.  My problems with the book are that too many things that are central to the story are only hinted at.  The creatures used for the fine hunt, for example, are never described - you only get a vague sense of what they look like.  The same goes for the Aya themselves - there's never a complete physical description of them.  Maybe it's just that I like a little more directness in a book, but I found that there was a lot lacking in this story related to these shortcomings.	2003-11-10

A human and his robot are marooned on a planet with an alien called Carnivore.  There's a kind of tunnel that allows people to be transported from planet to planet, and Carnivore has arrived on this planet by way of that tunnel.  Unfortunately, this particular stop of the tunnel is only one way - the way off the planet is closed because the tunnel seems to be broken on this end.  <br />Nothing much happens in this book besides the characters doing a little exploring, and trying to figure out how to get the tunnel working again.  They also try to figure out the mystery of a pond that's not quite a pond, a creature frozen in time, a mysterious hill near the pond, and the reason why some sort of intelligence is 'freezing' all of their minds once a day in something they call the 'God-hour'.  All of this becomes sort of a mish-mash of concepts that hints at coming together at the end of the book, to explain what's going on with this planet.  However, the ending is wrapped up very quickly, and isn't that satisfying.<br />This book is probably worth the read if you're a die-hard Simak fan like me, but for anyone else, it's not all that interesting.	2002-07-25

Lots of action, some parts dragged a little bit, but overall it's an enjoyable read.  The ending is a little weak and inconclusive.  The author seems to be saying that even after all that Maia, the main character, went through, it wasn't going to change the world of Stratos much in the short term.  That's fine, but I still would have liked to read a little more about what happened to Maia herself.  Three pages before the end of the book, she is in mortal danger, then at the end she is ok...sort of...but it left me feeling kind of empty.  A good book if you can deal with the somewhat vague ending.	2002-03-06

Some may say it's unfair to review it if you didn't read the whole thing, but here I am writing a review anyway. The truth is, I could not make it past the first two chapters of this book.  The writing was so poor, and the mess of characters introduced at such a rapid pace, that I was literally writing down all the relationships between the characters on a white-board, just to get it all straight.  When I say poor, I mean extremely, completely bad writing; poor grammar, sentences that didn't make sense, and a very confusing way of telling a story.  A textbook case of bad writing, if I can be allowed to make such a pun.  I think that the only reason Ms. Asimov got this book published was because of her famous husband.  I was actually embarassed for the Asimovs after trying to get through this book...	2002-03-05

I am really rating the series as a whole, up to book four.  I loved the first one....but then it went downhill from there.  The actual plot of the story - the alien invasion - advances very slowly, and more slowly as each book in the series is introduced.  In book four there are entire chapters where the main character and his love interest just banter and chatter aimlessly - doing nothing to advance the story, and much to irritate the reader.  Add all these problems to the fact that Mr. Gerrold hasn't written the fifth book in the series yet after several years - it may never be written at this point - and I would strongly recommend that you don't even start reading this series.  The only thing worse than a series that begins terribly is one that starts out good, but then gets terrible as it goes along.  At least in the first case, you can abandon it before you've wasted too much time.	2001-04-17

As usual, the detail of the characters themselves is somewhat sparse.  Simak wastes no time in getting right to the plot, and that is what I like about his books.  He can pack more story into a 200-page book than some authors do in several 500-page books. This book is a story of Earth in the future, when most of humanity has been mysteriously taken from Earth, but a few people are still left on Earth.  The people that are left barely age, living thousands of years, and are able to teleport themselves to other planets (a concept also visited in Simak's &quot;Time is the Simplest Thing&quot;).  After 3,000 years, Earth is rediscovered by the people that were taken away from it.	2001-02-26

In that series, the writing is complex, but a lot of surprises are in store by the end of the series.  Unfortunately, in this series, there are not many surprises.  The major problem with the first story is that it plods along rather slowly.  Events that are seemingly trivial to the reader are covered in agonizing detail.  The second story (&quot;Lake of the Long Sun&quot;) is a bit better, as things start to pick up a bit.

If this is your first Gene Wolfe series, you may never read his work again after this series.  I've read his &quot;New Sun&quot; books and enjoyed them very much because, while it's heavy reading - you really have to pay attention - there are some stunning surprises.  Unfortunately, in the Book of the Long Sun, there are no surprises.  You already know when you read the back cover of the books that the people are on a &quot;generation starship&quot;.  Figuring out who the &quot;gods&quot; are and the meaning of &quot;Mainframe&quot; isn't too difficult either.  By the end of the fourth book, there really isn't anything special that is revealed that you couldn't figure out long before.  Another major problem with this whole series is that seemingly trivial events are often covered in pain-staking detail, while more important things are glossed over entirely.  At the end of this volume, the long-awaited visit to Mainframe is dealt with in less than a chapter.  All in all, quite a disappointment.	2001-01-04

As usual, Cherryh paints a very  believable future society.  <br />One point should be made about this book  being stand-alone.  If you read Cherryh's web site, she lists this book as  part of the Alliance/Union universe, but the timeline given in the book  contradicts this.  There ARE some elements in this book that are in the  Alliance/Union series (such as the cloned humans called &quot;azi&quot;).   However, the colonization of the first planet in this book happens at  approximately the same time as most of the events in the &quot;Company  Wars&quot; of the Alliance/Union series, which makes it hard to believe  that these books are really in the same &quot;universe&quot;.  I believe  the author attempted to fit some of her books written before  &quot;Downbelow Station&quot; into the Alliance/Union chronology, but with  this one especially, it's something of a stretch.  However, it doesn't hurt  the book.  You will enjoy it just as much, but consider it a stand-alone  book.	2000-02-18
