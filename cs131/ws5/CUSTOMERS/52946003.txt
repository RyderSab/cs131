His first novel, The Sea of Grass (1937) was made into a not-very-good studio-shot movie by Elia Kazan in 1947, starring Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, and Robert Walker. His 1953 book The Light in the Forest was popular with juvenile male readers during the 1950s and early 1960s (and was a popular Disney movie starring James MacArthur and Jessica Tandy in 1958), but Richter seems a largely forgotten writer, more so that Wright Morris (an award-winning writer about the Great Plains who never produced a best-seller), and much so that Willa Cather (regarded as the great Great Plains novelist)<br /><br />His 1942 novel (Richter's second) Tacey Cromwell begins with an orphaned boy running away from a very harsh eastern Kansas home of one uncle with a dog from another uncle, some time in the 1890s or 1900s. The dog does not make it out of Kansas, but the boy (\\"Nugget\\") finds the half-brother (Gaye Oldaker) whom he has never seen in Socorro, a New Mexico silver-mining boom town, where he is a dealer in the casino part of the town's best bordello, the White Palace,  and living with the title character, the bordello's proprietor. Together they move to Brewery Gulch in the copper-mining town of Bisbee, Arizona. The narrator recalls with anguish the \\"respectable\\" townswomen getting the two children Tacey was raising taken away and her difficult life as his own was eased by his brother marrying into the local elite (following Tacey's directions even about whom to marry).<br /><br />I think his de facto \\"sister,\\" Seely, is rather stereotyped (a tomboy with bad genes), but Tacey is a very interesting character and the  caste-like line between the \\"quality\\" folk and the irredeemably outcast that men might cross but women could not was skillfully dramatized by Richter.<br /><br />The novel was filmed in 1955 as \\"One Desire\\" starring Anne Baxter, Rock Hudson, and Natalie Wood.

Two years earlier, on the cusp between DADAism and surrealism he had inverted (and perverted) the 17th-century didactic book of the same title by Fenelon. Both authors imagined Telemachus, son of crafty Ulysses and patient (and far-from-guileless) Penelope, setting out to find out why his father has not returned to Greece with the other victors of the Trojan War.<br /><br />Telemachus and his ancient Mentor (the goddess of wisdom, Minerva in gender-crossing disguise) wash up on the shores of Ogygia, where his father had earlier dallied with Calypso and her nymphs. The family resemblance is instantly noticed, and Calypso wants to take up with the younger image of the lover who abandoned her. He is also lusted after by the nymph Eucharis.<br /><br />I am making it sound as if there was a plot, but the book is almost entirely digressions that are not senseless, but are mostly pointless, as Aragon played with words and the strange juxtapositions DADAists conjured and adored.  I would estimate that the text is less than 20,000 words. Perhaps it is delightful in French, though I doubt it. It was certainly a provocation, including a lesbian tryst and the debauching a virtuous youth (the inversion of Fenelon). In the formulation of the helpful (tr&eacute;s academic) introduction by the brave translators), Aragon (et al.) \\"freed himself from the constraints of mimeticism in regard to fable, meaning, and language, ... dissociated language from significance... [and] generated a verbal overflow or overkill, kindling the desire for and the voluptuousness of verbal indulgence\\"... which is not everyone's glass of absinthe.	2005-08-10

Her 1980 play draws heavily on the writings of Virginia and Leonard Wolf and Vita Sackville-West. (It is dedicated to the son of the latter, who chronicled his mother's affair with Virginia Wolf.)<br /><br />There is little drama, no action, and far more monologue than dialogue. The title role has torrents of lines. Except in the middle, it is a one-woman play. It would take some one with the presence and stamina of Maggie Smith (who played the role in London in 1981) to be bearable.<br /><br />Such major shaping events as there were in Wolf's life are recalled by her (rather than dramatized), though I wonder how much sense they could make to someone lacking familiarity with the Bloomsbury set of her day. Those who are familiar with it will find no new perspective on Wolf and her playmates.<br /><br />Reading the play increases my admiration for the renderings of the troubled writer in Michael Cunningham's _The Hours_.	2005-07-26

The final one, no less prosaic than the other multi-part riffs, \\"Yellow Kitchen Gloves,\\" jottings on a demonstration in Washington, D.

The body of fastidiously coiffured man who has been shot is found amidst a vast accumulation of junk in a house slated for demolition one muggy Paris summer day. There are no clues about who the dead man is, so before trying to find out who killed him and why, Maigret must first figure out who he was and how he came to be where he was shot.<br /><br />There is a very bitter wife (a recurrent figure in Simenon fiction, especially \\"The Cat\\") and some long-ago passions, and a long-ago (just after WWII) unsolved murder case that Maigret reopens in his quest to understand why (as much or more than who) killed the derelict. The investigation involves Maigret going to the Mediterranean coast in a quite humorous sortie. As usual, he eats well, though he was curbing his intake of beer on his physician's orders in this top-notch police procedural novel.	2005-07-06

It is not that they had been living together for decades. Both had outlived earlier spouses and wed eight years before. Marguerite fancies herself a fine lady. She still owns some buildings, though her father once owned the whole street, which is named for him. Emile was a working man who helped her with a burst pipe and stayed around. He dotes on a cat that Emile cannot stand for a number of reasons, including concern about her own pet, a parrot.<br /><br />While he is sick, she poisons the cat. He takes vengeance on the tail feathers of the parrot, worries about being poisoned himself, runs away (not very far to a room above the bar his sometimes sexual partner runs) for a while. Marguerite is humiliated by his departure and silently implores him to return, where they continue to prepare food separately and communicate only by notes. As the houses across the street (which her father once owned) are being loudly demolished, several time, \\"he almost spoke to her; he wanted to say something, anything, appeasing words. He realized that it was too late now and that neither of them could turn back.\\" They are together until death doth them part.<br /><br />The novel is a portrait of savage marital disgust for each other, strongly ( but not entirely) slanted to the grievances of the man. Simenon seems to share Emil's view that \\"she needed to be unhappy, a victim of men's wickedness,\\" forgetting no outrage to her refined sensibility and not recognizing any faults of her own. Husbands getting fed up and leaving was a recurrent theme for Simenon (M. Monde Vanishes). \\"The Cat\\"  was filmed with Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret as a couple who had once loved each other, a past unlike the one Simenon supplied the characters.	2005-07-06

That the chapters are comprised of entries in diaries/journals about sex and that the entries vary considerably in length, graphic detail, era, and geography increases the difficulty of making generalizations.<br /><br />The book is definitely not for anyone (straight or gay) who is squeamish about graphic details of male-male sex or of erotic desperation. Not that all the selections include either of these. The lengthiest chapter involves S&M (mostly dominance/submission, but with some infliction of pain) and others describe bodies and pleasures in detail. Some other writers were desperately seeking a spouse. Perhaps that is the major divide, not just among the authors but among gay men more generally: those who want to marry, settle down, and raise kids and those (some of them in open relationships) who enjoy meeting through meating and are fascinated by novelty rather than the comforts of familiarity. Some of the authors deplore anonymous sex, some revel in it.<br /><br />There is poignancy. There is wit. And even some wisdom (after David Leddick described disappointment in his natal family, a man told him: \\"They are not your family, they are only your relatives\\"). There are reports of encounters that make me embarrassed for the author and/or his sexual partner. Most of the entries/selections do not seem meant to arouse. The exception (the longest chapter in the book) is titled \\"Something Sensational to Read on the Train\\" but is more analytic than incantory about what excited David May between 1978 and 1984.<br /><br />The choice of lines from within the chapters as titles deserve special praise, and the author bios are unusually entertaining. I skipped around and find it hard to imagine reading straight through (I eventually read all of the chapters, but over the course of more than a year.)<br /><br />The chapters that I thought were a waste of the time I spent reading them were those by Jack Bissell, Joseph Manera, Felice Picano (an essay that doesn't even fit the parameters of being a diary entry about personal sexual experience), and Dan Perdios. Not all the other were great, but had somethings of interest and/or were entertaining.<br /><br />In sex ad acronyms (another of the sources for my stalled book on desire) the authors are mostly GWM with a few GBM; no GLM or GAM. Baby-boomers and generation X. A few entries are by Americans in Europe, most are set in the USA. To take three themes from the title of a South Asian memoir, I'd say that despite the subtitle's emphasis on sex, AFTERWORDS is more about longings and not (feeling one) belongs than about sex.ere a waste of the time I spent reading them were those by Jack Bissell, Joseph Manera, Felice Picano (an essay that doesn't even fit the parameters of being a diary entry about personal sexual experience), and Dan Perdios.

Repetitions of basic information about the characters is rarer. If the stories were published separately, there is no indication of credits.<br /><br />Socrates remains a compelling figure. He continues to develop, as he manages rage that is often provoked. Unfortunately, his quasi-son Daryl doesn't grow (as a character).<br /><br />The final chapter/story in the book is particularly gripping, though I remain uncertain that someone conditioned to self-preservation in a long prison sentence would undertake such dangerous public protest. Several non-black, mostly Latino people champion him in his confrontations with police, developers, and coworkers. Mosley's prose is always compelling and any sentimentality rubs against a world of Brechtian pressures and troubles.	2004-12-04

Honored and esteemed by other writers for a large and diverse body of work, none of his writing ever caught on with many general readers. The 1977 FORK RIVER SPACE PROJECT was the 19th of his 20 published novels. It gets off to a promising start as a May-September couple on the Nebraska/Kansas border seek a handyman to deal with a clogged sink.<br /><br />\\"Plumbers do not come cheap,\\" but the plumber lives (in what turns out to be nearly a ghost town) with a house-painter (who used to write) who works for three dollars an hour. Dahlberg, the painter, establishes himself with the young(er) wife, as the husband bemusedly watches their relationship develop and investigates the strange depopulation of Fork River (the not-quite abandoned town in which 700 people formerly lived, until a tornado or something swept a dozen and a large amount of dirt away, leaving a crater that is guarded by the plumber, the painter, and one other resident).<br /><br />The middle of the not-very-long novel drags, and the ending is disappointingly inconclusive. The wry, tolerant voice of the narrator glides through being usurped and the oddities of the isolated, haunted not-quite ghost town, making  readers smile, but leaving them ultimately high and dry and, perhaps, wistful.<br /><br />(The previous posted review is clearly not about this book.)	2004-11-22

Surprisingly, only one of the stories (the last one in the volume, \\"Dead Woman's Grove\\") is set in Portugal. It and the first and longest story (\\"Deus ex Machina,\\" set in the Netherlands) involve consummated romances (fornication in the first, adultery in the last). The relationships in all six of the stories are cut off before the rake narrator tired of his conquests and was ready to move on, with several involving the tragic demise or removal of the woman before an agreed-upon rendez-vous in Spain or Italy or Turkey, and another with the quarry slipping away before agreeing to a rendez-vous.<br />None of the stories is at all sexually graphic. The shorter stories (the middle four) are slight. \\"Deux ex Machina\\" and \\"Question Mark\\" are the most entertaining (with considerable irony turned on the narrator's youthful self),  \\"Dead Woman's Grove\\" the most melodramatic. (I'm surprised it hasn't been turned into an opera.).<br />The collected writings of Manuel Teixeira-Gomes's stories invoke the pre-World War I era of cosmopolitan European seduction games. With storm clouds of another war massing over Europe in 1934, when the stories were written, the balance between nostalgia and laughing at the youthful seducer's self-infatuation is tipped more to the former.	2004-04-25

They are, instead, long on character development, with lives of quiet and not-so-quiet desperation. Although the denouement is very sudden in \\"Michel,\\" I most like it and \\"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.\\" I find \\"Letter to Gianfranco\\" and \\"The Redemption of the Cannibal Woman\\" overwrought-both in literary style and in their protagonists' wild fantasizing about recognition and redemption (and love).

The first set is a mix of relationships of some duration and \\"tricks;\\" the second set mostly portrays single encounters. The stories are sexually graphic. I would say that there are not \\"about sex,\\" but about trying to understand some men, including the author, through sexual encounters (how they connected and disconnected in a more general sense than that of organs and orifices). The pleasures are most definitely \\"embodied,\\" the regrets are mostly not about what the bodies did or did not do.<br />Adams celebrates the sexual connections across the American great divide of race that he made, varying in duration though the relationships were, during two particularly interesting epochs of modern American gay history, the pre-AIDS late-1970s and the post-everything years of the start of the third millennium.	2004-03-24

Although insightful, her chapter is unhistorical in being unmoored from dates of composition or publication.<br />The chapters by Robert Buffington on the denigration of the elite's masculinity in newspapers aimed at the Mexican working class and by Victor Macias-Gonzales on the quest of the would-be fashionable to look whiter (i.e., less Indian, more Parisian) are focused on general cultural conceptions rather than on chronological developments, but provide dates for the reader (Buffington being more compunctious about this). Both chapters include reproductions of cartoons and advertisements from Mexican publications of the era. Their authors and the authors of the two chapters discussing the scandal and its published representations (Carlos Monsivais and Robert Irwin) are also sensitive to and insightful about the class and racial/ethnic dynamics, placing the bust of the 41 in the context of undercutting the legitimacy of the unmanly, Francophilic,_refinadito_ (hyper-refined)  elite.<br />Although I'd have wished for systematic comparison to other homosexual \\"scandals\\" of the late-19th and early-20th centuries (and, like the authors, to know what those swept up for breaking no laws thought of their treatment and press coverage of the ball and raid), there is a great deal of fascinating early-20th-century material and of stimulating early-21st-century analysis in this volume.  elite. <br />Although I'd have wished for systematic comparison to other homosexual \\"scandals\\" of the late-19th and early-20th centuries (and, like the authors, to know what those swept up for breaking no laws thought of their treatment and press coverage of the ball and raid), there is a great deal of fascinating early-20th-century material and of stimulating early-21st-century analysis in this volume.	2003-12-27

L. Doctorow, Stephen King, and Charles Bukowski-with a bit too much King and not enough Doctorow for my own tastes.<br />The book is easier to surrender to if one believes some psychics are legitimate and in ghostly possession, but I was able to enjoy it as a story about someone who works with psychics he believes provide him at least clues (and who doesn't believe in ghosts). Carlos, the &quot;psychic detective&quot; narrating his investigation into a long-ago disappearance does not claim to have psychic powers and acknowledges that most psychics are fakes, but has consistently gained insights from a few. The three he involves in his quest for New York Supreme Court Justice Joseph Force Crater, who disappeared during the 1930s,  are the novel's most interesting characters.<br />The novel is a page-turner and fits into the detective genre in having a knight-errant drop-out from the conventional world glimpsing a lot of official corruption. The voice of the 1930s judge does not ring quite true to me, but my primary frustration is with Carlos's motivation to stir this particular congealed murk and the puzzling lack of following through to the fruits of his search.	2003-12-17

Her book provides a good introduction to Sicily, and also provides many interesting reflections for those who have visited the island and are familiar with the literature about it.<br /><br />_Sicilian Odyssey_ lacks the familiarity based on long-time residence underlying Peter Robb's involuted and near-desparing _Midnight in Sicily_ , Daphne Phelps's The Most Beautiful House in Sicily, or Mary Taylor Simeti's _On Persephone's Island_. Prose's travel book is, however, much better informed than Lawrence Durrell's entertaining _Sicilian Carousel_, but there are not any characters as vivid in Prose's book as some of those in the other books I've mentioned.<br /><br />I think that Prose's book is a useful introduction to Sicily that also contains much of interest to those with previous experience of Sicily and the writings about it in English.<br /><br />She writes acutely about food (rightly summing up that \\"if freshness [of ingredients] is the hallmark of Sicilian cuisine, subtlety is not\\").and art and architecture, with insightful bits of appreciation of Sicilian writers and photographers and of what Caravaggio did while on Sicily.

Or, is it, perhaps, painfully American to focus on minorities?<br />White accedes that the Left Bank avant-garde is a fading memory.<br />What is vibrant is the Arab (North African) and West African slums, away from the historic center. White asserts that \\"the only way France can continue to function as a beacon of civilization, as anything more than a custodian of its great heritage, is by embracing the international, hybridized culture that is already thriving within the city limits\\" (albeit at the far reaches of those limits). White says this, but he appears to know very little about the Arabo-French or Afro-French hybrids.<br />Similarly, the chapter on Jews in Paris has a lengthy exposition of the Dreyfus Affair, but nothing about contemporary Parisian Jewish culture.<br />Insofar as there is a primary thesis in the book, it is that French universalism accepts individuals but not groups. Both Jews and African Americans overestimated their assimilation, and generations of smug French people have congratulated themselves on an illusory--or at least misleading--absence of prejudice in particularly invidious contrast to American racism. White  does not note the extent to which modern nationalism arose in places overrun by Napoleon's armies (and later colonial conquests) protesting French claims to be dispensing freedom by abrogating local customs and forcing Enlightenment teachings on priest (etc.)-ridden, backward inferiors.<br />\\"The paradox of the French spirit, which is boldly outspoken about individual experience but against all comunitarianism based on that experience,  is best reflected in its literature,\\" White writes. And his book is primarily about writers. In addition to Parisian Jews and African Americans White discourses at some length about Baudelaire and Colette, documentary photographer Eugene Atget and about (or, rather, against) the painter Gustave Moreau, about the two main brands of royalists,  and more briefly about Oscar Wilde after his release from English prison. The book concludes with a sixteen page tour of literature about Paris that is useful, but less personal than the similar romp through the Proust literature at the end of White's tighter and more illuminating  short biography of Marcel Proust.<br />Although I am manifestly less than enthralled with  the book I want to reiterate that there is a lot of interesting information and discerning interpretation in it. It strikes me as rather soul-less, but still a text that is not without its pleasures.flected in its literature,\\" White writes. And his book is primarily about writers.

Verghese, who grew up in Ethiopia and who finished medical school in his (Christian) parents homeland of India, clearly describes the allocation of medical personnel in the US. He also understands the  resentments  by those of old stock, poor white patient of affluent foreign-born doctors. As the title indicates, Verghese  wanted to feel at home where he chose to settle, to provide his sons a sense of belonging in one place, a sense that he had not had in his own peripatetic life. Like his patients, however, he was never certain that seeming acceptance was was more than provisional.<br />This insightful, lyrical, and moving book provides  a vivid account of being an alien doctor in rural America dealing with a terrifying disease that was (and is) also perceived as alien, as something that, in the view of many, other kinds of people contract and probably deserve. Acute analyses of  American (including Asian-American) arrangements and assumptions underlie a poignant narrative of AIDS coming  to the northeastern Tennessee hills. Verghese shares Oliver Sackss ability to engage readers in the horror and the mystery of sufferings for which physicians have no magic bullets.  As Paul Farmer, another physician who made a difference,  showed in _AIDS and Accusation_, how a society responds to AIDS  illuminates much about the society, not only how medical services are organized and financed in it. Verghese shows strengths as well as weaknesses in rural Southeastern American  backwaters. He also illuminates connections from such seemingly isolated  places to the larger society and ties of blood to distant urban centers where gay men sought refuge.	2003-03-12

For the first hundred-plus pages it provides an account of a not-very-bright, twelve-year-old Chad Coultas, growing up in a small Midwestern town at an unspecified date between the end of World War I and the start of the Great Depression. (Purdy was born in 1927 and grew up in rural Ohio. . . but I doubt was as poor a student as Chad.) His usually absent father, Lewis, has squandered his mother-in-law's fortune in bad investments. His mother stays in the mansion-sized house, trying to ignore realities of any sort, preferring to work on delicate embroidery. His sister spends most of her time in front of a mirror practicing to become an actress.<br />And then Decatur, a decorated Menominee Indian hero of the First World War, whose fortune has been waxing as the Coultas one has waned, starts stalking Chad. picking him up after school each day in a different car. This alarms his spinster teacher, Miss Lytle, who had been Decatur's teacher earlier. Miss Lytle visits Mrs. Coultas, but the latter is even more reluctant to acknowledge this disconcerting pattern than she is to face the realities of her husband's infidelities and malfeasances. . . or that her son looks remarkably like Decatur did when he was on the cusp of adolescence. Soon they are off on a rollicking road trips with both biological and legal fathers.<br />The second half of the novel is picaresque, but Chad is no picar&oacute;. He is too oblivious even to be an unreliable narrator, so it is good that Purdy did not make him the narrator.<br />There is some blood (and tar and feathers...), but the novel is not depressing, as some of Purdy's other fiction definitely is. Much of it is uproariously funny, though deadly serious issues of racism are central to the plot. Although the book veers away from lyrical realism into dreamily gothic surrealism half-way through, I found the second half very entertaining. Some suspending of disbelief is necessary, but not as much as in David Lynch works, and the book has a satisfying denouement (unlike not only much of David Lynch's work, but some of Purdy's other work, too).<br />Recognizing that I am in a minority, I highly recommend this novel as more than a worthy successor to such earlier masterpieces as  MALCOM and IAM ELIJAH THRUSH.ay from lyrical realism into dreamily gothic surrealism half-way through, I found the second half very entertaining.

Although I first read this novel, which was instantly recognized on its publication as a great book, as a teenager, I can't imagine that I understood the politics of the novel's second half, and wonder about assigning this book to high school students. There is no graphic sex or violence, but to understand cumulative disillusionments and disappointments seems to me to require experience few teenagers in America have.<br />Be that as it may, this is at once a wise and a funny (mostly satiric, though two fight scenes approach slapstick) book. I enjoy as well as respect it.<br />There is a lot to admire in Ellison's creation of characters and milieux and in his often exhilarating language and shifting style. (Ellison himself characterized it as moving from  naturalism (&agrave; la Richard Wright) to expressionism to surrealism - though the Battle Royale seems already quite surrealist/absurdist to me.) I don't question that it is a great book, but great books (e.g., Moby Dick, The Charterhouse of Parma) are often not perfectly crafted books. The narrator strikes me as being  a little too naive to have survived to junior year in college, so that there is some sense in Dr. Bledsoe's shock and irritation at having to give him Negro in the South 101 instruction.<br />There are too many long speeches (in particular, I'd cut the blind speaker at a Founder's Day assembly) and the narrator seems oddly lacking in sexual desire of any sort -- though he experiences some of what Chester Himes referred to as the absurdities of being a black male with all the fantasies about black virility.  The never-named narrator seems too numb too soon, and there is nowhere to go with the notion of invisibility once he falls down a rabbit hole (coal shoot) into his own private, brightly-lit wonderland.	2003-02-20

It draws heavily on the same materials and examples as Lewis's book _The Muslim Discovery of Europe_. The first three chapters are revisions of 1999 lectures in Vienna, the rest from earlier; none was written or revised post-9/11. In that the focus is on Ottoman discourse about the west and/or \\"modernity,\\" this does not much matter, but it does bear stressing that the book deals with earlier attempts to learn not recent violent attacks in/of the west or the reactionary regimes or movements within Islamdom engaged in \\"a downward spiral of hate and spite, rage and self-pity, poverty and oppression.\\"<br />Lewis does not present convincing evidence that the problem as he has specified it (\\"What went wrong with our culture?\\") has or has had much currency even within what was the Ottoman Empire. Insofar as he provides an answer to it, it is an answer that reinforces the widespread view in America of fundamental and total cultural inferiority of The Other and is exceedingly unlikely to be accepted by those presented as inferior and inspire the razing from within of their cultures (the plural is mine, not Lewis's) or aspirations (however unrealized) to justice and equality from the Qur'an. A reader will get no idea of these aspirations from Lewis; a far better introduction is provided in Karen Armstrong's _Islam_.<br />There is certainly much interesting information, particularly on Ottoman observers of European phenomena, and some sound ideas (e.g., what Lewis calls the ecclesiastization of Islam and borrowing the demonization of Jews from Christian traditions) but many questions are begged, especially Lewis's metaphor of polyphony from music to complex society, especially in that the Ottoman Empire was an ethnically diverse society that some Muslims somehow managed to govern for centuries even without appreciating European art and art music.	2003-01-14

(This book preceded Chester Himes's Coffin Ed and Grave Digger novels by more than a third of a century.)<br />W. E. B. DuBois castigated the group of younger writers of which Fisher was a part for sensationalizing low life rather than celebrating the &quot;talented tenth&quot; of which they were presumably a part.  I don't know if Fisher was stung by this, but the protagonists  include a physician (like Fisher himself), a policeman who is the only black who has risen to the rank of detective, and an African prince with a princely sense of noblesse oblige. Also an critically important part is played by a mortician, a kind of professional.<br />The main lower-status participants, who liven things up with a running game of the dozens, are not debauched, and the \\"conjure man\\" turns out not to be the wacko many thought him to be.<br />The middle of the novel sags.

Sallis's biography weighs in at 368 pages. It is readable despite numerous repetitions and some awkwardness about introducing other figures in Himes's life, but Sallis's book does not seem to be based on any new research and relies almost entirely on reviews contemporary to the original publications of Himes's book augmented by what academic critics have written. It is very odd that Sallis provides so little of his own reading of Himes's writing.<br />The biographical research on which Sallis draws very, very heavily and without citation is the discerning and more succinct (209-page) 1997 biography by Edward Margolies and Michel Fabre, _The Several Lives of Chester Himes_. Margolies and Fabre knew Himes in his later years and did serious biographical research on Himes (and other black American expatriates to France, especially Richard Wright, who helped Himes in many ways when he moved to Paris). Sallis adds no discernible research and does not make more sense of Himes than they did, so I would recommend the Margolies and Fabre biography in preference to the Sallis one (and on Himes's writing, Stephen Milliken's 1976 book _Chester Himes_). One may read both biographies and both volumes of  Himes' &quot;memoirs&quot; and still wonder &quot;Who was this guy?&quot; and &quot;What made him tick?&quot; (Himes's own answer was &quot;hurt,&quot; but the way he deployed the category made it all but meaningless.)	2002-11-10

In 1978 he published _Children are the Revolution_, a book on Cuban daycare programs. A democratic socialist in the I.F. Stone and Michael Harrington tradition, Leiner admires the dramatic and effective extensions of literacy and healthcare to the masses, while believing that \\"socialism without democracy is a contradiction...lead[ing] to horrendous abuse of power.\\" It is as a \\"friend of the social revolution\\" that Leiner criticizes repression of dissent and the ongoing history of persecution of males judged insufficiently masculine (this is the official and folk Cuban construction of male homosexuality).<br />Women-women relations have never been an official or social concern. Extirpating male homosexuality, on the other hand, has been an enduring preoccupation of the regime. Toughening effeminate boys) through a variant of aversion therapy began early. \\"At no time did social scientists or educators consider homosexuality as anything other than `feminine' behavior by males, in accordance with common cultural stereotypes\\",  This model was accompanied by a belief that effeminacy/homosexuality is infectious, which justified removing effeminate boys from regular schools and barring \\"homosexuals\\" from jobs in education, medicine, and the mass media, where they might \\"infect\\" youth with their \\"incurable disease.\\" With the help of the block-level Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, those regarded as deviant by their neighbors were forced into \\"rehabilitation\\" work camps from 1963 until 1967, when these military-run concentration camps were closed in response to international pressure.<br />The view of male homosexuality as an \\"incurable disease\\"- and the eagerness to isolate its carriers where they could not infect others-were recapitulated when HIV was recognized in Cuba: another incurable disease reactivated the response of massive surveillance and quarantine of those identified as \\"diseased.\\" In addition to the equation of gender variance and homosexuality, another tenet of machismo is relevant to the strategy for dealing with AIDS that Cuba developed. ... In this widespread view, male sexual compulsivity is part of nature, not amenable to education, so stopping sexual transmissionof HIV required quarantine of those afflicted with incurable diseases, even of those macho \\"good revolutionaries\\" who volunteered for Cuba's African military adventures and contracted HIV there.<br />Rather than use the highly-developed educational system and the CDR structure to ensure that HIV+ people knew about and practiced safe sex, Cuban public health officials mandated life sentences in concentration camps (\\"sanatoria\\") for healthy HIV+ people (three-quarters of them men, one third of whom are estimated to be \\"homosexuals\\").  Leiner is well aware that married heterosexuals receive the best treatment in the camps (that since the writing of his book have been too expensive to maintain) and are much more likely than homosexual \\"degenerates\\" to be considered \\"responsible\\" enough to be furloughed out).<br />Leiner is critical of the Cuban government's enduring authoritarianism, machismo, heterosexism, and how the latter two blocked sex education and a more humane AIDS policy. Although there is less than one would expect from his own long-running observations and interviews, Leiner marshalls a range of data from published and unpublished sources about official policies. More in sorrow than in anger, he criticizes Cuban sex education, persecution of homosexuals (and of the effeminate boys regarded as proto-homosexuals), and the incarceration for their lifetime of HIV+ persons (now alledgedly relaxed). While ably analyzing cultural roots of sexual politics, Leiner's book gives practically no sense of what it is like for men or for women to live in Cuba, in or out of its concentration camps. (For what it was like during the 1970s, there is Reinaldo Arenas's chilling memoir _Before Night Falls_).chilling memoir _Before Night Falls_).	2002-11-10

The Truth--a quite complicated truth--seems to seek him out and press itself on him. The non-hero eventually learns not only \\"whodunit,\\" but why some puzzling events occurred.<br />The novel is absorbing (I had to stay up and finish reading it) and superbly crafted. . . and more heartbreaking even than the initial horror of the boy losing his home and whole family in one night. My only doubt is about sparing a twelve-year-old from reprisals. Although such reprisals were more common Nazi practice in Poland and Greece than among conquered fellow \\"Aryans,\\" I think that deciding to spare and help a nine- or ten-year-old would have been less open to question and that the perceptions of the 1945 night that are recorded could be those of a younger child.	2002-11-10

Its prime interest is in the sarcastic portraits Himes provided of fellow exiled African American writers Richard Wright and James Baldwin.<br />In addition to satirizing Wright, Baldwin (and less known African American exiles Ollie Harrington and William Gardner Smith), Himes was killing off a white woman Elizabeth Hancock, very like  Willa Trierweiler, a married/separated woman with whom Himes had a long and tormented relationship (she is also the basis for Kriss in _The End of the Primitive_). This is the woman for whose rape and murder four African Americans have been found guilty by a French court. There was neither a rape nor a murder, though \\"[wo]manslaughter\\" seems a verdict that could be justified.<br />Those convicted of the crimes have carried to Europe the American lesson that \\"it is always best for any Negro to deny any charge lodged against him, to deny it totally and continuously, rather than try to explain the degree of his guilt.\\" Himes indicts his own character for elf-defeating (hurt) pride, Wright for naivet&eacute; (and failure to appreciate the nobility of his relationship with Willa) and worldly success, and Baldwin for volunteering to be an \\"Uncle Tom.\\"<br />As a semi-fictionalized document on the attitudes of one major expatriate African American writer, the book has some value, but don't expect much in the way of plausibility or narrative development.	2002-11-07

However, as Salzman's engaging and insightful memoir shows beyond any doubt, there are interesting characters even in such prosaic locales as Ridgefield, Connecticut during the 1970s and Salzman's memoir of that time and place is filled with delights for readers. LOST IN PLACE deserves (and would reward) a larger audience than it seems to have had.<br />There is drama and tragedy and a lot of comedy in Salzman's memoir (and a deep compassion for human fraility, even his own here and in his other marvelous books. The young Salzman tried different things, including training to be an astronaut (by sitting for hours in a box), seeking enlightenment as a Zen monk, becoming a concert (classical music) cellist or playing electric cello in a jazz ensemble, becoming a kung fu master, learning to speak and read Chinese, and getting out of high school early (into Yale). Each of these excessive (obsessive) endeavors had the full support of his go-getter mother and was the object of deflating irony from his weary social worker father, and most were eventually integrated into the life of the young man who went off to China for experiences engagingly told in IRON AND SILK.	2002-10-01

Among other things, it shows that the elite (creationist) discourse about social construction remains very far from the lived experience of even articulate and reflective natives.  Michael Nava's memoir of Sacramento and Jesse Monteagudo's of Miami struck me tas the most poignant and insightful. The absence of any Asian-Americans was noticeable. It would be interesting to know if American lesbian writers have similar senses of place and to link these splendid accounts to theories of cognition of place, but these are both other projects.	2002-09-19

The responses of the subjects to the drawings are usually very interesting, with greater paranoia on the part of other visual artists than of the aging movie stars.<br />The best stories are in the sittings with Ginger Rogers, Bette Davis, Jack Nicholson, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Louise Brooks. The accounts of those \\"stars\\"  in whom I have no particular interest (Alice Faye, Ruby Keeler, Helmut Newton) contained insights (both from sitter and portraitist) and Bachardy's prose shows the admirable qualities of those whom I hoped would display them (Ingrid Bergman, Myrna Loy, Maggie Smith, Iris Murdoch, Louise Brooks, Henry Fonda, James Merrill, Barbara Stanwyck, Olivia de Havilland, Alec Guiness, Laurence Olivier). The only one whom he comes to despise in the course of the interactions of drawing a portrait is Joan Fontaine. He remains a fan of most and gives even the devil (Miss Fontaine) her due.<br />The drawings are never flattering and the artist does not flatter himself either, but I find it interesting to read about a professional doing his or her job professionally. The reader gets a very good idea of what it is like to try to portray honestly movie stars and other cultural icons, as well as getting the portraits.

O'Brien venerates Joyce's writing, but recognizes the high cost to most  everyone who had any contact with Joyce.<br />Although she argues (without convincing me) that Joyce was not a misogynist, she does not attempt to defend him from being viewed as a monster; instead, she answers her question &quot;Do writers have to be such monsters in order to create? I believe that they do.&quot;<br />O'Brien provides interesting responses to Joyce's life and lifework. Hard-core Joyceans will already have processed Ellman's biography--regarded by some as the best biography of any writer ever written. The somewhat curious have a fine guide in O'Brien. Her book is generally readable, and I am inclined to trust her sense (as a novelist, as an Irish novelist) of what in Joyce's fiction is autobiographical.<br />The volume is an excellent match of biographer and subject, like Edmund White's biographical meditation on Marcel Proust  that began the series of Penguin Brief Lives, a welcome antidote to the mountains of details that make so many biographies daunting.	2002-08-25

I gulped it all down in two sittings. (It's not my fault: it's not only wise and funny but definitely a \\"page-turner.\\") Most of the characters ultimately prove to be better than they seemed. As in his later books, Cameron creates a range of interesting characters (female and male, gay and straight). That he can make New Yorkers sympathetic shows either great imagination or great skill! I even felt some sympathy for the unredeemed villainess and the two weak men she used in nefarious plots.<br />Like Armistead Maupin's tales of an interlinked but diverse cast of mostly young San Franciscans a decade earlier, Cameron's tales of New Yorkers in their early 30s are not sexually graphic. There are a few hints, but mostly it is relationships and love, not sex, that is his subject. Drugs are also invisible.<br />A lot happens to Cameron's characters and I was sorry to leave them behind when I reached the end.	2002-08-25

The story is told in alternating diaries of the two men. Originally from the Midwest and conventionally contemptuous of homosexuals, Tod is a database manager for a company somewhere on the San Francisco peninsula. Ikuko, his third-generation (Sansei) Japanese-American wife works with a Filipino-American (also third-generation, I think) gay man named Ramon. She accepts a dinner invitation from him. Bored by the shop talk and uneasy with a gay host, Tod has too much to drink. . .<br />The next morning Tod wakes up  - alone and nude - in Ramon's bed. He wonders why Ikukuo left him there, for how long, and (most of all) what happened after he passed out. Both Ramon and Tod wonder if Ikuko is throwing her husband at Ramon. And if she is, why? To make him more adventurous for her own pleasures? Because she wants to discard him and arrange a successor her herself? Because she suspects he is really gay? Etc.<br />Their diaries sort through evidence for various interpretations of Ikukuo's motivation and document the florescence of a relationship between Tod and Ramon. Ramon already knows, but is reminded by his sister: \\"Don't mess with married men. They are certain to bring heartache.\\" And Tod is alarmed to find that he enjoys sex with an \\"obvious homosexual\\" when not under the influence (/excuse) of alcohol.<br />Like Ramos's first novel, _Flipping_, _Searching for the Key_  explores the eroticized racial differences. Being a sociologist interested in the diversity of gay experiences, I am afraid that I have made this often very funny novel sound like a treatise on inter-racial sexual relationships. \\"Boys just want to have fun\\"-and they do. Ramon is more aware of the absurdities of love and desire than Tod, and his breezy comments are more often funny Tod is somewhat plodding, but he is in waters more alien to his background than is Ramon and has to \\"work through\\" some matters Ramon cannot remember caring about.

(The cultural logic of why it is better to write down prayers to the dead with whom one has a personal relationship than to a busy God who treats everyone even-handedly is spelled out early in the book). Each chapter begins with one of the letters, though most of the novel is recollections of the times at which the letters were written, and, therefore, not in the childish present tense voice of the letters to a dead movie star from Bong Bong, a boy whose parents were disappeared when he was eight.<br />Alumit creates a number of vivid characters, including Aunt Yuma, Dr. Chapman, Amanda and Bong/Bob's visions of J and of Montgomery Clift. Although there are a lot of issues (torture of political prisoners, complicity with dictators' money-laundering, exile, sexualities), the book does not seem didactic in the least. Bong Bong has or develops some of the compassion for others, including those responsible for his own sufferings, of \\"Miss Lonelyhearts.\\"<br />A Hollywood ending of sorts seems appropriate for someone who disappears so far into a Hollywood hallucination (and who grows up and lives in LA). This accomplised first novel is heartbreaking enough without destruction of all hope.	2002-07-25

Wharton is so linked with Henry James that no one seems to have noticed the extent to which she was a late naturalist, chronicled inexorable destruction. An argument could be made that Charity is rescued from her hereditary fate up in the mountains (the Berkshires) and that the prime upholder of convention takes pity on her plight, but _Summer_ is close to _Ethan Frome_ in more than a New England location. More pragmatic than some of those confronted with destruction in other Wharton works, Charity makes the best of her very limited options, but happiness is more fleeting than a New England summer is.<br />The lack of female solidarity in _Summer_  is especially striking. Lily Bart had one devoted female friend. Charity has none, and the professional woman she turns to is far and away the most vicious character in the book.<br />Most of the book is about the blooming of a love crossing social boundaries that I find tedious. Others, including, I think Wharton herself, enjoyed chronicling Charity's first experience of love with an out-of-towner whose life and commitments are elsewhere, but for me it is the portrait of small-town busybodies and the eventual narrow corner into which Charity paints herself (with the help of social hypocrisy and her  lack of education or any marketable skills ) that are interesting.<br />Susan Minot's introduction is helpful in placing the book within the course of Edith Wharton's life. A particularly important continuity across Wharton's work Minot observes  is that &quot;Wharton's heroines are not hapless victims; they understand their helplessness.&quot; I am not convinced that this enables them to keep their dignity, but the awareness of their plight and the unreasonability of social judgments heightens the tragedies (in contrast to Stephen Crane's _Maggie_ to take one example).	2002-07-05

Anyone who does not want to read about men having sexual encounters with men should steer away from this book. Like Renaud Camus's TRICKS from the same pre-AIDS era, or Ricardo Ramos's FLIPPING about that time in San Francisco, Bentley was finding out who the men he met were through sex: what they did, how they did it, and the places they lived. It was often the books (or the total lack of books), the recorded music (LPs then),,  and the artifacts in a trick's room or apartment that made incompatibility obvious.<br />\\"Getting laid\\" was a focus then and there for gay men (and for most young men most of the time in other eras and locales). However, it was necessary to make a living to have a place to live and to pay bar cover charges (and, perchance, to eat, bhough that was a low priority at the time). The gay novels of Manhattan/Provincetown/Fire Island  sex, drugs, and disco elide this, leaving readers to guess how the characters acquired money. Something I particularly appreciate in Bentley's book is his chronicling the difficulty of making a living. It also chronicles  what the Swedish investigator Benny Henriksson dubbed \\"the risk factor of love\\" (reducing \\"promiscuity\\" and having unprotected sex with an HIV-infected partner).<br />Like the fictional inhabitants of 28 Barbary Lane, Bentley paid no attention to politics (gay, HIV-prevention, or any other kind). Less sexually adventurous than Bentley, and writing in a \\"family newspaper,\\" Armistead Maupin in his well-known \\"tales\\" only hint at what life was like for gay men during \\"the golden age of promiscuity.\\" Written at the time (though culled recently), these diary entries  tells it like it was--without apologies, without shame, and without the chauvinism of \\"lgtb pride.\\"	2002-06-28

Weller shows that democracy can grow out of Chinese cultural roots and authoritarian institutions. Both the Chinese communist party leadership and the similarly geriatric authoritarianism of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew have justified their rule by some essential Chinese need for paternalist domination and claimed that human rights are a form of neocolonial and ethnocentric meddling from the West, and should not be allowed to disrupt the splendid Confucian subordination of individuals to collectivity. This view of necessary passivity -- an extreme version of cultural determinism --  is belied by the recent history of Taiwan. After half a century as a colony of Japan and half a century under brutally repressive Kuomintang martial law, democracy and civil society have blossomed in the last fifteen years. These days Taiwan is more democratic than its former tutor, the United States: there are election campaigns going on seemingly all the time in Taiwan, there is more real freedom of the press, and the candidate with the most votes in the 2000 election there became president.<br />Weller's comparison of civil society in Taiwan and in the PRC focused on  business organizations, religious groups, environmental movements, and women's networks, synthesizing a wealth of detail about \\"horizontal associations\\" (i.e., associations between equals in contrast to vertical relationships to the state apparatus or the deference to and domination by elders within families).<br />Weller justly claims that \\"by comparing China with the vibrant democracy that has developed over the last decade in Taiwan, I show how civil society can grow out of Chinese cultural roots and authoritarian institutions. \\"He is not so rash as to argue that a vibrant civil society and democracy will necessarily  blossom in China, only that the often invoked essential need for authoritarian rule has been disconfirmed.  It seems to me that, like most American social scientists who look through Taiwan to see China (whether a past or future one), Weller underestimates the extent of non-Chinese influences on Taiwan, including not only 20th-century Japanese and then American ones, but that Taiwan was incorporated into production for export in the early 17th century by European footholds (on an island never completed controlled by any imperial Chinese dynasty).<br /> South Korea provides another comparison of a society for which earlier authoritarian rulers claimed a Confucian duty to repress the \\"disorder\\" of public criticism. Like Taiwan, Korea was a Japanese colony (1910-45) and a flowering of civil society and democratization occurred during the 1990s.<br />Weller discusses material on voluntary associations from Taiwan and China interestingly, and his book is an important contribution to the comparative study of post-authoritarian sociopolitical transformation.that the often invoked essential need for authoritarian rule has been disconfirmed.

I would say too much, but despite the swirl of topics and some very strained transitions, I never found the book dull. (I should add that I may not be typical in this, because I am exactly the same age as Caton, so, like him, saw and was awed by the movie when I was 13, and am interested in the questions of cultural representations, hybridity, culture shock, and the enterprise of anthropology that are central to him.)<br /><br />The writing is sometimes clunky and often jargonistic. The chapter \\"Maskulinities\\" is startlingly ignorant (coming from a specialist on Yemen) about the importation and sexual connoisseurship of light-skinned males by  the elite of the Ottoman Empire (of which Yemen was a part from 1513 to 1916). Also I find many of Caton's statements about \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" very dubious, and the stills from the film in this book are atrociously reproduced.<br /><br />Despite my rejection of arguments in the \\"Maskulilnities\\" chapter and doubts about some others, there is much that is interesting about the history of colonialism, the Arab world, \\"Operation Desert Storm,\\" international film-making,  gendered film-viewing, and other topics  in this book.

It  surveys &quot;the growth and uses of Western learning: in late-18th and early 19th-century Japan. The primary figure Keene writes about is Honda Toshiaki (1744-1821). 74 of the books 246 pages are a translation of parts of Honda's &lt;i&gt;Secret Plan for Managing the Country&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tales of the West.&lt;/i&gt;<br />Keene provides a fascinating account of Japanese views of what Europe might be like based on emerging understanding of European knowledge and technology. Before American gunships forced Japan open and the Meiji &quot;restoration&quot; embarked on a program of rapid industrialization (and militarization), there was a base of thought on trying to adapt what seemed useful from the west in ways compatible with Japanese conceptions of the essence of Japaneseness. Keene's classic book provides valuable background to understanding the rapid &quot;modernization&quot; and militarism of the late-19th-century (with successful wars with first China, then with Russia just before and just after the turn of the 20th century).	2002-04-15

He then  describes levels of religious participation, including cross-island pilgrimages to the Mazho (Matsu in the old romanizaiton he uses) temple at Peikang. As much as he can, Sangren obscures that his data comes from Taiwan, not from China.<br /><br />Sangren criticizes overly schematic categorizations of spirits into the traditional tricohotomy gods, ghosts, and ancestors and questions the idea that the pantheons is modeled on an authoritarian central government (either the Kuomingtang dicatorship that ruled Taiwan at the time Sangred did his fieldwork or imperial Chinese governments that never had effective control of Taiwan before ceding the island to Japan in 1895). However, Sangren substitutes an equally a priori and rigidly schematic yin/yang contrasts to various phenomena and generalizes his structural analysis to all of China translating the terms Taiwanese used from Hokkien terms into Beijinghua \\"Mandarin\\" throughout. It is obvious that Sangren is far more interested in theorizing about a singular Chinese civilization than in observing and talking to the people he supposesdly was studying (Taiwanese).

She stresses the importance of informal neighborhood groupings of (unrelated) women and dwells extensively on prostitution, especially by adopted daughters (the obssession of Arthur Wolf's life work), and on rivalry between women. In particular, Margery Wolf stresses the rivalry between daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law as leading to the breakup of larger family units into nuclear family households (although in her earlier work she had  emphasized the fragility of bonds between brothers that  preexisted sister-in-law rivalry as a centripetal force within families ).<br />Wolf considerably  underestimated the extent to which women's work outside the house was (and is) important to  to the economic well-being of their families and to financing family enterprises. As Diamong complained, \\"there is little feel for how adult women view themselves and their lives, how they interact with the males in their lives, and how completely they accept the male evaluation of them as economically useless and ritually polluting.&quot; Taiwanese scholars have challenged the Western conception of female &quot;pollution&quot; in the work of Wolf, Emily [Martin] Ahern, and others.<br />The specificity of Wolf's _House of Lim_, although it probably depends on unnamed Taiwanese research &quot;assistants&quot; eliciting and translating the data, makes it the most useful of her books.	2002-04-03

He attributes the absence of lineage organization to the difficulties involved in collective ownership of property other than land and the ease of migration for those not tied to landholdings. (Many Taiwanese villages were exclusively or predominantly comprised of persons with the same surname. The one he studied was atypical in its mixture of surnames.)<br />Harrell  discusses the social and economic co-operation of unrelated persons, the simplification of ancestor worship in a locale without established lineage organizations, and the relatively higher status of women in a place where the household is the predominant unit of social organization. Rates of uxorilocal marriage are higher (15%) and rates of minor marriage are lower (35%) than in peasant villages in which the lineage is the major unit of social organization. Harrell attributes the relative lack of \\"dependency\\" symptoms (stratification and comprador capitalism) to the expansion of the (manufacturing) core to such villages, while avoiding examination of politics, local, national, or international. (In earlier work,  he credited  Japanese development of transport infrastructure and agriculture for providing the base for decentralized industrial  development.)	2002-04-03

She  gives special attention  to the local Lung-Shan temple and the pantheon of locally-recognized deities. K'un Shen at the time of her fieldwork during the 1960s  was characterized by weak agnatic groupings and a lack of corporate ownership of the means of production (fishing ponds, boats and equipment rather than land in this case).<br />A very concise account of the typical life cycle is followed by an incisive discussion of Japanese influence on matchmaking practices. Diamond also shows the fusion of lineages in worhip and a general reliance on non-kin exceptional markedly contrasts with \\"traditional [Confucian] China,\\" even though K'un Shen in the mid-1960s was not involved in the industrialization that affected many parts of the country.<br />In  \\"Fieldwork in a complex society,\\" pp. 113-141 in George Spindler, Being an Anthropologist (New York: Holt, 1970), discusses her fieldwork in a patriarchal society with written records by a young, female anthropologist, struggling to gain fluency in Hokkien and in \\"the national language\\" (&quot;Mandarin,&quot; the language of Beijing), and confronted by \\"many who find it difficult to understand why, with our power and influence, we [Americans] do not exert some kind of pressure to make Taiwan conform more to the democratic model, more like the ideal American that they believe exists.\\" She also noted that she failed to understand the extent to which those who had left the village still played a part in supporting the local temple and the families left behind in the village.	2002-04-03

Although Wolf makes a fanciful case that Taiwanese women's identities are obliterated by not using their names, she herself appropriated the work of the Taiwanese woman who did the research on a woman who was judged to be crazy rather than possessed by any deity and obliterated the name of the researcher.<br />Wolf's ignorance extends beyond ignorance of the language her subjects spoke (Holo/Hokkien) to ignorance about basic anthropological conceptions (terms of address in contrast to terms used in reference to a person, spirit mediums in contrast to shamans). There are no shamans in Taiwan. There are spirit mediums. Previous literature documented that some Taiwanese spirit mediums were female.<br />Wolf did not gather any data on Taiwanese criteria for recognizing true spirit possession, but even her inadequate 30-year-old fieldnotes provide ample material contradicting the &quot;conclusions&quot; (actually, a priori beliefs about female victimization) she presented.Instead of criticizing postmodernists, a better tactic, given her failures of scholarship and ethnography, would be to embrace it and abandon empirical claims altogether.	2002-03-29

He also wrote some articles for magazines and the ruminations on America for a book of photographs that was his last book (and which fills about a quarter of this collection).<br />Always he wrote about his impressions, primarily of people. The best pieces in this collection are not accounts of foreign wars but of people in distinct places. Like Steinbeck's life, the book begins with Salinas, California, continues through San Francisco and New York City to Sag Harbor on Long Island, where Steinbeck lived in the 1950s and 60s. In the \\"Journalist Abroad\\" section there are strong pieces on people in Positano and Ireland. And there is a section on friends (all male, of course) including a long memoir of his idol and naturalist mentor, Ed Ricketts, and short but very illuminating memoirs of the popular WWII correspondent Ernie Pyle and the photographer Robert Capa (who accompanied Steinbeck on his Russian visit), plus concise tributes to Adlai Stevenson as an orator and to Henry Fonda as an actor.<br />The section \\"On writing\\"  is regrettably short, and the selections of WWII colums from _Once There Was a War_ (a book which is in print) are mystifyingly missing the best ones, which Steinbeck wrote during the invasion of Italy. The Vietnam reports are unconvincing propaganda from what he presented as a war against Mao.

As much as Tesanovic despised what Milosovich and other Serbian nationalists were doing (in her name), she was also outraged by the casual acceptance of \\"collateral damage,\\" that is, the destruction of civilian targets (including one that counted: the PRC embassy in Belgrade) and killing of civilians by carefully targeted NATO (US) bombs.<br />Tesanovic uses \\"idiot\\" in an ancient Greek sense, as meaning a common personwho cannot be trusted to make public decisions: \\"I am unable to make judgements. I see no options I can identiy with.... All the political options sound aggressive, stupid or far-fetched compared to my simple needs\\" as a mother. \\"I don't feel safe here, or happy, or free. I'm a refugee in my own city.\\" Belgrade is/was a city with refugees from the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" of Croatia, even as Serbs engaged in \\"cleansing\\" of Serbia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. The Serbian nationalists considered Tesanovic a traitor; she considered them dangerously deluded and criminal. \\"In my country,\\" she wrote, \\"uniforms always take away the power of speech from citizens, because uinforms carry guns, and citizens carry fear, so there is a permanent civil war going on between uniforms and civilians.<br />Although she defended foreign intervention again national barbarism, she was far from enthusiastic about the sanctimoniousness of the forces of civilization.Her despairing analyses of those in Serbian and in UN uniforms are acute, but what is most fascinating about the book is the detail about everyday life: a female cousin dying of AIDS, other women deciding to have abortion from concern with the toxins they have been exposed to from bombed buildings, the children with no school getting bored and ever more unmanageable in the dark, intermitent electricity, visits from friends whose water supply has been cut off.ply has been cut off.	2002-02-12

Armstrong  aims to -- and largely succeeds -- in providing a comprehensible succinct outline of the history of the religion of Islam and of political regimes (including a series of empires) that are Muslim.  Armstrong covers 1400 years and a substantial part of the world in 187 pages of text. There are a lot of names and dates in the text, supplemented by a 31-page chronology, a nine-page dramatis personae, a four-page glossary of Arabic terms, and a nine-page topical bibliography. Is this too much information for readers unfamiliar with the subject to absorb? Yes. Even someone like me, who knows a fair bit about some parts of the story, can feel overwhelmed at the torrent of names and be tempted to regard the book as a reference to be dipped into rather than read through.<br />However, Armstrong is not just throwing names and dates at the reader. A narrative/analytic thread is quite visible. And the basic, recurring conflict between a radically egalitarian religious mandate and very inegalitarian political/social/economic relations in Muslim societies betraying the vision of the Prophet Muhammed (570-632) is of greater general interest now than it was when she wrote the book.<br />I have a great impatience with those who distinguish Christianity from what Christian institutions have done (Crusades, Inquisitions, etc.) or claim that Marxism has never been tried (i.e., that the communist states of the 20th century weren't \\"really\\" putting Marxism into practice). Being sometimes consistent, I think that so many failures of Islamic regimes to produce the kind of society Muhammed envisaged demonstrates its unfeasibility.(I am obviously not a Believer.)<br />I found Armstrong's account of the Mongol incursion particularly acute, that of the reaction to European colonialism a bit pat, but I highly recommend her acute analysis of the tension between what exists purporting to be Islamic and what the Quran says should be. This clash is the leitmotif of this splendid book.	2002-02-08

What Bejel has to say about the set of texts he discusses is almost always insightful, particularly about nuances of class differences and the long-running demonization of cities (paralleling the Jeffersonian tradition in the US). I am not convinced that some of the texts about which he writes (with the exception of &quot;Strawberry and chocolate&quot;) reflect or have shaped Cuban nation-building (even in the sense of developing an &quot;imagined community&quot;).  In addition to some doubts about the salience of some of the examples he selected I would have found more about the reception (especially any incorporation into standard Cuban school curricula) useful. Nonetheless, this is an outstanding and insight-filled reflection on homosexuality, homophobia, literature, and nation-building in Cuba from 1889 to 1997.	2002-01-15

To get the full force of this novel requires  familiarity with the character of Meto, Gordianus's adopted son and  prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Julius Caesar: the two books which I think are prerequisite are _Cataline's Riddle _  (which I consider the best book so far in the series) and _Rubicon_ (or, better, all seven previous novels in the series. I suspect the opening pages of this novel will not be very compelling to those who aren't already familiar with the Gordianus the Finder and his family of various ex-slaves.<br />The loyalty or lack of it of children to their parents is a major theme of the book. Gordianus is in Massillia at considerable risk to discover the fate of a son whose craftiness exceeded that of his father, but whose commitment to charismatic leaders unsettles his father. Gordianus seeks truth, Meto has cast his lot with someone seeking unprecedented power (and well on his way to attaining it). Spying in the service of an empire perhaps resonates differently now than it did a year ago when the book was published.<br />Saylor makes the institutions of the Greek city-state of Massillia (modern Marseilles) interesting, The decaying public virtue of Rome in the last years of its republic  and the willingness to cede freedom to a powerful leader promising security is intrinsically interesting to Americans two millennia and half a century later. That is, the Roma Sub Rosa series is not just escapist historical fiction.	2001-11-01

It  mixes structuralist analyses of the lifeways of the Kabyle  (an Algerian Bedouin group)  and some very unsystematic gleanings from more recent French and American research on gender.<br />Bourdieu claims that it is vital to investigate  _historical_ mechanisms for the dehistoricization/eternalization of dichotomous structuring by sex, but he totally avoids any systematic historical analysis and does not have any historical data. He also does not even consider the possibility that some division by sex might be natural (biologically based) rather than &quot;naturalized&quot; (arbitrary arrangements misrecognized as being from nature).<br />In addition to recycling structuralist analysis of  Kabyle honor (vs. shame) and repeating  oracular dicta about misrecognition, symbolic violence, etc., Bourdieu attached an appendix about gay/lesbian movements. It is obvious that he knows very little about the movements, the research literature on them, or about lesbian or gay couples.<br />I am tempted to deliver the famed verdict that what is new in this book is not sound and what is sound is not new.  Although I think that Bourdieu repeats rather than develops what he wrote about domination during the 1970s, his focus (in theory, if not often in practice) on embodied,  reproduction of domination remains important -- and undeveloped herein.	2001-10-26

The most interesting part is a sketch of the author's background--as a child of a Sephardic Jewish family that had been in Morocco for four centuries. He assumed he was destined for greatness (as a writer) and sees this as a sort of ontogeny for the phylogeny of the Chosen People. Both as a 20th-century Jew and as someone who (like Camus) feels lost the paradise of living under the North African sun (living in the dingy, gray Paris of the 1950s), he believes he has a duty to remember.<br />The book about his nonbooks (the books he didn't write) starts over and starts over and starts over, but, aided by some  very apposite quotations about writing  from myriad other writers, details the ultimately impossible love of an author who can not bring himself to besmirch beautiful virgin sheets of white paper even to create the literature that would redeem his claim to be a writer.<br />Many people have realized that being unsuited for writing and even unable to string more than a few words together does not remove the desire to be a writer. Without venturing beyond the struggle with writing ) B?nabou makes being a writer who does not and cannot write archly funny and even poignant.	2001-10-22

It is an implausible and arbitrary tale of a well-to-do couple living in Manhattan who met in a counter-intelligence/propaganda program during World War II. The wife thinks she has seen a man who was a Nazi double agent working in a shoe store, though he was supposed to have died long ago.<br /><br />I find it impossible to believe in or care about any of the characters in this typically short (139-page) Spark novel, and the ending rivals that of (her fellow convert to Catholicism) G. K. Chesterton's _The Man Who Was Friday_ for unsatisfactoriness. A side-plot on vaguely &quot;shock the bourgeoisie&quot; off-Broadway theater of the early 1970s adds more yawns, as does a ridiculout psychiatrist turned butler.<br /><br /> This novel from Spark's doldrum period deserves to stay out of print, whereas most of her novels from _The Abbess of Crewe_ (1974) through _Far Cry_ (1988) and her pre-1970s novels continue to provide pleasures and insights to readers and deserve to be in print and read.	2001-10-11

The other (&quot;Geoffrey&quot;) is set in the Toronto gay subculture of the 1950s, before &quot;the personal is political&quot; was conceived. It is a vivid representation of the pressures of connecting for encounters that were crimes then. It also makes the need for sponsorship to gain entr&eacute;e to the circuit of posh parties and the recourse to alcohol to overcome inhibitions palpable. Besides making &quot;the bad old days&quot; of homosexual alcoholism comprehensible to a post-liberation generation, it includes a poignant romance and even some hot sex.<br /><br /> Characters--or at least genealogical lines--run from story to story. Mac, the male ingenue brought into Toronto gay high society by Geoffrey, is a child fascinated by playing Monopoly, in the first story, 1938, though it is primarily about Mac's mother co-opting her communist lover to her husband's liberal political machine.<br /><br /> Mac, like the author born in 1930, is a politically savvy junior English department faculty member at the University of Windsor, ca. 1968-69 in the title story. Mac is active in trying to get a popular fired teacher reinstated. The teacher is sold out by some supposed &quot;radicals&quot; who are only interested in the man as a symbol and who cooperate in discrediting Mac as crazy.<br /><br /> &quot;Raid&quot; features the mobilization to protest the police raid on Toronto bathhouses in 1981. It features a closeted gay official in the Ministry of Justice involved in planning the raids, an undercover police agent, the son of the communist from the first story as a streetwise organizer of the protests, and various self-styled radicals with no sense of the grassroots gay men they claim to speak for.<br /><br /> The final (and most paranoid) story brings back the policeman, whose interest in the supposed suicide of a professor at the Ontario Art College (where the author long taught) revisits a struggle over expression vs. craft with geopolitical roots. Although we have learned that what once seemed beyond paranoid fantasy was often happening with CIA (etc.) infiltrations, agents provocateurs, etc., what I find most unbelievable in this final story is the confession of the operative.<br /><br /> The leitmotifs of the collection are that there are leftists who are more interested in appearing radical than they are in getting results, that symbolic politics is the only kind that interests them, and that North American governments infiltrated and influenced to self-destruct pretty much every organization, however ad hoc, protesting anything during the second half of the twentieth century.<br /><br /> Personally, I am more interested in the two stories set in gay Toronto (of 19581 and 1981) than in the Byzantine politics within Ontario colleges (though Grube links the battles within academia to larger-scale political combat and the stories are in the paranoid thriller genre &agrave; la Jonh Grisham).

He does not seem to have systematically gathered data on sexual behavior (or, indeed, anything else), but provides his impressions and value judgments based on conversations he has had with some Cubans and reading about Cuba. From the perspective of a long-time apologist for the regime who is troubled by its continued suppression of any civil society or culture outside direct supervision by the state, he writes about changes over time in official  attempts to eliminate or control homosexuality and about popular attitudes about male homosexuality and gender.<br /><br /> As Cuba became a dependent neo-colony within the Soviet Empire, focus on growing more of a single crop (sugar cane) for export intensified. Rounding up \\"anti-social deviants\\" provided cheap labor for state-run sugar plantations, isolated rebels (sexual and other kinds), and was rationalized as therapeutic, in the same way as sending Chinese urban intellectuals to till fields was supposed to redeem them during the Cultural Revolution. After the involuntary Military Units to Aid Production (UMAP) camps were closed, homosexuals continued to be banned from many occupations.<br /><br /> Lumsden does not mention the practice of a variant of aversion therapy used on effeminate boys . He also fails to note the continuity in assumptions, rationales, and administration of the UMAP concentration camps and the &quot;sidatoria&quot; to which persons testing positive for HIV antibodies were involuntarily removed, starting in 1986. Both kinds of concentration camps were initially run by the army. Both were premised on removing potential contagion. Despite the difficulties of life outside, since confiable (trustworthy) inmates were allowed to move out in 1994, none have chosen to return even to the showplace-sidatorium. This  shows that freedom from paternalistic control is important to Cubans, not only to those in more individualistic societies.<br /><br /> With the collapse of its patron, the USSR, and the concomitant loss of market and loss of subsidies, the Cuban economy all but collapsed. Foreign tourism, has been actively sought, and concessions have been made to sex tourism. Prostitution has revived. Hard-currency gay discos have been tolerated. And the interest in the immensely popular film \\"Fresa y chocolate\\" has demonstrated that the Cuban people's intolerance of homosexuals (even effeminate ones) has been exaggerated in claims by Castro and his subordinates that the people would not accept representations of homosexuality as tolerable.<br /><br /> This book is much better written than Lumsden's (1991) book on Mexico, but similarly deficient in recognition of empirical work on Latin American homosexualities.<br /><br /> Although  Lumsden recurrently produces special pleading (writing that the object of this or that repression was \\"not homosexuality per se\\"), he is certainly right to note that the records of the other states in the Western hemisphere for permitting positive representations of homosexuality, providing realistic HIV-prevention education, and caring for persons with AIDS have been inadequate, and also that there have been changes in Cuban policies.

Especially hilarious is Feiler's account of preparations for a junior high school fieldtrip to Disneyland that included setting up chairs and practicing getting on and off the bus efficiently. (Japanese tour groups seem to me to spend a lot of time hovering around outside their busses.) Assembling for group photos at every stop is another activity I have noticed preoccupying Japanese tour groups in Hawai'i and California.. Japanese ritualism and indirect speech make more sense here than in, say, in James Kirkup's condscending memoirs . Feiler does not overklook Japanese ethnocentrism (not just we're best but we are so totally unique), nor does he recognize some of his own. Cho, a friend, tells Feiler: \\"Everybody says our students have to learn to live in a world that is larger than Japan. But, first, our teachers have to learn that such a world exists\\"<br />The rural Japanese are continually astounded that an alien can speak Japanese, use chopsticks, and in some ways seems more traditionally Japanese than they are -- though such statements are probably more formulaic than Feiler notices. Nevertheless, he mostly deserves the tributes he receives for trying to understand and respect Japanese lifeways -- and for writing so engagingly about his experiences and feelings there.<br />Along with Lydia Minatoya's _Talking to High Monks_ (only partly about Japan),  and John Treat's _Great Mirror Shattered_, this is my favorite book of Americans recounting extended visits to Japan.	2001-06-20

The clean-cut all-American boy Bob Smith was probably an altar boy (as well as being an alter-boy). The son of a heavy-drinking New York State trooper and a devoutly Catholic mother, he grew up in Buffalo. The book begins and ends with visits to his hometown, accompanied by his life-partner Tom. They also visit Tom's parents in their Florida retirement home, survive a hurricane that strikes Provincetown and two bouts of couples counseling. Being a professional comedian, Smith finds plenty that is funny about these events and nonevents. Some of the quips fall flat, and he sometimes drives metaphors into the ground, but his enjoyment at playing with language is infectious, and even the outright jokes are usually based on keen perception of the absurdities of his own life and the society around him.<br /><br /> Smith's humor is genial, even when aimed at attitudes and behavior that deeply annoy him. Whereas David Sedaris sometimes strikes me as vicious (though I'm sure he'd label his extremes &quot;Swiftian&quot; and dismiss Smith as a gay Thurber), Smith's bile drains somewhere other than in his writing.My favorite chapter is the one that verges on talking about sex (something many other gay comics focus upon, but Smith all but ignores), &quot;A Few Notes on Sex Education.&quot;<br /><br /> It seems that he comes by his optimism naturally, since his mother tells his sister &quot;Just because you're coming home for your father's funeral, doesn't mean that we can't have fun.&quot;<br /><br /> The book is _not_ a string of one-liners. It is a collection of keenly observed essays on a number of facets of American life (in a range of places I've already enumerated). They are connected primarily  by how Bob Smith sees and describes the world, but most of the book coheres around one monogamous gay couple and their extended families (&quot;The terms 'immediate' and 'extended' are apt because my immediate family can cause instant mood swings and my extended family is better kept at a distance&quot;).

Battered from continent to continent by political events of the twentieth century, Dorfman's survival  (as he knows well) depended on considerable luck and on his father's connections. Although he has accepted that his vocation is to tell stories, especially the stories of repression in Chile, there is no doubt that he harbors a considerable amount of survivor guilt.<br />Contrary to the misrepresentation of earlier reviewers, Dorfman does mention Borges (three times, all with respect), criticizes Castro as well as Pinochet (though Chile is a place to which he gave his heart and soul), and is not just aware, but explicit that it is ironic &quot;I should  have become a spokesperson for the poor in Latin America because I had spent so many years in the rich North&quot; and of the recurrent ironies that the connections of his marxist father got them out of harm's way.<br />This is a very honest, un-narcissistic account of an interesting life of multiple exiles, observing failures of democracies, making clear the different selves that emerge in different languages. I would have liked more on the second American exile and assenting to bilingualism, and I regret that the hardback cover composition was replaced by the duller, less bicultural one on the paperback.	2001-05-28

In contrast to the novels produced at the time, _Golden Boy _has a protagonist who exists by day as well as by night, and even tries to establish a career. The book provides insight into the little-understood phenomenon of sponsoring the young and pretty, even when they refuse to put out. The ugly duckling boy from Dubuque, Iowa becomes first a Minneapolis model and then is passed on to well-connected New Yorkers who help him become an investment banker, the prorotypical occupation of the greedy Reagan era.

She notes classical traditions in which Achilles's bond to Patroklos was erotic, and also a murderous unrequited passion for Troilos, but does not elaborate on these (nor on the Amazon queen Penthesileia), focusing primarily on the accretion of later romantic entanglements with Polyxena, the last virgin of the Trojan royal family.<br /><br />The book is primarily a passionate recovery of the tragedy of Achilles from later allegorizing simplifications. Besides providing a fascinating demonstration of the tangle of traditions growing out of one character in a nearly lost text, the book is of special value for those trying to understand cultural constructions of gender and sexuality for showing the assumption that enthusiastic heterosexuality effeminized a man. Traditions of Achilles as an ardent heterosexual suitor have him undertaking women's work (like Herakles) and even cross-dressing. While love with Patroklos was masculinizing for the young warrior, falling in love with Deidameia \\"is not merely the result of assumed effeminacy that allows him to move freely among beautiful maidens but is the cause of that effeminacy\\" (p. 182).  The opposition between effeminate lover and masculine warrior is often a contrast between Paris and Achilles, but by the 2nd century A. D., the contrast was made in phases of Achilles's career. In the Illiad  itself \\"only in Achilles does k&aacute;llos  [a stunning and sexually enticing beauty attributed by Homer also to Paris and to Ganymede] coexist with all the other excellences that a man and a warrior are expected to have if he is to be called &aacute;ristos\\"  (p. 4).<br /><br />The book's 23 illustrations are also fascinating, but, unfortunately, not discussed.

Likoksy endeavored to include material on Asia and Africa, though it tends to be by/about Asians and Africans in Britain and the US.

I also think that his nonfiction is better than much of his fiction. His dispatches from England, Algiera, Italy, and PT-boats in the Mediterranean are often insightful, and frequently funny, especially the essay on souvenirs and the in the finale, a multi-part account of tricking a garrison into surrendering.<br />Steinbeck was very clear that he did not capture the essence of battle. Indeed, he wrote very clearly about the self-protective amnesia that descends after traumatic experiences (198-200).<br />What should have been the most important part of the book collecting his 1942-43 reporting, the introduction, seems to have been skipped by some readers. \\"We were all a part of the War Effort,\\" Steinbeck recalled in 1958. \\"We went along with it, and not only that, we abetted it. Gradually it became a part of all of us that the truth about anything was automatically secret and that to trifle with it was to interfere with the War Effort. By this I don't mean that the correspondents were liars. They were not. In the pieces in this book everything set down happened. It is in the things not mentioned that the truth lies\\" Whether he was fully aware that he was producing propaganda when he filed the dispatches (which were censored as well as self-censored), Steinbeck was candid: \\"We edited ourselves much more than we were edited. We felt responsible to what was called the home front. There was a general feeling that unless the home front was carefully protected from the whole account of what war was like, it might panic. Also we felt we had to protect the armed services from criticism, or they might retire to their tents to sulk like Achilles. . . . Yes, we wrote only a part of the war, but at the time we believed, fervently believed, that it was the best thing to do. And perhaps that is why, when the war was over, novels and stories by ex-soldiers, like The Naked and the Dead, proved so shocking to a public which had been carefully protected from contact with the crazy hysterical mess\\".

In the year covered by the book she also makes or recalls visits to a number of other sites, mostly in western Sicily, and draws on many earlier accounts of how festivals were celebrated in ancient Magna Grecia and in 18th and 19th century Sicily.<br />Although preoccupied with ancient Greek celebrations, particularly their botanical foci, and with the disappearances and revivals of Sicilian folk culture, Simeti's account does not ignore the Mafia. 1992 was the year in which General dalla Chiesa and his young wife wereassassinated. Outrage at that marked the beginning of public condemnation of the Mafia and the violence that culminated in the 1996 assassinations of the magistrates investigating the Mafia was escalating. (And 1993 was the year that a lava flow from Mt. Etna was diverted by dynamite.)<br />Focusing on Demeter and Persephone has a clear feminist agenda. Simeti expresses eloquently her ambivalence as an expatriate American (of 20 years standing at the time), alternately enchanted and infuriated by Sicilian ways. I was particularly struck by the more widespread (than Sicily) resentment at \\"living in a world where rite and tradition are becoming ever more a private affair that has fallen squarely into the woman's lap\\" (66-- I know that ancestor worship is similarly being increasingly dumped on wives in Taiwan, for another instance).<br />The characters are not as clear as those in _Out of Africa_ or _Cross Creek_, but in writing engagingly about residence in a land that is strange to the author, Simeti deserves a place on the shelf with those much-loved classics.	2001-02-14

Robb writes with considerable insight about Sicilian cuisine, the great Sicilian writers Giuseppe di Lampedusa and Leonardo Sciascia, and the most famous Sicilian painter Renato Guttuso. His main focus and the raison d'être for his return to Italy (he earlier lived in Naples and Sicily for fourteen years) was the beginning of the trial of Giulio Andreotti, the most powerful politician in postwar Italy, lifetime senator, minister in most postwar Italian governments,  and prime minister seven times.<br />Robb has serious criticisms of the public stances and effects of Sciascia and Guttuso, but there are also genuine heroes in his exceedingly dark narrative, specifically, the martyred magistrates Giovanni Falcone, Paolo Borsellino, carabinieri General Carlo Dalla Chiesa, anti-corruption crusading Palermo mayor (now Minister of the Interior) Leoluca Orlando, and the Countess Marzotto (Gussoto's mistress, muse, and recurrent subject).<br />The way the book keeps returning to Andreotti and Riina and the proliferation of names of less prominent Mafiosi and officials (not that these are distinct sets!) makes it difficult to follow, and demands a high level of commitment by readers to keeping the pieces straight - even though, as in Sciascia's fiction, the pieces of the puzzle are anything but clear and straightforward. The difficulty of following the narrative is further complicated by long discourses on Naples. Robb fails to connect the organized crime syndicates in Naples and Palermo except insofar as both are parts of the nation of Italy that is deeply compromised by Andreotti and his allies.<br />Although the book has a partial list of characters, it desperately needs an index so that readers can refresh their memory of who's who. Since he is writing about extremely murky realities, the plotline cannot be completely clear, but a more straightforward exposition is imaginable. It also needs an epilogue now that the Andreotti trial (the beginning of which Robb returned to Sicily for) has ended.<br />There is a great deal of information - not just on political/criminal collaboration but on other aspects of Sicily - in this book. I amd glad that I did not read it before going to Sicily, but it makes for fascinating reading after leaving the island that Lampedusa considered eternally exploited and misgoverned. For reading in advance or while there, I'd recommend Mary Simeti's _On Persephone's Island, instead.ilogue now that the Andreotti trial (the beginning of which Robb returned to Sicily for) has ended.<br />There is a great deal of information - not just on political/criminal collaboration but on other aspects of Sicily - in this book.

It not only brings the Turbins, a bourgeois family in Kiev, to life, but shows what it is like for decent, intelligent, idealistic people to live through a civil war on the losing side. (In the stage of the civil war covered in the novel, the Bolsheviks hardly figure at all; Bulgakov left before the Red Army triumphed.)<br /><br />Not as romantic as _Dr. Zhivago_, _White Guard_ focuses more on the collapse of the old order without portraying the replacement of any new one. It is not as daring and free-wheeling as _The Master and the Margarita_, but shows that M&M was no fluke.<br /><br />Bulgakov was a very great writer whose work (like Pasternak's) was massively interfered with by the commisars of literature in the USSR--and by Stalin himself (who personally banned Bulgakov's play about another set of those on the losing side of the revolution, &#34;Flight&#34;).	2001-02-06

The narrator is guided by and confirms many of her analyses of places and histories and also portrays an international cast of fellow travelers (a French couple with a child, a Japanese couple, and various English types). What the narrator and Martine write is mostly perspicacious both about Sicily and about traveling.  Reading the book is like joining the conversation between Martine and the narrator about Sicily and seems a better book to read after one has some experience of the island to compare to the impressions of the now-dead Durrell and the long-dead Martine.<br />(The occasional poems are underwhelming, though I like the line &quot;They also die who only sit and wait.&quot;)	2001-02-01

Indeed, he is deeply offended by most everyone. &quot;Meticulous&quot; finds a place in his limited English vocabulary; &quot;fastidious&quot; would have been even more fitting. It's impossible not to feel sorry for Boontakorn, but his judgements of his father are so harsh that it's hard to like him. It is completely plausible that a traumatized adolescent would judge his father and other relatives this way, but Andrew Pham's _Catfish and Mandala_ shows more of the prime Buddhist virtue, compassion, in another catalog of devastation in and getting out of Southeast Asia.	2000-09-27

The convergence of the three &quot;Wise Men&quot; stretches disblief, but what gave me the most difficulty was believing that the FBI would send someone undercover with as little &quot;basic training&quot; (like, say vocabulary drill) or backgrounding as Raider has, and that anyone could cover up such ignorance.<br /><br /> Some of the characters (Freedom, Deon) were developed; others (Jasper, Bruce, and the way-too-unsuspicious Othello) were insufficiently developed (with Raider somewhere in between).

Not knowing the play, I had to skip the chapter on Measure for  Measure, but found the interpretations of Hal and Falstaff, Romeo and  Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, and the Winter's Tale intriguing. They seem  to me to be a little long on plot detail, particularly in the last  instance, but what Bloom wrote about Ulysses, Hector, Antony, Falstaff,  Mercurtio, Romeo, Friar Laurance, and Prospero is at least tenable. And he  is particularly acute about Juliet, Prospero, Octavius, Achilles, and  Falstaff.<br /><br /> I am not convinced that Shakepeare was so conscious a  political theorist as Bloom supposes, systematically surveying different  kinds of political communities. (That was Aristotle!). or illustrating  Machiavelli (that was Leo Strauss and his students such as Bloom)  Shakespeare certainly portrayed a range of human relationships, though with  some more reucrrent patterns than one would guess from reading Bloom.<br /><br /> In particular, I think that Bloom fails to examine the generally  one-way erotics of many friends disappointed by being abandoned for  wedlock. There is very little representation of what happens after the  weddings which are the \\"happy endings\\" for some youth, while disasters flow  from established marital and quasi-marital relationships in Macbeth, Antony  and Cleopatra, Hamlet,  Othello, and even Romeo and Juliet, including the  deaths of all the title characters in these plays.<br /><br /> Bloom's notion  that Rome's imperial expansion was over by the time Octavius defeated  Antony is very peculiar. Is it that there is no great literature about  Trajan than makes Bloom ignore the later imperial growth? There was no \\"end  of politics\\" or shortage of enemies, internal or external, for later  emperors to contend against.<br /><br /> As an introduction to Bloom's values  and ways of thinking about canonical texts, this volume is far superior to  Saul Bellow's fictionalized memoir, _Ravelstein_. _Shakespeare's Politics_  is even better an introduction.alized memoir, _Ravelstein_. _Shakespeare's Politics_  is even better an introduction.	2000-08-03

Even the best (and first) of them significantly  misrepresents. Kaplan shows the defense attorney producing a lofty,  incomprehensible-to-the-jurors plea, but \\"Brasillach's insistence on  rambling on for days  ensured his death sentence\\" is totally wrong. The  whole trial was done in a day. Brasillach declined to make the closing  speech that was his right. When he spoke at length was in the interrogation  by the magistrate, the first stage, which Brasillach dominated. (I do agree  with Kenyon that there should be photos of the main characters though.).<br /><br /> Guernseybookman is viciously mistaken that &quot;A  critic of our  own generation might be more likely to ask how many homosexuals were drawn  into the resistance out of disgust with Vichy's family values&quot; is dumb  and anachronistic. It is a statement about possible present perspectives  which Kaplan is DIRECTLY CONTRASTING  to  those of 1945. Moreover, she is  exceptionally careful to distinguish the widespread perception that  Brasillach was homosexual from any direct evidence that he was (or that the  judge, a \\"lifelong bachelor\\" with a longer life was). No male sexual  partners have been revealed, and from the amount of writing Brasillach did  and the pallidness of personal experience portrayed in  his fiction, one  can easily believe that he had no sex life.<br /><br /> I sort of agree with  the anonymous Mass. reader that \\"it is not at all clear from Ms.Kaplan's  book why Brasillach was considered such a great talent,\\" but this is in  large part because she is NOT a postmodernist, unwilling to make  judgments  of literary worth. She forthrighlt  criticizes Brasillach's novels for  their sentimentality and the remoteness of their narrators from human  (especially sexual) experience.  Kaplan does explain why Camus and other  Resistance writers sought clemency for Brasillach, including praise of his  writing that she obviously does not concur with. And Kaplan shows how an  assumption of homosexuality and a link between homosexuality and  worshipping fascist domination was used by the prosecutor. This analysis is  not at all anachronistic.<br /><br /> I don't see that there is any relevance  of the case for American hate crimes, since the latter are not about  publications that are complicit with conquerors (unless someone is writing  advocating killing Native Americans), though there are analogies to South  Africa.<br /><br /> OK, the book is not as luminous and tightly packed as  FRENCH LESSONS. Not many books are!<br /><br /> This book sometimes seems  rambling. And there are some repetitions from earlier chapters in the  chapter on the trial (the author expecting readers to skip them?). And it  is not true that one can find out anything with research. For instance,  Kaplan did not find out the jury vote or whether the prosecutor held the  defense attorney's speech against him. And she seems oddly reticent to  press what seems to me the most compelling reason to execute Brasillach:  the precedent of his own arguments for executing the leaders of the Third  Republic. She notes that his complicity with genocide was not pressed by  the prosecution, but it also seems that there was not careful demonstration  that those he denounced (in print) were rounded up by the Nazis. There was  a rush to judgment, even though I come away thinking the judgment was  right.<br /><br /> I am surprised that a Duke literature professor does not  discuss \\"performative\\" speech (&agrave; la John Austin, not Judith Butler) and  disappointed she does not comment at all on the treatment of the WWII  treasons of an indisputably major writer, Ezra Pound. But at least she does  render her own final judgment on the case. I don't think that the book  entirely gells, but it includes many interesting analyses and a clear  narrative of a very slippery case.ery case.	2000-08-03

I  was also frustrated by the third-person narration. (It's fine for a  first-person narrator not to understand what makes a major character tick,  but if the perspective is one character's, I think it should be told in  first person.)<br />I also thought there was too much pseudo-sociological  comment about differences between Latino and Anglo ways of living and  seeing the world, that this should be shown, not told.<br />However, I also  thought there were many insights -- insights into characters, locales  (especially the exotic one of American universities for the  long-expatriated author/protagonist), and the ways of love.<br />I found the  anonymous (typically anonymous!) Ohio reviewer's statement &quot;The  characters changed their morals as quickly as they changed their  shirt&quot; deeply and viciously wrong. Austin continues to support both  the &quot;lover&quot; with whom he's not having sex (and has not known very  long before his jealth problems begin) and an ex-lover with whom he has not  had sex in many years. Austin is deeply loyal to those he has loved and  takes on HUGE responsibilities for two EXCEPTIONALLY demanding dying men.  That he has other desires is not a variation from his morality, which is to  try to enhance the quality of life and experience of those he cares about.

The scene of the queen and Blunt which was  played so well by Prunella Scales and Edward (or was it James?) Fox in the  BBC production is brilliantly written. Bennett is, indeed, a master at  writing lines that give away or seem to give away more than the character  understands-or seems to understand. The audience knows best with the  &quot;artless&quot; talking heads, but neither Blunt nor the audience can  be quite sure if the queen has toyed with him or is as straightforward and  concerned with concrete facts as she presents herself as being. &quot;Who  did what?&quot; is also very much in question in the &quot;Titians&quot;  Blunt is examining and in the puzzle of who was running the spies who were  eventually revealed.	2000-07-21

D., a former professor who specialized in _The Song of Roland_ and  has survived imprisonment, the death of his beloved wife, and years of  civil war, has been sent to contract coal by a government that is not  specifially identified as the Spanish Republic beset by a civil war in  which the anti-government side has the support of what is not specifically  identified as Nazi Germany. He runs into L., the rebel forces' agent many  times. He inspires fierce loyalty from two Englishwomen, and dodges  bullets, double-crosses, a major explosion, the police, and trumped-up  murder charges. There are farcical interludes at an Entrenationo  (Esperanto) school and dangerous whiffs of precocious female sexuality  (something of a Greene leitmotif). It is an odd book, with the multiple  failures of D's mission oddly exhilirating. Some have read it as  anti-Semitic.

Dazai, like many Tanizaki characters, shows that a good analysis is only a good analysis, not a means  to change. He did not lack for insight into his pathologies, and he wrote  with considerable wit about his self-defeating and self-destructive  patterns (especially parasitism, lack of any ability to associate with  others casually, alcoholism, and, for a time, addiction to pain-killer  medication). Dazai sounds like a wittier version of the European Romantic  artist suffering on the road to suicide, not made for the crass world, but  feeling less superior to it than European romantics.<br /><br />Like many  bright provincials, he went to the metropolis, Tokyo. \\"To this charmless,  featureless plain, people from all over Japan roll up in droves to push and  shove and sweat, to fight for an inch of ground, to live lives of  alternating joy and sorrow, to regard one another with jealous, hostile  eyes, females crying out to males, males merely strutting about in a  frenzy.\\"<br /><br /> As boorish as was the figure of himself that he wrote,  and as debunking of many verities, there is still something delicate in his  perceptions as in both his resistance to the cult of Mount Fuji and how he  is affected by it and by other natural phenomena. \\"One hundred views of  Mount Fuji\\" and \\"Eight scenes of Tokyo\\" are self-lacerating, but not wholly  self-absorbed.

I can see that perhaps _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_ is a  satire, and _The Abbess of Crewe_ surely is. Most of Spark's work is short  and has considerable bit. She herself labeled _The Public Image_ &quot;an  ethical shocker,&quot; but I'm even less sure of what that means than I am  whether the book is intended to satirize or portray a rising film star  whose public image is threatened.<br /><br /> I also don't agree with the  cover description of Annabel having &quot;made the fatal mistake of  believing her public image.&quot; It seems to me that she knows what that  image is and how to maintain it and recognizes the rewards she reaps from  it, but that she has not confused her self with her image/typical role.<br /><br /> The two main adult female characters are admirably poised and  fully ethical. The two main male characters are needy, greedy heels jealous  of Annabel's success. There is a harridan female child and some  professionally supportive males (a director and a lawyer), so it's not  entirely women good men bad, but the bad men are very destructive indeed.<br /><br /> The local (Roman) color is amusing and the ending is very  satisfying.

Schell also writes about the effort to film  &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; with many Tibetan exiles, including the  sister of the Dalai Lama. Both historical films were commercial and  artistic failures, but the fascination of the books is with the industry  involved rather than with the product.<br /><br /> What I find most  interesting are the discussions Schell had with Tibetans on location in  Argentina. The reader knows that their hopes are not going to be realized.  And the author knows that the hopes of American Tibetophiles are not going  to be realized. He is impatient with the pretentions of some, particularly  (and justifiably!) Steven Seagal. I don't see how anyone can read him as  being unsympathetic to the plight of Tibetans, whether they are refugees in  diaspora or colonized in Tibet.<br /><br />While I do not Schell is an  apologist for PRC colonialism, his pessimism may foster Chinese goals by  making opposition seem futile. In particular,  I think that Schell  underestimates Tibetans' persistence. The survival and revival of  Christianity in the Soviet Union should encourage caution about  pulverization. Fifteen years ago, who thought that apartheid could end  without a bloodbath or that communists would surrender power in elections  in Eastern Europ? Nonetheless, I also think that many Western admirers of  Tibetan culture/religion underestimate the will to domination of the  colonialist PRC and the need of the illegitimate Chinese communist party to  wrap itself in nationalism and spurious claims to any territory ever  controlled by any earlier dynasty.<br /><br /> Given Schell's interest in the  authenticity of Hollywood representation of Tibet in the 1940s and 50s, it  is disappointing that he focused on &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; rather  than &quot;Kundun&quot; in which Tibetans are more than glorified extras  and in which no blond American movie star is there to distract the viewer.  (Schell says that he went for the bigger-budget production because he was  interested in Hollywood commodification of Tibet. Probably book-buyers are  also more interested in Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, and Steven  Seagal, so Schell's decision has its own sound commercial instincts...)<br /><br /> Along with reporting on how Tibet is used and projected onto by  movie folks and on the experience of plaster recreations of Lhasa in the  Andes, Schell discusses Harrer at length and also runs through earlier  Western visitors to &quot;the roof the world&quot; and how their reports  were read by seekers of a kingdom of the spirit on earth. This survey may  not be rigorous or original, but surely it will introduce this travel  literature to many readers.ven Years in Tibet&quot; rather  than &quot;Kundun&quot; in which Tibetans are more than glorified extras  and in which no blond American movie star is there to distract the viewer.

The characters are vivid, including the narcissistic misogynist gay  neo-con, an apparent combination of David Brock and Andrew Sullivan with  whom the narrator has an affair that involves no meeting of minds. (I'd  have to grant that the smirking Ralph Reed character is cardboard.) The  somewhat-Kafkaesque second half of the novel is more plot-driven, but is  still heavily character-driven in ways very reminiscent of Michael Nava  (though Attorny Diaz is mostly a cipher to the narrator, he seems not  unlike Henry Rios).	2000-06-20

It is followed by a grimmer variant of _As I Lay Dying_. With some echoes of _Steppenwolf_, the spirtualist  pianist and the moralistic ex-slave he loves move from New York to Europe  and land in Anne Rice territory when they cross the Bosphorus. Fitz/Dr.  August seems a bit anachronistic in his insights and his syntax, but these  make for easier reading in the 21st century. Bram skillfully brings a range  of mileux to life, as well as a  family that is very nontraditional in many  ways, but is also very Victorian in the mix of devotion, frustration, and  loneliness.<br /><br /> I nearly stopped reading a third of the way through  when Alice's tedious diaries seemed to be taking over from the narrator,  but am very glad that I persisted. Many of the backdrops are glitzy, but  the central relationships of this inter-racial triangle are seriously  limned. At least this reader longs to know what Tristan makes of this  narrative of his background-- although Christopher Bram seems far to  protean a novelist to undertake a sequel.	2000-06-20

Jones in writing his memoir, from hearing him speak (including reading from the book) I know that the voice in it is his and am fairly confident that he  decided what incidents and topics to include. Jones has long been an openly  gay dancer and choreographer, and more recently an openly HIV+ one  slandered as perpetrating \\"victim art\\" (by a critic long hostile to him who  condemned while refusing to see \\"Still/here,\\" his attempt to craft a piece  about living with terminal diseases).<br /><br />Jones is acutely aware of his  body and the fetishization of the body of the big, black stud. He plays  with that objectification on-stage and off without forgetting its cost. \\"My  eroticism, my sensuality is often coupled with wild anger and  belligerence,\\" he says. \\"I know that I can be food for fantasy, but at the  same time I am a person with a history-and that history is in part the  history of exploitation.\\"<br /><br /> It is what Jones does with his own (and  others') bodies on stage, not just his physical appearance, upon which he  wants to focus the interest of many: \\"The performer who takes the stage  must believe that he is fascinating, that he or she deserves being the  locus of several hundred or thousand points of attention. . . . The  performer wants to be one of many, but even more, he wants to command the  attention of many.\\"<br /><br /> As I already said, Jones's voice comes through  on the page. The book is compelling as a narrative of an interesting life  in a difficult time (the time of AIDS to which Jones lost his partner on-  and off-stage) and as an account of the wellsprings of Jones's art.	2000-06-11

Books	3	13	19	N	N	heavy-handed game-playing	To get all the book's humor requires not only having read the collected works of Vladimir Nabokov, but all the idiotic things forgotten reviewers wrote about his work. Vadim, the Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; narrator is a parody of  misconceptions - at least what Nabokov considered misconceptions - of his  character, in particular, that he must have been a pederast . Nabokov was  playing with various imaginable pasts for someone with his general  background, but his play seems to me to be as heavy-handed as his narrator  is incapable of happiness in any of his relationships. Compared to its  immediate predecessors (the seemingly endless Ada, and the brief but opaque  Transparent Things) Look at the Harlequins is readable, but for me the last  novels are a marked decline from his earlier masterpieces.<br /><br /> There  are certainly pleasures in the text and flashes of wit, but overall the  fictional memoir of a passive cloddish alter ego is a disappointment, a  not-very-fun series of games and in-jokes. It seems to me that Vadim  understood but cannot implement the title's command. At least he doesn't  enjoy those he manages to see as harlequins there to amuse him.	2000-06-11

Here it is the British  Museum.<br /><br />  The attempted &quot;thriller&quot; part is entertaining,  and involves a hilarious visit to the Soviet Union for the novel's hero.  The murder mystery is, perhaps, the least interesting of the mysteries in  the book, and Fitzgerald was wise to abandon trying to be a genre novelist.  Better to show the clashings of incompatible ways of being and doing. But  the generic parts are fairly entertaining, and the compassion of the  novelist for the butterflies she pins to the page is palpable already in  her first novel.	2000-06-11

He is especially good at writing about lost love-starved Brits. (Money in Kureishi's tales has much of the abstractness that money has for me. In  contrast, drugs are something he knows!)<br /><br /> \\"The flies\\" is a failure  attempting to write a Kafkaesque parable. Not just a failure, but  unreadable. But I found \\"Nightlight\\" incisive as well as evocative. \\"My son  the fanatic\\" and \\"D'accord, baby\\" are also splendid social comedies (not  really so far from Austen, except in graphicness and being set in a  multiracial England). The title story  seems to me a London version of  \\"True West\\" (without ties of blood). And \\"With your tongue stuck down my  throat\\" is hilarious.	2000-06-11

Besides seeming to have read everything written by or about  male homosexuality in Brazil (his book's apparatus occupies more than a  hundred pages), including archived forensic and psychiatric case records,  Green draws on seventy life history interviews and a cache of illustrations  from across the twentieth century.<br /><br /> Green shows that the gap  between representation of rigid (masculine-active) bofe and  (feminine-passive and frequently transvestite) bicha roles and how  Brazilian males lived their sexualities increased during 1960s, and  subsequently has been challenged in public discourse, but that behavior and  purportedly universal norms were already noncongruent during the 1930s.  Besides cataloging a history of growing bicha pride and steady bofe bashful  ambivalence, Green also shows that bicha prominence in carnival is a  tradition that is relatively recent, emerging during the 1950s, and  suppressed for a few years at the beginning of the 1970s.<br /><br />  Green  sensibly stresses the emergence during the 1950s and 60s of first bicha and  then gay publications. The American homophile movement then also involved  only a few determined individuals and fugitive publications.  Rio's famed  beaches have been important as places where men of varying economic status  who are sexually interested in men meet - and socialize, and develop group  consciousness, as well as engineering sexual liaisons. Brazilian gay clubs,  bars, and restaurants cluster near beaches with gay enclaves.	2000-05-30

The reader wants the right pair to couple (I'm not convinced the couple in _Innocence_ is the right pair; in many other Fitzgerald novels there is no  right pair, and the one here is open to question). The irony and syntax  seem  Austenian, though the epistemological status of atomic physics is not  directly addressed in anything by Jane Austen. Certainly, there are  unaffluent clergymen aplenty in Austen, and damsels who don't recognize the  match the reader recognizes. In Austen there are also plenty of unmarried  males who are also slow to recognize their appropriate partner. Daisy is  not socially appropriate (if they wed, he'll be marrying down), but Fred  Fairly is certain he must have her.<br /><br /> There is a plot, including a  court case (also a ghost story), so The Gate of Angels is more like _The  Bookshop_ than the other three late Fitzgerald novels (the four not  seemingly based to some extent on her experience of particular times and  places). Fitzgerald had a phenomenal gift for sketching characters. She was  able to develop characters more fully than she did any in  The Gate of  Angels. I'd like to know how Fred's sisters got on, for instance. Or  something of the \\"private life\\" of  Professor Flowerdew. Sometimes less is  not more! Even for someone who was a genius of concision.	2000-05-29

There is disappointingly little information about the Dulong/Drung people,  and it is very easy to question the ethics of how two Western men bent on  being the first Westerners to get into the Drung Valley treated  people--especially Tibetans whose hospitality they could be viewed as  exploiting, but even petty Chinese bureaucrats. Brackenbury is  self-critical and seems to come to realize the indefensible aspects of his  conduct. At the same time, he clearly endeavored to ease suffering through  his medical and chiropractic skills and to minimize the negative impact on  those he encountered. His indisputable physical courage is complemented by  the courage to present material that is used by some amazon reviewers to  indict him.<br /><br /> Although the book is mostly about him and what he put  himself through on a very difficult trek, I think that it provides insight  into the brittle relations between the indigenous leaders (who generally  accepted, aided, and even defended him) and the colonial Chinese officials  who do not learn the language and are the active agents of ethnocide.  Battling provincial bureaucrats is a major part of the travel literature  genre, and Brackenbury seems to me to be fair in showing some virtues as  well as vices of the Chinese officials.	2000-05-21

It is the first of those (7) that I've read that I didn't finish in a day. As usual, it is character-driven with a rich assortment of  characters,  a precisely limned milieu (Tuscany in the mid-50s), and  several desultory plots filled with misunderstandings. The focus of this  rather Forsterian novel is not on the overconfident, tall young  Englishwoman running amok in Italy. I'm not sure there is a focus. What  clicks between the romantic leads, Chiara, an Italian countess just back  from an English convent school and Salvatore, a hypersensitive-to-perceived  slights doctor of Southern peasant origins, remains mysterious. The (not  particularly prosperous) noble family throws up no objections, though an  aunt's attempt to help the newlyweds nearly has fatal consequences. The  doctor's father was an admirer of Gramsci and brought his son, then aged  ten, to visit the dying Gramsci (for me the book's most memorable scene).	2000-05-19

Will Roscoe's work on North American berdache/\\"two spirit\\"  is far and away the most theoretically sophisticated and historically  systematic work in a burgeoning field. While many people have been pawing  at a few historical records and fantasizing a great deal, he has  systematically gone through a multilingual literature, showed how the  discourse unfolded in specific European national traditions, and sorted out  continuities and discontinuities in space and in time (both in the  discourse and in the phenomena of Native American cultural survivla,  insofar as it can be glimpsed through Christianity-distorted lenses).<br /><br /> Although Roscoe's primary focus is on historical records of  \\"berdache,\\" he has also discusses contemporary \\"gay Indians,\\" building on  his earlier book _Living the Spirit_. My only regret is that Roscoe did not  include his article \\"Was We'Wah [the Zuni \\"man-woman' he wrote an earlier  book about] a homosexual?\\" in this book. _Changing Ones_ is the single  indispensable book on the subject of gender and sexuality of Native  American gender-mixing roles.	2000-05-07

Bellow is good at portraying Jewish libertinage and the friendship between  Jewish males.<br />The bad news is that Bellow is no more able than in his  early works to create credible female characters (here, the two wives of  the narrator, one a stock narcissist, the other a stock life-saver).  Ravelstein's beloved, the &quot;Chinese prince&quot; Nickie is slightly  better realized, though he is mostly seen by Chick/Bellow as an analogue of  the Jewish American princess for whom one is glad to buy  things. The love  between Ravelstein and Nickie is beyond Bellow/Chick's imaginative grasp.  And, yes, it does matter that he/they see AIDS as divine wrath. Given that  the reader learns nothing of Ravelstein's sexual modus operandi -- and, in  particular, there is no evidence of any unsafe sex after the discovery of  HIV (well, OK, there's nothing about what Ravelstein did sexually at ANY  time!) -- why is AIDS divine punishment and the toxin that nearly kills  Chick is not? Because a wife can save a husband but a male lover can't save  a male lover? And why is smoking as soon as Ravelstein is out of intensive  care celebrated, but his homosexuality is treated as necesarrily fatal?  Perhaps the failures of empathy for  or any imaginative understanding of  Ravelstein's same-sex loves are supposed to be Chick's, part of his  smallness, but I wonder if there is any separation here between the minor  writer and the much-honored Nobelist.<br /><br /> And Ravelstein/Bloom  himself? Lotsa schtick, no real substance. An entertaining greed for  expensive things, but no sense of the ideas and values that mattered most  to Bloom.	2000-05-04

And it seemed to have more stock characters. However, it ends more convincingly (less abruptly) than some of her other  novels. Having survived wading through the acronyms, I came away feeling  that there is more substance in this novel than there seemed to be while I  was reading it. Almost by the way, it provides a compelling portrait of  life in London early in the war and insight into how the English held on as  they expected a Nazi invasion during 1940. Fitzgerald has a great gift for  making human foibles simultaneously funny and touching.	2000-03-30

The main theses of this book are ludicrous: that (1) Mead was hiding what she was doing instead of working on the proposal she had made to the National  Research Council, and (2) before leaving Samoa, having done basically no  research on that, she was hoaxed by what two Samoan girls told her.<br /><br /> It is indubitable that Mead spent less time in the field and less  time exploring adolescent storm and stress than she might have (not Freeman  gathered any more data on heredity in his later and longer residence as a  colonial officer in Samoa and since). However, her initial research  proposal (of only 452) words already announced that she was going to gather  more general ethnological data. The letters from her supervisor (Franz  Boas, the Svengali of Freeman's first booklength character assassination)  clearly show the he not only knew but encouraged her to gather data beyond  her particular problem. Mead's interim report from Samoa to the National  Research Council mentioned the general ethnology work, and her final report  to the NRC included a typescript of the book that would report that, as  well as _Coming of Age in Samoa_.<br /><br /> The case against the  &quot;hoaxing&quot; is made from Mead's Samoan fieldnotes in Martin Orans's  1996 book _Not Even Wrong_. Although it was an apprentice work done when  standards for fieldwork were considerable lower, _Coming of Age in Samoa_  is far better at reporting evidence not conforming to the author's basic  theses than either of Derek Freeman's booklength diatribes. Although her  data are more consistent with the other literature on Samoa than Freeman's,  she clearly went beyond her data. There is less excuse 3/4ths of a century  later for Freeman's misuse of evidence. After nearly half a century of  concern with Samoa, the elderly (if not mature!) Professor Freeman is far  more tendentious about using evidence, and has to the best of my knowledge  not accepting a single corrective of the hundreds other anthropologists  have made of his (mis)representations of American anthropology and of Samoa  in the 1920s. His practice is the antithesis of the openness to correction  he supposedly endorses, and his books are models of how not to do  historical research.<br /><br />They also draw surprisingly little in his  supposedly extensive fieldwork in Samoa. His intention has been to  &quot;refute&quot; and slander Mead (and American anthropologists  generally), and in his monomania, he has missed opportunities to tell us  what he observed in Samoa and to develop a model of Samoan culture (or  behavior--Freeman frequently seems not to be able to distinguish  presescriptive norms from statistical behavioral norms). As a history of  anthropology, Margaret Mead, or Samoa, this book deserves no stars.more tendentious about using evidence, and has to the best of my knowledge  not accepting a single corrective of the hundreds other anthropologists  have made of his (mis)representations of American anthropology and of Samoa  in the 1920s.

Moreover, Goodwin veers across centuries as if  writing about a changeless essence (&quot;oriental despotism,&quot;  perhaps?). The least one could expect from so ahistoric or antihistoric a  would-be popularizer is clear prose.

Fitzgerald's novels are character-driven far more than they are plot-driven, OK? In this, they are like the monuments of modernism (Remembrances of Things Past, novels by  Gide, Broch, Joyce, Mann, Musil et  al.) except Fitzgerald reveals character with preternatural economy. She  has a positive genius for the detail(s) that reveals character, and her  novels have a considerable range of characters in them, including saints,  villains, wizened prepubescent girls, and all manner of muddled adults  trying to find or hold onto love, to make a living and make their world  less unkind.<br /><br /> Still, _The Bookshop_ seems to me to have a  completely clear plot and some clear subplots. I am puzzled by reader  comments about lack of plot in this nove. I suspect that at least some of  these comments confuse lack of plot with an ending that makes them  unhappy._The Bookshop_ IS a devastating book (one misunderstanding in  particular made me ache) and it is obvious that unhappy endings make a book  unpalatable to some readers. But, surely, not liking how a plot turns out  is not a valid reason to claim there is a lack of plot?<br /><br /> On the way  to catastrophe, _The Bookshop_ contains much that is also devastatingly  funny. And, although I have never lived in Sussex, I grew up in a small  town and am ready fervently to testify for the versimilitude of  Fitzgerald's portrayal of the small-mindedness, officiousnes, and  obliviousness of some of the characters (not that such qualities are  lacking in urbanites--one can find these same qualities in, say, _House of  Mirth_ as well as in _Main Street_ to take two American examples).	2000-02-13

Pham is  obviously very resilient, both physically and emotionally and makes  something of great value from painful personal history and difficult  travel.<br /><br /> Although the book is unlikely to encourage visitors  (especially Vietnamese American ones) to Vietnam, Pham's journey into the  multiple traumas of his family's experience yields insights of universal  significance. This beautifully written and painfully self-revealing book  deservedly won the 1999 Kiriyama Prize. It is hard to imagine a reader who  would not learn from the book and I would not want to meet anyone who is  not moved by its emotional force!	1999-12-15

The first book to attempt to survey homosexualities across (sub-Saharan) Africa is also a very good one. At a time when certain East African leaders  are trying to hold onto power by scapegoating homosexuality as  &quot;un-African,&quot; Murray and Roscoe show that there are and have been  a wide range of roles in &quot;traditional&quot; African cultures for those  who love persons of their own sex. Once this is established - and it is  established beyond any reasonable doubt - most readers will probably be  more interested in the parts of the book dealing with contemporary  individuals (including a young Kikuyu's male's memoir, Amory's chapter on  the changing conceptions on the Swahili coast, and an explanation of the  view in Lesotho and elsewherre that two women cannot have &quot;sex,&quot;  so that their physical relations are not seen as &quot;sexual&quot;).<br /><br /> The book concludes by looking at the &quot;social construction&quot;  of homosexualities by cross-tabulating societies with a kind of  homosexuality (with relationships structured by age, structured by gender,  or more-or-less egalitarian ones) with other structures (e.g., of  inheritance, postpartum taboos) in the same societies. No absolute,  categorical patterns emerge. I.e., there are correlations, but no clear  &quot;if x, then homosexuality y&quot; conclusions.	1999-11-29
US	52946003	R1HVN3Y55UMXED	156474230X	832653738	The Innocent	Books	2	2	6	N	N	Well-intentioned bludgeon	Robert Taylor's first novel, The Innocent, based on his 1967 experiences with the US Army in Vietnam is a clear if rather late explanation of \\"Why the US lost in Vietnam.\\" The racial sexual politics are unsettlingly  stereotypical.<br />Perhaps there were intelligence officers sent out and  who delivered the messages inconceivable and therefore rejected to the  behind-the-lines brass. It seems all too neat and didactic, especially the  lecture from Nanh's mother on the history of the Vietnamese outwaiting  conquerors, and the steadily unfolding insight into the narrator's Texas  background, official intransigence, and Vietnamese dignity. Those who think  a less-leashed military would have won will use the homosexuality to  dismiss the argument, and most of those sympathetic to interracial  homosexual relationships probably already know why the ARVN lost despite  massive US military backup.	1999-06-09

I thought my interest in mountain-men was extinguished long ago, and even as I read and admired _The Big Sky_, I maintained a large  psychological distance. However, it has continued to percolate in my memory  and I now see how well it applies to later rapers of the West who see  themselves as its lovers. The book is a formidable achievment with  resonances beyond the vivid, tragic characters.	1999-05-09

There is plenty of self-deprecating humor in it, some of it quite broad, but there is also searing criticism of corruption (exporting looted antiquities and importing  heroin, both tied to the Nepali royal family) and the corruption of  production of images of gods, goddesses, and Buddhas for the tourist  market. Some of the humor is very mordant. I happened to be reading this  book in another tourist-overrun part of Southeast Asia where there are many  shoddy Buddhas for sale, and just after reading Mark Twain's _Roughing It_.  _Shopping for Buddhas_ seemed to me more reliable and every bit as funny as  Mark Twain's tale of going and staying in the American West and getting  halfway to Kathmandu (Hawai'i).	1999-01-18

Like _Iron &amp; Silk_ and _The Laughing Sutra_, _The Soloist_  is at once very perceptive about diverse matters, very funny, and more than  a little poignant. Salzman has the compassion of a bodhisattva and the  seemingly effortless singing tone of Rostropovich. And the courage to  undertake what would seem the impossible task of combining a trial  narrative with an account of a succession of artistic mentorings.	1999-01-17
US	52946003	R155JYF0NX76M0	0395837049	237872579	Arkansas: Three Novellas	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good writing and some great game-playing	The first novella, &quot;The term paper ARTIST,&quot; is a daring  work--literally daring the reader to take the exchanges as memory rather  than fiction, and asking him/her to think about how they may differ from  the fiction built on Stephen Spender's memoir. There is no graphic sex.  There is a lot of desperate desire (not all of it the characters named or  based on David Leavitt, either) in all three novellas.<br />The  uncomprehending female narrator (Lizzie) of &quot;The wooden  anniversary&quot; is not always plausible, but is a good vehicle for  exculpating the heedlessness or sadism of Nathan, a recurrent stand-in for  David Leavitt in my reading.Good local (Tuscan) color and haunting portrait  of English speakers' adjustment to living in Italy and the havoc old ties  can introduce (yes, very Forsterian, not least in longing for an attractive  and very self-confident Italian stud).<br />I'm not sure what the point of the  last novella is. It seems good reportage of the AIDS service industry, but  can't compare to Mars-Jones's _Waters of Thirst_.	1998-10-22

Moreover, the killings aren't all at the  beginning (many mysteries only have one that occurs early, why would this  be a problem if it were so?) Although this is a historical novel (set in  1963) it portrays the \\"always outgunned\\" milieu of someone  automatically suspect because of his skin color in specific, convincing  detail (i.e., there is no chasm between Easy's world and Socrates's in  _Always Outunumbered, Always Outgunned_. For me, the most interesting  character in the Easy Rawlins series is his psychopathic friend Mouse, who  tries to leave killing behind in this book.

I find the voice and interests of the  narrator (Oe's daughter) implausible. The device does allow  self-flagellation for the as-ever guilt-ridden author, and another angle  for celebrating (sentimentalizing) his handicapped but musically gifted  son, Haraki.	1998-09-26

The illustrations are  plentiful and may be interpreted in many ways--so many and with so little  evidence that any Romans saw any of the ways Clarke does that the reader is  left to choose with no real guidance from the author.

He has a lot of (relentlessly heterosexual) libido. But, unlike Private Schweik, he's so good at what he does that he is awarded a medal by Haile Selassie (the book should be entitled I Served the Lion of Judah; it is his mentor who served the kind of England). He also attains his goal of becoming rich and enjoys the money he accumulates (for a while; eventually he decides that he has blood money and escapes its curse to become a hermit road-keeper (Sisyphus?) in the forest, cured of what approaches worship of rank, not just enjoyment of the pleasures he learns very early on that money can buy). Like _The Tin Drum_, this richly comic novel provides a take on very difficult times and sinister compatriates. The unbitter sense of absurdity (unlike Gass's more withering retrospects and Hasek's scorchings) seems shared with Kl&iacute;ma, Kundera, Skvorecky, and even Kafka. The sense of irony seems distinctively Czech in accepting some existential guilt for collusion with tyrannys. It seems to me that all these Czech authors provide very concrete images of everyday life, even-or especially-when that life is being turned upside down.	1998-07-26

More than the very explicit sex, what is likely to shock is the portrait of a Filipino American's eroticization of white men and prejudices against non-white men. The main character works through some stuff about self-image and racial domination, though he doesn't know that what he's doing. There are also some fantastic developments in the islands of his ancestors.  END	1998-06-03

Proust, rather than his immense novel (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is de Botton's preference over the usual English title &quot;Remembrances of Things Past&quot;--he does not comment on whether &quot;The Sweet Cheat Gone&quot; is an improvement upon &quot;Albertine disparue&quot;) is generally the exemplar. I.e., the books is about what can be learned from the suffering author more than from the suffering narrator of his masterpiece. As filled with delights and profound lessons as the book is, I felt that De Botton evaded THE major question about transforming Proust's experiences of frustration in loving males into the narrator's experience of frustration in loving females. Because it is Proust rather than the fictional Marcel who is central, this is all the more crucial. Did the climate of repression of the time prevent Proust from writing from an openly homosexual perspective about life and love? De Botton is eager to accept Marcel's  heterosexualization, even supplying a picture of his girlfriend (to prevent anyone thinking that so deep an immersion into the life and writings of a homosexual indicates the author is also one?). This is not merely a matter of identity politics. The possibilities of sex on a first meeting, to take one instance of what De Botton discusses, are (and were a century ago in France) different for male partners than for female ones. Still, De Botton's book is brilliant with many insights that are not compromised by not problematizing Marcel's heterosexual liaisons. I can't imagine a reader of Proust not finding passages to nod &quot;Yes, exactly&quot; and sections that will make her/him laugh aloud.	1998-05-21

People around me were curious about what was making me laugh out loud. It is very over the top, not least in grotesque violence worthy of Itchy and Scratchy. Still, the motivations (headed by cupidity) are recognizably human, and I can attest that the unconcern about the basic ecology of South Florida is accurately portrayed. Some Edward Abbey and Philip Roth mixed with Elmore Leonard? The realities of South Florida corruption and &quot;development&quot; are so absurd that satirizing them is difficult, but Hiaasen manages.	1998-04-26

A minimum editorial labor could have pruned the explanations that are unnecessary when the stories are compiled. The reader across the bay from me was too harsh with ALWAYS PREDICTABLE, ALWAYS MANIPULATIVE-- it's OFTEN PREDICTABLE, OFTEN MANIPULATIVE. Mosley (seemingly effortlessly) creates believable characters and believable, interesting plots, and shows something of how difficult it is for ghetto dwellers to get and hold jobs and survive amidst racism and both black and white male violence.	1998-03-17

I loved I SERVED THE KING OF ENGLAND and found the repetitions in it rhetorically effective, but found TOO LOUD not just boring but very irritating. I recognize that it is supposed to be an allegory about the fragility of culture (though I am not sure whether it is modernity or the communist regime that first jumbles and then pulps everything). Short as it is, the book seems incredibly padded (a mildly amusing ten-page allegory is elephantine at 98!).	1998-03-17

A little editing should have pared some passages that contribute nothing, should have established a time perspective (either remembered or ongoing), and might have encouraged a more satisfying ending. Still, the stories of these three intersecting lives are vivid and haunting and this first novel is a major achievment.	1998-03-17

How can a first novel that is structurally so accomplished get 1's and 2's? If there is stereotyping, it seems to me that it's in the white female characters, the understanding Lucy and the carnivorous Jane (who should have been inspired to go to Japan by &quot;In the realm of the senses&quot;!). The American sprawl (emotional and other) contrasted to Japanese containment is particularized, not stereotyped.

Fellows provides succinct analysis of the changing economics of agriculture in the region (increasing industrialization of larger and more capital-intensive farms)--changes which few of his interviewees seem to be aware, though some of their natal families have been squeezed out of business and off the land. Fellows arranges the accounts by the year of birth (from 1909 to 1967), and, over the book's span of time, there seems to be a decrease of the amount of dependence on the unpaid labor of children (i.e., the hours of \\"chores\\" seem to have lessened).  In addition to eliciting revealing accounts from reticent natives of the rural Midwest, Fellows gathered and reproduces photos of many of his subjects, including some who chose to use pseudonyms. Fellows's analyses of the effects of ethnicity (Germanic in contrast to Yankee), industrialization, and other social changes are astute; as are his conclusions about the costs of heterosexism. The accounts he elicited are often moving and are invariably informative about the life experiences and life worlds of heretofore invisible gay men.	1998-01-08

There is plenty of black comedy along with something close to despair about the culture of violence in Colombia. The range of family members is considerable--as full as the oeuvre of Garc&iacute;a Marquez, the most famous of Colombian writers.
