Lucas is another character who has solidified from Dime Store Magic, where he at times seemed almost two dimensional. <br /> <br />There's a serial killer attacking Cabal children and Lucas and Paige get drawn in and Lucas must face his estranged family and Paige has to deal with who Lucas comes with. The characters from the other three books make an appearance (although certainly I could always stand to see more Clay) and the new ones are interesting.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Industrial Magic. I am glad that Paige is no longer a petulant doormat and I'm going to be very interested to see how her relationships with Lucas and Savannah develop over time as well as her plans to create her E-Coven. <br /> <br />I want to hear more about the Cabals, I want to hear more about Savannah and I want more wolves (let's hear Jeremy's story please please please!). I'm eagerly awaiting Haunted.	2004-12-30

Who wants to read books that are all the same anyway? <br /> <br />Betsey is back and this time, she gets a job. Of course Sinclair thinks it's beneath her to work but she wants to earn her living (no pun intended) instead of being a kept vampire. <br /> <br />This book's baddies are killing other vamps and as the queen, it's Betsey's job to find the killer and dispatch them. <br /> <br />UU is still as funny at MJD's other vamp books (and her hilarious short story in the How to be a Wicked Woman anthology). Yes, there isn't as much focus on the romance element but what is there is good stuff. MJD brings back Tina and Jessica and Marc as well as Sinclair and adds the goofy but earnest street punk vamp slayers and a ghost.  Oh, and her father and the Ant. <br /> <br />Betsey is just as shallow and annoying as she was in Undead and Unmarried, only there's still something inherently likeable about her. This time we get to read her make fun of a pimply group of vampire slayers too as a bonus. <br /> <br />A little bit of sex, more sexual tension, some action, lots of laughs, UU is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon, especially if you need a few laughs.	2004-12-03

I read this book and had to page back over and over to try and figure out what was going on.  I never could. <br /> <br />Everyone is miserable and keeping secrets but you really can't see why and it seems very last minute.  Characters are doing things totally OUT of character. <br /> <br />There are so many thoughts and side conversations and memories that you can't even wade through them all to figure out why you even need to know all of the information Cornwell is giving you. <br /> <br />Worst of all, you slog through to the end and it's so abrupt that you get no answers to the big questions in the book.  It was like a cheap come on to read the next in the series and Cornwell's writing is better than that. <br /> <br />The book has no real focus at all and that's frustrating because, well, it's a mystery and one expects that if one reads through, there will be some answers.  When I finished, it felt like the way I did at the end of David Lynch's Lost Highway (not quite as confusing, I'll give that to Cornwell).   <br /> <br />It's a shame, I do love the series up until this point and I'm hoping Trace gets the series back on track.  It wasn't an utter waste of time, it wasn't awful, it just didn't meet any of my expectations of a Cornwell book.	2004-11-12

I was expecting something else but I was pleased with what I actually got.   <br /> <br />Instead of a larger statement about theocracy and facism, this is a more personalized view of life in Iran, about life as a woman.  <br /> <br />I didn't see the prose as dull or cliched, in fact, I thought that some passages were incredibly beautiful and evocative - where each woman comes into Azi's apartment the first time and peels off the dull black or blue robes to reveal the colorful beautiful individual beneath, for instance. <br /> <br />I thought that the book discussions were interesting and made me want to go back and re-read them again for myself with a new lens and I liked the women. <br /> <br />My only real criticism was the way the book tended to wander around.  You'd be going in one direction and suddenly take a turn and never get back to the place where you were before and had found so interesting.  It did get hard to follow in places because of that. <br /> <br />Other than that, I found Reading Lolita in Tehran to be an amazing book that filled my head with some incredible images.  Not so bad at the end of the day.	2004-11-12

I don't necessarily need a HEA, especially in erotica but this wasn't erotica either.   <br /> <br />Whether it's erotic romance, erotica or whatever, I need to be able to like the main character and Nora was likeable for a while but by the end her change of personality was neither likeable nor believable.   <br /> <br />The sex was all right, some of it was downright hot, the premise of the story and the idea of the Channel was interesting enough although I liked it in Videodrome better.   <br /> <br />All in all, I walked away annoyed and not convinced of much, I thought the dialog was stilted in many places and the character development was weak.  I have liked some of Small's other works but this one really wasn't one of them.	2004-10-25

I've enjoyed Angela Knight's ebooks and knew I'd be getting an entertaining and very sexy read with Jane's Warlord.  What I got exceeded my expectations.    Jane's Warlord is a great mix of science fiction and contemporary erotic romance.  Jane is a smart, strong and brave heroine.  Baran is much more than the typical caveman alpha male, he's got a brain and isn't threatened by Jane's intelligence or strength.      The book is also filled with several very very hot sex scenes that will melt your bones.  Knight does know how to write sexual tension like a pro.      Jane's Warlord is more than just a series of sex scenes, it has a great plot and a lot of humor and action to add to the chemistry.  It's an excellent read.    Edited to add - HELLO people!  It says \\"erotic romance\\" in the description so it seems patently unfair to rate the book low because it has the graphic sexual situations common to erotic romance.  It's like rating a sci fi book low because it's about outer space or aliens.	2004-10-25

No, it was the disjointed feel the book had overall. <br /> <br />There was a lot of great stuff in there, but the problem was that most of it fell to the wayside.  There was at least three books' worth of material there.  What about the Dragon?  Why didn't we hear more?  What about Moroven?  Why didn't we hear more?  What about the lack of blood oaths?  What about Requiem and his strange words of advice?  Why was Gregory and Stephen's dad hanging out at Guilty Pleasures?  All of these story threads were interesting but none of them were explored in the depth they deserved. <br /> <br />I don't mind Anita sleeping with more people, that isn't a problem for me.  But if we are going to be introduced to a new threesome, why have Damian disappear after the first encounter, only to be referred to as he's dying or draining Anita?  Where was our beloved Asher?  <br /> <br />Speaking of that, where were the characters that set up the core of the story arc?  No Asher, no Damian after the delicious first chapters, no Dolph except for one strained confrontation, no Sylvie or Shang Da, no Edward.  What of the vampires who remained at the end of Cerulean Sins?  Moreover, what about the end of Ceruluean Sins, there was a heck of a lot of stuff going on that never even gets referred to. <br /> <br />On a positive note, we had some resolution with Richard and thank god he's not such a royal bas*ard this book.  Nathaniel is really shaping up into a great character.  I am glad to see Anita letting go a bit and dealing with her situation with something other than anger. <br /> <br />Overall, I wasn't disappointed in Incubus Dreams, it isn't that the book is bad, it's just that it jumps from storyline to storyline without wrapping anything up.  Hamilton is a good writer, her characters are clearly ones that have the ability to catch people and make them into fans, it's not that she ran out of material, more like she had so much that she couldn't bear to edit it out. <br /> <br />	2004-10-03

Don't get me wrong, I love Katie Macalister's contemporaries but she's a breath of fresh air with her historicals.  It's so nice to read a historical with such a great sense of humor and such strong and fiesty female leads. <br /> <br />Harry needs a wife.  He's got five out of control children and is in desperate need of a woman to run his household and, er, attend to his needs.  Enter Plum, a woman who's been ruined by her first husband over 20 years before.  She's also the mysterious author of a very racy sex book.  Both the romantic leads are over 40, something that pleased me compared to books with 19 year old women married to 35 year old men.   <br /> <br />Of course, this being a Macalister book, silly hijinks ensue, the kids are wild, the household staff are a wild assortment from the lothario butler to the bodyguard footmen and Harry and Plum engage in all manner of bedroom gymnastics with great energy and creativity.  Plum is no pushover and even when it becomes obvious that someone is out to harm her new family, she does not waver.  You gotta love the heroine who doesn't wilt at the first difficulty.  You also have to love Harry for loving Plum so much.   <br /> <br />All in all, The Trouble with Harry is an amazingly entertaining read that will supply plenty of laughs and more than a little heat between Plum and Harry.	2004-09-24

I didn't see Simon as a neanderthal or as being into dominance sexually at all.   <br /> <br />In fact, I saw Simon as one of those people who has opened himself up a few times to other people and has been kicked in the teeth because of it.  He's lonely and lost and needs love but he can't bear to get hurt or lose another person.  He takes pictures because you can watch life through the lens but you don't have to live it that way. <br /> <br />Ellen is a woman who has loved this wounded man for most of her life.  Yes, he walked out 17 years before and she's always held him in the back of her mind but she gets him in a way that others don't.   <br /> <br />So it seems to me, utterly natural that they'd both be fumbling around, messing things up over it.  Simon in his defensive mode and Ellen, feeling frustrated at that defense but understanding it all the same. <br /> <br />I liked the tension between Ellen and Simon better than that between Connor and Erin in Standing in the Shadows and the story caught me much quicker than SIS did.  In fact, Ellen is much less a damsel in distress than Erin was and I liked her more although there was a point at which I wish she'd told her future mother in law to shut up.   <br /> <br />One thing that did puzzle me was the 180 degree change in some of the characters like Brad.  He starts off a jerk but ends up a hurt boy who fights to get his real love back, I couldn't really find the logical place where that happened.   <br /> <br />Overall though, Return to Me appealed to me more than Standing in the Shadows but I've loved all three of McKenna's full length books as well as the short stories she's done.  All hail the misunderstood bad boy.	2004-09-12

I've been trying to get a copy of Top of Her Game for two years now and so I was happy to see that Cheek was doing a reissue of several of Emma Holly's more popular but out of print titles from Black Lace. <br /> <br />Top of Her Game, like Personal Assets and Menage, is definitely a keeper.  Holly most certainly knows how to create hot tension between her lead characters and she does it in this book quite well.   <br /> <br />Julia, despite being at loose ends in her life is fascinated and compelled by Zach, the owner of the Montana dude ranch she's sent off to for the weekend.  She's also got some major baggage that comes from a childhood experience of seeing her mother disciplining her lover.   <br /> <br />The sex, and there's plenty of it here, is varied, there's certainly something for everyone.  If you are faint of heart, this probably isn't the book for you.  Then again, complaining that there's too much sex in an \\"erotic\\" romance seems to be counterintuitive. <br /> <br />The book is vintage Holly, great scorching sex scenes, hot men and women to choose from, smart independent women and endings that are happy but where the woman is living on her own terms.  I most definitely recommend Top of Her Game and urge you to get out there and buy the reissue before this one goes out of print too! <br />  <br />P.S. -My only complaint is the cover.  What an ugly and totally misleading cover it is!  The main character is a dominatrix, she has sex with multiple partners at a dude ranch in Montana, the cover has a cartoon woman in a sweater with a funny looking blonde bob.  What's up with that?  Aside from making the book look like chick lit, which it is most definitely (and thankfully) not, it's misleading to the extreme.  I know that covers like this make the book more acceptable to buy and read in public but at the same time, they are silly.  I'd like to think that as adult women, we can be trusted with a cover that isn't silly.	2004-08-31

As far as literary couples go, they are up there near the top and even after 19 books, they've still got it.  BUT... you didn't see enough of the interaction between them that makes them so special in Visions in Death. <br /> <br />There's a serial killer on the loose, Eve is on the case, works herself to exhaustion, and, in contrast to her past behavior, begins to open up to her friends about her horrible childhood abuse.  I know some get tired of Eve's abuse storyline but frankly, it would be far worse if Robb simply had Eve get over something so terribly traumatic.  I like that she's slowly working through it. <br /> <br />The mystery was good, Robb adds a psychic to the mix for something new.  Not enough Feeney and McNab for me but the storyline was good and kept me interested.  There was a great twist at the end that I really didn't see coming, which was nice. <br /> <br />Overall, another enjoyable addition to the series but I did miss all of the elements that make Eve so interesting, her interaction with the people in her life.  We got only brief glimpses of them this time around and I hope that we'll get more in the next installment.	2004-08-27

One, I'm not a fan of so called chick lit and two, I had read Under Cover, which I liked but wasn't inspired to pick up more by Davidson.  Well, I'm glad that I finally gave into the pressure of the great word of mouth and overcame my biases and picked this book up!   <br /> <br />Undead and Unwed is a wickedly fun read.  Not just because it's funny, clever and well written, but because it takes several genres and turns them on their ear.  Yes, it has elements of chick lit but instead of shallow and flat lead female characters, Betsey loves shoes and clothes but she's not a drone and she's likeable even though she annoyed me with her choices at times.  She's strong, funny and despite her questionable common sense, she's a heroine that you can genuinely like (something I find rare in chick lit). <br /> <br />Sinclair is dark and broody and oh so alpha male but his arrogance is endearing rather than cloying.  The other vampire cast of characters runs from stupidly stereotypical (Nostro) to Buffyish - all with humor and on purpose. <br /> <br />Undead and Unwed is a fun read.  It's witty and amusing and the characters aren't grating.  I'll definitely be grabbing the next in line, Undead and Unemployed.	2004-08-26

I was less than thrilled with Tale of Two Vikings but The Cajun Cowboy had me laughing from page one. <br /> <br />Charmaine, the fluffy hairdresser you meet in the other two Cajun books is back with her own story.  I can't say that I was overly interested in her character but Hill really paints a three dimensional woman who is constantly misjudged because of what she appears to be on the outside. <br /> <br />In walks Rusty, her ex husband and the bane of her libido. She tries to avoid him but it's impossible and bam, the ex in husband isn't so ex anymore when she finds that they aren't really divorced. <br /> <br />Hijinks ensue.  She hides out from loan sharks at the dilapidated ranch they both own half of.  Secrets surface, the two of them have a lot to work through.  Loads of scorching chemistry between them erupts into great interludes, including one at a hourly motel that's also funny in addition to being sexy. <br /> <br />Tante Lulu is back with her St. Jude statues and hope chests, along with the LeDeux boys.  You meet Charmaine's stripper mother and her airstream trailer and personal trainer as well. <br /> <br />The Cajun Cowboy is a great follow up to Tall Dark and Cajun and I'm eagerly awaiting Rene's story next!!	2004-08-14

Of course, her boss wants her to quit and all is fine until the best runner also quits with her and suddenly she's got assasins coming out of the woodwork trying to end her life. <br /> <br />You've got a pixie/faerie turf war, were assasins, vampire dating etiquitte, loads of fight scenes, including rat fights, and magical interaction.  A bit of something for everyone.  The bad guys are really bad and nearly invincible, there are no easy battles for Rachel to face and she gets her butt kicked quite a bit.  It's nice to have a strong female warrior character who isn't either totally addled or perfect.  She's someone you can admire but also identify with. <br /> <br />Great backstory, great metastructure, interesting characters, three dimensional interaction, dialog and action.  Harrison has created a great new alternate universe that you want to read more about.   <br /> <br />She left plenty of loose ends to pick up in the next installment and I know I'll be waiting anxiously to pick it up.  One thing though, the cover is a bit misleading, this book really isn't about vampires although there are vampires in it. It's more complex than that but I didn't walk away disappointed.	2004-08-05

Thank goodness! No, she's 28, a spinster and has never received a single proposal. <br />  <br /> Colin Bridgerton is a handsome rogue and he knows it. He's charming and the ladies love him but he feels at a loose end. His brothers have purpose in life but he feels that he's got nothing. His return to England after so much travel has left him wanting something but not knowing what.  <br />  <br /> Of course, if you've read the other books in the series you know that Penelope has been in love with Colin since she was 16 and that he likes her but has always felt sorry for her. This all changes when he begins to see that there's more to Penelope than meets the eye. <br />  <br /> That's really what made me like this book so much, that the female lead isn't a blushing virgin, she's smart and witty and the handsome rakish male isn't some dominating force. I like their chemistry.	2004-08-02

She finds something as B, responds to her question during a speech about where the male muses are.  But B is much more than just her muse, he becomes her lover and her financial support at the same time.<br />Some really important questions are asked as we move through the book.  For me, her attempts to rise above the fact that she was having sex with B and he was giving her money for her art and whether that made her a whore was one I gave a lot of thought to.  Moreover, I think some really interesting takes on modern day feminism were explored.<br />The thing that made this book so compelling for me was that Monica is not a likeable character in the least.  She's a horrible mother, she's selfish, she doesn't treat B very well most of the time and yet, you want to read more about her.  Very few authors can suck you in that way.<br />I didn't see this book as a romance novel.  Goodness knows I've read enough of them.  There is no ease here, no real romance.  Sex sure, but a lot of difficult exploration of personal stuff keeps it far from the harlequin romance descriptions I've seen in some other reviews.  The real difficulty of balancing one's feminist preconceptions with the reality of sharing a life with someone else, especially when they are supporting you financially brings it to a completely different level.<br />No, the book isn't perfect but it is compelling and beautifully written.  This is a rare and delicious treat.	2004-06-28

Then again, it didn't give enough about the witches and half demons to grab me completely either.  I started this book a bit wary having been so invested in the werewolves but I was pleasantly surprised by the content.<br />Paige Winterbourne is 23, she's lost her mother and is the guardian of 13 year old Savannah, who we meet in Stolen.  Savannah is the daughter of a good witch gone bad and as it turns out, her father is a sorceror and next in line for leadership of a very powerful Cabal.<br />The Cabal, aided by the wicked Leah (who we also met and grew to loathe in Stolen), decides they want Savannah and sets out to sabotage Paige's life to get her.  <br />Paige has to face a whole lot of stuff at once in this book.  I hate weak women characters and so when I read a few reviewers complaining that Paige was weak, I had to see for myself.  I totally disagree that she is weak.  First of all, she's 23 years old and has just lost her mother and is trying to raise a 13 year old who is more powerful than she is.  The Coven that she is the leader of doesn't respect her authority, she wants to change things for the better but is stopped at every turn.  Then these sorcerors come in and frame her for a whole host of things.  Her once solid life has turned totally upside down, everyone wants her to give the child up but if she does, the child will go evil and she also promised her mother to take care of her.  So despite her fears, despite the fact that she faces losing everything she's ever thought was important, she holds to her promises and fights.  That's not weak, that's incredibly brave. She's not a demon slayer, she's not a superhero, she's a witch and not an incredibly powerful one at that but she keeps on fighting.<br />I won't do any specific spoilers but we meet some new characters with potential to be the mainstay of the next book, Lucas Cortezbeing the main one, another rebel against the strict class based system of their supernatural world.<br />The book is well written, the characters are nicely fleshed out and have interesting interactions with each other.  The story is definitely unfolding into something much larger and I will be anxiously awaiting Industrial Magic when it comes out this fall.	2004-06-26

Sadly, I had it read in a little over two hours and put it down feeling very unsatisfied.  <br />First of all, the book seems rushed.  She builds up well and then loses it by wrapping everything up so quickly and neatly.  This seems to be a trend with authors of series that start out paperback and then move to hardback and end up rushing and leaving everyone dissatisfied with the layout of cash for the HB that seems hurried along.<br />The book is hilarious though.  The scene with the mad (...) dogs had me laughing so hard tears ran down my face.  There's the usual insanity of the Plum family and the happy return of Sally Sweet who is now a school bus driver moonlighting as a cross dressing rock star.  Grandma Mazur is her usual self and mom is drinking a heck of a lot of whiskey.  Albert chokes and valerie gets cold feet, Morelli is sexy but insistent that Stephanie quit and Ranger is, as always, dark, dangerous and very very hot.<br />The mystery was good but again, I felt that it had good build up and ended up getting rushed.  Where most books have at least a hundred pages that are superflous, this book needed at least another hundred pages.<br />Uh and Stephanie is in Ranger's bed in a tee shirt and (...)and we only get a hastily written kiss?  The scenes between her and Morelli got a few paragraphs.  I wanted more, the usual definition she gives so that you get a great feel for what they all mean to each other - that is the heart of a Plum book and that is what's missing in Ten Big Ones.<br />Evanovich can write well, she's got a great sense of humor and the characters are all interesting and have great chemistry together, which is a rare thing.  I felt like this book had so much more potential and it got wasted.	2004-06-25
US	37113680	R153R2O8MGMPR	0758205562	531715011	Bad Boys Next Exit	Books	4	20	20	N	N	Nice to See the Turn Back to Greatness	I loved the first two anthologies (I Love Bad Boys, I Brake For Bad Boys), the third was still good but slipping and Bad Boys to Go didn't do much for me at all.  However, with Bad Boys Next Exit we see a return to the surprising and edgy tone that made me pick the first book up to begin with.<br />My favorite story of the three was Shannon McKenna's, Meltdown.  McKenna is an author I discovered through these anthologies and I haven't been disappointed with anything she's written yet.  Smart, edgy, sexy and unique, the heat between Mac and Jane is palpable and the sex scenes are amazing.  EC Sheedy, a new author discovery for me, writes the my second favorite.  Ginger is a smart successful woman with insecurities, Cal is the sexy man who sees beneath the dumpy clothes she wears to keep away men just like him.  Nice chemistry, hot love scenes.  Donna Kauffman's story was my least favorite but it was still really quite good.<br />As with most romantica books of the genre, you get characters who find and declare love quite quickly and usually end up married or engaged.  Not the most realistic scenario in the world but it is a work of fiction and a little bit of love at first sight is not a bad thing.<br />All in all, well written, great characters with sizzling chemistry.  A fabulous return to the first highly readable books in the series.  The series has brought authors like Erin McCarthy, Shannon McKenna and Janelle Denison to my attention and I'll be adding EC Sheedy as well.	2004-06-22
US	37113680	RR1CQGMXUI04W	1581822928	445378876	The Advocate	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Quick, Entertaining and Well Written	I generally find myself annoyed while reading legal books, they are either poorly researched attempts written by non lawyers who know nothing about how the legal world works or they are horrible ego strokes written by, well some of the big names out there in legal fiction and usually have dumb women who need to be saved by the super testosterone driven brilliant male attorney.<br />Thank goodness The Advocate is such a breath of fresh air.  The look into the legal world is pretty accurate although it does come from a very specific perspective (that of the defense attorney).  Despite that, I did think it provided a pretty balanced view of the foibles of both the prosecutorial mindset as well as the mindset of the defense attorney and neither is perfect to say the least.<br />Darcy Cole is a high profile Chicago defense attorney who has just won a murder case for cool as ice Lynn Tobias only to have a US Attorney with eyes on the Governor's mansion make an end run and charge her with insurance fraud with murder as a related offense.<br />Add to that the fact that a mob boss' out of control son has placed a hit on his life and a mid life crisis and you get several interesting and quirky characters and a strong main storyline with a few nice side threads to keep things moving.  <br />The legal stuff is authentic and I've pretty much seen every single one of the characters in real life.  From the no nonsense hardass judge to the grandstanding US attorney, I was impressed that the book lacked the superhero know it all attorney so common in other books.<br />The case was nicely written, enough technical stuff to satisfy picky people like me but not too much as to slow the story down.  Good twists and turns.  The end was surprising, although I'd already guessed part of it, but not a total and utter shock.<br />All in all, I really enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it to my friends in the legal community who are as tired as I am of the run of the mill legal thriller.	2004-06-19

This book didn't succeed on any of those levels.<br />The skeleton of the story was fine but it didn't go anywhere.  It wasn't that it was far fetched, it's not like we haven't seen the supposed good guys doing bad things.  It was that there were a whole lot of words but not a whole lot of substance.  I felt like I was just passing through the story, there was nothing to grab the reader.<br />Alex whined a lot (and we're supposed to believe she's this tough chick photojournalist but she whines an awful lot for a supposed tough chick), Judd brooded a lot, Logan (yes, we know he's a billionaire) ordered people around and said he'd do anything to save his wife a lot.  There was panic, running and hiding, some action and mystery but it never fell into a cohesive and compelling storyline.<br />I haven't read Johansen before, this was a impulse, the book was on the &quot;Your librarian likes&quot; shelf and I took a chance.  It wasn't awful or poorly written, it just wasn't anything one way or the other.	2004-06-11

But, when compared with Roberts' other work and the other two books in the series, it didn't hold up her normal level of quality.<br />My biggest problem is that Mia was the strongest and most compelling woman of the three from the series but her story was the least compelling of the trilogy.  That was disappointing.<br />I liked that Mia and Sam were Fire and Water and had the complimentary and yet fire and ice sort of relationship.  Thing is, I didn't find the whole idea of him leaving the way he did and yet coming back and expecting her to fall at his feet very enticing.  The way he left was cruel and I couldn't understand why she should take him back or even why we're supposed to believe he had this deep love for her.  The Sam of the present was not the Sam that left Mia, but you're supposed to think he is except for this glaring mistake.  Yes, people change but I didn't buy it.<br />So much happens in the story that you don't understand or seems to come from nowhere, big and important parts of the story seem to have been added at the last minute.  I thought the end was totally confusing and even though I read it a few times it still seemed to come out of left field.  Usually Roberts does this sort of thing exceptionally well, and she did in the other two books, but this one left me feeling unsatisfied.<br />All in all, it was interesting enough to hold my attention and it was nice to see the character progression for Nell and Ripley but it left me feeling flat.	2004-06-10

But I felt like this book had about 100 pages of stuff that was superflous.  <br />Lisa - yes she's got some likeable traits but at the same time, she's cruel and that's not likeable and it is hard to get past that.  Keyes puts in stuff that makes her sad, a scene with her shaving off chocolate with her teeth to make it last longer, her constant hunger, her envy.  And yet, I found it impossible to get past the way she treated others in the office.  Maybe it's because I've worked for people who find it hilarious to be cruel and nasty to their subordinates out of a desperate need to feel superior, but there it is.<br />Ashling - likeable, funny.  The only character in the book I could enjoy for the most part, except for the storyline about depression, which seemed contrived.  I won't give spoilers but her not dealing with a major issue was frustrating.<br />Clodagh - uh, are we ever supposed to find her likeable?  It made Ashling less likeable because a shallow woman like this was supposed to be her best friend.  I found myself wanting to smack her into reality every time she came into the book.  What an utterly unredeemable character.<br />Generally, I liked the big picture stuff.  Women struggling with their professional selves versus their personal lives.  Dealing with insecurities and self esteem problems, marriages and divorce.  I just didn't find the individual women that Keyes chose to do it with very convincing and she took an awful circuituous route to get there.	2004-06-06
US	37113680	RTRCM9Y2KA17R	0345462327	559514085	Flashpoint (Troubleshooters, Book 7)	Books	3	8	10	N	N	All of the great Suz elements were there but didn't add up	Suzanne Brockmann's books are my guilty pleasure and I have pretty much adored each one of them and the coupling she makes.  <br />In Flashpoint, we see a new series begin with Troubleshooters Inc, the new agency that Tommy Paoletti starts up with Sam and Alyssa.  <br />Generally, Brockmann creates great chemistry between the characters on a team.  You like the guys, you can see how they are dedicated to each other and at the same time, she is building new stories between the lines.  The team itself is usually an integral part of the story but that seemed to be missing here.<br />In Flashpoint you have Deck and Nash as the kernel of the team.  Yes, she does write them as best friends but somehow, it misses the mark that her other books have set.  You have some details of their relationship but both men come off a bit hollow.  The other men in their team, Murphy and Dave are not given enough page space but yet, I feel like I got a better picture of Dave than I did of Jimmy Nash who was the male lead.<br />Tess Bailey was a good female lead, strong, smart, independent and courageous and I thought she was very likeable.  What I didn't understand was why she'd continually give a guy like Nash a chance.  We get a lot of stuff that's half said in Nash's head, but not a whole lot that's actually articulated to Tess and it made me wonder how you were supposed to like a woman who would let some guy like Nash back into her heart, especially when Deck was there and a much better alternative.  Even the love scenes, which Brockmann writes like a pro, seemed to lack any real intimacy or even depth.  <br />The military op was interesting enough but I didn't feel like a whole lot of time was spent on it although I was relieved not to have a world war II story stuck in there somewhere.  <br />All in all, I wanted more of the characters I loved to wade me into this new series.  I think the feeling that the story wasn't fully fleshed out was due to the fact that we are learning a whole new set of characters for this new series and hopefully, we'll see Deck's story next (or maybe Cosmo's?) and the bumps will be smoothed out.	2004-05-19
US	37113680	RQNK2J7LAYPF5	0399151540	645136087	Divided in Death	Books	5	59	59	N	N	My favorite so far	Yes, Divided in Death is different from the other books in the series.  You have your typical Eve driven investigation of murder with someone she or Roarke knows and need to prove innocent.  You've got your people who misunderstand Eve's ways which hurts her but she remains silent.  McNab, Peabody, Mavis, Feeney and Trueheart are all there, which makes for a nice continuity.  <br />This time we've got spies and government intrigue at the heart of the murder case.  But Divided is more personal than the other books.  Eve and Roarke have always had heated arguments but have been solid with their marriage because of their love for each other.  This time, they each struggle with something inherent to their make up and it's not so easily moved past.  <br />A great part of the book, contrasted with the others, Eve and Roarke cannot find their way to each other, they are estranged by their different reactions to some information that comes to light about Eve's past.  It's this struggle which makes the heart of the book so compelling because you want them to make it, they are the other half of the other but at the same time, some things can't just be moved past.  <br />I won't give spoilers but I found this intensely personal approach a nice refreshing change from the other books and I thought Robb wrote it well and threaded it into the mystery in such a way that you don't get bored with one or the other.  <br />There were a few scenes in the book where I must admit I did get a bit weepy.  Eve, without Roarke's strength, without his love and support is very empty and sad and it reminds you of who she was in Naked In Death and how far she's come.  <br />A very worthy read for those who've followed the series and the growth of the characters and the marriage between these two unlikely lovers.	2004-05-17
US	37113680	R1Q28NLT7DIJSK	0352337192	318046264	Divine Torment (Black Lace)	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Sexy in some places but mainly falls flat	I wish that Ashbless had just written a straight story with a lot of hot sex, fleshed out the characters and the storyline and not attempted to have both erotica and this alternate universe/past history/gladiator story too because each attempt suffers.<br />I'll say up front that I really believe it's difficult to say, in a general manner, whether the sex is really hot in an erotica book.  People are turned on by different things and so it's pretty subjective on my part but hey, that's what reader reviews are for I suppose.  <br />Anyway, I thought that two or three of the sex scenes were smoking hot and written very well, nice tension, build up and well, climax.  Veraine was a pretty sexy alpha male type dude.  However, other scenes seemed to be added at the last minute, to make the story seem more like erotica.  <br />The story, a city under seige by a foreign force, the inhabitants being ruled by a woman who is the goddess incarnate (sort of like the Indic goddess Kali, a goddess of destruction and death).  Veraine (sort of like a Roman soldier) leads his men in to save the city because it provides the empire with strategic value.  That part is fine and even interesting, but there are times when the story becomes laden down with stuff that goes nowhere.  The actual invasion part is not very long and is tied up quite quickly, despite the fact that the book is leading up to it from the first pages.  <br />I thought that in an attempt to write a more drawn out book of erotica, that the story and the sex suffered and by the end, I didn't care about either one.	2004-05-17

I must admit to an initial hesitance, I read the back and was slightly interested.<br />I'm so glad that I forged ahead and picked it up to read because it's so much better than the back cover makes it out to be.  <br />Weather wardens, Earth Wardens, Fire Wardens - I wasn't overly interested by the cover and yet, Caine introduces us to these wardens who protect the rest of us from the weather and the earth and other natural disasters with a really unique and interesting spin.  That they are aided bu djinn only adds something else.<br />Joanne Baldwin is a weather warden who is on the run from a murder wrap, oh and she's bearing a demon mark too.  Knowing that the only way to get rid of the demon that's been forced into her body is to force it on another human, which is against her moral code, or a djinn, who are rare but she knows who might have a spare or two.  Jo drives all over the eastern seaboard and into the south with djinn, friends, foes and killer storms all popping in and out.<br />The results, rather than seeming scattered or disconnected, actually create a tight story and a macro universe from which many other stories can come (and I hear she's working on two more books now).  <br />The story has a few good twists that you don't see coming and lots of action and a bit of sexual tension.  All in all, a great recipe and a very readable book.	2004-05-10

She's fled that life and is trying to live as a human in Toronto, complete with a new live in boyfriend who has no idea who she truly is.  The weight of that, of being closeted begins to wear on her - she has to eat secretly, run secretly.<br />In the midst of this, her old Pack leader Jeremy, a man who has been like a father to her, calls her back home and she relents, albeit reluctantly.<br />From here, we watch as Elena struggles with her anger over who she really is and also over who she'll never be again.  Her anger and love for Clay.  Clay, having been bitten and changed as a very young child has none of the hesitancy and reluctance that Elena feels and this often causes tension between them.  (and other things but I won't give any spoilers).<br />Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, Elena is not weak minded at all.  She's incredibly strong, first just to have survived the bite and transformation and also the betrayal by the man she loved when he bit her without permission.  Secondly, she's an enforcer for her Pack, she hunts down the mutts who are rogue wolves and kills them, she's universally feared by those who operate outside of Pack structure.  The internal struggle she faces in choosing between her life at Stonehaven as a werewolf and her life in Toronto as a closeted wolf is written well and is convincing.<br />I must say the chemistry between Elena and Clay and my own personal bias against living as a closet anything had me rooting for Elena to just finally get past her anger and accept who she was and be with her Pack and Clay.  I also enjoyed her relationship with the other wolves in her Pack, namely Jeremy.<br />Bitten is a really creative new take on the werewolf novel and an excellent first novel from Armstrong.  The others in the series are good as well but this one is my personal favorite of the group.  It's sexy, funny, action filled and a really good entry in the horror/romance/paranormal genre that isn't gory, insultingly stupid or insipid in any way.	2004-05-08

I've been eagerly awaiting this newest installment in the life of Sookie Stackhouse and the other supernatural residents of Bon Temps and Shreveport Louisana and I'm so happy to say I wasn't disappointed.  From book one Harris has written with a great amount of humor and I was laughing just a few paragraphs into DTW as well.  The books definitely have a Southern flavor, which makes them unique and very readable, if over a bit too fast.<br />I don't want to give many spoilers but I have to say I was very very happy with what happened between Sookie and Eric.  As Bill was a great big butthead and cheated and nearly cost Sookie her life, I can see that she wanted to back off from him and he deserves to feel some uncertainty about her.  I liked Bill from Dead Until Dark and Living Dead in Dallas but no one likes a cheater, especially when the girlfriend is someone like Sookie.<br />I've been an Eric fan since Living Dead in Dallas and I love how Harris gives us another view, the Eric behind the ego, the stripped down version, which seems to be perhaps what he was like as a human.  <br />I love Harris' introduction of new weres and shifters into the story and unlike another reviewer, I can see how someone like Sookie, who is more than human, would be attractive to them and yeah, I think that a woman who has been essentially shunned and mistreated by the humans in  her town deserves a little desire.  It's not like she's doing anything about it with every single person who thinks she's cute.  <br />My only disappointment was that it was over so fast and I hope it won't be another year before we get the next installment so we can see what the next steps will be between Sookie and Eric and Bill.	2004-05-08

I've been waiting for Wulf's story since Night Pleasures and I am pleased to say Kenyon did him justice in the newest installment of the Dark Hunter saga.<br />Wulf is a Viking who came into being a Dark Hunter by trickery rather than voluntarily.  As such, he's different from most Dark Hunters and part of his curse is that most people, all humans except for those of his blood, cannot remember him five minutes after they meet him.  Of course this makes him incredibly lonely and overprotective of his last living relative and squire Chris.  There's some great stuff there between Wulf and Chris and I hope that we can hear more about the Squires as the books go forward.<br />In walks Cassandra, a 26 year old Appolite who will die a horrible painful death on her 27th birthday like all other cursed Appolites if she doesn't choose to become a soul sucking Daimon instead.  <br />Bingo, they meet when he saves her life (did I mention that she's the last of her bloodline and if she dies the world ends so the Spathi Demons are trying to kill her and bring on armageddon?) and she remembers him.  Hot sex dreams ensue and they fall in love (and a bunch of other stuff that would be spoilers so I'll refrain).<br />A strong leading female character is so nice to see in a romance book.  Smart, tough and yet very soft and a nice foil for the uber tough barbarian Wulf.  Great sexy chemistry makes them a good couple.<br />I enjoyed hearing more of the backstory of how the Appolites and the Daimons came into existence and as always, it's a pleasure to read anything featuring Ash.  I also enjoyed a more complete portrayal of the Appolites and Daimons, creating a more complex view, rather than Dark Hunters good and Daimons bad.  Loads of hanging story threads for future books too.<br />All in all, quite enjoyable, although I must admit to not seeing a single \\"matrix style\\" fight scene as is described in one review.	2004-04-28

He wanted, no needed to be touched all of the time.  He nursed a lot, and slept very little.  He had colic for SIX months and I think I cried along with him every day.<br />We went to the doctor but there was nothing physically wrong with him.  I felt like it was our fault,that we were doing something wrong.  Until I found this book and bought it out of sheer frustration.<br />Thank goodness for this book and for the Sears!  Finally, someone who understood what we were going through.  Finally, someone who gave solid advice and ideas for how to deal with the situation.  Not to break the baby of his behaviors, but how to deal with them, diffuse them, roll with them and help him grow.  I was able to get past the feelings of guilt and failure and be a better parent to the baby we had.<br />As time went by, he slowly grew out of the high needs behavior and now he's a happy, spirited six year old who brings us joy every day.  Fortunately, our second wasn't high needs and slept through right away but he's now a very spirited toddler, so I have used this book again, as a reference.  <br />For people who expect every word in this book to apply to them evenly, I think you'll be disappointed, that isn't what a reference book is or does.  This book will help you in many ways but not everything will be applicable to every single thing, nor is it supposed to make you feel bad if you don't do every single thing they suggest.  <br />It's a great reference for those parents who are at their wits' end in dealing with a high needs baby and I am so very glad I found it!	2004-04-25

Michael Dante is a great lead male character, he's kind, smart, centered and sexy.  Theresa, well, she's troubled because of a near rape that happened to her in Martin's previous book Body Check.  <br />I thought Martin handled the way a rape victim would react really well and that the sex wasn't until the end was a good thing. Michael's reactions to Theresa were wonderful, he was patient and kind and took things slow and respected that she'd need the time to acclimate to having a physical relationship, especially with a hockey player.<br />BUT - I'm not sure Theresa was that likeable.  She treated Michael like crap for some of Body Check and about 2/3 of this book.  It was more than her problems recovering from the violence that happened to her.  She was rude and cruel about his (and her own) heritage and yet, he joked about it.  She blew him off over and over, and yet, he was easygoing and kept pursuing her.  I wasn't sure I liked her much in Body Check but it was really hard to get past her attitudes about her old neighborhood and her ethnicity.  Yes, she gets past it at the end but it was something I found hard to swallow.<br />And the way that Michael goes off on Theresa in the locker room after an item turns up in the paper about them was just out of character for him.  Yes, he was frustrated and that was fine but his words were so cruel that it didn't fit and to blame her for being worried about how people would think about her after she was ripped apart in Body Check as some kind of puck bunny after money, her attitude made a certain amount of sense.<br />I just thought that the blow up scenes were all wrong and out of character and pretty cruel.  It made it hard to like anyone in the book.  <br />Their chemistry was nice, the storyline was humorous and serious where it needed to be and overall, I enjoyed it, but I had some major problems and it made it difficult to like the female lead at all.	2004-04-24

I first stumbled across Katie Macalister's historical novels and fell in love with her unique approach to the genre.  Her humor and three dimensional characters make her work stand out from the pack of regency romances and rightfully so.<br />Later, I found her contemporaries and saw that the same sense of humor and irreverence existed.<br />Sex and the Single Vampire is, lucky to say, as good as her other books.  The banter and sexual tension between Christian, the old school vampire who hates independent women and Allie, the former battered wife, now independent woman who hates arrogant men is lovely.  The secondary characters, be they ghosts or summoners or vampire groupies, are written just as well.  In fact, the dear abby ghost mentor Esme and her advice on love and sex is one of my favorite things about this book.<br />Yes, you have the typical tortured alpha male who is looking for his other half. Only, his other half is flawed and scared and yet she sticks it out.  The humor, the way the characters are all flawed in some way, it lends a touch of realism to the story that makes Macalister's books stand out.<br />Warm, witty, sexy and entertaining, Sex and the Single Vampire is definitely worth a read.	2004-04-12

How refreshing is that?  Even better?  The sci fi is well written, funny and isn't eclipsed by the sex.<br />Zor, the High King seeks out his mate, who just so happens to be a human from earth, Kyra Sommers.  He comes to get her, finds she's not a typical wilting willow and it goes from there.  <br />Nice backstory, thank god the female lead isn't some whining, 18 year old virgin.  <br />To those who complain about the sex being graphic - when you read \\"erotic romance\\" you're going to get a book with lots of sex in it.  If you don't like lots of sex in your books, especially graphic sex, it's pretty much general common sense to avoid the words \\"Erotic\\" in the title or description.  As to what does or doesn't ring your bell sex wise, that's all relative.  I found the sex to be pretty hot and very well written, different things work for different people, this happened to work for me.	2004-03-31

In fact, I almost didn't read this book because of that. <br />Anil's Ghost on the other hand, has some of the most beautifully written prose I've ever read.  Part One drew me in and made me ache that anyone could have such talent with the written word.<br />The book isn't told in a traditional way.  It takes energy to follow it, there are a lot of leaps the reader must make, especially toward the end, to keep track of the characters and storyline, but it wasn't impossible and given the subject matter, it wasn't a surprise either.<br />In my opinion, the non linear way the story was told made it more like storytelling than a book and as such, I thought it a very clever way to approach the subject matter.  Death squads are never easy to deal with, government sponsored murders, rebels kidnapping doctors, criminal shortages of medical supplies - these things are horrifying, so horrifying the first impulse is to look away.  Instead Ondaatje tells us the story of loss and hopelessness through the lives of the characters, which enables us to hear it.  <br />Humans are fallable, that people stand by and say nothing while great atrocities take place is not only cowardly, it's human nature.  I think that to make the characters in this book three dimensional and real, Ondaatje crafted them with flaws.  Anil's inability to connect, Sarath's government connections, Gamini's distaste for people in general - these are all ways of drawing the reader in.  The goal isn't to make us like Anil or Sarath, it's to tell the story through them, through different perspectives.	2004-03-23
US	37113680	RS0IBDAPAEJJK	0345453417	554884676	Cry No More	Books	4	3	3	N	N	One of My Favorite Howard Books	The book opens with a heartstopping account of a woman's infant literally being ripped from her by kidnappers in a market in Mexico.  She fights the men with desperation and ends up nearly dying from a stab wound and loses her baby.<br />We then move ten years ahead.  Milla has lost her marriage to her devotion to finding her child.  She has little more in  her life than the organization she's founded to locate missing persons. She is estranged from family who tell her to give up and get on with her life.<br />Milla is tireless in her fight to find Justin and while she's had nothing but dead ends and heartache in her own struggle, she's managed to find other people's children and family members so often she's become something of a national celebrity for it.<br />There are interesting turns here and there.  The one eyed man she's looking for in connection with the ring of kidnappers to find infants in Mexico and smuggle them into the US and Canada for adoption seems to be the key.  Of course, he's not too happy with the woman who clawed his eye out and destroyed his face and has some of his own vengeance in mind.<br />Add to this, a bounty hunter with his own agenda and secretive background, a business man who isn't what he seems, double crossing friends and a bit of romance and lots of intrigue and it makes for one of Linda Howard's most compelling and certainly her most emotionally wrenching books.  <br />Not to give any spoilers but about halfway through I'd figured out some of the whodunits and I was slightly disappointed to see that a few bits and pieces pretty central to the story were left hanging.  <br />Overall though, this is a really good suspense novel, not Howard's usual more romance oriented book, although there is romance and a non-traditional happy ending.  I like to see that Howard is stretching herself, moving past her own genre and doing it really well.	2004-03-05

The idea behind the books is interesting, but the seriously awful writing and even worse editing just made reading this book like chewing tinfoil.<br />I know a small press put this book out but there is simply no excuse for the hundreds of spelling and syntax errors throughout.  Horrible word errors, as in the incorrect words for things were distracting at the very least.<br />Making maters worse was the writing.  Now, I think that if this book had gone through several edits, it could be a really good book, but obviously that didn't happen.  YES!  We know Clint is a high powered attorney, is it necessary to say that every single time he comes into a scene?  Guess what?  High powered attorneys don't introduce themselves as high powered attorney John Doe.  We know Nouri is beautiful so it isn't necessary to say so every three sentences, it's repetitive and interrupts the flow of the story.<br />The sex scenes were pretty terrible.  I like sex in books but it takes a bit of finesse to write sex scenes well and for the most part, they were uninspired.<br />Lastly, the repetitive nature of certain phrases was awful.  Hearing Gabe say the same phrases about how Nouri was going to be the death of him at least 2 dozen times in a chapter was annoying and pointless.  It isn't necessary to repeat things so many times, WE GET IT!  <br />Are we supposed to like anyone except for Gabe?  I mean Nouri is totally screwing Charles over AGAIN, even after he asks her not to toy with him and then is all over Gabe 10 minutes later.  Clint, who supposedly loves Nouri is having sex with some chick he meets on a plane just days after he and Nouri have re-declared their undying love.  Charles, who supposedly loves Nouri is nailing some chick in France.  The only person who has any integrity is Gabe and it looks like Nouri is on her way to destroying that with her constant attempts to seduce him and make him disrespect his friend.  Nouri drinks all day, drives drunk and whines constantly, how does that make her a heroine?<br />I read this book because I'd seen these 5 star reviews but honestly, if it weren't for the potential of the story with more editing and re-writing, I wouldn't even have given it one star and I rarely rate this low.	2004-03-03
US	37113680	R2V6IZYJ383PA0	0843949651	893302337	Noble Intentions	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Not Your Average Regency Romance	I love Katie Macalister's humor.  Whether she's writing contemporaries or historicals you can bet they won't feature faint hearted simpering heroines and empty headed alpha males.  Oh to be sure she's got the alpha males, but they aren't one dimensional and they all seem to appreciate the complex women they fall in love with.<br />In Noble Intentions, Noble Britton is looking for the opposite of his first wife, a sweet biddable woman who will have his heirs and stay in the country while he cats around the capitol.  But when he meets Gillian Leigh, a woman who simply blurts out whatever she's thinking, a woman who is accident prone and at 25, considered off the shelf all of those wishes go out the window because Gillian doesn't care that her husband wants her in the country.<br />What follows is hilarious.  As always, her characters are wonderfully quirky and interesting.  The triplet Tremayne brothers who are constantly brawling, the pirate butler with the hook, Gillian's cousin Charlotte, the union of mistresses - all serve to remove this book from the usual circle of regency romances and make it stand apart.<br />Gillian, though accident prone and lacking in an ability to obey her husband blindly (a good quality), is a great heroine.  She's no blushing virgin and she's a match for Noble, who despite his arrogance, is human and his appreciation for Gillian never wavers.  <br />This book is absent the misunderstandings that cause estrangement that are so often typical in these books.  A moderately interesting mystery surrounding the murder of Noble's first wife threads the love story together.<br />If you like to laugh and you enjoy female characters who are real women who are strong, I think Noble Intentions is a book for you.	2004-02-24

Slayer Black Miracles is an excellent collection of two novellas featuring the Slayer, or rather THE Slayer Alek Knight.  Both novellas were well written and took the characters and macro story arc into more detailed chapters.  <br />I think the storyline is original and interesting, the vampire mythology that Koehler weaves is dark and lonely as per usual vamp stories but at the same time, the involvement of the Vatican and the competing worlds of vampires and Slayers, Coven and Hive is unique.<br />Dragon's Blood brings Alek's blood mate and twin Debra back into the story as he fights to protect a human woman and her son from the Yakuza.  The novella has some interesting twists and a few new vampires to keep it moving.  Nice chemistry between Alek and Robyn as well as an interesting glimpse into the relationship between Alek as a rogue and other master vampires.<br />Immortal introduces another dhampir, Phoenix into Alek's life.  She is attacked by a serial killer and he takes her into his life and the former covenhouse to train her as he was trained by Amadeus.  Again, Alek finds himself wanting a connection and finding one that is illusive.  <br />My only complaint is that this book was simply one of the worst edited pieces I've ever read.  Even a few simple reads of a manuscript should have taken care of at least 60% of the atrocious syntax and spelling errors.  It became distracting and then annoying by the end of Immortal and I hope that in the future, Koehler can at least have someone read the manuscript a few times before it hits the printer.	2004-02-19

Merry and her consorts meet challenge after challenge as the powers that many had given up have returned with the killing of the Nameless from book 2.  Merry herself is struggling with her own feelings of inadequacy even in the face of gaining some significant new powers, the enemies she faces are not as powerful as her own feelings that she is not enough, not pretty enough or powerful enough, not enough of anything.  There is more of her relationship with the Goblins and with the demi fey, which is quite entertaining.  Additionally, she ends up with quite a few new guards and consorts, one or two of which look to figure quite prominently in the next books.<br />This book is much more of a bridge than anything else.  The story is heating up, leading to something larger and I can see how that might be frustrating to some and make them feel negatively about the book but with this book, as with any other in a series, it's about the macro story arc sometimes rather than just the instant story.  With Seduced By Moonlight, it would seem that Hamilton is providing the reader with some material that will sustain through the next two books and while it's unsatisfying because I really do love these characters, it makes me want more.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book immensely.  Some of my favorites from book 1 came back like Sholto and Barinthus and I was happy to see that it looks as if they'll have storylines in upcoming books.  I want more and I hope that Hamilton finishes the next Anita book and gives us a new chapter of Merry's life very soon!	2004-02-05

Frank Herbert created the Duniverse, it was his vision, his baby so while his son can accentuate that, he cannot do the same kind of job.  If you go into reading these books keeping in mind exactly what these books are and aren't, they will be much more enjoyable.<br />I do love the idea of fleshing out all of the things the original Dune series refers to.  I have always wondered just what happened in the Butlerian Jihad and the war with the machines.  I think that the Dune universe is so large, spanning so much time, that to go back that far in time makes it necessary to create a great many threads that will tie into the Dune tapestry and that makes for a very large bundle.  The story is interesting and it creates a platform for those things that are so integral to the later Dune books.  <br />The one real complaint I have is that there are too many threads to keep track of in one book and it, at times, becomes so fragmented that it's distracting.  The chapters were divided well keeping that in mind but I think that a great deal of the storyline wasn't necessary to the story.	2004-01-09

I like the storyline about the super secret organization that is hunting the Carpathians and the psychics because there can only be so many battles with vampires hunting the mates.<br />I like how Feehan is branching out and creating other things to hang books on like the research into why babies have such a hard time surviving the first year, etc.  I'd hate to think that each successive book would just be strong Carpathian male finds his mate who loves him but resists him and then relents formula.  <br />I would have given the book more stars were it not for the most annoying character I've ever read who you were supposed to like.  Lisa should have been left on a hillside with her memory wiped!  Better yet, I wish my memory of her character could have been wiped.  Every time she came onto the page I rolled my eyes, worse yet, Corinne was made a thousand times more annoying by simply liking and trying to accede to the woman's ridiculous demands.  Each time Lisa demanded something utterly stupid and reckless and Corinne ran to her &quot;sure, whatever you want!&quot;  I began to loathe her too.  I wanted Lisa to get kidnapped or killed or removed somehow and all of the wishy washy &quot;oh she had such a hard life that she can't be expected to grasp reality&quot; garbage just rubbed me the wrong way.  I pray she doesn't show up in later books as Cullen's girlfriend.<br />In any case, I did enjoy Dayan as I enjoy the whole branch of the Carpathians he comes from.  It would be nice though, to have more female characters who are really strong and not so stupid.  It's hard, as a strong intelligent woman, not to run screaming into the night when we are supposed to actually believe some of the women in these books are strong (like Joie, who only got a short story in The Only One, but who was truly a strong woman.)	2003-12-25

The sex is not interesting, the characters are stilted, the story is flimsy and just exists to jump from one sex scene to the next and the dialog makes me cringe.<br />Thank goodness for writers like Emma Holly who know how to write sexy books - as in books with well written and hot sex in them but are literate and stand out as more than just a series of sexual encounters.<br />Kate Winthrop lives with two young men, Joe and Sean who are in a relationship.  Kate comes home to find them having sex in her bedroom and when Sean teasingly invites her, she jumps at the chance and the three of them begin a relationship.<br />I can't say that I've really sought out a book with homoerotica in it, this book changed my perspective and although I've since read other books with gay (male) scenes, none of them have been as sexy as the ones Holly wrote in Menage.<br />So thanks Emma!

The writing is compelling and it touches on some really dark subjects with an unexpected warmth and dimension.<br />This book is not really about threesomes, nor would I call it erotica although I see that it's listed as such and the bookjacket seems to give that idea.<br />This story is about the darkness inside of people, the places that exist beneath the surface, lurking in the shadows, waiting to unfurl.  <br />While it seems at times that the darkness lies inside of Ilan, and he surely has some, it's really with Maya.  Maya who loves and yet hates what Ilan is to her, what he evokes from her, the depths to which she's allowed herself to go because of him and yet when he's gone, the darkness isn't and she's left to confront and process her own part in the trauma he's wrought in her life.<br />The book is beautiful in a completely unique way, the writing is wonderful, the story is haunting and gut wrenching.  It's an amazing and worthy read.	2003-09-02

Sookie Stackhouse is a waitress, she's pretty and people think she's crazy.  She's also telepathic and her boyfriend happens to be a vampire named Bill.  <br />Of course, being involved with a vampire comes with its share of problems.  A big one being having to deal with vampire politics.  Once she helped the leader of the vampire nest in Shreveport find out who was embezzling funds from him, she'd outed herself and became incredibly useful at the same time.  Of course, Sookie's \\"gift\\" makes her very attractive to other vampires and she and Bill have found a way to protect themselves from those other vampires by hiring out her special skills to other \\"regions\\" of vampires.<br />On top of having to travel to Dallas to help another vampire nest, a friend and co-worker ends up murdered in the parking lot of the bar she waitresses in.  In between there's an attack by an ancient nature nymph, a sex party, rabid anti vampire right wingers who want to tie her to a vampire forced to \\"meet the dawn,\\" kidnapping, an attempted kidnapping and several instances of being groped by Bill's \\"boss\\" Eric.<br />All of this happens with a great deal of tongue in cheek writing, it's all quite ludicrous but at the same time, the characters are all very likeable and the story seems to work in a very quirky but southern way that Harris works to her advantage.<br />It's different from Hamilton's Anita Blake series because of the quirky silly vibe and as such, I disagree with some of the other reviews that this is a copy.  Sure, it has vampires and shapeshifters but other than that, the comparison really ends there.  Both are very enjoyable series and very well written but they are also very different.  Harris hasn't cribbed anyone's notes here, this book, as well as Dead Until Dark stands on its own and does so quite ably.	2003-08-20

Richard Mayhew, a securities analyst gets drawn into this secret, invisible world when he helps what appears to be an injured homeless woman.  Because of his contact with her and some of the people from her world, he slowly disappears from his own reality.  It seems that most people aboveground cannot deal with the reality of London Below so they conveniently can't see them or anything they do.<br />A classic quest follows with an interesting cast of characters.  Richard and The Lady Door, together with a reprobate Marquis and a bodyguard head off through danger to find answers.  You enter the world of rat speakers, sewer dwellers and secret societies.  It's all very interesting and funny as well as giving the reader the occasional scare.  Below is a world where nothing is what it seems and danger lurks everywhere and yet, its inhabitants seem to derive pleasure from their lives despite that.<br />As with Gods, Gaiman weaves his mythical world into the tapestry of the &quot;reality&quot; of every day life and there are times when you aren't sure if what is happening is just a manifestation of Richard's insanity or not.  It's a nice tension.<br />This book will please the fantasy reader as well as those who love a good mystery.  It's a worthy read.	2003-07-18

All of that is done well and weaved together in a way that has made me a fan of Gabaldon.<br />Claire Randall falls back in time to pre-Culloden Scotland.  A nurse, she gets captured by a band of outlaw highlanders and comes to the aid of a wounded man, Jamie.  The chemistry between Claire and Jamie is written so well, comes across as so genuine that I find it hard to do it justice here.  <br />Through a set of circumstances owing to the strained relations between England and Scotland, the proud and independent highland clans and an English army set on dominating and controlling them, Claire and Jamie are forced to marry, all the while Claire is frantically trying to get back to her own time.  <br />Through the book you learn the history of the proud highland clans and the English occupation of Scotland.  There are tender moments and moments of heartbreaking cruelty.  Jamie and Claire's relationship grows and deepens as the truth of how she ended up in his time comes out.  <br />This book is so wonderful that I've read others in the same vein, or at least say they are in the same vein and I've not read a single one that comes close.  It is a romance that is not stilted or cheesy.  The woman is a true leader, she isn't some quaking 20 year old virgin who shies away from the bad boy trying to seduce her.  Jamie is young but he's not a rogue, he's not trying to run from his feelings for Claire and he is a three dimensional character.<br />I gave this book 5 stars, I rarely do that, even with books I really love.  It deserves each one.	2003-07-16

It seems to miss the idea that if the writing is good, if the characters are actually approaching 3 dimensional, that the story is better and the sex is sexier.<br />Luckily, Wendy Harris does know this and even luckier, her writing is engaging, amusing and quite sexy. There were points where I actually laughed out loud while I read this book.  The characters are 3 dimensional, their interactions are engaging, the sex is hot (although sometimes frustrating and silly as she intends it to be) and the dialog is quite realistic.<br />Pam has a giant millstone around her neck and her name is Janice.  The two have been competing since preschool and now seem to be trapped at the same company, also competing for promotions.  Of course, as this is erotica, the sexual antics ensue but lo and behold so does and actual story.  Pam is witty and sharp and her asides about Janice are truly worth reading.  <br />The humor has that darker British feel, which I appreciate.  If you are looking for more than \\"Insert tab A into slot B\\" type of erotica, give this book a look.	2003-07-14

The sex scenes in the book, especially between Chase and Allison are sizzling and the interaction between the brothers is funny and touching.<br />The book, comprised of three novellas about 3 of the 4 Winston Brothers is a quick and steamy read.  I generally get annoyed with romance novels where the woman is a nervous 20 year old virgin and the sex is described with cutsey euphamisms.  Thankfully, although two of the 3 women are virgins, the writing is anything but cutsey.  This isn't sex with your hands over your eyes, this is sex with your eyes open and bravo to Lori Foster for writing it this way.  <br />My only complaint is that love and marriage happen so quickly, which, given that these men are such romeos, is hard to believe, but then again, it is a romance novel and it's all about fantasy, LOL.	2003-07-01

In fact, I read it in less than 24 hours because I just couldn't put it down.<br />In Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts, things have taken a decidely darker turn.  Lord Voldemort is back and The Order of the Phoenix, the group of wizards and witches who grouped together to stop him last time is reformed and ready for action.<br />But, (and there is always a but) the Ministry of Magic doesn't want to admit it and has come out and denied that Albus Dumbledore is telling the truth, has attacked Harry and has sent one of their own to destabilize Dumbeldore's hold on Hogwarts.  The new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher is more treacherous than Snape and far more dangerous to Harry and the Order's defense against Voldemort.  <br />The story leads Harry away from being \\"The Boy Who Lived\\" to \\"The Boy Who Needs Attention.\\"  Harry struggles with not being believed, with having his mentor Albus Dumbledore cast as a doddering old fool who is going crazy and can't handle Hogwarts anymore.  The Dark is rising but everyone is ignoring it.  It's a paradigm shift for Harry and for the story in general and it keeps the reader uncomfortable and waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br />I won't get too specific because I don't want to give much away but there is a lot of action and suspense and the nearly 900 pages go quite quickly, leaving you sad at the end that you'll be waiting at least another year or so before you see another book.<br />The book is filled with a lot of angst as well it should.  Harry and his friends are after all, 15 years old.  The book is dark and sad and Harry spends a lot of time confused, angry and hurt.  He's trying to figure out who he is and what his place is in his own world.  As is the case with growing up in general, Harry learns that many of the things he's believed were not necessarily as cut and dried as he'd thought.  It's this struggle, the struggle to find out who he is and who the people in his life are, both enemies and friends, that is the core of the story.  <br />A very entertaining read though I'd hesitate a bit at reading it to a child under 6 or 7 at least as a cherished character does get killed and there are many scary moments.	2003-06-27

The narrator is your eye into this world, a world where the China of 1971 is sent hurtling back into the world of the early 19th century.  <br />The book speaks to you through a series of hilarious anecdotes.  From the opening story of how the narrator manages to keep his violin to the every day objects such as alarm clocks and books that become fodder for the teaching moments throughout the book, these funny moments serve to also give clear examples of just how damaging the Cultural Revolution was.<br />The intense yearning of these two young men, to be free to go back to their old lives and familes in the cities, free from the intense scrutiny and hard physical labor of the mountains, is the personification of what the tens of thousands of young people in their situations must have felt at the time. <br />I read this book in two sittings, it's quick and funny and insightful and the english translation is done in a way that keeps the cadence of the Chinese storytelling.	2002-12-17

The writing is pretty good and I think that a few books down the line could be really good.  <br />The book takes us through the lives of several characters - Colin the mysterious demon hunter, Liz the former tabloid writer who is being stalked by a serial killer and Terry, the bodyguard with a hidden past.  Each of their lives becomes connected as they move toward a demonic convergence with apocalyptic proportions.<br />Amusing, entertaining and an easy read.	2002-09-18

She writes what she knows and it's an unusual and interesting perspective.  My Son's Story is a political book no doubt but told from a very personal space, which is the mark of a great story.  Thing is, Gordimer doesn't always write in the most accessible of ways, it is often difficult to get to the larger point she's trying to make, you know it's there but you have to work hard to get it and frankly, there were times when I wasn't sure I was seeing what she wanted me to see.  Gordimer likes to use literary tools to make these macro points, lots of metaphor and at times, it's tiring to try and keep up, I did quite a bit of going back and re-reading.  That said, I believe this to be a great book, it's worth the work I put in but frustrating as well.<br />I encourage others to read Gordimer for her insights into a culture which is thankfully nearly dead by now.  Just go into it knowing that this is not a casual beach read, but you know, a good book sometimes takes work.	2002-09-17

The story unfolds, bit by bit, told through newspaper clippings, chapters from a novel and narration from Iris, Laura's sister.  <br />Iris begins to tell her life story by cutting back and forth through the years, and at the same time, we meet and hear snippets from the lives of her late husband, sister in law, parents and sister, Laura.  <br />I won't go too much into detail because the book is held together by a thread that ties together the lives of everyone Iris Chase-Griffen knows.  <br />The beauty of this book is the way the novel within the novel, Blind Assasin, draws you into the larger story arch.  Yes there is a science fiction story as the jacket describes, but it's the relationship between the man who is narrating the story and the rich woman seeing him on the sly that is the true focus of the story.  As the book goes on, Iris begins to tell her life story and you begin to understand just what the Blind Assasin is and who the characters are.  All of this unfolds as Iris is also writing the story down as she tells it to you.  It's folded, quite interestingly, into itself.<br />It's a very clever way to tell a story and Atwood is quite the storyteller.  Her characters are three dimensional because they all have flaws, as Iris tells you about her maniacial sister in law and husband she makes clever asides about herself and her own complicity.  In many moments I felt that Iris was sitting next to me in Betty's Diner and telling me her story first hand.	2002-09-16

Daneel Olivaw, Book 1)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	A Great Story on Several Levels	Caves of Steel is one of Asimov's best books (well, truthfully the same can be said of every Asimov book I've read).  As Asimov does so well, the book is written on multiple levels and they are all interesting and engaging.<br />At first glance, we have Elijah Bailey, the earther, a New Yorker of the future who lives in the vast underground city. Bailey is a cop put on the case of a murdered Spacer (those humans who have settled other planets).  Bailey is teamed with another investigator R. Daneel Olivaw who we find out later, is a robot.<br />More than just your basic whodunit, this book deals with larger issues of the differences between people that keep them in fear and mistrust of each other.  The Spacers who have embraced the outside world, who have embraced technology and robotics live in fear of the humans who stayed on earth.  Those humans who live in extremely close contact with each other in teeming underground cities as they've all developed a fear of the open sky.  The earthers loathe the Spacers for their superiority complex and the Spacers fear contamination from the earthers.<br />Bailey must overcome these inbred fears and bigotries when he must travel off planet with his partner, a robot, to deal with and solve a murder of a Spacer.  Olivaw (who is a recurring character in many Asimov books) sort of becomes Bailey's moral compass and our guide through the physical and emotional journey Bailey takes.  <br />The book is a quick read and it's good old sci fi at its best.  I recommend also reading \\"The Naked Sun\\" and \\"The Robots of Dawn\\" which also feature Bailey and Olivaw.	2002-09-13

In her travels in the woods, she happens upon a doorway of sorts and out of that doorway walks Corbet Lynn, the cursed grandson, back to rebuild Lynn Hall.<br />Rois becomes obsessed with the curses remembered by the elder townsfolk, curses supposedly called down upon Corbet's father as he stood over the father he has just murdered.  <br />Rois is a great heroine in a genre that oftentimes writes women as helpless or as accessories to the main male character.  McKillip often writes characters who are able to see things that most other people can't see, despite however obvious those things are.  This book is achingly sad at times and like a well written fairy tale, the ending is not what you expect it to be.  McKillip has a way of taking what would be really sappy and trite if it were done in another book or by another author and owning it in such a way that the emotion resonates with the reader.	2002-09-04

Once you can let go of that you can enjoy them for what they are, a nice homage to the world of Dune and the brilliant mind of Frank Herbert.<br />I love the Dune universe, I've read the series once a year for the last 17 years.  I love the characters and the houses and the history that Herbert created so I do quite enjoy the prequels that Herbert's son has co-written because they are the only way I'll hear more about this universe.<br />No, Brian isn't Frank and Frank is a better writer but this is Frank's universe so that shouldn't be surprising.  I liked House Atreides, I thought the book was entertaining and that it fit in with the rest of the Dune books quite well.  Most of all, I like that I can find out what made the characters of the series I love so much into the people they are in later books.  Overall, I do recommend this book without hesitation, even being the geek I am.	2002-09-04
US	37113680	R2N84HFVQBRZKX	0449215571	333950398	Gone to Soldiers	Books	4	30	33	N	N	One of Piercy's Finest Tales	This book is a sweeping history of World War II, told from the perspective of several different characters, all but one Jewish.  We see the war from many views, from the inside of a concentration camp, through a journal, letters and firsthand accounts.  Each character (and there are 10 total) gives something new and interesting to the overall story and the history is built from memory and perspective rather than from a lecture or a history book.<br />Piercy brings you into the minds and hearts of each person as you live inside of their world, chapter by chapter.  It's incredibly well written and entertaining as well as providing a lot of important history	2002-09-04
US	37113680	R1A6ADAFWV8DCY	0441006787	820879497	Song for the Basilisk	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Typical McKillip - beautifully written and engrossing	Rook is a classically trained Bard with a mysterious childhood.  He has nightmares of fire and an odd connection to ravens.  He spends most of his life avoiding looking for himself until a catastrophic event forces him to face his identity.  What follows is an interesting mix of revolution, opera and family dynamics.<br />The book focusses intently on character, which McKillip writes quite well.  Again, the blessed absence of sappy lovestory, there is romance but only in passing and the women are strong and intelligent.	2002-09-04

I've only recently discovered Patricia McKillip and I can't believe I've gone all of this time not knowing such an incredible writer was out there.<br />Cyan Dag, the King's most renowned Knight discovers that the new queen is not what she appears to be.  Instead of the charming beauty everyone else sees, he is able to see the whisper of her 6th finger, her scales and reptilian eyes.  Cyan is then off on a reluctant but earnest quest to free the real Lady of Skye who is trapped in a far off tower.<br />The quest is both literal and metaphorical and Cyan has the true sight that all real heroes should have.  Along the way he comes to understand that things aren't always what they appear to be and the quest is finished but not in the way he sets out to do.<br />Blessedly free of the kind of sappy romance that often wrecks a good fantasy novel of this genre, this book is crafted from beautiful language and imagery and McKillip is now a new favorite of mine.	2002-09-04

I crave books which have unique storylines and characters and follow that with clever writing and an engaging plot.  This book meets those wishes and more.<br />The writing is clever, the characters are three dimensional with funky personalites and personal histories.  I highly recommend this part detective novel/part love story/part character study for anyone who craves a highly unique and entertaining read.	2002-08-26

There are moments when I thought, \\"ah, at last, this is going to get good\\" and then two pages later I was back to feeling bored and antsy. The writing is clever in some spots and very funny but overall, those bright spots just aren't enough. <br />There are interesting moments such as the lessons given about art history but Frayn goes into them in far too much detail such that they become boring and tedious. The characters tend to do things which are unbelievable several times over and in the end, I only finished it because it was for my bookclub and I was the one who made the recommendation to begin with.	2002-08-26
