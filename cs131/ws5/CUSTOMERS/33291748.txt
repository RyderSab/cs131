US	33291748	R3QK0RQ4FV06HR	0312287364	990948943	Feeling Sorry for Celia: A Novel (Ashbury/Brookfield Books (Paperback))	Books	4	5	5	N	N	An equal mix of Good and Bad	This book is about a girl named Elizabeth, who believes that she is \\"failing\\" as a teenager. She has one friend, Celia, and has never been kissed.<br /><br />The first few pages, I was somewhat confused by Moriarty's style of writing, because the book is written all in letters. But after a few pages, it wasn't so confusing anymore.<br /><br />Celia is Elizabeth's only friend for most of the book and while it was obvious that Elizabeth really cares for her, she was extremely irritating to me. From running away to the circus, to stealing Elizabeth's almost-boyfriend, Saxon, to almost committing suicide with the boy, I wanted to scream. Who is really that stupid? And it didn't help was Celia's mother is convinced that she is a \\"budding flower\\" and all the (stupid) things she does are \\"beautiful\\". I was more than happy when Elizabeth finds a friend in her penpal, Christina, who lives in the same town. Christina has girlish issues with her boyfriend throughout the book, while still being smart and interesting.<br /><br />Elizabeth was also an interesting character herself. She is strong and sure of herself. Her quirky, slightly-activist mother looks to Elizabeth to care for the house. She has an ongoing argument with Saxon's mother over whether people should be allowed to rollerblade at the local mall. (Elizabeth is convinced that her mother has no idea what rollerblading actually is.) And her father has been lying to Elizabeth since she was a baby. I got just as angry at him as Elizabeth did.<br /><br />I found this book to be an equal mix of great and not-so-great. Celia, Elizabeth's liar father and Celia's crazy mother all made me want to throw the book on the floor, while Christina, Elizabeth and Elizabeth's rollerblade-activist mother kept me reading. While this may sound like an ordinary teenage girl book, it's really not fake and stupid and also while this book wasn't my favorite, the good outweighed the bad.	2005-05-25

So when her father proposes a marriage, she is furious. She outruns all her suitors in a marriage-or-death race, but one.<br /><br />Andromeda is betrothed to someone whom she wants nothing to do with. Her mother makes the mistake of proclaiming that both she and Andromeda are more beautiful than the goddesses. Andromeda is sent to death, but something happens that changes that.<br /><br />Psyche is one of the most beautiful women alive. One day, a nameless immortal asks for her hand in marriage. Psyche goes to the man's home and is never happier, until she makes a horrible mistake.<br /><br />I LOVED Psyche's story and I wish that McLaren had made Psyche's story a book alone. While this is not my favorite Greek myths book, it is worth reading.<br /><br />~Atalanta	2005-03-30

Bridget impulsively leaves for Alabama and spends the summer working for her grandmother, but uses an alias for a long time. Tibby heads off to film school and finds out just how much Brian means to her and more or less comes to terms with Bailey's death. Carmen deals with her mother starting to date a new man and Lena tries to get over Kostos, just as he shows up in her life again.<br /><br />The way this story unfolds is totally interesting and as each girl's story progressed, I could definitely see each girl's individual strengths and weaknesses. I really was hoping this book would never end, but luckily there is a third book.<br /><br />Reading the first book is a must to understand what is going on in this book, but as I mentioned the first is just as good as this one. A must read. It made me wish my friends and I could be \\"the Sisterhood\\".<br /><br />~Atalanta	2005-03-26

She takes drugs at the party and continues to do so until she decides to go back home. Not long after, Alice once again falls in with the wrong crowd again and does drugs. In a very short time span, Alice runs away twice and stays away from her home, usually with a then-friend. She is constantly saying that she wants to change and she never wants to touch drugs again. Her family is still surprising loving and she meets a boy who loves her, too.<br /><br />I almost cried at the end of the book. This is very sad and a very powerful book.

Bobby has an extremely hard time taking care of Feather and going to school,  after getting no sleep every night.

Unfortunately, I did not fall in love with this book like I did the others.<br /><br />Alison is a smart girl with one good friend. Alison's mother died the year before and Alison is feeling withdrawn. A new boy, named Patrick, moves into her tiny home town and both Alison and her best friend, Laurie, get crushes on him. It turns out that Patrick likes Alison, and not Laurie, which leads to Laurie and Alison fighting. Then something happens that changes Alison's life forever, just as her mother's death did.<br /><br />I did not feel that this book kept up pace and by the end of the book, the whole story had changed completely and the plot line was not consistent. By the end I was asking many questions that did not get answered. What happens between Alison and Patrick? Why did the story have to change so suddenly?<br /><br />This was an average teen book, but definitely not the best. Look to Clark's other books for better reading.<br /><br />~Atalanta	2005-03-03

I admit that when I picked this book up and read the first few pages, I wasn't optimistic about how the book was going to be. But after I got into, I realized how much I absolutely LOVE this book!<br /><br />Jessica is the youngest daughter to a stereotypical \\"Blonde\\" mother and a completely sports-oriented father who talks about nothing but her track record. Jessica's best friend, Hope, moves away, which (she says) forces her to spend her time with a group of dumb cheerleaders, whom she dubbs The Clueless Crew. Jess is \\"in love\\" with a senior who doesn't know she exists and has been mysteriously talked to multiple times by one of the school rebels.<br /><br />Jessica's narrative (written in diary form) is extremely entertaining and funny. I found myself laughing even if I was in public. And I was surprised to find that some of the things that Jess says about her life and the people in it, I could relate to.<br /><br />A GREAT, fun, entertaining and very memorable read.

Alice has been homeschooled all her life after a somewhat traumatic incident between some other girls in kindergarten. When Alice is 15, she decides to go back to public school.<br /><br />Alice has a list of things that she wants to do in her life, which leads to her doing and saying things that made me laugh, even if I was in public. Alice's narrative of her day-to-day life is hilarious and perpetually interesting. Many of the things she says, I couldn't help quoting at times. This book is happy and would make for a good, light summer read. I would definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />~Atalanta	2005-02-14

Sam is the girl who has only one friend and wears all black; she's not exactly the most popular girl. Sam is also in love with Lucy's 'radical' boyfriend, Jack. As punishment for selling her (great) celebrity drawings to her fellow students, Sam's parents force her to go to art class. (Which turned out not to be so bad after all.) The next week, instead of going to art class and facing her art teacher who had embarassed her the week before, Sam goes into the music store under the art studio. There she ends up saving the president of the United States from attempted murder. Soon after, Sam realizes her true feelings for the president's son and Jack.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters in this book and how well they were explained and drawn. I found all the characters loveable in their own seperate ways, especially Sam's best friend Catherine and Lucy's boyfriend and Sam's \\"soul mate\\", Jack. Sam's narrative is fun and humorous and never got old to me. As I said, this book is unrealistic, but interesting and would make a great rainy-day read.<br /><br />~Atalanta	2005-02-14

This home that Regine goes to live in is loveless, but relatively safe. Despite being safe, Regine moves once again to another home that is also loveless. This story follows Regine through her life during The War and all the homes she is moved in and out of.<br /><br />This is an easy-to-read book and simply told.

He ends up going back in time to 1908 and meets a few boys who end up being his friends.<br /><br />As I said, this book should be strictly for a younger audience.

Anne, who Mary is sure is a witch and has bewitched her father, will stop at nothing to take the throne.<br /><br />This book is very factual and a good read, even for people who may not be interested in this time period or subject.

When Lola's mother moves her and her two totally gross little sisters out of New York City and into the suburbs, Lola is sure she will be the savior to so many poor souls in Dellwood. Or as she calls it, Deadwood. Then she meets Carla Santini, the local bully and snob, and that whole part of the book's (the WHOLE book!) is pretty predictable. It's through Lola's obsessive love for her favorite band, Sidhartha, that Lola gets her and her best friend and \\"sister of my soul\\", Ella, alot of... adventure.<br />I won't give away the rest. Parts of this book was really funny and it was hard not to laugh out loud, whether I was in public or not, but Lola's interpretation of every thing got boring.

I kept seeing this book at the book store, & it looked good, but when I looked online, it seemed like nobody could make up their mind, do they like it or not? Well, I bought it @ the store & I couldn't put this book down! This was really good! I read it in one sitting. If some one asked me if it was good enough to read a second time, it is. A MUST READ!

I got it cuz I was looking for any thing about Afghanistan that was within or around my age range. I thought this book would be boring, and while @ times this book was a little slow, it was very, very good. Now I know how it really is to life in Afghanistan. It made me very grateful for what we have in the U.S. You'll like this book, I'm sure of it. Read this book!	2003-03-09

It barely had any thing about what happened December 7th. It was some what interesting, but it had hardly any thing to do w/ it's subject. Not really worth reading. Even if you know every thing or if you know nothing about Pearl Harbor, this isn't a good book. I won't be reading(or recomending) this book again.<br />~Atalanta	2003-03-07

I couldn't even start to explain how much I love this book! Oyuna was just a baby when \\"the horse chose her\\". Oyuna means the horse chose her to have a crushed foot all her life. To be free on the back of a horse, & to be crippled on the ground. Oyuna goes to the fair when she is 12 or 13 to find her swift horse to win the race to get/win/make luck for her family. But instead, she chooses an old, lame mare. She does because the mare talked to her. (\\"Help me out of here!\\") Slowly but surely, her mare gets better & Oyuna names her Bayan, meaning \\"beauty & goodness\\". Every one thinks it is strange that she named her horse. Naming an animal was extremely strange. The Kahn's soldiers come into Oyuna's village 1 day & take Bayan. They start taking men & boys from the village, too, as new soldiers for the Kahn. The commander comes into Oyuna's family's tent & chooses her slightly older step brother to be a soldier. Since Oyuna's grandmother told her to never loose her mare, Oyuna takes her step- brothers uniform & goes out & saddles Bayan, pretending to be a boy. Now, I won't tell u anything else, you'll just have to read it, but this was a great, great book. It doesn't deserve 5 stars, it deserves 5 million! This book is a great example of the loyalty of animals & all they sacrifice for us. This is one of my favorite books. Oyuna has such an amazing adventure, I wish I could do that w/ my horse & my cat! (Bator is her funny, loyal cat) Read this book! You'll love it, I promise you!	2003-03-07

This is how it is to get lost on an island for years and years. I live near the California coast, so I went to the mission where Karana was buried & saw her grave! This book starts were Karana & her brother see a ship while gathering stuff on the coast of their island, San Nicholas. The Aluts come & her tribe has to leave their beloved island. Karana's brother is left on the island by accident, so Karana jumps off the boat, into the sea & back to the island to some how get her brother back on the ship. (hopefully) But, unfortunately, the boat does not come back & they r left alone on San Nicholas. Karana comes upon many, many troubles, one of the 1st major ones is...

At times it seemed a little boring, but it was very good. I would change it some what, though. It really bugged me that when the guy she liked left for the war (I forgot his name) he just said, \\"Wait for me.\\" I just sat there reading like a maniac to see what exactly would happen, but nothing interesting did happen between them. I would probably read this book again, but I will probably not be. Worth reading, though.	2003-03-06

I was so touched, so mesmerized! I could NEVER put this book down!

Well, then her father writes her a letter, enclosing 3 boat tickets to America, Tata (her father) has found her a husband in the coal fields! As you could imagiane, Anetka is pretty upset.

Babcia (grandma) gives her ticket to the private, Leon Nashevich, saying that she has lived her whole life in Poland and would never leave. So on the boat ride over, the waves get pretty rough between Leon and Anetka. Once at Ellis Island, Leon is taken away and Anetka and Josef go on to the coal fields w/o him. 4th of July comes and Anetka meets her fiance'. What is he like? Well, read the book and find out!

Parvati is born during the biggest storm India can remember and every one in the village blames it on her. Parvati is different. She has a 6th sense w/ animals and much more happens to her, stuff that wouldn't happen to normal people. A man comes to her house one day and offers her a place @ a dancing school where only very gifted dancers go. Parvati goes to give her mother the money she gets from being @ the school. (payed to go to school!? WOW! That would be GREAT!!) Parvati & her school mates go to Parvati's home town to perform for the Raja. (is that what it's called?) Parvati then meets the prince. An oddball, like her and if I'm remembering right, born on the same day as her. They eventually fall in love. The prince knows all the secret passage ways through the palace and can get to Parvati's room through her closet! Now, this part I didn't like much. He's came whenever he pleased at times & b-4 they really love each other, Parvati is snappy and the prince bratty. I didn't like this part @ all. This is why I give the book 4 stars and not 5. Not the best book, but good. I wouldn't choose to read it again, but it was okay. If u love India or dance, you'll like this book. But if you've got a short attention span, I wouldn't say u'd like this book.	2003-03-01
