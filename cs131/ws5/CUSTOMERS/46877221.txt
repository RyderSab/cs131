The story of &quot;sweet&quot; little Rhoda actually seems more plausible today than it did when first written.  The author did have to go to considerable pains to create suspension of disbelief in the story's plausibility, and he succeeded.  <br />The book was made into a stage play and a movie.  The movie suffered because the book ending was in that day and age contrary to the production code.  So if you saw the movie, absolutely read the book and don't expect the same ending.	2004-05-19

Unlike most of those who agree with me, I've gritted my teeth and continued through the series cringing as the woman mows over other characters with complete lack of human compassion or sense of her impact on those around her.  <br />I do agree that Carol O'Connell is a powerful story teller who brings her quirky and often surrealistic characters to life.  With this fourth book in the series, I do feel more of a hook which keeps me reading Mallory.  This book takes her to her roots and I find myself beginning to understand her a bit better, but I still have trouble liking her.  And I have difficulty respecting Charles Butler, rather pitying his obsessive love for this person.  But although I felt as if I was plodding through the book, I feel a growing fascination.<br />So in this review, I speak especially to those others who hate Mallory in tentatively recommending the book.  You do learn more about her and the revelation as to why she insists on being called Mallory rather than by her given name.  You may well find yourself caught up a bit more in this series.  I read somewhere that Mallory is definitely, for many of us an acquired taste and my reaction was who in his right mind would want to acquire a taste for her.  <br />But as I labelled this review, it is a turning point and if you've gotten this far in the series, it may be worth your while to continue with this book.	2004-01-06

I hated this ... from the first book and while other readers gave up on her after a couple of books, I kept plodding away.  As despicable as I found the main character, the writing had a powerful spell over me as I found myself involved in Mallory's perverted and quirky world.  STONE ANGEL was a turning point, and this book continues the revelations started in the earlier book.  <br />Part of what makes me continue reading the series is the hope that there is some spark of humanity in the woman, and there are indeed times that it looks like there is one there, but then there's the feeling that the character has coldly manipulated those around her to believe there's something that isn't there.  <br />If you are to tackle this series, you should start from the beginning, MALLORY'S ORACLE, and be prepared for a long arduous journey into the character's psyche.  There is a feeling of development in this book, but there's also frustration because the development is slow in coming.  And yet I feel now that there is something coming up in the series that will reward me for continuing my relationship with Mallory.	2004-01-06

But now, these calendars have a spiral format and when you get to June 30, you flip it over and read the devotions on the back of the pages you've previously read.  <br />The inspirations are the same, and the thoughts are nicely arranged in a sequence which develops spiritual thinking throughout the year.

This collection isn't for the faint-of-heart, nor for the easily offended. John Shirley holds nothing back, and these stories are thoroughly chilling, sexually perverse, and from a world we don't really want to know. We meet characters we don't really want to know such as the title lady in the first story, \\"Barbara\\", a victim of a carjacking who in her weirdness takes over the situation and takes her carjackers into her own perverted world. Then there's the cop who suspects his partner has murdered his own wife. A subway trip during an earthquake. A probing into the psyches of slasher movie fans. A televangelist telecasting from one of the most satanic appearing rock cafes. An immortal slaughtering Earth's remaining population. These are stories to be taken one at a time. Maybe they're not all great, but you'll find several you won't forget.	2004-01-02

This is a necessary introduction to the Dark Tower series, arguably Stephen King's greatest contribution to fantasy.<br />It's not truly a stand alone book.  Therefore, you're not going to have complete understanding of where this is going until you get there.  Therefore, the best way to read it is to just experience it.  <br />Roland in this book is best pictured as a western gunslinger, but we do learn that isn't his origin.  Nor do we know for sure exactly where all this is occuring.  A significant scene has Roland asking Mr. Brown whether he believes in an afterlife, and Mr. Brown answers that he thinks this is it.  <br />This opening volume takes us with Roland in his pursuit of the Man In Black.  Don't expect to find out just who this personage is.  Just go with the trip and then grab the next volume.<br />Trust me, you'll be glad you did.	2003-12-04
US	46877221	R20L7CG42PEPSO	0425193063	101905400	Blue Moon	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Highly unrealistic nostalgic fun	Ah yes, this is full of nostalgia, maybe almost but not quite to the point of irritation. <br />Philip Damon, bearing a strong resemblance to band leader/co-author Peter Duchin, plays amateur detective when a man accompanying a woman who is remarkably similar in appearance to Damon's murdered wife is himself murdered.  Hobnobbing with practically every celebrity who was prominent in 1963, he investigates the murder much to the consternation of black San Francisco Police Inspector Hercules Platt who is having his own problem convincing his superiors and those he deals with that he is a very capable inspector.  <br />This is a light-hearted portrayal of the early '60's alluding to the social changes going on at the time including racial issues, growing drug use, rock & roll replacing swing era music, and acceptance of gays, as well as providing us with an old-fashioned type of mystery featuring the amateur sleuth.	2003-12-03

This first novel introduces us to Kathy Mallory, but don't you call her Kathy!  Her fellow workers don't much like her and I don't either.  Charles likes her and he's a rather messed up guy himself.  We first meet her when she beats up a kid, and though the kid's a punk himself, this just isn't the kind of behavior I'd expect from New York's finest.  <br />The story for what it is takes place in 11 rather long chapters and occupies itself with victims and suspects who are difficult to care for.<br />I am planning on reading more in the series, but only because I'm hoping that the author allows Mallory to eventually mellow out and have some kind of honor and compassion.	2003-10-09

This is the second Mallory book and if I thought she was a cold hearted witch in her first book, I lack words to describe her in this one.  Completely lacking in compassion, she bulldozes her way through an investigation of a woman's murder without regard to how she's messing up their lives.  This complete lack of feeling extends to animals including the murder victim's unfortunate cat who's suffered enough abuse without landing in the care of a woman who proceeds to use the cat to trap the murderer.  And kids, forget it.  Given, she runs into child prostitutes and other unfortunates, but she's too busy to follow through when she places one girl into detox, too busy to make any arrangements for the poor girl to go anyplace where she'll have a chance when she gets out of detox.  She's also too busy to be concerned about a boy in a very strange situation who calls her for help.  The ending practically indicates that the author has no more concern for her characters, be they adult, child, or animal, than does her leading character.  <br />The story is told in seven very long chapters, chapters that are difficult to get through if you're as unsympathetic to the main characters as I was.  We are given insight into Mallory's childhood, but what we're told doesn't as much explain why Mallory is what she is as it shows that she was the same cold and calculating individual as a 7 year old as she is now.  One reviewer made it clear that she's not reading any more Mallory, and the ending of this book should keep me from reading more, but I have this hope that maybe the author will allow Mallory to someday become a human being.	2003-10-09

I found the book highly entertaining and fun to read.  It introduces a keen female lawyer and takes us through her first murder trial.  Actually, it was supposed to be a divorce case, but the husband being divorced managed to end up dead leaving his estranged wife the #1 suspect.  <br />However, this book is full of factual errors.  Other reviewers have pointed out some of these errors, but the one I spotted has to do with the church the accused wife's parents are active in and have worked for, Science Of Mind.  The parents and therefore the authors have the church completely confused with Christian Science.  Science Of Mind or Religious Science was founded by Ernest Holmes in Los Angeles, not Mary Baker Eddy in Boston.  The church, although it, like Christian Science, has practioners does not discourage members from seeking medical treatment (many SOM ministers have their medical doctors, have been in the hospital, undergone surgery, etc.).  And Science Of Mind like Christian Science does not believe in Hell and yet the wife's mother tells her daughter that she will burn in Hell because of the life she's led.<br />Okay, the above doesn't even have a heavy bearing on the story, but all of these errors about the church along with the geographical and other factual errors are presented as fact in the book.  So how is one to trust these authors' legal knowledge?  Indeed, there seem to me to be several large holes in the legalistic details of the story although I admittedly am no lawyer.<br />Again, the story itself is engrossing although the denouement had too many unrelated and coincidental elements to please me.  So while the story itself is too good to give a one or two star rating, there's too much almost sloppy writing to give it four or five stars.  If you're looking for a mystery that's fast and light reading and aren't bothered by factual errors &amp; dubious legality, you'll likely enjoy it.	2003-09-19

And there's nothing dull or out-dated here (well, maybe that paying $10 to be driven from Las Vegas to L. A. is a bit out of date).<br />Archer's hired to discover who sent his client's husband a letter accusing her of infidelity.  Introduced to the family and friends at a party as a Hollywood agent, he is sensitive to the growing tension and explosive atmosphere.  The reader knows of course that somebody's going to be murdered, but these early chapters are among the most skillfully written to build suspense that I've ever read.  <br />Written in 1950, the inclusion of a homosexual couple was quite daring although there is not graphic description, and isn't significant enough a factor of the plot to either offend or attract a reader.  <br />Read this and I'm sure you'll find it on your own list of crime classics.	2003-07-24

Here, we're first introduced to the Bear entity which at first appears purely malignant and evil, but is developed most interestingly as the story develops.  As in the earlier book, we become involved in the political intrigues of the historical period.  <br />There's more humor, grisly though it sometimes is, in this book as the bear spirit encounters and then possesses Hugo.  This humor is welcome, because the number of characters with their various intrigues does become a bit much, especially with a couple of inordinately long chapters that leave no convenient breaking points.  <br />There's less emphasis on the relationship between the woman Regeane and her wolf identity, and I miss that.  <br />However, fans of the original book should welcome this one.	2003-07-24

This Lew Archer novel is in that tradition in that it doesn't break any taboos, but it does hint at it.  If THE CHILL were written today, I think it would have been a bit more direct.  <br />As with many Lew Archer cases, this one starts innocently enough with his being hired to find a missing newlywed who's disappeared after an encounter with a mysterious visitor. In a short period of time, he's involved in a murder case, one in which he feels a vague sense of being responsible.  There are the usual twists, the usual questions of identity, the interconnection of characters which doesn't at first meet the eye.  <br />MacDonald characters are difficult to pigeonhole into &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; categories.  The motivations often come from deeply within the psyches of the characters.  <br />The emphasis in this story as well as most in the series is on the puzzle.  There are seldom recurring characters in these novels, and little interaction other than investigative betwee Archer and the other characters.  And as always, the dark corners of human nature are well probed.<br />Definitely highly recommended.	2003-07-22

I did groan a bit when the sims, Joan of Arc and Voltaire, came back in it, but Bear got stuck with them thanks to Benford's bizarre plotting, and did what he could with them.  <br />Basically, this deals with Hari Seldon's trial and the conflict between two factions of robots, those who identify with Susan Calvin, the pioneer in Robotics, and those who identify with the legendery R. Daneel Olivaw.  Throw in a couple of mentalists at odds with each other, and you have a rather good Foundation novel.<br />Read FOUNDATION'S FEAR if you think you must, but it's not necessary because this far better written second novel stands well by itself.	2003-07-21

For Lehane, it is lighter and maybe it's as close to comic as he's capable of being.  <br />Our two detectives are kidnapped and subsequently hired to trace down an obscenely rich man's daughter.  It turns out that the last detective hired to find her, not so coincidentally the detective who originally trained Kenzie, has also disappeared.  This leads the pair first through a phony counseling center which is tied in with a religious cult and then to Florida which state is lightly satirized, but no more so than Lehane's native Boston, and then after a couple of plot twists, back to Boston.<br />There are a lot of references to the previous book and some out and out spoilers, so I definitely advise you to read the first two books before you read this one.<br />I don't mind his lightening things up, nor do I mind his having a bit of fun at Florida's expense because he says nothing about it that my friends &amp; relatives in Florida haven't said.  But I do mind his going overboard in the final third of the book and handing us an ending that's too incredible to believe.  And that ending is the reason for the three stars.  <br />However, the ride through the first 2/3 of the book is indeed enjoyable, and I won't discourage you from reading it, but be prepared.	2003-07-21

Then there is the nature of villains they face...not robots programmed to kill but cyborgs with some human qualities (but not those that will make them more likeable) directing terminators.  There's the slow progress being made by Skynet which prompts changing strategies on the part of our heroes.  Finally, we have the philosophical theories concerning time which suggests that any attempts to change the future are defeated by the nature of times itself.  Rather a fatalistic, pre-deterministic stance, but interesting.<br />Both of these volumes are highly recommended.	2003-07-21

Like the title warns you, it is indeed dark, and peers into a darkness within the souls of the characters.<br />The prologue sets us up to be prepared for some rather serious and unhappy occurances in the book...maybe not what we expect, but still we're warned that this book won't be all fun and games.  <br />The woman who hires Kenzie fears that she and her son are being targeted and this leads him eventually into the tracking of a serial killer who may have been involved with murders that occured 20 years ago.  Eventually, he finds connections even with his own family and neighborhood.  <br />There's an undercurrent in the novel touching on how violence poisons the inner being of all involved, a theme that apparantly is recurrent in Lehane's books.  <br />There's genuine literary quality in Lehane's writings.  There's also a tragic and fatalistic aura about his stories.  Kenzie is faced not only with the challenge of doing the jobs he's hired for but also with the challenge of retaining his own soul, his own feeling of rightness.<br />This works both as a well plotted mystery and also as a walk on the very dark side of human nature.	2003-07-15

This gives a deeper understanding of just what Skynet is up to and importantly, why.  <br />Secondly, the character of Dieter von Rossbach was a true inspiration.  There is a logic here.  Certainly, those who designed the first robots would use a human model, and a brave, intrepid secret agent would be a logical one.  Less logical is his meeting Sarah Connor, but as each would seek an area of privacy but also access to illegal arms, forged papers, etc., it isn't completely out of the realm of possibility that they'd be in the same place at the same time.<br />Thirdly, the story is a development of the original, and the emphasis is on the story with sufficient action and violence but not enough to overwhelm the story itself.  <br />The ending has enough of a hook to it that you'll likely be ready to read T2: RISING STORM after finishing this one.<br />This is much more than just a movie novel.	2003-07-15

Fluffy, yes, but still entertaining, and so I figured I'd read the book it was based on.<br />Well, there are few points to the book not in the movie.  However, the characters, all of them, seem much shallower than they seemed in the movie.  Not so much shallow in the author's portrayals, but more just shallow people with some intelligence, but little emotional depth to their characters.  As a book that appeals to younger women, I sure would have liked to have seen more awareness of values.	2003-07-15

Parker meets Anne Rice	I've just started reading this series and am quite impressed with this first book.  <br />Anita Blake does remind me a bit of Spenser.  There's much of the toughness along with the Spenser type humor.  <br />For an introductory novel, there are a lot of references & questions concerning the past.  That's not too big a deal though.<br />In an alternate world where vampires walk among us, Anita Blake becomes involved in finding out who's been killing vampires in St. Louis.  Through this, she encounters the master, and this is one of the creepiest supernatural villains I've met.  She's plunged into a world of real horror, of very dangerous creatures and those who are controlled by the master of vampires.  <br />Once the story gets started, there are many grisly situations all viewed through Anita's eyes.  The horror is somewhat filtered through the heroine's wryly humorous nature.  And there is an erotic feel although, at least in this installment of the series, there isn't any real sex described.  <br />All in all, recommended to those who enjoy the combination of detective and horror genres.	2003-07-11

Those who prefer to read critically and who consider themselves superior to those of us who are more relaxed and uncritical in our reading will find little technical details to grouse about.<br />Alice Borchardt's werewolves have a distinct difference from those in other books.  Her books portray the human personality and the wolf personality as two separate personalities in the same body, personalities who are compatable and able to communicate with each other.  I liked this idea myself and felt it quite enhanced the tale.<br />Basically, this is the story of the heroine who's being used by her uncle and cousin to make them rich by marrying a barbarian noble and then in time killing him.  But this is a gal who strives to be a liberated woman even in ancient Rome, and as such goes through several adventures both as a woman and as a wolf.  The details are richly painted, and the action is fairly sustained throughout.  It's a romance, but not too syrupy for us guys to appreciate.  There are predictable elements here, but like I say, just relax and let the author tell her story and I think you'll enjoy it.  (Unless you'd rather be a nitpicker).	2003-07-10

I especially wonder what happened to Raich who Hari &amp; Dors seemed to be taking in as a son.  <br />It is much too heavily laden down with technical talk.  There's precious little action on any level for much of the book.  Therefore, reading it does become a bit of a chore, not the fun it was reading Asimov's stories.  <br />You'll probably want to read it as preparation for the other two books, so just be prepared not to be very excited by it.	2003-07-08

However, realizing this is a first novel, I knew this wasn't so.  But we are given so many bits and pieces about how the lady became a werewolf and became part of The Pack before leaving it to try to lead a more normal life, that I did kinda wish that those had been put into a prior novel.  Oh well, maybe a prequel will someday be written?<br />Other than that, this is one terrific read.  You can throw out your previous conceptions of werewolves.  These guys wouldn't be too bad to have polite discussion with.  Maybe they're a bit sanitized, a bit PC, but not annoyingly so.  They can still get mad enough to kill a human if necessary.  <br />There is one point in the later part of the tale that drug a bit and read a little too much like a romance rather than a supernatural story, but once that sequence was over, the story regained its pace and continued to a satisfying conclusion.<br />So I can't feel justified in giving it five stars, but it's definitely worth reading and rates four stars.	2003-07-07

It takes place 200 years before the Vorkosigan stories, and follows Leo Graf, an engineer sent to the planet Rodeo to be a welding instructor to the genetically altered Quaddies.  <br />He immediately discovers an attitude on the part of the administrators on the planet toward these mutated beings, but takes them as they are, a human species most of whom are still developing youngsters.  <br />This is primarily an adventure story with well developed human and mutated human characters.  There are tender scenes such as that between Silver who's deeply attuned to music and Madame Minchenko, the project physician's wife who also is deeply musically inclined.  But there's also plenty of action, and the underlying plea for respect for all forms of life.<br />Read for enjoyment and I think you'll quite appreciate it.	2003-07-07

Lew Archer's role is that of the puzzle solver, and you are not as involved with him and his character development as you are with the characters.  <br />This is possibly his most satisfying story and like most of the other reviewers, I choose to let you discover the story for yourself.  If you have read previous MacDonald, you may spot elements of the story before they're completely revealed, but this hardly will diminish your enjoyment of the book.  It might even enhance it.  There's much more of interest here than just the identity of the murderer.  There's a lot of figuring out the essences of the people involved, and they do act consistently.  <br />There is one minor stretch of credibility in this particular book, one rather unlikely coincidence, but it's a realistic coincidence, one which fits nicely as one of the coincidences that do occur in real life and does not seem like the author's contrivance.  <br />I don't think it makes any appreciable difference whether or not you've read any other MacDonald works or not.  This will read well as the first one or the later one.  <br />One of the great mystery novels, for sure.	2003-07-07

The story remains dead serious and delves deeper into the motivations of society than sheer realism reveals.<br />We are told the life and times of Robert Borrows, an Englishman in a Victorian age which is influenced by a dark magic.  It takes him from childhood as he first rebels against the society he's born into and then as an adult against the basic society.  We're given the full story of his revolution and face essential questions which involve the issue of just what the revolutionary is truly revolting against and of the inevitable consequences of such revolt.<br />The story-telling is highly evocative and set against a darkly surrealistic backdrop.  Idealism is portrayed along with the traps that go with this idealism.  Obsession is looked at and dissected.<br />This novel isn't for Jordan and Tolkien fans, at least not for those unwilling to look deeply enough to see what is real at the bottom of the fantasy.<br />A key point to understanding this book is the protagonist's discovery that his lifetime adversary is merely human and that this discovery is somehow a disappointment. Then comes the question as to just who is the true adversary.<br />This is not a book for fast reading, but more of one to allow oneself to become absorbed in.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-07

It's quite literate with good vocabulary for the reading level.  Importantly, though it's fun.  While conveying the spirit of the comic book character, Teitelbaum brings in related bits of information aimed at increasing the young reader's knowledge while stimulating youthful curiosity into learning more about the Hulk's literary predecessers, about early concerns about nuclear energy, about the cold war and its anxieties, about the fields of scientific research along with other topics.<br />The emphasis though is on entertainment which is what should draw the young readers into reading it, strengthening reading skills and expanding their knowledge at the same time.	2003-07-07

However, little has been said about the racial themes in the book other than one negative review by an intelligent reviewer, but one who somehow got the wrong message.<br />There are a number of black characters in the book, very unlike from each other.  There are also a number of characters who use derogatory terms against blacks, and Lehane characterizes these people by the words they use in many cases.  A reader who gives the book a quick read might misunderstand the author's perspective.  But Lehane does deliver a message that says people are people, individual people.  The prejudices of these people say something about the individual bearing such prejudices.<br />Yet, Lehane also suggests, especially in one of the climactic scenes, that we are all contaminated by the aura of prejudice.  In one telling sequence, the main character, Kenzie, succumbs to the poison of prejudice in his thinking.  Fortunately, he shakes off the effects of this poison.<br />So what I am saying to those who read this book, especially Afro-Americans, is to not read the book too quickly, and to realize that although some of the author's characters use ugly language, the author is definitely not in love with all of his characters and shows that in his narration.  In fact, he is saying something about those particular characters if you read carefully enough to hear what he says.	2003-07-07

While the translator's forward might lead us to expect this to bear heavy influences of Asimov, Heinlein, and Arthur C. Clark, these three short novels are unmistakably Chinese.  The cultural and historical backgrounds along with snatches of Taoism and a self-mocking attitude lend a quirkiness we of the Western hemisphere are not used to.  One may well need to have read through the entire story told in the three tales before understanding many of the points of the narrative.<br />The city here is Sunlon City.  We're told in an early footnote that the name is generally considered merely joining sun (the Hui-Hui's planet has a purple one) with &quot;lon&quot; from Babylon.  However, as the footnote also tells us, Sun also means man and lon eat, thus Sunlon City can also be interpreted as &quot;man-eating city&quot;.  <br />In the prologue, we're told about the huge bronze statue that long predominated the city square, a statue that appeared to grow larger and more formidable with time, but which is ultimately destroyed.  Yet many believe that the spirit of the statue persists, and such belief is encouraged by the Bronze Statue Cult.  <br />The Hui-Huis share the planet with other races, especially the Serpent People, the Leopard People, and the lesser mentioned Feathered People.  In addition, the city itself has several conflicting societies.  All these are ruled by the Shan, invaders from another planet.  <br />Miss Qi is a central figure as the city prepares for revolution.  Through the three stories, we see the city torn by strife and the rise of a dictator.  There are many battles and the question arises as to who is the true enemy of Sunlon City.<br />The story here obviously is allegorical, quite applicable to our times.  But again, be prepared for Oriental thinking which is indeed not what most of us are used to.  The various races may well seem outlandish, especially the chus whose faces are on the top of their heads.  And there's a continual strange humor, one which often does appear to be self-mocking.  <br />This book is well worth reading, but I didn't tell you it would be easy.  (and it isn't)	2003-06-26

Right off hand, you know this is a suicidal heroine, but you don't know why.  You also get the idea that one of the characters might be an unidentified wizard, but you don't know that for sure.  And it is very much to the author's credit that both questions are resolved by the end of the book in such a way that's true to the characters involved, rather than carrying them over to the next book.<br />Obviously, THE FALL OF ILE-RIEN trilogy will be concerned with revolution and social change in this land of magic and of wizards.  The beginning book deals with the attack and conquest of this land by the Gardier, a mysterious enemy helped by their evil wizards.  Tremaine Vallarde who lacks magical skills but possesses a sphere which has within it power to defeat the Gardier finds herself along with a female student wizard, a former guardian with wizardly powers, and a young security agent who's apparantly enamored of her transported to a strange world.  The Gardier are using a base on this world as a gateway to Ile-Rien.  The wizard hunters referred to in the book's titled belong to a race which knows only of the evil wizards who misuse their magic.  <br />This alternate world's distrust of those who work magic along with the initial inability of the two races to speak a common language causes an uneasy alliance, and so the story and adventures go from there.  <br />One of the good points of this story is the lack of romantic entanglements in spite of the fact that two of the five younger characters are comely women.  The strong characterization of these characters makes it obvious that there'll be no fast blooming infatuations or love here, although I expect that will change in the middle book of the trilogy.<br />And so vivid characterization, deft plotting, underlying logic and unanswered questions make this a most enjoyable read with a quite satisfying ending, and yet a yearning to read more about Ile-rien.  Highly recommended fantasy adventure.	2003-06-24

If you strip it to the bones, you'll find a story of a woman falling in love with an enemy commander.  However, that would make it sound like a woman's book.  It's also about a man torn between duty as a military officer and his sense of honor as a human being, and that makes it a man's book.<br />As you'll see in the other reviews, this tells the story of Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan, eventual parents of Miles Vorkosigan who becomes the main character of the series.  However, this covers the beginning, before Miles.<br />It begins with the attack on an astronomical survey team which has the effect of most members fleeing off planet.  Cordelia Naismith and her botanist, who is attacked and left helpless and senseless, are captured by Aral Vorkosigan who's been abandoned by a group of mutineers.  Forced to trust each other to survive, they predictably fall in love, but their separate allegainces cause considerable complications.  There are space battles, political conflicts and bloodshed enough for the adventure fan and emotional situations enough for a romance fan.<br />It's told from Cordelia's viewpoint, but don't let that scare away any men.  There's plenty of action here, and there's intrigue.  There's keen insight into opposing viewpoints of conflict situations.  We're shown both the Betan perspective and the Barrayaran perspective, and we learn that the truth of a conflict lies between the two perspectives, not from one alone.<br />There's much more here.  I recommend you read it for yourself.	2003-06-20

This book rather makes up for the abrupt ending of the previous one in the series.  There is a hint that the author was burning out on the series, but I felt that he established a good stopping point with a promise of more to come, although future installments will undoubtedly be going on a new track.<br />There are shortcomings here, but I felt a stronger intensity which compensates for the shortcomings.  The primary characters are interesting enough for most of us to want to know more.  Pappy O'Neal, Cally, Mike especially are good, but I hope to also see more of Shari, Anne Elgars, Tom Sunday & Wendy also.<br />I don't down Ringo for cutting WHEN THE DEVIL DANCES short, and making a shorter book as an addendum to bring us to an intermission.  His writing reveals his own military background. 9/11 had to be especially traumatic for him and undoubtedly affected his whole thinking on the war situation.  <br />In this concluding volume, he gives us all the ground war action and description one could hope for while establishing the more personal threads in each character's life.<br />I do hope the wait for future volumes isn't too awfully long, and am quite interested in seeing how he shifts our attention more and more to the Darhel.  Contrary to one of the reviews, we were given hints in the first book that indeed, they are the true enemy.  And that's a story I will enjoy reading.	2003-06-18

However, these two novels and one novella provide a good and varied introduction.<br />CASTAGANDA, the first novel, is a light-hearted science-fiction/mystery with Miles and his cousin.  Humor, adventure, and intrigue combine for a delightful reading experience.<br />ETHAN OF ATHOS is a departure in that Miles is referred to but not in the story.  Homophobes may have trouble with it, because the title character is from an all-male planet based on a monastic type of life-style, a planet where women are forbidden and as a result of generations on a &quot;men only&quot; world are also mistrusted and misunderstood.<br />&quot;Labyrinth&quot; is a novella again featuring Miles in an adventure.<br />The common link here is the author's interest in synthetic birth.  This theme dates back to Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD, but here Bujold examines the subject from three different perspectives.  These are fun stories and quite recommended.	2003-06-16

The concept of an all male planet based on the idea of a monastary was well done.  The Athos prejudice against women was a bit on the strong side until you consider that, after all, the planet's residents had never seen women in their life.  To them, heterosexual sex would seem disgusting because they had no knowledge of it or of the female sex.  To be sure, Athos isn't a planet I would ever want to be even near to, but their attitude towards women would be as natural as our attitude is toward those who are totally alien to us.  <br />My disappointment with the latter part of the novel stems from my feeling of just plain tiring of the characters.  I would still recommend it to most science-fiction readers, but not as strongly as CETAGANDA.	2003-06-14

A lady friend of Paul's wants to know who killed her mother back in the 60's, and so Spenser collecting his fee consisting of six Krispy Kreme doughnuts digs into the past and comes up with more than his client wants to know.  In the meantime, he manages to disturb one of the ganglords who just happens to live in Paradise, and so he meets the police chief, Jesse Stone.

This was the easiest to find immediately, but now I'm told I would've enjoyed it more if I had read the earlier books first.  <br />Could be, but I did enjoy this immensely.  It had enough adventure, enough of a puzzle, and enough humor to make it one of the most enjoyable science-fiction books I've read recently.  Although there's definitely some science in it, it's not what I think of as \\"hard\\" science-fiction.  The characters don't get carried away with long technical dissertations, and I like it for that.  <br />Miles and his cousin are on a routine diplomatic visit to the adversary planet of Cetaganda and are immediately confronted with what appears to be a murder attempt upon them.  Further events indicate that they are being set up in an elaborate plot that will result in hostilities between their world and Cetaganda.  <br />Miles is, at my first glance, a notable character.  He doesn't have the looks to be a great romancer, though that doesn't keep his imagination from running free with possibilities.  He has a knack for continually stepping into trouble and yet reasoning himself out of it.  <br />This is indeed among the most enjoyable recent science-fiction I've read.	2003-06-13

S. book report, yet good enuff	Written at a High School level, this is a quite literate and well developed treatment of The Hulk, Spiderman, and The Black Cat in novel form.  It has all the action and story value of the comics.  For newcomers, there's enough exposition to introduce the characters, done briefly enough not to annoy old-timers well acquainted with the Marvel Universe.  <br />There's reasonable complexity here.  Neither the heroes nor the bad guys are completely working together since each has his or her own agenda.  Added to that is the S.A.F.E. agent working under cover representing government but not necessarily in the best interests of the heroes.  And so there are easily enough complications to keep a mature reader interested.<br />This isn't a bad book at all for those who want to get better acquainted with the not altogether jolly green giant before they see the movie.  Just bear in mind that the Hulk's creators made him a reasonable 7 footer as opposed to the 12 foot creature in the movie.  Note also that the character has developed in several ways over the years and so you might find his characterization in this book somewhat different than the movie characterization.  <br />Worth reading, even if you're way past High School age.	2003-06-13

Alert readers will figure out parts of these tales, but highly unlikely that they will untangle all the threads.<br />This is fascinating reading.  The stories each have relatively innocent beginnings.  A mental patient convinced that his brother, sister-in-law, and doctor are involved in his father's death and are plotting against him; a father wanting to have his future son-in-law investigated; another father looking for his runaway daughter; these are Archer's clients.  However, each of these cases become much more complicated than at first appearance and each one leads to violent death.  The characters involved are true-to-life.

This is the first Archer novel I recall reading, and it is a good one.  The characters are each well fleshed out, and while the story ends with a couple of them facing rough challenges, there remains some hope.<br />It starts with a man's leaving a mental hospital and hiring Archer to find out who murdered his father.  The man appears paranoid, accusing his brother and sister-in-law and a local doctor of railroading him into the mental hospital and being implicated in his father's murder.  A somewhat dubious Archer follows up on the case, although he's been assaulted by his client.  Murder occurs, apparantly by his client, and Archer pursues a convoluted trail, untangling some of the knots in the stories he's told.

The emphasis is on the people, and the mystery is more of a framework than the meat.<br />The difficulty here, to me, is the absolutely fatalistic flavor of the book.  It's been mentioned that the mystery is obvious, and just maybe the author meant it to be in order to create the feeling of a tragic roll of events.<br />There's a literary feel here.  I do recommend it, but be warned that it is rather heavy, and it will make you think.	2003-06-05

The search for Earth continues without missing a beat and leads to a return to two planets familiar to those familiar with the Robot novels, Aurora and Solaria.  The mystery of the missing Solarians is solved.  Also, a major thread from PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION is continued here.<br />There's much less conflict between factions here, but the spacefarers do need to remain alert to possible treachery during their travels.  A new character appears, one which obviously Asimov had plans for in future novels.<br />There's a lot more philosophy in the later novels and much dialogue among the various characters as they voice their perception of events.<br />Asimov remains the consummate story teller and while he came back to this series with a perspective and a perception he lacked in earlier novels, we have not so much a new direction as a logical development as we learn more of the over all nature of Isaac Asimov's galazy.	2003-06-04

Isaac Asimov created, in his youth and from his brilliance, a future universe.  Then, as is so with all authors, he moved on to other projects, developing his philosophy and his story telling skills and also his sense of humor as his career continued.  Of his own, he really had no idea of returning to Foundation, but of course, readers wanted and began to demand more.  Finally, his publishers applied pressure, and the result was FOUNDATIONS EDGE, FOUNDATION AND EARTH, PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION, &amp; FORWARD THE FOUNDATION. <br />Just as the earlier &quot;novels&quot; were actually shorter stories strung together, FOUNDATIONS EDGE and FOUNDATION AND EARTH are two longer segments of the next step in his future history.  Much has happened during the thirty years to affect the author's philosophy, and these two books which represent the necessary trip back to the beginning of it all reflect changes in thinking and of course of advances in scientific knowledge.  <br />We see what is happening from two different viewpoints, the First Foundation viewpoint and the Second Foundation viewpoint.  Each has its flaws and one can see that the Second Empire will indeed be deeply flawed if either of the foundations has its way over the other.  <br />Humanity, however, is being guided by intelligence beyond that of Hari Seldon's plan, and those who have read PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION are quite aware of this.  FOUNDATION'S EDGE works to lead us in the direction of the true master plan.  <br />Read this book with an open mind, and do continue the thread by reading FOUNDATION AND EARTH before coming to concussions...er, conclusions...about it.	2003-06-03

Notable is the lack of physical action and the fact that you don't even notice this lack.<br />Actually, this isn't as much a group of three novels as it is seven shorter works.  They lead through a crucial part of Galactic history starting with the beginning of the First Foundation, the first predicted crises, and then the unpredicted emergence of The Mule which appears to throw Hari Seldon's psychohistory off course, up to the search for a Second Foundation, spurred by the political intrigue and power struggle Asimov handles so well.<br />If you've never read these stories, and if you appreciate expertly written science-fiction, you do owe it to yourself to read these.	2003-05-31

Of course this is science fiction  and quite notable science fiction at that.  But in the hands of Isaac Asimov, it's also a mystery although not in the style of the first three robot novels.  Somebody used a psychic probe on an Earthman, wiping out his memory, and dumped him in a small village on the planet, Florina.  The woman who takes charge of him and the village's townsman eventually team up as the man begins regaining memory, and all become embroiled in political machinations.  We're introduced to the planet Trantor, the center of the Galactic Empire.<br />While this is the last of the Empire trilogy written by Asimov, it's the earliest in the fictional time sequence, occuring in an era much later than that era covered in the Robot novels.  <br />This is an engaging, tightly written novel with twists which will keep the reader involved.	2003-05-29

Of course there's romance complete with complicating misunderstandings, and more importantly, there's the continual power struggle emphasized in the Empire and Foundation novels.  And there's some good old fashioned space opera action as the main characters search for the planet harboring a group of rebels.  This is classic science-fiction, but don't let that scare you away.  There's nothing stodgy about the good Dr. Asimov's story telling.	2003-05-29

Ah yes, this might not be the very best Asimov, but it is good reading and prepares the reader first for the three Empire novels and then the Foundation series.<br />This takes up 200 years after ROBOTS OF DAWN and Elijah Bailey is long dead.  However, R. Daneel Olivaw and Giscard continue and are actually the primary movers in this novel, although Gladia, a villainous descendent of hers, a descendent of Elijah's and a continuing villain from the earlier book are all important characters.  <br />There's a lot of rather philosophical dialog between the two robots which slows down the story quite a bit, as they ponder over the ramifications of the three robotic laws and come up the the zeroth law which will in time enable R. Daneel Olivaw to return in later books.<br />It helps explain how Earth's descendents gain the edge over the spacers in their expansion in the galaxy.  It also explains Earth's radioactivity which is referred to in later volumes.<br />This is straight science fiction without any of the mystery subplotting of the previous novels.  There are hints of the types of power struggle which permeate the following books.  Also, one must realize that this book and the preceding robot novel were written after the three Empire novels and the Foundation Trilogy.<br />All in all, a satisfying enough read best enjoyed when read in chronological sequence.	2003-05-23

It and the following book, ROBOTS AND EMPIRE, link the first two robot books with the Empire series and leads up to Foundation.<br />There are a couple of points easy to miss here.  First, psychohistory is first suggested by Dr. Fastolfe, and then advanced by the two robots.  Secondly, while there is a mystery involved here, the emphasis is on the future of space exploration and who is going to be in it.  The original pioneers into space have become spoiled by their reliance on their robots and no longer have the spirit of adventure necessary to continue further exploration, and yet they are fearful of the idea of generally despised Earth people colonizing planets.  <br />So much indeed is at stake here.  For full enjoyment, I suggest reading first the Susan Calvin stories and also &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; which are in Asimov's THE COMPLETE ROBOT, and then THE CAVES OF STEEL and THE NAKED SUN, the first two Elijah Bailey &amp; R. Daneel Olivaw novels.  And be prepared for this book to be more centered on mankind's future venturing into space than in the mystery element.	2003-05-19

This is an engrossing series, and admittedly, I'm new to military science fiction and do occasionally get a bit lost, especially with the number of minor characters.<br />In spite of that, I find it reasonably fast paced.  I have become increasingly involved through the series with the various characters, and I do emphasize that you should have read the first two volumes in the series before tackling this one.  <br />The story here takes up five years after the ending of GUST FRONT, and there is some emphasis on characters introduced in that second installment while we see less of some of the characters introduced in the first book, A HYMN BEFORE BATTLE.  For a military series, this seems quite logical to me, and definitely more realistic than it would've been if the first book's characters had been manipulated by the writer so that they are right in the most crucial areas.  <br />This book is indeed darker than the predecessers.  The better part of the world population has been wiped out, and humans are hanging on in several isolated areas.  It does appear that those in the Northern regions are likely to survive due to the Posleen aversion to cold.  <br />We do get a better look at the Posleen than we have in the previous books, and begin to realize that they are apparantly being manipulated as quite likely the humans also are.<br />The book does end on an obviously inconclusive note.  There is obviously more to come and I for one will be there to find out what's next.	2003-05-19

The first book deals with preliminary battles aimed at slowing down the dreaded Posleen before they land on Earth.  In this book, they indeed land on Earth and the armed forces battle them and also rather muddled military bureaucracy.  <br />The main characters are of course largely carry-overs from the first book:  Michael O'Neal, Duncan, Pappas, and others.  Some new characters are introduced including two or three that are only very briefly introduced but who will undoubtedly play much larger roles in the third book.  <br />Music is introduced in this book and specific music is recommended for both the fictional characters and for the reader to listen to while reading.  <br />Also noticeable in this installment is the author's use of dialogue.  Several times, a scene ends with a piece of dialog from one character and is followed by the same piece of dialog from another character's mouth in a very different scene.  Interesting technique.<br />The reader is credited with intelligence. In at least one instance, a couple of characters are mentioned, but not by name.  Yet, you do know of course who they are, and do realize that they undoubtedly will be more important characters in the next installment.<br />One more thing to notice here is that we get a better look at the enemy which was largely faceless in the first book and will probably become even more of the next book.<br />I'm inclined toward being a dove and not into military fiction, but this book is well written and kept me interested all the way through.  Those who really are into the military frame of mind should really love it.	2003-05-06

There is a feeling of hate mongering here.  The enemy is faceless until near the end of the book, a species with no redeeming quality or reason for existence.  However, this is escape fiction with the feeling of military reality.  Maybe a little too many cliches to make it hip and contemporary abound.  But for those who like the genre, military science-fiction, this is a rewarding read.<br />It's also a promising start to a series.  Our planet Earth is being used by powerful figures from other planets who appear to be our benefactors.  They give us the technology to use against a galactic horde which is conquering planet after planet and is planning on attacking Earth within five years.  In return, we start battling this enemy on other planets.<br />This is for war buffs, action buffs and those who appreciate a wry humor.  There's plenty of the typical bashing of military bureaucacy, and plenty of profanity to establish the toughness of the characters, but all in all, this is a book and a series that should fully satisfy war fans.	2003-04-30

However, it is necessary to know the background of the earlier book to thoroughly enjoy the second.<br />One difficulty I did have with both books is the multitude of characters.  So many are introduced and so few really have any importance to the story.  This however, is a minor flaw.<br />While there is a lot of biological background explored in this book, it's easier to take and intrudes less into the plot than it did in the first.  More emphasis is given to the human characters, especially the daughter who naturally is a focal point of interest.  <br />The mother becomes more fleshed out also.  Her \\"epiphany\\" adds interest.  The first book stressed her atheism, and therefore, her experience is very interesting, and does have its effect on the character and, in turn, her effect on the plotline.  The author deals with this subject in an objective manner so that the reader can accept it as something that does happen to some people or reject it as overactive imagination.<br />All in all, the two books together comprise one of the better science fiction works.	2003-04-26

I kept plodding through anyway, and as the ending became more involved with the individual character's fates, my interest level picked up again.<br />The concept is great, and the general plot, though somewhat predictable, makes it worth plodding through.  The concept of a retrovirus which causes miscarriage and a second pregnancy with a poor infant survival rate is chilling.  And this novel would have been much more of a thriller if we had been spared such thorough biological speculation.<br />However, the sequel was, in my humble opinion, quite a bit more readable and worth reading, so for that reason, I do recommend reading this one first.	2003-04-25

Daneel Olivaw, Book 1)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The true beginning of Asimov's future history	Some of the stories in THE COMPLETE ROBOT indicate the beginning of galactic civilization with the concept of hyperspace, but this novel shows the beginning of Earth's expansion into the galaxy.  <br />However, that is only one of the factors in this science fiction/mystery novel.  It works well on both levels.  I've seen some criticism of the mystery elements, but with careful reading, the seasoned mystery reader will spot the necessary clues leading to the conclusion.  <br />The basic plot involves New York City detective Elijah Bailey's teaming with R. Daneel Olivaw, a spacer android, to solve the murder of a prominent spacer scientist.  Earth's population is, as a whole, fearful of the growing use of robots.  There's a combination of distrust of the robots and fear of robots taking over even complex jobs on an overcrowded Earth, and the police detective himself resents having to work with a non-human.  Naturally, this changes in time as the two work together to solve the crime and as Bailey learns of the outer worlds' objective of inspiring Earth's participation in colonizing other worlds.  <br />As a whole, the story is well plotted and should encourage those new to Asimov to continue reading the robot series and then the Empire and Foundation books.	2003-04-25

THE NAKED SUN is the direct sequel and is extremely satisfying, thought be many to be better than the original.  Personally, I feel it failed a bit, especially as a mystery.  This is still superlative science-fiction writing.  <br />This time, Elijah needs to travel to another world, a traumatic challenge to one who's never been outside Earth's \\"caves of steel\\".  He is venturesome enough though to want to actually experience the open air and \\"naked sun\\" of another planet and this causes some conflict with android partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, who following the three laws of robots needs to protect the detective from harm.<br />Again, the mystery part of the story owes to the classic \\"locked room mystery\\" subgenre in that the murder is one which appears to be an \\"impossible\\" one.  Since the murder occured, though, there is only one apparant person who could possibly have committed it.  <br />The Solarians have through their history and their reliance on robots developed a physical aversion to each other, husbands and wives being the only ones who tolerate contact with each other, and Solarian science is working to develop artificial insemination so that even that contact will no longer be necessary.  <br />As the detective conducts his investigation, he becomes more involved with his belief that Earth must participate in colonization of other habitable worlds, and so this novel while telling its own story also develops the thread that eventually leads to the author's Empire and Foundation series.  I am not sure whether or not Isaac Asimov, at the time that he wrote this novel, had any idea of developing R. Daneel Olivaw into such a pivotal factor as he eventually becomes, but it seems to me that there are slight hints here of the robot's leaning more on his reasoning ability, in spite of the fact that robots are not supposed to have any reasoning ability.  <br />Again, after reading thisbook, I believe one will very much want to continue into Asimov's future history.	2003-04-25

Maybe it's because I'm an old f**t, but I think a lot of reviewers have missed a key theme of this book.<br />I'll quickly mention points made by others before I center in on the immortality &amp; &quot;meaning of life&quot; themes I've found here.<br />First, this is hard science fiction, but if like me you're no scientist, there is a way to read it and get the gist of the science without getting hopelessly confused.<br />Secondly, while the second half of the book is more serious with bad things happening, there's a playful perspective to the entire book that can be compared to fairy tales, or to &quot;Tom Swift&quot; solutions, or to glorious &quot;pulp&quot; science-fiction of the '30's and '40's.  This might put off some readers and charm others. <br />However you react to the hard science and/or the allusions to <BR>more faniful genres, don't overlook what is being said about immortality.<br />The novel's protagonist and antagonist are both among the first to embark into immortal life and are reacting to such a life's implications.  As if immortality isn't enough to deal with, there's also the faxing of people creating copies of individuals who have the memories and personalities of the originals but go into divergent paths.<br />The principal character, after a long period of being the Queen's &quot;Philander&quot;, has become a hermit buried in endless scientific research which will hopefully enable him to see the end of time.  His opposite number, also for a time the Queen's &quot;Philander&quot;, has a similar goal, but due to his immortality has become what could be thought of as a souless entity, with little regard for humanity.  We're also given glimpses at other characters, each of whom attempt to deal with the prospect of immortality and the challenge to make unending life meaningful. <br />The question of God, of religion, or of lack of either is also looked at.  In fact, it seems to me that contemporary science-fiction as a whole is giving religionand its impact on society much more consideration than it once did.  Either that, or I'm noticing it more.<br />At any rate, if you bear in mind that this book does have a serious philosophical theme along with the &quot;technobabble&quot; and is framed in a pulpish, Tom Swiftian, fairy-tale like mold, you should find it well worth your time.	2003-04-17

Most of the stories are in a time period before CAVES OF STEEL.  One obvious exception is an Elijah Bailey &amp; R. Daneel Olivaw short which is a follow-up to the first two robot novels.  One story, &quot;Victory Unintentional&quot;, refers to the Terrestrian Empire, and others, especially some of the Susan Calvin stories, have to do with man's first expansion beyond our own Solar system.  <br />Thirdly, we're given a variety of levels of science-fiction writing.  We're told where the original stories were first published, and we see Asimov's versatility and ability to write for various markets.  Many come from Astounding/Analog, the magazine which published the hardest core science fiction.  A couple come from the Ziff-Davis magazines, AMAZING STORIES &amp; FANTASTIC which were soft-core s-f magazines.  A couple come from THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY &amp; SCIENCE-FICTION which had a more literary slant.  Several other classic s-f magazines are represented.  However, some stories come from non science-fiction magazines, such as SATURDAY EVENING POST and the Boy Scout magazine BOY'S LIFE, each carefully tailored for the market.  <br />As noted by others, the Susan Calvin stories are especially good.  They, along with a few other stories, appear to have been slightly revised for the sake of continuity.  In fact, I question whether or not Susan Calvin was originally mentioned in &quot;Robbie&quot;, Asimov's first robot story.  Somehow, I doubt it.<br />At any rate, this is easily one of the best collections of classic science-fiction as well as being just plain darn good reading that you'll find.	2003-04-15

There are those who thought the first section long and boooring, and I disagree.  I honestly wanted to know all I could about the principle figures, and author Laura Hillenbrand obliged.  The people she introduces to us are real, breathing, fleshed-out people with concerns and agendas we can understand, thanks to her detailed expositions.  We can see the extravagant extrovert entrepeneur Charles Howard who becomes Seabiscuit's owner, the quiet, non-smiling trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper should be great in the role), the tough but literate jockey who has a life filled with his share of misery ahead, and above all, the unlikely horse who captured the public's imagination and inspired more columns of newsprint in 1938 than did Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, or Mussolini.<br />We get an understanding of the times, still depression-era with clouds of war gathering, and why a hero to ease the extreme stress of the time was necessary.  We learn much of the unpretty side of the lives lived by the jockeys.  We get the flavor of bordertown Tiajuana in the days of U.S. prohibition and anti-gambling legislation.  <br />But the absolute highlights for me were Ms. Hillenbrand's colorful race descriptions.  I was able to picture the running of each important race and these descriptions were suspenseful.  In fact, Laura Hillenbrand's ability to keep the reader on the edge of one's seat is a welcome treat in non-fiction.<br />Now if you're just not at all interested in horses or horse racing, you're probably not even reading this, and if you are, I'd suggest getting the book from the library.  But for the average person who has even the mildest interest in the topic, this is abolutely a rewarding read.	2003-04-11

As this series continues, this novel may well portray crucial developments in Stone's life and career, but it fails to satisfy as a crime novel.  <br />Jesse Stone faced a home-grown militia group in his debut novel, followed by a group of cold-blooded criminals pulling off a spectacular robbery in the second.  So the murder of a 14 year old girl who's been disowned by her parents due to promiscuous behavior seems rather pedestrian in comparison.<br />Indeed, the girl Billie's parents, her former boy friend, and her high school principal have little interest.  Unfortunately, Parker doesn't seem terribly interested either since we really don't get to know the girl.<br />However, the focus on Stone's drinking may be a crucial development in the series.  Other people's problem drinking is involved in two incidental plotlines, and, along with Jenn's encouragement, may be what it takes to drive Jesse to accept counciling for his own problem.<br />There are a couple of other developments.  After Gino Fish and Vinnie Morris appearing in the two previous books without actually meeting Stone, he meets them face to face for the first time.  <br />There's also development in the relationship between the Chief and his main assistant.  Spenser of course has Hawk, and Sunny Randall has her strong support.  Jesse Stone has--Suitcase Simpson?  Seems like he got shortchanged, but Suitcase does show promise.  He still has a bit to go, but under the Chief's tutelage, he might be a respectable police officer yet.  <br />I can't recommend this as a mystery, but do advise Parker fans to read it anyway because it does seem to be leading someplace.	2003-04-07

The fault doesn't lie at all in writing skills, but in sticking too closely to the Jane Eyre story.  There are differences.  The girl's home and school experiences are somewhat condensed so as to conform more to today's literary style.  <br />And the book comes quite to life in one scene where Jenna is drawn into the space simulation game which isn't quite parallel to the charade scene in Jane Eyre.  In fact, if the remainder of Jenna Starborn's story had been allowed to build more from that scene, it would've been a much better story.<br />As it is, this book is merely an oddity and an interesting, but failed, experiment. The gothic overtones fight too much with the futuristic setting. <br />I don't tell you not to read this, because there may well be those that will be suitably fascinated by the author's attempt.  However, I suspect that it holds only rarified interest value, and that you'd be better off reading the original, if you haven't, and also Ms. Shinn's other novels which sound as it they're more successful,	2003-04-07

Parker to come up with a new character, and judging from this first book, Jesse Stone could be a winner. He's certainly different from Spenser. While he shows some wit, he's of a darker and brooding nature, having messed up his professional and personal lives by hitting the bottle too heavily. In fact, he even goes to a job interview after drinking and surprisingly gets hired as police chief in Paradise, Mass. He figures that he was hired in spite of his condition when the truth is he was hired because of his drinking...he appeared to be far easier managed than he turned out to be.<br />Obviously, Parker intends to have the two series interrelate to a degree. Vinnie Morris and Gino Fish appear in the story, although interestingly, they never interrelate with Stone. Somehow, I suspect that might change in future novels.<br />All in all, this is a promising beginning for a new Parker hero.	2003-04-07

My main interest in this was the fact that the forthcoming movie with Naomi Watts sounded possibly promising.  After reading the book, I might go to see the movie anyway, since a good screenplay and good portrayals might sharpen up the good points of the book.<br />My first thought was that there's a phony sophistication here.  There are good attempts to portray France as seen by a young American woman, and to portray Americans as the French see them.  <br />Both the American and the French perspectives seem superficial.  Maybe they're supposed to be.  Maybe that's one of the points of the novel.  <br />Some women's novels are good reading for us guys because they give an insight into feminine thinking.  However, to me, the women in the book were shallow and the men more so.  <br />The book did seem more than rather tedious for much of the early and middle parts, and only past the 2/3 point became interesting.<BR>In summation, it seemed to me that it was a manipulative novel about a batch of manipulative people.<br />On the other hand, I may be a mere man who lacks understanding of the women portrayed here.	2003-04-07

I gather this is required reading at a lot of high schools these days, and I'm sure that a lot of today's high schoolers do indeed think of it as a drag.  It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.<br />To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.<br />The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.<br />Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.<br />There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era.  There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it.  It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.<br />It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE.  The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story.	2003-04-07

Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this.  If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.<br />Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values.  As such, it's not really a book for guys.  On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.  <br />It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all.	2003-04-04

This concluding novel in the Engines Of Light series just doesn't quite stand on it's own meriets, but should be read as the last part of the series.  <br />This is definitely &quot;hard&quot; science-fiction, and therefore slow reading at times.  But the concepts here are fascinating as such themes as flying saucers and alien abductions are woven together with the intermingling of life forms in a future interplanetary society.  Quite highly recommended.	2003-04-03

It follows three primary characters over a century as they are part of the effort to study Halley's comet.  They discover a primitive life-form which attatches itself to the humans in a symbiotic relationship and eventually causes them to be an imagined threat to Earth.<br />The theme of genetically enhanced humans (Percells) and the rivalry between them and the normal humans is explored.  Some consider this an overworked theme, but the authors here approach it from a logical perspective.  <br />This is a good read and quite recommended for science-fiction readers.	2003-04-03

For me, it was between 80 and a 100 pages before I was at the point of continually being drawn back to the book.  I think this was the point where I started realizing and appreciating the mythic quality of the story.<br />As Inman makes his painful journey, he meets many people, each of which have a story to tell.  In the alternate chapters following Ada and Ruby, there are flashbacks.  Through the stories and the flashbacks, one gets more and more of the feel of the times.  This certainly isn't the glamorized South being depicted.<br />For those reading this book during the Iraqui war, there is much to think about.  Times haven't changed all that much.  Apparantly, there were those who felt that the war was being fought for economic reasons, not for moral reasons.  <br />This is no fast read.  Rather, it is a book to spend a bit of time with.  There's a bit of fancy in it which contrasts with stark and brutal reality.  <br />It's being made into a movie, and it is quite obvious that the producers are looking for a chance to win some Oscars.  You don't take a best-selling civil war novel, hire an academy award winning director and acting talent like Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweiger & Jude Law, then set it to open Christmas Day if you're not thinking Oscar.  However, the screenwriter has a challenge ahead of him, and if he turns out a script that is reasonably true to the book and yet satisfying as a movie, he will definitely deserve an Oscar.<br />So the question is should you who are reading my review read this book?  Very difficult question.  It's not a real easy book.  It's not packed with adventure, though there is adventure in it.  It may have too much romance in it if you're looking for adventure, and too much adventure in it if you're looking for romance.  <br />However, if you are patient and don't come to the book with a lot of expectations but just allow it to work on you, I would say give it a try.  If you like it, you'll probably consider it one of the best you've read.  And if you don't like it...well, put it aside and give it another try in a year or so.	2003-03-27

This is the second of Parker's new series, and Jesse Stone is being well developed.  He definitely isn't a Spenser clone.  He's more serious and more fallible. Actually, he's more human and easier to identify with.<br />This particular book pits him against a gang of five, two of which are indeed formidable, along with a woman who's formidable because of her love for one of the bad guys.  The 3rd person narrative allows us to get a better picture of the bad guys and exactly what they're doing than we get in Spenser's 1st person narratives. <br />Jesse Stone isn't as fast with the wise cracks and snappy dialogue as Spenser is, but the two main crooks give us a lot of snappy dialogue.  In fact, one restaurant conversation between Macklin and Crow could've easily been between Spenser and Hawk.<br />Lots to notice in the book.  Jenn is going to a Cambridge shrink.  Could that shrink be somebody we Spenser fans know well?  A base of characters is being built up here, and I'm sure we'll see some of them in future books.  Tony Marcus shows up, but notice that Stone doesn't meet him, so they're unaware of each other.  A lot of readers are concerned about Sloan's drinking and his sex habits.  It seems to me that he's not truly an alcoholic and is keeping his drinking under control.  As far as whether he's practicing safe sex or not...well, Parker doesn't really tell us whether he's taking precautions or not.  <br />Important thing is that this is a fun read.  The short chapters are hooks though...like salted peanuts, one always needs one more.  And I disagree with anyone who implies these books are quickly forgotten.  I'm surprised when I come across references to the previous book as to how much I do remember.  <br />If Parker is indeed easing Spenser out the door, Sloan may well be the more interesting of Parker's new series heroes.	2003-03-27

Maybe Parker realizes that also, and is using the dog Pearl's aging as a plot device hinting that time is catching up with all the characters.  Yeah, Spenser must be about 70...Hawk too, and Susan not far behind.  Quirk and Belsen must be ready to retire from the police department, and is that a transistor radio Vinnie Morris is always listening to, or a hearing aid?  <br />Still this isn't a bad book and spending two or three hours with it is more enjoyable than most of what you'll find on TV.  <br />Maybe some of Spenser's readers are tiring also.  I saw a couple of reviews written by those who seemed to have lost out on who killed Nathan, and others who didn't see the significance of Susan's client who commits suicide compared to the possibility of Nathan's suicide, or her feeling of failure because of her client's suicide compared to Spenser's failure to protect a character who came to him for protection.  All of the above shows that Parker hasn't lost it yet, but I fear he's tiring.<br />This Spenser book does have a surplus of characters, even after a larger than usual number of them get killed.  <br />So what am I saying?  I'm saying that this is a must for Spenser addicts, but only because it is Spenser.  However, it is rather pedestrian and it may be that your strongest emotion in reading the book is regret that Pearl is indeed getting pretty old.	2003-03-20

I was glad to follow Perrin and Matt and learn more of them.  Each of the three major characters is fascinating and this third book does reward the reader for following through the first two books.  The manipulations of the Aes Sedai do become more complex, and the conflicts between the ajahs are well developed.  <br />I might groan a bit at the thought of seven more novels published with the promise, or is it a threat, of at least two more to come.  However, so far, so good.	2003-03-20

But I find the three of them consistently good.<br />SHRINK RAP does differ somewhat from your basic Parker story.  It's one of the few that doesn't bring in organized crime figures.  The principle bad guy is believingly creepy enough that he doesn't need gangster help.  He does have a couple of confederates, and again, they are sleazy enough, and somehow more menacing than any of Joe Broz' or Tony Morris' hoods.  <br />As others point out, the disguise element doesn't convince.  This evil character sure isn't going to be convinced by Sunny's disguise, and I'm afraid I'm not either.<br />However, this book delivers what one expects from Parker...a quick entertaining straight-line read which while mainly diversion still has enough thought provoking elements to satisfy the intelligent reader.	2003-03-19

I liked it better than the first book, myself, because of the increased political and theological speculation.  <br />Especially fascinating is MacLeod's concept of the Gods and their relationship with humanity.  Not highly recommended to extreme conservative religionists.  <br />I did find myself mired down a couple of times in the political dissertations.  However, MacLeod basically tells a good story.  How good a story it is depends, I suppose, on the concluding book in the series.  But these first two are interesting enough and I'm getting to better like the characters, and so I will be reading the final installment.	2003-03-11

Some readers though make too much of the similarities between her and Spenser.  There are definite differences that some seem to miss.  <br />She definitely a woman.  There's one scene where she's investigating the murdered man's apartment and notes that he hadn't done a good job of cleaning the bathroom fixtures.  I doubt that Spenser would've particularly noticed that.<br />There's a difference also in her confidence level.  She rightly doesn't have Spenser's confidence when it comes to physical confrontation although that might change in time with enough visits to the gym with Spike.  <br />And while there are partial counterparts to characters in the Spenser series, they are only partial.  Spike isn't Hawk.  Nor is Richie.  Richie isn't a male Susan either.  Julie isn't Susan Silverman.<br />Parker is good in his use of characters we know from the Spenser series in this series.  We see a different side of Tony Marcus than Spenser sees.  Lee Farrell appears in this, and Spenser fans should get a laugh out of one scene in this book...an encounter between Farrell and Sunny's client while Sunny's watching.  We get a laugh because we know more about Farrell than either Sunny or the militant feminist client.<br />Don't expect a truly satisfying ending.  Some will find it weak, but I think Parker knew what he was doing.  This type of ending does make a person think.<br />I did have mixed reactions to this book, but it is enjoyable and if you like Parker, you should enjoy this.	2003-03-11

The roundup of characters from previous books gives me the idea.  And a strong similarity between this and the previous Spenser book seems like a bit of lazy writing.  My reaction when I realized where the plot was going was a resigned, &quot;What, again?&quot;<br />Spenser's hired to find the killer of a young woman's husband, but it's been established by her and the sherrif that the killer must be one of a gang headed by &quot;The Preacher&quot;.  After a bit of investigation, Spenser isn't so sure that the gang is responsible, but figuring the town would be far better without it agrees to being hired also to get rid of the gang.  But he realizes that he alone or even with Hawk's help doesn't stand much of a chance against a gang of 40, so he enlists characters from the previous books.<br />All in all, this is fun, but I personally have the feeling that author Parker and character Spenser are both tiring of the series.	2003-03-05

Yes, there's similarity to Parker's \\"Early Autumn\\" in that the detective sort of adopts a teenager who's aimlessly floating around, and yes, bits of the dialogue are identical to Spenser dialogue, but that's not really sufficient to take away from the enjoyment of this book.  <br />Sunny isn't really a female Spenser.  She's less comfortable dealing with the gangster connections than Spenser is.  While she's a good shot, she doesn't seem to be a true physical match for the bad guys.<br />In this first outing, she's hired to find a missing 15 year old daughter, but on finding her also discovers that she'll be in considerable danger if she's returned to her family.  The story goes on from there.  We meet Tony Marcus who we know from Spenser books.  And a flip remark is made at one point which indicates that Sunny knows of Spenser and his reputation. <br />Parker likes to throw in little teasers.  When we realize that the girl and her mother will each likely be visiting psychologists, we can't help wondering if one of them won't end up with that lady counsellor we know so well.  After all, this is set in Boston.   <br />There's bound to be a bit of a tie-in with other Parker series and therefore, I recommend reading all Parker stories in sequence.	2003-03-05

I've looked over both rave reviews &amp; hate reviews before starting mine.  Personally, I feel that the series hits a good stride here.  The first book was a better than adequate introduction to the characters and the basic story line.  Now, this second book takes us deeper into the mythology and develops some of the minor characters from the first book along with a few new ones.<br />I enjoyed this one better.  While the middle of the first book subjected us to a long trek with repetitious happenings and dreams along the way, the middle of this one keeps going with the differently developing threads between the female characters and the males on the hunt.  <br />The ending did make me hungrier for the next book in the series.	2003-03-05

Yeah, I guess this is a generation X novel, but I'm well beyond that and I still got one tremendous kick out of it.  <br />This is good free-wheeling satire, a good-natured poke at marketing and consumerism.<br />It's a fast, easy read following our hero, Scat, who has a million dollar idea only for it to be stolen by his trusted room mate, Sneaky Pete.  Falling in love with self-proclaimed lesbian, 6, Scat has her help as the two play the corporate games for their profit and our fun.<br />I read Barry's second novel, JENNIFER GOVERNMENT, first and liked it so much, I went on and read this earlier novel.

I'll mention them though, just to get them out of the way:  I found the beginning a bit rough, keeping track of a lot of characters all introduced at the same time.  And there were occasional repetitions noticeable, and rather awkward foreshadowing.<br />These are each very minor flaws though, and don't interfere with a thoroughly enjoyable read.<br />Plotwise, we have a private company in the 23rd century building a spaceshp and ferrying 6,000 very rich people from a dying Earth to their new planet, Greentrees.  These 6000 represent quite diverse groups and ideologies.  There's a tribe of Cheyennes wanting to take up a traditional mode of life; 1000 Chinese and 1000 New Quakers each seeking separate ways of leading simpler and quieter lifestyles; a major charcter's extended family of ecologically obsessed scientists; a deposed Arabic royal family, along with a few other various assorted rich & eccentric individuals.<br />The challenges and difficulties of setting up a world with such large and diversified groups is well handled by the author.  Further complication ensue with the discovery of aliens already living in villages and with the approach of a spaceship bearing a very different species approaching.<br />The core of the novel and its primary fascination come from the parts where humans and aliens work to avoid mistakes like those made on first contact.  However, the stories & agendas of the various characters are also fascinating.  At times, one might fear trite & ho-hum subplots such as the friction between the New Quaker doctor and his rebellious daughter, or the Corporation leader with a deep dark secret in his past, and yet we feel deeply enough for those involved that we are concerned with how each works out his and her challenges.<br />Having been away from science- reading for a long while, disenchanted with the depressing view of the future and the emphasis on hard science prevalent in the genre, I found this to be a refreshing, enjoyable return.	2003-03-01

Important thing is whether the book is an enjoyable experience or not.<br />My first experiences with Robert Jordan were his Conan books which I read along with Robert E. Howard's, L. Sprague DeCamp's, etc.  Therefore, when I tackled this first of a series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of originality.  <br />What I did find was a lot of rich detail and possible foreshadowing of the importance of various characters in later volumes.  If original plot is more important to you than detailed descriptions and mood setting, this won't be a book for you.<br />If you're good at speedreading and/or skimming, you will want to go quickly through Rand's travels through the villages and the repetitious events in them.  However, there are characters and events which sound as if they'll be important eventually.  The girl who shares her prophetic glimpses with Rand has a short role in this initial book, but I much expect her to reappear in later books.  The same with the heir-apparant and her brother both of whom Rand meets in a royal garden.  <br />I enjoyed also the hints about other characters...the rather sinister peddlar, the enigmatic gleeman, the boatman.<br />The book will have the most appeal to those who haven't read a number of fantasy-adventures yet and also to those who just plain enjoy a richly detailed story, even if it may bear a lot of similarity to others.  <br />In short, this is for the less sophisticated and less critical fantasy lover who enjoys richly embroidered quest books.  For others, it will seem overly long and not worth the effort.	2003-02-27

Gregory Benford is good for this, and he is capable, as in &quot;Timescape&quot;, of writing a good story embodying the science.  <br />For me, &quot;Artifact&quot; just does not fill the bill.  I honestly had the impression that he was trying his darndest to write something that could possibly be turned into a movie.<br />The heroine is a typical educated woman trying to prove herself professionally, faced with a military type adversary who wants to bed her.  She enlists a conveniently weaker though intellectually capable guy to help her smuggle a mysterious object out of Greece into the U. S.  Naturally, the object turns out to be a scientific oddity with sinister capabilities.<br />I'm not one to say that you won't enjoy this quite long novel.

Doesn't mean you will though, so I'll try to tell you enough so that you'll know whether it's for you or not.<br />First, it is a fast &amp; easy read like a Spenser novel, so if you read it and don't like it, you won't have wasted a lot of time.<br />Secondly, with all respect to the author, I feel he wrote this for fun and didn't really work hard to craft it, and since he made it as much fun to read for many of us as he had writing, that's quite okay.  <br />Thirdly, writing it for fun, I doubt that he means this to have a serious message.  He conceived of a society in which free enterprise goes completely wild and went on from there to present us with individuals trying to survive in this society.<br />Admittedly, I had the feeling that these characters were cardboard characters, and yet there were moments that moved me such as Hayley McDonald's fate, and its effect on Buy Mitsui who plays an unwitting hand in it.  Also affecting to me was John Nike's punishment.  Unlike another reviewer, I feel that he received the ultimate punishment for the person he was. <br />If you're willing to suspend disbelief for a few hours in order to enjoy a fast and funny roller coaster ride, I heartily recommend this.	2003-02-27

Parker to come up with a new character, and judging from this first book, Jesse Stone could be a winner.  He's certainly different from Spenser.  While he shows some wit, he's of a darker and brooding nature, having messed up his professional and personal lives by hitting the bottle too heavily.  In fact, he even goes to a job interview after drinking and surprisingly gets hired as police chief in Paradise, Mass.  He figures that he was hired in spite of his condition when the truth is he was hired because of his drinking...he appeared to be far easier managed than he turned out to be.<br />Obviously, Parker intends to have the two series interrelate to a degree.  Vinnie Morris and Gino Fish appear in the story, although interestingly, they never interrelate with Stone.  Somehow, I suspect that might change in future novels.<br />Like the Spenser novels, this is a fast and easy read.

Of late, though, Parker has introduced detective Farrell, a gay, and in this installment, he examines attitudes toward the gay life style.  One problem, though, and this is talked out in the book, is the fact that the majority of people Spenser meets are shady in one way or another, be they of a different ethnic background, or sexual preferance, or whatever.  <br />We do learn of an incident in Hawk's background along with a little more information as we meet his mentor and the mentor's son.  <br />Spenser actually is working two cases here, both pro bono, one for Hawk and the other for Susan.  There's irony here.  In a previous book, Spenser tried to help her ex-husband, and now for one of her friends.  Both times, Susan finds herself betrayed by those she thought she knew.  <br />By the way, I notice more and more criticism lately of Susan Silverman's presence in the books.  But she is an essential character.  Spenser has a code of ethics and there are times that he feels he has to violate that code in order to do the right thing.  This causes enough turmoil that, let's face it, the guy needs a shrink, but is very unlikely to seek one out.  His falling in love with one neatly solves the problem.  Hence, Susan.  <br />So the story has some failings, but basically should give you four or five enjoyable hours while you read it.	2003-02-26

Reading the jacket, I thought that hey, Parker is going to see what he can do with Spenser in a Dick Francis type story.  I shoulda known better.  <br />The race horse element in this book is strictly peripheral to a rather tired and typical Spenser storyline.  Even Spenser himself sounds like he's getting tired of the series.  When he's let go early in the book, he actually says okay, goes home, takes a ho-hum case and is ready to forget all about the job he was first hired to do, until he's hired by another of those involved.  When he goes back, those he wants to question refuse to talk to him, and be darned if he doesn't accept that. Hey, this isn't the Spenser we've known and loved!<br />I'm not going to tell you not to read this book.  If you're a Spenser addict like me, you'll read it anyway.  However, this book convinced me that it's time for me to investigate his two new series.	2003-02-26

Somehow, I feel a batch of people have missed the point here.  This is a pivotal novel, one in which Susan has to face some things she would prefer not to.  <br />Susan's ex-husband comes to her for help.  Of course, she doesn't understand the kind of help he's looking for and her misunderstanding involves Spenser and eventually turns up a batch of stuff that the ex is involved in.  <br />Human emotions are dealt with here, and it's revealing to watch Susan as she begins to realize some of her own hang-ups.  As far as the mystery goes, there isn't great mystery here.  We learn what's going on at the same time that Spenser does and much of it isn't a surprise.  Parker does telegraph much of the time and I believe this to be purposeful. <br />More and more, in these later Spenser stories, Parker does something unexpected.  This time, it's the ending which is unusually abrupt.  There's reason here, and Parker does know exactly what he is doing in the way he's crafting these stories.	2003-02-25

In fact I'd suggest going to &quot;The Godwulf Manuscript&quot; at the very beginning of the series.<br />Be that as it may, it is a rewarding read for those familiar with the characters.  Especially rewarding is the re-introduction of Cholla who we met briefly in &quot;Stardust&quot;.  <br />Parker varies his narrative style this time out.  The perspective switches back and forth between the victim Lisa, who's police detective Belson's young wife, and Spenser, so we can see when Spenser gets on the wrong track and when he gets back on the right one.  <br />This isn't quite the best Parker, but it's good and worth your while if you're a Spenser fan.	2003-02-24

Basically, Spenser is confident that he's going to be better than his adversary, and so when he is nearly killed by an expert, he needs to deal with his mortality.  <br />The ironic part of this is that he's working to find out if an absolute loser of a gangbanger is guilty of the murder he's accused of.  This novel poses questions both of mortality and of morality.  There's the question of how important is \\"The Truth\\".  Deals are made and those who end up in prison may be more worthwhile to society than those who don't.<br />This is a Spenser novel which, although a quick read, gives you ethical problems to ponder.  Very highly recommended.	2003-02-24

Former stories in the series have looked at the mindset of the ghetto gangs along with the more organized crime sydicates.  This one takes a hard look at the Chinese connection.  Parker as always successfully stays clear of stereotyped characters.  And as always, there's always a bit of sympathy...maybe empathy is a better word...for even the least likeable characters.  <br />Also, there is always the look at ethics and morality.  At the end of the book, you might well be asking yourself which character was the true villain or villainess of the piece.	2003-02-21

This one opens with a brief look at the gal we're supposed to care about in the prologue, but we don't see her again until we're near the halfway point, and by then it's easy to have forgotten those first two pages and not recognize her.  <br />Either way, Parker somehow fails to evoke caring for the gal.  He's succeeded before in getting us to care for characters we might not even like at first introduction, but not this time.  Therefore, this  being a fast read isn't that bad, but not that good either.  If you're into the Spenser series, do read this one, but don't expect a whole lot out of it.	2003-02-12

There's a brief reference to Vinnie, Joe Broz' long time hit man who left the mobster in a previous story.  Susan plays a lesser role this time, as does Hawk.  In Hawk's case, this is only fair since he carried the last book in the series.<br />All in all, this is a very good Spenser, but be prepared for the underlying tragedy of several lives here.	2003-02-03

After reading the first several stories, I started having the feeling that I was reading what Stephen King would write in response to assignments in a creative writing class, like &quot;Write a story about a man mistaken for dead in an autopsy room&quot;, or &quot;Write a story about a man being interrogated in a Central American country.&quot;  Then there's the story illustrated on the cover, &quot;Write a Grand Guignol slapstic comedy&quot;.<br />I don't really mean this as a put-down because many of these are worth reading.  I especially enjoyed the &quot;Write a story about a tired traveling salesman&quot; one, though I noticed some readers especially disliked that one.<br />The title story was my favorite.  I quite sympathized with the kid who thought he had a dream job until the reality of what he's doing crashes in on him.<br />All in all, this isn't representative of King's best short story writing, but it's good enough to please his biggest fans.	2003-01-31

And hey, Hawk is involved in a relationship too, as if trying to clear a housing project in the ghetto of a gang isn't enough.  <br />The romantic side plot this time takes up the question as to whether Spenser &amp; Susan should be living together or not.  <br />Especially good here is the portrayal of the attitude of the project residents and the activist preacher helping them towards Spencer.  Also good is the portrayal of the grudging mutual respect between Hawk and the gang leader.  On top of that, we're given an idea of how Hawk, in his own way, rose above his childhood beginnings.	2003-01-30

The combination of a coming-of-age plot in a science-fictional setting is interesting and workable.  The issues brought forth here are befitting both genres, those having to do with feeling and respect towards life, even life as remote from our experience as Aleph is shown.  And Aleph alone is a worthy concept, the idea of life that exists for no apparant reason than to survive, that has no interest in anything that doesn't sustain that life and being.<br />And of course, there is Benford's familiar theme, that of man attempting to bend all he encounters to his purposes.<br />There's some real meat here, but somehow, it just isn't clothed in a sustainedly entertaining mode.	2003-01-30

Here, you're dealing primarily with point shaving in college basketball, not with serial murderers.<br />However, as usual in a Spenser novel, there's more here than just the primary plot.  There's insight into racial relations, a theme that Parker explores deeper in the later PASTIME.  There's also the very human theme concerning dealing with a person who's abilities you admire, but who is an insufferable so-and-so.<br />It's a typical fast read and yet leaves you with a feeling that you've picked up something of value from the reading.	2003-01-30

I thought this was one of the best Spenser novels at the time of its publication, but I do recommend reading it in sequence.  Especially, read \\"A Savage Place\\" first, because the two books have a certain relation to each other.  <br />This is a bit more of a mystery than others in the series in that you don't discover the murderer's identity until the end, and this is good in adding a bit more suspense than usual.  <br />Spenser's hired to protect a very obnoxius TV star, who's addicted to drugs, alcoholic, arrogant...listed alphabetically, I'd be naming several other character defects before we get to nympho, and that's just past the middle of the alphabet!!!  On top of all this, she might be making up all these threats she's supposedly receiving.  However, when her double is murdered, Spenser has to take the task of protecting her more seriously.  He has a hang-up about protecting women since an unpleasant happening earlier in the series.  <br />I had a suspicion around half way through as to who the murderer was...I won't tell you whether I was right or wrong.  However, I believe the suspicion was deliberately & subtly planted by Parker, and if so, I admire him for the way he did it.  Like I say, I'll let you find out whether this was deliberate foreshadowing for dramatic effect, or a red herring to distract you.  <br />I do recommend this highly, but if you're not already a Spenser fan, read several earlier books including \\"The Savage Place\\" first in order to better appreciate this.	2003-01-30

That father-son relationship is also well explored. <br />Parker uses another element to add suspense. Susan has ended up with ex-husband's dog Pearl who accompanies Spenser and Paul. Well, we all know how high the animal mortality rate is in crime and suspense fiction, so dog lovers will be holding their breath everytime the dog goes out with Spenser. <br />All in all, a good and satisfying read.	2003-01-30

And the point lies in the human element and the very human part of the plot.  <br />There's continual contrast here between the characters on a dying earth and those in an earlier era.  The science-fictional theme is, obviously, time-travel or rather the communication through time.  <br />This is a book to be patient with.  It's necessary to accept the characters, not dismiss them as dull and uninteresting.  The characters are people like you and me who are facing their challenges in the best way they can, same as you and me.  These challenges placed against a cosmic type of fate therefore become significant.  <br />This book gives a deep look at life itself through the depiction and contrast of the working life where the characters in two different time periods are dealing with mind-boggling events on the one level and on the living of their personal lives on another.  <br />This book isn't for an action and adventure fan.  It's one which presents concepts that will stretch your mind, and at the same time show how everyday life complexities are part of the picture. <br />If you allow yourself to become absorbed in this book, you'll find much to think about, both on intellectual and on personal levels.  <br />I did have one fault with the book.  It begins in 1998, and I would have liked to see it end in 1998 showing the changes in the primary characters as well as the development of those who we meet in the 60's.	2003-01-30

Clarke.  A bit daunted by \\"hard\\" science-fiction, I found this book to be a relief.  <br />It's a fairly light hearted tale, but as it progresses, one does become fascinated with the characters.  <br />The story is narrated by a school teacher who is telling the story to a class of obviously advanced & bratty youngsters.  The story is often interrupted with comments & questions from the class.  One of the questions is which of the story's characters is the teacher, and I'm a bit shamed to admit that I was surprised by the answer which I realized too late was the only logical possibility.   <br />Basically, the plotline involves an eighteen-year old boy exiled from the planet on which he was born & raised, and given the mission to recruit another human who had previously resided on the same planet to hire a crew and track down & kill the mysterious \\"grayspace beast\\", a creature regarded by most as a myth.  There's great interplay among the various characters and a fast moving narrative.  <br />This isn't the most challenging science-fiction novel around, but it is indeed entertaining and recommended.	2003-01-06

Our hero isn't quite up to his usual quota of wisecracks.  <br />Secondly, some of the narrative is from the killer's viewpoint, a first for a Spenser novel.<br />Thirdly, there is a hint at the Harry Bosch type conflict between solving a case and playing police politics &amp; protecting the police image.  (This was written 4 years before the first of the Connolly series)<br />And fourth, there's a real testing of Spenser's relationship with Susan as there's a serious conflict between his need to protect her and her need for autonomy &amp; adherence to her profession's practice of condifentiality between doctor &amp; patient.<br />The reader might have a bit of trouble suspending disbelief over the points of Spenser's openly working with the Boston police and of the extreme coincidental factor, but it is an entertaining read up to the average Spenser.	2003-01-06

The answer to the above question should tell you whether this book is for you or not.<br />If you're here, reading this, because you were drawn by a feeling of lack in your life and a deep desire to bring meaning, order, and happiness into it, then I strongly urge you to seriously consider getting this book.  I don't guarantee that this book will give you all the answers you want.  No book will or can do that because the answers are in you, not in any outside source.<br />This is a powerfully written book that can stimulate your mind so that it's receptive to your inward awareness, that is if you will let it.  <br />However, there are many who say they are seeking happiness, but aren't willing to open themselves up for it.  Others are on a path which is already enriching them.  And of course there are those who block their minds against any possibility of spiritual awakening.  If you fall in any of those three categories, you're less likely to gain much value.  However, those on a path, even one which is fulfilling them, may well find good supplemental material here.  I, for instance, was especially impressed by a discussion in the second session.  Many of us have experienced a barrage of challenges shortly after we fitst start growing spiritually.  I've read several explanations of why this occurs, but the discussion in this book gave me a better understanding than I previously had.  <br />And so I give it four stars, realizing that there are many who just plain will not be receptive to the ideas here.  But for those who are receptive, this is indeed a five star book. <br />If you do decide to read this book, be fair and give it a full chance to benefit you.  The chapters are so arranged so that you can read and study one each week for a total of seven weeks.  Included with each chapter or session are suggested exercises and space where you can journal your thoughts and responses to each chapter.  Within these seven weeks, you will undoubtedly find that you have much more control over your life than you did at the beginning.  And so, even if you eventually decide that this is not the path you wish to pursue, you will have gained through studying the book. <br />While this book is meant to stand on its own, there will be four subsequent volumes.  Those who fully resonate with the teachings presented here have the opportunity for further study through audiotapes, seminars, and forming their own study groups.	2002-11-12

Anyway, this one has Spenser working for a man who suffered the horrible loss of his family and of the proper use of his body in a terrorist attack in England.  The job is to find each of the nine terrorists involved and bring them in, dead or alive.  The title comes from Spenser's plan to use one member of the group to catch the others and this does come about although in a somewhat unexpected manner.<br />The story has twists and turns enough to delight any mystery fan, along with the developing characters of Susan and Hawk.

This is the second Spenser book I've read, and it's definitely a home run.  <br />Spenser's hired to find out if the Boston Red Sox' leading pitcher is on the take or not, gets involved with a few nice folks and quite a few who aren't as nice.  The characters and their interplay with Spenser help make this a superior P. I. story.  The pitcher and his wife, the madame of a New York bordello, a flashy pimp, a flamboyant sports announcer and his bubblegum chewing martial arts expert assistant, an on-the-edge mob boss and his hit man, a knowing and not altogether unsympathetic cop, Brenda from the first novel, and Susan from the second each provide good scenes moving the story along.  <br />What lifts this novel above the average Spenser novel and the basic tough detective genre is Spenser's personal code, the set of principles that he lives by, and the struggle he faces when the only way to bring about a satisfactory resolution to the situation is to violate one of those principles.  <br />This is, on one hand, a fast, enjoyable read and also, on the other hand, a satisfying look at what makes the main character tick.<br />Very highly recommended to casual P. I. readers as well as serious ones.	2002-08-23

If one reads the first three chapters, one is quite likely hooked.  The whole trouble with Saul's writing is that once you're well hooked, you are likely to reach a point where you want to stop, but it is practically impossible.<br />The author really goes a bit over the edge this time, and during the last quarter of the book, I felt that he had gone too far in a downbeat plot development, too sad, too much of a real life nightmare some of us have.  However, by the ending, I was a bit more accepting of the worst developments in the story.<br />The ending does leave an opening for a sequel, but I don't expect to find one or that one will be written.  The open ending is good as it is because it causes one to speculate about what will happen in future generations.  <br />So the bottom line is that, because of good story telling, I will recommend it to those who understand that this is ultra strong and does have some darn unpleasant scenes and developments in it.	2002-08-19

A second extreme difficulty is the emphasis on children in so many of his books.  <br />However, if you start reading this book, chances are you'll finish it, even though you might not want to.  This one deals with every parent's nightmare, the loss of a child, and the author does a great job at digging into the guilt feelings of all involved in such an event.  And then comes the feeling of something wrong, too many coincidences as the bereaved mother's son exhibits strange abilities to heal, and also when his best friend, a strange boy with no other friends, mysteriously disappears. <br />This is skillful writing, but readers should be aware that this is strong stuff and that bad things to happen to good people, especially in John Saul's novels.	2002-08-19

I just recently returned to reading mysteries, and after reacquainting myself with Hammett &amp; Chandler, and being introduced to Michael Connelly, I naturally decided on checking out the Spenser books.  Like a couple of others here, I decided to start with the beginning.  <br />First, I quite enjoyed the character, although he, in this first novel, is a bit extreme &amp; non-discriminate in his skirt chasing.  I understand that mellows out later in the series. <br />His show of intelligence and of advanced education fascinated me.  This combined with the typical wise-cracking tough guy PI attitude makes Spenser (Note, everyone, his name is spelled with two S's) unique enough to continue following.<br />The mystery itself was less than challenging, but the main character and the taut writing kept me going.  <br />Definitely a worthwhile read.	2002-08-15

We search for meaning as we read the story of Marlow who is searching for meaning in his search for Kurtz...who, guess what, has been involved in his own search for meaning.  <br />Much is, or should be, obvious here.  Conrad is depicting the horror of colonization.  Some readers got lost here and thought he was defending colonization, but careful reading proves the opposite.  Racism is also crucified here, but some readers miss that.  The big difficulty is the prolific use of the word \\"nigger\\" which had a significantly different connotation in the time that Conrad wrote than it does now.  The connotation had changed drastically, and the reader should be aware of the difference between the 19th century English connotation and the 20th century American connotation.<br />The writing is deeply textured.  Conrad goes into exquisite detail and for those who flow into his description, the story becomes more absolutely real and intense. <br />This book is rewarding to those who have the patience.  It's a shame that it's required reading in high school.  Most high schoolers haven't had the living experiences that would help them understand the point of the story.	2002-08-15

Since then, I noticed, to my surprise, he had a following and was getting some good reviews, and so finally when I saw this book, was intrigued enough to get it.  I'm glad I did.<br />I started it during some free time on a Sunday afternoon and found myself finishing it a few hours later, mainly because I didn't find a point where I wanted to lay it down for more than a few minutes.  <br />I don't recommend it to somebody looking for a realistic thriller.  There are too many improbabilities and coincidences for anyone who is greatly bothered by such.  Also, I didn't find the ending quite satisfying. ....<br />And yet, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent reading this.  It did give a rather one-sided view of the homeless, but it didn't portray the \\"respectable\\" characters as being any more likeable, so taken as a fast paced thriller, a good read as long as you're not an extreme nitpicker.<br />Now that I've rediscovered Saul, I am planning on reading some of his other novels (though I doubt I'll ever reread his first ones}.  <br />You'll notice I don't say much about the plot.  You'll see that in other reviews and on the paperback version's back cover, but feel that the less you know about it before you start, the more you'll enjoy the development.	2002-08-14

Connelly justifies his reporter character by having him practically forced into being part of the investigation.  Jack McEvoy is indeed in a complicated situation in that he on one hand is a reporter right on top of an important story, and on the other hand, is one victim's brother and therefore motivated to do the right thing by his brother.<br />At one point, I suddenly didn't like him because he performed what I consider an inconscienable act for purposes of embellishing the story he'll eventually write; but he later has second thoughts and feelings and realizes the sorrow his action would cause, so that he replaces that which he took before the act is discovered.  This was an illustration of his struggle between being a top reporter and being a good brother.<br />The revelation of the Poet's identity threw me and disturbed me at first, but after analyzing it, I saw what he was saying.  However, the message was somehow garbled and that's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.  However, I do advise all readers to watch that ending carefully so that you catch the writer's intent.  Otherwise, you might like many of the reviewers think it a very unbelievable ending.<br />Finally, I warn more sensitive readers that this is indeed strong stuff.  We see a very disgusting killer's mind in operation, and it's not a pleasant view we get.	2002-08-13

Krishnamurti's writings, which actually come from his talks prepared for various audiences, and most of them are extremely good and enlightening.<br />However, this, his notebook, is a more direct view of his thoughts, being written down during one of his travels in a notebook.  These are personal revelations, written for his own purposes, and as such are quite instructive.  <br />We do once again encounter many of his concepts as revealed in his lectures, but here they are presented in a different context, as in a personal journal.  We get beautiful descriptions of his surroundings.  These musings are written in the third person in that he refers to himself as \\"one\\" rather than \\"I\\".  <br />This book will undoubtedly be of more value to those already familiar with his writings and with his talks than to those who haven't yet become acquainted with them.  It is a more direct glimpse into his thinking.<br />Very highly recommended to the spiritually inclined.	2002-08-13

My Friend	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Amazing rapport between a young girl and her &quot;best friend&quot;	I can't believe that nobody seems to have discovered this humorous and yet tender account of the life of P. J., the cat.  <br />The book's author who was first a journalist and then a novel writer decides that his pre-school daughter needs a pet, and decides that a cat would be less nuisance than a dog.  Stopping by a pet shop, he spends the princely sum of ninety-eight cents for a straggly waif of a kitten.  It's instant love for his daughter, Twink, and the book covers their life together over the cat's lifespan.  <br />The very core of this true story is in the almost mystical rapport between Twink and &quot;Prince Julius&quot;, who quickly becomes P. J.  Twink soon considers P. J. as her best friend, and so it is.  Other members of the family are friends, but only Twink and P. J. are best friends to each other.  <br />Through the various chapters, we learn first how the author somewhat reluctantly started considering P. J. a friend, and then P. J.'s encountering various changes including moving from a New York City apartment to a rural Connecticut area, wildlife, a growing feline population, and the author's second wife, a self-proclaimed cat hater.  Always, though, there is the relationship with Twink, P. J.'s best friend.  <br />The events are all told with a cat person's sense of humor, until the very touching final chapter.  <br />The book has definite appeal for parents as well as cat lovers.  However, younger readers from 12, or maybe even 9 up, should also enjoy it.	2002-08-09

I'm now part of a group which is actively studying the book a bit at a time and I can't believe all that there is here.  <br />The first thing to realize is that Chopra doesn't claim that he's going to present some great Truth to you.  You don't get the Truth from a book or another person.  You get it from yourself.  All that Chopra can do and hopes to do is to so stimulate you to find it yourself.  <br />The next thing to realize is that the seven stages that he presents are not necessarily progressive, but merely stages to identify with, presented so that you will recognize what stage you are at so that you will be in a better position to realize how to relate with God at that stage.  <br />And then, opening yourself up to what is presented rather than just reading this is important.  ...  Krishnamurti is one of several writers Chopra suggests that you read, as well as Hawking, Zukav, Yogananda, the Maharishi, Ken Wilber, among others (This is in the notes at the end of the book.  <br />Another says there's too much Biblical reference.  Most western readers are more familiar with the Bible than with any other writing considered by many to be \\"sacred\\".  You'll also find many Vedic references here.  <br />...  This isn't a book on physics, but on spirituality, so if his physics don't seem right to you, little is missed unless you center on points of disagreement. <br />...  One's mind can accept only a certain amount at a time, and if you overdo what you're taking in, you'll fall asleep or just lose attention.  <br />...<br />It's not necessary to agree on each point Chopra brings up to gain from this book.  Heck, it's not even necessary to agree with most of what he says.  It is necessary, if you truly wish to gain something useful from this book, to keep your mind open and let him state his case, because there are bound to be elements useful to you among those not so.  <br />The bottom line is that the non-resistant reader who takes this book slowly, re-reading when you miss a point, will be stimulated into his own personal search, and this is what Chopra intends.  Not to brainwash you.  But to get you to search within.<br />If you buy this book and are disappointed in your first reading, then put it aside, but where you'll notice it sometimes, then come back in a week, or a month, or a year, and let the person you've become in that period of time read it.	2002-08-09

Careful reading of Gary Simmons' book should help one understand the how and why of this conflict, and how to embrace, rather than resist, it and thus learn the effective way to deal with it.<br />This isn't Pollyana stuff.  The author teaches martial arts, and his teaching comes from strength, not from timidity and passiveness.  <br />For those who are super serious in their desire to deal effectively with conflict, I recommend buying the tape EMBRACE TIGER, RETURN TO MOUNTAIN, along with this book.

Here in the earlier stages of his life, one can see the elements that shaped the man and his philosophy.<br />Mary Luytens, the author of this biography, was a close friend of his and she refers to herself in the third person several times through the book.  Her mother was active in the Theosophical Society directed by Mrs. Besant during J. Krishnamurti's childhood and young adult years.<br />As the eighth son born to a family of the Brahmin caste in India, he was automatically given the name of Krishnamurti. A horoscope was immediately cast for him by an Indian astrologer, and needless to say, it predicted that he would be a singularly important spiritual influence.<br />This is a fascinating account of those early years, and of how the Theosophical Society gained control of his upbringing, and cast him in the role of the great world spiritual leader whose advent the society predicted.  The author details events of this period and the reader will see how Krishnamurti, although under the tutelage of this group, developed an independent spirit and an independent philosophy, and eventually stepped out of the role created for him.<br />The emphasis throughout the book is on the biographical events and not on the eventual philosophy.  For this reason, I feel that the person familiar with the philosophy will get more from this book than will one who hasn't read this man's writings.<br />I believe anyone who is spiritually attuned will gain a tremendous insight through this book.	2002-08-07

There's repetition here because the book is a collection of talks given by the author.  There's a series of three lectures given at Brandeis; four at Berkeley; four at Stanford, and one at Santa Cruz.  These are all aimed at college students.<br />Certain themes recur in each series, but these themes are reworded, given fresh perspective each times.  The central theme is one's relation to the entire world emphasizing that each person does have an impact upon the whole, and we are a part of the good and a part of the bad in the world.  <br />Another recurrant theme is the relationship between the observor and the observed, the goal being to reduce the space between the two until they are the same.  <br />Dreams are mentioned, as is meditation.  In each instance, Krishnamurti emphasizes that we must learn these things for ourselves.  Books, churches, different spiritual paths, each, according to the writer, is divisive.  <br />There is much here to think about and absorb.	2002-07-29

Having them all together in one volume is invaluable.  And reading these consecutively is hardly boring, because there's a world of difference between them.  <br />RED HARVEST featuring the Continental Op is a real romp through a completely corrupt town which gets what's coming to it because a corrupt police official makes the middle aged fat man protagonist mad.  There's an underlying theme of corruption as a true poison.<br />THE DAIN CURSE is again the Continental Op, and here you see glimpses of a tender side to a character who is basically completely self controlled.  And in this, you see the very weak female character turn into an admirably strong woman.<br />THE MALTESE FALCON is of course the true classic, a study of greed and deception.  Sam Spade's story of a character named Flitcraft gives the reader the author's perspective on the randomness of life.<br />THE GLASS KEY gives a sleazy view of politics and makes a couple of points about friendship.<br />THE THIN MAN appears lightweight after the first four, but a second reading reveals a portrait of a very able person who allowed passion to leave his life, and is slowly going down the drain.<br />Crime fans will especially love this collection, but there is a whole lot of value concerning human nature and the framework of society here.	2002-07-25

It tells the story of a guy who got a bad rap the first time around, and just a few weeks after getting out of jail, he finds himself in danger of going back.

Read it the first time for fun, but then reread it to see what you missed seeing the first time around.  <br />You probably know the basic plot.  A former private eye has given up on the detective work after his wife has inherited her father's businesses, and is running her financial affairs for her.  On vacation, they run into his former acquaintances and, of course, a mystery develops which he reluctantly is persuaded to investigate.  <br />There are a lot of undertones here.  The obvious fact is that both husband & wife are slipping into alcoholism, although he's ahead of her.  He has lost interest in what was once his very life.  He apparantly slips out on her on occasion, and she seems to tolerate it...they obviously love each other.  But he's not the man he once was.  He's going to avoid violent confrontations and he takes the easy way out.  His drinking habit, his unwillingness to exert himself in solving a crime, the fact that the only noticeable cheating on Nora is at a party where the other woman apparantly drags him off...all this indicates a once vital person such as Sam Spade or, to compare with another author's detective, Phillip Marlowe who is losing interest in life.<br />I wonder if this book didn't inspire Raymond Chandler's idea for POODLE SPRINGS which opens with Phillip Marlowe's having married a wealthy woman.  Chandler only wrote four chapters before his death and Robert Parker finished it, showing Marlowe as too rough hewn a character to settle into the wealthy life style.<br />But Nick Charles gave in to it, and maybe was worse off for doing so.  <br />This isn't the strongest of Hammett's books, but it sure is worth reading and wondering a bit about.	2002-07-25

Out of sheer love, love for people, she helped in hiding the Frank family along with a few others.  <br />The book tells the entire story of Miep Gies, from her first employment by Anne's father until the final liberation of Holland.  The story is told honestly and without a feeling of ego or of her deliberately sounding like the brave woman she was.  And it's told in such a way, that you feel a kind of suspense as if you didn't know of the tragedy coming.  <br />Miep is unrelenting in her portrayal of the grimness of life during the German occupation of Holland.  It was worse of all for the Jewish people, but it was also hard on the Dutch people.  Reading this is an education for those of us who have no idea of how it is to live in an occupied country.  <br />However, you feel the hope in the ending.

I hoped that the deeper delving into the subjects central to the man's philosophy would tell more than it did.  But instead, there seems to be more contradiction, and not nearly the clearness to be found in his other books.<br />Even so, this book definitely deserves three stars.  There's definitely that of value here.  It's just unfortunately disturbed.<br />Those who have become more immersed in Krishnamurti will without doubt find more of value here than those who have just discovered him.  <br />Definitely not a worthless book, just one to set aside until you know the author better through his other works.	2002-07-25

There's no shortage of churches and groups that will willingly take you in and instruct you in your thinking and doing.  And you will emerge thinking another person's thoughts, doing as another thinks you should do.<br />J. Krishnamurti is unique in his writings.  Sure, you will find a little inconsistency, and he will even admit to this.  He does not claim to know it all.  But he does know how to inspire one to search for that which is within and to do so indepently.<br />You will not find immediate answers in Krishnamurti's writing.  The answers are to be found in yourself.  But this book along with his others will give you the impetus.<br />And this is probably the best &quot;first&quot; book of his to read.	2002-07-23

While there is a dead body early in the story, this protagonist doesn't seem all that interested in who the murderer is until the pivotal scene when he gets severely beaten for not turning on his former friend who he's temporarily on the outs with.  <br />I've noticed this plot gimmick more than once in Hammett.  The rascally characters bring the protagonist's wrath upon them by needlessly attacking him.  That happened in one of the shorter Continental Op stories and then again in Red Harvest and now in this one.  One could put The Maltese Falcon in that class also.  <br />Personally, I had trouble liking the characters until that pivotal scene, and then only did I get involved with them.  So I do feel that this had the weakest opening of Hammett's major works.  However, once one gets through the first part, it becomes as riveting as any of Hammett's.<br />So I do very much recommend this one along with Hammett's other books.	2002-07-23

Personally, I found it easier to picture Howard Duff, who was radio's Sam Spade, while reading the book.  And the character of Wilmer is much younger than the henchman in the movie.  This particular fact sharpens the portrayal of Joe Cairo's homosexuality and makes it more evident than in the film.  <br />The book goes into further detail concerning Spade's affair with his late partner's wife and adds a \\"life goes on\\" twist in the last sentences of the book.  There's more of the secretary, Effie Klinker and more of Spade's encounters with the police.   Also, there is Gutman's young daughter, who wasn't in the movie. <br />Most importantly, though, the book gives the main character more rough edges, rounds him out a bit better.  And the book better fleshes out and portrays the greed of the characters and that greed's consequences. <br />Careful reading here will give you new insights into the story, and is quite recommended.	2002-07-23
US	46877221	R3PPPRPDZQNL0V	0679722610	645212410	Red Harvest	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Both superior crime novel and incisive social commentary	The Continental Op is, as far as I'm concerned, the most interesting of Dashell Hammett's characters.  He's a middle aged fat man employed by a national detective agency similar to Pinkerton (which Hammett worked for before turning to writing).  As such, he's nominally bound to rules which he generally follows, but breaks in this particular case.<br />His client is murdered before he meets him, and hired by the client's father to find the murderer, finds himself in a totally corrupt community basically run by the mob.  Though he easily finds the murderer, he stays on in the father's hire to clean up the town, spurred on by the actions of one of the corrupt law authorities.  <br />The story is engrossing, and the implications are even more so.  The corruption is so deep that it affects even the main character.  The theme common to most Contintinental Op stories is here:  Everybody lies and the only way to get at the truth is to create your own lie.  <br />Every tough crime story needs its love interest, and this one is very believable in that you can see why she is drawn to this middle aged fat man and why he can find her acceptable.  You also realize why he's withholding his feelings both from himself and from the reader.<br />While not Hammett's most read novel, it's definitely expertly crafted and one quite rewarding to read.	2002-07-22
US	46877221	REGUHFXPL4KSA	0679722602	753728238	The Dain Curse	Books	4	3	5	N	N	The last third makes the first two thirds worth reading	A little below standard for Dashell Hammett and for his Continental Op stories, the climactic last third represents some of the author's best writing.  <br />This was originally published as three consecutive stories in a pulp magazine, but you must be familiar with the first two in order to get the most out of the third.  And you don't know the whole truth about the first two until you finish the third.  This again is consistant with the Continental Op's relationship with the truth...the knowledge that you are basically given only lies and must concoct your own lie to find the truth.  <br />The primary female character is not very sympathetic for the most part until you get to the third episode when you realize why she seems so drab and uninteresting during the first two episodes.  <br />I would suggest reading other Hammett novels first, especially &quot;Red Harvest&quot; as an introduction to the Continental Op.  And while this may be the weakest of his novels, it is still superior crime fiction.	2002-07-22

Therefore, the use of the regional dialect may be a bit of a challenge to some young readers, but the exquisite illustrations should spur nine year olds & older to read it for themselves.  It should be stressed that this is a true story as all of Herriot's writing is based on his experiences as a country veterinarian.  <br />Do resist the temptation to skim through the book for the illustrations before reading it though.  The illustrations are definitely a part of the story and one of the double page illustrations will definitely get a better reaction if not seen until one reads the preceding text.  <br />If this \\"children's book\\" is left out on the coffee table, I predict that everyone in the family will at one time or another read it and enjoy it.  I'm sure that any teenagers will wait until nobody sees them reading it, and that they won't admit enjoying it, but chances are they will.  <br />Also, this book may well inspire those 12 and older to read James Herriot's adult books.	2002-07-18

However, if you've already read some of his thoughts, this is still a good book to read and re-read.<br />This collection is a compilation of talks given to groups of students and their teachers in India.  It is still of universal appeal and for all stages in life.  The occasional references to scenes and situations more familiar to his Indian audience than to us give a slight glimpse into this culture.  <br />The style of writing is simple and direct without patronizing <BR>the younger people in his audience.  There are questions from the audience in the last part of each chapter, and are quite penetrating.  <br />One sample of his directness is illustrated by a rather weighty question posed by one of the youngest members of the audience and the author's response which indicated his suspicion that one of the teachers gave the question to the student.  Another time, he directly tells the questioner that he wasn't listening to the talk.  One student asks a question which pits one of the professors against Krishnamurti, a question well handled by the author.<br />The reader must be prepared to expect basic thoughts, especialy those involving religion, nationalism, and patriotism, to be challenged.  However, these are challenges from one who is a friend, not from a guru or holy person.	2002-07-17

We are all familiar, I'm sure, with talk about the new generation of &quot;Twilight Children&quot;.  This takes the theory of current evolutionary advancements further and postulates that older generations, senior citizens in particular, are also partaking in this evolution.  The concept should be familiar to those who saw the movie COCOON.  However, this delves deeper into the spiritual evolution of mankind.  <br />All this is explained to us by some very likeable fictional characters such as Barbara, an 88 year old woman who is apparantly in her 60's going on 40 something.  The primary character, a painter in his mid 40's, is going through a spiritual crisis and is led to a group of seniors who explain to him what is happening in his life and guide him in dealing with it.  These particular seniors are definitely evolving and in doing so, have ceased to age.  Four select seniors are actually regressing in their ages, quite dramatically so.  We are told clearly how this is happening through eight attunements.<br />Now, as a novel, this book is somewhat lacking.  The plot, such as it is, takes second place to the philosophical treatises as to what is happening.  And there are specific practices, primarily breathing and drinking lots of purified or distilled water. Anyway, the plot is on the slight side.  However, the characters involved are likeable and believable.  <br />As a whole, this book reminds me of THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, but in my opinion it is much clearer in its concept.  The plot also is somewhat more engrossing than that in the better known book.  <br />The upshot is that if you are interested in, and want to learn more about, the possible evolutionary process that we are undergoing, youwill find this book quite engrossing and inspiring.  However, if you're looking for a good entertaining novel, you might want to look elsewhere.	2002-07-16

Simmons' message here is not at all of avoidance of conflict, but of dealing effectively with it by being truly centered.  There are lessons, so he states, for us to learn in conflict situations.  And such situations indeed are part of life.  But if we don't deal realistically and effectively with conflict, we bring even more disharmony into our lives.<br />And so we are to embrace the tiger, that is the conflict situation, and return to the mountain, that is to our center.  This takes a bit of spiritual training, a sharpening of our ability to center, to deal with situations in ways that are nonviolent, and nondestructive to ourselves or others.<br />This two hour program presents us with a regime and a way of thinking to accomplish this.  It is done with compassion and understanding, also with clarity.  <br />I very much recommend this to people at all levels.	2002-07-16

She gives a number of examples from her experience as housewife, career woman, and mother as to how to learn spiritual truths in the midst of the normal daily experiences.  There are no truly dramatic stories here, no tragedy and no hilarious humor (althugh there's plenty of gentle humor).  There's just a recounting here of a woman's life, a woman's concerns and how to relate to God or to a higher power in a busy life.  <br />Personally, I would've liked it if she had expanded a bit and recounted maybe some experiences that her husband had to show how he relates during a busy man's routine.  However, obviously, the author preferred keeping her dialogue on a &quot;between us women&quot; plane.  I have noticed a lot of that lately.  It's as if spiritual writers have decided that men don't read their books, so they don't even try to relate with any stray male readers.  I think that's kinda too bad, but so it is.  <br />I don't mean the above as a major set back though.  It's just fair for those of the male gender to be warned that this book isn't really aimed at all at a general audience, but to a female one.  And for the female audience, there are plenty of tips and examples for keeping in tune during the daily routines.	2002-07-16

Krishnamurti's 2nd book	I am reading these books in sequence so that I will be aware of any shifts in this philosophy as he progresses.  <br />The reading here is easy, but the thinking is more difficult.  Krishnamurti doesn't attempt to speak what people might want to hear, but speaks from his heart, from his innermost being.  So he doesn't give an easy path to follow nor does he promise such a path.  Actually, to provide a path for others to follow would contradict his philosophy.  <br />The answer according to him is in self-knowledge, but that knowledge can not be gained through effort.  Nor, says he, can it be passed on to you by a guru.  It won't be found in books.  (I can't help but be amused by those who emphasize that the Truth isn't revealed in the printed word, and of course they use the printed word to share this message with us.)<br />The first half of the book is comprised of writings and portions of talks.  The second half consists of questions asked after his talks, and in his answers you will find repetition sometimes as he clarifies.  He has a way of emphasizing the main points by asking  &quot;Is it not?&quot; or words to that effect.  <br />I admit to having difficulties with much of what he says, but this isn't criticism as much as a compliment.  The very difficulties I might have benefit me so so that I learn through resolving them.  If you don't get this book, do at least read some of his other material.  You will be rewarded.	2002-07-12

However, this book's influence goes beyond those who read it and are affected by it, because those people will hopefully be more consistent in behaving ethically, and this will influence many who don't read the book. <br />Again, this sort of criticism is typical of the type of thinking many have when listening to a sermon or spiritual talk:  &quot;Too bad so and so isn't hearing this!&quot;  Don't worry about the people not reading it.  Read it to get full benefit and allow it to influence your thinking and actions.  If you come across a stumbling block, a statement you disagree with, pass over it so that you don't miss more important points. <br />Of course, this book was written before the events of 9-11-01, and our perspective is bound to have changed since that awful day.  Hopefully though, we are still open to respect of political and religious differences.  This is the bottom line.  We are to use our ability to love so that it extends to all people, even to those who belong to nations who are on bad terms with us.  <br />If you read this book just as a book as philosophy, it will have failed in it's purpose.  But if you take the core message to heart and allow yourself to be spurred to resolve and action, it will have succeeded.  <br />Any normal reader will find little loopholes, areas of disagreement, but centering on the larger picture will be more effective by far.  Introspection and self examination followed by self discipline are called for along with reaching out to others with love.	2002-07-12

By the way, this is indeed an attractive coffee table book with its colorful cat pictures and tidbits of information.  However, it is a good book to have on hand for the information in it.<br />Although it's written by a veterinarian, this isn't really a cat care book.  Oh, it does have a number of cat care tips, but the focus is on understanding your cat.  Naturally, the information here is in the form of generalities, and any cat owner knows that your individual cat might not follow all of those generalities!  Bearing that in mind, this book's information does seem to be on target.<br />I do have reservations on Dr. Fogle's training tips, one in particular involving use of a mouse trap concealed under newspapers which a prized plant is on.  The theory is that the cat approaching the plant with the idea of chewing its leaves will set off the trap, causing the papers to suddenly explode along with the noise of the trap.  Seems to me that the cat could get a paw or tail caught in the trap.<br />Much of the book covers pregnancy and the raising of kittens.  Again, this ia all profusely illustrated, there being pictures along with the text on every page.  The text is, at times, a bit dry and impersonal, but the pictures more than make up for this shortcoming.  <br />I do believe that you and your cat(s) will benefit from this book.  <br />Other than that, this is an informative and useful book.  Chances are that you'll read a bit at a time, and not necessarily cover to cover.	2002-07-11

During the years of radio drama, Dashell Hammett's Nick Charles and Sam Spade had their own weekly radio shows, and movie flings.  But one series based on a Dashell Hammett character was puzzling:  \\"The Fat Man\\".  He was named J. Maxwell Smart, weighed 240 lb., and of course was one tough character.  Yet, you'll never find him under that name in any Hammett story.  The radio, tv, & movie character was, in fact, based on the nameless Continental Op.<br />Truly, he is the most interesting of Hammett's series characters.  He is tough, ethical according to his code, and keeps his true emotions buried under the toughness and the physical bulk.  He is a cynic, one who assumes that each person involved is undoubtedly lying.  On the occasions that a female character makes a play for him, he assumes that she has an angle.  And he, in turn, formulates his own lies which have the effect of bringing out the truth.  There are times that he is as surprised at the outcome as the reader is.   <br />Hammett is skillful in the way he keeps the op in character, and the reader needs to be alert to catch some of the subtleties such as a restrained sense of humor when the crooks trap themselves by thinking he's after them when he's completely unaware of what they've done; a buried feeling of remorse when a client is murdered because the op had the wrong assumption; a decision not to unnecessarily involve an erring wife who's resigned herself to having her infidelity revealed.<br />These stories indeed have literary value while being engrossing crime stories.  If you enjoy today's tough police detectives such as Harry Bosch, you will find these far earlier stories engrossing.	2002-07-11

The focus point here is on just what education should produce.  At present, it produces students intellectually prepared for their life's journey, but without a clue when it comes to self-knowledge.  In fact, in Krishnamurti's eyes, education as it presently is, or at least was in the 50's when the book was written (and I haven't really seen evidence of huge change yet), discourages self-knowledge and focuses on false values, such as financial success and prestige.  <br />The present educational system teaches reliance on authority, on books.  <br />Krishnamurti comes down hard on the nationalistic mode our youth are molded in.  This point may be difficult to agree with in today's America, especially in the past year.  There has been a huge swing in patriotism since Sept. 11, and this is quite natural.  And to read Krishnamurti's pleas to free ourselves from nationalism, from patriotism, may well be difficult.<br />And yet, if we truly want peace on this planet, loyalty to nation and loyalty to religion are blocks, according to Krishnamurti.  <br />This is a book to read and study, even if you are uneasy with some points.  I don't mean that this is a philosophy to pick up on and make the ruler of your life. And Krishnamurti makes it quite obvious that this isn't what he wants.  Self-knowledge includes self-rule nd self-responsibility.  Even if you, as I did, have a few reservations, this is a philosophy to consider, one which may call for action on your part to bring out a positive change in our educational system.	2002-07-09

And I did enjoy it, but it didn't grab hold of me like Raymond Chandler's stories.  I had no trouble lying it down around the 2/3 point, and eventually coming back to finish it.  I always had a bit more trouble lying down a Raymond Chandler story.  <br />I didn't often stop and look through earlier parts to confirm an idea in my mind, as I did with Chandler.  I didn't have any &quot;aha!&quot;s throughout the book.   <br />The Marlowe characterization was weak.  I didn't notice that he quit smoking in the middle of the book, as one reviewer thought he noticed...in fact, he kept up pretty well with alternating between the pipe and cigarettes all the way through.  Being married does obviously create problems he hadn't had before.  It does inhibit him, and just the situation does keep him from being the Marlowe we're used to.  He has someone else besides himself to think of now, and it's messing up his basic style.<br />The case he's working on and the subplot of his shaky marriage do work together well enough, because the personal challenges in his life are affecting his feelings toward the characters involved.  <br />On it's own, this is good enough, but not great.  A larger than average percentage of the characters make it to the end of the book.  And Parker doesn't have quite the photographic description of people and places that Chandler did. So it will let down Chandler &amp; Marlowe fans, but supply others with a brisk, satisfying , though likely soon forgotten, read.	2002-07-02

Galileo had the urge to search, as did Isaac Newton after him, and then Albert Einstein...now Steven Hawking.<br />Hawking presents the present scientific thinking in language which he hopes is clear to a seeking reader.  Some will find the concepts difficult to grasp while others will think he's &quot;talking down&quot; to the reader.<br />The author tackles a number of questions, and doesn't give us cut and dried answers.  Rather, he presents us with the results of current scientific thinking and theory.  He doesn't insist that we accept all that is presented.  The value here is in our contemplating the vastness of space and time.<br />There's some heavy scientific (for many of us) theory here, but even partial understanding and opening our minds to consideration of the cosmos should fill one with a sense of awe, of wonder.  Agreement with Hawking isn't necessary;  Just the act of thinking of these matters of space and time is rewarding.<br />What you will find in this book is theory which is backed up by scientific observation.  Reading and seeking for understanding of the theories here expand our minds whether we accept or disagree with the theories.<br />One who reads this book seriously will emerge with a feeling of awe of the cosmos, awe of space and time.  Some will find it hard to understand, and with patience, will be able to grasp it with one or two additional readings.  Others will understand it right off.	2002-07-02

The detective pulps such as \\"Black Mask\\" and \\"Dime Detective\\" were training grounds for the like of Erle Stanley Gardner, Dashell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler.<br />This volume gives us Raymond Chandler's essay of the detective genre plus twelve novellas and short stories basically from the pulp magazines.  <br />Four of these are Phillip Marlowe adventures, all written before the novels.  Of these, \\"Goldfish\\" and \\"Trouble is My Business\\" truly stand out.  However, there are three others:  \\"Smart-Aleck Kill\\" with Johnny Dalmas, the notable \\"Guns at Cyrano's\\" with Ted Carmady, and \\"The King in Yellow\\" featuring hotel detective turned private eye Steve Grayce.  Each of these three stories feature a very obvious antecedent to Phillip Marlowe.  <br />Raymond Chandler is noted especially for his concise but rich descriptions of locale and also of characters.  These are practically photographic descriptions.  Also, there's Chandler's dialogue complete with sardonic humor and wisecracks.  The plot is swift paced with nary a dull moment.  He was well trained by BLACK MASK's editor who suggested that whenever the plot threatens to bog down, have a man with a gun in his hand walk into the scene.  <br />Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler shaped the tough private eye genre which spawned Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, Richard Prather's Shell Scott, Robert Parker's Spenser, and also today's police detective genre, most notably Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.<br />Chandler termed this genre, as opposed to the more genteel Agatha Christy type of mystery, \\"realistic\\".  Well, that's arguable.  I don't know about you, but I don't ordinarily find dead bodies whenever I walk into an empty room, nor are the people who knock on my door likely to have guns in their hands, or even on their persons, so I question the \\"realistic\\" label.But these stories are good fun.  The body count is rather high in most of the stories, and you can often figure out who the murderer is by eliminating the characters who get killed along the way.  <br />Be that as it may, this volume is indeed highly recommended.	2002-07-01

It may not be the easiest, because you will find promotion of a way of thinking which is significantly different from our own western philosophy. This way of thinking opens the way for the stories of many &quot;miracle workers&quot; who perform feats that defy western logic.  And these stories can be stumbling blocks to many readers.<br />These stories do, however, illustrate various points of the vedic philosophy.<br />I believe that any person interested in religious thought will find much of value here.  Many precepts of the Hindu religion are explored throughout this autobiography, and some of them shed light from a different perception upon the Christian and Judaic faiths.  If a person is open to looking at one's own beliefs through another person's eyes, understanding of all beliefs may be increased.  A person who does not wish to understand beliefs of another person's religion should, however, stay away from this book.<br />Along with the personal, spiritual autobiography and the open sharing of belief and faith are stories of many swamis and saints, and also of two of current culture and times.  One chapter is devoted to noted horticulturist Luther Burbank, and his friendship with Yogananda, giving a different view of the man and of his accomplishments than that generally learned in our schooling.  Another chapter is given to Mahatma Ghandi as Yogonanda briefly knew him.<br />This isn't the easiest book for the western mind to understand, much less accept.  However, it's worth the effort.	2002-07-01

The paragraph that starts out citing ancient history and then wanders randomly back and forth through time isn't rare here.  <br />And then come the errors.  Most notable is her taking of historian Herodotus' observation that Egyptian tom cats kill litters of kittens and flatly says that can't be so.  Yet it's common knowledge that tom cats will kill litters, Egyptian or not.  <br />Later, she shows no understanding of ailurophobia, claiming that fainting at the sight of a cat defies logic.<br />In the chapter covering portraits of cats with their owners, she cites an unnamed critic as saying that only four artists painted cats well, and then names Hokusai, Mind, Ronner, and Monsieur Lambert.  She excuses herself from discussing them in one chapter because they drew their cats alone, not with their owners...this statement is immediately followed by six portraits of cats WITH their owners, including the previously mentioned Hokusai's \\"Girl and Cat\\" (she had just stated that Hokusai was one who did NOT paint cats with their owners).  Then, she devotes one chapter for each of the four painters without any samples at all of the three other artists' work.<br />My opinion is, of course, subjective, but I do find this attempt completely lacking what it promises and therefore do not recommend it.	2002-07-01

This is a great follow up to Roger Caras' A CELEBRATION OF CATS which I have also reviewed.  In the first book, he gives an overview of the history, geneology, and psychology of the cat and of the cat's relationship with humans.  In this book, he zeroes in on understanding of the cat and on seeking the cat's perspective.<br />The first few chapters deal with the biological makeup of the cat and with the cat's basic five senses.  Much of this we already must realize.  Some senses including that of smell and that of hearing are superior to our own, and much of the cat's behavior can be understood by realizing how their senses present our world to them.  From that foundation, Caras' goes into cat psychology and discusses a number of issues such as how cats tell time, how many know how to get home if lost, and much more.  Such topics as how cats respond to music, their thinking abilities, and even their emotions such as love and hate are examined.  For those who have read A CELEBRATION OF CATS, there is little repetition, just what is necessary for those who haven't read it as a basis for the thrust of this volume.<br />Not all questions that are discussed are answered.  Caras presents possibilities and leaves it to us to decide.  <br />Also, Caras tends to demystify many of the &quot;mysteries&quot; surrounding cats, but this demystification tends to heighten one's respect for the cat's uncanny abilities.  Certain aspects, such as whether or not cats have ESP, are left for the reader to decide.  <br />The book is profusely illustrated with drawings, reproductions of artwork, and photographs, and as in the previous book, there is humor.  Caras draws on many authorities and on personal experience in presenting us with an entertaining, educational, and thought provoking work.<br />As much as I enjoyed the previous book, A CELEBRATION OF CATS, I found this to be even better.  Any person with one or more cats in her or his life should gain a lot from this, and I quite recommend your reading it.	2002-06-26
US	46877221	R1WK4R3USROZ62	067149287X	146844776	A Celebration of Cats	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Cats and human relationships with cats	Roger Caras shows himself, here, as being completely an animal lover who also has considerable insight into human nature.  Thus, this book comes from a broad and objective perspective.  He doesn't favor cats above other domesticated animals, but treats them as equals to those others we have chosen as companions.  And because he does have deep understanding of human nature, this book is centered specifically on the human relationship with cats.<br />He isn't sparing in his treatment.  He portrays the whole gamut of historical treatment of cats, not only the Egyptian worship of cats, but the deplorable practices especially in France which were unspeakably cruel towards cats.  Our domesticated cats are traced from their wildcat antecedents, and then into the categorized breeds.  All this is done with a sense of humor and with love and empathy for the feline species.  <br />The typical attitudes of people toward cats, those of both the extreme cat lovers and the cat despisers, are explored and debated.  The statement is made that generalized stereotyping of animal species is just as inaccurate as similar stereotyping of people by race or religion.  Each animal is an individual.  <br />Every aspect of our relationship with cats is explored, the history, the psychology, the biological factors, the mythology, breeding and cat shows, etc.  He brings out the beneficial influences cats can have in our lives, but balances it with discussion of those who are well-meaning, but who should not have cats.  Only in the final chapter does he go into stories about his own cat family.<br />This is an excellant book and I recommend it strongly to all cat lovers and those who seek understanding of cats and of those of us who love them.	2002-06-24

And the arrangement of the pictures into the categories of kittens, country cats, suburban cats, and city cats is noteworthy.<br />This is a book for cat lovers to look through leisurely, enjoy the pictures...the commentary is well spaced and rather like words from a friend who's also a cat lover.  And of course, this sure would be a welcome gift to a cat lover.	2002-06-17

However, I do consider it basically speculative and of more interest to those who are metaphysically inclined than to those of a more scientific background.  Talbot does cite a number of scientists, including ones as highly respected as Albert Einstein and Bohr.  However, many others are ones who are more controversial than accepted.<br />Also cited are such people as Larry Dossey, Louise Hay, Carlos Castaneda and Ram Dass, people for whom I have at least partial respect, but who are not exactly accepted with open arms by basic scientists.<br />It is fascinating reading.  And I'll share this with you...while reading it and being geared to thoughts of the synchrocity in life, I apparantly attracted a number of &quot;coincidences&quot; into my life including a very welcome and needed windfall...not a huge one, but enough to enable me to do something I ernestly desired to do.<br />I have always felt that our thoughts are powerful and capable of affecting our own personal lives.  Talbot does go a bit further, though, and I can't presently buy the whole enchilada.  But I am glad I discovered the book and do recommend it to those who are willing to stretch their minds.	2002-06-15

Several veterinarian/writers are represented here, so one will encounter slightly contradictory information and suggestions.  For instance, one writer says it's best to adopt only one kitten from a litter so that it will bond better with the human, while another says it's good to adopt two from the litter as they will bond better together than with other cats.  So, you takes your choice!  <br />Basically, this book gives more in the way of guidelines than in specific information.  You're given the basic nutritional requirements of both kittens and adult cats, and how to read the analysis on the food packages.  You're given basic guidelines as to when to take your cat in for shots and a check-up exam.  Emphasis is given on dental care (That's lots of fun...LOL) and why it's important.  And there is information on the most common diseases to affect cats and how to recognize symptoms.  <br />There's a lot of detailed information missing here, but it does give you the most important points to be aware of.	2002-06-13

I was hugely imressed by the first three Connelly books I read...two of them featuring Harry Bosch and the other with Terry McCaleb.  VOID MOON seemed a letdown, and I hoped that this one with both major characters would be back to what I expect from Connelly.  No such luck.<br />Primarily the &quot;mystery&quot; is very disappointing.  You should have it all figured by the time you're a third through.  I did miss one element, but the rest was painfully obvious.  I was so disappointed that I came close to giving this two stars.  However, the characterization was strong all the way through and the climactic scenes made much of the preceding more worthwhile.  We're taken deeper within the psyches of each, and the last few chapters sharply define the inner selves of the two main characters.  <br />References to earlier novels and brief glimpses of characters we met in previous novels do help keep the interest.  I was quite pleased that one character from VOID MOON made an appearance.  I think Connelly likes his characters and keeps us informed as to how they're doing.  This was fast reading, and not a complete waste of time.  In fact, I suspect that foundations were built in this story which will influence future books.<br />I believe that Connelly's fans will want to read this, they should just be warned that they may be disappointed.  Those who aren't yet acquainted with Connelly probably would do much better to start back earlier in the Harry Bosch books, and also with BLOOD WORK.  By the way, I notice clever plugs for the upcoming movie, BLOOD WORK, in both ANGEL'S FLIGHT and in this one.	2002-06-12

A reader unfamiliar with his work might really enjoy this, because it is far better written than the average crime thriller.  However, those who have read his previous books will probably be disappointed.  <br />The basic plot is quite familiar.  The criminal, a lady burglar in this case, finds herself with a briefcase holding two and a half million dollars belonging to the mob, and realizes she's in serious trouble.  This story has, of course, been told lots of times by different authors.  Michael Connelly puts his own spin on the plot, but Cassie just isn't that sympathetic a character and I couldn't really care that much whether she survived the story or not.  <br />To Connelly's credit, the story is fast paced and just as his other books go into meticulous detail of criminal investigations, this one gives just as detailed a description of the original theft and of the villianous P I's tracking her down.  Also, there are the typical Connelly twists.  So it's not a bad book.  It should be more enjoyable for those who haven't read his previous books, because it is superior to many thrillers.  <br />So if you haven't encountered this writer, this isn't that bad a first one to read.  Those who have read his previous books will encounter references to a couple of characters from one of the Harry Bosch stories.  It's a fast read because you won't be tempted to look back at previous pages to see if you missed something or to confirm a suspicion you may have as to what's coming next.  And a minor Michael Connelly book is better than many authors' major books.	2002-06-04
US	46877221	R2ST244I455MF0	0446607274	515249324	Angels Flight (Harry Bosch)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Believable insights into big city police investigations	This is the third Michael Connelly novel, and the second featuring Harry Bosch, that I've read, and I continue to be impressed by this author's skill.  In fact, I think I'm getting addicted to it, having read three of his books in a week's time.<br />I've ridden Angel's Flight and am familiar with the basic L. A. area, so Connelly's descriptions definitely hit home.  It's always enjoyable to be able to picture the areas mentioned through having been there.  <br />I'm becoming increasingly impressed with Connelly's description and perspective of investigations.  The policemen in his books are not simple good and bad stereotypes.  They are living breathing individuals, and the author is imminently fair in his portrayals.  After reading a Bosch novel, it's easier to consider the different views of right and of wrong.  Connelly makes it easier to have an insight into all the factors of police investigations and of the behaviours of the law enforcers.  We can more easily see that it's not always that easy to determine what's right and what's wrong.  In this particular novel, you find yourself admiring some aspects of the victim while seeing other aspects that are less admirable.  And this is important to my own enjoyment of the story.  Not to say that there aren't some characters that appear to have no redemptive qualities at all.  But he is fair with most of the characters so that you can understand why they make some of the decisions and perform some of the actions they do.<br />And of course, there is the constantly twisting and turning plot that's been in every Connelly book I've read yet.  He hasn't yet failed to mislead me through part of a book...in fact, I went rather far afield in this one, certain that I saw through some of his misdirection.  However, after being misled, I find that he has been playing fair.  <br />If you're looking for crime fiction that will make you think, that will challenge your deductive abilities and will also cause you to speculate on the ethical implications, you should enjoy this book.	2002-06-01

I was interested in reading one that just came out in paperback, but decided to read earlier books about the two lead characters first...good choice on my part.  This is the earliest book I could find and was a good enough introduction to Harry Bosch, although I would've liked to have found earlier adventures of his.<br />It captured me from the beginning with the description of the crime scene and the Los Angeles area locale.  The conflict between personalities and branches of law enforcement who should be working together to solve a crime is a constant theme woven throughout the book.  And there is a fascination watching as a man's life is pieced together by the investigators.<br />But the real fascination is with the skillful guidance down the wrong path with the main character and the subsequent twists and surprises.  There are clues, but I'm learning that Connelly is good also at tossing in irrelevant information in a way that makes it appear relevant for a time.  There's no cheating.  There's quite a bit that can be anticipated if the clues are caught.  <br />The characters are stricty three dimensional, with no cardboard characters.  Some you care for and some you don't.  But they live and breathe.<br />This can be enjoyed either as an entertaining read, or as a puzzle, a game in which the author plays fairly, and yet very likely will manage to surprise you at least in some of the particulars.  There's plenty of depth here if you choose to read from a deeper level.	2002-05-30

He has the toughness of a former FBI agent and the tenderness of one whose been saved by an heart transplant...and who discovers that the donor of the heart now keeping him alive was the victim of an unsolved robbery and murder.  <br />The step by step investigation and the conflict with the others investigating the same crime carries the story forward.  And then come the twists and the red herrings.  The author leads the reader first in one direction, and then another.  The alert reader will see certain clues, but finds that the total picture is more complicated than it first seems.  I did stay ahead of the author much of the way, but then realized that he still pulled several tricks on me.  However, he did so honestly and squarely.  Connelly is a natural at playing the game with the reader skillfully, without cheating.  Yet, he entertains immensely along the way.  <br />This can be read easily and casually or slowly and carefully as if solving  puzzle.  Either way, it's worthwhile.  The movie version with Clint Eastwood (who I can't quite picture in the role) is due in August, and though I'm sure it will be an honest effort, I suggest reading the book.  There's no way (that I know) that a movie will capture all the thoughts and keep you guessing the way the book does.	2002-05-30

Fundamentalist Christians will probably find a whole lot to disagree with.<br />Many who are into &quot;New Thought&quot; are inclined to stay away from Bible studies, but I feel there is so much to learn and understand when one has a full grasp of what the Bible actually says.  This book is a 47 day study, best started on Ash Wednesday and ending Easter Sunday.<br />Wilson, who was founding pastor of the Christ, Unity church in Los Angeles, draws on all four of the gospels along with an immense knowledge and understanding of Biblical times and lands.  The 47 chapters take us from Palm Sunday through Easter Sunday, day by day, a little at a time.  Each chapter begins with the Biblical account, followed by the author's discussion on the significance to each of us that the words hold.  The chapter ends with a short devotion appropriate to the study.  There is a day by day study guide in the back of the book which gives the Biblical source for the lesson, questions for discussion, and a short prayer.<br />I've gone through this study twice, and have found that it keeps me in tune with the true meaning of this season.	2002-01-30

However, first let me warn you that the cosmetic appearance of this book might turn off many discerning readers.  The sensational title, the quoted reviews from not-quite-reputable magazines, the wildly speculative sounding description on the back cover, and some interior illustrations such as the photo of a FATE magazine might give a very erroneous impression of the importance of the book.  I myself probably would've avoided buying it had I seen it at a book store, and that, my friends, would have been a mistake.<br />  <br />Jerry E. Smith presents us first with the facts and details of the HAARP installation in Alaska.  He tells us fairly what the government says is its intended purpose.  He painstakingly explains the technology of the project and what the capabilities are, and this is indeed where the book starts getting scarier than Stephen King.  At least, we can dismiss Mr. King's works as fiction.  Not so with this book.<BR>  <br />Mr. Smith's style is often conversational, and yet always authoritative.  He keeps the reader interested throughout the book, and gives hooks at each chapter's end telling us what's coming up ahead.  He's easy with the science, thank goodness, since I was no star in high school or college science.  He does refresh our memories of what scientific knowledge is necessary for understanding HAARP and it's potential uses and effects.  Even if HAARP is an innocent little scientific research toy that our tax dollars are making possible, it can inadvertently do our environment irreparable harm.  And if anybody decides to take advantage of the capabilities that Mr. Smith proves it has, it can affect our weather, wipe out the user's enemies (real or fancied), and--according to the technological evidence presented, affect our thinking, our perceptions, our minds.  <br />In building this case, Mr. Smith is fair in citing sources.  If a statement is supposition, not supported by hard evidence, the author tells us so.  I considered some of the sources rather unreliable, but even if one dismisses questionable sources, those that are inarguable are enough to be convincing that HAARP is a dangerous presence.  <br />Once establishing the dangerous potential of HAARP, Mr. Smith examines possible conspiracies.  We're quite aware of the New World Order.  Some feel this projected world government would better the world, end war, enable us to solve Earth's problems.  Others fear the emergence of leaders and controllers who are more concerned with wielding power than with the public good.  Such a group would naturally have access to HAARP and it's capabilities.  Many Christians are convinced that a benevolent appearing but actually malevolent \\"Anti-Christ\\" who has extraordinary powers and will inspire worship from the masses will be in control of the New World Order.  HAARP has the potential of giving such a leader these powers.  Many of us feel such a leader or group of leaders would be inevitable in any New World Order whether or not one gives any credit to Biblical prophecy.  And the author emphasizes what any conspiracy type group could use HAARP for.  There are many other conspiracy theories detailed here, some being wildly speculative.  However, Mr. Smith explains that in this section of the book, he is merely pointing out possibilities that many see as threats regardless of his personal opinion.<br />Finally, we're inspired to action.  Smith tells us just what each of us can do as individuals.  Each of us has a sphere of influence in which we can influence others, and each person one of us influences will in turn influence others, so each individual can make a difference.  The writer shows ways to do this.<br />In summation, I realize there will be readers who will find ways to dismiss the allegations here.  And this is certainly a right each has.  However, even if you reject the book's premise, even if you take the opposite side and decide to defend HAARP, you will have learned from this book and you will have been inspired to take a stand.  <br />I do rather hope you decide to read this book.	2002-01-23

One does not have to accept all that is written if one is uncomfortable with some of the ideas. But if you are honestly seeking and are willing to allow a new perspective to encourage you to form your own ideas and possibly to find a deeper relationship with God, I do recommend this book.<BR>  The first part of the book has a wealth of material on different aspects of the spiritual path.

Also, one probably won't agree with all his teachings.  He had beliefs in immortality in the body, in regeneration, and concerning sexuality which many will disagree with, which is all right.  This material must be read with an open mind, and with a discerning mind which can discard that which one has difficulty with while retaining that which is relevant.	2001-10-17

However, his thinking is definitely non-traditional, and I don't recommend his books to fundamentalist, Biblical literalists.  <br />That said, this is definitely a book to read.  It's not about material prosperity as such, but about over all prosperity in all areas of life.  So if your primary aim to get filthy rich, this isn't for you.  But if you are seeking a more fulfilling life, a greater understanding and closeness to the Great Power in our universe, and a mind-expanding, soul-enriching reading experience, I recommend this to you.	2001-10-13

I imagine that's one reason why he gave it the name he did, instead of emphasizing prosperity in the title.  It's about changing your thinking about finances, health, relationships, all facets of prosperity.  If you believe that changing your thinking will change your life, that we can control our thoughts and by doing so improve our over all circumstances, you'll find this book extremely helpful.  Eric Butterworth comes from a very spiritual, and yet very practical level.  He challenges many ideas that you might have studied in other prosperity books.  Without naming her, he does challenge some of the prosperity techniques taught by Catherine Ponders and others.  This is not to say that you should read him instead of her.  To completely understand prosperity thinking, you should read both perspectives and then be guided by those principles that seem right to you.  If you are open to a new perspective, and not bound by a fixed and rigid mind, you will find a lot of helpful material here.	2001-08-20

And only one detective type which classifies as mystery because of the mysterious &quot;Fatima&quot;.  Still, a great collection.  Top of the heap is the &quot;Suspense&quot; classic, &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; with the great Orson Wells at his greatest.  &quot;Escape&quot; is represented as mentioned above with &quot;Country of the Blind&quot;, a H. G. Wells story, spotlighting the terrific use of sound effects and music in telling the story.  Then, there's not one, but two examples of the great Arch Oboler.  First, there's &quot;Cat Wife&quot; on &quot;Everyman's Theater&quot;, an admittedly preposterous supernatural story, but made one of the most entertaining entries here because of the Oboler genius of use of the voices.  The &quot;Lights Out&quot; episode, also featuring Oboler's talent, was the lesser of the two, but quite interesting because of the dramatic acting by singer Dinah Shore and tough voiced Gloria Blondell.  &quot;The Whistler&quot; and &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; were two of the best loved mystery series, and the theme music of the former, and use of the organ in the latter definitely are masterful.  But the episode which I found most interesting and surprising personally was the story, &quot;Killer, Come Back to Me&quot; on Molle Mystery Theater, a gangster story by a fledgling author by the name of Ray Bradbury while he was still writing for the detective pulps, before he found himself in the horror and science fiction genres which made him famous.  I am sure that while many Bradbury stories were dramatized on radio, this was undoubtedly the first.  The classic &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; from the Weird Circle series was good though I could've wished for a less familiar literary classic. All in all, this is a great collection which shows how sound effects, music, distinctive voices, stories with twist endings, were all used to create the beloved old time radio mystery.	2001-08-03

The basis of the book is a true story of a dog who lived on the median strip across from an animal shelter in Texas. The humans in the book are \\"fictitious\\", but in fact, as real as those in our lives. <br />This is Raymond Teague's second book, his first being THE REEL SPIRIT which commented on movies with a spiritual basis. Now, he goes into a story that should be interesting and suitable for those between 9-15. The story is told with humor, compassion, and a sense of adventure, not to mention some very, very important spiritual values.  The link between the confused dog longing for love and care and the confused boy, Shake, longing for love and understanding. The story does deal with the real life issues of abuse and cruelty, both toward animals and toward fellow humans; but it also deals compassionately with the human condition. The human characters are absolutely true to life and people we all know. This is indeed great entertainment suitable for young readers, but it also has an important message about the importance of love.	2001-06-29

From the very beginning, he lifts the reader up into a spiritual plane.  Each essay in this collection is bound to touch some individual's heart.  I have several favorites that especially touched me.  <br />&quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; is such a loving reaching out to anybody presently in any kind of pain, an article to give the feeling of oneness with God.  <br />&quot;The Evolution of the God Idea&quot; is theology, maybe, but at it's most personal and poetic level.<br />&quot;A Conversation with a Mayfly&quot; is Freeman at his best, using a gentle humor and fancy in a very deeply philosophical discussion between the poet and the mayfly.<br />&quot;The Seed and the Harvest&quot; is one of several of his writings, taken from his love for gardening, and finding Truth in his beloved garden.<br />&quot;Because He Is Love&quot; is a help to feeling a truly personal relationship with the being of God.<br />&quot;If Your Heart Condemn You&quot; has much to help one who has trouble forgiving the self for past error.<br />&quot;The Four Causes of Health&quot; is for he who needs any form of healing, in any area of life.<br />&quot;Hymn For A Sunrise Service&quot; is a celebration of life.<br />The last piece in the book, &quot;Today Is Forever, Forever Today&quot; concludes with the beautiful story of the little saint, a story also told on Freeman's audiotape, &quot;Angels Sing In Me&quot; (which I have reviewed.<br />These are all beautiful pieces to touch heart and soul.	2001-06-15

Each of his books is worth studying at least once.  This isn't to say that one should agree with all of his expressed viewpoints.  He himself fought against his movement's having a specific credo, arguing that as times change, perspectives change.  But his viewpoints are all well thought out and well worth examining.  The book does give a metaphysical interpretation of the Bible, and as such, I don't recommend it to staunch Biblical literalists.  <br />As the title suggests, this book does go deeply into the healing process from the metaphysical perspective, and the astute reader will learn why a healing might not occur in his life, and how to correct the situation.  This definitely is not an anti-medical book.  Fillmore believed that a person may well need to go to doctors, if he feels he must.  On the other hand, he did not believe that a person can be truly healed without faith in the healing power of God, whether that healing power comes directly to the patient, or through the hands of a medical practitioner.  I do recommend the study guide at the end of the book which provides questions which help the reader to focus on the key points of each chapter.	2001-06-13

The title poem sets the tone for the book, and the forward gives insight into the author.  He does not consider his writing to be truly his own, but the result of putting down thoughts that &quot;Angels Sing In Me&quot;.<br />This book is a spiritual, joyful, loving look at the world and the life we live.  Freeman shares his uplifting philosophy with us throughout the book...every chapter and part of chapter has important insights, though there are definite peaks.  Chapter Four, &quot;Life's infinite variety&quot;, begins with the beautiful &quot;One morning in my garden&quot;, wherein he speaks of the life within everything...even in the rocks and the earth.  The chapter ends with &quot;The I of me&quot; which contains some of the most meaningful lines in the book...starting with the sentence, &quot;Perhaps I am most like a song&quot; and continuing through the last line of the section.  Chapter five, &quot;God's free gifts&quot;, includes the section, &quot;We are not splinter people&quot; in which he questions if a God who is intelligence and love would have created &quot;a world where nothing lives but something dies&quot; and ends with the thought that this &quot;is also a world where nothing dies but something lives!&quot;  In chapter seven, &quot;Perfect world--perfect man&quot;, he gives us &quot;A vision of perfection&quot;, a vision which might not be as desirable as one would think and follows up in chapter eight, &quot;Your own heaven, your own hell&quot; with an unexpected &quot;vision of Hell&quot;, unexpected since the subject of Hell is hardly one you encounter often in his writings.  And I think you'll definitely like that vison...it's not what you might expect.  In chapter ten, &quot;It all makes sense&quot;, he shares two of his best writings drawn from his garden experiences...the story of the cherry tree in the section, Life is effort&quot;, and &quot;A fish not even gold&quot;...both of these using nature to show us basic Truths.  I hope I've done some sort of justice to this book...you'll find it a profound spiritual and uplifting experience.<br />Incidentally, the forward of this book as well as the story of the cherry tree and &quot;A fish not even Gold&quot; are read by the author on the audiotape, &quot;Angels Sing In Me&quot;, also available on this site.	2001-05-30

This is a very powerful tape.  &quot;Dynamics&quot; is defined as a study of the relationship between motion and the affecting motion--the physical or moral forces that produce motion in any feld or system.  &quot;Process&quot; is defined  as a series of actions, changes or functions that bring about an end result or final conclusion.  Healing is defined as to restore to health, to set right, to rid of less than well-being.<br />Many questions are asked and discussed: What is the difference between healing and remedy?  What part does faith play in healing? What is the difference between faith, understanding faith, and blind faith?  What about wholism?  What about doctors and drugs?  What part do they play in health, wholeness, wellness?  What part does the mind play in healing?  What part does the Bible play?  How does God heal?   <br />Healing in relationships, finances, economics...all is covered.<br />William Kozy is a Unity minister and does bring in many Unity teachings, but in such a way that you can accept or not accept them.  I think any person attracted to this tape will benefit from it in a huge way.	2001-05-12

If you searched out this title, it's obvious that you're not happy with your relationships.  But you might find this rough to take, because the responsibility of creating healthy relationships is yours, not the other person.  And you are the one who needs hdaling.  Maybe the other person does, but he or she will need to deal with that, you must be concerned with healing yourself.  So if you're not serious about improving your relationships and therefore your life, you won't get much out of it.  <br />Greg Barrette first outlines and explains the problems, the things that are making you unhappy in your relationships:  sadness, control, denial, obsession, and general unhappiness.  After you once understand these areas and where your individual problems are in these areas, then you're ready for the solutions which come in the areas of surrender and acceptance...not surrender to your situation and acceptance of it, but surrender of self and self interests and acceptance of self.<br />The above sounds so superficial, but the tape isn't..it gets into the hard issues.  Many examples are used, and the one that was most telling to me was his comparing the person used to and staying in and attracting more unhealthy relationships, refusing healthy ones with a person on a diet a jalapeno peppers who's offered a lettuce salad.  The salad looks pretty boring to one who's appetite is jaded by the jalapenos, but he will ultimately be much happier if he changes his diet.  In the same way, we can become jaded by our unhealthy relationships so that a healthy one looks boring in comparison.  Barrette attacks the issue head on and if you truly listen and absorb, you'll find your life turning around for the better.  I know it's helped me considerably in my relationships, but the facing up to the harsh truths were difficult.  <br />The last quarter of the program presents a group of affirmations in the form of a meditation, and don't scoff at the value of these affirmations.<br />If you're serious about bettering yur life, get this tape.	2001-05-10

And yet, the sentiment in such readings as &quot;The Little Saint&quot; can cause your eyes to water, not from sadness but as a reaction to some deep truth revealed in the tale.<br />Freeman's best known works such as &quot;I Am There&quot; and &quot;Prayer for Protection&quot; (Both of which were left on the moon by the astronauts; the latter also being used as a group prayer in many churches) are included as well as &quot;Make Me a Blessing, Lord,&quot; &quot;The Traveler&quot; and &quot;Rivers Hardly Ever.&quot;  Each of these works has its own richness.  Personal favorites of mine are &quot;A Fish Not Even Gold&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Tree&quot;.  However, there isn't a poem or essay on the tape which fails to give deep spiritual insight.  <br />I do warn you that the introduction at the beginning is a bit long, but worth listening to as a deeper insight into the man and his writing...and the comments between Freeman's readings are of value.  <br />If you are a spiritual person, not necessarily religious at all, this is a tape I personally believe you will treasure and listen to time and again...and share as I have with friends.	2001-03-24

Learning that my son's mother has been diagnosed with an inoperable cancer, I have just read this book for the second time and am amazed at what I missed the first time.  Especially meaningful is the placing of James Dillet Freeman's most famous poem (It was placed on the moon by one of the astronauts), &quot;I Am There&quot; at the end of the &quot;Contending with God&quot; part of the book.  Another facet I missed the first time was the descriptions of various people he needed to deal with during this period of his life.  Everyone who has contact with not only those who are dying, but with those who are to be bereaved, or already are can learn from this book.<br />I myself feel that the book is not depressing but uplifting, however the reader should be prepared to accompany the author through the challenges he faced as a deeply spiritual person who discovers that he's totally unprepared for loss of his wife.  While reading the book, one is impressed especially by her strength of spirit.  There are passages where he indicates that her strength was greater than his.<br />There is honesty here as he deals with the fact that he went through a period of doubting that there is a loving presence in the universe.  All in all, this is a book I honestly recommend, but with the caution that this is my perspective.  Some readers may read more into the sorrow than into the love, but indeed, the love is there.	2001-03-19

I live with several others and each day, I tear today's message off and leave it on the breakfast table...anytime I forget to do so, I get asked...&quot;Hey, what's the message for today?&quot;  This is great and up to the usual &quot;Daily Word&quot; standards.	2001-03-14

The author actually makes the concept of experiencing the Presence of God real, practical, and attainable.  One section features a variety of exercises one can use to heighten individual awareness of the present.  Although this is an Unity House book, I was impresssed that the author's references are from non-Unity sources except for one quote from Emilie Cady.	2001-03-14
