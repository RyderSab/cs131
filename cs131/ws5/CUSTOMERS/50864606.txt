After reading her book, I have no  doubt that the witch hunts  were just  another example of the oppression and abuse that society has always heaped on women.An   extreme example, but an example no less.I applaud the author for writing this book  and exposing  this truth to a large audience.	2005-10-08

It is well researched and put together. <br />The book  makes a fair attempt to stay neutral, but I think it was a bit too critical of the Weavers and too sympathetic towards the government on  a couple of points.That does not at all diminish its value  for someone seeking to learn about this case.Its an invaluable resource.The coverage of the trial is astounding. It spans several chapters and is intricately detailed. <br />The whole trial is covered from the pretrial preparations to the day Randy walked out of jail. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, I felt like I  had just been on a long journey through these tragic events .I felt emotionally wrung out. I have been following this case  for a long time and already knew a lot about the case but I ended up feeling even more saddened and outraged at what happened to the Weaver family, and I think reading this would make the majority of people marginally sympathetic to the Weavers, no matter how much we disagree with their religious beliefs.If you want to hear the story reported from both sides, this is the book for you.	2005-09-17

I own and have read the other  2  main books about her-My Story and Lethal Lotita.If you have read My story , then for a  more balanced picture, you should read this book as well.Amy  has revealed that she cooperated with My Story only reluctantly and says that many things in the book were fabricated or exaggerated. I still recommend My story  for a fuller picture, but I think If I knew then is the superior book. <br />This book gives us the perspective of Amy Fisher the woman, not the  scared teenager betrayed by her lover and caught in an international media firestorm. <br />Amy has an interesting, engaging writing style and it was simply fascinating to hear the  whole story from her for the first time  , uncensored or unedited. Unlike my story, Amy had full control over this book and with the help of a co author wrote it herself.Its also interesting to see how the passing of time and her growth as a person has changed Amy's perspective on her past life , affair with Joey and her crime.Amy is no longer the wild Long Island Lolita that the media created to sell newspapers. <br />I hope  people will pick up the book and read it so that they can see that for themselves.	2005-09-10

The book is over 600 hundred pages long  and is filled with occult philosophy as well as detailed  examples of supernatural events, so it took me a while to get through it as I wanted  to fully absorb and understand it all.Its not a book you can read in a  day unless you are an extraordinarily fast reader, but the time  anyone puts into reading this book  is  well  worth it.  I believe that Colin is one of best writers on the Paranormal today.I came away from the book with  a lot of new knowledge and that is the highest compliment a book can be given .	2005-09-08

Although like most people, I find the hippies of the 60's and 70's to be  the most interesting and captivating.    Cleo Odzer was a stunningly beautiful hippie adventurer from New York who started out as a model around Europe. Hearing of a  community of Hippies called freaks who lived in Goa India in the mid 70s, she traveled there and made it her home, and became an important member of the tight knit community.    These Hippies were called Freaks because they were hardcore drug addicts and  serious drug dealers.Unlike  a lot of other hippies , they didn't use drugs in rituals to try to uncover truth or expand their mind. Drugs were the most important  things in their lives and the entire community revolved around the use and smuggling of drugs.    Cleo and her friends certainly did live a life of excess and adventure, but all of them paid a heavy price.  5 of Cleo's friends , including a man  named Neal she had been very much in love with , died at  fairly young ages. Almost all the deaths were directly attributable to drugs.    On the surface these people seemed to live a glamorous life of rebellion  and excitement, but underneath , they were all trapped in the hell of serious drug addiction.    This book left me with a heavy feeling. As I read tale after tale of Cleo and her friends spending weeks on end in cocaine educed binges, of hardly eating or sleeping. Of wasting away. Of  enduring nerve wracking trips through customs to smuggle drugs. Of ending up in horrible foreign jails.Of overdosing and leaving children  Motherless or Fatherless. It just made me so sad that such  free spirited, inventive people allowed themselves to go through all that.    Cleo Odzer returned to the States in 1980, went through a  drug rehabilitation program and got a Ph.D. She wrote two other books and spent  several years working for a drug rehabilitation program in New York. Then she returned to Goa to live  some years ago  and  sadly died  there in 2002.Apparently she had fallen back into her old habits because her death was thought to have been linked to drugs.    If anyone is interested, this seems to have been her webpage:    [...]      This is an intriguing book from a  extraordinary woman and it will take you on a trip you won't forget for a long time to come.    I really  want to read her other books now.	2005-07-08

Miriam and Adam  had been through so much and were so much in love and she ends it with him because of religion? I know religion is  very important to people, but come on! Adam wasn't even that devout in his religion anyway. <br />I'm not one of those people who always has to have a happy romantic ending, but I sure expected one in this case. <br />The book was very enjoyable up until that point. I especially enjoyed that both Miriam and Adam were allowed to relate their versions  and perceptions of the story in alternating chapters. <br />It was nice to see what they were both thinking and feeling and how they both saw the events that took place. <br />Often in books you only get one side of things-the narrator[s].You only know for sure what they are thinking and feeling. So it was great to get that dual viewpoint. <br />The book is a great fictional study of a young religious girl with cancer caught between so many factions-her family, church, state and the swirling confliction of her own desires. <br />Just don't expect a happy ending between the main male and female characters. In the end, it doesn't happen.	2005-06-26

I got very engrossed in it and couldn't put it down. I read it in 5 hours because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.The only complaint I  could muster up about the book is that I thought it was a little unrealistic at points. Well, unrealistic in a real life  situation such as this anyway, but since this book is totally fiction , I can't say it takes away from the book much.  <br />The book is deftly written and I enjoyed reading it very much. <br />I liked the down home feel of the story  and  the Sheriff's MidWestern manner.

It was fascination to follow along. <br />And she imparts an important lesson: That knowing  and understanding yourself well enough to know what you DON'T want in a partner and a relationship is just as important as knowing what you do.That is something that most people seem to overlook at least once or twice. <br />Even though the book wasn't quite what I thought it was, I still enjoyed reading it and I feel I did indeed learn something from reading it . <br /> <br />	2005-05-13

Tragedy.Anguish. <br />This book encompasses all that and more. <br />This story of a young wealthy girls Victorian era affair with a older married Doctor with 4 children really reaches out and grabs your heart.I was surprised by  my own feeling and reactions to the book. Ordinarily , I feel no sympathy for people who have affairs with the partners of others, but I did feel sympathy and empathy for Olympia, the young girl involved. <br />One thing that struck me  is the difference between now and then. <br />Today , adulterous affairs are frowned on, but back then in most cases they meant certain ruination for the other woman  involved. Often you were disowned by your family, shunned by entire communities, forced to leave your home, you lost your child or children and it would follow you  to your dying day. <br />Much of that happened to Olympia but by sure force of will, she battled back and gained much of what she had lost although it took her many years to do it.

But after I have read the book thats not at all what I took away from it. Nancy really did put her family through hell.My family thought I was bad, but they got off easy with me compared to this.But it wasn't Nancy's fault. I agree with Mrs. Spungen that Nancy suffered brain damage due to her tramatic birth. And there were  not as many treatments nor was that as well understood back in the  late 50's and 60s when Nancy was a baby and child.Nancy simply did not know how to handle pain, anger, frustration like most people. Her brain short circuted when that happened and she became confused and violent.  Despite all that I came to  see Nancy as a  incredibly bright, confused girl who was in constant emotional pain and didn't know how to  relieve it or function with it.  I do not think Nancy was a bad person and I  feel that she gets a lot of flack and blame for things even today that are not her fault. I don't think  its her fault Sid was on drugs. At least not entirely.Her and Sid had a complicated relationship but theirs was a love that was deep and true. I know  some of Sid's friends like Johnny Rotten feel Nancy ruined him and  was responsible for his downfall,and thats understandable , but I feel thats far too simple of  an  explanation and its not accurate.Did Sid kill Nancy? Most likely he did, but I think he did it in a drug induced rage  or Nancy goaded him into it  because she wanted to die due to her depression.  Its terrible that Nancy  had a bad start in life due to the brain damage caused by her birth that gave her severe emotional problems and the medical community was unwilling or unable to help her more.Reading this book made me want to know more about Nancy , Sid, and Nancy and Sid together.  I think that Nancy and Sid should be remembered ultimately as having had a great but tragic love affair.Even Mrs. Spungen said in this book that Sid was the one love of Nancy's life and her time  with him was the only  time Nancy was ever really happy in her life even though it was short lived.  The only thing I can really fault Nancy's family for is that the time Nancy and Sid came to visit them shortly before Nancy's death, they were embarrased to be seen with them because their punk appearance  was stared at and laughed at by people in the Philly  suburbs where they lived. I thought they should have  not cared so much what people thought and  been focused soley on seeing their daughter,but nobody is perfect and Mrs. Spungen was very honest about the familys feelings throughout the entire book , even things she probably isn't the proudest of.	2005-04-06

The other reviewer is correct when they said they the Rhiannon in the book bears no resemblance whatsoever to the Rhiannon in the song.<br /><br />The Rhiannon in the book is a cruel, maniacal, horrible person who would fit the definition of psychopath perfectly.I think Stevie was inspired by the name Rhiannon in the book but I think thats as far as her taking inspiration from the book went.<br /><br />But on to the book itself.Its terrific.The story was well defined, well laid out and I thought the story idea was kind of original for the early 70s. To me it is in no way an Exorcist ripoff.Its nothing like the Exorcist.It had a huge twist at the end that I didn't really see coming .Just when you thought things were one way, it veered off in another direction.<br /><br />Poor Branwen. How horrible that she was haunted and tormented by the evil Rhiannon.So read it not because of the Nicks connection, but because you'd like to enjoy a great Supernatural thriller.	2005-04-02

Movie stills were a clever way to illustrate the subject matter and the other real life pictures were great also. <br />The only  possible complaint I  have with the book is is that the author apparently disapproved of Western Missionaries converting Native peoples and he let that be known.This was a factual type book and I wondered if it hadn't of been best for him to not interject his own views on that even though he did it in a somewhat subtle way.

Its the exact same version  of events the government gives. This lady toes the government line as tightly as you can get.She claims to have been an independent investigator but the book is rife with bias and prejudices against the Branch Davidians.I felt like I was reading an official government publication.And contrary to her claims she did NOT put the mystery of an  unmatched leg in OK. City to rest once and for all.Yes,  2 legs were mixed  up and an African American girl who died in the bombing was buried with the wrong leg and she helped solve that, but there is still the  leg of a white male that is still unmatched to anyone and is still a mystery! Guess she didn't want to publicize that fact in her book as thats not something the government to this day can come up with a believable explanation for. Could it belong to another bomber? Well, the feds sure wouldn't  admit that! <br />I was thoroughly unimpressed with this book. Its glowing reviews puzzle me.

Plus she made the unfair allegation that Tim killed Marife Nichol's son when there is  not and was  not the thinnest shred of evidence thats true.In fact all the evidence points in the opposite direction-that McVeigh tried to save the boys life.Only read if you have an intense desire to know every last scrap of information, mainly about Terry Nichols because he is primarily what the book is about.	2004-11-27

As an avid reader of anything about Tim McVeigh,I waited a long time for this book to come out.I was not disappointed. This book is amazing and it has such an emotional impact on me that I have to let months go by in between readings of it.This book gives you a vivid, real picture of the last two years of Tim's life. It reports a day to day account of the last 2 weeks of his life before he was sadly executed.While Tim haters would probably enjoy it,I was heartbroken as such a bright young man was put to death among the hatred of so many.  The best thing about this book is that it colorfully illustrates Tim as a person. A human being , not a monster. A good person in spite of his actions.This writing also painfully illustrates another side of the death penalty from a side most people don't see or care about-the condemned persons family and friends and makes an eloquent case for why their shouldn't be a death penalty in this country at all.    A completely different account of the bombing is reported here and it will blow your mind. I believe most of it to be the truth , but I still have a hard time fully grasping it all and it has not fully sunken in .If this is all true the implications are amazing, beyond the scope of what most of us can imagine and is NOTHING like the official story.  Supposedly all this came from McVeigh in a deal worked out with the authors that they would not publish it until after the \\"official\\" version of his life and death{American Terrorist} that he wanted out there hit the stands and therefore after he was executed.  I feel that we need to hear what the 2 authors of this book have to say.  I am guessing that not many people outside of folks who have a hard core interest in Tim/the bombing or victim's families will pay much attention to this book because it was written by 2 death row inmates and people have a prejudice against taking inmates seriously. But ask yourself-what really do 2 guys on death row have to gain from this other than getting out what they feel to be the truth? Guys on death row  keep little if any money from something like this because of laws that stop them from doing so. And since the book hasn't gotten much attention that I've seen,fame wouldn't be the motivation either.  Finally, this book took almost 3 years to write and the authors claim hats because it took that long to verify Tim's claims from outside independent sources and they were able to substantiate 95% of the information Tim gave them.In closing if you ever wondered about the official story of the bombing or Tim as a real person, not the villainous caricature you saw on TV, then you owe it to yourself to read this book.	2004-11-27

That was incredibly refreshing because  most of the time when reading anything written  by an  victim's family thats what you got/get. <br />In fact the book spoke a few times about a family members efforts or desire to eventually forgive Tim and I thought that was awesome. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-21

I have wondered about even the mundane details like how the calls are routed, how the equipment works, the reasoning behind the lines charging so much money , ect.  This book gives an informative , down to earth ,insiders look into all of it.I always thought that working at a psychic line would be fun , easy money, but according to Mr. Woodruff psychics often get shortchanged by their employers and shady business practices are pretty much the norm.    Mr. Woodruff does have an intelligent, well read writing style.  I admire his candor in admitting that he works more with his intuition and common sense than otherworldly forces. He seems to care a lot about his clients and strives to give them the best reading possible.  I couldn't help feel a little disappointed though. I'm one of those people who wants to believe that psychics gets their information from mysterious forces  that come from totally outside of theirselves.I guess I want  magic and dazzle in a psychic reading. Not to knock Mr. Woodruff or his psychic style.  He is obviously very well trained and good at what he does and has helped many , many people.  The book has a section on how to call a phone psychic and not run up a huge , unpayable bill.  I won't be consulting a phone psychic because I feel that the past readings I got were  mostly a waste of money and I feel I got mainly (...), nobody as credible as Mr.Woodruff, thats for sure, but for anybody who is planning on calling the information  could be invaluable. The author even went undercover calling 3 different psychic lines himself.If you enjoy your mystical mixed with the practical, this is a book for you.	2004-10-10

I had never heard of this story before finding a hardcover edition of this book at a flea market. <br />I had no idea that it is  such a well known and widely told legend. <br />The book is engrossing and very readable. <br />Based on the doubts of a previous reviewer as to the truth of the story, I did a little research. It doesn't seem like much factual information is out there, but from what I gleamed, I believe that the story is true , but that the book changed around,left parts out of and meshed other different elements of the story into one. Whether this was on purpose because he thought it would make a more smooth flowing story of  if he wrote it as he heard it, I do not know. <br />This story has been told and retold in Jamaica since it happened and even by 1928, when the book came out, I'm sure there were already many variables to the story.In my short research, I came across another account of Annie Palmers death. <br /> <br />But I believe that the story is true .I believe that such things can and do happen. If what else I've read about Annie Palmer is true, despite her awful acts recounted in this book, she is treated very sympathetically within its pages.It was very appealing to read a book that is based on a true story and presents these happenings as fact, not silly superstition or  fantasy.I recommend the book. It will draw you in and make you wonder and want to know more about the events at RoseHall. <br />	2004-08-29

They did their homework and the book is interesting and engaging with a healthy dose of background, not only on the LeBaron family history, but the Mormon church and polygamist splinter groups as well. <br />I stayed up longer than I should have several nights reading this book. The story is laid out artfully and flows easily. <br />I think the authors made one big mistake though. The book  only goes up to Ervil's death.I think the authors thought that with him in prison and  then dead that the LeBaron cult died too. <br />They make that assumption in the last few pages of the book. They couldn't have been more wrong. What happened in the years after Ervil's 1981 death could fill another book. And it did. <br />I highly recommend that you check out Scott Anderson's excellent work-The four o'clock murders if you want to know the many twists and happenings that occurred after Prophet of the  cult of the Church of the Lambs of God died in prison. <br /> <br />	2004-08-12

I wasn't expecting that. <br />This was the first book I've ever read of Mr. Sauls and he certainly is a master storyteller. <br />He blends together all the right elements of a great story. I found myself thinking about this book when I had to put it down to do something else and thats always the mark of a fantastic book for me. <br /> <br />I won't rehash the plot since a lot of the reviews have done that already, but this book has more unlikable characters in it than any I have ever read. <br />Let's take Angels parents- <br />Marty Sullivan was a mean , loudmouthed, arrogant drunk with seeds of incestuous desire for his daughter that I believe were there before they moved to the house. I believe the house brought what was already there to the surface, not created it . <br />Myra Sullivan was a pathetic, mousy, religious fanatic who blocked all of Angel's chances for happiness  by trying to control her daughter instead of properly standing up to her husband. <br /> <br />Seth's parents were just as bad- <br />Blake Baker was an ego driven,nasty, control freak who constantly abused his son both physically and mentally. <br />Jane Baker was a shallow, snobby,socially obsessed women who turned a blind eye to her husbands abuse of their son and was more  concerned with who was wearing what at the Country Club. <br /> <br /> <br />All the kids at the school were manically cruel little nightmares. I loved the powers Angel and Seth received and what they did with them. <br />The people they went after fully deserved it.Contrary to most people, I think the spirits of the Wynton women were trying to help Angel and Seth get their revenge, not hurt them. <br /> <br />I wish that Angel and Seth hadn't died . I wish that they would have run away and studied the book more and used the powers in the book to escape and have gotten out of the legal situation that would have arisen from their parents death. <br />If they had to die, I wish they would have taken out a few more of their tormentors with their powers first. <br />I suppose their deaths added an additional level of spookiness to the ending though. <br />The only complaint that I have is that I wish a little more information had been given about the Wynton women, why lightning struck the tree every time witchcraft was practiced ect.Just a little more background on those issues. <br /> <br />	2004-08-04

You hear it mentioned time and time again.I found the first half exciting and I lost myself in it. The stories  recounted in here about peoples experiences with Ouija are fascinating.The second half was more technical, but still informative. <br />Mr. Hunt did present a balanced view. He interviewed experts both pro and con. He presented both good and bad experiences. <br />He also included a section at the end about how to start using the Ouija if you are interested. <br />If you want to start researching Ouija, start here.I think the reason this book does remain such a classic in the field is that its is very well researched and extremely balanced.

As a lapsed Christian, it made me think about God and Jesus . It gave me a clearer picture of Jesus.I thought it gave a more personal clear picture of Jesus as a being, as he relates to people.The descriptions of Heaven were  just... wow.<BR>There are a few things that trouble me. He said he was dragged off to hell not by fallen angels commonly known as demons but by mortal people who died and rejected God. He said he was told by the angels that there are other intelligent beings in the universe, other worlds. <BR>All that goes directly against Christian theology which leaves me very confused.My confusion probably stops me from being able to give a deeper more vivid review of the book.I have no doubt he is being sincere. His truthfulness shines from the pages,but I'm just having a hard time processing that.<BR>If you are interested in NDE's get this book. Its different from a lot of ones out there on the same subject. Not many are told from a converted Christian point of view.	2004-06-04

I read some in the book every day. It and the movie have become a sanctuary for me. Whenever I'm upset or depressed , I they make me  feel better.It draws me into the Libson's girls world and its fascinating and comforting. Lux, Bonnie, Therese ,Mary and Cecilia are so vivid.   Very few fictional characters  have ever stayed with me like this.  I'm sure that there is at least one other Virgin Suicides fan out there that feels the same way I do and understand what I mean. I can only hope that it continues to affect and changes peoples lives the way it has mine.Read it. You might be shocked at how it haunts you and the presence it has in your life.I hope I explained it well.

Serious thoughts.As someone who, while not a Christian , believes in God and Jesus, but is involved in the occult, the subject matter hit home.Johanna is a very likable and sypathetic person.You can't help but empathize at the struggle she went through.It was vivadly brought to life in the pages.Whether you agree with Johanna or not or agree with the conclusion and belief that she came to about her experience, I have no doubt that she is telling the truth. I think that this was her perception of her experience and this is honestly what she believes.I liked the style in which the book was written. Very clear and personal.Engaging.<BR>I felt drawn into the story. I kept wanting to know what happened next.<BR>The story itself is fascinating.This is a real, detailed account of a woman working with a psychic surgeon and the spirit who entered her to do the work for 14 months back in the 70s.If you have no interest in the spirituality of the book, I think you'll find the tale alone interesting enough.<br />I wonder what Johanna is up to now? The book came out in 1982.Another reviewer suggested a sequel. I think that  would be a good idea.I'd be interested.	2004-05-24

Terri had enormous power and prestige in the group. She cleverly decieved Jim Jones and made her escape from Jonestown 3 weeks before the massacre. This book gives you access to her life story and intimate knowledge of Jonestown and Jim Jones.<BR>A lot of revelations are made in this including that for most unlucky residents it wasn't mass suicide , it was mass murder. And it was planned thay way by Jones and his inner circle, Jones didn't plan to die in Jonestown, his escape plan with his favorites ect.<BR>In the other 3 Jonestown books I've read so far, Buford has been treated as an valuable,but somewhat minor player. This book rips that myth.<BR>Its a must for Jonestown buffs or anyone that wishes to get a fuller, more truthful picture of Peoples Temple and its end.	2003-08-31

She doesn't automatically assume that every haunting she writes about is indeed paranormal.If a natual theory was proposed ,she includes that too.<br />It is a reference book, but doesn't have that dry text that most reference books are known for.It is an interesting, imformative read.	2003-07-12

I went up and down with this book.It would really pull me in for a few chapters, then I'd trudge through a few more, wishing I was nearer the end.<br />The engrossing parts of it were super and it is an interesting story.My feelings about this book are mixed.<BR>I skimmed the last few chapters .<BR>I would tell anybody that reads this book to make sure they have plenty of time and patience.<BR>I think it really could be rewarding for a person with both of the above.	2003-04-08

The LeBaron cult is one of minor legend, certainly not as well known as some of the other big name groups.That doesn't make them any less interesting though.<BR>This book is a fascinating read.It is an unforgettable journey into the story of a family -based sect who took revenge very seriously.	2003-03-03

Sadly in early 1980, several months after the book was released,Mrs.Mills and her husband Al were found shot to death in their home.Their daughter Daphne was also shot.Daphne lived a few days in the hospital and then died.All 3 had been members of the Temple .Their murders are still unsolved.<BR>I wish the book would be reprinted so it would be easier for people to find and buy.	2003-02-26

This book was one of those quicky books that comes out right after a tragedy while public interest is still high.<BR>The author made many mistakes such as the ages of some of the davidians ,their backgrounds,ect.Things you'd think any halfway decent researcher would know.The book is disgustingly one -sided and pro FBI.The author has no real understanding of David Koresh or his church members.He just sterotypes them in the worst possible light all through the book.Being that I am a long -time Waco student,I want every book published on the subject.I can't say I'd recommend this book though.I wouldn't.<BR>The only think good about the book is it has longer quotes from several of the big newspaper articles of the time .	2003-01-09

I guess these people just can't stand that the truth has come out about their awful little school and the cold heartedness in their community both before and after the shootings.I applaud Brooks for telling it how it really is and refusing to let the lies about Columbine being a land of milk and honey continue.  It takes guts to stand up against a whole community like he has.  The refusal of certain groups of people in Littleton to admit the truth is astounding to me.  But the book is awesome.It should be required reading in schools.  This book gives you the real story from behind the scenes over the last 3 years.It provides you with a inside personal experience of Columbine from a person who lived it.Rob did a great job of helping to pull it all together.  I like how Brooks shared his personal memories of Rachel,Daniel Mauser and Eric and Dylan.It gives a more vivid picture of them as people.  In closing this book is a very important book .It has a message people need to hear. It has something for everybody.  Anyobody who follows the Columbine story will love it, but I think people who are interested in bullying and school violence will benefit from reading it.I recommend it to everybody.	2002-11-11

Its directed at teenagers and it made losing your virginity out to be all fun and games with no emotional or physical hangups.Losing your virginity should be considered a serious and life altering thing.Most people including teens don't see it that way which is why I believe that most teen relationships end badly.Books like this that  enforce that attitude just do more damage in my opinion.I believe that later in life, most people will regret losing their virginity somewhat if it was not lost to the right person.And how many teenagers have really found the right person?? Not many.Sex is a serious thing,it is not all pleasure and orgasms.It can carry consequences that can haunt you for the rest of your life such as unwanted pregnancy, abortion, stds.And the end of a first sexual relationship can be crushing.I know from experience.When I have a daughter and she reaches puberty, she will not be reading this book.I will find a much better book for her to read.<BR>Virginity is a precious gift and you can only give it away once.When its gone, its gone forever. Just something for all the teens out there to consider from a person who is not much older than them.	2002-07-08

I loved this book.I was touched by it deeply.It was fascinating to see the inner workings of the cult back in the 1970's.I found the spiral of Miriams surrender to and escape from the cult to be riveting.	2002-06-29

I really enjoyed this book.It stands out in my memory.Some classic books can be boring, but not this one!

When I first bought this book,I loved it.I cried at the end for poor Alice.My feelings have changed since I found out that it was not written by a teenage girl who died of an od back in the 60's ,but by a middle aged therapist. It would have been an excellent fiction book if it was presented as that, but it wasn't.I think saying it is real is a [bad]thing for everyone involved with the book to do.I don't like being decieved.	2002-06-27

This book is disgusting.It makes James out to be nothing more than a cheap , gay slut. Its whole agenda is to paint James Dean as a closeted homosexual who used women as a cover. It disputes his relationships with Pier Angeli and Liz Sheridan. He had very deep real relationships with both women. Yes, James was bisexual, but he was not gay. He liked women very much. If you want to know about the real James, avoid this book. <BR>The one good thing about the book I can say is that it has several beautiful pictures of James.	2001-10-23
