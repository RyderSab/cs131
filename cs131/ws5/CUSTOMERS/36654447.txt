However, this book is quite unlike Kellerman's earlier efforts.<br />While I always admire an author who wants to break away from his series characters (ala Harlan Coben, Jeffery Deaver, etc.), I think Jon misses the mark in this one.<br />Jeremy Carrier is not the strongest of lead characters.  At times, his own self-pity and lack of communication skills makes him obscenely apathetic; when he attempts heroics, he seems incapable of filling the hero's shoes.  The whole club idea is so preposterously laid out, that they come across as the Golden Girls on Prozac.  The killer's identity is anticlimactic in the fact that it's a character who has had so little involvement in the book, it's like Betsy Palmer coming out of the woods in &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot;<br />Kellerman's usual mastery of pacing, suspense and intrigue are replaced with long, monotonous scenes, and very little tension.<br />I hope this isn't the beginning of a new series, cause I don't think Carrier can carry it!<br />Go back to Alex Delaware, Jon, and return to those pulsepounding thrillers you captured our hearts with!	2003-12-28

Dan Simmons is doing it in his &quot;Hard&quot; series; now Klavan in the debut novel of his series is doing the same thing with the seemingly inhuman Jim Bishop.  Bishop uses women as if they were toothpicks, discarding them once he's done; he has only one real friend and that is his boss, Weiss.  But still, Bishop is a man who gets the job done, recklessly if necessary.<BR>Klavan uses the green P.I. (referencing him as the author himself) effectively and the shifts between what's going on with Bishop and Weiss are intriguing.  Weiss' character, who has a thing for prostitutes, also finds himself enamored with the enigmatic Julie Wyant, a woman who supposedly jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.  But he's sure this beautiful woman is still out there, given a new appearance by the Identity Man.<BR>There's a lot going on in this book:  why would this killer Ben Fry want to be imprisoned in a high-tech, no escape prison?  Why does he put this mysterious capsule into his thigh?  <BR>A very entertaining book, and if the subsequent Weiss/Bishop novels can continue this refreshing change of pace, they should all be dynamite!	2003-12-11

This is what I feel about FIREWORKS, a rambling, incohesive, dull character study.  While the idea of letting us get to know characters well is commendable, why write a book about an alien spaceship that crashes into a lake and not explore it any further?  Little comes of the spaceship, except the usual government coverup.  Most of the characters are stereotyped to the max, and those few you care about bite the dust.  And then, the spaceship just goes away, no explanations, and we're given this coy cutesy ending.  What a waste of trees.	2003-11-25

Christopher Paget appears in two later novels, &quot;Degree of Guilt&quot; and &quot;Eyes of a Child&quot; which are far superior novels than this one.  Be warned, though---if you read &quot;Degree of Guilt&quot; first you'll pretty much know what happens in this book.  Paget is a little overbearing and cynical in this one and not as likeable in his mature years.  The pace is pretty effective, and the villains are appropriately nasty.  I found the ending a tad bit too brisk; it just seemed to end.<BR>RECOMMENDED IN ORDER TO ENJOY THE BETTER SEQUELS.	2003-03-25

Enter psychic consultant Susan Shader, a gifted woman who is helping David Gold investigate the series of gruesome murders.  With Susan's help, a suspect is found and ultimately pinned with the murders---halfway through the book, so we know something's afoot.<BR>Suffice to say, a cruel mastermind pointed them to the direction he wanted, so he can continue his murders.  It is at this point the enigmatic prologue comes to light.<BR>Glass works wonders with his characters; Susan is remarkable in her determination, and how she deals with a divorce and her limited time with her eight year old son, Michael, who is a delightful character as well.  Susans' relationships with her ex-husband, Nick, and with David Gold, are real and touching.<BR>The novel builds well although it's final moments seem a little rushed and perhaps slightly forced.

Abandoning the cliches of the full moon transformations, and the only at night transformations, McCammon gives us werewolves who actually seem happy to be wolves.  I have enjoyed the other McCammon books I've read so far (\\"Gone South\\" and \\"Swan's Song\\"), but this book didn't grip me and hold me as well.  Michael Gallatin is certainly an engaging hero, and he goes through hell both as a child and even as an adult in his lyncantrhopic throes.  Overall, though, Gallatin comes across as a James Bond clone, almost superhuman, always right, and unfailingly heroic.  I admired his moral code, and his refusal to give up even when odds were wholly against him.  His maneuvering through Harry Sandler's train maze is a whopper; it's hardly believable, but the way in which McCammon puts you in Gallatin's shoes is good writing.  His dispatch of Sandler is likewise satisfying.  Also, McCammon gives good disposals to other nasties, such as Boots, the Vin Diesel bodyguard; Jerek Blok, the nasty colonel; and of course the evil Dr. Hildebrand.  Gallatin is aided in his quest by some noble and well-conceived allies:  the whiny Mouse; the hefty Kitty; the lovely Gaby; the humorous Lazaris; and of course, his love, Chesna.  Chesna is a little overwritten, but in this type of novel, it's okay, I guess.<BR>In summary, I guess I was disappointed that this novel lacked the true heart and soul of \\"Swan's Song.\\"  This is more of an adventure/fantasy in the style of spies, spies, and more spies.  McCammon is a supremely good writer; this just isn't one of his best.  But...<BR>I DO RECOMMEND IT.	2002-12-10

Alten's use of real-life quotes and some fictitious ones, too, adds an eerie realism to this dense, complex tale of one man's quest to bring peace to the earth by using destructive force to do so.  I have to admit the scenes where Goliath takes care of such madmen as Saddam Hussein and Gadafhi are potent, and even in the face of innocent deaths, the implications are frighteningly tempting.  Gunnar Wolfe and Rocky Jackson are formidable heroes, their past a difficult obstacle to overcome, yet their sparring seems real, and the resolution of it, while fairy tale material, still helps the books' heart and humanity.  The apocalyptic scene in China manages to give chills quite convincingly.<BR>Alten does his homework and his skills as a writer continue to improve; a sequel, &quot;Sorceress,&quot; is in the works, and it should be a dandy.  The computer's evolution in &quot;Goliath&quot; is quite a treat.<BR>RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-02

It is so hard to find good horror books these days.  Owl Goingback has a bright future before him.  His plot and characters are well thought out and executed.  Darker Than Night is a bit predictable, but still a fun read.  I found a lot of this book spooky and unnerving.  Old houses and things that go bump in the night type of scary.  I had just a little bit of trouble with what the author called his monsters.  Next time give them a really good Native American name.

The author had me hanging on to every page.  Ms. Reichs moves her characters smoothly along with a very good and tight plot.  Her character development is great, giving you little peeks into their private lives.  The author doesn't bore you with a lot of medical or personal details, just enough to help the reader understand what is happening and why.  Ms. Reichs is obviously a very intelligent person, but smart enough not to put her readers to sleep with her knowledge.  I look forward to reading more about her heroine, Tempe Brennan and the rest of the characters.  All of which, are very interesting and fun to read about.

All the books in his Alan Graham series are full of fun facts and legend.  In \\"The Last Maya\\", Mr. Shuman explores the legends of the Mayas and that they were influenced by the Europeans long before Columbus arrived.  As always, Mr. Shuman makes for an interesting agreement, based on facts and fantasy.  This mix makes for a very fun read.  His hero, Alan Graham is a very interesting character.  Not the Mr. Perfect that appear in so many books.  Alan is a flawed character just trying to understand himself and others, with a lot of baggage from all his travels.  The adventure in this book, takes the series out of Louisiana and into the heart of Mexico.  It was fun reading about some of my favorite characters in a new surrounding.  I have always found Malcolm Shuman's books fun, interesting and entertaining, I think if you like your mysteries with a little history tossed in, this is a series for you.

Yes, there really are people living just like Ms. McCrumb describes in her books.  I know I'm from there.  <br />I'm not going to bore you with a recap of the plot.  If you want that read one of the other reviews.  The Songcatcher is a little bit different than her other ballad series books, if that doesn't make it any less entertaining.  There is no murder mystery, but there is plenty of mystery.  So if you enjoy a good mystery, written very well.  This is the book for you.  In fact, you don't even have to be a mystery reader to enjoy any of Sharyn McCrumb's books.

I really enjoyed Mr. Goingback's style and prose in this book.  I picked this book up because the author was awarded the Bram Stroker for best first novel in 1998.  Yes, it sometimes takes me awhile to get to a book, there are so many to read.  But, rest assured this one is worth the time.  So take the time and enjoy the read.<br />Owl Goingback is an excellent writer.  He managed in just a few pages to have me caring for the characters in this book.  Something that some authors can't do in a hundred pages.  The characters are very nicely written and developed, I was a little sad when the book ended and I'll miss these characters.  As for the plot, it is not an outstanding one.  But in Mr. Goingback's hands it does stand out.  I was tense and guessing what was going to happen the whole time I was reading \\"Crota\\".  I'm looking forward to reading more from Mr. Goingback.  I would say that he has a bright future ahead of him.  A very fun and interesting read.	2001-06-18

Any one who wishes to write for a living should read Mrs. Gerritsen.  This author does everything right.  From the opening pages of \\"Bloodstream\\", I was hooked!  What a prologue Mrs. Gerritsen writes, if it doesn't hook you to this book nothing will.  <br />I was first introduced to Mrs. Gerritsen through  \\"Gravity\\" and was very surprised by just how good she is at her job.  As a medical thriller writer, Tess Gerritsen is the best in my option.  This author leaves the others in the dust.  <br />In \\"Bloodstream\\", Mrs. Gerritsen is once again in top form.  With well developed characters, which the reader will care about.  Not just the \\"lead\\" characters, but all the characters.  Any one who has ever moved to a new town will understand the problems that occur in trying to fit in with the population, especially in a small town.  The author does a great job in plotting these problems into the story line.  And using them to advance the plot.  Yes, I will agree with one reviewer that there are a couple of loose ends.  To me though these couple of things didn't matter to the plot.  They just showed what was happening all over the town.  \\"Bloodstream\\" is a very well written book, with a tight plot and very well developed characters.  I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it highly to any one who likes a good mystery.	2001-06-08

I have to admit that I was slow to pick \\"The Iceweaver\\" up to read, because Hannah Trevor is not in this story.  I also have to admit that I felt cheated that we missed out on the last 23 years of Hannah and Daniel's life.  I got over my sulking very quickly.  Ms. Lawrence is such a wonderful storyteller that it wasn't until I was reading the other reviews that I realized that there was no murder mystery!  This is a very engrossing tale of love and life.  The author does a great job in developing all the new characters needed to tell this tale.  The crowning achievement of character development is Jennet.  Ms. Lawrence does an outstanding job with Jennet.  This was another one of my concerns with reading this book.  How could a deaf and mute character carry a story?  Well in this author's capable hands, it is not a problem.  Jennet comes through alive and well.  She one of the most interesting characters I have ever read.  I always liked Jennet in the other books and even found myself wondering what would become of her after Hannah died.  Well, she has grown into a full and wonderful character.  Ms. Lawrence gives Jennet a lot of warmth, love, understanding and caring, but with that stubborn and determined personally of Hannah's.  The plot of this story is also written very well too.  Ms. Lawrence has a great and vast understanding of the life and times of the people in the early 1800's.  She delivers this knowledge with a wonderful command of the language, both past and present, so that the reader can fully understand what it was like during these times.  I love the author's use of everyday chores to help the reader understand the harshness of life.  After reading Margaret Lawrence's four books, I have to wonder that anyone lived long enough to produce the next generation.  These books are a wonderful testament to human nature.  I not only recommend \\"The Iceweaver\\" but all of Ms. Lawrence's books, start with\\"Hearts and Bones\\" and read them all.	2001-05-29

Margaret Lawrence has such a wonderful talent for bring her characters to life.  There are very few books that use the fictional setting of post-American Revolutionary life that this is a very refreshing and enlightening read.  Ms. Lawrence does a great job with developing characters and plot lines.  Weaving everyday life with the extra story of mystery and murder.  The author makes the reader feel for each and every character. Ms. Lawrence gives the reader a good solid understanding the society of this time, so that the reader learns and empathizes with each character.  <br />In \\"The Burning Bride\\", Ms. Lawrence weaves a very good murder mystery in with the on going story of Hanna and Daniel and their love for each other.  Both plot lines are very satisfying in their delivery and conclusion.  The author gives the reader many suspects and reasons that keep me guessing till the end of the book.  I highly recommend Margaret Lawrence's Hanna Trevor trilogy.  Even if you think you might not enjoy a story set in the 1700's.  This is mystery writing at its finest.  But, start with \\"Hearts And Bones\\" and \\"Blood Red Roses\\", if you read these books out of order, you won't get the full enjoyment of this series.	2001-05-26

Ms. Hart has developed a wonderful character in her protagonist.  There is something warm and inviting with Henrie O, kind of like a grandmother.  The author has also developed her to be smart, brave and very observant.  This makes for a very enjoyable series.  Unlike Ms. Hart's Death of Demand series, this one is a bit more on the serious side, but not so much so that there is not funny moments.  Also, Henrie gets to travel around to different locations.  With this Ms. Hart adds the pleasure of regional interest into the story.  This book is located in San Antonio, so the reader get all kinds of interesting facts about that great city and it's culture.  Believe it or not, San Antonio has more going for it than the Alamo!  Add all this together with Ms. Hart's good solid writing and the reader can be guaranteed a good and fun mystery.  I would recommend any of Carolyn Hart's books to any one who enjoys a good mystery.	2001-05-20

Mr. Perez-Reverte has just as good a plot and characters in this book, as in his other books.  The ending is what I have a bone to pick with, I thought it was vague, after reading it twice I'm still not sure what was going to happen.  Now this might just be me and the mood I was in when I finished it.  The plot was full of twist and turns.  The author interwove about four different story lines into a wonderful book.  His characters are well developed and used very well to move the story along.  I was totally engrossed in what was happening the entire time that I read it.  One thing I will say about the characters is that there is not one that is totally likable.  I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, the hero Corso is worth rooting for.  \\"The Club Dumas\\" is an intellectual read, but fun.  I just would have liked a little bit better ending.	2001-05-14

I have been a little slow in starting Patterson's books; I had so many different series going that I didn't want to start another.  I'm sorry that it took me so long to read him.  Thank you Mr. Patterson for starting another series, so I could start without having to \\"catch up\\" a bunch of books.  I was not disappointed in Mr. Patterson's skill.  He is a fantastic writer.  Let see things to like about his style, no padding, Patterson does not bore the reader with a lot of environmental detail.  I really don't care that the streets were full of trash or that the mountains had a red hue to them because of this or that.  But the author does give you enough to understand the environment and the people.  Second, his characters are well thought out and developed to perfection.  But within the flow of the story, he doesn't waste pages describing every little thing about them.  Mr. Patterson uses a unique way of blending first and third person to tell the story.  This is a very enjoyable way to unfold a story.  The read is not stuck in only one point of view for the whole book.  Thirdly, the story flows from beginning to end.  All the clues are laid out as the story progresses.  So that when the twist and turns the reader is as much off guard and the characters.  \\"1st To Die\\" is an excellent book, if it were a person, they would be in excellent fighting condition, all muscle and no fat.  I loved the characters, both the good and bad guys.  The villain is truly a nasty and mean character.  The good guys are people I would like to have as friends not perfect but good people.  When I first read about this story line, I thought another story about people taking the law into their own hands.  That is not the case here, I respect Mr. Patterson for not sinking to that type of story.  When the hero is a vigilante he or she is no better than the villain.  I whole heartily recommend \\"1st To Die\\" to any onewho enjoys a very good read.  Oh, and by the way, I've started James Patterson's Alex Cross series.  So now I have a lot of \\"catching up\\" to do.	2001-04-21

Not that I didn't enjoy her first book, it was very enjoyable and recommended, I read the second one didn't I?  Ms. Shaber does a very good job in \\"Snipe Hunt\\" of weaving the past with the present to tell a tale of mystery.  She has also done her homework on events and rumors of the coastal states during World War II and the Civil War.  I just love history in my mysteries.  The author also does a very nice job of developing the supporting characters in this story.  I hope to see more of David and the Clegg family.

First off I want to say that John Gilstrap has some of the best characterization I have read in awhile.  Nathan's Run takes place over a two-day span of time.  Mr. Gilstrap does not waste any of this time on fluff.  The author uses his pages wisely to develop realist characters and plot.  The villains are especially nasty and the heroes are flawed but very likable, good solid heroes.  Mr. Gilstrap does a great job in weaving these characters into a very believable and real plot.  There are only two things that I'm sad about, one that I didn't read this book sooner and that it ended.  I really wanted it to continue for a few more chapters, but the book is called \\"Nathan's Run\\".  So if you are looking for a good chase book with good characterization and plot, you won't go wrong with \\"Nathan's Run\\".  This is a wonderful book; I look forward to reading more of John Gilstrap.	2001-04-14

Looking forward to the beginning of each year for a new installment.  Blood Lure was not a disappointment, Ms. Barr was up to her usual standard of great mystery and beautiful location.  You know from reading this authors books, I think that the National Park Rangers are the true heroes of law enforcement.  I'm sure that Ms. Barr is not stretching reality when she describes what these guys have to go though to get the job done.  Nevada Barr takes the reader into the life of a National Park.  She has a wonderful dialog to describe this great country.  If the reader does not feel that they are with Anna Pigeon every moment of the way, it is not Ms. Barr's fault.  The author weaves a tight plot and mystery in this tale.  She had me guessing and questioning everything along the way.  Once again, Ms. Barr delivers a good plot with lots of twist and turns to keep the readers happy.  The added plus, of any of the Anna Pigeon series is the environmental side of the story.  Ms. Barr doesn't hit you over the head with \\"look what we've doing to the land\\" preaching.  But she does point out the impact that man is having on our natural resources.  I like Anna Pigeon's look on life, humans are a part of nature, just wished they would become one with nature.  Well, I've rattled on enough.  This is a wonderful series that I highly recommend.  I also recommend that if you are new to this series, start at the beginning with \\"Track Of The Cat\\".  I just can't see jumping into the middle of this series, I don't think you would understand all that is going on with the characters.  They are such wonderful characters, really fleshed out and full of life it would be a shame to miss out on their development.	2001-04-10

I've never been disappointed in any of them.  I love how the authors blend everyday life with the extraordinary.  Rita Mae Brown shows a wonderful understanding of nature, both human and non-human.  I'm should that if our cat could talk he would be as sassy as these three amigos.  They have a sister relationship, I can pick on her but no one else better.  Ms. Brown wrote a great scene with the bobcat to show how much love these three have for one another.  The author's character development does not stop with the animals, the humans are very well developed too.  Once again, Ms. Brown shows great insight into the human condition.  Friends and family that love and ready care for each other.  The author gives the reader a wonderfully pleasant town peopled by a vast and different well-developed cast of characters.  Ms. Brown should be commented on her dialog too.  It is fresh and witty, true to life.  And so funny sometimes that the reader will laugh out loud.  Oh, yes there is a murder mystery in there too.  I liked the way Ms. Brown ended this particular story.  Sometimes the humans don't get it.  But, she doesn't leave the reader hanging, we know what has happened and that is fine with me.  Reading this book is fun, who cares about the mystery?  I highly recommend this book and series.  I would suggest that a new reader start at the beginning.  It is fun and quite rewarding to watch the characters and author develop with each book.  Plus, you won't understand all the \\"little\\" points of the characters.  So starting reading and get ready for a wild \\"ride\\" in the town of Crozet, Virginia.	2001-03-10

This entry into the Sneaky Pie series is a little different than the others.  That is not a bad thing.  Ms. Brown just out did herself in writing this one.  I didn't see the end coming at all.  Great going to the Browns, you did a wonderful job in hiding the killer and the why in this plot.  I wished I could give this installment 6 stars, it is better than the previous books and they were very fun and entertaining.  As with all of the author's installments in this series, the writing is tight and flows smoothly.  The characters and dialog were very well developed.  One thing too that I like about this series is that the author stays true to her characters.  Ms. Brown understands the psychology of the inhabits of Crozet.  She never lets them do anything that they shouldn't just to move the plot.  This installment also introduces a new character, Tracy Raz.  In my book, he is a welcomed addition to the Crozet clan.  A nice father figure to Harry and companion to Miranda.  I hope that he never moves away.  Miranda needs some one to take care of and to love again.  With the reunions, we get to see a different side to Harry.  Harry does some mellowing and is starting to understand herself better.  I do sense some changes in the air for her and the Crozet clan.  I'm sure that The Browns will make these changes for the better.  Because I'm sure that Rita Mae and Sneaky Pie love these characters as much as I do.	2001-03-10

I finished reading this book about 1:00 this afternoon and I've been depressed that it's over ever since.  This is one of those books that you can't put down.  Matt Reilly has done a superb job in writing this very fast paced action story.  This story is relentless in it pulse pounding, hold your breath and bite your nails action.  I personally lost three nails reading this book.  Mr. Reilly gives you heroes that you can't help but like and cheer on though all the challenges that are laid out before them.  The villains are of the very nastiest in nature and Mr. Reilly delivers on them getting their just desserts.  I will have to admit that some things that happen in this book are just a little on the preposterous side.  But I read a book to entertain myself.  I not going to pick it apart on little things.  They really don't matter.  If an author can write a tight plot and good characters that I can suspend belief while reading their work, they have done a fantastic job.  Clive Cussler and Tom Clancey can rest assured that there is a young buck on the rise to fill their shoes.  Matt Reilly is just that good.  So go get \\"Ice Station\\" and \\"Temple\\" by him and sit back and enjoy the ride!	2001-02-16

I read Mr. Swiniarski's other book, \\"Raven\\" and enjoyed it so much that when I saw this book, I just picked it up.  Thinking that it was a sequel.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized that I had been duped.  What a nice dupe!  This is a wonderful book.  I'm not a vampire fan per sec.  I do enjoy a good book and interesting plot.  \\"The Flesh, The Blood and The Fire\\" is just that.  Mr. Swiniarski does a great job in developing characters and plot once again with this book.  I loved the way that he worked fact and fiction together.  I didn't realize that so much went on in Cleveland, Ohio!  The 30's and 40's were a rockin' time for Cleveland.  After I finished this book, I rushed to the net to find out how much of it was fact.  I love history tossed into my fiction Mr. Swiniarski gives you a good dose of it.  It is tough to cover so much time, a little over ten years, tying so many events together into a cohesive story.  The author gets many kudos from me for such an outstanding job.  His main heroes Stefan Ryzard and Nuri Lapidos are great characters; I felt so much for them all during this story.  The author also does a great job of invoking the era.  Those of us, who didn't get a lot of exposure to the depression and WW II, will enjoy the way that Mr. Swiniarski brings this time alive.  I highly recommend this book.  This is a wonderful book, weather you are a Mystery, History or Horror fan.  If you like tight plot and good character development, this book is for you!	2001-02-13

I'm not going to bore you with another rendition of the plot of this book.  Four other reviewers have done an excellent job.  I will say that a reader should start at the beginning of this series to get the full enjoyment of this story.  Fremont Jones is a wonderfully fleshed out character.  Ms. Day is a wonderful and entertaining writer.  She does a great job of characterization and plotting in her books.  The author is also great at giving her books a good feel for the times.  Weather it be, social, physical or emotional.  The reader gets the added plus of comparing East and West Coast in this installment.  Ms. Day is right, there is a vast difference between the two.  May be next time Fremont can go to Southern California, once again there is a vast difference.  It would be interesting to see Fremont's take on that one.  The mystery in this installment is a good solid one.  Who did what or did it happen at all?  Then the why, Ms. Day as always does an excellent job of closing the plot and explaining the why of this story.  Once again, I wholeheartedly recommend this book and series.  One note to the previous reviewer, read \\"The Strange Files of Fremont Jones\\" to find out about the Fremont relation.  One does not have to have children to have people related to them.	2001-02-07

In the beginning I was intrigued by this book, wondering where it was going and what it was going to say.  Well, I'm still wondering.  Mr. Carr must have wanted to shake he reputation for writing stories set in the past really bad!  Well he did get the last of that sentence right, really bad.  There is no real point to this story.  The writing is not bad and he does have a good beginning characterization.  But, for the most part, the reader only gets a superficial look at the characters.  The ending was dismal.  Almost like the author say, \\"well that is enough pages, I need to end this thing `.  I really hope that Mr. Carr doesn't plan on another one of these \\"future\\" books.  Please Mr. Carr, go back to the 1800's.  Those books are wonderful.  You are at your best in that time.  And please readers don't waste your time on this book.  Let alone your money.	2001-02-07

Once again, Ms. Cornwell's is in top form with The Last Precinct.  Wonderful plotting and twist, in this one.  The author is great in moving her characters into new territory with hints of more to come.  I love the way she plays her characters, showing real life.  In The Last Precinct, Ms. Cornwell gives us more of what makes Kay Scarpetta tick.  I found is interesting and not boring at all.  Sometimes I would get so mad at Kay for being the way she is, now that I understand her better, I can relate to Kay.  Thanks to Patricia Cornwell for the therapy.  Ms. Cornwell has also introduced a great new villain.  I'm sure that we will see more of them.  (Don't want to give too much away.)  Once again, Patricia Cornwell has delivered a wonderful book to get lost in for awhile.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.	2001-01-28

Wow, I almost feel like I could launch a rocket now.  This is the first Tess Gerritsen I've had the pleasure of reading.  I couldn't put it down Gravity is truly a spellbinding book.  Ms. Gerritsen does a great job of characterization, even with the minor characters.  I felt as if I knew each one personally.  The plot is tight with loads of suspense.  There were a couple of spots in the plot that I questioned, nothing that hurt the story.  I see that the rights for Gravity have been sold for a movie.  All I can say to that is they had better do it right!  This is a wonderful story, believe me this will not be my last Tess Gerritsen.  I'm going back and dig up her other books.  They have to be good.  People who write like this can't turn in a bad book.  Thanks for the fun Ms. Gerritsen.	2001-01-28

One for the humanizing that she does to her characters.  They are not perfect and have true emotions for what they have been through. The author is not afraid to let her characters change and grow or even fight change.  Two the excellent writing and plot.  Ms. Cornwell has earned all the awards for writing that she has gotten for this series.  She has never let me down in the category.  Three, I love the way the author moves from one book to the next.  Yes, Ms. Cornwell is cruel and unusual in the way she will leave a reader hanging at the end of a book.  Kind of like life too.  Sometimes life doesn't have a complete \\"ending\\".  Sometimes it will take another whole book to conclude the story.  You have to admit that to pick up a 1200 plus page book to read would be defeating.  And you would have to be a pretty strong person just to get it home, let alone hold it to read.  It is also fun to wait a year to find out how the story ends.  In Black Notice, Patricia Cornwell is in top form as a writer.  I couldn't put the book down, so compelling was the story line and characters.  And I want to thank Ms. Cornwell for killing Diane Bray, I've had a few bosses that I wished would go away too.  I wanted to cheer, but thanks to the author's writing I was held back by the emotions that Kay was feeling.  So, no this will NOT be my last Kay Scarpetta novel.  I've already started The Last Precinct, and it is turning into a wonderful book too.  And I'm sure that Ms. Cornwell will hold true to her readers and leave us hanging for another year about something.  Keep them coming Ms. Cornwell!	2001-01-23

Beverly Connor has a wonderful series going with her protagonist Lindsay Chamberlain.  This latest addition shows that Ms. Connor has progressed as a writer.  This is the best one in a very good series, all of which I have given 4 or 5 stars to in my reviews.  Once again, Ms. Connor gives us a past and present mystery.  Which is solved with a good solid plot and characterization.  In Airtight Case, Ms. Connor shows even more complex plotting than in the other installations.  The author never lost me with this plot.  I hung onto every word.  The ending was well explained and logical.  Ms. Connor's strongest point is her characterization, not only of her \\"active\\" characters, but also the ones from the past.  Reading a Beverly Connor book is like reading two books in one.  Both plots converge in the end and it is a fun trip in getting there.  I look forward to the next installment in this wonderful and fun series.  I highly recommend this book and series.	2001-01-23

The plot of Unnatural Exposure is tight and well thought out.  The reader gets a good feel for the characters and understands them.  I don't agree that this book is a let down.  Others is this series may be better, but Unnatural Exposure did not turn me off from Ms. Cornwell.  This is a very good installment to a wonderful mystery series.  I would suggest that if you were just starting this series, go back to the beginning.  This series read out of order is no fun at all.  Ms. Cornwell does a good job of telling the reader what they need to know from the other books.  But you won't fully understand the characters and why they are like they are.  The Kay Scarpetta series is like a soap opera, you can figure out what is going on, but don't fully understand why.  These characters have been through a lot together, they understand each other, that is why they take so much abuse from each other.  The reader has to understand this too, or they won't be able to understand the abuse the characters can dish out to each other.  I'm not going to bore you with a rehash of the plot.  There was one point of the plot that bothered me; Ms. Cornwell let Dr. Scarpetta get sloppy in her morgue.  I don't understand why this had to happen, but you know we are all human, even fiction characters.  This is still a great read and a very fun series.  So get started, on the first one.	2001-01-19

I bought it because it sounded interesting and fun.  You know what I was right.  This is a wonderful book.  I do not feel that this is a \\"guy\\" book.  The main character is female, just different from most females.  Diana is a strong and powerful female lead.  The kind that you have to have in a book like this to make it work.  I think that Mr. Sullivan did a great job in working out the plot.  I was totally engrossed in this fine piece of work from the beginning.  OK the author did mess up with the scalp thing.  But some times that is a part of the fun.  Finding a mistake that everyone missed and they get paid the big bucks!  (No pun intended.)  This did not take away from the story and was not important to the plot.  So you are forgiven Mr. Sullivan for one little bitty mistake.  I'm looking forward to more by this wonderful author.  Keep them coming, Mr. Sullivan.  I highly recommend \\"The Purification Ceremony.	2001-01-19

I was expecting more of the same type of story line, action, chase the bad guy and kill him.  Not that all this is not in this book, it is packed full of it.  I wasn't expecting the duel story line.  What a wonderful surprise the history story line is.  Again, I hung on to every word that Mr. Sullivan wrote in this tight plot.  Ghost Dance is more complex than The Purification Ceremony.  The author does a great job at weaving everything together.  I loved the visions, ghost, etc.  I love this type of story any way.  You can never out run the past.  Mr. Sullivan does a great job of explaining Native American lore and how it intertwines with modern believes.  I thank Mark Sullivan for putting so much time and effort into this story.  It was great!  This is what reading is all about, entertaining the reader.  I highly recommended this book.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2001-01-19

In some ways, I have to agree with some reviewer that Ms. Cornwell is loosing a little of her touch.  But not to the point that this is an awful book or that I'm going to stop reading her Scarpetta series.  I have to admit that I did stop reading her for awhile, but not because I didn't like the series.  I just got into other series and had to \\"catch up\\" in them.  First off, one should never just jump into the middle of a series.  This series is the number one reason for not doing that.  Ms. Cornwell has always left story lines open for the next book.  That is part of the fun of her books.  It makes you hungry for the next book.  I love reading several in a row; the flow from one book to the next is incredible.  I think that is another reason why I got behind in this series.  So if you want to read Ms. Cornwell, take some money out of savings or eat beans for a week or so and get them all.  Stack them in order by your favorite reading spot and start in on them.  They are just like potato chips, can't stop with just one.  <br />Enough said about the series, on to this one book.  I thought \\"Point Of Origin\\" was an excellent book.  I enjoyed reading it very much.  I ran the gamut of emotions through out this book.  You know that it takes a tight well-written book to make a reader feel for the characters.  Ms. Cornwell makes you feel her character's emotions very well.  This book reminds me of a \\"wrap up\\" book.  Ms. Cornwell is closing some chapters in her character's lives.  Things change in life and so does the characters in this series.  As the main plot goes, Ms. Cornwell moves it at very fast clipped pace.  As thrillers should written.  No fat in this book, it is just lean, trim and fit.  She does a wonderful job of tying this book and Unnatural Exposure together.  After I read Unnatural Exposure, I Thought, \\"wait a minute, what about this other part of the plot\\"?  (Don't want to give anything away.)  Well, I found out about it.  Ms. Cornwell does a great job of telling you what you need to know and explaining it in terms that the average person can understand.  I have fully enjoyed reading about Dr. Kay Scarpetta and her family and friends.  I'm looking forward to taking on \\"Black Notice\\".  I'll let you know if I like that one too.  So hope you enjoy this wonderful series, by one of America's best writers.	2001-01-19

Mr. Perez-Reverte is a superb writer.  His stories grab you and won't let you go till the end.  And then you are sad to see them over so soon.  Mr. Perez-Reverte has a wonderful plot in \\"The Fencing Master\\", with great character development.  The story set in 1866 Spain during the beginnings of the Spanish revolution.  This makes a great backdrop for the story.  The author has a good understanding of this time in history and explains it to the reader in terms that can be understood by all.  The fencing is also explained very well too. This is not an area that I've had a lot of dealings with, but the author does a wonderful job explaining it to the reader so that it is understandable and exciting.  The climax of this story is breathtaking and on the edge of your seat reading.  If you have any hesitation in reading a book written in another language, Margaret Jull Costa does a superb job in translated this story to English. So rest assured that you would not even notice that this is a translated book.  I highly recommend \\"The Fencing Master\\" to any one who enjoys reading.  So have fun and enjoy!	2000-11-20

All reviews I read recommended it.  Saying it was a fresh, well-written story, with good plotting and character development.  I hunted years to find this book.  When finally reading \\"The Eight\\" I found that all those other reviewer were right!  This is an excellent story.  Ms. Neville's story alternated between the time of the French revolution and 1973.  Both periods are fun to read about under this author's guidance.  I won't bore you with a recap of the plot.  This book is packed full of action, adventure, romance and intrigues.  Lots of villains and heroes are used to tell this mysterious, complex, interesting tale of lost wealth over many centuries.  With so many characters and plot, some authors will loose their reader.  Not Ms. Neville, she does a fantastic job of telling this story so that the reader will find it easy to follow.  I will say that you don't have to be a history bluff to enjoy \\"The Eight\\".  I am but the story of these people through time is more interesting than the historical facts.  \\"The Eight\\" is a masterful blend of historical facts and characters with modern times.  My hat is off to Katherine Neville and \\"The Eight\\".  She gave me a wonderful time reading her book.  I look forward to future books by her.  Thanks Ms. Neville for so much fun.

Dan Brown is a genius.  Not only did he get every troublesome thing a person could think of in one book.  He did it so believable.  Plus, he didn't make the Catholic Church the bad or stupid guys, as some authors do.  Mr. Brown also did a tremendous amount of research to get the facts right.  His descriptions of places and ceremonies make you feel as if you are there in person.  The words just flow off the page and into your imagination.  I have to say that this is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I just couldn't put it down, staying up till 3 in the morning to finish it.  Mr. Brown put so many twists and turns in this book that there is no way a reader will be able to figure out how it is going to end, till the end.  I know that the final out come shocked me.  I'm not going to go into all the details about the plot, let the experts do that for you.  I might spoil it for you and that is the last thing I would ever want to do.  All I can say is if you like mystery, action and thrills; this is the book for you.  \\"Angels &amp; Demons\\" is a non-stop roller coaster ride for the reader.

In continuing the story lines that began in The Plague Tales, the author has given the reader another dose of adventure in the past and future.  The Burning Road is every bit as good as her first novel.  In this installment, Ms. Benson moves her characters forward 10 years.  A lot has happened in those 10 years, but you can bet that more is about to happen.  Again, you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy this book.  The author makes the story lines very interesting and explains what you may need to know about the different times.  Most of the medical thriller plot lies in the future story line this time around.  But that doesn't make either less interesting.  Ms. Benson does a masterful job of developing characters and plot.  She packs the adventure and narrow escapes into this one too.

Thrasher's Charlie series is that a small house publishes it and the masses don't know about it.  Ms. Thrasher has a delightful series going here.  Her characters are very fun and interesting.  The author has a wonderful sense of humor that she shows through her characters.  Her main character Lizbet Lange is a great protagonist and with Charlie Bilbo as her sidekick, Lizbet gets into a lot of trouble.  This series reminds me of a farcical play, very slapstick with lots of asides.  Ms. Thrasher has also developed Lizbet parents very well, even though they have passed on to that great Woodstock in the sky.  Lady and Duke are people who I would love to know.  This being the second installment in this series, I would recommend you read Charlie's Bones first.  Although, the author does a very nice job of reminding the reader what happened in the first book.  Charlie's Web is a fun read and shouldn't be missed.  In Charlie's Web, Charlie again enlists Lizbet help to solve another murder.  Ms. Thrasher does a very good job with giving the reader red herrings.  I didn't figure out the murderer till the end.  Although, this is another one of those stories that it is not so much who killed whom, but how you get there.  Ms. Thrasher makes the trip a whole lot of fun.  So get to it and add this book to your reading list.	2000-11-08
US	36654447	R1ER4876B5S6X8	0440225108	7077895	The Plague Tales	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Many Kudos!	Hats off to Ann Benson for two wonderful tales.  Both stories very believable and readable.  I found myself completely caught up in this book.  Ms. Benson does a great job describing the environment in this book.  You don't have to be a history buff to enjoy this book.  Any reader will find himself or herself feeling for all the characters Ms. Benson has developed for this story.  I never knew that much about the 1300's or the Black Death period.  Now I'm wondering how mankind survived at all!  Ms. Benson sure did her research to be able to write this book.  And to do it so well!  The reader gets an excellent description of how people lived during that time.  I'm sure thankful that I live in these days!  Ms. Benson didn't paint a very good picture of our future either.  I pray that the world doesn't come to that!  Between the intertwining of the two tales, Ms. Benson does a wonderful job of character development.  The plot is fresh and interesting, a great \\"what if\\" story line with lots of action and peril.   It does make the reader think and wonder too, about the world we now live in.  I highly recommend this book.  Lots of fun and entertainment.	2000-11-08

Mr. Shuman's latest entry into his Dr. Alan Graham mystery series is another winner.  I like the way that Mr. Shuman intertwines legends/rumors into a modern murder mystery.  In this installment, the author uses the legend of Jim Bowie and that big knife he carried to the Alamo.  I learned several facts about Jim Bowie during a very enjoyable read.  I've always been a history buff, so this series is extra fun for me.  You don't have to be into history to enjoy Past Dying or any of Mr. Shuman's other books.  His characters are fun, Alan and Penny (who is back from her Mexico trip) are very likable, and sometimes you want to smack them for behaving like children.  This is the way of new relationships; sometimes they are a bit rocky.  That makes these characters more believable and human.  Past Dying has all the elements of a good fun mystery.  Take a little time out to enjoy this new mystery series.  I think you'll like it.  I look forward to more installments in this series.  I'm sure that Mr. Shuman will have another fun and entertaining one coming soon.  He has a wealth of events to pick from in the Baton Rouge area and Louisiana.  Thank you Mr. Shuman for a very fun read.	2000-10-07

This second installment of Beverly Connor's Lindsay Chamberlain series is better than the first.  The author used a lot of very intricate plotting, but with a very smooth flow within the story.  I loved the way Ms. Connor weaves all the \\"small\\" details into the big picture.  She shows us that if you just look at one or two details, you will miss the whole story.  In this story, the author uses all these seemingly unrelated events to put together a wonderful story. Of what life was like when the Spanish was discovering this country.  And what greed will do to people both past and present.  This is a wonderful series, it has good character development and plots.  I have still to get the murderer right!  Even the past plot line fools me.  I thought I had at least that one figured out.  Once again, Ms. Connor tricks the reader into thinking things are as they seem.  Again, I recommend this book to you.  If you like a bit of history mixed into your mysteries, all the better.  You don't have to be a history buff though to enjoy this excellent series.	2000-10-01

Dressed To Die is a finely written book.  This plot is close to the protagonist heart.  Lindsey must face that her dear grandfather may not have been the man she thought he was.  This story involves two murders close to home.  One found on her family farm and another involving the University where she works.  Once again, Ms. Connor gives the reader a fun and involving plot to soak up.  What is the family secret?  Who did what and why did people have to die?  The author does a great job in answering these questions, with pose and wonderful character development.  What a fun read this mystery series is, I look forward to more Lindsay Chamberlain novels.  Thank you Ms. Connor for this excellent series.	2000-10-01

I was expecting this little cute cozy story.  This is not one of those.  Don't get me wrong, I love the cozies too.  Ms. Connor weaves a past story with a present event in great details.  Using forensic anthropology to move the story along.  But, not overburdening the reader with a lot of technical detail.  Explaining the things that are happening in common terms.  Lindsay Chamberlain is a strong, practical and smart protagonist.  Lindsay is a person that you will root for and believe in.  Ms. Connor has a very good understanding of the south and its culture.  The author uses all the knowledge to develop good characters to complete her story.  I highly recommend this book.  After searching for several years to find it. I'm sad to say that most bookstores do not carry Beverly Connor's books. I'm glad that I did stay with the hunt, till I got the Internet.  What a great read.  Looking forward to enjoying the Lindsay Chamberlain series for years to come.	2000-10-01

This installment of Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry series is a bit of a disappointment.  I did enjoy reading it, but missed the snap that Jane and Shelly have together.  Oddly, a lot of the messes that they get into in other books are missing too.  Ms. Churchill had a great idea for this book but I feel that she failed to follow through as well in this book as she usually does.  I'm not saying that this book is not worth reading.  In fact, read them all.  This series is a lot of fun and a lot of laugh out loud funny jokes.  I would just say that this installment is a bit weaker than the other Jane Jeffry Mystery books.  But still well worth your time, she is still one of my favorite author.	2000-09-29

Kathy Mallory is one of the most interesting protagonist I have every read.  Carol O'Connell has created a hero that you want to dislike, but you can't help but feel sorry and like her.  Mallory brings out all your emotions.  I thank the author for not changing Mallory too much after Stone Angel.  The changes are there, you have to remember, Mallory would not be able to change too much quickly.  Thank you, Ms. O'Connell for staying true to Mallory.<br />In Shell Game, Mallory has met her match.  With a personally that sees in black and white, what does she do in the world of magic?  With magicians as foes, Mallory becomes a fish out of water, or is she?  Ms. O'Connell creates a world of illusion in Shell Game.  The villain(s) has spent his life practicing misdirection, trickery and lies.  Mallory has too, but is 50 years short on experience against these guys.  Oh, what a tangled web they can weave.  I couldn't figure out what was going on till the very last few pages.  What a wonderful read, Ms. O'Connell's pose is top notch.  I love the way this author writes.  So different, yet flowing and easy to read.  I always set aside blocks of time to read her books.  You'll not want to put her down.  You will want to stay with it till the end.  I would suggest that if you are interested in this series, start with the first one, Mallory's Oracle.  Ms. O'Connell develops Mallory over the course of all her books.  To miss one, means not understanding a portion of Mallory.  Mallory is the most complex character I have ever read.  So, get started and enjoy!	2000-09-25

You can always  count on this author for a very fun read.  A Conventional Corpse is no  exception.  I found many places where I laughed out loud.  Claire Malloy's  straight forwardness is so funny at times that I find myself re-reading the  lines for another laugh.  The messes that seem to find Claire are great.   The supporting characters are solidly developed and used well to move the  plot along.   I'm so glad that Ms. Hess brought Arnie back, I love that  character.  In this installment, Arnie is fleshed out more and we  understand him much better.  Thank you for that that Ms. Hess.  Oh, yes  there is a murder or two.  To those readers who found the ending confusing,  I suggest that you read the last few pages again.  I didn't find it  confusing at all!  I understood what had happened and what was happening.   I won't give the ending away, but it was the only way for Ms. Hess to end  this mystery and have the happy ending.  And a very good way, I might add.   So my hat is off to Joan Hess for another wonderful installment in her  Claire Malloy Series.  Looking forward to another one soon.	2000-09-17

Ms. Barr's novels are always fresh and fun.  Anna Pigeon  being a park ranger opens the world to this series.  Some series get stale  because the hero doesn't have the opportunity to change and grow because of  the environment.  Not so with Anna Pigeon, Ms. Barr does an excellent job  of taking you places that the average person does not think about or  understand.  The author does a wonderful job of explaining these great  places in America.  This book is no exception.  Ms. Barr has a great  mystery in this book, with lots of \\"red herrings\\".  Reveling the killer and  why only in the last few pages.  Caught me off guard.  All the ends tied up  making perfect sense to the reader and plot.  Not withstanding a very good  mystery, what makes Ms. Barr's stories so fun too is her descriptions of  the environment and people.  The author beautifully describes the nature of  this part of America.  I felt that I was there experiencing right along  with Anna.  The Anna Pigeon series is a very fun read.  I always look  forward to the next installment.  Wondering where Nevada Barr is going to  take me next.  I know that it will be a fun experience.  Read them all, I  think you will enjoy yourself and wish that you had started earlier.	2000-09-09

Waiting for a year  plus for another Dirk Pitt was torture.  I have been a fan of Mr. Cussler  since Rise The Titanic.  His books have always been such a pleasure to  read.  Fun adventure, total escapism.  The good guys win and the bad guys  get theirs.  A new take on the old western books.  Mr. Cussler does a  wonderful job of explaining the high tech end of things and makes the story  in his books seem real.  This book is no exception.  The four main  characters are fun and interesting.  Kurt and Joe the two lead characters  are as much fun as Dirk and Al.  May be even a bit funnier.  The addition  of a married couple is an added bonus, for a anchor to the plot.  The plot  of this book is tight with some very nasty villains.  The \\"heroine in  distress\\" in this book could use a bit more fleshing out.  But you do  understand her and root for her.  Over all a very fun book to escape into  for a couple of days.	2000-09-09

I couldn't put it down, staying up till 3 in the morning to finsh it.  One  reviewer says that he couldn't even stop at the end of chapters.  I didn't  even notice most of them.  Just kept on going.  The author's raise some  great questions about gene modification.  Douglas Preston knows what he is  talking about, being the brother of Richard Preston, the author of the Hot  Zone.  And it shows in this book.  The edge of your seat writing is so  tense.  Our unlikly heroes try to do the right things, but the villan is  just so nasty that it seems that nothing will stop him.  The pay off is  great.  Just Desserts all around.  I highly recommend all of Douglas  Preston and Lincoln Child's books.  Great adventure and real tense reading.	2000-09-06

Malcolm Shuman has given us a very human, likable hero  in Alan Graham, a contract archaeologist.  Chosing this profession makes  for some interesting plots.  With this profession one can't always assume  who are the good guys.  Mr. Shuman has given us a very good history back  ground with a good murder mystery.  Lots of twist and turns and good  resolution.  The supporting cast is fun too.  I only wish that Mr. Shuman  would explore David more, he seems like a nice friend to Alan.  Good  romantic conflict with the new contract archaeologist on the block, P. E.  Courtney.  There are some really fun stuff that goes on between P.E. and  Alan.  Well worth the time to read this book.  Start with the this one and  travel along with our heroes and Mr. Shuman.  I really enjoyed reading this  book.  Hope you do too!	2000-08-30

Mr. Shuman as always taken his readers on a wonderful  adventure, full of twist and turns.  This book has plenty of them too!  The  only thing I missed was Pepper.  I understand why Mr. Shuman sent her on a  trip in this one, but I still don't have to like it.  Alan gets his head on  a little better in this adventure.  Which is nice.  As I've said before,  Alan is a very likable hero, but sometimes he can be such a jerk.  That is  part of the fun of this series.  Alan is a bit like Harlan Coben's hero  Myron.  Very human.  Keep them coming Mr. Shuman.  Thank you for all the  fun!	2000-08-30

Sometimes in real life, courtship can be slow.  And to top it off, Michael  seems to be moving away from Fremont and acting like a real jerk.

The mystery and touch of romance are very  well handled by Ms. Day too.  Yes, among all the rubble, Fremont finds a  murder to solve and some one to fall in love with.

In this one, she has brought a little known period of America's history to  the front, and done an excellent job with it.  She also tackels a most  modern issue in this one, with the problems of the times this book is set  in.  I'm so glad that Fremont and Michael are so progressive thinking.

This last installment is the best one.  The way that Ms. Connor  weaves the past and present together for a triple mystery is great.  She  ties up all the stories together very neat and nice.  Lindsey is a great  hero, very human.  Her love life is always interesting, Ms. Connor gives  you the pay off in this one that you hoped for in another book.  Very  nicely done, author's usually don't make you wait for the romance pay off.   <br />I would suggest that you start at the beginning of this series.  Ms.  Connor does tie each book to the next and her development of one character  may be in another book.  But it is there, plus it is fun to watch an author  develop over each book.<br />Now a word to the publisher, GET BEVERLY CONNOR'S  BOOKS OUT TO THE PUBLIC!

Even though she doesn't  name &quot;real&quot; places or people, I knew where she was, because I  grew up in that area off of Interstate 81.  Ms. Gray did a wonderful job of  making her people and places come alive.  She has a great understanding of  the &quot;back&quot; area of rural Virginia.  The plot was good.

Ms.  Sharber really makes you root for Simon's love interest, Julia.  I hope  that we see a lot more of her in the next books.  Ms. Sharber does a good  job of hiding the villians and had me guessing up to the end.  She has a  great way of running two mysteries at once.  One past and one present, then  pulling them together very well.  Can't wait to read her next book, Snipe  Hunt.  I only hope that Ms. Sharber starts at least writing one a year.

I've been a fan of Ms. Churchill for years and was so thrilled that she started another series.  One book a year is not enough for me.  This one set in the 1930's gives it  a difference that makes it very fun.  You go Jill, keep those books a  coming!	2000-05-05
