In some ways its a spoof on the generally lacking stories of most if not all computer games and the author picks up on all the shortcomings wih great results. This sequel is way better than the first book -- easier to follow without the first books jerk jumps from fight scene to fight scene. Abdel is flehing out into uite an interesting character. Maybe not a great hint guide for the game, but an entertaining, solid fntasy adventure.	2000-11-17

I was NOT disappointed. Lately the whole FR line has been getting better and better after a real lull there. Beyond the High Road, Death of the Dragon, the whole Threat from the Sea, Sembia -- some of the best fantasy out there. And The Nether Scroll is right up there. I loved it and even the most passing FR fan will too.	2000-10-05

I've been into this series in a big way, getting to be a big mel Odom fan, and this collection of stories does a great job showing how  big a deal the sea war is to Faorun.

Novelizations of computer games are destined to be bad -- based on stories written by computer programmers -- but this book actually has fun with its own flaws. The people who have flamed it ... were obviuosly expecting some Robert Jordan epic or something ... whatever it was they WAY missed the point. I'll buy the sequel!	2000-05-03

Hansen is an exemplary wordsmith and this is a wonderfully written book.  Steeped in vivid detail and obviously painstaking research, it's  enlightening and informative. If it fails at all its in its excesses. Can  there be too much detail? Too deep an examination of the people and events  surrounding the principal players? Unfortunately the answer is  &quot;yes,&quot; and those excesses make this book a tough, slow read. The  fine quality of the writing, however, will certainly make up for some of  the lapses in storytelling for many readers, especially those with higher  literary standards.	2000-04-14

I'm more than a little afraid to fly, but can't realistically avoid it, so I was in a pretty tough situation. Flying Without Fear really helped and I'm about a week away from my next trip (a long one from Seattle to  Boston!) and though I still have some anxiety and can't say I'm looking  forward to the flight -- I'm really handling it a lot better than I would  have before I read this book. I was expecting a miracle cure, I guess --  certainly an unrealistic expectation -- and didn't quite get it, but this  book has helped me. What it helped me do that was most useful was identify  WHY I'm afriad to fly (Okay, turns out I;m a bit of a control freak) but I  was disappointed that it didn't tell me how to solve that problem. Still,  having identified that, and just not feeling like a big baby, this book has  done its job!	2000-01-22

I guess I had one advantage over some of the angry people who've posted below. I'm not a video game fanatic, so I wasn't expecting some rehash of the game. I thought the writing was  clean and the book was definitely action-packed. Anyone who calls this book  &quot;dismal&quot; or &quot;depressing&quot; obviously didn't read past the  first few chapters. I liked the way Abdel starts out as kind of a violent  thug, but is influenced in a positive way by Jaheira. I had a ball reading  it, and hope for a sequel.	2000-01-11

This book is not only more interesting, but much more focussed and just more intelligent in every way. Something big is  obviously being set up in this book and you shoiuld miss it at your own  risk. Troy Denning gets better and better with age and experience and  though I've heard that some FR fans don't like him for some reason. This  book is exciting, thought-provoking and flat out excellent. Denning is  shaping up to be the best (maybe not the most popular) writer in the FR  series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for people with a brain and those over the age  of 12.	1999-12-09

Yes, it is possible -- totally true to the great old AD&amp;D module and to the great old Greyhawk setting -- but funny as hell.

I found myself having to read sentences over and over, breaking out the jokes to  find the rules. The book covers only the most basic principles of the  English language -- another disappointment for someone who went to school  to learn the basics, but might want more from a book like this. Even the  clip-art was badly placed and only added to the general feeling that the  book was tossed together quickly, cheaply, and without the focus necessary  to be informative. Serious students of the language, keep going.	1999-10-14

Not a bad Star Trek book, though I think DS9 deserves more serious treatment and more maturity in tone and storytelling.

DS9 deserves better, but  this simple, light tale is recommended for younger, less sophisticated  readers.	1999-10-04

I will never understand why people take this so seriously that they could hate a fun, light little book like this so much. I had a ball reading Baldur's Gate. Yeah, the author was stuuck with a &quot;story&quot; that  was passingly interesting in the computer game, but I think he did a good  job making the most of it. What no one here seems to have noticed is the  book's sense of humor. It actually pokes fun at the computer gamne's lame  story at times and even the &quot;about the author&quot; in the end shows  that he was in it for fun. If you buy a book like this thinking it's going  to change your life, you're in trouble anyway. If you like fast-paced  hack-and-slash sword &amp; sorcery, you WILL like this book, even if the  experience doesn't stack up to this supposedly oh so best of all computer  games.

I would recommend it to  readers with a wide range of interests from general world or medieval  European history, to those interested in the roots of western business  practices, music history and notation, physics, astronomy, mathematics . .  .

This is the FR book I've been waiting for, thank you very much! The best of the &quot;Chosen&quot; characters in an all-out magical slugfest. Each of the seven gets basically equal treatment and this, unlike the often  confusing Elminster books, shows Greenwood really maturing and improving as  a writer. The plot is much less confusing, the cast of characters is small  enough to make it possible to tell who's who, and the magical combat is  second to none. Also, this book is just BEAUTIFUL, with GREAT  illustrations. Totally worth the trade paperback price.	1999-08-30

Some of the stories Mr. Grice relates are downright creepy -- especially the mantis vs. the giant cricket. I did find myself disagreeing with him on a few points,  especially his assertion that humans somehow fit into the middle of the  food chain. I'm puzzled how anyone could doubt our species' claim as apex  predator when we keep lions and orcas in zoos for the amusement of our  children. Still, I don't have to agree with every assumption to enjoy a  remarkably well-written and carefully considered acount of the brutal world  that surrounds us every day.	1999-08-09

I've read Baldur's Gate and I'm just dumbfounded by the totally negative reviews posted here. I'm not sure why people are getting so upset over a book that was obviously written with a spirit of fun. Are we taking this  way too seriously? YOU BET! I didn't get the sense that this book was  trying to be anything but a fun action romp through the settings and  characters of the computer game. I've also played the game and though it  beats most CRPG's hands down, I haven't been able to find any real story  under all the side quests and time-wasters. The fact that this author could  even find the story of the game, much less make it as coherent as it is  says something. I don't think this book belongs with the greats of the  fantasy genre but neither do I think it tries to be. If you want a good,  fast, pure fun read, this is it. If you're looking for a strategy guide to  the game, buy the strategy guide.Also, if you're reading the babbling rants  below, keep in mind that as easy as it is to manipulate these reviews, this  is probably one jerk with some axe to grind posting over and over again  under assumed names. I try not to make decisions about what book I read  based on ill-mannered attacks on an author who meant well by people (or one  person) who are just plain rude, obnoxious jerks.

The writing showed talent and focus, though as an American it took me a little time to get used to the very British cadence,  especially in the dialog. This book is the kind of horror I like best. It's  scary because we can identify with the characters who find themselves in  this impossible situation. I never felt like the &quot;idiot plot&quot; was  in effect -- you know, the feeling that everyone's just too stupid to save  themselves? Not a problem here. More than anything this book reminded me of  early Steven King (especially The Shining). After trying to get through Bag  of Bones and giving up after the first quarter of it, I'm happy to have Mr.  Campbell to go to now for a good scare.	1999-08-04

I guess I have to admit that my image of Japanese culture is rather off. When I think of Japan the last things that come to mind are junkies, crime, and moral bankruptcy. I can't say this book has made me feel any better  about anything, but it has shown me that the sort of problems infecting  America today are common elsewhere too. If I had to compare this book to  anything else, I'd say the author is close to Brett Easton Ellis in his  dry, morbid, clinical description of some rather unsavory, unsympathetic,  and generally unpleasant characters. I recommend it only for those who are  willing to learn from the mistakes of others.	1999-08-04

I'll happily put it in the company of Dune,  Neuromancer, Gateway, and Foundation.	1999-06-09
