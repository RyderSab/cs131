I love Kathleen's no-nonsense, no-off-limits-food, get-moving, eat-well approach to diet and exercise.  I've lost 50 pounds in a year, and am using this book to get the next 50 pounds off.  Her approach works and tastes great.  I am not a food weigher, calorie counter kind of person, and her books don't require that.  I also like that she includes recipes for foods that are tasty and so relatively low in calories that if you eat the entire 4 servings, you haven't derailed your diet forever.  Some of my favorites in this book so far are the white bean and roasted red pepper salad, the apple/celery/pecan salad, the tabbouleh, and her orange-raisin breakfast bars.  If you loved the first book and are looking for some similarly fantastic, high flavor, healthy recipes you will like this book!	2004-07-18

But what do you do to make green beans interesting?  What on earth do you do with fennel?  This book has the best vegetable recipes I've ever tasted:  green beans with lemon and parmesan; broiled fennel; baked asparagus; napa cabbage slaw; roasted beets with balsamic vinegar, to name a few.  If you come home from the farmer's market or grocery store with a bag full of &quot;interesting&quot; produce and no clear idea how you will cook it, this book is for you.  Every recipe I've tried is smashing (homemade granola, apple streusel muffins, herbed ricotta cheese spread), high on flavor, quick, and good for you.  Yes, you do have to practice moderation with some of the recipes (like polenta with blue cheese...) but that's what most of us who need to loose weight need to work on anyway!	2003-08-17

I think she's marvelous--and one of the best cooking writers today.  What this means is that this book is more than just a collection of delicious recipes:  it is also full of Nigella's thoughts on memorable meals, the values of simplicity and canned broth, and suggestions for menus.  Lawson has the ability to write about food in a way that makes you almost taste it.  The recipes in this book are easy, many taking next to no time to cook and very few ingredients.  There is plenty of ethnic cuisine (Moroccan, Mediterranean, Indian, Thai) as well as a scrumptious recipe for honey semifreddo (no ice cream maker required!)  This would make a wonderful hostess or housewarming gift, but buy 2 copies since you'll want one as well.  Mine arrived 7 days ago and has already got grease spots from use.  With scores of cookbooks available, Nigella can be relied upon to write a book that is worth the cover price, and will get heavy use!	2003-04-07

But, I suspect they won't be disappointed for long because this is one of the best (if not the best) crafted mysteries Day has written so far. The twists of the plot are much more compelling and I liked the way in which the book brought the Boston period of Fremont's life to a sad conclusion..<br />Despite its Boston setting the book does include Michael Archer, Fremont's partner and lover, but he appears infrequently in this book as Fremont Jones reconnects with her father, loses him tragically, and solves the mystery of his death. Fans of Day's earlier works will like this one, too, but if you are new to the series I suggest you begin at the beginning (The Strange Files of Fremont Jones) to fully understand the book.	2002-01-21

This book definitely falls into the &quot;how did I miss this?&quot; category.  Barbara Hambly is an extremely gifted writer capable of writing atomospheric prose full of emotion and marvelously descriptive. When those gifts are in the hands of someone who can also craft a good mystery, watch out!  I am a big fan of historical mysteries, but only if they ring true--if the author somehow manages to evoke the spirit of the times in every character.  A Free Man of Color does that, transporting us to the socially confusing and racially diverse world of New Orleans in the decades before the American Civil War.<br />Hambly paints with remarkable accuracy all the shades and tones of Creole culture:  from the French plantation owners down through the mixed race free people of color, and down to the black slaves.  Her hero, Benjamin January, is not only a gifted musician but a Paris-educated surgeon, who returned to New Orleans after the death of his wife in Europe.  He returns to the city as an insider/outsider, the perfect person to observe the actions of society.  When a beautiful mixed race mistress to a wealthy Creole planter turns up at the annual Blue Ribbon Ball in New Orleans, January is there to observe, to analyze, and finally to solve the mystery of her death.<br />If you like vivid historical mysteries I think you will love this book!	2002-01-15

I love Fremont Jones, a thoroughly believable &quot;modern woman&quot; of the early 20th century who has a typewriter, a lover, a business, and a dislike of long skirts.  She is also a superb detective, but that skill does not feature at all in this story set in the aftermath of a train explosion in the wilds of Utah.  The story focuses on the separation of Fremont from her lover/business partner and his search for her.  If you are a die-hard Fremont Jones fan, you will want to read this book, but if not I'd recommend just skipping on to Beacon Street Mourning.	2001-12-30

Glynis is the town librarian, with a strong belief in women's suffrage (along with her friend Elizabeth Cady Stanton).  Until this story unfolds, however, she has been less supportive of the abolitionist cause which was strongly supported around Seneca Falls through participation in the Underground Railroad.  Through the events linked to this murder mystery, however, Glynis is forced to rethink her position and ends up travelling as far as Richmond to fight against the Fugitive Slave Act.<br />One of the best things about Monfredo's stories is that she shares with you an entire town, in all its complexity and liveliness.  Every character in the book is lovingly and lavishly drawn, and several plots unfold simultaneously which gives the stories a feeling of authenticity that is hard to beat.<br />You will want to rush out and buy the next story (Blackwater Spirits) immediately, to see how Glynis's friendship with the new Seneca/French constable, Jacques, turns out!	2001-12-30

Set in the colonial US on the New York frontier, Donati mixes several popular genres (the &quot;sequel to a famous book&quot;--in this case Cooper's Last of the Mohicans--, thriller/mystery, historical fiction, romance)and crafts a gripping and highly enjoyable story of Elizabeth Middleton Bonner and her love for Nathaniel Bonner.  The writing is incredibly convincing (I swear you sometimes get a chill from her depictions of upstate NY winters) and Donati succeeds in giving you a heroine and hero you won't forget soon.  I found the style and substance of this book very reminiscent of Diana Gabaldon, and encourage other fans of her writing to give Donati a chance.	2001-12-20

Hannah Trevor, the Maine midwife featured in Margaret Lawrence's Hearts and Bones series, only appears at the very beginning of the book, when John Frayne, newly returned to his confiscated New York home after the American revolution, observes Jennet slipping her body into the lake on his property.  Frayne, an early 19th century collector and redeemer of the lost and the frightened, slowly draws Jennet back into the land of the living along with other memorable characters, like a crippled French soldier.  In the process he invokes fear, loathing, love and lust.<br />Like many of Lawrence's works, this is a bitter-sweet story, hard-edged and uncompromising in its portrayal of both love and anger.  It is also deeply satisfying and it will be hard to put down once you pick it up!	2001-12-20

Perhaps this is, as one reviewer suggests, how Patricia Finney has fun in between her longer Elizabeth I mysteries, but all I can say is she does a lot of hard work too!<br />Sir Robert Carey was widely though of as the Queen's nephew (the illegitimate grandson of Henry VIII) and Chisholm makes the most of this fact in her mystery, using her hero's physical resemblance to the Queen and his father, Lord Hundson's, temperamental resemblance to Henry VIII to build a complicated tale of revenge, ambition, and murder.  A score of minor--but also real!--characters thread through the story:  Mistress Bassano (a member of a real family of Jewish musicians at the court), Robert Greene, Christopher Marlowe, and even the balding Will Shakespeare appear.<br />So many historical mysteries are more about evoking a powerful setting than telling a complicated tale of skulduggery, but with this book you get to have both.  The setting and characterization are nearly perfect, and the central mystery pivoting around the consequences surrounding an alchemical experiment gone wrong is not only perfect for the period but darned confusing as well!  I highly recommend this book, and the other books in the series.  But, read A Famine of Horses (the first in the series) first or you will find yourself a bit lost for the first half.	2001-11-26

A huge fan of Dorothy Dunnett (RIP--she will be missed) and similarly lengthy historical novels I picked this up by chance in London and had a very similar experience: read it all afternoon, read it all evening, stayed up all night, stumbled back to bookstore to get books 2-4. <br />This is an enthralling tale of love, medicine, and clan politics in mid 17th-century Scotland. The central female character, Claire Randall, has been swept back in time after walking innocently into a stone circle shortly after World War II. A former WWII nurse, Claire makes her way in the fierce world of the clans through her medical skills and her blossoming relationship with a tall, red-haired Highlander, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser. By page 250, you will be in love with Jamie Fraser, too, mark my words!<br />I know what you're thinking: yuck. I don't DO time travel. Well, neither do I. But Gabaldon is a great author, and takes the twee convention of time travel and uses it to breathe new life and sharp observations into historical fiction. I was totally skeptical, but I am now convinced. You will be, too. If you like Dorothy Dunnett, you will love this book. Trust me. I'm a historian.	2001-11-15

IMHO, any book that gets 27 reviews in the first 11 days it is issued and is nearly 1000 pages long is pretty darn good!  But, above and beyond these facts, this is a good book, the 5th in the Outlander series.  If you haven't read all of the previous 4 books DO NOT read this book.  Read Outlander/Cross Stitch--you're in for a real treat.<br />This book picks up where the Drums of Autumn left off, in the North Carolina back country in 1771.  There we join Jamie and Claire Fraser, their friends, and their growing family in the colonies after Culloden.  By the end of the book we are reunited with old friends, faced with new enemies, and several steps closer to war.  Told with the same rich detail and spell-binding plot of her previous four books, The Fiery Cross feels like a &quot;book of passage&quot; to me, one that moves the series from one stage to another.  As such, it is not always as gripping, as gut-wrenching, or as wholly absorbing as the first four.  <br />However, the final third of the book is very good, and leaves this reader with a distinct sense that the next book is going to be something else.  Like many of the readers, by the time I got out of the Gathering I was so exhausted I didn't know if I cared what happened to Jamie and Claire.  But keep going, and I think you'll be glad you did.  You might not wear the covers off this one like Outlander or Voyager, but it's a must read for Gabaldon fans.	2001-11-15

At the center is Sir John Fielding--the blind magistrate who actually lived in 18th-century London and started the Bow Street Runners, brother to Henry Fielding--and his youthful sidekick Jeremy.  Because Sir John was actually blind, it gives Alexander a marvelous opportunity to convey rich descriptions, record off-handed observations, and puzzle over inconsistencies of evidence in a remarkable way:  all through the conversations Fielding had in the course of his investigations with his young protege.<br />Now, as far as I know the case of Sir Richard Goodhope's murder--or was it suicide?--is not a real case plucked from the 17th century courts.  However, it is a case that could well have happened.  Alexander steeps his story in period details like the Drury Lane theater, shopping for groceries in Convent Garden, and slipping through the filthy corridors of Newgate.  Throughout the story Fielding and Jeremy are in hot pursuit through the streets of London as they close in on Goodhope's murderer.<br />The plot had lots of twists and turns, and it kept me engaged all the way until the end.  Alexander's mysteries are thick with sub-plots but he managed to tie each one to the larger story.  As an avid reader of Anne Perry, I encourage you to give these stories set in an earlier--and possibly even grimier--London a try!	2001-01-12

After reviewing this and other options (such as Hugh Johnson), I decided that Oz Clarke's book was the way to go.  <br />I got to know Clarke from his appearances on the New York Times Wine Today site, and have to say that this book is as well-organized and informative as I was led to expect.  Every inch of this small book has information on it:  inside the covers are vintage charts, and each page is full of information rather than loads of illustrations.  THe illustrations that are included are well-selected and useful (maps, labels from the most important makers, etc.)<br />This book is organized in an encylopedia format, with everything from the wine-growing region of Abruzzo to the varietal Zinfandel covered.  In addition Clarke includes his top wines of the year, modern wine style, matching food and wine, serving and storing suggestions.<br />Moreover the book is readable--something that few wine encyclopedias are.  It is no small feat to make an alphabetical listing of wine topics interesting enough that you can sit down and read it cover to cover.  Highly recommended!	2001-01-08

If so, you should seriously consider buying this book for yourself, and for any friends who might have the same goal.  I have enjoyed wine for a number of years, but have not ventured forth much from the cabernet-merlot-chardonnay rut because it all seemed so overwhelming.  You go to the wine store and signs give wines different points from different people for wines you've never heard of and can't pronounce.<br />Enter Andrea Immer, the sassy and straightforward Master Sommelier!  Immer makes wine approachable, fun, and stimulating.  Through a variety of different techniques (comparison tasting, old world wines vs. new world wines, flavor maps, and varietal information) Immer will open up your wine world and give you the confidence to sally forth to your local wine shop and ask for a Gruner Veltliner (she also tells you how to pronounce it!)to go with your chicken dinner.  She also totally demystifies the restaurant wine list and tells you how to make good and economical choices from it.<br />There is no pretention at all in this book.  Ms. Immer is not a wine snob, nor does she make wine into some obscure chemical and gastronomical science.  She knows her stuff so well she can make is simple for you, me and everybody else who would like to buy a $10 bottle of wine and find it is reasonably tasty.  <br />By the way, friends much more expert than myself have confessed that they bought the book and found a great deal of information that was helpful to them, too, so this book is not just for wine beginners.	2001-01-08

The result is a beautifully written and fascinating tale that lovers of British humor (with its brilliant, razor-sharp wit) might prefer more than fans of British mysteries.<br />In this book, the first of the series, the focus is on introducing you to the characters:  Hilary Tamar, a don from Oxford; Julia Larwood her klutzy former student, who has a penchant for beautiful men; and the other lawyers who share Julia's rooms at the Inns including Selena and Cantrip.  Julia is the center of this story, who after running afoul of the Inland Revenue Service, escapes on an art-lovers holiday to Venice.  There, she meets her fellow travellers (odd-balls each one), and falls for the beautiful man who is found dead in his bed after she has left it.  All the resources of her friends and former professor need to be rallied to get her out of the ensuing mess.<br />The mystery is not the thing in this book, but the characters.  You may, like me, find the characters alternatively annoying and intimidating.  After 3 years at Oxford, I found them all completely plausible if a bit exhausting.  However, I kept returning to the book with a sense that I must join their world (however uncomfortable it might be)and watch them solve the puzzle.	2001-01-08

A friend directed me to Kate Ross's Julian Kestrel series, and I am hooked.<br />Julian Kestrel is, like most of the heroes in Georgette Heyer's romances, a dandy with a difference.  Behind his suave and witty exterior lurks a serious young man with great intelligence and compassion.  It's that compassion that gets him involved with Hugh Fontclair, who he rescues from a gaming club.  After this act, Fontclair invites Kestrel to his home to serve as groomsman at his wedding.  Once there, Kestrel meets the family (all of whom have secrets, a la Anne Perry), and discovers a dead woman in his bed.  Suspicion turns from Kestrel to his wonderful servant Dipper (a reforming Cockney thief also saved by Kestrel) before turning to the possible connections the lady might have had with members of the family.<br />If you like the regency period, the Scarlet Pimpernel, or Georgette Heyer I think you will love this book and the others in the series.	2001-01-08

The book was an admirable sequel:  it picked up where the other left off, it was narrated by a different voice (Stevie Taggart instead of John Moore) and so had a different perspective, and the sinister character was a devious female serial killer rather than an exhibitionist male killer.  The Kreiszler bunch get involved in the case at the request of the wife of the Spanish Ambassador's wife, whose daughter Ana was kidnapped outside the Metropolitan Museum.  Days later, Mrs. Ambassador catches a climpse of Ana on the train in the arms of a hatchet-faced woman.  With Kreiszler on leave from his institute for children thanks to an investigation into his handling of a difficult child, all of the characters from the Alienist reunite to locate the baby and to find out more about what would drive a woman to kill.  The novel provides fascinating insights into 19th century culture, prejudices, and urban life.  I found the novel riveting, although I must admit that I skimmed through some of the incredibly lengthy accounts of research and detective procedure (such as the ballistic report), and agree with one of the previous reviewers who felt that Carr might do better to focus on people (now that the series is launched) rather than delve so deeply into procedures.  The ending was satisfying, the characters delightful, and the mystery itself was intricate and thorny.  I highly recommend this book to fans of historical mysteries.	2000-11-07

If you want to read a historical mystery that you can't put down, look no further than The Alienist!  Set in New York in 1896, Caleb Carr transports the reader to the smells and sights of that period.  The reader is whisked away to dine at Delmonico's, sit in box seats at the Opera, and learn about Theodore Roosevelt's efforts to reform the NYC police department.<br />The Alienist focuses on Dr. Leo Kreiszler and John Schuyler Moore, who Roosevelt calls in to investigate a serial killer who is targeting boy prostitutes.  The three men join to put together a top-notch and thoroughly modern investigative team (including one of the first women allowed to work at the Department) to delve into the crimes with a combination of psychological profiling and novel techniques like finger-printing and crime-scene analysis.  What I found most fascinating was the insights Carr provides into the formation of criminal science techniques that we now take for granted.<br />Carr is a gifted writer with the ability to transport you to another time and place within pages.  In addition, he knows how to write a good detective thriller.  This one of the finest historical mysteries I've ever read and I highly recommend it.	2000-10-23

In contrast with many of the reviewers, I really liked this book!   Elizabeth Peters Peabody mysteries are not the standard, straight-up  mysteries many of us read too often.  Instead they are tongue in cheek  tributes to the sensational adventure-mysteries of the early 20th century.   More humorous than mysterious, if you like the unflappable Amelia Peabody,  her irascible husband Radcliffe Emerson, their terrifying child  &quot;Ramses,&quot; the intriguing Nefret and their entire retinue then you  will keep coming back for more.<br />In this mystery Amelia, husband  Radcliffe, Ramses, and Nefret make their annual sojourn to Egypt for the  archaeological season.  Once in Luxor their archaeological plans and the  machinations of the tomb-robbers and thieves of Egypt collide at the newly  discovered tomb of Queen Tetisheri.  The Emersons' excavation of  Tetisheri's tomb is strikingly similar to real-life archaeologist Howard  Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, but of course that is not the  point.  The point is who will get to the royal coffin first:  the Emersons?   or the criminal world of Egypt?	2000-08-11

I still enjoyed the book,  but it was neither as riveting, nor as satisfying, as her other Monk  novels.<br />William Monk, still suffering from almost total amnesia, is still  working as a private detective in London in the 1850s.  In this novel, with  his sidekicks Callandra Daviot, Hester Latterly, and Oliver Rathbone, he is  called to investigate the disappearance of Angus Stonefield at the request  of his wife, Genevieve.  For days and days (and hundreds of pages) Monk  looks for clues as to how and why Angus has disappeared.  Finally, Monk has  to agree with Genevieve that the secret must lie in his relationship with  his estranged brother, Caleb.  Caleb freely admits he destroyed Angus, but  Monk is not able to catch him.  As with most William Monk novels, all the  revelations come in the trial, where family secrets are finally  displayed.<br />If you are a real Monk fan like me you will still enjoy this  book.  However, if you read Monk here and there, you probably will do  better to skip this book and move on to another one.

First timers to frequent cruisers will enjoy this book, and learn something valuable from it that they can apply to their next  voyage.<br />Kane's chapters cover everything from buying clothes to packing  them properly, what you should do during your first few hours on board, how  to respond to invitations to dine with the captain, food on board, and  proper treatment of the ship's staff.  <br />I learned the most from the  packing section--always my week point--which sets out in marvelous (and  humorous!) detail when you should start packing (2 days before), why you  need a bunch of electric cable controllers (better security than padlocks  on your luggage), the &quot;secrets of the great tote&quot; (how to include  everything in your carry on that you will want in the first few hours), and  much, much more.<br />Her tips for the first few hours on board are also  EXACTLY right based on my experience.<br />This is a smallish book that you  would want to buy for yourself or someone else at least a few weeks before  you leave so that you have time to read it, digest it, pack your stuff, and  have a wonderful time!  Then, you won't have to take it with you (leaving  more room in your suitcases...)	2000-07-28

If so, you should buy this book and  take Cheryl Richardson's advice.  If you do, I guarantee that in six weeks  your life may not be perfect, but it will be much, much better.<br />I've  tried lots of organization books, time management courses, and self-help  books that just haven't worked, but Cheryl Richardson's book is different  (much like Julie Morgenstern's Organizing from the Inside Out is different  and works!)  But where Morgenstern focuses on cleaning up the clutter and  creating SPACE for a new life, Richardson tells you, in step-by-step  fashion how to actually create &quot;the life you want.&quot;<br />Richardson  recommends reviewing the whole book before you start taking action, and I  found it easy to do this in two evenings.  Then, at a MUCH slower pace she  tackles one area of your life at a time, giving you practical and  thoughtful guidance on how to make changes that really matter.  My favorite  chapters were &quot;Put yourself at the Top of the List,&quot; which  advocates adopting an &quot;extreme self care&quot; approach by starting a  journal, designating a few hours a week for a date with yourself, and  making sure that you're taking time for your physical and emotional health.   For those of you who feel overwhelmed with that list, Richardson advises  taking on no more than one of these tasks a day (and even less than that if  you need to).  &quot;What's draining you&quot; helps you to figure out the  1001 niggling details of the day that suck the energy from you--even if  you're not doing them!  Her mantra of &quot;do it, hire it, chuck it&quot;  is finally getting me through the 247 unopened email messages sitting in my  inbox!  I'm still working through the financial chapter (my biggest  nightmare), but progress is being made.<br />Sure, we all know thatwe should  exercise, get enough rest, and balance our checkbooks--but how many of us  actually do?  Richardson's book is the anecdote for the hysterical pace of  life in 2000.  If you imagine your life differently, I'd try this book out  and see if you can't turn that dream into a reality.	2000-07-26

I vividly remember when John Jakes's The Bastard hit the TV screens in the 1970s.  It was my first introduction to the power of historical fiction, and I've never forgotten it.  Since I'm in a mystery frame of mind these  days, I purchased a copy of his new book, On Secret Service, because its  main subject is the origins of the US Secret Service and the espionage that  took place during the American Civil War.  <br />I wasn't disappointed.  Jakes  has a way of describing historical situations and characters that is very  persuasive--especially male characters.  If you're a fan of the Kent Family  chronicles or North and South, there are some differences in this book.   First, the enormous cast of characters is hard to get to know because  family affiliations (a great organizing tactic in the earlier books) are  not the main thing here.  I don't know the Civil War period very well, and  I think that Civil War buffs will be most satisfied with On Secret Service  because it features a lot of key players in the War (Stuart, Mosby, Grant,  McClellan, Stanton)who may not be as familiar to those who don't avidly  read about the War.  <br />The descriptions of warfare, torture, and  under-hand tactics are very explicit, but are not overblown.  This is,  after all, a book about the bloodiest conflict in US History, and Jakes  gives us as accurate picture as we can probably stand of that  conflict.<br />Civil War buffs and fans of 19th century US History will  probably enjoy this book a great deal, and even fans of mystery and spy  novels will have a good time!	2000-07-26

West's book is a  minute and therefore wonderfully packable book that is ideal for the first  time cruiser.  However, anyone who has been on a cruise will find little of  interest.

One of the best in the Pitt series	Even though I'm familiar with Anne Perry's rhythms as a writer, her characters, her fascination with the secrets people keep, and her addiction to slipping messages about today's prejudices into her books on  19th-century England, I thoroughly enjoyed Farrier's Lane, and was baffled  until the very end!<br />While Thomas and Charlotte Pitt enjoy a rare night at  the theatre, an appeals court judge dies of a seeming heart attack in a  nearby box.  However, the death is much more suspicious than it seemed at  first and opium poisoning is suspected.  But who would poison Judge  Stafford?  There are many suspects:  his wife Juniper, his wife's lover, or  even people involved in a five-year old case in Farrier's Lane.  No matter  how hard Thomas Pitt tries to solve the case by exploring more up-to-date  possibilities, Charlotte continues to be preoccupied with a murder and  crucifixion in Farrier's Lane.  Ugly motives like anti-Semitism and the  rush to judgement eventually disclose the murderer of Judge Stafford and  the miscarriage of justice that happened five years earlier.	2000-07-18

One day, you go to the doctor and your whole life changes--forever.  That's  what it's like to be diagnosed with an ICI (MS, Lupus, thyroid conditions,  Lyme Disease, etc.), and it can be an awfully difficult experience.  The  authors of this book have tried to put together some coping skills and have  identified common responses to having one of these conditions, based on  their own medical situation (both have ICI conditions) and their  professional expertise as psychologists.<br />The real purpose of this book is  to help people whose conditions are &quot;invisible,&quot; and therefore  ignored or underplayed in their daily lives and relationships.  I would  imagine that anyone who has an ICI has experienced at least once the  &quot;You're sick?  You look all pink and healthy!&quot; comment from a  well-meaning friend.  Actually, it's your medication, your lupus rash, or a  chronic fever that gives you that oh-so-rosy glow.  If this has ever  happened to you or to a loved one, you will get a lot out of reading this  book and realizing that you're not alone and that there are ways of coping  with your condition.	2000-07-10

In addition, the main clue  of the mystery is one of the &quot;eye portraits&quot; fashionable in the  late 18th century.  When an eye portrait is found on the dead body at the  center of the mystery, Jane turns her attention into discovering whose  &quot;wandering eye&quot; this is.<br />If you enjoy Jane Austen and are fully  cognizant that Stephanie Barron is not and can never be Jane Austen, you  should give this series of mysteries a try.  They are very entertaining,  extremely well-written for a historical mystery (except the liberal  sprinkling of footnotes which I still find annoying), and provide an  interesting first-person narrative (because the mystery consists of Jane's  journal entries).	2000-07-07

It has wonderful  sections on treating arthritis with drugs, rest, exercise, and diet as well  as detailed descriptions of each of the arthritic conditions and their  treatments.<br />The only downside of this book is that it was printed in  1995, so there is no information about new treatments such as Enbrel.   Still, if you have some form of arthritis this would be a good book to  purchase for your reference shelf.	2000-07-06

Though not as detailed and complete as Starlanyl and Copeland's  Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome, it is also less  overwhelming and so is particularly good for someone who is feeling  overwhelmed, doesn't like a lot of medical information, or has a mild form  of the disease.  The chapters &quot;You aren't alone&quot;, &quot;Making  Lifestyle adjustments,&quot; and &quot;Practical helps for specific  problems&quot; are quite good, as are the three chapters on managing  fatigue, stress, and flareups.	2000-07-05

I bought this book because of its detailed rating system (two scales:  one for quality  and one for value)and because of its detailed coverage of scores of ships  and cruise lines.  I'm glad I did, even though it still doesn't include  everything I'd like to know (one of these days someone will write a cruise  guide that includes sample floor plans and relative sizes of different  classes of cabin--but it hasn't happened yet!).<br />I personally found this  guide to be helpful even though I would qualify as both an experienced  cruiser and a devoted internet searcher (see review below).  It has very  good information on how and why you might want to figure out your own air  transportation, which cruises are for you and which aren't, and is pretty  accurate in summing up cruise ship ambience.  I particularly enjoyed the  &quot;This cruise recommended for...&quot; and &quot;This cruise not  recommended for...&quot; sections, which really help you to narrow your  list down to precisely those ships that offer what you want--even if you  want a luxurious but not stuffy sports minded cruise without  waterslides!<br />I wish it had had an index, and I found some of its Cunard  Line information inaccurate, but even still I am glad to have this book on  my travel reference shelf.	2000-07-04

Despite the best efforts of her friends private  detective William Monk and lawyer Oliver Rathbone,  she is put on trial in  Scotland.  You will enjoy following the twists and turns in this  19th-century &quot;Law and Order&quot;-type mystery as the skilled Anne  Perry takes you from investigations to trial procedures without ever  missing a beat or hitting a false note.  <br />Perry's Monk mysteries are a  bit darker and more psychologically thrilling than her more well-known Pitt  series of mysteries, but devoted fans of the Pitts will recognize the  skilled plot and character developments, the labrynthine twists and turns  of the investigations, and the focus on scandals and secrets.	2000-07-02

In this installment of the Amelia Peabody mysteries, we begin with the Emersons settling into comfortable married life with their young son &quot;Ramses&quot; and their newest charge, Nefret.  It is time for the  winter's archaeological season, and Amelia is determined to leave the  children at home  with their Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Walter and rekindle some  of their earlier marital excitement in the hot sands of Egypt.  All it  takes is their first night at Shepheard's (their habitual Cairo hotel), the  reappearance of old friends and enemies, and a freak accident to do just  that!<br />While this is not the best book in the series, it is certainly full  of the humor, romance, astonishing British sense of superiority, and  archaeological suspense that are the hallmarks of the series.  I personally  think that Ramses is such a hoot that he is one of the best characters in  the books, so his being left at home was a slight detriment in my opinion.   However, I am sure that the next book in the series will see Ramses and  Nefret back in action again!	2000-07-02

As with all Perry mysteries in the series it begins with the discovery of a body:  the  body of William Weems, a moneylender.  Pitt is asked to investigate the  case--even though it is out of the Bow Street jurisdiction--by his boss,  Micah Drummond.  As Pitt gets to the bottom of the mystery we meet with  secret societies, suicide, parliamentary politics, and many secrets.  There  is a good balance in this book between Charlotte and Thomas, and the  supporting character who rises to the top of the story is Micah Drummond.   <br />I was completely baffled regarding motivations until the very last page,  when the murderer of Weems was finally revealed.  This is an engaging and  exciting mystery that you won't be able to put down!	2000-07-02

Dedicated  readers of the Pitt series know Charlotte, Emily, Thomas, and Great Aunt  Vespasia so well now that new characters are always welcome additions to  the cast.<br />In this story Pitt is called in to investigate a mysterious  fire and death in Highgate, a prosperous northern suburb of London.  While  most London policemen are investigating the Jack the Ripper murders at  Whitechapel, Pitt must get to the botom of how and why the Shaw house was  set ablaze and whether the intended victim was really Clemency Shaw, a  modest woman involved in social reform, or her husband Dr. Shaw.<br />The  ending of this mystery was not really up to Perry's usual standards.  I was  pretty sure who had done the deed from the beginning, but as usual Perry  provided some excellent and suprising insights into the other secrets  lurking on Highgate Rise.	2000-06-17

In this engaging mystery Amelia Peabody Emerson, her husband Radcliffe, and their son &quot;Ramses&quot; journey once more to Egypt in search of artifacts and adventure, armed with a mysterious map and a commission from  an English aristocrat to search for his long lost son and his wife.  As in  all Peabody mysteries, these goals intertwine with complexity and  speed.<br />Elizabeth Peters here gives a nod to the romantic adventure  stories of the late nineteenth century (such as She, by Rider Haggard) when  the Peabody-Emerson caravan begins to suffer from the mysterious deaths of  their camels.  When all looks dark and desperate, the group are rescued and  whisked off to a fabulous Shangrila where the ancient rites of Egypt are  still practiced.  By the end the Emerson's have solved the mystery of the  missing nobleman and his wife, have amassed quite a collection of artifacts  for study, and Ramses is suffering from a bad case of puppy love for  Nefret, who returns with them to England.<br />This is the first story to  feature Nefret, and fans of the later books will like to read how she  enters the story.  If you enjoyed Romancing the Stone (a similar tale with  elements of late 19th century adventure) and have never tried the Amelia  Peabody mysteries, this would be a great place to start!	2000-06-17

You get lots of  phrases like &quot;in the second half of the 17th century&quot; which give  you a fair amount of guesswork.

I tried to file, spent $$ on a file cabinet, which sat empty while various things sat on top of it.  I  have a daily planner, which really works (when I remember to use it).  If  this sounds like you, you might really benefit from this book.<br />I got this  book as a companion to the much more left-brained Julie Morgenstern's  Organizing from the Inside Out.  They are, for me, the perfect companions.   Morgenstern helps me to figure out why things aren't working, but Silber is  better (for me) at helping me to figure out how I can make my life more  efficient and productive.<br />Silber's approach is based on some very useful  quizzes, which help you to see the weaknesses and incompatibilities in your  own organizational strategy.  This enables you to create your own  personalized, individual time management plan.  I would estimate that the  chapter &quot;Timing is Everything&quot; saves me about 2 hours of needless  wandering around a week (grocery shopping on Tuesday or Wednesday really  works).  Tickler files (both daily and monthly) have transformed my life:   I no longer lose bills, important pieces of paper, or track of things I  want to do.<br />If other time management systems have failed you, give this  one a try.

I was hooked on Hannah Trevor, the Maine midwife in post-revolutionary times, after the first book, Hearts and Bones.  Not only  did Margaret Lawrence capture with compassion and accuracy the life  experiences of a midwife in the wilderness, she managed to construct a  fairly suspenseful mystery.  While Hearts and Bones was as good as any Anne  Perry novel, Blood Red Roses is simply magnificent in plot, detail, and  narrative.<br />In this second book Hannah discovers the fate of the husband  she has long thought dead.  This brings her into the eye of the storm in  Rufford, and the simmering animosities of the community are directed at  her.  There are also developments in the life of her deaf and mute daughter  Jennet, and in her passion for Ralph Josselin, a married landowner.  For  anyone who has ever loved deeply this book is just riveting since you can  feel Hannah's bottled-up feelings bursting from every page.  A taut,  satisfying, and mystifying sequel.	2000-06-08

And now that the complete  set is bound in one volume, you won't even have to pause to get the next  book:  you'll just be able to jump from one superb story to the next.<br />All  of the fantasies have to do with the royal family in a parallel universe of  Amber.

The salads are equally impressive, especially  the Warm Mushroom Spinach Salad which always wins great praise at dinner  parties.  Many of the main courses require demi-glace (kind of a pain) but  the Chicken and Mushrooms in Marsala-Sage Sauce is excellent, as is the  Rosemary-Mustard London Broil with Wild Mushroom Glaze.  In desserts the  Apple-Cranberry Deep-dish Streusel Pie has become a Thanksgiving tradition,  and the Milk Chocolate Cream Pie will please all chocolate lovers, kids,  and kids at heart.<br />I don't think you will be disappointed if you buy this  book, but will turn to it again and again.	2000-06-08

It is a beautiful walk through the history of needlecrafting from the Renaissance (mainly in  England), and it has beautiful pictures and an engaging text.  The reader  will have a better understanding of how the needlearts effected all aspects  of material culture in the periods considered.  Here needlework is treated  as a long continuum of women's interests and knowledge, along with the  variations that made eachperiod unique.  Great for history buffs, too!	2000-06-08

No matter how many historical mysteries you read you will not be able to get through this book in a day, or even several days.  <br />That being said,  it is one of the most rewarding mysteries you are likely to read.  Pears's  incredibly detailed depiction of Oxford in the late seventeenth century  bristles with life, lust, and treachery.  First through the eyes of a  wandering Italian Marco da Cola, and then through the eyes of other major  figures like John Wallis and Anthony Wood, we are introduced to the strange  events surrounding an even stranger person:  Sarah Blundy.  The history of  science and medicine is very accurate and very well-treated (not always the  same thing!), especially in the sections on Wallis and Wood.  The pace of  the book does pick up the deeper we get into the twisting paths of Oxford  life and legend, but I don't think that makes the first two accounts any  less riveting.  Instead, it brings home how different people see the same  events, and makes us evaluate more critically every &quot;fact&quot; we  think we know.<br />This would be a great book to take on a one-week vacation,  since it will probably get you through the whole thing without having to  take 6 books with you.  If you like historical mysteries or historical  fiction, or even the history of medicine, I highly recommend this book to  you.  <br />PS.  The ending knocks you off your feet.  Totally unexpected!	2000-06-08

I have cooked dozens of recipes from it, and they are all raves.  My copy is so stained, used, and worn out that I think I have to buy a new one.<br />Barbara Tropp does not  cook &quot;traditional&quot; Chinese food, so if that's what you're looking  for you will be disappointed.  Also, her recipes are not for a cook in a  hurry, or the faint of heart.  LONG ingredient lists and exacting standards  for everything from green onion rings to chopped ginger take a while to get  used to.  But, it is really worth the effort.  In no time you will find  yourself whipping up batches of flavored oils and making some truly  fabulous food.  <br />Some of my favorite recipes include the Cold Chicken  Salad with Mustard and Pine Nuts (her method for &quot;No-Poach  Chicken&quot; is now the only method I use when making chicken salads),  Stir-Fried Curried Chicken Slivers with Onions, Tomatoes, and Eggplant (a  really yummy Chinese style curry), Gold Coin Salmon Cakes (people beg me to  make these for them), Stir-Fried Scallops with Summer Squashes and Thai  Basil (a nice fusion dish that's perfect for summer entertaining), Steamed  Buns with Chicken and Oyster Sauce Stuffing (native Chinese friends  describe these as the best steamed buns they've ever had!), and the Light  Style Peanut Lime Noodles.  The desserts are also fabulous, especially her  signature tarts and tiny bite-size cookies like Lemon Ginger  Shorbread.<br />As you can tell from the above list Barbara Tropp is the Queen  of Asian-California Fusion and with good reason.  You will enjoy and learn  a lot if you buy this book	2000-06-08

While I would recommend reading the series in order for maximum enjoyment, the characters are at a turning point in this book and so you  could just jump in here if you wish.  Charlotte Ellison Pitt is really  getting comfortable in her role as a police Inspector's wife; Thomas Pitt,  her husband, has a more sympathetic and appreciative new boss; Emily  Ellison March (Charlotte's sister) just married for a second time; and Aunt  Vespasia is starting to show alarming new signs of frailty and age.   Together, Thomas, Charlotte and Vespasia work together to solve the mystery  of the &quot;Westminster Cutthroat&quot; who is murdering MPs on  Westminster Bridge.<br />What I most liked about this mystery was the number  of red herrings that were thrown in the way of the conclusion.  I found  myself unable to figure out who had perpetrated the crimes and went down  lots of blind alleys as a result.  This added to my enjoyment of the book,  although the ending was a bit Christie-like in all honesty.  I'm really  looking forward to Highgate Rise, the next book in the series, since  Bethlehem Road sets up so many interesting new possibilities.	2000-06-08

Parker takes one of the  central tasks expected of women in the 18th and 19th centuries and shows  how women used needlework as an outlet to express feelings of dismay and  dislike.  It just goes to show you:  where there's a will, there's a  way.<br />If you enjoy learning about women's lives in the past, and have  either an interest or an aversion to needlework yourself, I think you will  enjoy this most unusual history.	2000-06-08

Set at the turn of the century, Peters has a great eye for period detail, a good knowledge of  Egyptology and Egypt, and a marvelous sense of humour.<br />In this mystery  the action is centered around a mummy and a murder victim--both in the  British Museum.  Radcliffe Emerson is furiously working on his manuscript  (under deadline), Ramses is struggling to maintain his composure with two  young cousins who are staying for a visit, and Amelia is (as always)  writing an academic paper, struggling to control her son, and alternately  fending off and succumbing to her husbands amorous advances.  However, the  whole family soon gets involved in trying to find out more about the  mysterious mummy and the Egyptian priest who appears and disappears with  alarming frequency.<br />I found this mystery a nice change of pace with its  different setting and different cast of characters.  I particularly liked  the introduction of a wonderful butler named Gargery, who relishes every  opportunity to get involved in the Emerson family's many escapades.  If  you're going to England in the near future and the British Museum is on  your list of sights to see, be sure to take this book along.  I think that  you will enjoy seeing how little the interior of that august institution  has changed!	2000-06-08

I have about 19 needlepoint books, but this is the one I go back to again and again.  For those of you who have only worked with kits and lusted after the VERY EXPENSIVE Elizabeth Bradley kits, this is  the way to go.  If you are a cross-stitcher, the added plus is that Bradley  advocates a cross-stitch because it makes the cushions more durable, it  doesn't distort the canvas, and it's what many Victorian needleworkers  did.<br />Elizabeth Bradley patterns are great to take with you on holidays,  because you don't need a frame (as long as you use cross-stitch).  The  colors are beautiful, soft &quot;Antique&quot; English colors.  Many of the  patterns have a striking black background, and she gives guidance regarding  color substitutions (both the sage green and pale blue work well).  I've  done a number of the patterns, and whenever I'm making a gift I do  something from this book.<br />As the title suggests, the patterns are floral  but there is a great deal of variety from striking lilies to Victorian  wreaths.	2000-06-07

If you want the best, most detailed, and most wide-ranging book on home care this book is for you.  I think it would make a great gift for a first-time home owner, or for a wedding present (perhaps  accompanied by some of the cooking or cleaning tools the author  recommends).<br />I grew up in a fanatically neat house, but because Mom was  so hysterical about keeping it clean (especially vacuuming), I became a  slob.  I ignored how my mother cleaned, and therefore have only rudimentary  (and it turns out wrong!) cleaning skills.  Reaction formation, no doubt,  but now that I have a home of my own my ideas about cleanliness have  changed, in large part because I want the house to be restful, soothing,  and welcoming.<br />Enter this book.  I just cleaned my fridge like it's  never been cleaned before, got out some very stubborn stains that have  resisted every cleaner on the market, and set up a housekeeping routine  that just might work.<br />For those of you who are groaning, fear not.  There are great sections on how to outfit a kitchen with everything you  need, what should be in your pantry, and how to select carpeting.<br />I  highly recommend this book.  You probably won't read it cover to cover in  one sitting, but if you keep it on a shelf in your kitchen you will find  yourself turning to it again and again for really good, sound advice.	2000-06-07

Month-by-month the  author tells us what all gardeners should be doing, then has specific  recommendations for Central Valley, Mountain, and Coastal gardeners.  Each  month also includes great advice on pest control (she favors gentle  methods), planting, pruning, and what is usually available at local  nurseries.<br />This guide is especially good for people who are new to  Northern CA, and are in garden shock.

The plates and illustrations are  beautifully reproduced, and I did not find that they were insufficiently  linked to the text.  In fact, I found that after reading the text I could  look at the illustrations for a long time, seeing more and more detail that  I know would have passed me by without the text.<br />The emphasis in this  book is on the history of the tulip, something that I find really  fascinating.  From its beginnings in the Ottoman empire through its  introduction to western gardens, the bacteria that led to the famous  &quot;breaks&quot; in tulip coloration and then tulip mania, this book is a  delightful, entertaining and very informative read.	2000-06-07

The  designs are detailed, and the charts are detailed, and the canvas is  usually smaller than, say, Elizabeth Bradley.  For those needlepointers  with some experience, however, you will enjoy the challenge of translating  these beautiful Morris-inspired designs into art for your home.  <br />Some of  the best I've done include the Morris Lion (a wonderful medieval-looking  lion with an ornate tapestry background), the orange pillow (on the cover),  and the woodpecker tapestry	2000-06-07

I was introduced to the Lymond series by my undergraduate honors thesis advisor.  Wisely, she didn't tell me about them until I was finished.  I spent the next month travelling on business and frantically searching for  the next book in the series in cities from Denver to Albuquerque.   <br />Dorothy Dunnet's Lymond series is simply the best, most accurate, most  evocative, and most satisfying series of novels ever set in the 16th  century.  I'm a historian of 16th-century Europe, and most books and novels  about the period frankly make my hair stand on end because they are so  inaccurate.  These books are a pleasant exception, where every detail and  characterization rings completely true.<br />Now, don't worry.  Reading these  books is REALLY enjoyable.  You will fall in love with Lymond,and agonize  with him during his many adventures.  You will be able to stun and amaze  your friends with your encyclopedic command of 16th-century European  military tactics and fashion, but it will be a painless process.  <br />I  recommend this series to anyone who is looking for the perfect summer  escape--just make sure you have 1-Click turned on because the first book  will not be enough!	2000-06-06

In the 1990s science fiction and alternative history writers also caught on, and the result is this  marvelous book!  Newton's Cannon is the first book in the series, and I  would highly recommend you start here and read them in order for maximum  enjoyment.<br />The book's premise is this:  imagine Newton followed his two  great passions (alchemy and physics), but that alchemy proved to be the  winner!  In Newton's Cannon you will enter a world that conveys the magic  and promise of Sir Isaac's interest in alchemy, and transforms alchemy from  a lamentable failure in the history of science to a prime mover in the  history of civilization.  Alchemy provides Newton and his followers with  all sorts of magical-scientific tools (my favorite is the aether-schrieber)  that change the course of history.  As with most scientific developments,  these stunning achievements have a dark side--the Cannon of the title--and  this book moves the reader effortlessly from the Colonies and Benjamin  Franklin to the England of the Royal Society and beyond.<br />If you enjoy the  history of science, sci-fi, fantasy, and alternative histories you will  love this book.  If you are interested in alchemy you will also love this  book.  Highly enjoyable!	2000-06-06

Now that it's summer and the Antiques Roadshow is in reruns, loyal viewers might need a change of pace.  This is the perfect book to take along with you to the Brimfield Flea Market, or on vacation (with the requisite  antique shop stops, of course).  Why?  Because this book gives you the  inside scoop on many of your favorite appraisers on the Roadshow, and gives  you a great insight into the behind-the-podium world of antiques  dealers.<br />Some of the best bits have to do with the Keno brothers, Leslie  and Leigh.  They began their career in the antiques trade at age 7 (!) when  they started selling stoneware they dug up around their house.  At age 13  they went to Brimfield, where Leigh had a hizzy fit after a stoneware jug  he asked the dealer to hold for him was sold.  You can also find out more  about Barbara Deisroth (you know, the lady who never, ever, pays attention  to a Tiffany signature).  Other Roadshow Regulars appear as well, and you  will never be able to look at any of the appraisers in the same way  again.<br />If you like the Roadshow and antiquing, you will enjoy this book a  great deal.  Highly recommended for summertime (or any time!) reading.	2000-06-06

A Sudden, Fearful Death is the fourth mystery in the Inspector Monk series of books by Anne Perry.  Better known for her Pitt series, the Inspector Monk series are slighly earlier (just after the Crimean War), grittier, and  in many ways more riveting.  They are longer than the average Pitt novel,  and this allows the author's wonderful ability to convey period detail and  characterization to shine through.<br />In this mystery Inspector Monk is  called in to investigate the murder of one of Florence Nightingale's  Crimean nurses, who is working at a London hospital.  Those of you who have  read the previous three novels know how hard it can be for these young  women to adapt to English hospitals after their stint abroad, and at first  it seems that Prudence Barrymore might be a victim because of her desire to  reform the medical system.  As the plot unfolds, however, we realize that  there is a great deal more going on at London's Royal Free hospital than  meets the eye.  <br />One of Perry's greatest talents lies in character  development, and she is always careful to let a different character feature  prominently in each novel.  This time it is Lady Callandra Daviot's turn,  Inspector Monk's female patron, who emerges as a more three-dimensional  character.  Hester Latterly, another Nightingale nurse, is also featured,  along with the brilliant Inspector Monk and the lawyer of lawyers, Oliver  Rathbone.<br />I would particularly recommend the Monk series to fans of TV's  Law and Order, since these mysteries combine excellent sleuthing with taut  court-room drama.  If you like historical mysteries, you will love this  series.  If you already like Anne Perry, I encourage you to give Inpsector  Monk a try!	2000-06-05

When Thomas Pitt is asked by his  superiors to open a three-year old unsolved mystery, he has no idea that he  will put his family--and himself--in so much danger.  It is Emily and her  great-aunt Vespasia who finally save the day (and Thomas!).<br />Silence in  Hanover Close is one of the best books in the series because here we get to  see Emily FINALLY get a clue as to how hard life is for the rest of London.   I took a great deal of satisfaction in Emily's new recognition of how hard  it was to iron perfect ruffles, and learned how to cut and butter paper  thin slices of bread for tea (try the method in the book--it really works,  and then you can have your friends over for a book discussion complete with  English cucumber sandwiches).

In the days of modern air travel they would be the family you  hated to have any where near you on the plane; in turn of the century  Cairo, you wouldn't have wanted to get near them either!  For wherever they  go, murder, mayhem, and the Master Criminal cannot be far behind.<br />I loved  the Mummy Case because we got to know Ramses who provided some leavening  into the already hysterical antics of Amelia and Radcliffe.  As he lisped  about in the sand discovering priceless relics and running rings around his  parents, the reader realized that he was going to be a great addition to  the series.  Here in Lion in the Valley, Ramses really comes into his own.   Now 7, he is twice the trouble and twice the detective.<br />The plot hinges  on the actions of the &quot;Master Criminal&quot;--a mastermind of devious  and deadly plots who is organizing the grave robbers of Egypt into a  formidable criminal underworld.  We briefly met the MC in the Mummy Case,  but here he takes center stage, pushing aside any hope of interest in the  archaeological dig itself.  By the end of the book Amelia and the MC have  met...and it is hilarious.<br />If you like your mysteries with a laugh track  then this is for you.  Fans read them for Amelia and the 101 things she can  do with waterproof matches--not for the labrynthine plots--and increasingly  for Ramses as well.	2000-06-05

The charred remains of a letter  from her brother persuade Narcissa that there is more to his death than  meets the eye.  Through the story we are introduced to the  &quot;resurrection men&quot; of Richmond who procure corpses for the  medical school, a black conjure woman named Judah, and the character of  ante-bellum Richmond society on the eve of war.<br />As with most historical  mysteries, the plot is not completely surprising (one major exception here  is the Margaret Lawrence mysteries set in Revolutionary Maine which leave  you gasping) but does have interesting twists and turns.  For most  historical mystery buffs, the characterizations are the thing and this  novel introduces us to some fascinating and complex figures.  As for the  historical detail all mysteries leave a lot to be desired in this  department--but most US readers know more about the American Civil War than  they do about 19th-century London or Medieval England, so perhaps the  author's flights of fancy are more glaring.  Still, McMillan is accurate  about 97% of the time, which is more than most!	2000-06-05

Some of my favorites include Shrimp Thiyal  (yummy coconut-shrimp curry), Lamb Korma (admittedly a Mughal dish, and you  can easily substitute chicken), and the spinach Dhal (green split peas with  spinach and flakes of coconut).	2000-05-31
US	52667868	R3TGFU2HWJDPIU	0553110934	237994876	O Jerusalem	Books	3	7	11	N	N	O Dear!	I LOVED the first two books of the Mary Russell-Sherlock Holmes series.  I didn't like the third (A Letter from Mary) but things were looking up in #4 (The Moor), despite the fact that it was the Hound of the Baskervilles II.   But try as I might I simply cannot get engrossed in this book!<br />O  Jerusalem takes place chronologically in the midst of the first book, The  Beekeeper's Apprentice, when Russell and Holmes were still in the process  of getting to know each other.  To protect themselves, the two go off to  Palestine with the assistance of Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft.  In  Palestine, Russell and Holmes meet several British spies, encounter the  Holy Land, and solve some dark political problems.<br />Russell is occupied  during most of the novel either deploring the dirt and smells or fighting  for respect from their two closest companions, Mahmoud and Ali.  The whole  thing left me cold, and I am not encouraged that the forthcoming book in  the series is more of the same.	2000-05-31

You might think that a confession in the first few chapters of a mystery novel would be a bad idea.  Why keep reading?  Anne Perry proves she knows best once again in this, the third novel in the William Monk series.  Here  we read on page after exciting page because we want to know WHY Alexandra  Carlyon would murder her husband, Thaddeus.<br />Fans of Anne Perry know that  the author is fascinated with secrets, who keeps them, and why.  Because  this book focuses on disclosures in Alexandra Carlyon's murder trial,  rather than a murder investigation per se, we are able to follow each  labrynthine path that the author lays down.  Did Alexandra murder her  husband because of jealousy?  Because she was in love with someone else?   Or to protect someone she loved?<br />This book is gripping and intriguing--a  real page-turner.  If you like Victorian mysteries and the modern TV series  Law and Order you will love this book.  Part detective work, part legal  work, the case will keep you guessing!	2000-05-29

In this tale Jane and her family visit Lyme for a restful time by the sea.  Before they reach the town, however, the  Austens are beset by storms and forced to take refuge in the house of the  secretive but arresting Mr. Sidmouth.  After reaching Lyme, Jane is soon  woken to the sight of a gibbet erected on Lyme's Cobb (think of the French  Lieutenant's Woman!).  Rest Jane does not get, but there are hints of  romance, smuggling, and the aftermath of the French Revolution to keep the  reader entertained.<br />I personally found the mystery slightly more engaging  than that in Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor, which I found  completely predictable.  This plot did not surprise, but it did go down  some surprising blind alleys on the way to its conclusion.  <br />I would  recommend this book to anyone travelling to  England on a plane, to someone  vacationing by the sea for good recreational reading, and to people fond of  Jane Austen.  (I just wish the author would stop footnoting her novels! )	2000-05-28
US	52667868	RZ8CY6OFRDNFP	0446601934	922692393	The Mummy Case	Books	5	71	72	N	N	A great read--and you get to know &quot;Ramses&quot; Emerson!	The Mummy Case is the third in the series of Amelia Peabody mysteries, which are set in turn-of-the-century Egypt and England.  Amelia is a staunch believer in the superiority of all things British, and her husband  is an archaeologist with a mission (namely to save the antiquities of Egypt  from the clutches of untrained archaeologists and unscrupulous antiquities  dealers).  All of the Peabody mysteries are tongue-in-cheek tributes to the  mystery genre in general and English female detectives in particular.<br />The  Mummy Case is the most enjoyable of the first three mysteries, in large  part because we get to know the Emersons's four-year old enfant  terrible--Walter Peabody Emerson, nicknamed &quot;Ramses.&quot;  Ramses  already knows Coptic, Arabic, German, French, and the modern methods of  archaeology.  While his parents stumble about trying to find out how the  death of a Cairo antiquities dealer is related to the mummy case of a  German baroness and a village torn between an evangelical American  missionary and the ancient Coptic church, Ramses quietly goes about solving  the puzzle before either one of them.<br />Ramses is a fantastic addition to  the Emerson family, and only increases the reader's enjoyment.  The  mysteries are not the main thing in these books; the development of highly  individualistic characters is.	2000-05-26

It's enjoyable!	Now that my videos of Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion are beginning to show signs of wear, I was delighted to discover this series of Jane Austen mysteries by Stephanie Barron.  I opened the first in the  series, Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor, with curiousity and  a bit of trepidation.  Who, after all, can really recapture Austen's superb  sense of character and language?<br />Stephanie Barron comes pretty close!   She has obviously steeped herself in the language of Austen, and in the  history of that period.  As a result, she is able to craft a completely  plausible mystery for Jane to solve.<br />The only thing I didn't like was the  author's decision to use footnotes to explain things in the text that we  modern readers might miss.  I found this VERY distracting, and finally  learned to ignore them.  I hope that in time Ms. Barron learns to explain  the terms within the text and leaves off this practice.	2000-05-26

In the first mystery in the Pitt series, the Ellison family lost a daughter to the Cater Street Hangman.  Since that time friends have suffered unspeakable tragedies, and now Emily Ellison March, Lady Ashworth,  is suspected of murdering her husband George by putting belladonna in his  morning coffee.  Families with this kind of luck need to have someone  married to a police detective!<br />If you are reading the stories  chronologically, you will have followed the relationship of George and  Emily through several novels.  While I was initially sad to think his  good-natured presence would be missing from future stories, I have to  confess that there was little spark between the two.  Maybe a change of  pace is what Emily (and Perry's loyal readers?) need.<br />Charlotte (Emily's  sister) and Thomas Pitt continue to develop as characters and sleuths in  this story.  Charlotte is even beginning to learn a bit of judicious  caution and investigative skills!  While the solution to the mystery was  not entirely surprising, the twists and turns of the plot take the reader  into some interesting and unforgettable aspects of late Victorian England.   I highly recommend this book, and even if this is the first one you read  you will enjoy getting to know the characters.	2000-05-26

Remember Eleanor Lavish during the picture, proclaiming the benefits  of Mackintosh Squares?  Or her descriptions of Florence to Charlotte  Bartlett?  If you found Eleanor Lavish entertaining, you will LOVE Amelia  Peabody.<br />Armed with a parasol, a first-aid kit, and a formidable  confidence in the superiority of the British Empire and its cultural  conventions, Amelia Peabody sets out for an adventure in Egypt.  On her  way, she rescues a fainting Englishwoman, hires a dahabeeyah to take her  down the Nile to view archaeological remains, and meets the Emerson  brothers.  While Walter Emerson falls for our fainting Englishwoman, his  older brother Radcliffe Emerson--as curmudgeonly as Amelia--begins to do  battle for control of his archaeological site.  His rival?   Parasol-wielding Amelia Peabody, of course.<br />The plot, as other reviewers  suggest, is purely secondary to the characters--especially Amelia.  If you  want to learn a little about Egypt and in the process solve a completely  unsurprising mystery then you can have no better companion than the  forthright Amelia Peabody.  How many mysteries make you laugh out-loud at  the antics of the heroine?	2000-05-25

Two words of warning, however:  there is not a  huge amount of variety in the food presented here (you will still need to  go to the restaurant to get many favorites and many Thai standards), and  while the glossary was a great idea, the descriptions are confusing and not  all of the Thai ingredients that mystify are explained in the glossary.	2000-05-24

Her experiences, and those of her fellow citizens in Rufford, Maine, open your eyes to the  horrors that walked beside the patriotism of the War for Independence.  I  finished Hearts and Bones with a deep desire to learn more about the darker  side of freedom, as well as a need to read the next book in the  series!<br />Lawrence undoubtedly drew on Laurel Ulrich's Pulitzer-prize  winning A Midwife's Tale for her heroine (a debt not acknowledged until the  third book in the series), but there is much more here than a fictional  parroting of Ulrich's Martha Ballard. Hannah Trevor takes more risks than  Martha, but is still a product of her own time who finds comfort in the  geometrical precision of quilting and attends dissections led by the inept  town surgeon.  Hannah Trevor lives in an unsentimental world where death  and terror are part of everyone's experience, and Lawrence makes no effort  to soften the blow of those experiences for the reader.<br />The rape and  murder of a young woman in town sets the story's plot in motion, and Hannah  (the de facto obstetrical and gynecological expert in town) is involved in  the analysis of what happened to the woman and who did such a heinous thing  to her.  But Hannah's efforts to discover the truth are not always  appreciated in Rufford.  She is the wife of an English sympathizer, who has  disappeared and is believed dead.  She has a deaf and mute daughter who  bears a striking resemblance to a local, married landowner.  And, although  this is not emphasized, she has a great deal more power and autonomy than  many people in Rufford find comfortable.  As Hannah gets closer to the  truth, Rufford turns ugly with accusations, counter-accusations, and the  bitterness following war and sacrifice.  As a reader, I left the story awed  by Hannah's strength, hurt by her own pain and fears, and sympathetic  regarding her great love for a man who cannot be hers.	2000-05-23

Strong and wounded, fearful and brave,  she is a walking bundle of contradictions, anger, and tenderness.<br />Reading  one of Margaret Lawrence's novels about Trevor is like taking a long walk  in an 18th century Maine midwife's shoes.  The walk is not always pleasant,  but it is always rewarding and fascinating.  In this second novel, we begin  by learning the fate of Hannah's long-gone husband James Trevor, a British  sympathizer in the War for Independence.  This news shocks Rufford to its  core, and stirs up the barely controlled anger of the community.  The news  of James is accompanied by the gruesome murder of a poor family, and soon  Hannah Trevor is the leading suspect.  It is only with the help of her  lover, Daniel Josselyn, that Hannah is exonerated from the suspicion that  she is a murderer.<br />Lawrence knows her subject well, and conveys it with a  passion and feeling that are remarkable.  I  wept and I rejoiced with  Hannah during this novel, which I literally could not put down.  Treat  yourself to a wonderful weekend with this extraordinary midwife--you will  not be disappointed.	2000-05-23

True, Inspector Monk is not  as likeable as Pitt and the stories are set in a slightly earlier period.   But the stories!  The characters!  They are simply superb.<br />In this second  book of the series, Perry uses her considerable skills as a writer and her  fascination with the secrets people keep to great advantage in getting to  the bottom of the death of Octavia Haslett, a young widow.  In his efforts  Inspector Monk is assisted by Hester Latterly, one of Florence  Nightingale's Crimean nurses.  We are also introduced to another marvelous  character, Oliver Rathbone--a brilliant litigator and trial attorney.  As  Monk deciphers the meagre clues available to him he realizes that the  murderer of Mrs. Haslett lived in her house, and may strike again.  All  fingers begin to point to a unlikeable footman, but Monk believes he has  been framed and refuses to act on the instructions of Runcorn, his  supervisor, who wants the case wrapped up due to pressure from the social  and political elite who cannot abide the suggestion that one of their own  might have committed the murder.  Runcorn is certainly the boss no one  would want to have, and in his fury he fires Monk who is forced to rely on  the recently unemployed and also very outspoken Nurse Latterly to  infiltrate Mrs. Haslett's home and find out the secrets within.  By the end  of the story Monk and Latterly are on different paths--Monk is heading up a  private detective agency, and Latterly is serving as a private duty nurse.   On to Defend and Betry to see if their new career paths work out!<br />If you  like Inspector and Charlotte Pitt, give Inspector Monk a try.  The  psychological tautness of these novels is a nice change of pace!	2000-05-23

Initially, I was not sure that I would like  this Anne Perry series because of the initial premise (Monk has had an  accident and cannot remember his own identity or anything about his past  life) nor was I sure I would like a series without Charlotte Ellison Pitt!   I was drawn in immediately by Perry's amazing ability to explore the  secrets that can reside within the most seemingly secure and blameless  households.<br />The Inspector Monk novels (of which this is the first) are  darker and more gritty than the Pitt novels.  There are few veils between  the cruel and dangerous world of mid-century London and the reader, which  gives the novels a faster pace and often more complicated plots.  While  some readers have taken issue with the amnesiatic Inspector Monk, I feel  that his lack of awareness about his own past is a metaphor for the  blindness his social betters are willing inflict upon themselves in order  to keep up appearances.  Monk's desire to KNOW, however, provides an  interesting point of comparison with the people he must investigate who  seem not to want to know anything at all that will make their lives  unpleasant.<br />I have spoken more about character than plot in this review,  and that is largely because Anne Perry's mysteries seem to me to pivot on  their protagonists's characters.  The plot of this novel, and the mysteries  at the center of it, do not disappoint any more than the characters.  As  Monk tries to untangle his own personal mysteries, he is expected to get to  the bottom of a mystery that involves death, financial ruin, and the  closely-guarded secrets of some very proper families.	2000-05-23

As with the first book, the  character developments are as fun as the plot, and add a great deal to the  enjoyment of the book.   If you haven't read The Beekeeper's Apprentice  yet, I would strongly recommend you read that one first.	2000-05-02

Third books always fall flat, as do third movies (see above), In my opinion and A Letter of Mary is no exception.  I read the teaser at the end of Monstrous Regiment and I couldn't wait until I got  the book!  But the historical center of this work--a letter purporting to  have been written on papyrus by Mary of Magdala--which could have been so  exciting and important, I felt was consigned to a lesser role in the plot  development.  The long awaited marriage of Holmes and Mary was also  disappointing.  Mary and Holmes are bored (Mary repeatedly worries about  this), and that lassitude really permeated the book for me.  The character  development that has been so exciting in the series so far is largely  irrelevant here.  My fingers are tightly crossed that the jinx will be  broken in book 4, The Moor...	2000-05-02

I have always disliked mysteries, and had little sympathy for my friends who grabbed every Sue Grafton and PD James when they were published.  I especially dislike Sherlock Holmes.  I got totally hooked on this mystery by accident because it was in a flat I rented in London--and now I'm a Mary  Russell addict!  Mary Russell (the main character) is believable, likeable,  and smart.  As you get deeper into the murky depths of the mystery you care  more and more what happens to her, how her friendship with the aging  Sherlock Holmes is developing.  You even start to like Sherlock Holmes,  since this is a Sherlock Holmes who can be bested by a young woman (at  least occasionally).  This is the first in a series of mystery novels, and  I would recommend beginning here, and reading them in order so that you can  track the character developments.  King writes with a deft style and a  surety that makes the historical details--which can so often sound jarring  in the hands of a less accomplished writer--entirely convincing.  And, you  won't figure this one out before the end!  The twists of the plot keep you  reading and enjoying until the satisfying conclusion of the case.	2000-05-02
