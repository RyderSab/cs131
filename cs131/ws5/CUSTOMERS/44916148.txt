US	44916148	R5K4ST8SWGE4	0962874612	625350837	Accidental Genius	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Could hardly put it down!	Yes, that's right... this was a fascinating story.  And it was easy to read almost non-stop until I had heard it told.  However, the book really does have many shortcomings.  Perhaps just because the story is so fascinating that it raises all sorts of questions that are not addressed here.  Most notably missing is Michael's own view on his childhood.  How could the parents not think of including him in his own story?  His own analysis would be at least as insightful as that of his parents.  Especially since some of the speculation engaged in by the parents is of limited cogency.  Particularly unsettling, in the midst of an already loose and casual narrative style, is the large number of spelling errors or similar proofreading errors that are in the book.  Apparently this small press charges more money but offers less quality in its product.  The story is fascinating and merits a 4 out of 5 rating for its interest alone.  But the parental interpretation could have greatly benefited from editing, proofreading, and supplemental material provided by a third author - either a subject area expert or their \\"whiz kid\\" himself.  Strangely, they refer to Michael's autobiography as if it is a published book somewhere, but web searches have turned up no sign of it.  Nor is it included in the reference section at the back of this book.  This book is fascinating, just as if one could meet directly with the parents and talk with them all day long.  However, it really feels like a draft manuscript, rather than a polished and completed work.  I am grateful it's available, but the story and subject deserved more thorough treatment.	2005-06-24
US	44916148	R1B3S1CTX4SYAF	0761927352	270753878	The 11 Myths of Media Violence	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Lots of great stuff, but still not definitive	The first half of the book is excellent.  I was prepared to give it a full 5 stars as a comprehensive overview of the various effects of media violence (both negative and positive).  But unfortunately, some careless writing sneaks into most of the second half of the book, with subtle exaggerations and various arguments that won't hold up to rigorous scrutiny.  Those exaggerations and arguments are meant to strengthen his criticism of media violence, but unfortunately weaken his strength as an overall authority.  The author has assembled a lot of great information into this book, which may be an ideal starting point for readers new to this topic, but many of his excellent points, arguments, and insights get carried slightly farther than are truly defensible at this time (scientifically, logically, sociologically).  I am still waiting for the definitive book on this topic that I can recommend without reservations to people I know.  This one I would recommend to average readers but not unreservedly to the rigorous thinkers and scholars I am fortunate to count among my friends.  With some editing and a touch more temperance, it could have been.  Ah well, read it and learn what you can.  It's good, but far from the last word on the subject.	2004-09-22

The dialogue was more cleverly done than most and set up an interesting scenario in which Slocum finds himself assisting a woman who's just arrived in Nevada from the east, and gets involved in conflicts involving miners and crooked politics in a 49er-type of boom town.  <br />The book moves right along with non-stop action and nicely contrasting characters, for a very pleasant spell of entertainment.	2004-05-31

For me, this book completely eliminated all the mysteries surrounding auditions, but the book also serves as an important guide for actors to interpret scripts and bring new and complex things into their performances.  We also get to read some really entertaining and informative stories about how such stars as Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Ben Vereen, and Robert DeNiro got their starts.  Definitely the sort of book to be re-read many times!  I would also say that it is an outstanding book to use in class or independent study, for ANYONE involved with drama or film!	2004-03-15

First problem: the actor doing the readings does NOT seem to have gotten very familiar with the monologues before doing this recording.  There are notable slips and pauses while he seems to be interpreting the characters on the spot.  Second problem: The actor seems to be doing precisely what the monologue author has advised us NOT to do - rather than the voices sounding natural, it sounds like the actor has lifted his voice half an octave (because, after all, he's &quot;in character now&quot;, right??) and his expressive efforts frequently interfere with our understanding of the accents themselves.  What we need are multiple readings and interpretations.  Third: the problem is never resolved about the fact that any &quot;dialect&quot; has a whole range of sounds included within it, and that authentic dialects often sound much different from the movie versions most people think of, OR the versions we're offered on this tape.  So the problem is that, having known actual German and Irish and Italian folks... what I have heard from them bears little resemblance to what I hear on this tape.  Sometimes the &quot;stereotyped&quot; accents are much more true to life than what we hear on this tape.  Fourth, the tape includes American dialects: Texan, Chicago, New York, Boston.  Besides my comment above about the range of sounds to be heard within any dialect, it is questionable whether some of these are really reflecting a distinct dialect anymore.  I've lived my whole life in the Milwaukee-Chicago-Detroit-Buffalo dialect zone that the tape describes and I've talked to a lot of people both rural and urban (grew up in Metro Detroit, friends from those three other big cities, and my job regularly takes me to every corner of Michigan), and what we're given as a dialect for my region just doesn't sound familiar at all.  I do nothear it either in my own voice nor anyone I know or can remember meeting.  Even if such a voice exists here somewhere, what's the point of developing a dialect that is so rare it can't even be recognized by natives?  <br />I would consider reading more by the monologue author, who seems to have good advice to give.  But this product is totally sabotaged by the use of one actor giving one take on the monologues, with no specific instruction about the choices he made in doing so, and at the same time seeming to violate some of the fundamental principles of dialect acting that we've just been told about in the accompanying booklet!<BR>I suppose I may possibly get some practical use out of this at some point, MAYBE.  But... on one listen, I'm not enthusiastic and for the price of $20 it was pretty disappointing!	2004-03-10

It's hard to go wrong purchasing this novelization at such an affordable price!  (More than one cover exists for this book, and although the one I own shows the normal movie poster scene, I'm assuming that all versions include color photo inserts in the middle just as my copy does.  One of the photos is from a deleted scene, which is also described in the story.  Hopefully, such deleted scenes will be placed on the DVD release!)	2003-12-28
US	44916148	R3DN54SQE3H2OK	1551641526	83877871	MIND ABUSE	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Wow!	This book is far more grounded and effective than more well known works that criticize modern mass media.  The author takes a multidisciplinary approach to the subject and does a very impressive job, too!  Of great usefulness within the book are the numerous references (government documents, web sites) where you can find more information on the many topics collected together here.  In 200 pages, this book has a lot of information and explanatory prose.  Due to its multidisciplinary nature, many lay readers may find parts of it tricky to understand, and perhaps the book's main flaw is that it takes its readers' academic background for granted sometimes and fails to completely explain all the terms it uses.  Still, this packs in a lot of info into 200 pages.  As for media violence, I'm convinced!  If the book alone doesn't do it for you, feel free to check up on its reference sources.  Besides that, numerous major U.S. health-related associations (psychology, medicine, pediatrics, and others) have now released official statements stating that after long decades of research into the subject of the effects of media violence, an effective consensus has now been reached about the reality of these effects.  In this book, you can read an impressive sampling of the evidence, and the multidisciplinary theory on the subject.  Drawbacks are that extra proofreading was needed, and this book acts more as a starting point to explore the body of existing research, rather than a final word.  Activist intentions of the author also sometimes intrude a bit into its effectiveness as a survey.	2003-11-06
US	44916148	R1WYDMS7KHEYYW	0060262893	66739050	Road to the stars	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Charming science fiction adventure	The year is 2088, and a young man is faced with a decision to attend college on Earth or travel among the stars and thus be separated from everything that he knew.  He finds a way to combine his interests in archeology with his yearning for adventurous space travel, and the result is archeological detective work relating to what may be the first signs of intelligent alien life.  The story is straightforward but convincingly done.  The scenes of Earth in 2088 are compelling, and the space flight is done in a proper science fiction manner... that is, it involves actual science rather than some Buck Rogers sort of fantasy scenario.  An excellent book for young scientists to start into the genre, and a good read for older scientists as well!  This book is character-oriented and very readable.  In fact, I found it so readable I went through it in a single day... I was reluctant to put it down.  I especially loved how each person on the ship was assigned important duties, and thus the young protagonist finds himself teaching an archeology class!  That was excellent!  This is the sort of thing that made the original Star Trek series so appealing...trained people working together so that their combined knowledge can achieve something that humans have never seen or done before.  Inspiring.	2003-02-28
US	44916148	R1RHRXSWALDDNU	0380767252	533410990	Death Channels	Books	4	0	0	N	N	I really enjoyed this book!!!	This is the third in Vardeman's Peter Thorne Mystery series (following The Screaming Knife and The Resonance of Blood) and each book in the series just keeps getting better!  This book retains the thoroughly enjoyable characters from the first two, but in addition, the mystery itself is complicated and engaging, thus making this book a success on every count for the genre.  For those who don't yet know, Peter Thorne is a Houdini-type of character who has magic stage acts, but at the same time assists the local police with murder cases, and debunks the many mediums and psychic shenanigans to be found in the San Francisco area.  This character is one of the most fun I've seen in a long time.  The skeptical approach he takes to the supernatural has a single exception - the fact that Peter Thorne himself has a single psychic ability that he can use to get information from murder weapons.  With that one exception, he doesn't take for granted the existence of any other paranormal events.  Until, perhaps, in this book - for he gets involved in some seances with a friend and seems to be presented with convincing evidence of survival after death!!  Can this evidence hold up to scrutiny, and thus force him to change his skepticism?  The scenario is complex, fascinating in its presentation, and quite surprising in its resolution.  Main drawback in the series is that, following in the tradition of the mystery genre, the books sometimes include many lurid details of crime and horror.	2003-02-28

So far, I have read 8 books in this series, and I think this one is the best of them.  It starts in the midst of a raging blizzard, and the action hardly ever lets up over the next 180 pages.  I won't give away any key plot points, but the hero, Slocum, gets involved in an extensive cave adventure, a Russian duchess, and a small array of villainous and eccentric side characters - one of whom had apparently killed an old friend of his.  The book is an engagingly written, action packed adventure with moody and suspenseful cave exploration sequences, complete with pitfalls and stalking gunmen; wintery outdoor adventure scenes with life-or-death peril; and of course some steamy (!!) encounters with western gals, which are well-placed within the story.  The end result is ideal escapist reading for cold winter days and (especially) nights.  (I'm writing this 2 days after the book's original release at the end of February.)  5.7hrs.	2003-02-28

It is even more timely as more events are seen in which man-made space objects crash to earth.  The intrigue builds very nicely throughout, although the resolution at the end seems a bit too abrupt in comparison to the pacing throughout the rest of the book, thus causing me to mark down a notch from the full 4 star rating.  Characterization is very good here.  It's nice to see scientists as round characters and protagonists in a novel!  Check it out.	2003-02-28

I bought it because of the author, and I was not disappointed.  It has many good elements, although one or two of them did not sit as well with me as the others.  The book has a very strong start, intriguingly presenting numerous characters in diverse settings, then slowly tying them all together.  Most of these characters I found fascinating.  A bit of the middle of the book got a little slow on one of the plot threads, but the ending was pretty strong.  Well worth checking out.  I greatly enjoyed a scientist/scholar character - unusual for a fantasy novel!  The quest for a lost city scenario was really cool!	2003-02-28

I found this entry in the series to be more of a thriller than a traditional mystery and it doesn't succeed quite so well on the latter count.  (The third book \\"Death Channels\\" succeeds on all counts).  Peter Thorne is one of the most enjoyable characters I've come across in quite a while, since he's a Houdini-type of character involved in magic acts but at the same time debunking mediums and the other psychic shenanigans in the San Francisco area.  Oh yes, he also helps local police to solve murders, since he does possess a single psychic ability despite his skepticism on other matters.  This is an entertaining scenario in which the New Age culture of the 60s through 80s can meet the skeptical and scientific scrutiny and responses of the 90s and 00s!  (Readers of the Skeptical Inquirer, Skeptic, and similar mags, take note!!!)  Especially fun is when there's an interlude in which Peter addresses a local skeptic's society.  Yet his own psychic power is genuine, in this fictional scenario.  How he uses it along with his knowledge of magic and escape makes the book a truly entertaining reading experience.  (Also noteworthy is the first book in the series - The Screaming Knife.)  Main drawback is that, following in the tradition of the mystery genre, the books sometimes include many lurid details of crime and horror.<BR>This is particularly true in the climax of this book, and in retrospect, caused me to drop my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars, now that I've realized how such portrayals of violence are not helpful for decent-hearted readers.	2003-02-28

As a mystery, this book has some shortcomings, but I highly recommend reading it anyway because the following books in the series just keep getting better and better.  The fun starts here.  Peter Thorne is a Houdini-like character, knowledgeable about magic and escapes and thus able to debunk the psychic shenanigans present in the San Francisco area.  At the same time, though, he possesses a single psychic ability that enables him to assist local police in solving crimes.  Naturally, he wonders how his psychic ability is possible, and seeks to have it investigated and hopefully explained in rational terms by local researchers at a university.  This series is a breath of much-needed fresh air in an entertainment culture that has gotten outrageous in assuming that the paranormal exists in every possible form.  In contrast, this series is careful to ground itself in known realities and then propose an exception to known reality, thus capturing the essence of what the supernatural is supposed to be about in fiction!  \\"The Resonance of Blood\\" and \\"Death Channels\\" follow in the series...<BR>Main drawback is that, following in the tradition of the mystery genre, the books sometimes include many lurid details of crime and horror.	2003-02-28

This is the 6th book in the \\"Swords of Raemllyn\\" series.  Like previous books in the series, it combines humor with epic adventure.  This was the last of the series to be published in the U.S., but 3 additional entries were published in a single volume in the U.K. (these can be ordered through amazon.uk).  This book was pretty hard to put down!  Many plot elements that had been developing throughout the series are tied together by the ending, and there are some spectacular sequences dealing with large-scale conflicts in the land of Raemllyn.

This is a very fast-moving adventure story focusing on Davin Anane and Goran One-Eye, and thus (in contrast to book 4 of the series, &quot;Death's Acolyte&quot;) tends toward the comical and lighthearted side of the genre.  This book is a real page-turner!

This is book 4 of the superior series &quot;The Swords of Raemllyn.&quot;  When I first read this book back in '86, I was disappointed that it followed only one of the main characters, Lijena.  But this emphasis will be offset by book 5 of the series &quot;Beasts of the Mist&quot; and Lijena's character certainly needed some development, since she had been revenge-obsessed.  The story seems to be standard fare until about a third of the way through, when a new character appears in her life and her character starts to become transformed.  This book can almost be read alone, apart from the rest of the series, but certainly contributes to the ongoing story very well; a good, solid fantasy novel that leans toward the serious and dark side.  The new character is no mere comic relief, but does helps greatly to lighten the book and thus provide some balance for Lijena's darkness; this character is one that I'd like to read more about.  His straightforward, almost stoic approach to life, and his aloof pacifism bring needed counterpoint to Lijena's quest and plight.  I hope he or a similar character reappears in other Vardeman writings.  The ending contains a suitable amount of spactacle, well-presented, to wrap things up nicely in this volume, while sustaining the ongoing story elements. 6.2hrs.	2002-11-15

One of the problems with this series is that it has two protagonists, separated except for the male's love and devotion to the female, and that although I find the male protagonists' adventures rather interesting, I am expected to put up with the female's tiresome circumstances as well.  By the end of this volume, which I finished reading back in '99, I was no longer interested in reading about \\"Queen Inos.\\"  Her sorry plight was an old cliche to begin with: can the high-born, well-bred princess overcome the \\"stuffiness\\" of her training to become a successful queen without losing her sense of humanity and connection with the masses?  Puleeez!!!  The answer is only of concern if we truly felt she was one of \\"the masses\\" (that includes US, the readers) to begin with.  For this sort of thing, done in a real and thus more interesting setting, pull some volumes of Charles Dickens off the shelf.  Books like these are what gives fantasy a bad name in the minds of many... There is no indication so far that ANY of this will resolve in a way that was worth devoting nearly 2,000 pages to!  Although I suppose that I will eventually read the third book in the series, given enough time... no one should hold their breath waiting for my review of it.  For those who actually enjoyed this series, I recommend the numerous series of David Eddings that dealt with the same sort of scenarios, but did it with a lot more gusto, humor, variety, and INTERESTING CHARACTERS!  Still, it should surprise no one that the genre is dominated by formulaic adventures in which authors seem to be paid by the word.  I would steer readers away from THIS Duncan series and back toward some of the better ones.  To me it looks like Duncan is merely churning out more of the same.  My tastes have turned toward the more humorous vein of fantasy.  For ponderous outings like this, it is far better to read ACTUAL historical fiction where there is at least some educational benefit for the time that is spent.  These sorts of formulaic meanderings are no longer of interest to me, or (I suspect) many fantasy readers who have already read the same sort of thing but in a different package (and probably, using far fewer words to relate the same content!!!)	2002-11-11

I am generally unimpressed.  Characterization is undistinguished.  There is sometimes some spectacle, and this is the main thing that redeems the series, which looks like it could be extended forever.  The books were interesting enough to read, some more interesting than others, but not interesting enough for me to seek out more.  This is the sort of fantasy that takes itself too seriously.  It lacks the interest of Michael Moorcock's dark \\"Elric\\" series, which sorted its (much more creative) episodes into smaller units (usually three per short book).  Perhaps this Swords series was inspired by the Moorcock books...  I recommend people check those out instead; while limited in the scope of their themes, I at least read another one of them occasionally (7 so far!) and continue to find them somewhat interesting.  But the Swords books...I see nothing at all to distinguish the Swords books from jillions of other fantasy books that have been cranked out over the last 3.5 decades.  I now favor the more lighthearted fantasies of L. Sprague de Camp, Fritz Leiber, and Robert E. Vardeman.  For things with the sort of epic historical scope that Saberhagen's Swords aspire toward, why read FANTASY when there is so much NONFICTION about epic historical events that are far more interesting and relevant to people!!!	2002-11-11

Starting with the superior \\"To Demons Bound\\" this is the second of the Swords of Raemllyn series.  I was tempted to rate this 3 stars because of its episodic nature, but it wouldn't really be fair to rate it, in isolation, lower than the surrounding two books.  The amusing adventures continue from the first book; and the nature of the heroes' quest(s) becomes clearer.  There is a noteworthy surprise midway through as a character named Glylina appears!  Some shortcomings of this volume are that some of the episodes feel superfluous to advancing the plot, one or two gags have gotten a bit repetitive, and the fact that in the U.S. this book was published as a separate volume rather than combined with surrounding ones in the series (a fault corrected in the U.K.).  But I have finished re-reading this book AND book 3  at the time of writing this review, and feel that the first 3 books of the series should be judged as a unit (as they were published in the U.K., possibly found through amazon.uk) and they earn the 4-star, superior, rating. Despite some flaws, they are page-turners!  (In my youth when first reading this book 17 years ago, I had no such misgivings as listed above, and thus my former self gives a full 4 stars.)   6.3hrs.	2002-11-11

I began reading the series back in '99, after I had been thoroughly entertained by Duncan's &quot;The Reaver Road&quot; when it had been favorably mentioned by someone I respect.  The book has verious elements of interest, but takes its time (and ours) in elaborating on its very drawn out plot strands.  Of most interest to me was the male protagonist's brief captivity, which was quite intense.  The female parallel protagonist I did not find to be quite so interesting.  This series is notably lacking in the humor that was present throughout &quot;The Reaver Road,&quot; and despite the sheer number of pages devoted to their characterization, I found that the protagonists generally lacked any noteworthy trait for a fantasy series, save for Rap's nascent prestidigitation skills.  This whole scenario was done far better (several times) by David Eddings, without the ponderousness.	2002-11-11

Now we have some of the various problems being resolved in a satisfying wrap-up for part one of this entertaining swords and sorcery series.  I have to admit that the first third of this book had some problems; besides my minor complaints with the second book applying here, I could not at all accept the Narain scenario as credible, once its nature was revealed.  However, once that segment of the book passes, a momentum is again built up well, and although the gullibility of some characters can be vexing, this is an entertaining fantasy series.  By the end of this book I was satisfied that it was delivering on its promises from the first book!  My reviews of this series continue with book 4 \\"Death's Acolyte\\".  ...	2002-11-11

Sprague de Camp; while providing a fantasy adventure, it also seeks to entertain with ample amounts of humor.  I laughed aloud in several parts.  The two main characters are great fun, a third adds extra drama and long-term character conflict elements, and the book nicely sets up a large scale storyline for the books that follow.  Far better than most fantasy quests (ones that are routine and humorless) since the scenario goes well beyond the cliche of simply finding a ring or sword.  Also, rather than bombard the reader with innumerable names and places, the book takes care to present each new character in a memorable and distinct way.  The direction of the overall quest only begins to take shape toward the end, and appears complex enough to sustain an entire series.  Definitely recommended for genre fans, and especially for those who haven't yet enjoyed the lighter side of fantasy (a style that entertains broadly WITHOUT stooping to ridiculous parody).  A careful balance of the humorous, epic, lighthearted, horrific and even dramatic sustains this book well and leaves readers immediately yearning for the second book, \\"A Yoke of Magic\\".	2002-11-08

Its style of fantasy follows in the tradition of L. Sprague de Camp and Fritz Leiber, in what can be termed \\"Swords, Sorcery, and Sex.\\"  (NOTE: Those who hate ALL fantasy books will probably not make an exception for this one.)  The tale primarily concerns the adventures of the thief Davin Anane (who wrestles with feelings of honor and guilt), his brawling companion Goran One-Eye (a non-human trapped in a human's body), and Lijena (a woman who is ensnared in unfortunate chains of events).  This book is notable in its handling (juggling?) of diverse moods and plot threads, effectively inviting readers gradually from at first just following two adventurers, but then toward a grand web of large-scale historical events in the land of Raemllyn.  While such a scenario may be seen as standard for the genre, this book is always interesting and avoids many of the shortcomings of other fantasy genre books.  For one thing, the book is not merely a humorless exercise in \\"achieving the goals of the quest,\\" as so many other books are.  (Such other books presume that their characters are inherently interesting merely because we're reading about them as protagonists.)  Rather, there were numerous times when I laughed aloud at jokes and antics that occurred.  Secondly, readers won't immediately be swamped with a million names of flat characters, lands and events.  Rather, step are deliberately taken to present and then develop all pertinent characters in a way that makes them memorable.  Third, the authors take steps to present scenes of sex and violence in a context that actually contributes to the characters and story, rather than only being presented to capture readers' prurient interests.  Many fantasy stories are made even more unreal by the sexless nature of their characters and settings, with portrayals that are implicitly and habitually puritan (or childlike?).  By contrast, here is a scenario that is much more in-line with the social realities of known historical settings (although obviously in a purely fictional environment).  For example, a sequence of rape and torture is actually useful because of the internal and interpersonal conflicts that the main characters then must wrestle with long afterward.  Finally, it is not made immediately clear what the \\"quest\\" of the characters will be.  It is only by the end of this first book that we start to get some intriguing indications of where \\"the fates\\" will take them.  Thus, the \\"quest\\" is not a simpleminded one in which they must merely retrieve a ring or sword.  Many fantasy stories still sell merely on the basis of achieving the simple adventure quest.  This series offers a more complicated scenario and a more sophisticated set-up than most.  Definitely recommended for genre fans, and for those who wish to check out the bawdier but also more humorous and entertaining subgenre of fantasy to which this belongs.  The technical aspects of the writing style are good: not the sort of thing that one can read absent-mindedly without any effort, yet at the same time always keeping in touch with the goal of providing ENTERTAINMENT.  A balancing act, one might say, that for me is pulled off quite well!  (NOTE: I also enjoyed the book as a much younger reader when it first came out.  This review is based on a re-reading in Nov. 2002).  6.5hrs.	2002-11-05

Far superior to what I've read of the seemingly endless series work that Duncan has done, here he gives a laudable contribution to the lighthearted subgenre of fantasy (in the style of Fritz Leiber, L. Sprague de Camp, and Robert E. Vardeman).  Thus, there are many amusing tongue-in-cheek adventures.  Thoroughly entertaining protagonists and settings make for a worthy diversion over two or three evenings.  A curious feature of the story, that I couldn't help but notice, however, is that the two protagonists apparently are naked throughout fully half of the book!!! 8.5hrs	2002-11-05

Despite having read and been impressed by other Wallerstein books, I was almost discouraged by some of the reviews that appeared here, talking about how \\"dry\\" this book is and how it is overfull of quotations and such.  Ridiculous.  I checked it out of a nearby research library and was quickly impressed enough to order a copy for myself at $60!  The quotations are fascinating and readers should be impressed by the massive amount of material that Wallerstein has reviewed.  Readers seeking an introductory work should look elsewhere.  This is the first volume in a series of highly groundbreaking contributions to macrosociology.  I personally find it much more illuminating that Wallerstein uses extensive footnoting (where most of the quotations appear) and would much rather read full quotations in these notes than simply see references to hundreds of works that I probably won't have the time and resources to locate anyway.  That way, readers can appreciate what they're supposed to from the cited sources rather than just take for granted that they fit in, or have to research them on their own.  The book makes valuable points with good regularity and fits them together into what would then be recognized in the field as World Systems Theory.  Once I have finished it entirely, I may want to shift my rating.  For now, the theoretical significance of this book (whose qualities are verified by my readings so far) definitely makes it essential reading for grad students or professionals in macrosociology.  Introductory readers should probably start with introductory chapters (in theory and global inequalities) from a basic Sociology textbook and then read Wallerstein's more concise statement \\"Historical Capitalism\\" before proceeding on to this detailed series of books.	2002-09-18

Some background is given on how these inequalities are rooted in half a millenium of colonialism and (now) neocolonialism. For readers new to Wallerstein's thinking, this book will require quite a bit of study but many pages are just overflowing with profound insights. The result will be an understanding that will provide intelligent and studious readers with a framework that can be used to interpret modern history and current international events, as well as inequalities and issues within most countries around the world.<br />Highly recommended reading for advanced undergraduates, grad students, and professionals. Only 110 pages, but can easily fill an entire weekend for the studious reader.<BR>An outstanding work that should be read before Wallerstein's more detailed analyses, such as \\"The Modern World-System\\" series.	2002-05-03

Argument three is a combination of junk science and legitimate physical effects that television viewing can have on the body.  Since Mander is obviously no scientist, the section verges on paranoid hysteria and lacks any grounded perspective of the cumulative effects (or lack thereof) on most people.  Mander shows his ignorance of theory construction generally, and medicine and evolution specifically.  The result is similar to \\"grand social theorists\\" of several centuries ago - far too many ideas and far too attempts to confirm their truth (if something seems possible, it is assumed to be, simply because it fits in, rather than because it has been tested and confirmed...)<br />The last argument - that television message are inherently limited in their sophistication, should merely be an argument for BALANCING television with other artivities.  There are various passages (perhaps even a few entire chapters) that I consider acceptable here, but far too much junk cluttering up the \\"arguments.\\"  This is a case where I am willing to agree with many of the conclusions of the author, but find his methods of \\"reasoning\\" to be completely inappropriate and ineffective at guiding a truly informed audience to that same conclusion.  Selective content in the book is worthwhile, and at the time it may have been groundbreaking (although it reads like it was written during the 60s Vietnam era rather than the 70s when it was published) and for this reason I give the book a 2 star rating.  Readers wishing a fair assessment of the effects of television technology should definitely look elsewhere, however.ndbreaking (although it reads like it was written during the 60s Vietnam era rather than the 70s when it was published) and for this reason I give the book a 2 star rating.
