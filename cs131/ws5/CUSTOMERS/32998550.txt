This book was disappointing to me.  Here's why:<br />The ending stunk.  *SPOILER AHEAD*  Jack spends his whole life hating Wallingford for many reasons.  All of a sudden, when Wallingford shows up on the island, Jack forgives everything because he thinks that's what Lorelei would want.  Um, I highly doubt that that much justified anger and hostility would all but dissolve just because Lorelei wished it so.<br />Lorelei tells both Justin and Jack that she loves them both.  Jack is understandably upset by this, but that's the end of it.  Yes, I believe you may be able to love two men at once, but I don't find that a particularily compelling storyline in romance novels.<br />Jack and his crew spend the entire book telling Lorelei how horrible Wallingford and his son are.  Yet, no mention is made of anything horrible that Justin has done.  Besides being a pasty-faced bore, he really doesn't do anything that deserves Jack or his crew's rage.  On the other hand, Wallingford does all of these cruel things and Lorelei seems totally unaffected by it.  She never confronts him with the horrible stories she has heard.<br />Wallingford is supposedly this cruel man.  He burns people alive and kills for sport.  Now, because he is dying, he becomes this crying mess of a man who everyone forgives and he dies a peaceful death.  Come on!  And Wallingford's other sons never address the fact that Black Jack is their brother.  That is never  discussed.  Lorelei's reaction to finding out that her ex-fiancee and her current lover are half-brothers is never discussed.  It should have been an integral part of the book.<br />The sex scenes were totally tame.  The book is entitled, \\"Master of Seduction.\\"  In my humble opinion, Lorelei did most of the seducing.  And once Jack got her into bed, there was nothing all that great about it.  This was a man who had supposedly bedded and pleased hundreds and hundreds of women in his lifetime.  But his lack of inventiveness and rather boring style of sex belied that fact.  For a sex expert, I found him rather lacking. ;)<br />I wish I could give this 5 stars.  This will be the first K.M. book I haven't given 5 stars.  But I just found so much lacking in this one.  I am going to read, \\"A Pirate of Her Own\\" next, so hopefully that's better.ness and rather boring style of sex belied that fact.

I was so bored by Anthony, the murder plot, and most of all, Alicia.  I couldn't have cared less who killed Ruskin and Alicia was about as interesting as a wet noodle.  Anthony sounded sexy, but how he could be interested in someone as boring as Alicia I don't know.  Maybe she perked up a bit after page 80, but I wasn't going to stick around to find out.<br />Stephanie Laurens may have written too many books to come up with an original plot.  This one is so overdone by S.L. that I simply couldn't force myself to read it anymore.<br />Sorry to all the SL fans out there - this one is a dud.	2004-06-09

She is truly the best romance author out there right now-and no, this is not Kinley, nor am I related to her or a friend of hers :).<br />Perfect, perfect, perfect is how I describe every K.M. book I have ever read.  &quot;Master of Desire&quot; is my favorite, but they are all fantastic.  <br />My only criticism of this book is that I found the whole Braden/women thing a bit far-fetched.  The women *always* chase him?  He *never* instigates the relationships - even when these women are throwing themselves at him?!  Come on!  But besides that ridiculousness, this was a perfect read.<br />I highly recommend this (as if you couldn't tell).	2004-06-06

Her books are filled with great characters, minor subplots (major ones are a pet peeve of mine), and hot sex scenes.  I usually read her books in one sitting because they are too good to put down.  This one was no exception.<br />Let's start by saying, Sin is HOT.  For you ladies out there who love a tortured hero, Sin is your man.  I mean, you couldn't get more tortured (emotionally and physically) than Sin.  Callie is his perfect counterpart.  She is not haughty, condescending, or frigid.  She is a warm, loving, but human woman who loves Sin for all the right reasons.  They are totally perfect for one another.<br />If I had to criticize one thing *SPOILER AHEAD*, I would take exception to Sin being a virgin.  I don't doubt the man so abused by life would be a virgin at age 30.  I do think the intial sex scenes between him and Callie would have been a bit more...exciting.  I mean, this guy has gone 30 years without having sex.  Don't you think that first time would be a bit explosive?!  The love scenes get hotter as the book progresses, but I found the first few a little tame for Kinley's usual style.<br />Other than that tiny criticism, this was a perfect read!  I highly recommend it to everyone!	2004-06-06

But I just cannot click with her particular style.  Yes, this book was a decent read.  The characters were definitely well-developed and I liked the change of pace of having a distant and seemingly cold heroine.  But that is where my enjoyment of this book ended. <br />This was definitely my last Balogh novel.  I have tried to read several of her books-while I always enjoy the plot and character development, the romance part just fizzles.  There is such a lack of passion and sensuality in her books.  These are G-rated books...I guess you could say I prefer something with a little more spice. :)  The sex scenes are dull and don't contain any sort of variance or heart-pounding excitement.<br />This book is for those romance fans who prefer mild, G-rated, almost pure love stories.  If you're looking for a really great read, try Kinley Macgregor or Nicole Jordan.	2004-06-06

The hot pirate on the cover doesn't hurt anything either. ;)  This story is great because there is no intrigue, no mystery, and no real subplot.  There is a tiny subplot about Gideon's mother, but it's hardly mentioned and Jeffries doesn't waste pages and pages going on about it.  The story is 99.9% about the romance.<br />The sex scenes sizzled, although I thought they might be a bit more creative.  I mean, after all, the man is a pirate.  Didn't he have some fun tricks up his sleeve?! ;)  This was definitely sensual and I truly believed the characters loved and cared for each other.  <br />Sara was a *bit* too perfect for me.  She was forever chastising everyone about their \\"sins.\\"  She apparently had none.  She never made mistakes and had no personality flaws to speak of.  I think giving her a little bit of humanity would have helped the story.<br />Definitely a fun and romantic read.  I highly recommend it!	2004-06-04

I have loved every Nicole Jordan book I have read.  The sex scenes were so inventive and sizzling - that is what set N.J. apart from the norm.  This book really disappointed in that regard.  Until about page 300, the sex scenes were really tame and not at all in N.J.'s usual style.  Once I hit about page 300, the sensuality started to pick up a bit.<br />The whole subplot in this was much more involved than I liked.  I like the story to be 99.9% about the characters and their romance and the rest about a tangent storyline.  This subplot really took up too much of the story and I found myself skipping whole pages at a time.<br />Overall, it was a good read and I would recommend it for someone who prefers intensive subplots and tame sex scenes.  Not bad, but not great either.	2004-06-02
US	32998550	R2VNGIZROJ82FR	0553299573	648885839	Blaze	Books	4	15	16	N	N	Almost perfect, but not quite.	This was a fabulous story, but it did have its faults.  First of all, this was my first Susan Johnson book and I had heard she was similar to Robin Schone in regards to hot sex scenes.  Well, I was VERY disappointed in that regard.  The sex scenes were typical of a romance novel and there was nothing hot or particularly sexy about them.  There is a part in the story where Blaze and Hazard have been apart and a terrible misunderstanding has occurred between them.  They finally end up in bed together and the sex just falls flat.  It could have been an incredibly moving, sensual experience, but it really fizzled instead.<br />Another problem I had was the failure of the main characters to resolve misunderstandings.  They have a HUGE one where Hazard actually thinks Blaze betrayed him and tried to have him killed.  Instead of talking it through, they ignore it.  Hazard finally realizes (I'm assuming) that Blaze was innocent, but there is no verbal communication about it.  I mean, if I thought somone was trying to kill me, I would want some clarification from them before I had sex with them and built a life with them! :)<br />Despite this shortcomings, this was a great book.  It was great writing and an interesting story.  I am looking forward to reading the next in this series, \\"The Silver Flame.\\"	2004-06-02

I have read hundreds and hundreds of romance novels.  Kinley Macgregor is one of my newest favorites.  Here is what I LOVE about Kinley's writing:<br />The [love] scenes are sensual, passionate, explicit-but NOT flowery, drawn out, or without emotion.  <br />Macgregor makes words work for her.  Instead of going on and on about mundane things, she uses her words to paint pictures, create emotions, and describe characters that move me.  I don't skip over whole sections of her books because she doesn't bore me to tears with details that I don't care about.<br />There is no subplot.  I mean, yes, there are other things going on than just the romance.  But the romance is the biggest and most important part of the book.  Instead of trying to be a murder/mystery novelist, Macgregor sticks with romance.  Thank goodness an author who can build a whole story on romance and not feel the need to elaborate on boring subplots!!!<br />This book was beautiful and I found I had butterflies in my stomach throughout most of it.  Draven is one of the the most sexy, dark, passionate characters I have ever read about.  I love that he wasn't used to being touched...that made the sensuality of the whole story that much more powerful.<br />Emily is a truly lovable character...I cared about her and thought her personality was so complex and true to reality.  I wanted her and Draven to fall in love and to help heal each other's pains.  I rooted for them throughout the entire book.  I absolutely loved these characters and the whole story surrounding them!<br />I would give this book 100 stars if I could!  It's a must read!	2004-05-23

I have read a few other Liz Carlyle books and thought they were okay, but this one was horrible.<br />I hate romance novels where the author is trying too hard to write for a different genre.  This is a ROMANCE novel, not a murder mystery.  I could barely keep my attention on the story it was so tedious and uninteresting.  I found myself skipping whole pages because I couldn't bear to read them.<br />The sex scenes were few and far between. The ones that did exist were passionate enough, but way too far into the story.  I don't think Catherine and Max should have jumped in the sack by page 5, but I also don't think it should have taken 300 pages.<br />This book really turned me off to Liz Carlyle.  I guess my tastes run a little differently than other reviewers here.  If you want a fiction murder mystery with a LITTLE sex and romance thrown in, this is your book.  If you like a ROMANCE novel with a little story thrown in, this is definitely not for you.	2004-05-13

Instead of hitting him back (my preferred reaction) or taking him to task, she forgives him and shoulders most of the blame.  The whole interaction disgusted me.  I don't mind that the man had a temper.  In fact, I think an angry man can be a sexy man.  But he should have hit the wall or thrown a priceless vase.  He shouldn't have hit a defenseless, innocent woman.<br />Lucien is NOT a hero, a man, or anyone I could admire or root for.  He is a spineless coward who uses his fists against people who are no match for him physically.  And then to say he did it because he loves her so much - UGH!  He's a wife beater and I wish instead of forgiving him, Beth would have kneed him in the balls.<br />I'm not sure I can ever read another Jo Beverly.  This was my first and it really turned me off.	2004-05-13

I had such high hopes for Luc.  He was so sharp-tongued and devilishly arrogant in \\"On a Wild Night.\\"  I expected him to lash that tongue out at everyone, but he proved to be quite a bore.<br />The whole premise of the book is ridiculous.  He has known Amelia for 20 years, but all-of-a-sudden decides he lusts after her and has secretly loved her all along?!  That's a little hard to swallow.  <br />I love conflict between the hero and heroine in romance novels.  I think the fighting and sexual tension is great.  There was barely any conflict at all.  The only time Amelia got mad at Luc was when she found out he was rich (oh, what a reason to get mad-NOT).  For two people who were supposedly passionate and outspoken, these two never had any conflicts.  Boring.<br />The whole subplot of Fiona was pointless.  Just more words and no meaning.  Speaking of words, could S.L. get any wordier?  My God, woman, just say what you want to say and spare us the 10 page long descriptions of a kiss!  <br />I must say, the sex sizzled a little more in this one than in most S.L. novels.  But they just kept doing it!  And it was such flowery prose that I skipped most of it.  In fact, I probably skipped 1/4 of the book because it was just too darn boring.<br />I may have to give up on S.L.  I really liked \\"Devil's Bride,\\" but have been continually disappointed since.  I really cannot recommend this one either.	2004-05-11

Amanda is likable, but I don't see much that would have inspired an obsession like the one Martin developed for her.  She was pretty conniving, but I don't fault her for that.  If I met a handsome rake at a gaming hell I might try and snag him too.  But she snags him in such a BORING way.  There's no pizzazz to the way she goads him into escorting her to all of these supposedly scandalous outings.  There was so much potential for sexual sizzle at the various outings, but instead they were really boring.<br />Stephanie Laurens is always wordy, but this book was out of control.  The sex scenes were so boring and incredibly painful to get through.  There's so much fluff that you can barely tell they are having sex!  It's such flowery prose and totally pointless blather.<br />After reading an author like Robin Schone, this was lame.  I still like S.L., but she's definitely not my favorite.	2004-05-09

I found both of the main characters very physically unappealing.  The hero is described as a thin man with hips like a dancer.  Ew.  The heroine is wiry and built like a young boy.  Ew.  I'm glad I read this one before \\"Beyond Innocence\\" because Merry is described as being even uglier in that book.<br />Now, don't get me wrong - I don't expect the characters to be physically perfect, but I was totally unattracted to the description of Nick's body.  I admit it - I love a good, tall, thick, dark Alpha Male.  I don't like shorter, thinner, artsy kind of guys.  And I would like the woman to look at least a little like a woman.  She is so often described as looking like a young boy that I begin to wonder if Nick likes boys or girls.  Which leads me to my next beef with this book...<br />Sebastian, Evangeline, and Nick had threesomes.  Nick strokes Sebastian's cheek at one point and I began to wonder if maybe he wasn't a gay or at least bisexual man...now, there's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't really fit with this particular genre.<br />The sex was good, but seemed a little rushed in the beginning.  Merry was really a flirt and totally sexually aggressive in \\"Beyond Innocence,\\" so I guess it's not surprising that she is rather jaded and pretty \\"easy\\" in this book.  She doesn't wait long to have sex with Nick.  I guess I prefer a little begging on the part of the man. :)<br />I'm glad I also bought \\"Beyond Innocence\\" when I bought this book. If I hadn't, I probably wouldn't have bought another Emma Holly book.	2004-05-09
US	32998550	R3AXMEFFMHRLQZ	0380812029	66659014	All About Passion	Books	4	8	9	N	N	This book lacked character.	The character of Chillingworth always intrigued me.  He seemed the ultimate rogue - the eternal bachelor.  And I hoped his downfall would be exciting and passionate.  Well, it was and it wasn't.<br />First of all, the whole thing about Francesca learning about sex from watching her parents (on multiple occasions) was more than a little disturbing.  She didn't just walk in on them.  She spied on them and learned her sex moves from them.  Can you say, creepy?!  Come on, that is downright bizarre.  But, if you could get past that, the story was decent.<br />This book was all about Chillingworth.  The author gave very little insight into Francesca's character.  We know nothing about her parents, her life growing up in Italy, and what she thinks and feels.  She is a very 2 dimesional character.  She is half-Italian, passionate, and hot-blooded.  But rarely does her passionate nature shone through.  She is content to rein herself in to capture Chillingworth's heart - noble?  Maybe.  A little boring?  Definitely.<br />This was a nice read (aside from the whole sex/parents thing).  Definitely not my favorite, but decent.	2004-05-04

Wow...I was blown away!  I often find myself reading romance novels and wishing the romance was a little...hotter.  Well, this book did not disappoint!  <br />But I would not classify this as erotica.  I would classify it as a sexy, passionate romance novel.  There was an intriguing plot, but it was not so complex that it took away from the romance.  I find too many romance authors try to make their books into romance/mystery novels.  I don't read romance novels for the mystery, ok?!  I want romance, love, passion, sex, etc.  And Ms. Schone delivered.<br />I look forward to reading more of her books.	2004-05-04

I don't care if she cut her hair, put on pants, and lowered her voice an octave.  Any reasonable human being is never going to believe that a beautiful young woman is a man.<br />This leads me to my next gripe.  Antonia was WAY too young for this situation.  She is seduced and sexually experienced before her 17th birthday!  Call me naive and a bit narrow minded, but that's kind of disturbing.  Especially when the seducer is a man over 30.  Yuck.<br />Other than those two points, this was a good book.  The steaminess was good and the dialogue was good.  Not my favorite, but definitely not the worst out there.	2004-04-26

I loved \\"Devil's Bride\\" and \\"A Rake's Vow\\" and bought the entire Bar Cynster series after reading the first two.  I wish I would have looked at \\"Scandal's Bride\\" a little more closely before spending the money.<br />I thought Scandal was sexy in \\"Devil's Bride\\" and \\"A Rake's Vow.\\"  I mean, he wasn't mentioned all that often, but as Devil's half-brother, he was sure to be sexy and strong, right?  Well, his character in \\"Scandal's Bride\\" is okay, but the heroine and plot make this book disappointing.<br />I never connected with the heroine.  And I am NOT a huge fan of supernatural storylines.  I think Richard would have thought her a mentally ill young woman and ran the other way.  I know that Scotland is full of mysticism and lore, but I agree with the other poster who said a woman known for \\"witchcraft\\" in that day and age would have been condemned, killed, or at least branded an outcast.<br />I just didn't care enough about these characters and this story to read past the first few chapters.  <br />I can't recommend this one.

The characters were great, the story was great, and I loved all of the tension and sparring.  I loved that there was no nefarious subplot about murder or intrigue.  It was a simple, straight-forward love story with a matchmaking twist.<br />As with all J.Q. books, the love scenes were dull and NOT exciting at all.  This is the reason I only gave it 4 stars.  But that really didn't take away from the story too much.  Overall, definitely one of my favorite J.Q. books.	2004-04-08

She is certainly headstrong and tough in the beginning.  But after she marries the hero, she becomes this wet noodle.  She apologizes for things that HE did wrong and simpers in his presence.  Not my idea of a tough American gal.<br />The heroine basically begs for sex from this guy knowing he doesn't love her.  She is just the epitome of a woman with no self-respect.<br />The hero is so emotionally detached that it is hard to even like him a little.  He finally comes around in the end, but by that time you dislike him so much you don't care anymore.<br />The subplot about the Madame from France was silly, but I guess the story needed some spice.  <br />Definitely not my favorite, but I guess it was okay.	2004-04-07

I liked the plot and found the characters endearing, if a bit two dimensional.  However, there was no sizzle!  The characters are intimate twice in the book and both times are DULL.  They have pined for each other for 7 years, have 7 years of passion-filled longing for one another, and yet the first time they make love it's over so fast and is so boring that you're not even sure anything happened.<br />The descriptions of the amorous scenes leave alot to be desired.  The characters are so full of passion for one another that you just want them to go nuts for each other.  Unfortunately, J.Q. fell terribly short on that aspect.<br />It was entertaining and fluffy.  If you like the romance novels with little to no sex, this is your book.  (...)	2004-04-07

The author really wanted us to know that this heroine was tall and big.  She kept referring to her as this gargantuan beast.  She towers over most men and is stronger than most men.  I mean, by the time I'm done reading this thing, I'm imagining someone from the WWF.<br />And the hero in this book keeps referring to her as an Amazon.  I'm sorry, but even if you're tall, no one wants to be called an Amazon!  I know the guy was taller and bigger, but I just felt like it was two men falling in love (not that there's anything wrong with that).  It just wasn't my idea of an ideal romance novel.<br />I don't think I'll be picking up anything else by this author.  Obviously others disagree and really liked this book.  I guess to each his own.	2004-04-07

After reading \\"Dancing at Midnight,\\" I wasn't so sure I'd be a huge Julia Quinn fan.  But reading \\"Minx\\" has made me a believer.<br />We learn about Dunforn in \\"Dancing at Midnight,\\" and definitely want to see him find the love and happiness that Alex, Emma, Belle, and John have found.  He's such a likable guy and the whole storyline is unique and fun.<br />If I could change one thing about this book, I would change the heroine's name.  I know it was supposed to original, but having her have a blatantly male name was a bit disconcerting.  And to think of Dunford crying out \\"Henry\\" in ecstasy was a bit too much for me. :)  Other than that, the book was wonderful.<br />Henry was a lovable, free-spirited original.  Her lack of care of society's rules made her one of my favorite heroines.  I loved her blunt speech and ability to win everyone over.  She seemed a bit immature in the beginning when she was trying to make Dunford leave Stannage Park, but I guess that was intentional.  She grew as a character throughout the story.<br />Just like in the first J.Q. novel I read, the sex scenes in \\"Minx\\" left a lot to be desired.  There was a lot of heartfelt passion, but not alot of physical action to back it up.  The sex scenes are pretty dull and there's not alot of description in those.  If you're looking for some really scintillating stuff, read any Nicole Jordan novels.  If you like the softer stuff, then J.Q. is definitely for you.	2004-03-29

I won't write too long of a review, since it seems this book is no longer in publication.<br />I do need to say that I hated both of these characters.  Blaise was annoying, immature, and totally ridiculous.  She fell in love with Julian almost immediately, even though she supposedly detested &quot;cold fish&quot; English noblemen.  She reminded me of a dog that is continuously neglected and mistreated but still loves his master.<br />Julian is incredibly annoying and totally unsympathetic as a &quot;wounded hero.&quot;  He is a crybaby who wants a doormat for a wife.  Well, then I guess he shouldn't have seduced Blaise in a hayloft if he wasn't willing to be a man and marry her afterwards.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he didn't know she was a noblewoman.  So, instead, he decides he will seduce her and then maker her his mistress.  Yeah, those are nice intentions.  What a gentleman.  NOT.<br />The whole plot of this novel is absurd.  The way Julian treats Blaise is condescending and just mean-spirited.  It's not Blaise's fault that Julian neglected his wife and drove her into another man's arms.  It's not Blaise's fault that Caroline (the late wife) died in a storm.  Nothing he blames her for is her fault.  Mostly it is all his fault.  Ugh...he has to be the most unendearing &quot;hero&quot; I've ever encountered.<br />If you come across this one at a booksale, I wouldn't recommend putting out the $0.25 for it.	2004-03-27

I don't know what it was exactly, but the Kleypas magic was missing.  I liked the character of Savage - especially in the end when he really did turn into a jealous savage! ;)  But the Julia character irritated me.  She was far too docile in her dealings with Logan.  I know she feared losing her job and that Logan was a man to be reckoned with.  But I highly doubt a spirited young woman who gave up her fortune and became an actress would allow a man like Logan Scott to yell at her and criticize her unmercifully.  <br />I forgave Logan for his nastiness because I know in the sequel he is tamed by Charlotte.  But I don't think Julia should have tolerated that from him.  She was far too docile a character.  I like them feisty and unafraid to take on the tough characters head on.<br />The storyline was interesting and the book was still a good read.  It's worth it just to watch Lord Savage lose his cool and become a man possessed at the end.  Sexy guy!	2004-03-26

She manages to create memorable characters, interesting storylines, and sensual love scenes.  This book was no exception.<br />I liked this novel because there were a few elements not usually included in this genre.  First of all, Holly was married before and actually loved her husband.  Usually, widowed women in these stories were abused, mistreated, neglected, etc.  And while I don't mind those scenarios, this one was a nice change of pace.<br />Secondly, Holly has a 4 year old daughter.  It seems to be very seldom that the heroine already has a child when she meets the hero.  It added a very sweet, very touching element when Zachary forms a relationship with Rose (Holly's daughter).  I actually teared up at a few of the interactions between Zachary and Rose.  So sweet!<br />Lastly, instead of totally reforming Zachary, he reforms her.  Instead of making him a straight-laced, boring \\"gentleman,\\" he loosens her up and makes her into a more relaxed, fun character.  Holly's propriety and social awareness is a bit annoying (but most likely very historically correct).  Zachary adds spice to her life and shows her that love and passion are more important than public opinion.<br />This book is a keeper.  I highly recommend it!	2004-03-26

He is tall, dark, handsome, and seasoned.  He is a mysterious, brooding, workaholic who rarely expresses pleasure with anything.  The &quot;Monk of Bow Street.&quot;  Until Sophia shows up, of course.  <br />I love both of these characters.  Sir Ross is a total hottie who comes completely unglued in these love scenes.  He loses his reserve and control and is a total animal.  I love it!  And Sophia gets over a past troubling relationship by learning she can trust a man.  She makes such a positive influence in his life...it's hard not to love her.<br />This book is a great prequel to the book about Nick Gentry and his ladylove.

Imaginative, sensual, and HOT are words to describe the passionate interludes that Dare and Julienne share. Have a water spritzer ready because you will need to cool off!

I was a bit hesitant to read it after reading the negative reviews here.  I just finished the book and found no justification for the complaints written.  Yes, there is a rape in the beginning.  Yes, the Saxons were treated horribly by the invading Normans.  But, people!  It was the year 1066!  Frankly, the reality of the Norman Invasion was probably much more disturbing than what was described in the novel.  And at least (unlike in Catherine Coulter's &quot;Devil's Embrace), it's not hero of the story raping the heroine.  Now that book was disturbing.  But I digress...<br />This was a fabulous historical romance.  I only have two complaints:  the love scenes were EXTREMELY tame.  I mean, most of the time the author just says they did it and leaves it at that.  Secondly, the author gets a little wordy in the war scenes.  I understand she wanted to provide a little background and maybe the story would have suffered without them, but I just skimmed those pages.  <br />I cannot say enough about this book.  I want to recommend it without giving away too much of the plot.  If like medieval romance, you won't be disappointed!	2004-03-21

In this case, I felt the plot was way overdone and the characters way underdone.<br />Jacinda is described as rebellious, headstrong, spirited, and independent.  But she displays none of those traits throughout the book.  Other than her initial running away in the beginning, she is rather boring and sedate.  She has no adventures and simply exists.  Instead of the hero saving her from her mischievious misadventures, she saves his life twice.  <br />Billy...what can I say about Billy?  He is supposed to be a rough guy, but come on!  His fighting skills are so bad that he has to be saved by Jacinda twice.  He lets the leader of the rival gang get away and gets caught in a burglarly that sends him to Newgate.  He grovels to his abusive father.  When he gets jealous, he growls, but never does anything about it.  I mean, where's the passion in this guy?!  Okay, so he trades a few barbs with the old guy that Jacinda is trying to hoodwink into marriage, but does that really qualify as being a stand up guy?  I could go on and on...<br />Call me old-fashioned or call me a traditionalist.  But I want the woman to be saved physically and the man to be saved emotionally.  Billy is so emotional that even the sex scenes were boring and painful to read.  Jacinda is so sure she will end up like her mother (a known harlot) that she is half slut/half ninny.  There is just no passion between these two.  The characters seemed wooden and the storyline just ridiculously complex.<br />I can't wholeheartedly recommend this book.	2004-03-19

The character of Derek is near-perfect as an injured, lonely, self-made man.  Sara is a fabulous counterpart to his brooding as she is cheerful, innocent, and unabashedly loyal and honest.  <br />This love story was so engrossing.  I read the book in two sittings.

This was definitely a wonderful novel.<br />I highly recommend it.	2004-03-18

This book does not fall into that category.  It is well-written and very easy to follow.  I like that this novel is based mostly on historical facts.  Yes, it's definitely fiction, but the main events of the novel were true to life.  <br />This book will be a real eye-opener for anyone who doesn't realize how poorly women have been treated throughout history.  They were cursed at birth and then used and abused throughout their entire lives.  Their happiness was dependent solely on men.  That must have been a horrible way to live.  It's especially difficult for the modern American woman to fathom what that kind of life must have been like.  It must have been incredibly tough.<br />The relationship between Anne and Mary is bizarre.  I know about sibling rivalry, but this went beyond that.  This was a cut-throat, evil, primitive sort of relationship.  With a sister like Anne, who needs enemies?!  I never realized before reading this book how motivated and desperate Anne Boleyn was.  She was a woman driven by ambition only.  She is a perfect example of you reap what you sow.<br />Of course, Henry VIII is portrayed as he was - a selfish, immature, sex-crazed man who thought he was God.  He reinvented the Church so he could divorce Catherine of Aragon, beheaded and poisoned people at will, and sexually used and tossed aside countless women who loved him.  He was truly a tyrant.<br />I am glad that Mary escaped the life at court and married William Stafford for love.  She might have felt like the lesser Boleyn girl, but I think she was the braver, happier Boleyn girl.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-03-15

There is one in particular on pages 262-266 that took my breath away! <br />I also like the subplot of the romance between Livia and Shaw.

Unless you enjoy being raped and beated by someone who \\"loves\\" you, don't read this book.  Unless you get turned on when someone sexually violates you in every way possible, don't read this book.<br />This is the second book I've read by Catherine Coulter.  The first one was nothing like this piece of garbage.  And, sadly, because of this experience, I will never read her again.<br />In the first few chapters, Cassie is raped (by the HERO of the story-ha!), she is beaten with a belt (by the HERO), and is emotionally, psychologically, and sexually abused by this \\"hero.\\"  I was physically SICK after reading the rape.  Imagine my horror when, only a few pages later, he is beating her with a belt.  And acting like he was doing it for her benefit?!  How sick, disgusting, and twisted!  I cannot believe a woman author would write such trash.  Obviously she has never been raped or abused in a relationship.  She wouldn't find it so glamorous in real life, I suspect.<br />I couldn't finish this book.  Any woman who gets raped and then enjoys sex with her rapist is not a heroine I can relate to or root for.  And any man who viciously rapes and then beats a woman is no man of my dreams. <br />Read someone like Johanna Lindsey, Julie Garwood, or Teresa Medeiros.

The heroine was barely 17.  To me, that is really teetering on the line between \\"okay\\" and \\"child molestation.\\"<br />2.  The spanking sequence was weird.  Unless you're into that kind of thing, I found it odd and totally unnecessary.  It totally humiliated Storm and is not something a grown man should do to a 17 year old young woman.<br />3.  The force-fingering of Storm on the beach to check for her virginity is more than barbaric.  It's completely wrong and without merit.  Any worthwhile heroine is not going to fall in love with some man that just raped her with his finger.  Ugh.<br />Brenda Joyce can be a little too rough for my taste.

I am stunned that no other readers commented on the childhood sex abuse Stephanie suffered at the hands of Joe Morelli.  I was reading along, really enjoying the beginning of the book, when all of a sudden, Stephanie describes what Joe did to her AT AGE SIX as \\"fingering.\\"  Um, excuse me?!?!?  I assumed when they played \\"train,\\" it was sort of like playing doctor - harmless peeking, you know?  But when she described it otherwise, I was horrified.  I read it a few times just to be sure my eyes weren't deceiving me.  And then Stephanie goes on to have sex with Joe 10 years later?  And is still drawn to him years after that?  I'm not sure Evanovich is right in the head.  I just did not see that one coming...<br />Needless to say, I won't be reading any more of her books.  Maybe \\"fingering\\" is different in Jersey than it is in Detroit.  In Detroit, fingering a 6 year old is a felony and will probably cost the victim years of abuse counseling.  I just can't see the justification for that kind of violence in a supposedly \\"funny\\" book.<br />I'll stick to Sue Grafton when I want to read about a female heroine.	2004-02-16

This is the first book I've read by Patricia Cornwell.  It will also be my last.  I am absolutely baffled by the hundreds of positive reviews here on Amazon.  This book was one of the worst I have ever read.<br />First, it was so long and drawn out.  By the time you get to the end, you're on the edge of your seat waiting for that knock 'em dead moment when the killer is revealed and all of the clues are explained.  Instead, you get a boring, predictable, disappointing ending that goes nowhere.  It was like Cornwell just gave up on the story.  There were so many characters who could have been the killer - their erratic behavior explained and an interesting ending provided.  No such luck.<br />Also, Kay's lack of closure with Mark irritated me.  There is no ending to their story.  Just disappointing overall.	2004-02-16

Nancy Aniston is a melodramatic whiner who is trying to cash in on her daughter's fame - plain and simple.  She is emotionally unstable and a textbook manipulator.  I think Jennifer Aniston is better off without her mother.  Sometimes we have to rid our lives of toxic influences...even if that toxic influence is our mother.	2004-01-21

This book has NO tips about decorating within a budget or exactly &quot;how-to&quot; decorate.  The photos are of over-filled rooms with over-patterned furniture and (in my humble opinion) hideos &quot;knick-knacks.&quot;  I don't know what this style is, but I don't think most people would find this book inspirational.	2004-01-19

If you hit your dog, you are abusing your dog.  Plain and simple.  Cut and dry.  To discipline means to teach - not to hit!  Hitting is not disciplining.  Animals are ours to love - not to abuse.  Please do not purchase this book.  Buy something that encourages a mutual relationship of respect between you and your dog.	2004-01-15

I wanted something that would help me figure out what colors to use, whether or not to paint the molding, and how to make one room flow with another.  This book addressed all of those issues and more!  I am very pleased with the layout and how the book is set up as a Q&amp;A format.  I would highly recommend this book.	2004-01-14

I wanted to read a book about the struggles, sacrifices, and joys of being a stay-at-home mother. Instead, I read about a whiny, self-absorbed woman who made everyone around her miserable.  Amanda martyrs herself by staying at home with her kids because it was the same financially as paying for 2 kids to go to daycare.  She also says she feels like that is what she is obligated (through guilt)to do.  Um, those aren't really good reasons for staying at home to raise your children.  Amanda would have been better off going back to work and quitting her b*tching and whining about how bad her kids are and how useless her husband is.  At least the daycare teachers might not have thought of her children as big of a burden as Amanda did.<br />Bob's job was also took up WAY too much of this book.  The whole Megabyte case and everything involved in that storyline were boring and almost totally unnecessary to the main storyline. I started to skip the pages dealing with that subplot because it was totally irrelevant. <br />We mothers who choose to stay home to raise our families and keep our homes full-time deserve a better book than this.  We need a book about how hard the decision is, but how great the rewards are.  If you are a SAHM looking for a boost, you're not going to get it here!  I wish I could have loved the book as much as I wanted to.	2004-01-14
