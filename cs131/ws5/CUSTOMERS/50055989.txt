Jonas, a twelve year old boy, has been chosen to do an important job.  He is to become the receiver of memories.The Giver, the man in the community who has received  all the memories, is to be his teacher.  There were different jobs, such as  the caretaker, and the assistant directer of recreation. People receive  their job at the annual cemermony. Jonas has been chosen to be the  receiver, the most impotant job.   In my opinion it's quite great in  the middle of the book. The author uses good desciptions.This is one of  those science fictions or fantasy books, that I would recommend to readers  that are in sixth grade to people that are sixty. I rated the book four  stars because of the way the author is saying what she's saying. That is  that this world we live in shouldn't ever be like this.	2000-03-17

His father went to get their family, so Matt has to stay in the  wilderness and wait for his family. Attean, the Indian shows him to get  food so Matt won't get hungry.  I like the book because it takes place  in the wilderness.  I like how they made Matt try to get the honey from the  bee hive. I don't like it when the white man stole Matt's gun. Matt should  have followed him.  Comparing to Tuck Everlasting  The Sign Of The  Beaver takes place in the  wilderness, and Tuck Everlasting takes place in  the woods. In Tuck Everlasting there are no indians, it has traps from  Indians, in other place there are white man's trap too. Tuck Everlasting  has more characters.  I would give Tuck Everlasting 4 stars because I  like how they made the spring water, how the cow made the trail around the  woods, how Winnie ran away and she went in the woods, met Tucks, and how  Winnie took Mae's spot when Mae was in the jail. I would give the Sign Of  The Beaver 4 stars too because they add a lot of detail in the wilderness  such as how Matt has to take care of himself, when the bees chase after  him, and how Matt tried to teach Attean how to read.	2000-03-16

Ella Enchanted is a breath  taking, phenomenal, fiction book.This book is easier to understand if  you're older because it has challenging words. I wouldn't suggest this book  to anyone under 10 years old.Ella Enchanted explains everything. This book  is a kind of book I could not put down. I recommend it to anyone over 10  years.	2000-03-16

One day when he and a female badger meet for the first time, they check each other out, by staring at each other.  Ben goes home and says that he saw a badger.  His  father goes crazy and tells Ben to stay away from those creatures.  Ben is  very small for his age and dosen't fit in.  He becomes scared and runs into  the prairie, which is called Hawk's Hill.  Ben gets lost in the prairie and  ends up far away from home.  A storm is coming, so Ben looks for shelter  and goes down the badger hole.  The badger and Ben's relationship builds  from there.  During this time, Ben's family and friends are searching for  him.  The odd story line is what makes it a good book.  Allen. W.  Eckter, the auther deserves an award for this book.  The book is easy to  read for all ages.  There is no profanity; it is pretty easy to understand.  It is based on a true story but not everything is true.  These are the  reasons why I liked the book.  In comparing this book to Blue Jacket,  another book by the same author.  I would say I liked Incident at Hawk Hill  better.  It related to me more.  Blue Jacket is also a good book, dealing  with adventure.  However, I thought that this book was easier to read.	2000-03-16

It is fairly humorus, but more formal because it mostly talks  about how The Souls are trying to win.  I rate this book four stars.  Why?  Beacause it has very good character description, is a good book, and  is very explanatory.  I liked this novel because it is very descriptive,  good, but for some reason, sometimes I couldn't understand it!  No books  remind me of The View From Saturday, probably because it is such a good  book.	2000-03-16

He faces  Arawn evil deathlord, and makes the most crucial desicion of his life.<br />  This book wasn't a very good novel. It was a little violent and the names  are confusing. Like the name Eilonwy is a diffucult name to say. This book  is confusing unless you read the other books in the series. (The Prydain  Chronicles) They don't descibe the setting of characters in the book. They  just jump right into the story where it left off from the other book.   This book is a little like The Hobbit, by J.R.R Tolkien. I like The Hobbit  a lot better. The Hobbit was easier to follow and was very well written.   I sugjest that you read the other books first. This wasn't one of his best  written books. That is why I rated it like I did.	2000-03-16

But when  friends die in the battle Jeff changes his thoughts about war. He finds out  that war means destruction and killing.   I think Rifles for Watie  deserves a five because I think it was well written, took place in a very  important American historical event, and it has a wonderful plot. I compare  this book to War in the Ozarks. It takes place in the same region as Rifles  for Watie, and it has about the same plot.   Rifles for Watie was a  extremely exciting and excellent book.	2000-02-15

The book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, is about a animal community on a farm in the midwest.  Mrs. Frisby and her son Timothy need help.  A group of animals join together to help them.  The group of animals risk their own  lives because Mr. Frisby (who has died) was their friend.  What is unusual  about this book is the story is being told from an animal's view (Mrs.  Frisby). I give this book a five star rating because I got very involved  with the characters.  The characters were very interesting, they had  believable personalities. This book can be compared to Charlottes Web,  because both books have animal communities in both stories. Also, because  you end up caring about what happens to the characters even though they are  not real. This is a great book about farmlife in the midwest, through the  eyes of a mouse.	2000-02-15

The year is 1541 and the place is the Fortress of Juan de Ulua, near Vera Cruz, New Spain  (Mexico). Esteban records his adventures in the Land of Cibola on paper his  jailer hs supplied. The jailer has talked Esteban into making a map of  where he has hidden the treasure.<br /> The King's Fifth is exciting and  very enveloping book. I like how the book is very descriptive. What I don't  like is when they use Spanish words and they don't tell you what the words  mean. Over all on a scale of one-five, five being the best, I would give  the book a five. The plot is great. The story line makes you want to keep  on reading at the end of a chapter.The scenery is well described and you  feel as if you were there.	2000-02-15

The story takes place somewhere between the middle and the top of Canada and is about survival.  He goes on the journey, so he can finally be considerd an adult in his village. He learns how to hunt, and how to make use all of the  animals he hunts. In this book, he meets a girl, who becomes his friend. I  really liked this book because it makes you think about what it would be  like if you were in this situation.  I also liked it because it was very  enjoyable to read.  For some reason, it reminds me of Lassie.  I think  Dogsong is better though. <br />I suggest you try reading it, it's great!   In comparison to some other great books, Dogsong is as good as the Harry  Potter books.  I think Dogsong is not as good as The Giver, but much better  than The Time Machine.  So I really liked this book, and I don't know about  anybody else that doesn't like it, or has read it.  Once again, I am asking  that you at least try Dogsong out if you have not read it at all.  Also, if  you haven't tried out any other of the books I compared Dogsong with, you  should try them to.	2000-02-15
