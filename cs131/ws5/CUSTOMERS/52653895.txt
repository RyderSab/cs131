The first is Ms. Karmi's relation of an her experience as an Arab immigrant in England, and that part is excellent. I would give it five stars. (Just one example: of her relatives, she writes, \\"It was as if Englishness to them were a form of clothing, a coat or a dress which you wore when you went out into English society, but which you removed as soon as you were back with Arabs.\\") The second part, which seems to be the main reason for the book, is Ms. Karmi's relation of her version of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This part of the book, unfortunately, is very troubling.<br />When I started reading this book, it was because I was interested in hearing the Palestinian point of view. I had heard from some people that it contained a distorted view of the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but as I started reading, although the book was clearly one-sided, I did not think it was actually falsified. It just represented what a young Palestinian girl at the time would have heard about. She would not have heard about Arab massacres of Jews, obviously, while the case of Jews massacring Arabs (Deir Yassin) would have stood out quite clearly in her mind. She might have really thought that the British were pro-Jewish (though this actually made me laugh aloud). So, for the first half of this book, although I raised my eyebrows frequently, I felt that I was getting exactly what I had wanted.<br />But as Ms. Karmi started writing from the perspective of an adult, I found such allowances less convincing. Is she really entitled to start her account of the 1967 war with \\"On June 5, 1967, Israeli warplanes attacked Egypt.\\"? True, she admits that she stopped following the Middle East until that day, but a certain amount of minimum research is to be expected once she decides to put historical information into a book. As I continued reading, it became clearer that these omissions are not a result of ignorance, but of something more disturbing. In a footnote on page 370, for example, Ms. Karmi is not even willing to concede that the Western Wall (\\"the so-called Wailing Wall,\\" as she puts it) was part of the Jewish Temple -- a matter of incontrovertible historical fact.<br />This even spills over into her otherwise excellent relation of her immigrant experience. Apparently, she spent her youth being innocently tormented by those arrogant, insular Jews, but when she informed a Jewish classmate that \\"Hitler should have finished the job\\" she was un-influenced by any anti-semitism she might have heard at home. (I believe that she didn't \\"realize the import\\" of what she had said, as she claims, but in her long, rambling explanation of how innocent the incident was, she never mentions where she heard the phrase in the first place.)<br />As a whole, I have to say that I am disappointed with this book. It is very well-written and, as I said above, a valuable relation of an immigrant experience. But the author should have done more research, and should not have let her prejudices get carried away with her when it came to writing down simple matters of fact. I am not suggesting that she should write a \\"fair\\" history -- like I said, the whole point was to hear the Palestinian point of view. But I believe that the Palestinian point of view can be related without resorting to misstatements of fact.	2003-04-27
US	52653895	R3056CCKDODFQY	0393318397	296671544	Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice	Books	5	36	42	N	N	A brilliant explanation	I have studied European anti-semitism for years and recently began following the Arab media, with its plentiful dose of Muslim anti-semitism. The parallels between the two were so striking that I knew there had to be some sort of connection. A lot of Muslim anti-semitism is literally a carbon copy of medieval Christian polemics, even when it produces absurd results. (For example, a Palestinian sermon recently declared that \\"The Talmud blasphemes about Muhammed.\\" Medieval Christian anti-semites often claimed that the Talmud blasphemed against Jesus, but that was at least plausible; Muhammed, on the other hand, was born several hundred years after the Talmud was written.) I knew there had to be an explanation, but I didn't know what it was until I read this book. The historical connection that Lewis provides (backed up with lots of evidence) seems obvious to me now that I have read it.<br />As for the reviewer who claims that Lewis is a bigot... he heaps praise on all Lewis's criticism of Western anti-semitism and on his accurate depiction of the relatively better life Jews used to have in the East, but everything Lewis says about current Arab anti-semitism and Israel is rejected. I hardly know where to start in addressing his points. <br />Lewis does not downplay the Sabra and Shatilla massacres; he merely points out that it wasn't the Israelis who commited the massacres, that similar massacres were happening every couple of months during that era in Lebanese history, and that the news coverage basically ignored those facts. (Even today, Palestinians attempted to sue Sharon for not foreseeing and preventing the massacres, but haven't bothered to sue the Lebanese Christians who actually planned and committed them.)<br />Even the fact that Lewis says the Palestinians were \\"compelled\\" to leave is not exactly biased toward Israel, since there is a strong historical debate about whether they were compelled to leave or whether they fled the warfare as thousands of refugeesdo during every war. (And I have no idea where he gets the number of \\"thousands\\" of people being murdered, unless he considers every Arab soldier who died during the 1948 war to have been the victim of a murder.) <br />The idea that the Holocaust was unique, while certainly debatable, is hardly \\"scandalous.\\" And the calm depiction of the fact that Israel didn't personally try to prevent the Armenian genocide -- during a time when Israel didn't even exist, and the Jews in Palestine were struggling to survive under the Ottoman Empire -- as \\"racist\\" takes one's breath away. Can I assume that this reviewer considers the entire book moot, since the Arab world is _already_ racist merely for not trying to help the Jews during the Holocaust?  And can I assume that since he appears to feel that Jewish nationalism is racist, he feels the same way about all other forms of nationalism -- including Palestinian nationalism?<br />Incidentally, Lewis's statement about the Armenian genocide in France, while certainly insensitive, was made in the context of explaining the Turkish point of view. In his earlier book on Turkey, he called the Armenian genocide a \\"holocaust.\\"	2002-03-07

It's basically a simple story about what she did, thought, and felt when she was in Israel.  People who want real insight into the situation in Israel should look elsewhere, though -- the author herself admits that she knows little, and is sometimes incredibly naive (when she tells terrorists that she is a journalist, they are polite and serve her tea, and she concludes that they're not all that bad).  For people who know more about the region, though, this is a fascinating glimpse into a person's life and thoughts, and also provides insight into the rationale of left-wing activists in Israel.	2001-11-07
US	52653895	R13BBM0M7WP27H	0425084094	863133734	Easy Connections	Books	1	10	13	N	N	Sick	I almost never write bad reviews of books -- if I don't like them, I don't review them -- but I have to make an exception here, especially after reading all these glowing reviews. This is one of the sickest books I have ever read. The male main character is an obnoxious, evil (but gorgeous) rock star who, in Chapter Two (so I'm not really giving away anything), RAPES the female main character, who is so inconsistent that at one point she apologizes to her rapist for hurting his feelings. And this is not a case of \\"he got out of control once and now he's sorry\\" (as if that would make it okay). Later in the book, he hits her and threatens quite seriously to rape her again. He just can't understand why she's making such a big deal about this. He takes her life away from her step by ruthless step, because he is quite convinced that he owns her. As you can see by how upset I am, Liz Berry is a good writer who gets you involved with her characters -- but this book should have ended with revenge or escape. I shudder to think of people reading this when they were twelve years old.	2000-09-19

The fact that this book is out of print is a crime.  This is the first book L.J. Smith ever wrote and the best -- you get the benefit of her amazing writing style and wonderful plots without the required  romance. (I know some people like the romance, but the lack of it adds to  the suspense.)  Four children are called upon to free a trapped sorceress  and help stop a mad sorcerer from taking over earth.  The sorcerer lives in  another world which can only be entered through mirrors in the sorceress's  home.  Guided by the sorceress's familiar, a fox, they make several  terrifying ventures into the other world while trying to deal with problems  in their own world.  The characterization in this book is the best that  L.J. Smith has ever done, and the pace never lets up.	2000-07-19

All her friends are no longer interested in anything except a strange boy who calls himself WT-3 and something called \\"The Game.\\" Camden joins the group and plays The Game, but even as she is drawn into it she realizes that something is very wrong. Her friends are acting more and more like zombies, unable to speak English or think straight, and she feels vaguely as if something is being stolen from her. She only feels alert at night, when she has dreams about a Bronze Planet. Somehow, the dreams and The Game are connected... but how? <br />I read this book when I was very young and, seeing it recently in the library, remembered it instantly. It is a fast-paced science-fiction adventure with a great main character and touches of humor. I found it enthralling.	2000-07-11

Just yesterday (May 10) the New York Times ran an  article in its science section about DNA testing on certain markers in the  Y chromosome that are present in the majority of Jews in ALL communities --  Sephardic and Ashkenazic.  (The markers on Ethiopian Jews are not so  clear-cut.)  As the article itself stated, these tests finally disprove  theories that the majority of Ashkenazic Jews are descended from converts.   In fact, the studies show that a surprisingly SMALL number of Jews are  descended from converts -- less even than most Orthodox Jews would have  assumed.  I do not think there is anything &quot;less valid&quot; about  being descended from a convert, so Koestler's theory didn't bother me that  much even before I read about these tests.  But now that the book has been  so conclusively proven wrong, it should be reprinted with an appropriate  disclaimer.	2000-05-10

Each segment takes Rashi's commentary on one verse and  discusses it in a series of questions which the reader is supposed to try  to answer himself or herself before reading the author's suggested answer.   The temptation to just read without thinking is considerable, but if you  use this book properly it is an excellent study guide for Rashi (though not  recommended for complete beginners).  Very well done.	2000-04-09

It is different from other deserted-island stories because the children, who are  all observant Jews, decide that while they are on the island they will keep  all the Jewish laws to the best of their ability.

Strange things are happening on the distant planets where, in the far future, mankind has scattered.  Every planet has something oddly wrong with it.  On  one, people simply have no drive left; on another, the old rule the young;  on yet a third, women rule men (yes, it's faintly sexist, but don't let  that ruin a great book).  A group of adventurers go from planet to planet,  trying to find out what has caused this problem and barely escaping from  each planet with their lives.  Finally they make their way to old Earth...  and what's going on _there_ makes all the messed-up planets look like  paradises.  Only in a great book like this could the statement of a  mathematical formula make you gasp and drop the book.  (Well, I did.)  It's  a shame that this book is out of print, but I strongly recommend that you  find it somewhere!	2000-03-26

In this world, because  of the way  the earth revolves and rotates, the sun moves across the sky with agonizing  slowness.  It takes lifetimes for a region to experience dawn, midday and  dusk.  From generation to generation, the people of this world forget the  catastrophes that occur when the sun moves -- except for the  &quot;angels,&quot; people who have preserved the ancient knowledge and  work to try and save the other people from the destruction that threatens  them when the sun moves. The hero of this book, Knobil, was born among the  herdsmen, a savage race where the men kill each other and exile their sons  so that every man can have as many women and children as possible.  Knobil,  however, is the son of an angel, and his destiny soon takes him among all  the other people of his world -- the beautiful but mindless seafolk, the  cruel slavers, the wily traders, the terrible spinsters whose secret he  discovers nearly too late.	1999-05-03

The story is fascinating, and Scholem probably  knows more about it than almost anybody else in the world.  Although the  book is a &quot;historical&quot; book, not really intended for casual  reading, it is stirring in parts and not that hard to get through.  Scholem  has definite opinions about Shabtai -- e.g. how great a part Kabbalah  played in the movement, whether he really believed in himself as the  messiah -- that not all historians would agree with.  Still, this is a  worthwhile book.	1999-04-30

Using his own memories and insights, plus whatever tales and  legends he finds most interesting, he takes us through Hasidism from its  beginning through a lot of the Hasidic masters.  The subject is interesting  by itself, especially since many of the legends are profound or funny, and  Mr. Weisel's wonderful writing style is the perfect vehicle for it.

The writing is amazing and the historical details vivid -- but the main character is the most stupid, shallow, insipid creature I  have ever come across.  She leaves her faith and her people because she has  fallen in love with a Christian prince.  The main reason for her love seems  to be that said prince has blue eyes and good legs. She loses her virginity  to him after seeing him about three times, and then is shocked when he  leaves her.  The other characters are all stereotypes -- narrow-minded  rabbis and priests, spirited, beautiful young women, and domineering wives.   The latter two types of character persist despite the author's view that  everyone in Renaissance Italy hated women and was comitted to subjugating  them.  This book IS a fast-paced page-turner, so it makes a wonderful read  as long as you don't need any characters to identify with.	1999-02-21

I'm hoping that she'll write another one!	1999-01-10

I had to do some research on the subway system, so I dragged myself over to the library and grudgingly checked out a couple of books, figuring I would read them in small installments over  the course of several weeks.  Luckily for me, I opened this book first.  I  finished half of it before I went to bed that night.  The mixture of  personal life-stories, fascinating details and a great writing style makes  this one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read.	1999-01-01

As he tells it, the United Nations used to seat its delegates alphabetically: and so he, representing Ireland, found  himself sitting right between Israel and Iraq. This began his interest in  the history of Israel, and his research eventually produced this fantastic  book -- well-written, well-researched, and a pleasure to read.  The subject  matter itself is pretty interesting, and O'Brien has so many great  turns-of-phrase that I found myself underlining as I went along.  This book  is highly recommended to anyone who wants to find out more about how Israel  came to be.	1998-12-28

It is the only Arthurian book other than &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; that I was able to stay awake through.  Like Mists, The Child Queen has a female viewpoint -- but in this book the  viewpoint is Guinevere's, and she's a _good_ character.  McKenzie stays  away from all the standard fantasy cliches and makes the characters come  alive.  A great read.	1998-12-20

The High Queen lives up to the promise of The Child Queen.  Granted, the first chapter drags a little, but once you  get past that the author plunges right back in with adventure, drama,  romance... and most of all, characters that make the Arthurian legend come  to life.	1998-12-20

It is well-written, plus it has a good plot and characters you want to root for.  I definitely recommend it.

I'll have to explain exactly what it is: a journal kept by the author in the year after his father's death, in which  he researches, ruminates, and comments on Judaism.  The book is so intense  that I got the impression that he spent the entire year (a) saying kaddish  and (b) sitting in a tea room poring over ancient manuscripts.  It's a  privelege to get a chance to peek into the results of an entire year of  study -- not to mention the mind of the author, who at times is brilliant.   He is not trying to apologize for anything or to prove anything: he is  simply, and honestly, thinking.  This is not a book to be read in one  sitting; I found myself reading a few pages at a time and then thinking  about them.  But the book is so well-written that I was in no rush to  finish.	1998-12-16

No space monsters, no scientific concepts... it's not even written in first-person like most of his books are.  It's basically a suspense book.  But it's still good, and  it has a lot more characterization than most of his recent books.  It's  also &quot;deeper.&quot;  Whether that's a good thing or not is open to  question.	1998-12-06

That may be why I loved it so much.  Reading the other  reviews, it seems to me that a lot of people are simply reacting to the  fact that this book isn't his &quot;usual.&quot;  It may be set in the real  world instead of in a sword-and-sorcery neverland, but it's definitely  fantasy, and the characterization and suspense are top-notch.	1998-10-25

I can't read it in public or I'll embarass myself by bursting into laughter every couple of minutes. Rudy Miller is Korman's best character. A poker-faced loner with a cutting wit, he has been sent to camp by his well-meaning parents and is determined to do everything he can to escape back to civilization -- despite the fact that his perpetually cheerful counselor (and, before the book is over, every counselor in the camp) is determined to stop him. His new-found friend Webster, slightly bewildered, is dragged along for the ride; and so is the reader. This book is fantastic.	1998-10-23

While they were holed up with Eichmann in a safe house  in Argentina, the author found himself drawn to have conversations with  this person, to try and understand why he did what he did.  Reading these  conversations affected me so strongly, I can only imagine what the author  himself went through.  At one point, reading Eichman's reply to a question,  I threw the book across the room.  I couldn't even read it in one sitting,  despite the fact that it's extremely well-written.  At the end of the book  I still didn't understand Eichman -- or the Holocaust -- but I gained  something from reading it.  I recommend it highly.	1998-09-17

Hirsch	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Wonderful book	First of all, people looking for this book should know that there is  another translation out by Joseph Elias, published by Feldheim Publishers.   This came out recently so it should be easier to find.  In any case, Rabbi  Hirsch's great writing skills come out through any translation of his works  I have ever read.  Not only is this a fabulous introduction to his theory  of Judaism, it is so well-done that you'll keep going back to read certain  phrases or statements of ideas.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants  to learn more about Judaism, including those who already know a lot.	1998-09-17

Smith's other books, which have gotten much more hype than this one, are good but a little formulaic.  The Night of the Solstice, on the other hand, breaks all the molds.  I have read this book about ten times.  Those of you who love her other books already know about her fantastic writing style, but I'll bet you didn't know how original she could be -- or that she could write great characters who didn't fall into the &quot;spunky girl/reformed vampire&quot; category.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy her other books, but this one should be a classic.	1998-07-28

I picked up this book -- which is so long it could easily be made into a trilogy -- and didn't put it down for about three days.  Peters does a stunning job of drawing you into a long-ago world while at the same time not hitting you over the head with his research.  The characters and plot could stand alone even without the appeal of the pre-Columbian setting.	1998-06-12
