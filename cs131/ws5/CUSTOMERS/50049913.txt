Excellent account of life in pre-WW2 Poland and the devastating years of the war itself.  What is so remarkable is that the survival rate of this family was comparatively high compared to other Holocaust stories - mostly as a result of a family that saw the terror coming, and fleeing outside of the eventual jackboot sphere, with Diana's immediate family living precarious daily lives through their sheer wits in Nazi occupied Poland.  How remarkably easy reflect our own lives against these - just to be grateful and marvel at the human spirit, read and be grateful.	2004-04-29

Craig's book on the Battle of Stalingrad is as close as horrifying as the event it so magnificently sets out to depict.The German-Russo conflict of WW2 is the most ferocious war ever fought in the history of mankind.  It was a no holds barred war between two ideologies, both of whose take on human rights and life was a non-existent national policy.   Sadly for Hitler he did not exploit the welcome his armies received in many of the regions (they saw the Germans as liberators from the suppression of communism) and the subsequent ill-treatment and blatant slaughter of the population turned sentiments against the invaders; resulting in a very effective guerilla front being mounted within the occupied terrorities.  Craig's account epitomizes the full drama of total war.  Encircled by the Russians, cut off from their supply lines and in the grip of General Winter, and against express orders from Hitler himself not to break out, the 250000 German soldiers of the 6th Army, found themselves fighting, for the first time in their to-date triumphant war, a major defensive, door to door, building to building, battle to survive under the most horrendous conditions of cold, hunger, sleep deprivation, lice infestation, disease,<BR>artillery bombardment and depleting ammunition resources.   Of the 90000 Axis troops who eventually surrendered and went into<BR>captivity less than 5000, the majority of them only 12 years later, were destined to see Germany and their families again.  This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the major events that changed Hitler's successes in WW2.	2002-04-10

My fascination with WW2 and with the wonderful generation, on all sides of the fighting fronts, took again wings with this incredible account of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in the closing weeks of the war.  It sadly remains an event of WW2 that has not received its due coverage (like the explusion, immediately after the war, of between 13-14 million ethnic Germans from their ancient homelands in Easter Europe, resulting in more than 2 million deaths, and what is still the largest single refugee movement in European history; a fact that remains scarely known outside Germany - refer further hereto :Anthony Beevor's new book : Berlin:The Downfall 1945)  Full marks to Doug Stanton for bringing to us the horrifying story of this battleship disaster and the struggle for survival by the sailors, many of them mere boys, that took to the shark-infested seas that was going to become, in terms of pain, terror, fatigue and thirst, for four long long days, their unimaginable hell. The quotation \\"if you can't be grateful for what you receive...be thankful for what you escape\\" is given particular clarity when you read how these heroes, each and everyone, died or miraculously survived this catastrophe.	2002-04-05

It follows in detail Hitler's extraordinary rise from the gutters to the most feared, revered and hated man in modern history. It is all embracing - from the Versailles indignities, the war itself, the blitzkrieg of Western Europe, the Battle of the Atlantic, the initial triumphs on the Eastern Front to the total war that that front eventually became, to the horror of  the Holocaust. Don't miss this magnificently researched book by an author  who lived in Nazi Germany through its early formative and powerful 1930  era.  With Hitler's suicide now exactly 55 years ago it remains a timeless  study on an era that reshaped the world we now live in.  We all said it should never happen again - but it did in Yugoslavia some fifty years later,  proving that the human race has a tendency to repeat its history;  irrespective of past \\"lessons\\".	2000-04-30

Based on the Scopes trial of 1925 a young teacher is accused of teaching Darwin's evolution theory  in a USA school.

In desperation he is eventually  forced to put the prosecuting lawyer, a self professed religious expert, on  the stand and he takes him through a cross examination which touches sheer  brilliance.

Do yourself a favour and rent  the video starring Marsha Mason (Simon's ex-wife) The scene where Mason's  life is falling apart around her and she takes that first swill of the wine  glass is worthy, every bit worthy, of her Oscar nomination in this role.

The story takes you through the lives of the condemned depicting their respective  paths to this one way street.  When Mc Lendon takes you into the execution  chamber: the electric chair, you go into Dante's inferno and emerge  gasping.   You are warned this is not a read for the queasy : it packs a  lot of punch.	2000-02-19

I discovered this author in the 1960's when her &quot;the best of everything&quot; hit the best sellers list.   Once again her &quot;Class Reunion&quot; takes the female psych through their paces with a powerful  saga of the lives and loves of college students and the years thereafter.    The characters are very believable and we will all recognize someone from  our college days emerging from its pages. If you are truthful enough maybe  even yourself.	2000-02-16

The constant events of its pages and wonderful characters jump out at you and made me wish i could have written it.  I have read the author's other books but none have come anywhere near to matching the scope or adventure of  \\"Pillars\\" - it would make one hell of a movie.  Since books have a  tendency to go out of print I have bought a spare copy for my old age.	2000-02-15

Remember reading it on Clifton Beach in Cape Town roaring with laughter.  The other sunbathers thought i was dilly.   \\"A  Walk\\" did not disappoint me. I am myself only a day mountain hiker but  so much of what he described hit home like a hammer.  The book is  informative, it is funny and i look forward to the author's next work.   When i feel down i take one of his books and read a couple of the funniest  extracts and like magic, I am back smiling.   As i requested next  time you go please take me with you.	2000-02-15
