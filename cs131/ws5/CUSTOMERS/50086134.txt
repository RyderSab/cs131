Photographs are clear and demonstrate changes in molds over the course of time.  I would love to see an updated version, since this one stops at 1997.  Along with Felicia Crowell's &quot;Collectors' Guide,&quot; this book will help you enjoy and appreciate your Breyer collection even further.

Roberts relates how he began studying communication among horses as a young boy and eventually used that information to begin working with the animals.  Roberts, along with photographer Christopher Dydyk, creates a beautiful chronicle of how the horse he calls Shy Boy comes to trust people and become a valuable part of ranch life.  The climax of the story is when Roberts releases Shy Boy to the free-range herd where the horse had been living, to see how well the &quot;Join Up&quot; method has worked ... and Shy Boy comes home.  This is a beautiful book for anyone who loves horses and believes that gentleness and understanding are the key to relating to both animals and humans.	2002-05-09

This book fits the bill perfectly:  Juliet is a freeman's daughter in medieval England, and her friend is the manor-holder's daughter.  There is an excellent contrast shown between Juliet's lifestyle and that of her friend Marguerite.  The book also has an excellent lesson about honesty ... teaching the importance of this value without preaching about it is perfectly executed here.  <BR>I'm a reenactor by hobby, and wish that books like this had been available to me when I was a young girl growing up.  Parents who want their daughters to have a sense of history while still being entertained by good story lines should definitely investigate the Girlhood Journeys books.	2002-03-23

Folks looking for a &quot;quick cure&quot; are not likely to be satisfied with this particular outing.  However, folks looking to understand how society views those with depression, how folks with depression view society, and how the illness can also impact family members ... this is the place to go.  I read this book as part of a medical anthropology curriculum ... an ethnography of an illness ... and found it to be quite enlightening.  I have been in and out of treatment for depression myself over the years, and finding that so many people had similar experiences of reconstructing their self-view as a result of the illness was quite useful.  Again, this book is definitely not a &quot;quick fix&quot; or &quot;feel good&quot; kind of book ... it's one that looks at the nitty-gritty of one of the country's most prevalent illnesses and examines the minutiae therein.	2002-02-15

Allan's &quot;Scotland for Dummies&quot; is precisely that book. Allan gives readers the advantage of his experience as a traveller to all of Scotland's varied regions, sharing what's a hit and what should be missed.

He addresses the fact that premenopausal changes begin in the 30s, what sorts of things might be related, and gives frank, no-nonsense advice on how to manage menopause and premenopause without HRT.  Of particular interest in the section that explains why many doctors find HRT to be such a money-maker - including such things as hysterectomy, instant menopause, and so on.

Interestingly enough, MacGregor is a fairly minor character in the novel, appearing a mere handful of times and not initially identified.  The primary protagonist is a young student who keeps encountering MacGregor (&quot;a mysterious man in a dark cloak&quot;) in various situations and eventually, through various circumstances, meets him in the Highlands.  I would not view this book as anything other than a novel ... there is some historical accuracy, but it is deeply disguised in the telling of the tale.	2001-10-05

Those four simple words are at the root of the Disney business philosophy, established by Walt himself and carried on by Michael Eisner.  I found this book to be both entertaining and informative.  The business principles outlined by Capodagli and Jackson seem like simple, common sense - but bear repeating numerous times until more businesses adopt them.  Principles like encouraging innovation (and even failure, since you learn how *not* to do something) ... building on the strengths of your employees (development plans instead of demeaning performance appraisals) ... all will make any business work better.  I found numerous ideas here that I will be applying in my workplace as well as to my personal life.  This is a must-read for any manager who wants to motivate his or her team to really excel -- and for any employee who wants to be his or her personal best.	2001-10-04

The basic premise is that medieval linguist Grace, through various circumstances, travels back in time to meet Niall Dhu (&quot;Black Niall&quot;) Robertson, a former Knight Templar in the highlands of Scotland.  The chemistry between the two characters absolutely sizzles as they experience danger, intrigue ... and each other.  There is one section of this book which is most assuredly the most erotic thing I've ever read ... anyone who reads the novel will recognize the part I mean.  If you enjoy Highland history and/or romance novels, this is an excellent selection.	2001-09-28

My fiance and I are having a grand time looking for the bloopers cited for the various films (e.g., Gaston's disappearing and reappearing musket in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;).  I especially enjoyed seeing what original story lines were planned for each feature, and learning what scenes were removed because they didn't work.  If you are a fan of Disney's work, you will doubtless enjoy learning how the films might have been different.

We see some new faculty members at Hogwarts, including a new professor for Defense Against the Dark Arts who proves to be not-quite-as-he-seems.  There are several interesting plot twists involving Harry and his family, both Muggle and Magic, that came as a real surprise.

Brennan's investigative skills help her find the identity of the deceased, a 16-year-old girl, and also lead her to identify the killer. I am reluctant to give a way plot details as this is an absolutely wonderful police procedural/mystery novel and I would not want to spoil it for anyone.

The most interesting parts were the recipes/redactions and the instructions for medieval dance steps. There are also several pages that contain sheet music for period songs.

That's how engaging this book is. I finally acquired my own copy recently, and am now working my way through the entire Harry Potter series. There is something here for folks of all ages ... clever plots and humorous writing for the adults, and a group of heroes to whom children can relate. Rowlings is an extremely talented and entertaining author. I believe the Harry Potter books will help a lot of kids with self-esteem issues. From Harry's extremely humble beginning, living in a cabinet under the stairs in his step-parents' home, to becoming a wizard-in-training, the young hero demonstrates that kids can grow and become anything they want.

Thomas Malory's &quot;Morte d'Arthur&quot; is quite literally the &quot;jumping-off place&quot; for anyone who is interested in the legends of King Arthur.  This is the book that sets the scene for so many other novels concerning the same characters.  Here we are introduced to Tristan and Isolde, Lancelot, The Fisher King ... the &quot;usual&quot; cast of characters.  We develop some background understanding of their actions and motivations as a result of Malory's exposition.  This particular edition of the tales is translated into modern prose; I own another edition (published in the late 19th C.) that is more heavy going due to the stylized writing.  My only caveat on &quot;Morte d'Arthur&quot; is that the tales are not always linear.  Sometimes they represent things that are happening simultaneously, which may give the impression of the author jumping back and forth in time.  Try not to let that affect your ability to enjoy this classic.	2001-07-25

Many presumptions are made by the author, the most basic of which is that the reader already knows certain things about the characters.

I've read so many of Marion Zimmer Bradley's books that I honestly don't recall whether this was the first.  I suspect that it was, since the subject matter is of particular interest to me.  Bradley's view on the classic Arthurian cycle is presented from a new perspective:  that of Morgaine la Fey.  Morgaine is presented as a Druid priestess in this novel ... representing the Old Ways, and their juxtaposition with the new Christian faith.  In many ways, Morgaine is a victim of circumstance and the plotting of those around her ... a far more sympathetic view than is ordinarily given of Arthur's stepsister.  This novel is sometimes referred to as a &quot;feminist perspective on the Arthurian tales&quot; -- as though this were somehow damning.  I'm not certain that I find it entirely feminist ... just something like the other side of the story.  Highly recommended to those interested in Arthurian lore.	2001-07-25

I loaned it out so many times that I've had to replace it twice ... once due to wear and tear and once when it was not returned!  I have also read the book several times.  Bradley relates the familiar Arthurian legends from a completely different perspective -- that of Morgaine la Fey.  Morgaine is portrayed in a far more sympathetic light thanks to Bradley's somewhat pagan leanings; she represents the Old Religion in England.  This is a fresh and interesting take on a classic favorite, and belongs in a place of honor on any Arthurian's bookshelf.	2001-07-20

This is where we meet Tristan and Isolde, Bors de Ganis, Bedivere ... along with the usual &quot;biggies&quot; like Lancelot, Guenivere, etc.  This is a must-read if you want the best background on the tales and the characters.  However ... Malory's take on the tales is somewhat non-linear.  He tries to give the impression of things happening simultaneously - nearly impossible to accomplish in print.  I will admit that this is rather slow going ... but well worth the trouble it takes to finish.	2001-07-20

All three are very good, but this one is a little bit weak by comparison.  The focus of Tregarde's investigations is a photographer and his (literally) ageless trio of models ... all of them creating a ruckus among the local pagan folk.  A decent read with good suspense, but not quite up to Mercedes Lackey's usual standard of excellence.	2001-07-20

As a dedicated Yorkist and a member of the Richard III Society, I am constantly reading any work I can find about the Duke of Gloucester.  This book is a murder mystery that takes place at a weekend gathering of Ricardians in England.  Accidents begin to happen that echo Shakespeare's telling of Richard's alleged murders.  Each of the Ricardians in the novel plays a role from the Yorkist period ... one accident has the fellow playing George, Duke of Clarence, bound and stuffed into a barrel (to echo the alleged drowning of the unfortunate Duke in a butt of malmsey).  The reading is light and entertaining, and replete with well researched historical information.  It's on my Listmania &quot;Ricardian Reader's Library&quot; as a result.	2001-07-20

I found many very good ideas for helping me deal with past issues that have an impact on my current behavior (e.g., passive codependence, based on being told repeatedly in my youth that my opinions and desires did not matter).  Wright has a great many excellent, concrete suggestions for dealing with specific issues.  I recommend this very highly to anyone doing self-improvement, codependency, or inner child work.	2001-07-20

Steinbeck's book presumes that the reader does indeed have some background in the cycles, so there is not a great deal of character development or introduction.  That said, the tales are very easy to read as they are in more modern prose than Malory's &quot;Morte d'Arthur.&quot;  Interestingly enough, Steinbeck dedicates the book to his sister, whom he maintains would have been an excellent night.	2001-07-20

In December of 1999, I was planning my wedding. In February 2000, my then-fiance broke our engagement (and went on to marry someone else).  I was quite devastated by the breakup and went through many levels of anguish.  There were also lots of things for me to work on -- like, what I might have done to contribute to the breakup.  Fisher's &quot;Rebuilding&quot; theory was extremely useful.  Fisher uses the principle of building blocks to help work through each issue, or &quot;stumbling block.&quot;  One example that stuck with me was the &quot;stumbling block&quot; of &quot;I didn't do enough, or didn't try hard enough.&quot;  The &quot;rebuilding&quot; block was &quot;I did the best I could&quot;  While this may seem simplistic, the &quot;rebuilding blocks&quot; served as excellent reminders of the good things in life.  If you have suffered a relationship loss, please check out this book.  You will find many useful ideas, and will assuredly feel better as a result.	2001-07-19

While &quot;Braveheart&quot; made great cinematic entertainment, there were numerous instances of dramatic license taken.  MacKay writes honestly about the patriot's life and circumstances in this book.  From Wallace's education in the Abbey at Paisley (alongside Sir Alan de Cathcart and numerous others active in the Scottish wars of independence) to his execution by the English, this book is an excellent, accurate chronicle.	2001-07-08

I did find myself confused in a few places (and found this somewhat surprising as I am an historian by nature ... with a specialty in the Scottish wars of independence).  Otherwise, an excellent novel and very enjoyable.	2001-07-08

There are very few books available which address second (or more) weddings.  Everything seems to be geared to the young bride-to-be who has her family's &quot;golden checkbook&quot; for services.  Well, this book not only gives great advice on planning (etiquette, etc.)., but also lists resources for reasonably-priced invitations, gowns, etc.    The author's good humor shines through at all times -- she writes as though talking to a friend.  Highly recommended.	2001-07-05

I did find much of the information quite helpful, although the &quot;tube&quot; map was not up-to-date (thus causing me to subtract a star, as it didn't include the two newest lines).  Public transit is the way to go in London, so I hope the next edition will have the updated map.  At any rate, the book is helpful in selecting museums, restaurants and other places of interest.  If you are visiting London, I would recommend adding this book to a stack of other guides but not necessarily making it the only one you read.	2001-06-10

Then, I was confronted with some issues in my life that proved me wrong.  As is my wont, I immediately began to research &quot;inner child work&quot; and to do some.  This book was the most helpful of all that I read.  The author talks about the importance of integrating the &quot;child&quot; inside all of us with the &quot;adult&quot; -- bringing the emotional side of our lives into contact with the rational side.  I can honestly say that following this author's suggestions has had a huge, positive impact on my life.	2001-06-10

The audio version (unabridged) is read by Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus Derek Jacobi.  Anyway ... this book does a marvelous job of debunking some of the common myths about Richard III.  Tey's fictional detective Grant uses actual historical reference material to come to his own determinations about Richard III and the &quot;princes in the tower.&quot;  For a dedicated Ricardian such as myself, it's nice to see Richard portrayed in a different light.  He was very popular in life, and Tudor historians were the ones who painted him as a deformed villain.	2001-06-09

I thought that this audiobook would be a far better tool than it turned out to be.  I am in a serious, long-term relationship.  Due to some past problems (in other relationships), I hoped to learn some new skills.  Instead, I got some platitudes about the importance of forgiving your partner and being &quot;emotionally honest&quot; - couched in with a story of how one partner told the other he was contemplating cheating on her with a younger woman and how the three of them did these constant conference calls to figure out how to handle the situation.  I do agree that &quot;emotional honesty&quot; is important, but I already knew that.  I don't think that I would want to hang around if my partner looked me in the eye and announced that he was thinking of sleeping with someone else, and that ruined a lot of the authors' credibility for me.	2001-06-09

Ideas for meeting new people are important ... good ones can always be shared with friends.  This book didn't quite live up to my expectations.
