Penned by best-selling author David Mack, HARBINGER is an outstanding novel in its own right and the perfect introduction to a series with lots of promise. The story has all the necessary elements to hook you and hold you; a great concept and fascinating characters you want to know more about, whether or not you personally find them likable. <br /> <br />As you read you begin to realize that there are a multiple mysteries being set up within the narrative, the most obvious being what's so special about the Taurus Reach. By the end of the first chapter you are already intrigued by the ambiguities surrounding the station and as the story continues to build, the more you read the more you want to know.   <br /> <br />Vanguard has a large cast of characters, both principal and supporting, most of whom are all trying to get to the bottom of what's going on, each for a different reason.  Mack takes his time introducing the main characters, continuously building up an ever evolving picture of them as individuals.  The mix of characters provides a nice balance.  They aren't all Starfleet and they most definitely aren't what you'd expect. This approach to `casting' the series provides the reader with multiple points of view as events unfold.  The various characters feel real in their responses and reactions to the events they find themselves caught up in. Some of the characters you'll like, some you'll loathe but they are individually and collectively a fascinating bunch. <br /> <br />The time frame for Vanguard is firmly anchored by the use of a major point in Star Trek history, the Enterprise's disastrous mission to the barrier.  While Mack does sprinkle in various homage's to the TOS era, and address some discrepancies seen on screen between \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" and \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\", he never allows the Enterprise crew to take over the story, they are very much supporting characters in this first novel. <br /> <br />HARBINGER has it all; adventure, suspense, nail-biting action, character's you very quickly come to care about and the occasional twist to keep you on your toes.  Based on what has been set up in HARBINGER for future authors to expand on, I have no doubt that the Vanguard series is going to be a sensational addition to the Star Trek universe.  <br />	2005-08-08

Usually if I do, and it's a really good story, I'm left feeling a bit disappointed because I know I have to wait to find out where the story goes from here. <br /> <br />That wasn't the case with Cohesion.  Not because the story wasn't good, it's great, and Cohesion definitely did leave me wanting to know what happens next.  But at the same time, as I digested the final pages, I felt completely satisfied by the story and that's what impressed me most when I had finished reading Cohesion. <br /> <br />There is a lot to impress about the story told in Cohesion.  The plot is interesting and well paced, the action vividly portrayed and the characterizations of the Voyager characters the best I've read since Jeri Taylor's novel Pathways. <br /> <br />The interaction between B'Elanna Torres and Seven of Nine, who are reluctantly forced to work together to survive, is very amusing and one of the highlights of the story.  Lang also manages to address some of the inconsistencies in the way the characters were depicted in the television series, an accomplishment that fans of this series should find gratifying but luckily you don't need to be a fan of Voyager to enjoy Cohesion, just a reader who appreciates a really well told story. <br />	2005-07-28

As the year unfolds the reader is taken inside the day to day workings of the administration staff where we get to experience their struggles with the Federation Council, their mistakes, and their successes.  Who knew that politics could be so spellbinding? <br /> <br />In actuality \\"Articles of the Federation\\" is more than a novel about the politics of the Federation.  Rather it is a recounting of a series of crisis and potential crisis as viewed from the perspective of Federation politicians, bureaucrats and at times average citizens.  \\"Articles of the Federation\\" tells the story of how this particular administration chooses to deal with the various calamities they face.  <br /> <br />Nan Bacco and her staff spring from DeCandido's extremely fertile mind and were first introduced in his novel \\"A Time for War, a Time for Peace\\" which was published last October.  They are a very appealing group of characters who you very quickly feel sympathy for and want to see succeed and they elucidate the notion that a leader is only as good as those they choose to surround themselves with.  Bacco herself is the most noteworthy; witty, intelligent and at the beginning of her term a bit naive.  When it comes to interstellar politics however she proves to be a quick study and more than up to the task. <br /> <br />The way DeCandido has chosen to structure the plot of \\"Articles of the Federation\\" is one of the reasons the novel works so well.  It would be very easy to become overwhelmed by the numerous plot threads and large cast of characters but by breaking the overall story down into six distinct parts the reader is never inundated with too much at once.  The action and events flow along quickly but the narrative is never rushed and the transitions are seamless. <br /> <br />I could go on at length about the numerous reasons that \\"Articles of the Federation\\" is an outstanding novel, the many ways it is both original and exceedingly entertaining.  Based on the authors previous writings by the time I had finished reading \\"Articles of the Federation\\" I became firmly convinced that DeCandido is incapable of writing an archetypal Star Trek novel.  He has demonstrated time and again that he has too much talent and imagination to be predictable.  With \\"Articles of the Federation\\" he has cemented that reputation. <br />	2005-06-09

Thoroughly engaging from beginning to end the story satisfies on every level.  Martin and Mangels were handed a difficult task when asked to write this novel.  The authors must not only tell a well plotted and exciting story that leaves you wanting more but they must also introduce and start to develop the major characters as well as establish the ship itself, the U.S.S. Titan.  They handle everything with great skill and with style. <br /> <br />The character line up in \\"Taking Wing\\" reads like a who's who of Star Trek alien species.  Several familiar characters firmly anchor the character roster including Alyssa Ogawa, Melora Pazlar, Christine Vale, and Ranul Keru and of course, Riker's wife Deanna Troi.  But it is the characters we are introduced to in the story that help make the potential for this series so apparent.  There are characters from species we are already very familiar with but who are seen in Taking Wing from a whole new perspective, like the female Ferengi Bralik or the young Cardassian cadet Dakal, and species that come entirely from the fertile imaginations of the authors such as the raptor-like Dr. Ree Titan's CMO. <br /> <br />All those fascinating characters and many more are introduced in a story full of twists and turns as the Titan travels across the neutral zone with an escort of Klingons to take on their maiden assignment and it's a big one.  Help restore order and peace to a fragmented Empire who has long considered you an enemy despite your recent alliance during the Dominion War, a daunting task indeed.   <br /> <br />As the plot unfolds you begin to doubt that the authors have thought of a plausible way to conclude the story as things go from bad to worse and you realize you're almost at the end of the book when they astonish you once again with a very clever resolution.  The ending will definitely leave you wanting more and anticipating what might be to come. <br /> <br />It is always very rewarding when a book you've been anticipating lives up to expectations.  It's even better when the book exceeds them.  \\"Star Trek Titan: Taking Wing\\" is a superb debut for an original new series. <br />	2005-05-21
US	52025410	R2BGFBUW9X40KO	0743457625	675832121	From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy	Books	4	71	74	N	N	Inspirational and Moving	When you finish reading a really well done biography, you are left feeling as if you have gotten to `know' the subject of the book.  As if you have not only gained insight into the person, but also the era in which they lived and the factors that helped shape their life.  Based on that criterion, From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy by Terry Lee Rioux is better than well done; it is excellent. <br /> <br />For most of us, when we think of DeForest Kelley, we think of \\"Bones\\" McCoy but Jackson DeForest Kelley already had over 20 years in Hollywood under his belt before Gene Roddenberry tapped him to play the crusty southern doctor on Star Trek.  Terry Lee Rioux traces that career through its ups and downs, all the while building a portrait of a gentle, caring man of deep beliefs and strong convictions.  Meticulous research and countless hours of interviews with numerous friends and collegues who were close to the Kelley's have enabled Rioux to provide a revealing narrative that is rich with previously unknown details about DeForest Kelley's life and career. <br /> <br />Despite his humble beginnings in Conyers, Georgia, De Kelley had big dreams.  He took his first steps toward realizing those dreams as a member of the Long Beach Community Players and gradually learned his craft under the ever looming shadow of war.  His service in World War II, his marriage to Carolyn, the years of struggle as a contract player at Paramount and the failure of the studio system are all covered in the first two parts of the four parts that make up the book. <br /> <br />A fortune teller once predicted that De's real success would come after he turned 40, and indeed DeForest Kelley was contemplating retirement when Gene Roddenberry came calling.  At 46 years of age he reported for work on Star Trek on May 23, 1966 hoping the show would last the seven episodes he had contracted for.  The rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br />From Sawadust to Stardust is not your typical Hollywood biography.  It is an impressive piece of scholarship and writing that has broad appeal beyond the obvious allure it will hold for Star Trek fans.  Inspirational and moving, it is an outstanding portrait of a true gentleman, Jackson DeForest Kelley, the kind of person you would be proud to know, and if you read From Sawdust to Stardust, you will `know' DeForest Kelley. <br />	2005-02-16

Still reeling from their encounter with V'Ger and the sacrifice of Captain Willard Decker, the crew of the Enterprise has barely had time to begin to come to grips with those events when Dr. Leonard McCoy receives a plea for help from someone he hadn't expected to ever hear from again, his ex-wife Natira, the former high priestess of the Fabrini.  Since settling on Daran IV, a world they call Lorina, the former inhabitants of the worldship Yonada have become divided by what they see as conflicting ideologies, a conflict that has now turned violent.   <br /> <br />Thought provoking stories are one of the hallmarks of Star Trek and stories rarely get more thought provoking than Ex Machina.  It would be easy to just categorize Ex Machina as a follow-up to Star Trek: The Motion Picture and the classic episode \\"For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\\" and of course it is, but it is also more than that, much more.  What Christopher L. Bennett has done with Ex Machina is to meld together the themes of both into a story cannot help but resonate with anyone who has ever read a history book or a newspaper. <br /> <br />Ex Machina is also a heck of a lot of fun to read.  The narrative is liberally sprinkled with homage's to multiple incarnations of Star Trek, including the novels, and reads like a who's who of Star Trek alien species.  At the time of Star Trek: The Motion picture the crew of the Enterprise was the most diverse Starfleet had ever assembled and Bennett takes full advantage of that.  Bennett goes way beyond just mentioning the species; he takes the time to allow us to get to know them. <br /> <br />As impressive as Mr. Bennett's world building efforts are in Ex Machina he never loses sight of the characters, and it is his depiction of those characters that makes the whole thing work.  Taking into account not only the effect of the events of Star Trek: The Motion Picture on the individual characters but also of the novels set between the final episode of TOS and the first movie, several of the main characters are at a crossroad in their lives and uncertain about the direction their lives are taking. <br /> <br />Ex Machina is refreshing, interesting and contributes a great deal to the already rich Star Trek universe.  Based on this impressive debut I can't wait to see other contributions Christopher L. Bennett makes to that universe in the years to come. <br />	2005-02-06

At the same time, these volumes advance the post-finale storylines.  In Volume Two, the worlds explored are Trill in \\"Unjoined\\" by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels and Bajor in \\"Fragments and Omens\\" by newcomer J. Noah Kym. <br /> <br />At the end of Unity, Trill society stands on the edge of an abyss.  The parasites have been destroyed but the ramifications of the cover-up by the Trill government reverberate throughout the planet and Trill society.  \\"Unjoined\\" begins with Dr. Julian Bashir in the middle of bedlam and then proceeds to explain how he got there, how the chaos he and Ezri Dax find themselves caught up in came to be. <br /> <br />\\"Unjoined\\" is a beautifully constructed story that explores Trill's previously hidden history by carefully taking into account everything previously established about the planet and it's culture and expanding upon it in a very creative and interesting way.  With the very fabric of their civilization being torn apart, the inhabitants of Trill find themselves in a desperate fight for the future of their society, a fight they may be unable to win. <br /> <br />\\"Fragments and Omens\\" has a much more hopeful tone.  Set shortly after Bajor's admission to the Federation there is still much work to be done helping Bajor become a fully integrated member of the Federation.  J. Noah Kym successfully employs several different storylines and characters to weave together a descriptive and evocative story that provides the reader with a much broader picture of Bajor and its people than we have sometimes been given in the past. <br /> <br />You are likely to feel a bit lost if you attempt to read any of the volumes of Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine without having read the previously published novel Unity.  The six stories contained in these three volumes are in many respects an interlude.  They carry the story forward from Unity, wrapping up some of the ongoing storylines not fully concluded in that novel while introducing new story threads. <br /> <br />At the conclusion of both \\"Unjoined\\" and \\"Fragments and Omens\\", the characters have been brought to the point where they are ready to move forward with their lives leaving the reader eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold.  <br />	2005-02-02
US	52025410	R3POQ8OV17S856	0743483537	665765683	Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Vol. 3, The Dominion and Ferenginar	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Simply Outstanding	As enjoyable and satisfying as the four previous stories told in Volumes One and Two of Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine are, Volume Three saves the best for last and packs quite a punch.  Volume three brings together the Ferenginar story, \\"Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed\\" by Keith R.A. DeCandido with the final tale \\"Olympus Descending\\", a story of the Dominion by David R. George III. <br /> <br />In \\"Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed\\", it comes as no surprise to learn that Quark is not the only Ferengi who is not pleased with direction that the recent reforms is taking their society.  When Grand Nagus Rom finds himself in the middle of a no holes barred fight for his political future, Rom and Ro Lauren accompany Quark home to Ferenginar in an attempt to get to the bottom of serious accusations leveled against Rom. <br /> <br />With \\"Satisfaction is No Guaranteed\\" Keith DeCandido demonstrates that he knows his Ferengi every bit as well as the Klingons with a serious story that still manages to be rousing good fun.  The predicament Rom finds himself in is uniquely Ferengi as is the solution. <br /> <br />\\"Olympus Descending\\" is a different kettle of fish entirely, an introspective tale that explores the nature of the changelings existence.  While Odo, and his search for answers about his people and their history may be the focus of the story, the author also manages to clarify a lot about the Jem'Hadar and the Vorta along the way adding a good deal to our understanding of both species. <br /> <br />The story starts slowly, evolving into a tale that is entirely engrossing and at times shocking.  The author pulls off more than one very neat little writing trick with great expertise.  David George's writing style strives to allow the reader to wholly immerse themselves not only in the events and surroundings that the characters are experiencing, but also to illuminate how they feel about it, and what the ramifications for them may be.   <br /> <br />Each of these volumes has the \\"acknowledgements\\" and standard \\"about the author\\" sections run before each story, instead of at the end of the book as they usually do and there is a very good reason for that.  Many readers read those sections before they begin a book and in the case of these stories, most particularly this final volume, turning to the back might mean you inadvertently see the final sentences.  Whatever you do, don't turn to the back of the book, not even to peruse the included chronology of events.  Save it for last and savor the bombshell. <br /> <br />You can't really characterize Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Volume Three as a conclusion; these books are after all, not a trilogy.  Rather they are three books that feature six separate stories that are part of one larger whole.  However, you can easily characterize Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Volume Three, indeed all three volumes, as an outstanding addition to this bestselling series. <br />	2005-02-02
US	52025410	R2K4GDLUA0HCP3	0743457110	847530116	0: To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh (Star Trek)	Books	5	45	47	N	N	Exceptional Story--Compelling and Tragic	A few years ago author Greg Cox brilliantly depicted Khan's backstory in the two volumes of his bestselling \\"The Eugenics Wars\\" novels.  Now Cox has done it again as he wraps up his ambitious triptych with the exceptional new novel \\"To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh\\". <br /> <br />Greg Cox grabs your attention on the opening page and sets the stage for the enthralling and tragic tale of Khan's years on Ceti Alpha V.  Cox has once again chosen to use a framing story around flashbacks, the same storytelling technique he used so effectively in his previous Kahn novels.  In \\"To Reign in Hell\\", however, Cox wisely keeps the framing story very simple and allows Kahn himself to tell the tale. <br /> <br />Set immediately after the conclusion of \\"Star Trek: The Voyage Home\\", Kirk, burdened by guilt and seeking answers travels back to Ceti Alpha V accompanied by Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Sulu.  Hidden on the planet they discover a journal kept by Kahn that chronicles the fifteen years that Kahn, Marla McIvers and Kahn's genetically engineered followers spent on the doomed planet.  The exiles struggle for survival is poignantly and graphically depicted as the fledgling colony endures a constant stream of tragic disappointment, and bitterness and sorrow ultimately chip away at Khan's sanity. <br /> <br />With \\"To Reign in Hell\\" Greg Cox has skillfully taken the small amount of material established in \\"Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn\\" and spun a spellbinding and heartbreaking tale that manages to clarify all sorts of continuity inconsistencies and a myriad of small details such as why Kahn's hand is covered with a glove.  In the face of everything Khan maintains his arrogance.  Cox absolutely nails the character, which comes as no surprise, after all he knows him intimately by now.  It would have been quite easy for Khan's personality to overshadow the story but it never does.  Kahn's ruthlessness and sense of superiority is nicely balanced by the other characters, especially that of his wife Lieutenant Marla McIvers. <br /> <br />The tone and pacing of the plot is perfect and I particularly enjoyed the classical references scattered effectively throughout the story.  We all know how Khan's story ends, but despite that the compelling narrative draws you in and keeps the reader mesmerized allowing the ironic twist at the end to come as a complete surprise.  The end also ties in very nicely with \\"The Eugenics Wars\\" novels although it is not necessary to have read those volumes to completely enjoy and appreciate the story Cox tells in \\"To Reign in Hell\\". <br /> <br />\\"To Reign in Hell\\" is a phenomenal story in and of itself and an extraordinary conclusion to the saga of Kahn Noonien Singh that Cox began with \\"The Eugenics Wars\\". <br />	2005-01-06

It is not often that I read a story anthology and can honestly say that I enjoyed every one.  I can say that about TALES OF THE DOMINION WAR.  Each and every story has something singular to offer. <br /> <br />Featuring stories from a wide range of popular authors, TALES OF THE DOMINION WAR is one of this years must read Star Trek titles.  Edited by Keith R.A. DeCandido this anthology gathers together twelve stories that span the Star Trek universe and provide for the reader a unique overview of the war and the fight to protect the Alpha quadrant from the overwhelming forces of the Dominion and their allies. <br /> <br />There are stories that illuminate events we know took place but we never got much detail on such as one of the pivotal moments of the war, the fall of Betazed.  Keith R.A. DeCandido takes it upon himself to place the reader on Betazed when it falls under Dominion attack in \\"The Ceremony of Innocence is Drowned\\".  Through Lwaxana Troi we experience the lightening quick attack against an almost defenseless population. <br /> <br />Another crucial moment in the war was the Breen attack against Earth.  Both \\"Eleven Hours Out\\" by Dave Galanter and Howard Weinstein's \\"Safe Harbors\\", a sweet little story that perfectly captures the camaraderie between Scotty and McCoy, tackle the Breen attack but from totally different perspectives.  \\"Eleven Hours Out\\", set on Earth during the attack, provides not only a vivid description of the destruction and the aftermath of the attack but also manages to be a nice character piece for Jean-Luc Picard. <br /> <br />In Star Trek: Nemesis we were introduced to a clone named Shinzon and told that he served the Romulan Empire with distinction during the Dominion War.  In \\"Twilight's Wrath\\" David Mack not only tells Shinzon's tale but also manages to clear up some of that movies other incongruities. <br /> <br />As agreeable as it is to have events we've wondered about clarified, the stories that don't elucidate previously known events were just as enjoyable for their distinctiveness.  \\"Night of the Vulture\\" by Greg Cox has an entirely different tone.  With a palpable sense of menace Cox spins a tale that cleverly utilizes his unique storytelling gifts, the Jem'Hadar, and an old menace, the Beta XII-A entity. <br /> <br /> \\"Blood Sacrifice\\" by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz takes us to Romulus where on the eve of the Romulans entry into the war Ambassador Spock finds himself trying to unravel the mysterious motivation behind the assassination of the Romulan Emperor. <br /> <br />\\"Mirror Eyes\\" marks the first time that Heather Jarman and Jeffrey Lang have collaborated on a story.  Based on \\"Mirror Eyes\\" I certainly look forward to anything else these two should come up with.  Told in first person, through the journal entries of a Tal Shiar agent working undercover on Deep Space 9, \\"Mirror Eyes\\" is both riveting and poignant. <br /> <br />Some of the stories utilize literary based characters such as \\"Field Expediency\\" by Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore that features the crew of U.S.S. da Vinci from the Starfleet Corps Engineers series in a story that perfectly captures the spirit of that series. <br /> <br />In a nod to the Stargazer series \\"What Dreams May Come\\" by Michael Jan Friedman opens the volume with a story set early in the war where nothing is quite as it seems.  Told from the perspective of Sejeel, a pampered Vorta who has been lulled into a sense of complacency, \\"What Dreams May Come\\" is classic Michael Jan Friedman. <br /> <br />Robert Greenberger's \\"A Song Well Sung\\" highlights Commander Klag of the I.K.S. Gorkon in the ultimate survivors tale while Peter David spins a fantastical New Frontier story, \\"Stone Cold Truths\\", that only he could tell. <br /> <br />Rounding out the volume is the final story \\"Requital\\" by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels.  Set concurrently with Deep Space Nine's final episode \\"What You Leave Behind\\", for me this story was the saddest and most difficult to read because you can't help but recognize the parallels to our own world. <br /> <br />Twelve stories and not a dud in the bunch, TALES OF THE DOMINION WAR is a very satisfying read indeed.	2004-07-26
US	52025410	R2OWFC6B9HXHMM	0743462858	154624477	A Time to Love (Star Trek: the Next Generation)	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Finally this series is going somewhere	The A Time to... series of novels have been a bit underwhelming thus far but in &quot;A Time to Love&quot; and &quot;A Time to Hate&quot; the series begins to come into it's own with the strongest pair of novels yet.  It doesn't require non-stop action and excitement to provide an absorbing tale, although both these novels have their share of tension and conflict.  Robert Greenberger takes the simple and straightforward approach of letting the characters be the center of the story, which makes for an extremely rewarding read.<br />Jointly colonized a hundred years ago by two violent races previously hostile to each other, the Bader and the Dorset, the Federation member world Delta Sigma IV has always been a model of interspecies cooperation.  When it was discovered that a naturally occurring gas is shortening the inhabitant's life spans it seemed as if Starfleet Medical had found a counter agent.  But someone has seriously miscalculated and the Enterprise-E is assigned to investigate when mysterious outbreaks of violence seem to be linked to the treatment.  <br />To complicate matters, Kyle Riker, William Riker's estranged father, the man who headed the Federation delegation working to study and resolve the medical issues of the Bader and Dorset, is missing and he aims to stay that way.  The situation quickly dissolves from bad to calamitous as escalating violence begins to spread across the planet and the governing council proves to be incapable of making any decisions.  Called upon to provide everything from medical aid and security to damage control and repair teams for an entire planet whose population is hostile to each other and to them, the crew of the Enterprise soon realize that they can't hold the planet together for long.  <br />Knowing they are on their own, Beverly Crusher works franticly but when she does unravel the mystery behind what has been triggering the long-suppressed aggression of the Bader and Dorset, the answer just provokes more questions.Speed is of the essence and finding a solution must take priority, and when a solution is found it is far from ideal.  To save the populace of Delta Sigma IV, Picard must also condemn them.<br />As &quot;A Time to Love&quot; opens Captain Picard, and by extension his crew, are still laboring under the shadow of their encounter with the \\"demon ship\\" (&quot;A Time to be Born&quot;, &quot;A Time to Die&quot;).  Now considered a liability by many at Starfleet Command this latest is just another in a string of what one Admiral called \\"lousy assignments\\" meant to try to nudge Picard toward retirement.  Beverly Crusher is contemplating a return to Starfleet Medical and Riker and Troi have started to give serious consideration to their own futures.<br />Given everything that has gone on in the characters lives over the course of the first four novels of this series it is refreshing to have Greenberger focus on the characters and their relationships with each other.  It gives the reader an opportunity to really get to know each character a bit more at this point in their lives; the years have brought changes to them all.  The years have also meant new crew members, characters we don't know as well, and these two novels also provide an opportunity to get to know several characters like security chief Christine Vale a whole lot better.<br />There is a lot going on in &quot;A Time to Love&quot; and &quot;A Time to Hate&quot;.  Several sub plots weave themselves together into one cohesive whole.  &quot;A Time to Love&quot; starts out a bit slowly as each of the numerous character arches are established but once that is accomplished the story begins to pick up momentum.  One of the strongest sub plots is Will Rikers hunt for his father, that storyline supplies much of the mystery and intrigue but also builds on everything we already know about their relationship.

It doesn't require non-stop action and excitement to provide an absorbing tale, although both these novels have their share of tension and conflict. Robert Greenberger takes the simple and straightforward approach of letting the characters be the center of the story, which makes for an extremely rewarding read.<br />Jointly colonized a hundred years ago by two violent races previously hostile to each other, the Bader and the Dorset, the Federation member world Delta Sigma IV has always been a model of interspecies cooperation. When it was discovered that a naturally occurring gas is shortening the inhabitant's life spans it seemed as if Starfleet Medical had found a counter agent. But someone has seriously miscalculated and the Enterprise-E is assigned to investigate when mysterious outbreaks of violence seem to be linked to the treatment. <br />To complicate matters, Kyle Riker, William Riker's estranged father, the man who headed the Federation delegation working to study and resolve the medical issues of the Bader and Dorset, is missing and he aims to stay that way. The situation quickly dissolves from bad to calamitous as escalating violence begins to spread across the planet and the governing council proves to be incapable of making any decisions. Called upon to provide everything from medical aid and security to damage control and repair teams for an entire planet whose population is hostile to each other and to them, the crew of the Enterprise soon realize that they can't hold the planet together for long. <br />Knowing they are on their own, Beverly Crusher works franticly but when she does unravel the mystery behind what has been triggering the long-suppressed aggression of the Bader and Dorset, the answer just provokes more questions. Speed isof the essence and finding a solution must take priority, and when a solution is found it is far from ideal. To save the populace of Delta Sigma IV, Picard must also condemn them.<br />As &quot;A Time to Love&quot; opens Captain Picard, and by extension his crew, are still laboring under the shadow of their encounter with the \\"demon ship\\" (&quot;A Time to be Born&quot;, &quot;A Time to Die&quot;). Now considered a liability by many at Starfleet Command this latest is just another in a string of what one Admiral called \\"lousy assignments\\" meant to try to nudge Picard toward retirement. Beverly Crusher is contemplating a return to Starfleet Medical and Riker and Troi have started to give serious consideration to their own futures.<br />Given everything that has gone on in the characters lives over the course of the first four novels of this series it is refreshing to have Greenberger focus on the characters and their relationships with each other. It gives the reader an opportunity to really get to know each character a bit more at this point in their lives; the years have brought changes to them all. The years have also meant new crew members, characters we don't know as well, and these two novels also provide an opportunity to get to know several characters like security chief Christine Vale a whole lot better.<br />There is a lot going on in &quot;A Time to Love&quot; and &quot;A Time to Hate&quot;. Several sub plots weave themselves together into one cohesive whole. &quot;A Time to Love&quot; starts out a bit slowly as each of the numerous character arches are established but once that is accomplished the story begins to pick up momentum. One of the strongest sub plots is Will Rikers hunt for his father, that storyline supplies much of the mystery and intrigue but also builds on everything we already know about their relationship. Fans of the William Riker and Deanna Troi romance will no doubt be satisfied by the direction their lives take in these novels.<br />In case I've given you the impression that the story is all about the characters let me assure you that these two novels aren't without action sequences, although primarily it is hand-to-hand combat and the majority of the action takes place in &quot;A Time to Hate&quot;. As you read you also begin to get an inkling that there is something more than meets the eye going on with regards to the Bader and Dorset's medical issues but the major plot twist in the final pages of &quot;A Time to Hate&quot; still comes as a complete and shocking surprise.<br />&quot;A Time to Love&quot; and &quot;A Time to Hate&quot; finally have this series heading in the right direction.	2004-06-29
US	52025410	R2U9YSGNOPW45N	0743483510	655362764	Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Worlds of Deep Space Nine #1: Cardassia and Andor	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Spectacular	\\"Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\\" are intended to immerse the reader in the cultures of the chosen planets and allow the reader to experience those societies from a familiar characters point of view.  At the same time the Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine advances the post-finale storylines.  Both stories in volume one definitely succeeded in doing both of those things in spectacular fashion.  <br />Una McCormack transports us to Cardassia in \\"The Lotus Flower\\" where Keiko O'Brien has accepted a position to head up an important agricultural renewal project.  The recovery and reconstruction efforts are continuing slowly when the O'Brien family, Vedek Yevir and other innocents become pawns in a dangerous political game instigated by those on Cardassia who are opposed to the leadership of Ghemor.  Garak, an old hand at playing such games, must call on all of his skills to avert a tragedy that could spell the end of hope of a democratic future for Cardassia.<br />In many respects Una McCormack has the more difficult job in this first volume of Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and she definitely rises to the occasion.  Life on Cardassia has been portrayed before, while Andor is another kettle of fish entirely, it's more of a clean slate.  McCormack builds on what has already been established about Cardassia and does a wonderful job of allowing the reader to catch glimpses of what Cardassian society had been like before the Dominion War, while at the same time portraying what they are experiencing now.<br />The short chapters really kept the story moving along at a very fast pace and make it seem a bit shorter than it actually was.  McCormack does a very good job of illustrating her theme: the idea that major change can be very frightening and that fear can leave people, particularly children, vulnerable to manipulation.  She also succeeds in driving home the point that politics can be a very dangerous and cold-blooded game.  <br />What I enjoyed the most about \\"The Lotus Flower\\" was McCormack's characterization of Garak.  It is outstanding.  She's got him down cold and I found myself missing the character very much indeed when I finished. There are also several sweet and effective character moments for the O'Brien's.  <br />The prose is a pleasure to read and very straight forward.  Most of the time the narrative is quite evocative but it's a bit uneven.  The Garak scenes were the strongest.  You can clearly tell she loves the character and understands him well.  There is a whole `men in the shadows' element to the story that allows a sense of mystery and menace to creep in and McCormack does an excellent job of using that to build suspense.<br />In the second story, \\"Paradigm\\", Heather Jarman paints a portrait of Andor that you won't soon forget.  Shar, Ensign Thirishar ch'Thane, returns home to Andor to face the consequences of his choices but he doesn't travel alone.  Ensign Prynn Tenmei and Lieutenant Commander Phillipa Matthias accompany Shar and the trio arrives on Andor as the society stands on the edge of an abyss.  To save their species, the Andorians may be forced to make tough choices, choices that may save them as a race but destroy their culture.<br />\\"Paradigm\\" is a very impressive piece of fiction.  Heather Jarman's narrative is so rich and vivid that it's quite easy to become lost in the story.  As the story unfolds the tension builds continuously providing moments of satisfying release before it builds again.  It is like being on a thrill ride that gives you moments to catch your breath before it races off again.  <br />World building is something Jarman excels at and in \\"Paradigm\\" she provides a duel look at Andor and Andorian society that works perfectly by giving the reader both the point of view of a native of the planet and a visitor.  Shar, in his role as tour guide provides one perspective, but we also get to see Andorian society from Prynn's outsider looking in position as she struggles to understand the complex culture.  <br />There are also moments of lightness and clever inclusions, for example Jarman's way of handling the name of the planet issue and those curious about Andorian sexuality will certainly be satisfied.  The issue is handled very tastefully.  A glossary of Andorian terms at the end of the book comes in quite handy if all the alien pronouns confuse you as much as they do me. <br />Although \\"The Lotus Flower\\" comes first in \\"Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\\", it doesn't matter what order you read the two novellas. Chronologically \\"Paradigm\\" is set before \\"The Lotus Flower\\".  Each story stands on it's own merits and each is outstanding in its own way.	2004-06-10

Each of the three flashback stories is a complete and interesting story on their own.  Ward and Dilmore know how to engage your attention from the opening paragraph of a novel and spin a highly entertaining tale.<br />Originally released as an eBook trilogy in 2002, as a full-length novel Foundations is an even more effect story without the recapping needed when a story is broken down into individual parts.  Well paced and carefully plotted, &quot;Foundations&quot; is mighty satisfying reading in a number of ways.<br />The 24th century framing story effectively sets up each jump back to the past while at the same time provides it's own interesting dilemma.  Using the same characters, the crew of the USS Lovell, in each of the three flashbacks provides continuity and good flow to the overall narrative while at the same time allowing the reader to get to know and appreciate the characters, particularly Commander Mahmud al-Khaled.  Al-Khaled, like the da Vinci's Commander Sonya Gomez, commands a crew of unique individuals you can't help but like.<br />Ward and Dilmore have a real knack for writing dialogue that very effectively brings the individual characters to life.  <br />If you are not already a follower of this popular series, then give &quot;Foundations&quot; a try. It's a perfect opportunity to be introduced to a wonderful set of characters that fulfill a distinctive role and provide a fresh and unusual perspective to the Star Trek universe.  Best of all, it's a fun read.	2004-04-09
US	52025410	R3MLHXUYPFISEQ	0743464974	106863737	The Case of the Colonist's Corpse: A Sam Cogley Mystery (Star Trek: the Original Series)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Good Characters but Lacks Drama	&quot;The Case of the Colonist's Corpse&quot; by Bob Ingersoll and Tony Isabella is a departure from the usual Star Trek novel in one very obvious way.  As the title implies, &quot;The Case of the Colonist's Corpse&quot; is a mystery, a Perry Mason style mystery.  The story isn't nearly as dramatic or suspenseful as a genuine Earl Stanley Gardner story but it is still an enjoyable read, carefully plotted with well-drawn characters.  <br />When you begin reading &quot;The Case of the Colonist's Corpse&quot; you already know whom that corpse will be and who will be accused.  Following Earl Stanley Gardner's classic template authors Bob Ingersoll and Tony Isabella introduce the main characters and step by step set the stage for the murder.  They provide plenty of suspects, carefully establishing who would have cause to want Latham out of the way. Daniel Latham as a character is the perfect victim for evoking in the reader a sense of outrage at his untimely demise.  He is a man that is both likable and honorable.<br />The whole point to this type of mystery is that the reader already knows that the accused is innocent and the fun lies in trying to pick out the subtle clues along the way and guess `who done it' before the denouement of the real culprit at the climax of the story.  My main dissatisfaction with &quot;The Case of the Colonist's Corpse&quot; was that that climax came much too swiftly.  The courtroom scenes were very short and fast paced.  <br />By wrapping it up so quickly and easily the most interesting character in the story, Sam Cogley, didn't get as much of an opportunity to shine in the courtroom setting as I would have liked.  I was looking forward to some theatrics and a bit more drama.  That being said Sam Cogley, as a character was still a treat to read.  Brilliant, eccentric and devoted to justice Cogley is a 20th century man living in the 23rd century.<br />Set during the second season of the original series Kirk and crew do make an appearance buttheir role is limited.  &quot;The Case of the Colonist's Corpse&quot; is not a story that requires familiar characters to make it work and that is one of the most refreshing aspects of this novel.  You are certainly aware that you are reading a Star Trek novel, but at the same time you don't have to have an intimate familiarity with any of the characters to appreciate the story.	2004-01-29

It is never as simple as who, what, when and where. Bonanno weaves her storytelling spell with multiple layers of mystery.  She takes the reader back and forth between the current crisis and the past, where the foundations of a complex plot were methodically laid, allowing the `how' to be one of the most riveting elements of the plot.<br />Margaret Wander Bonanno has always demonstrated an ability to write particularly strong female characters.  The women who populate her writing are complex and compelling and it is an absolute delight to see what she does with Uhura.  Bonanno's depiction of Uhura as a confident seasoned veteran who knows how invaluable her lifetime of experiences is is truly exceptional.  We see a woman who has more than earned a quiet retirement but who is not yet ready to go quietly into the night.  The author not only fills out Uhura's back-story but also allows us a peek into how Starfleet Intelligence operated at that time.   <br />But it is the enigmatic character of Zetha who really draws you in and she is the key to making the entire story work.  Through Zetha the reader gets a glimpse inside Romulan culture and we see their society starkly and honestly through her eyes.  Bonanno's writing has the ability to make you feel as if you are experiencing everything right along with the characters.  Yet even as we are drawn to Zetha and into her story, right up until the end you are never able to feel certain, one way or another, about who or what she really is.<br />Uhura's `team' is made up of familiar characters including Dr. Selar, Beverly Crusher and Leonard McCoy who is as cantankerous as ever.  There is also Tuvok who has returned to Starfleet by this time and a young Luitenant named Benjamin Sisko.  Sisko's characterization is perhaps the most surprising, after all we are used to thinking of Sisko as a natural leader, a war heroand the Emissary of the Prophets.  This much younger Ben Sisko hasn't come to that point yet in his life, but there are times you can catch glimpses of the man he will become.<br />Bottom line: An entertaining and blissful reading experience.	2004-01-06
US	52025410	R1FFD31IYJN4IB	0743471180	357396953	Star Trek: Enterprise: Daedalus	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Full of Surprises	What surprised me the most about &quot;Daedalus&quot; was how enjoyable a reading experience it was.  I readily admit that I wasn't expecting much based on the previous Enterprise novels but &quot;Daedalus&quot;, despite its weaknesses, was an interesting story with appealing characters that was solidly executed.  Not great but certainly engaging and entertaining.<br />The title, Daedalus, refers to the ship of that name, an experimental warp capable vessel that exploded on its maiden voyage thirteen years earlier.  Tucker, who had worked on the Daedalus project, finds his memories of that catastrophe coming back to haunt him in more ways than one in this story and it is Commander Tucker who quickly becomes the main character in the novel.  Stern's characterization of Trip is excellent, the personality and voice of the engineer comes through marvelously.<br />While Hoshi and Tucker are the only two main Enterprise characters utilized in &quot;Daedalus&quot; after the first three chapters, and Hoshi plays only a limited role, the other characters are well drawn.  They are sympathetic but strong.  The Denari doctor, a woman named Trant is particularly likable.  However, the apparent villain, General Sadir, is only seen superficially, primarily through hearsay.<br />Just after the midway point the plot of &quot;Daedalus&quot; takes it's first startling twist but it is in the final chapter that Stern guarantees you'll want to read part two, &quot;Daedalus's Children&quot;, by dropping another astonishing, and hopefully unforeseen turn into the story.  How the story is concluded in the second part will ultimately determine just how good this first part was, and hopefully the plot can maintain its momentum and we will have to wait until May 2004 to find out, but based on the story thus far I'm feeling a lot more optimistic than I expected.	2003-12-26
US	52025410	RNQPQ1RNXU4FI	0743457161	616767174	Star Trek: The Next Generation: I.K.S. Gorkon: Honor Bound (Star Trek: Klingon Empire) (Bk. 2)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Invigorating Entertainment	&quot;Honor Bound' follows up immediately on the events of I.K.S. Gorkon, Book One &quot;A Good Day to Die&quot; when Captain Klag of the I.K.S. Gorkon, defeated in honorable combat, agreed to leave the world of San-Tarah in peace.  Ordered to go back on his word by General Talak, Klag instead chooses to make a stand to preserve the integrity of the Empire and he calls on his fellow members of the Order of the Bat'leth to rally to his call.  It is Klingon against Klingon in an epic battle that pits honor against an apparently superior foe.<br />The first 100 pages of &quot;Honor Bound&quot; are almost a prelude as step-by-step DeCandido methodically builds up the tension before the story explodes into action as Talak's fleet and those who have answered Klag's call engage in fierce battle.  Then all hell breaks loose.  The action shifts back and forth between the brutal and extremely graphic scenes of the engagements on the surface of San-Tarah, and the clash of the ships battling it out in the skies above.  Honor Bound is most definitely a tale of warfare.  Good old-fashioned action-adventure-Klingon style.<br />Despite the attention the author has given to the details of describing all the hand-to-hand combat and the deadly dance being performed by the massive ships above, &quot;Honor Bound&quot; still manages to be a story about the characters that are doing all the fighting.  DeCandido is able to expand and advance the reader's knowledge of his familiar characters without overshadowing the other characters that inhabit this particular story.   There may not be a human in the bunch but each character has his or her own unique voice, and a point of view you can understand, even if you cannot agree with it.<br />The entire novel is carefully and skillfully plotted, building to highlight after highlight, with more than one surprise along the way, before finally culminating in a climax that might just have you cheering along with the characters.  But even if you are not inclined to cheer, &quot;Honor Bound&quot; is definitely one invigorating and extremely fun read.	2003-12-09

If you've got doubts, you can put them to rest.  This is an excellent collection of rewarding stories by authors who amply demonstrate that they know the characters they are writing about.<br />One of the pleasures of reading a large collection such as this is that the order you read the stories in doesn't matter, every time you pick the volume up there is something new and different to look forward to.  Some stories will capture your imagination more than others but within the pages of NO LIMITS the reader gets to experience a little bit of everything--comedy, drama, action and adventure.  The various authors effectively use their individual storytelling styles to explore key moments in the characters lives, and every story to some degree just adds to the overall tapestry of New Frontier.  And while my own personal favorites of the collection, \\"Waiting for G'Doh\\", \\"Q'uandary\\", \\"Lefler's Logs\\",  &quot;Performance Appraisal\\", \\"Making a Difference\\", &quot;The Road to Edos&quot;, \\"A Little Getaway\\" and &quot;Out of the Frying Pan&quot;, may not be your own, I have no doubts that anyone reading NO LIMITS should find plenty to satisfy.	2003-12-05

From beginning to end &quot;Unity&quot; is utterly mesmerizing.<br />If it's been some time since you read the previous novels you don't have to worry about feeling lost.  The first thing you'll discover when you open the cover of &quot;Unity&quot; is a complete timeline that recounts the main events that have occurred since the final episode \\"What You Leave Behind\\" right up through the divergent endings of &quot;Rising Son&quot; and &quot;Lesser Evil&quot; when the U.S.S. Defiant is about to return to the station through the wormhole following their exploration of the Gamma Quadrant.  After a brief prologue the story picks up right where it left off and upon returning those onboard the Defiant are immediately confronted with the reality of Bajor under siege by the parasites.<br />Given how complex the ongoing story has grown over through the various relaunch novels I had to admit that I had my doubts about whether or not &quot;Unity&quot; could live up to it's expectations but S.D. Perry delivers the goods.  Her gripping narrative easily transports the reader right smack dab into the middle of the crisis while at the same time she manages to reverentially, and at times even tenderly, address the personal issues confronting the various characters.  With real virtuosity &quot;Unity&quot; manages to be both the perfect ending and a new beginning all at the same time.<br />The three hundred pages that tell this tale fly by in the blink of an eye and there is an incredible amount packed into those pages.  Reading &quot;Unity&quot; left me feeling unreservedly contented and completely satisfied.	2003-11-12
US	52025410	R31G5TTJQXVCI9	0743463757	386633957	Well of Souls	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Hard to get into	To say that \\"Well of Souls\\" is not your conventional Star Trek novel is a bit of an understatement.  It is a book that is bound to provoke a strong reaction, either positive or negative in those that read it.  \\"Well of Souls\\" contains many of the usual elements you would expect to find in a Star Trek novel but many more that you usually don't.<br />First and foremost this novel is about the characters.  They are perhaps the most human cast of characters I can ever remember encountering in any Star Trek book.  They are flawed, and that, in and of itself, is extremely refreshing.  Unfortunately all the soul searching and introspection bogs down the pace of the story and I found myself becoming extremely impatient the more I read.  Every time the plot began to pick up a bit the narrative suddenly changes tempo and reverts to a slow crawl.  The author throws in more than one left curve and there are small bursts of action within the subplot but until the final one hundred or so pages they never last for long enough to build momentum.<br />We didn't get to know learn very much about Rachel Garrett in the Next Generation episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" and I must admit that my initial reaction to the character in \\"Well of Souls\\" made me feel very grateful for that lack of knowledge.  But as the story unfolds you can find much to admire in her character and you might even find yourself empathizing with Garrett and her dysfunctional officers to some degree.  The sheer number of secondary characters is a bit overwhelming at times and they are not all as fully developed as they could have been but some of them really stand out, like the straight talking CMO Jo Stern or the Naxeran tactical officer G'Dok Ghemour.   <br />Bick's prose however is wonderful.  Exquisitely descriptive and at times so graphic you can't help but feel uncomfortable.  This is Ilsa Bick's first full-length novel although her short fiction has been widely acclaimed and her talent shines from every pageof \\"Well of Souls\\".  The point of view of each character comes through clearly and the scene transitions are wonderful. But while the execution of the story is superb on a number of levels it is a difficult story to get involved in initially.  The old saying \\"first impressions are the most important\\" is extremely apt when it comes to \\"Well of Souls\\".  While this novel may not make a particularly good first impression, patience with its eccentricities does bring some rewards in the end.	2003-10-30

A. DeCandido proves with this splendid new novel \\"A Good Day to Die\\" that he understands what it means to be Klingon.  Book one of the new I.K.S. Gorkon series; \\"A Good Day to Die\\" reintroduces the crew of the Chancellor-class I.K.S. Gorkon that fans first met in DeCandido's 2001 novel \\"Diplomatic Implausibility\\".<br />While exploring the previously uncharted Kavrot Sector in the Beta Quadrant the Gorkon discovers an M-Class world rich in resources the Empire desperately needs.  However, instead of the populace of easily subdued primitives they expect to encounter, the crew of the Gorkon finds themselves facing the Children of San-Tarah, a race of warriors whose skill any Klingon can admire.  In fact both groups find much to respect in the other.  Klag and the leader of the San-Tarah, Me-Larr, come to an unusual decision; the fate of the San-Tarah will be decided by five martial contests.  If the Klingons win the majority, the San-Tarah will willingly become subjects of the Empire.  But if the San-Tarah are victorious the Klingons will depart and leave them in peace.<br />This is indeed a tale worthy of song as DeCandido brings the characters and culture of both the Klingons and the San-Tarah to life in a glorious tale that will leave you salivating for book two that will conclude the story.	2003-10-18

This novel has it all; a riveting plot, incredibly vivid and interesting characters, plenty of action and enough continuity to delight even the most persnickety fan.  The story also has broad appeal, tying together events and characters from every aspect of the Star Trek universe: the series, the movies, comics and novels.<br />It takes a master storyteller to turn a thirty-second conversation in the Deep Space Nine episode \\"The Way of the Warrior\\" into a novel with this much scope, imagination and detail.  Keith DeCandido has been delighting Star Trek readers with his writing since he burst onto the scene with \\"Diplomatic Implausibility\\" in 1991, but with The Art of the Impossible he has really outdone himself.  In this novel DeCandido not only succeeds in telling a notable story but he also allows the reader a glimpse inside the hearts and minds of the characters and their cultures.  Divided into three parts The Art of the Impossible tells the story from multiple points of view and takes the reader into the worlds of the Klingons, the Cardassians and even the Romulans of that period.	2003-09-29

It is a very pleasurable and mostly rewarding journey.  Ten original stories are included in this lengthy collection from authors both familiar and new.  Nine of those stories are set during the series, with only the final contribution being set post-finale.  Each regular character has a chance to shine in at least one story, and many of the recurring characters as well.<br />As with any type of story anthology the writing styles vary, but each story has one thing in common--each succeeds in capturing the mood and atmosphere of Deep Space Nine.  Some of the stories look at events set between episodes; others at changes the characters underwent that were never addressed onscreen and still others at unseen events set during specific episodes.  Some stories answer questions others raise new ones.  Just as the variety of beings who populated Deep Space Nine contributed to the gratifying experience of watching the series, the variety of stories in this volume make for a full and rich reading experience.<br />Ultimately, each individual who reads this anthology will form his or her own opinions about each story.   There will be stories you will probably like or dislike based on your own tastes and preferences.  Some may even love them all.  I know that sometime in the future I will want to revisit this collection and it will be interesting to see if my favorites during my first read through this volume, \\"Broken Oaths\\", \\"Foundlings\\", \\"Face Value\\", \\"Ha'mara\\", \\"Three Sides to Every Story\\" and \\"The Orb of Opportunity\\" provide the same level of pleasure when read for a second or third time.  But that is ultimately what I enjoy most about reading a great anthology--and I believe &quot;Prophecy and Change&quot; fits the description--it stays on the shelf for a period of timebut eventually you find yourself wanting to revisit old favorites.  Deep Space Nine fans definitely won't want to miss this collection.	2003-09-18

Novels don't get much better than this, any type of novel.  \\"Serpents Among the Ruins\\" by David R. George III has every element that makes for an exceptional reading experience. An original and imaginative plot, phenomenal characters, and a distinctive style that the author is able to sustain from the beginning to the end.<br />The year is 2311 and the event is the mysterious and infamous Tomed Incident.  The Federation and the Romulan Star Empire are on a countdown to war.  Neither side has any doubt that war will come. Step by step, inch-by-inch, through a series of events large and small the two powers move ever closer to the seemingly inevitable conflict.   The only questions there seem to be are what will be the spark that ignites the hostilities, and who will the Klingons side with.<br />After eighteen years in command of Starfleet's flagship, the Enterprise-B, Captain John Harriman is a seasoned and experienced leader, a man with more than his share of experience with the Romulans.  Many things have transpired through the years to bring Harriman to this point in his career and this point in history.  And it will take every resource at his disposal and a bit of luck too; to make sure that the Federation survives.<br />Dramatic and suspenseful are the first words that spring to mind as I try to describe my thoughts about this spectacular novel.  At the same time \\"Serpents Among the Ruins\\" manages to be a contemplative and poignant story as well.  A story driven by the characters that are in turn driven by the events they find themselves caught up in.<br />This novel builds slowly, allowing the reader to get to know the principal characters: their motivations, their nature, their flaws and strengths, and their hopes and dreams.  It allows you to see the events from the perspective of Romulans and Klingons as well as citizens of the Federation.  The first one hundred pages or so sets the stage with narrative so richly detailed that the events seem entirely real.You feel as if you are watching these momentous, albeit fictitious, events unfold before your eyes.<br />The author, David R. George III, exhibits extraordinary craftsmanship as he carefully takes the reader through the brilliantly plotted events.  He draws for the reader the portrait of a man, John Harriman, who has been born and breed to serve the Federation.  An open and deceptively casual man who projects a confidence he does not always feel but who is totally secure with himself and his convictions.  A man with the weight of the Quadrant on his shoulders, who before the story is done you can't help but both like and admire.<br />The other characters who populate \\"Serpents Among the Ruins\\" are just as striking, each in their own way.  No matter what each readers preconceived notions are of the who, what, where and how of the Tomed Incident that \\"Serpents Among the Ruins\\" so powerfully and impressively illuminates, nothing in your imagination could compare to this gripping and shocking tale.	2003-09-04

An `A' story set board the Stargazer involving the twin sisters Gerda and Idun Asmund, the ships helm and navigation officers, and a `B' story involving the Stargazer's Pandrilite weapons officer Vigo.  After dropping Vigo off at a research outpost on Wayland Prime, where he is to observe tests on a new type of phaser emitter, Stargazer has been sent to investigate an anomaly that has recently appeared in an area of space claimed by the Balduk, an extremely obnoxious race that is fiercely protective of their territory.  <br />Without warning a transporter beam deposits a mysterious visitor onboard the Stargazer, a woman who appears to be in every way an exact duplicate of the Asmund twins.

Meanwhile, on Wayland Prime, Vigo finds himself in the middle of a very nasty situation when a group of terrorists take over the facility, aided by one of his oldest friends. <br />Some readers of this series will probably find Three satisfactory and willing overlook the total predictability of the story.

As a race the Balduk are at times so preposterous that they are almost comical but the suspense of whether or not Wutor would achieve his goals was one element that kept the story interesting.  <br />The plot moves quickly through the author's use of short scenes.  The narrative is kept very simple, almost minimal.  There are several amusing sly little references that have a little innocent fun at the expense of Picard and his future experiences on the Enterprise-D that many fans are sure to appreciate.  <br />Picard himself plays only a minor roll in the overall story; the focus is much more on his crew and their reactions to their `visitor'.  <br />Regrettably the positive elements of Three are unable to save it.  A quarter of the way in it is glaringly obvious exactly how both plot lines will unfold.  You keep hoping you're wrong and something else will happen but the story remains mostly unimaginative.

Martin is an incredible story in so many different ways.  Whatever way you add it up it still comes out the same way-this is one great novel.  The first of the much-touted Lost Era novels, this book does more than live up to its promise, it surpasses it.<br />The Sundered is an amazing and compelling book, one that should have great appeal, on a number of levels for a wide variety of readers. Utilizing both familiar and unique characters, the authors paint a picture with their prose of three distinct societies:  the Federation of that era, the Tholian Assembly and the Neyel Hegemony.  The authors take the time to introduce the characters.  Instead of rushing the plot, they patiently allow the characters to become `real'.<br />Martin and Mangels depiction of the Excelsior crew is of a group of individuals who have developed deep and lasting relationships over a long period.  There is a real comfort level in the way they interact.  The Tholian society portrayed in The Sundered may not meet every reader's preconceived notions of that alien species, but I thought the author's depiction of the Tholians was incredible.  Building on what little is known about the physical appearance of the non-humanoid Tholians, Martin and Mangels skillfully illuminate an intricate and fascinating species and provide our first real look at their unique civilization.  The Tholian characters are as fully realized as any of the other characters in this story.<br />The plot makes use of the classic story within a story framework.  As the scenes shift from the current events to the past, we are gradually able to understand how the Neyel became who they are.  How all they had gone through shaped their beliefs and how those beliefs shaped their actions.  They went from being creepy to sympathetic by the end and it would be wonderful to find out some day if their hopes and dreams come true.<br />One of the great things about The Sundered was how the story would often raise questions in your mind, you would begin to wonder about something and then within a chapter or two all was made clear.  It was actually more satisfying than if it had all been laid out to begin with.  Additionally, the way the authors were able to cleverly explain previous inconsistencies while at the same time adhering to established continuity was very impressive.<br />Whatever way you look at it, Star Trek novels don't get much better than The Sundered.  It is a true science fiction tale that amply demonstrates that the Star Trek universe is still a wonderful place to explore the human condition.	2003-07-24

As magnificent as the first book of The Left Hand of Destiny is the second book is even better.<br />The second book follows immediately upon the events of book one as the scene shifts from Qo'nos and those left standing attempt to regroup and plan a counter attack.  Joined by Ezri Dax for the second half of the story, the author's cleverly allow the characters themselves to tell most of the rest of the story.  And what a story it is!  I do not want to spoil the impact of the astonishing events that unfold as this epic races towards its final and resonant confrontation but I would recommend that you make sure you will be uninterrupted during the final chapters.	2003-05-02

It is not often that a book or movie lives up to its hype, but the two-part epic, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine-The Left Hand of Destiny certainly does.  J.G. Hertzler and Jeffrey Lang have produced a magnificent and mesmerizing heroic sage that immerses the reader in a timeless tale of revenge and obsession Klingon style.  Mystic visions, destruction, mayhem, sacrifice, loyalty, honor and, of course, battles. Valiant but bloody battles filled with daring deeds and heart pounding action.  Star Trek novels don't get much more satisfying or true to type than The Left Hand of Destiny--these are most definitely Klingons.<br />Just days after the events of Deep Space Nine's final episode \\"What You Leave Behind\\", General Martok, now Chancellor, has returned to the Klingon homeworld to assume the leadership of the Klingon council, with Worf, newly appointed Federation ambassador, at his side. Uncomfortable with his new role, Martok is unsure of his welcome among the old established families that have long ruled the Empire.  But no stretch of the imagination could prepare Martok, or the reader, for the events that unfold upon his arrival.<br />Book one sets events in motion in spectacular fashion when, with one stroke, the mighty Klingon Empire is brought to its knees by Morjod, Martok's bastard son.  But Morjod and his army of Hur'q (yep the Hur'q) are simply pawns in a dangerous game being played by Martok's former lover, the deranged and deadly Gothmara.  The saying `hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' is a bit of an understatement when applied to a Klingon.<br />Pursued by Morjod and his followers, Martok and all those loyal to him are mercilessly hunted as the desperately seek answers to their numerous unanswered questions.  Attempting to use Martok's own loyalties against him, Morjod's forces imprison Sirella, using her as bait to lure Martok to his own doom.   The climactic rescue of Martok and Sirella from their own execution is, in itself, a deed worth of song. <br />One of the best attributes of The Left Hand of Destiny is the large and diverse cast of characters.  Both the heroes and villains are skillfully and superbly portrayed.  Surprisingly one of the most interesting characters isn't even Klingon, but rather a Ferengi named Pharh, a refuse excavator who is drawn, at first reluctantly, into the fray.  You can't help but admire this plucky little guy. <br />Drawing on the Klingon mythos established in the various series and novels J.G. Hertzler and Jeffrey Lang masterfully manage to combine humor and action as they submerge the reader in Klingon culture.  The tension filled plot builds continuously, the raw power and emotion of the prose literally leaps off the page.  From the First City, to the Ketha lowlands, to the frozen wastes of Boreth, the attention to the small details that can make or break a story are obvious.  Some of the images employed are clearly drawn from classic sources but they are used so perfectly in the story that it is easy to overlook and forgive.<br />There are many moments in this tale that will linger in your mind long after you finish reading it.  Even those who are not particularly Klingon fans should be able to appreciate the vividness of the writing style.  Those that are strong Klingon fans will think they have died and gone to Sto-Vo-Kor.  Qapla'!	2003-05-02

Dillard has written an original Star Trek novel.  Her work the last few years has primarily been episode and movie novelizations, most recently the novelization of Nemesis.  With the Enterprise novel Surak's Soul, she has fashioned a pleasant enough story but regrettably, while the novel is very readable it is not particularly original, complex or lengthy.   <br />When the Enterprise responds to a distress signal they find a civilization on the brink of extinction, the entire population dead or dying from a mysterious illness.  T'Pol, forced to kill the last remaining survivor in order to save Hoshi, undergoes an identity crisis.  She cannot help fearing that her time on board the Enterprise is leading her to forsake the teachings of Surak and his philosophy of non-violence.  <br />While the Enterprise remains to investigate the mysterious disease, they learn more about the planets inhabitants, the Oani, a society whose reverence for life has sadly led to their own demise.  Offered assistance by a mysterious alien entity, an energy being they call the Wanderer, the Enterprise and its crew soon begin to exhibit the same symptoms as the Oanis.  Did they bring the illness back on board despite their precautions, or is there a more sinister plan afoot?<br />Surak's Soul moves at a good pace and I really enjoyed Ms. Dillard's characterization and attention to the small details.  Unfortunately that is not enough to overcome the periods of tedium the story generates.  Despite the dire circumstances the crew finds themselves in the story fails to generate a sense of urgency or real danger.<br />T'Pol's philosophical soul searching, the issue of when violence is or is not justified, is the major theme of the novel.  Unfortunately, in the case of Surak's Soul, ethical contemplation is not enough to sustain the story on its own.	2003-03-07

Favorite characters off on an important mission.  Set during the original five year mission the story is, unfortunately, only mildly interesting.  The book does, however, succeed in catching the mood of the series and the characterizations of the main characters is spot on.<br />When the Enterprise is sent to the planet Nador to facilitate the Nadorians first election things begin to go wrong almost immediately.  The Nadorians will be voting on whether or not to join the Federation, and there are those who will stop at nothing to prevent that from happening.  Then the planet's monarch's, their Serene Highnesses Abon and Delor, become a target for the opposition, who seem to be able to operate with impunity.<br />It turns out that Kirk's nephew Peter (\\"Operation Annihilate!\\") has been living on the planet. Between assassination attempts on the princes, annoying Nadorian bureaucrats, and the kidnapping of Peter Kirk, you would think it should all be pretty exciting.  Regrettably it isn't.  Gemini has its moments but many of the scenes that should have been the most stimulating fall flat.<br />The best part of the story is the interaction between Kirk, Spock and McCoy.  The playful byplay and camaraderie shines through the setting.  Several lower deck characters play an enjoyable roll too, such as Yeoman Barrows who befriends the princes consort, Lady Pataal.  Chekov, Sulu, Uhura are barely utilized but Scotty gets a few moments.<br />The characters original to the story, however, just don't work very well.  The princes, conjoined twin brothers whose well being is a major part of the storyline, failed to capture my interest or sympathy.  A crying consort hovering in the background didn't help much either.  The local bureaucrats are at least unlikable.  Two characters I did enjoy though were the Federation representative, Commissioner Sylvan Roget and his wife Janine.<br />Those longing for an original seriesadventure should be satisfied with Gemini but those looking for something more than run of the mill might want to try something else.	2003-02-20

Author Keith R.A. DeCandido has crafted a well written and compelling story in the new hardcover novel Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Destruction of Illusions.  Penning the first novel in a series can be difficult but Mr. DeCandido has risen magnificently to the challenge presenting for the readers enjoyment a tale that has action, adventure, humor and spot on characterizations.<br />Destruction of Illusions is a prequel, taking the reader through the story of how Beka Valentine and the crew of the Eureka Maru and Tyr Anasazi and his band of mercenaries came to find themselves part of the bold salvage operation of the Andromeda Ascendant in \\"Under the Night\\", Andromeda's pilot episode.  Fittingly Destruction of Illusions begins and ends with the recovery of the Andromeda Ascendant.<br />As the reader follows the crew of the Maru through the events and adventures that lead them to Dylan, the hardships and realities of their life eking out a living in the former Commonwealth are vividly presented.  We also get to learn what drove Tyr to do what he has done in his pursuit of restoring the Kodiak Pride to glory.  Along the way there is a daring breakout, a liberal sprinkling of Nietzschean politics, a dangerous and dramatic museum heist, the appearance of several familiar faces and most importantly great character development.  Oh yes, and Dylan and Roomie are in it as well.<br />DeCandido adroitly fleshes out the back-stories established onscreen for the characters in a tight well-paced plot.  In the style of the show each chapter begins with a pertinent quotation.  Since he has only been mentioned twice in the series, one character we finally get learn more about is Vexpag, Trance's forerunner on the Maru.   He even gains a given name in the novel.  But the character that I found myself seeing in a new light was Rev Bem.  His importance to Beka and his unique personality shines through better in the pages of Destruction of Illusions that it has onscreen.  Each and every character and event in Destruction of Illusions is keenly and skillfully portrayed allowing the reader to loss themselves in the story right up until you turn the last page.	2003-02-13

(Enterprise)	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Give this one a pass	The plot's been done to death, and much more effectively: A Starfleet vessel, in this case the Enterprise NX-01, caught up in a war between two species. This time around it is the Sarkassians and the Ta'alaat. Mind control, mysterious alien technology beyond the crew's comprehension and a crewmember, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed, racked with guilt. Yawn. <br />The text of the book makes several references to the Enterprise being approximately a year into its mission, which would place the story in 2152. Consequently I found it very trying to have a large bold chapter heading glaring at me every few minutes, with a date that places the events well before Enterprise even left earth. <br />Even if you can get past the cookie-cutter plot and conspicuous errors, it's hard to care what happens in What Price Honor?. The writing is stiff and flat. It is impossible to feel any empathy for the downtrodden Ta'alaat as you learn next to nothing about them. The aggressors, the Sarkassians, are easy to dislike, but that is based on the behavior of one particularly obnoxious ambassador. The whole story feels incomplete somehow, as if it was all written in a big rush without the author really thinking about it.	2002-11-14

This is the first title in a planned trilogy but it not only fails to hold the readers interest, it's down right ludicrous in many ways.<br />Set on Bajor after the Dominion War where Kirk and Picard are taking a joint vacation planning to explore an archeology site they find themselves caught up in a web of deception that has escalated to murder.  Through flashbacks Kirk remembers a mission<BR>early in his career as captain of the Enterprise.  The flashbacks are meant to set up the subsequent books but long before the end of this novel I found myself losing interest in the long-winded narrative.<br />If you're a die-hard fan and will read this title anyway, wait for the paperback.

I may run out of adjectives trying to describe this suspenseful mystery without spoiling it.<br />At the heart of this story is one of trek's most beloved characters, Data.  As the personnel of the Enterprise-E struggle to unravel the threads that hold the key to the mystery they uncover the hidden history of artificial intelligence.  Data is poignantly forced to confront his past, his present and his future.  As the story unfolds page by page the reader is drawn into a skillfully woven plot that exhibits an almost Machiavellian flair.<br />Thanks to a fantastic story premise and the dexterous touch of author Jeffrey Lang, &quot;Immortal Coil&quot; is the type of book that leaves you quenched when you close the cover for the final time.  As if you've just finished a large drink after being thirsty for a very long time.  Lang manages to perceptively capture the characters, especially Data, whom he characterizes with an acuteness that makes him tangible.  This is a character we know and love, but whom we've never seen or thought of in this way before.<br />&quot;Immortal Coil&quot; is a book to relish.  Charming, fascinating, complex, and masterful.  A book that leaves you savoring the story long after you finish reading it.	2002-02-06

The whole idea behind the Gateways series was that at the end of each book the commander stepped through the Gateway.

But those conclusions were for the most part extremely stupid and played no role in the overall resolution of the series.  The final story in the book, the TNG offering does conclude and resolve the crisis presented to the galaxy by the activation of the Gateways.

Seemingly just along for the ride.  &quot;No Man's Land&quot; certainly did not fall flat.  It's an enjoyable, if  not outstanding read.  But it as far as placing it among the other Gateways books it does feel as if it's just along for the ride.  Perhaps because the plot is so far removed from the main story line of the series.  Author Christie Golden always captures the Voyager crew members very well.  Her characterizations in &quot;No Man's Land&quot; are one of the books highlights.  With a deft touch she brings the crew and factious aliens to life, leaving you despising some while admiring others.<br />Set during the sixth season of Voyager, the crew is beginning to feel like they will actually be getting home someday.  The recent contact with Starfleet has raised hopes and spirits.  But directly in their path lies an extremely hazardous region of space that the crew dubs 'No Man's Land'.  After deciding that traveling around the region is not an option, Janeway concludes that they could all benefit from a little R &amp; R on a nearby uninhabited class-M planet before the ship undertakes this<BR>latest challenge.<br />Shore leave is cut short when a mysterious portal opens on the planet depositing one very lost and confused alien canine.  Investigation of the portal provides no answers and the crew seems to have acquired a grateful mascot when suddenly large portals begin to open all around Voyager in the surrounding space.  Voyager soon finds itself overwhelmed and outnumbered by ships from all over the galaxy that have suddenly found themselves displaced.  62 vessels, representing 48 different<BR>races, most previously unknown, all lost along with Voyager in the Delta Quadrant.<br />By now the crew has realized that these portals are some kind of Gateways.  Gateways which seem to have closed, at least for the moment.  Janeway decides to extend Voyager's companionship, protection and assistance to any of the vessels that wish to accompany them on their travels.  Hoping that by working together they can solve the mystery of the Gateways, share resources and all somehow arrive home.   A number of the ships, representing very diverse species decide to take Janeway up on her offer.  Some of these species are obviously peaceful.  Others arrogant or hostile.<br />As this ragtag fleet of disparate ships sets out they have no way of knowing what dangers lie ahead as they attempt to traverse 'No Man's Land'.  Or if they can truly trust each other.  One thing after another goes wrong with the situation quickly becoming even more tense and desperate.  The Gateways keep reappearing and disappearing.  Each contact draining the ships of power.  Just as it seems that they may all be forced to abandon their vessels Janeway makes the decision to step through a Gateway and try to discover if the answer to finding a way home can be found in what lays beyond. <br />&quot;No Man's Land&quot; is a very short, light and fast read.  The plot moves quickly.  While there is nothing particularly outstanding about the story it is filled with interesting characters and has nice touches of humor.  The story never really develops a sense of urgency, although it does present a number of small mysteries and subplots.	2001-10-10

Peter David's unique little corner of the Star Trek universe takes another giant leap forward with this story.  As always Mr. David continues to weave an ever expanding colorful tapestry of story lines involving unique multidimensional characters.  With &quot;Cold Wars&quot; he manages to do so while telling a dramatic, wild and woolly story that is filled with the usual homage's to trek and touches of offbeat humor that help to distinguish New Frontier.<br />Set after the events of &quot;Restoration&quot;, which left diehard New Frontier fans with numerous questions to debate, I am happy to tell you that &quot;Cold Wars&quot; does indeed answer many of those questions.<br />With the promotion of Shelby to Captain, and the return of Calhoun, there are now two Federation starships assigned to patrol Sector 221-G. Otherwise known as the former Thallonian Empire.  The newly launched Galaxy class USS Excalibur, and the USS Trident.  Both ships are assigned to investigate any Gateway activity in their sector.<br />The Aeron and Markanians used to live on the same planet.  Bitter enemies, they had brought their world to the brink of destruction with their attempts to annihilate each other.   Their home world, Sinqay, was located in Thallonian space.  Fed up with their attempts to destroy each other, the Thallonian Empire relocated the two cultures to different planets light years from each other 100 years ago.  Neither race having space flight capabilities had enabled both cultures to grow and prosper on their separate worlds.  But the reawakening of the Gateways has allowed the age old conflict to erupt anew.<br />Shelby sets out to tackle the Markanians while the Excalibur tries to reason with the Aeron.  Their mission is two fold.  To attempt to mediate a peace between the two ancient enemies and gain possession of the Gateway's they have at their disposal.  But the Aeron and Markanians are just pawns in a much larger, extremely dangerousgame.  Things do not go smoothly and both Calhoun and Shelby resort to some rather high handed and unorthodox methods in their attempts to bring the two peoples<BR>to a peaceful resolution of their differences.<br />While the basic plot formula is an overused one; 'two warring nations must be brought to their senses'.  In the hands of Peter David the story is definitely not the usual.  I enjoyed &quot;Cold Wars&quot; immensely on many different levels.  As with most New Frontier novels you can expect the unexpected and that is one of the charms of this book.  The story is absorbing with well crafted characters.  It moves quickly with numerous changes of scene as the action smoothly shifts from planet to planet and<BR>ship to ship.<br />The usual tangled web of tension filled relationships among the crew is toned down somewhat in &quot;Cold Wars&quot;.  Many of the characters such as McHenry and Lefler are used more as background players as the new characters and new relationships are established.  Now his wife and his equal as a Captain their is of course a major change in the relationship between Shelby and Mackenzie Calhoun.  The verbal sparing that characterized their relationship in the past is for the time being at least subdued.<br />There is something particularly enjoyable about reading a novel that not only compels you to keep turning the pages, but manages to tickle your funny bone as well.  Shortly after the half way point in the book I found myself putting it down deliberately so that I could make it last as long as possible.  &quot;Cold Wars&quot; was indeed a very satisfactory story.	2001-10-10

The story is in the beginning quite chaotic, jumping from scene to scene to set things up, but it soon settles into an elaborate and engrossing plot that continues to build as the pages turn. &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; is the TNG installment in this series. As the story opens several things are all happening simultaneously. Gateways across the galaxy are turned on and various races, both familiar and unknown, begin to take advantage of the ability for instant transportation that they provide. Until they were activated the existence of these Gateways was unknown. It soon becomes apparent that stepping through the Gateways either intentionally or accidentally can lead to ramifications that no one could possibly foresee or guard against. Consequently Captain Picard and Counselor Troi have been summoned posthaste to Earth to attend an emergency conference. The ancient Iconians have returned. Or have they? Each of the major powers in the Alpha Quadrant has been approached by representatives of a race claiming to be the descendants of the legendary Iconians. They are the ones who have reactivated the Gateways and are offering the secret to controlling the technology to the highest bidder. War weary and still recovering from the Dominion war, Starfleet is suspicious of the mysterious aliens but at the same time must prevent the technology from falling into the hands of any potential aggressors. Admiral Ross calls upon Picard to head up a seemingly impossible mission. The first objective is for himself, Picard and Troi, to approach key Alpha Quadrant races and enlist their support in forming a task force of representative races to approach the Iconians as a united group. Some races decline to join with the Federation in this endeavor, being either unwilling or unable to cooperate. But others decide to join in, if for no other reason than to make sure that whatever is learned of the technology is shared. The second objective is for this convoy of ships to approach the Iconians and try to determine if they can either prove or reasonably be supposed to be who they claim to be. Harder still will be trying to persuade them to deactivate the Gateways while discussions about the technology are taking place. Comprised of Romulans, Klingons, Deltans, Ferengi, Gorn, and others, the Enterprise and this unlikely fleet prepares to confront the Iconians and attempt to learn just who and what is behind the riddle of the Gateways. Picard struggles to control his allies and their sometimes conflicting interests as elsewhere chaos is reigning across the quadrant and beyond. It does not take long for things to get out of hand and a fierce and deadly battle ensues. A battle that seems to provoke yet more questions, but whose outcome forces the Iconians to talk and to finally supply some answers to at least a portion of the riddle. In the end some of pieces of the puzzle are in place, but important ones are still missing as conditions across the galaxy are becoming more and more desperate. Just like the other commanders before him, Picard is forced to step through the Gateway in hopes that the answers they need can be found in what lays beyond. &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; finally sees this series coming into focus. And certainly with this novel the series shifts into high gear. This fast paced story is a bit hard to follow at first. There are so many characters to be established and scenes unfolding as the author jumps from situation to situation setting up the plot that I found myself getting a bit frustrated at times trying to keep it all straight. Additionally I usually I enjoy a novel with lots of various Trek references to episodes and previous novels, and &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; certainly has those in abundance, as well numerous cameos of characters from other series. But it's a bit forced at times, and sometimes more of a detriment to the flow of the story than an enhancement to the plot. Despite it's flaws &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; was the best in the series so far. An enjoyable and interesting story that certainly holds your interest. The plotting and events moves quickly and if you enjoy long descriptive battle sequences you are in plenty of action. Overall I would call &quot;Doors into Chaos&quot; a good read. Not great but certainly worth the time, especially if you plan on reading the remaining Gateways novels.	2001-08-28

Written by Diane Carey this is the Challenger installment in the series.  If you are not familiar with the Challenger crew from the New Earth book &quot;Challenger&quot; you definitely want to read that first and become familiar with the characters or it would be very difficult to enjoy &quot;Chainmail&quot;.  &quot;Chainmail&quot; includes no familiar Star Trek characters.  The story is populated with people entirely created from the imagination of the author.<br />Nick Keller and crew are the lone Starfleet presence in the recently settled Belle Terre sector.  A very different type of crew on a very unique vessel.  So it seems appropriate that Keller and company find themselves slap dab in the middle of a really weird situation.  What are they to do with a ship full of animated corpses that seems bound and determined to destroy them, and what is it doing in their little corner of space anyway?   It's a mystery all right.<br />This is the type of novel a reader either likes or loathes.  A story you really have to pay attention to.  Definitely not a light read. I enjoyed the plot immensely and the characters.  But at the same time I found the writing style to be a bit too descriptive, very typical Diane Carey.  The story is filled with confusion at times, and then suddenly there is a startling moment of clarity. &quot;Chainmail&quot; is certainly different that's for sure. So if you feel in the mood for something different, a mystery/adventure with a true Science Fiction touch and unique characters give it a try. If you're looking for a Star Trek novel of the kind you are typically used to then I would pass on &quot;Chainmail&quot;.	2001-08-14

The same virus that decimated the Kalandan colony that once inhabited the engineered planetoid.  Stranded on the planet until a cure is found, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Sulu decide to put the time to good use and explore the base of what was obviously a technologically advanced society.<br />Meanwhile the huge power surge given off by the planet when its defenses were activated has attracted the attention of both a Klingon Captain spoiling for a fight and a scout ship from a previously unknown alien race, the Petraw.  The Petraw are a race that seemingly attain their technology by tricking others out of theirs.  They are able to intercept and decode all messages that they intercept and gain the knowledge they need to plan a strategy that allows them to obtain covertly any technology and information they think will be useful to their race.  In this case, the detection by the Petraw's ships sensors of the power surge leads then to intercept the messages sent by Kirk to Starfleet command and his report of the advanced and powerful technology they have stumbled upon.<br />Sufficiently intrigued by the possible opportunities the alien planetoid might hold, the Petraw leader Tasm plans her teams tactics and decides the best way to obtain access to the technology on the planet is to impersonate the decedents of the Kalandans and claim the base and technology herself.  To this end the Petraw surgically alter themselves to appear as much like the Kalandans as possible.  They successfully synthesis a cure for the virus to offer to the Enterprise crew and time their arrival at the planet to aid the Enterprise which has come under attack from the Klingon ship.<br />Kirk is skeptical of Tasm's claims but decides to cooperate to a point with the 'Kalandans'.  Under orders to learn all he can about the interstellar transporter, this allows the Enterprise crew to continue to investigate the alien technology but also enables the Petraw to realize that within the base lies a Gateway that will bring unimaginable power to whomever learns its secrets.  A technology they are as determined to obtain as Kirk is resolved to keep out of anyone else's hands.  Working together the two crews are able to reactive the portal which brings matters to a climax.  The story ends in a cliffhanger of sorts as the Petraw's plans suddenly go awry.<br />&quot;One Small Step&quot; was a disappoinment to me.  I had two main problems with the book. The first and most important to me were the characterizations of established characters. I did not like the way the author portrayed the TOS crew. This is highly subjective I know, everyone who reads the books envisions the characters their own way. But for me Susan Wright just didn't acurately portray the TOS characters. It was if she didn't really know the characters she was writing.  I did however like the Petraw crew. I thought the race was very interesting indeed and those characters pretty well done.<br />The other major problem I had with the story was that it was downright tedious at times. I got tired of reading about Spock or Scotty or one of the Petraw tracing filaments etc. I was hoping for a little more action.  The plot was very slow.  Every time the story  began to pick up it seemed to suddenly drop off again.  Perhaps I've  been spoilt by the quality of other recent Star Trek novels but &quot;One Small Step&quot; is a book I would call mediocre at best.	2001-07-31

History has been rewritten numerous times in the Star Trek universe, but never as brilliantly as in the incredible new novel from Greg Cox, &quot;The Eugenics Wars:  The Rise and Fall of Kahn Noonien Singh-Volume I&quot;.  Any of fan of Star Trek should be thoroughly entertained by this unbelievably clever retelling of Earth's modern history.  I enjoyed it because it was ingenious, thrilling, sublime, arresting, hysterical at times, and the writing so vivid that while reading I felt like I was watching a prequel to &quot;Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Kahn&quot;.   The characterizations were right on the money and the plot more intricate and compelling than many movies.  If you are looking for a great book to read you need look no further than &quot;The Eugenics Wars&quot;<br />Resplendently peppered with references to modern pop culture, history and numerous Star Trek episodes and movies, the author has managed to seamlessly include a veritable who's who of late 20th century history and Star Trek into the plot of the novel in such a believable way that as you read you almost find yourself nodding and saying &quot;ah, that's how or why that happened&quot;.  Gary Seven, another classic TOS character, along with his sidekick Roberta Lincoln and the mysterious Isis play pivotal roles in young Kahn's life.  Indeed their own story intertwines with Kahn's, as apparently much of the historical records of that time were apparently compiled by agent 194 himself.  A plot contrivance so well done on the part of author Greg Cox that I could not help but think it is the perfect way to tell Kahn's story.	2001-07-01

If you did this book is a must read.  After finishing it I felt as if I had been allowed a glimpse into the mind of a killing machine.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br />&quot;Abyss&quot; sees Julian Bashir being asked by Section 31 to stop one of their own.  This agent, Dr. Ethan Locken, is genetically enhanced and they fear he is out to set himself up as a new Khan with an army of Jem'Hadar to back him.  But Bashir soon learns it is not as simple as that.<br />While not long, the book was well paced and the characterizations subtle.  Flashs of humor help to keep the story from getting too bogged down in philosophical debate about right and wrong and who gets to decide exactly what that is.<br />A thorougly satisfying and enjoyable read.	2001-06-27

I thought the story was very weak.  The other Section 31 novels drew me right in and were very compelling, \\"Shadow\\" however did not.<br />Someone is trying to kill Seven....  That made me the plot very uninteresting.  Add in the subplot of Voyager trying to assist an alien vessel and you get two week storylines that never really work.<br />The characterizations weren't particularly well done either.  I can't think of a single reason to recommend this book to any reader, star trek fan or not.	2001-06-11

It was exciting, compelling, terrifying and touching.  A meaty story I could really sink my teeth into.  Well paced with excellent characterization &quot;Rogue&quot; is full of twists and turns.  From the moment I finished the prologue I was hooked.<br />Avid fans should enjoy the numerous references to trek episodes and novels.  Even if you are not much of a Star Trek fan if you love a good adventure that also forces you to think I feel sure you will enjoy &quot;Rogue&quot;.	2001-06-09

What truly makes these &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; volumes so enjoyable is that the stories are all written by fans.  Not professional writers but just people who enjoy the show and have expressed their appreciation for it by letting their imaginations soar.  They pay tribute to a cultural epic they enjoy through the written word.  <br />Two stories that I know I will be revisiting were the light and funny TOS piece &quot;A Little More Action&quot; and &quot;Tears for Eternity&quot;, also a TOS story.  But the one story moved me enough to be glad I bought this book.  &quot;Isolation Ward 4&quot;.  If you enjoy trek and short stories you should appreciate the stories in &quot;Strange New Worlds IV&quot;.	2001-06-09

But that was the case with &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot;.  I found it to be a weak story, the characters uninteresting and/or annoying, and plain and simply totally boring.  This is the first time I have tried this author, and I won't be in a hurry to try her again if this book is anything to go by.  If you want to read a new trek adventure try something else.  No adventure to be found here.	2001-02-11

DeCandido has really captured Star Trek in his first full length trek novel.  If you are a fan of the Klingons, this book is a must read.  Skillfully woven into the story are numerous Klingon characters from various episodes of both TNG and DS9.  A delightful story of Worf's first assignment as a Federation Ambassador.<br />To me trek novels fall into three catagories.  There's the we've got to save this world, the federation or the galaxy type of story.  The character study stories.  And those stories that are truly unique.  Diplomatic Implausibity falls into the last catagory.  And as a bonus, you'll learn a lot of Klingon words and phrases.  I can't see this book disappointing any trek fan.	2001-02-04

Set before the crossover episodes on the series, it's the story of the struggle for power within the Alliance.  The story opens with Obsidian Order operative Annika Hanson on assignment to assassinate Duras.  Let the political intrige, corruption and betrayal begin!<br />The story grabs you from the start and holds you enthralled.  The characters are not just the ones you would expect to see in the Mirror Universe, such as Intendent Kira, Regent Worf and Sisko.  Characters from TNG and VOY populate the story as well.  Bottom line-fun for any trek fan!	2001-01-05

I found &quot;Wagon Train to the Stars&quot; the 1st book in the New Earth 6 book series to be almost totally non-interesting.  While the story did have  2 or 3 good moments, including a very exciting and unique battle, overall  it just didn't catch my interest.<br />I was looking forward to a grand  sweeping adventure featuring TOS entire crew, plus hopefully some  interesting characters among the colonists.  What I feel I got was a big  isn't Kirk the greatest saga.  Don't get me wrong, I like Capt. Kirk as  much as the next fan.  But come on. Almost 2/3's of the text is Kirk  talking to himself about how heroic he is forced to be.  The other crew  members are underutilized.  In fact they are barely used at all.  Chekov  gets a good storyline for once, but it is much too brief and one of the  books few highlights.<br />We are introduced to a few colonists in a cursory  way.  There are a couple of potentially interesting characters but they  aren't used well. Too bad to.  It had the makings of a grand adventure.  I  would pass on this one if I were you.  I usually enjoy Diane Carey's Trek  novels but this one sadly disappionts.	2000-06-03
