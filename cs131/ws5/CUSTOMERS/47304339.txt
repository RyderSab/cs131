If one has an interest in geology and geography, this journal may be even more engaging as he meticulously describes these subjects throughout his report.<br />The journal describes many important historical first-hand experiences of the times such as the meeting of numerous returning emigrants, the cholera epidemic, abandoned wagons, dead oxen and a plethora of belongings simply dumped along the way, the many graves along the trail and overall activity along the Emigrant Trail.<br />His report and conscience on Brigham Young and the Mormons is praiseworthy and commendable as he received much needed assistance from them while pursuing his surveying responsibilities.<br />Overall a worthy journal with many pages of beautiful drawings.

I read the first edition twenty years ago before leaving for the same location she had been to in the late 1950's of the Peruvian Amazon.  This third edition is also first class.<br />After putting up with remote jungle river travel, wading through swamps knee deep, fighting off persistent insects, confronting the hot, humid climate and accommodations of isolated tropical living, plus other dangers and hazards of the rainforest too numerous to mention, she was snubbed by major pharmaceutical companies for the plant cures she discovered from local natives.<br />She had found plants that cured arthritis, eye diseases, diabetes, forms of cancer and plants that enhanced healing.  Along with plants used as contraceptives, she also located ones which increased fertility and some that assisted in childbirth. Plants for infections, intestinal parasites, tooth and gum disorders, etc. are a few more to mention.  The list goes on.<br />An extraordinary woman whose sole purpose in life was to benefit the well-being of humanity but unfortunately had it fall upon deaf ears.	2005-07-29

Originally established as a stage, freight and mail route to Denver, the trail soon turned into a migratory path for westward emigrants headed north along the Colorado front range and then into Wyoming.  The authors give an encapsulated history of each stage stop along the way with resulting events of the times.  Indian hostilities and depredations played a major role on the Overland Trail.<br />There are wonderful renditions of the authors growing up in the homesteaded area where the Overland Trail crossed their ancestors' land at Sulphur Springs, Wyoming.

Many people ideate Coronado as a bloodthirsty, overpowering man who unwontedly killed every Native American in his path for riches.  Not so according to the unbiased research and scrutiny this author puts forth.<br /><br />After hearsay of gold, silver and wealth to be found in our present-day southwestern U. S., the Viceroy of Mexico sends Coronado with over 300 men, several hundred Mexican Indian allies, more than 1,000 horses and mules, sheep, etc. to the north in search of these fabled fortunes.<br /><br />Although the expedition as far as locating vast amounts of riches was a flop, Coronado's knowledge of the Indians and geography helped future generations of Mexico to settle and establish themselves in Arizona and New Mexico.<br /><br />One adventure after another awaits the Coronado Expedition and this is what makes the book a page turner.  There were battles fought no doubt, but basically when no alternative to peace could be reached among the Native Americans.  As Bolton asserts, Coronado was the \\"gentlemen's conqueror\\" and compared to Pizzaro, De Soto, Cortes and others his exploits were gentle and mild.<br /><br />An enjoyable and perceptive read.	2005-06-21

Supposing that even a modest percentage of his assertions could be expelled, the overbearing amount of documentation seems to be supportive of his theory, that is, with tens of thousands of men and hundreds of ships in their treasure fleets, the Chinese discovered all the continents from 1421-1423.<br /><br />Menzies' evidence is supported in maps; trade winds and currents; early European explorers' accounts; shipwrecks found and dated; DNA similarities to indigenous people throughout the world; animals and plants displaced from their natural areas; petroglyphs; Chinese artifacts found in many areas of the world dating to early 1400's; linguistic similarities all over the world; etc.  Coupled with the Chinese's high level of intellect in establishing latitudes and longitudes, ability to survive long distances at sea by having entire ships devoted to carrying food, the genius to desalinate sea water, etc. there is every reason to believe the Chinese discovered the world before Europeans.<br />Many refute the evidence but it certainly makes for an imbibing read.	2005-05-23

Except for a brief visit at an uninhabited island, the men subsist on next to nothing until some of them start to perish from lack of food, water, exertion and nature.

Although he commanded a nautical U. S. Expedition of grand importance to the field of science, it was his temperament and demeanor that caused this exploratory endeavor to escape the notoriety it deserved.<br />Through journals, letters, and narratives the author takes us on the four year journey of the United States Exploring Expedition from 1838-1842.  Goals of the Expedition included finding and mapping the hypothetical continent of Antarctica; charting hundreds of Pacific islands for future U. S. commercial purposes; surveying the coast of future Oregon and Washington for advancement in acquiring these lands; collect numerous plants, animals and geological samples along with anthropological studies of the numerous peoples encountered.<br />We voyage with the crew of over 300 men and six vessels through stormy seas, battle the gruesome cannibalistic Fijians, maneuver among colossal life-threatening Antarctica icebergs, the perils and mishaps of his ships, climb the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa with 200 plus natives for gravitational observations, etc.  Adventure after adventure lie in the pages of this book.<br />More importantly, Philbrick weaves together the events of this expedition with the disposition and conduct of all involved to make this an extremely well done character study of a commander and his men.	2005-04-19

Bent was the son of famed trader William Bent and his Cheyenne Indian wife Owl Woman. In later years he wanted to tell his story from the Indian point of view which makes this a captivating read.  For years we have been exposed to thrashings of the Native Americans from the slanted and one-sided views of Hollywood, dime novels, etc. that we oftentimes forget that there was another side to the story.<br /><br />George was raised among the Cheyenne Indians at Bent's Fort in Colorado, later schooled in Westport and St. Louis, fought as a Confederate soldier in the Civil War, rode with the renegade Cheyenne Dog Soldiers in retaliation for the horrific Sand Creek Massacre, hired as a government interpreter to the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, knew and met with the many Indian chiefs to promote peace and acted as an intermediary between both worlds.<br /><br />Throughout his entire life he was confused and frustrated as to which side of the heritage line to choose.

He did it, becoming one of England's greatest navigators.<br />Richard Hough effects a daring read of this fascinating man.  With firsthand quotes from the men who were on Cook's three voyages, the book is complete of adventure, misfortunes, perilous storms, native peoples with their ensuing customs and demeanor, geographical descriptions, disorientation, cannibalism, scurvy outbreaks, etc.<br />He joined the Royal Navy and worked his way up the ranks becoming surveyor in eastern Canada.  With honor and distinction from these years of service, he accepts a position to captain an expedition to the South Pacific for exploration and to study the Transit of Venus for astronomical observations.<br />With accolades from this voyage, Cook is again asked to lead an expedition to the South Pacific in order to discover and survey the South Pole.  Adventure after adventure follows.<br />His third and final voyage is to locate the mythical northwest passage by first journeying east around the Cape of Good Hope and then straight north through Hawaii to the northwest coast of North America.

With a plethora of plot twists, there is never a sluggish moment.<br /><br />Prior to his experiences with Cortes on the conquest of Mexico, Diaz gives us an account of his two previous expeditions with Cordova and Grijalva to the east coast of Central America from 1517-1518.  Battles were fought, different cultures were found, and gold was discovered among the indigenous people. This beaconed the governor of Cuba to send Cortes to these lands for `settlement', with the fundamental motivation for the quest of riches.<br /><br />We read of how Cortes and his men fought many battles on the trail to Montezuma's city of gold.  Cortes was indeed a smooth talker, always attempting peace efforts first by making promises and talking flattery while distributing gifts to the Indian tribes he met along the way, all the time with the underlying theme of Christianity.  This lead to a growing number of Indian allies, who for the most part had developed a deep-seated hatred for Montezuma due to his unmerciful plundering of villages for human sacrifices to please their gods.  Cortez, after nearly losing main battles to overtake Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), finally comes in with 150,000 Indian allies to conquer the city of gold.<br />For the armchair adventure seeker, this book has it all.	2005-02-02

Many of these particular land forms from Maine to Washington, from California to Florida and all points in between have been altered one way or another due to human endeavors such as:<br /><br />Colonization; agriculture in the form of farms, ranches and grazing; damming, draining and irrigation of rivers; the careless introduction of weeds and insects; lumbering and deforestation; hunting and fishing; mining; petroleum production; etc. have all influenced the way we see the country now as opposed to our first adventurers.<br /><br />We read of the early Spanish explorers venturing in the southwest and southeast, the English and French in the northeast and northwest; the lands, also in terms of flora and fauna, were drastically different in size and abundance, some taxonomic species are now extinct, some now more numerous due to open fields from tree removal; certain birds, fish and mammals filling in ecological gaps, etc.<br /><br />The explorers, to mention a few that are covered in the book, would be:<br /><br />Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, Cartier, Champlain, the Verendryes, Verrazano, LaSalle, Marquette and Jolliet, Boone, Drake, Vancouver and of course Lewis and Clark.<br /><br />It is an insightful look into how the continental United States land area has changed in 500 years.

Possibly the first expedition to traverse the Pacific into its far northern limits, Drake then heads south to explore Vancouver Island and the Columbia River, two centuries before Cook and others.<br /><br />For the most part, Drake was the gentleman's pirate, always treating his captives with the utmost regard.

A spellbinding read of adventure and exploration!  Lawrence Bergreen's writing caliber and the manner in which he incorporates that with the vast amount of research he carried out, is of a magnitude that few authors approach.<br /><br />After several setbacks in Portugal for funding, Magellan convinces Spain into financing and supporting a westward ocean expedition in 1519 to locate the mythical Strait (now named after him) to the Spice Islands.  Spices played a monumental role in 16th century Europe which resulted in animosities amongst neighboring countries.<br /><br />Starting with five ships and 260 men, the journey is a three-year, 60,000 mile nonstop undertaking of mishaps, miscalculations, misjudgements and poor luck from Spain to South America, through the Strait of Magellan at Cape Horn, across the Pacific to the Philippines, around the Cape of Good Hope and back to Spain.  This book has something for everyone:  hellish storms at sea, mutinies, scurvy, torture, lack of food and drinking water, cultures and customs of indigenous peoples met along the way (some of which may be considered x-rated), shipworms decimating vessels, living conditions aboard ship, etc. are just a few of the many misfortunes these men confronted.  During the entire course of this book the reader develops a close identity with the individual characters.<br /><br />Although Magellan does die en route to the Spice Islands and only one ship and eighteen men make it back to Spain, Bergreen brings to light the political injustices incurred upon the wrong members who did support Magellan, while at the same time the perpetrators of a major mutiny were granted valor.<br /><br />An outstanding and captivating book.	2004-12-31

Beginning in Europe, once these destitute, insolvent individuals landed in America, they pulled and pushed their way 1200 miles to the land of Zion. While eight out of the ten handcart companies were sufficiently successful, but still with their own pains and sufferings, the center of attention is on the 4th and 5th companies of 1856.<br /><br />Due to a late start, the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies of 1856 ran into an early, severe Wyoming blizzard, which resulted in many casualties and fatalities. With bone chilling cold, blinding snow, relentless winds, low provisions, fatigue and disorientation, the stories from their diaries and reminisces are shocking.<br /><br />To quote Ephraim Hanks, who was a scout for the first relief party, \\"Many of the immigrants whose extremities were frozen, lost their limbs, either whole or in part.  Many such I washed with water and castile soap, until the frozen parts would fall off, after which I would sever the shreds of flesh from the remaining portions of the limbs with my scissors.  Some of the emigrants lost toes, others fingers, and again others whole hands and feet, one woman lost both her legs below the knees and quite a number who survived became cripples for life.\\"  We experience the courage and moral strength of these pioneers.<br /><br />The appendixes include letters from Brigham Young defending his views on the handcart method of transportation, regardless of what rumors were circulating. Young further remarks that if anyone blames him for the sufferings of the handcart emigrants, \\"let the curse of God be on them and blast their substance with mildew and destruction, until their names are forgotten from the earth.\\"<br /><br />Also included in the appendixes is a letter from Millen Atwood who was with the Willie Company.  His remarks were, \\"Since I have arrived I have heard such tales of woe, though I do not know who could have told them to you; we did not suffer much; we had a little bit of snow, but that was nothing; and we had enough to eat as long as it lasted, and when that was gone you furnished us more; we fared first rate.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, Young once again comments that if he had not sent rescue teams, the Lord would have been under obligation to provide assistance by, \\"sending herds of fat buffaloes to lay down within twenty yards of their camp.\\"<br /><br />An important and captivating read.	2004-11-30

Although Hamilton's reminisces of life on the plains is without a doubt an absorbing and fast-paced read, his approach to the plethora of Indians he annihilated over the years borders the arrogant, insensitive and callous.<br />In 1842 at the age of twenty, Hamilton goes west with the legendary Bill Williams and shadows him for three years trapping, trading and living the life of a mountaineer.<br />One has to ponder the following: being involved with so many Indian battles in the 1840's and 1850's, is this why the emigrants had reasonably safe passage to the west during this time period because he 'cleared the way' for them, as he somewhat insinuates (?)<br />We do gain insight (?) as to Williams' whereabouts and disposition throughout the years Hamilton accompanied him, along with an understanding of wilderness survival, techniques and Indian character, customs and culture.<br />After all his Indian clashes up through the 1870's, Hamilton establishes a trading post at future Missoula, Montana; becomes Sheriff and Deputy U. S. Marshall at Fort Benton then settles in Yellowstone Valley.<br />This is the stuff Hollywood eats up.	2004-11-17

The years covered in this volume are 1854-1860.<br /><br />Without being overly exhaustive, a few to mention would be:<br /><br />Forty-eight year old Sarah Sutton whose 1854 wagon train had lost numbers of cattle from the Snake River westward due to alkali water, dust and exhaustion; how crowded the trails were at their time of passing; Indian occurrences along the way; etc. Sarah was very articulate in all her observations and died just before reaching the land of her dreams.<br /><br />Twenty-nine year old Mormon Sara Mousley's 1857 account of traveling to Salt Lake City. Her description of a cattle stampede is rendering; the many way-stations along the trail to aid the Saints in provisions, etc;<br /><br />Julia Anna Archibald (Holmes) who was twenty-years old in 1858 when she went to Colorado. A very outspoken advocate on women's rights. She wore the avant-garde attire `bloomers' and was somewhat admonished by others in her train. First woman to climb Pikes Peak.<br /><br />Thirty-four year old Hannah Clapp's 1859 letters from Salt Lake City to a Wisconsin newspaper lashing out at the Mormons' zealous ideologies and fanaticisms.<br /><br />And twenty-two year old Martha Missouri Moore's 1860 adventures of driving 5100 sheep to California.<br /><br />All these diaries and letters give the reader an understanding as to the resolve, determination and sacrifices these emigrants endured while traveling westward so long ago.

A must read for insight into trail life.<br /><br />The second writing is a reminesce by Jesse's nephew Jesse A. Applegate some sixty plus years later.  Young Jesse was only six and a half years old when undertaking this 1843 pilgrimage and his recollections are persuasive and touching.

It was a beacon to the thousands of trail emigrants from the 1840's through the 1860's while stocking up on supplies, livestock and repairs to wagons.<br />It also importantly served as a military safeguard to the emigrants, thwarting Indian insurgencies from the 1850's through 1870's, contributed to the principal mail line and Pony Express to California, to freighters going further west, etc. etc.<br />The authors cover not only the history of the fort itself, but also the relationship of this stronghold to other geographical areas in its region.<br />Excellent read and very presentable.	2004-10-08

Once the reader understands that this is a psychoanalytical, socio-political, cultural and philosophical study of Andrew Jackson the man, versus the times he endured, it is truly an insightful work.<br /><br />Touted as a man of iron-will, determination and unbound democratic principles, Jackson was a man for the ages which he represented.<br /><br />Praised for his efforts in the Florida Indian battles and the Battle of New Orleans against the British (and denounced by some for his disregard for orders), he nonetheless came out on top of the situation for the people and his country.<br /><br />He exhibited qualities of the self-made man and this is what swayed his popularity.  Jackson started from humble beginnings, and with his resolve and perceptiveness, became not only President of the United States for two terms, but was also looked up to as a hero with no self-limitations.	2004-08-31

He spoke his mind and he spoke it for the people: \\"The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government.\\"<br />Without a doubt, Jefferson's private life was controversial and Brodie brings this to light.  Although his personal life story reads like a soap opera, we see how both the personal and public worlds, at times, influence each other.  Brodie unfolds his relationships with such women as Betsey Walker, Maria Cosway and the slave Sally Hemings, along with delving into his enemies and friends in public circles.<br />A lengthy but fascinating read and thanks to Dr. Brodie's tenacious research efforts, the reader gains a deep understanding into the life of this extaordinary man.	2004-08-26

He was a volunteer in Fremont's army to thwart insurgents.  These and other timely events are well depicted.  Bryant's description of what happened in the horrific Donner party expedition are piercing.<br />This is an exceptional book and highly recommended for enthusiasts of the early west.	2004-08-23

To mention a few:<br /><br /> Amelia Knight details river fordings; the vast numbers of dead cattle with their ensuing stench; wagons, chains, yokes, etc. strewn along the trail; the wind and sand (&quot;them that eat the most breakfast, eat the most sand&quot;). She gave birth to her eighth child towards journey's end. Writes with much clarity.<br /><br /> Celinda Hines had the attributes of a young naturalist.

Being recently married wives of missionaries, both Walker and Eells maintained excellent daily diaries of their arduous overland journey from Missouri to Washington.  In company with two other missionary wives (Gray and Smith), they were the second group of women to cross the continent.  These overland diaries are an entrancement to read, depicting day to day life along the Oregon Trail while riding side-saddle for 1900 miles.  Mrs. Walker was oftentimes dismayed over both the long journey and the uncertain and questionable love of her husband (she was also pregnant during this journey).<br />Once in Washington, they all spent the winter of 1838-39 at the Whitman mission.  Conditions were somewhat crowded that first winter, therefore human feelings and emotions ran rampant (even amongst missionaries).<br />Mary Walker then continues her diaries for the next ten years.  They had their own mission to build and manage at Tshimakain whilst bringing salvation (attempting to) to the Spokane Indians.  Mary had six children while living at their mission.  With so many children to look after, along with cooking, cleaning, making clothes, tending livestock and the garden, etc., it was a full life.  So full in fact, she oftentimes was despondent of her purpose in life regarding the mission and raising her children.  The book ends shortly after the tragic Whitman massacre of 1847 when they then moved to the Williamette valley of Oregon.<br />At times the book can become somewhat overbearing due to the multitude of footnotes, but still a truthful look at pioneering so long ago.	2004-01-12

Their responsibilities to Spain included exploring, mapping and locating a route to the Pacific for trade possibilities, evicting British traders in its territory and promoting Indian intertribal peace to further enhance trade with Spain.  Evans' primary objective in accepting this offer was to locate the mythological Welsh Indians whose original Welsh ancestors were suppose to have settled in mid-America during the year 1170 AD.<br />Although not a completely successful mission, the Mackay-Evans expedition did produce maps of the upper Missouri which Lewis and Clark referred to on numerous occasions and opened understandings of Missouri River Indian cultures and customs.<br />Dr. Wood effectively sifts through the available journals and maps of Mackay and Evans, along with other pertinent papers and charts of the day, to make this an exciting work.	2003-11-25

As Parthenia Blank solemnly relates, \\"it makes it seem very gloomy to us to see so many of the emigrants buried on the plains\\".  At the end of her journey, Martha Read had counted 750 graves, \\"but I suppose that a small part, for there were so many campt off from the road and buried their dead\\".<br />Life on the trail also took its toll on livestock.  Martha Read further notes the tally of \\"600 dead cattle and 50 horses\\" from \\"hollow horn\\"(anthrax), alkali water, poisonous plants, \\"want of good care\\", little food, lack of foot care, etc.<br />Even in the early stages while crossing the Iowa River, Polly Coon is quoted as saying, \\"What a brittle thread has life and how uncertain that another moment is ours\\" after witnessing three men drowning during the river fording.<br />Seventeen year old Abigail Jane Scott's lengthy diary is complete not only of daily routines, observations of the countryside and the many hardships associated with trail life, but also the vivid and harrowing descriptions of the deaths of her mother and brother during the journey.

Nonetheless, she describes the relentless heat, lack of water and wood, poor grass, etc. which was typical of travel to Santa Fe, along with daily routines.<br />Mary Colby, Margaret Frink, Sarah Davis, Sophia Goodridge and Lucena Parsons all traveled the northern ,more familiar, Oregon Trail. These women give stunning details of wagon travel including: the phenomenal numbers of graves along the trail due to cholera, daily chores and mishaps, the vast numbers of emigrants along the route, dry ponds, abandoned wagons and personal belongings, river crossings, cutting grass for future livestock feed, etc.<br />We feel the persistent, annoying stings of clouds of mosquitoes along the Platte, the disturbing sights of countless numbers of human graves, the unsettling smells of innumerable dead livestock left alongside the road, feel their Indian anxieties, the sounds of nerve-racking horrendous thunderstorms, the continual unwelcomed taste of trail dust.  These women clearly illustrate what life was like traveling westward in 1850.<br />A pleasure to read.	2003-11-10

Dr. Paton's focus is on how Lewis and Clark dealt with the many medical mishaps on their nearly two and a half year expedition.<br />We read of early nineteenth century treatments for everything from fevers, frostbite, boils, hypothermia, smallpox, inflammations and snakebites to venereal disease and paralysis, along with comparisons to modern day medical science.<br />In addition to the above, Dr. Paton closely examines the symptoms and treatments of Sgt. Charles Floyd's illness up to his untimely death; investigates Sacagawea's ill health just prior to the Great Falls portage; the mysterious illnesses of Pvt. William Bratton and a Nez Perce Indian chief; and the accidental gunshot wound to Lewis. When the expedition was delayed during the return trip at the  Nez Perce camps, Clark offered his medical care and attention to the Indians in exchange for food and horses.<br />This is an insightful, enjoyable and very readable account on how wilderness medicine was performed two hundred years ago.	2003-11-03

This book portrays the relationships between Indian and white convergences when the U.S. was spreading its wings into unknown but recently acquired territories.<br />Ronda chronologically takes the reader up the Missouri River with Lewis and Clark first beginning with the Oto and Missouri Indians, followed by the Yankton Sioux, the intimidating and challenging Teton Sioux, the apprehensive Arikaras, winter life in the Mandan/Hidatsa village, the amiable Shoshones, Nez Perce and Flathead tribes and culminating with the ever so pilfering, troublesome lower Columbia River Indians.<br />What Ronda makes very clear, and what Lewis and Clark were hard pressed to alter and/or understand, were the intricate and byzantine trade network systems which existed among the various tribes.  For example, there was the Teton Sioux and Arikara trade, followed by the Mandan/Hidatsa and Assinboine trade alliances which were difficult and demanding systems to change.<br />Secondly, encouraging intertribal peace between tribes was like swimming against the current.  After decades and possibly centuries of intertribal warring, peace was not going to happen overnight.<br />If the reader is somewhat versed in the Lewis and Clark literature and assumes that there is not much else to learn from the expedition, this is an extraordinary look into a different side of the journey.	2003-10-27

The places, dates and events are real.  For those who fancy history in a novel type of setting, this is a worthy book.  After reading numerous books on the fur trade and early western Americana, it was also an enjoyable read for myself.<br />The story centers around famed mountain man Bill Sublette and all the people in his immediate circle (his brothers Andrew and Milton, Tom Fitzpatrick, Jim Bridger, Ashley, Astor, Robert Campbell, the Whitmans and Spaldings, etc.)<br />The 1830's legendary fur trade with all the nit-picking rivalry between these companies, the romanticized rendezvous', Indian confrontations, personal relationships, missionaries, pleasure seekers, etc. are all brought to life in this book.<br />The authors breath air into these individuals from the past by having them conversing with each other throughout the book, and if one is familiar with these names and places from previous readings, all the more meaningful to the reader.

Palmer is very descriptive of landforms, climate, people he met, and all the other happenstances not only along the Oregon Trail itself, but also of Oregon.  He was one of few to blaze a new wagon road from the Dalles, around Mt. Hood to the Williamette Valley, which was later referred to as the Barlow Cutoff.  Also included are excellent descriptions of the disastrous Stephen Meek wagon party; Oregon City in its infancy; advice to future emigrants; economic and agricultural possibilities in Oregon; etc.  There is also a somewhat lengthy but insightful and prophetic letter from Reverend Spalding to Palmer with his thoughts and descriptions of Oregon.<br />I did find it somewhat peculiar though that Palmer's advice to emigrants mirrors the same advice of Overton Johnson's \\"Route Across the Rocky Mountains\\" published a year earlier.  A map would be handy for those unfamiliar with the geography as the one  included is quite vague.  Still, a great book.	2003-09-10

The sixty nine men, women and children of the 1841 Bidwell-Bartleson party were the first to attempt any such overland migration to the west. Bidwell describes many features such as the disputable election of Bartleson as captain; securing Fitzpatrick as guide; praiseworthy comments on traveling companion Father DeSmet; provisions and daily routines; making roads for the wagons; buffalo stampedes; \\"cyclones\\"; half the party dividing at Soda Springs to continue traveling north with Fitzpatrick and the missionaries; getting lost a few times in Utah and Nevada due to vague geographical directions; making pack-saddles from the wood of their abandoned wagons; Bartleson and others deserting; etc. The Hubert Bancroft account of the 1842 Elija White party of one hundred twelve descibes daily routines also, along with rules and regulations for the journey; the controversial slaughtering of twenty two of the emigrants' dogs as ordered by White, thereby resulting in Lansford  Hastings elected as captain and the division of the party; the somewhat dubious tactics at Fort Laramie to obtain the emigrants' oxen and wagons in exchange for worn-out, haggard horses, and supplies at exhorbitant prices; securing Fitzpatrick as guide; etc. The 1853 James Longmire account to Washington has the emigrants traversing the treacherous Cascade Mountains, using ropes and rawhide from freshly butchered cattle to lower their wagons down steep canyon walls. Although only 104 pages, this little book gives armchair \\"overlanders\\" an intriguing glimpse into the many hardships, sacrifices and speculations these early day pioneers had to overcome.	2003-06-19

I must agree with some reviewers that the author can be quite quirky in his writing style with offbeat, way-out puns and phraseology, but nevertheless a good read. Myers justifies the many hardships of Hugh Glass through several second hand sources for those unbelievers of this somewhat, but not, fictional character. Glass was captured by pirates, escaped, then was captured by the Pawnees and later lived with them for some years. He then left the Pawnees and joined Ashley's fur expeditions to the Rockies. Many a narrow escape with Indians, but probably the most celebrated adventure of his life was the mauling by a grizzly and the ensuing tales thereof. One reviewer mentioned how they should make a movie out of this book. Well, they did, many years ago. \\"Man in the Wilderness\\" starring Richard Harris is based on Hugh Glass and his heroic adventure with the grizzly.	2003-05-15

Those readers well versed in the fur trade era are no doubt familiar with the name Ashley. What many may not be aware of is his life before and after these adventurous years in the mountains. Clokey does delve into these fur trade years of the 1820's extremely well, giving Ashley credit for initiating the annual rendezvous by bringing the goods and commodities to the mountains in exchange for the furs; paving the way for the future Overland and Oregon Trails; exploring the Green River, etc., but he also brings to light the pre and post years of this time period. Before the fur trade years, Ashley was involved in lead mining, gunpowder production, land speculation, was the leader a voluntary ranger militia to thwart Indian hostilities and had a failed attempt at running for Missouri Governor. Many of these endeavors had their ups and downs and would discourage most people from pursuing any further attempts at business. The fur trade years went quite well, Ashley sold the business but remained the agent, banker and financier for the company to market the furs. Later he went full throttle into Missouri politics, being elected for three terms into the House of Representatives. Although a controversial figure while a politician (since he claimed himself an independent Jacksonian), he nevertheless had a complete career in this profession. An insightful book about a special pioneer of the early 1800's.	2003-04-30

Jackson and the Claiming of the American West	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Fur Trade Pioneer	While the focus here is on one of our fur trade pioneers, David Jackson, the reader also gains insight as to the many economic and geopolitical strategies which went on between American and British fur companys. However, I must point out a few controversial issues. First of all, the author seems to portray two of the fur trade's icons as somewhat greedy, heartless and callous individuals: William Ashley for financial and economic gains and Jedediah Smith for exploration fame and glory. So be it. There is not enough space here for a debate. Secondly, the author is quite adamant in his view on the presence of alcohol during the first mountain rendezvous of 1825 while evidence refutes this. The only mention of alcohol in Ashley's diary of commodities during that first rendezvous is, according to Dale Morgan's scholarly work  \\"The West of William Ashley\\",  footnoted as future orders for the following year. In agreement with Morgan are other historians such as Fred Gowans (\\"Rocky Mountain Rendezvous\\"); Richard Clokey (\\"William Ashley: Enterprise and Politics in the Trans-Mississippi West\\"); Linda Hasselstrom (\\"Journal of a Mountain Man: James Clyman); and Jack Tykal (\\"Etienne Provost: Man of the Mountain\\") to name a few. I believe the author may be conjecturing on this issue. Thirdly, there is mention that Bridger floated down the Green River to taste the salt of an inland lake. Is he referring to, as one would suppose, the Great Salt Lake? Maybe I am reading this wrong, but how could he float down the Green, (which empties into the Colorado River), and then into Salt Lake? According to Bridger's biographer, J. Cecil Alter, Bridger went down the Bear River (and possibly by horse, due to the time of year) which does in fact empty into Salt Lake. Overall a good book with a stellar bibliography.	2003-04-17

From the five main jumping off points along the Missouri River: Independence, Ft. Leavenworth, St. Joe, Nebraska City and Council Bluffs, we see how all emigrant roads lead to Ft. Kearny.  From here the lengthy and laborious journey to the west followed the Platte River.  Mattes incorporates the overlander's journals with his own effective style of writing to give vivid, down-to-earth, hard-nosed descriptions of past events in such places as Ft. Kearny, Ash Hollow, Court House Rock, Chimney Rock, Scottsbluff and culminating with Ft. Laramie.  He not only communicates the difficulties endured by the emigrants themselves such as river crossings, cholera and survival, but also chronicles accounts of the Pony Express, military, Indians, stage lines, etc. and how they all played a part in Manifest Destiny.

Charbonneau was half Indian and half white, which explains his dilemma of being torn between two worlds.  Taken into custody by William Clark, Charbonneau begins his early education in both Protestant and Catholic schools in St. Louis, goes to Europe with Prince Paul of Wurttemberg for six years to continue his education and culture, comes back to St. Louis and then enters the fur trade.  As the years go by, we see how he attempts to balance himself between the Indian and white man's world.  Blevins' writing is very descriptive in detail, particulars and trivia of the present moment.  It is as though he himself was there and lived it.  I do not normally read fiction based on fact, but this is an exception to the rule.	2003-03-16

The book can also become somewhat exhaustive for some readers, with over 600 pages (including notes). At times the reader is subjected to the international diplomatic chessgames of geopolitical strategies, with the resulting ramifications thereof, between Spain, France, England and the U.S. This can, and somewhat does, act as a brain defoliant, putting the reader into periodic states of sluggishness and fog.

The book begins with a short but enlightening autobiography from Smith himself on how and why he entered the fur trade. The following chapter is the finale of his epic 1826-1827 ramble across the Great Basin from California where he and his two men nearly perished. The focus of the book is on his second California expedition to California in 1827-1828, then up to Oregon and Washington. While the second expedition was disastrous in the loss of ten men to the Mohave Indians along the Colorado River and fifteen men lost to the Umpqua Indians in Oregon, it was monumental in exploration and cartography for the United States. Sandwiched between these two massacres were confrontations with Mexican officials. Also included are letters from HBC Chief Trader McLeod on his journey with Smith back to the Umpqua River in order to recover what was stolen from Smith and his party by these marauding Indians. A very historic book because of the journals and Sullivan's thorough editing. The precursor to these journals would be the book \\"The Southwest Expedition of Jedediah S. Smith: His Personal Account of the Journey to California, 1826-1827\\", edited by George R. Brooks.	2003-01-30

The Hudson's Bay Company's policy to strip the Snake River Country of beaver to make the lands less attractive to American trappers and thus eventually to American settlement, was the purpose of Work's mission.  Work's trapping party of 115 men, women and children, 272 horses and mules and 337 traps departed from Fort Nez Perce for parts of Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Nevada.  What unfolds is a fascinating, enthralling adventure of suffering through one of the worse winters on record, along with dodging and combatting the ever persistent Blackfeet Indians.  Due to the severity of the winter, the party lost over 80 horses  from the cold.  We read of daily journal entries how grass was almost non-existent for the horses as the buffalo had already devoured most of it.  As the winter dragged on, eventually the buffalo became so lean that there was hardly any meat to be taken from them. Horses were so jaded and fatigued from lack of food, blistered feet and traveling, that at times it wasn't even worth the effort to pursue the buffalo for what food there was on them.  The Blackfeet were a constant menace, in fact killing a few of Work's party.  He had to take many preventative measures to thwart these Indian hostilities and attacks.  The introduction and footnote editing by Dr. Haines, Jr. is extremely well done.	2003-01-26

These personal journals document his explorations in the Canadian Rockies and northwestern U.S. from 1800-1811.  His responsibilities were to discover and map new trade routes for the North West Company across the mountains and eventually to the Columbia River Basin.  The journals depict the many hardships he and his men endured while on several exploratory trips: the impenetrable mountain snows; surviving severe winters of -30 F; the trials and tribulations of building trading posts, canoes, sleds; the demeanor of local Indian tribes; lack of food; etc.  As Dr. Belyea says in her introduction, &quot;David Thompson's Columbia journals require of the reader a perseverence that is well rewarded..the journals are dry and difficult..and the reader must work hard to create his or her own pattern of understanding&quot;.  It is a worthy book from an exceptional man.  The seven reproductions of maps by Arrowsmith, Thompson, etc. are quite poor in quality and I would therefore suggest an atlas for those unfamiliar with the geography of the area so as to follow his whereabouts.	2003-01-14

This could be attributed to Nelson's writing style, my unfamiliarity with Lake Superior geography and/or the plethora of French nomenclature (which can generate confusion for some).  Overall, the journals are insightful of survival strategies and day to day existence in the fur trade years of 1802-04 in northern Wisconsin.  Nelson, who was only fifteen when joining the XY Company, was a keen observer of Ojibwa Indian customs, the interrelationships between company men and his immediate surroundings.  If the writing of the journals had more continuity, it would have been an enjoyable read.	2003-01-09

From the mid 1600's up to and including the Lewis and Clark expedition, geographical mappings of the west were theoretical and conjectural, leading to misconceptions and inaccuracies in cartography and images of unexplored lands.  With  loyal support and backing from Jefferson, Lewis and Clark set out to locate the legendary water route across America for U.S. commerce, while at the same time collecting and taking notes on cartography, botany, zoology, geology, ethnology and natural resources, along with postulating future agricultural possibilities for the nation.  Although the image of a fabled water passage was shattered and the idea of a totally agrarian society was somewhat fragmented, the Lewis and Clark expedition did succeed in being the premier stepping-stone for western expansion and maintained the imagery process of the west right up to the present time.  A spellbinding read.	2003-01-04

The subject matter is very well written and structured, especially for the novice of western U.S. exploration.  We see, through the efforts of many men and decades of hit and miss exploratory attempts, how the many pieces of the geographical puzzle gradually come together to shape what we know today as the American West.  From the unyielding endeavors of Lewis and Clark, the fur trappers/traders, military, surveyors, etc. this is a wonderful and easily readable book.  The only ostentatious scar in the readings is how Gilbert once again, (see reviews under his \\"Westering Man: The Life of Joseph Walker\\" on Amazon) downplays the character, efforts and accomplishments of Jedediah Smith in favor of his hero, Joseph Walker.  With all due respect, and without a doubt, Walker was amongst the giants of early western expansionism and contributed immensely to geographical knowledge.  There is, in my opinion, no reason to incessantly reiterate the magnificance or idiosyncrasies of one over the other, both men contributed so much to the geography of the west.	2002-12-27

Beginning with Cabeza de Vaca's perilous journey across the southern U.S. in 1528 and culminating with the horrific massacre narrative of John Jewitt's shipmates and his eventual capture by the Nootka Indians off Vancouver Island in 1803, this book is teeming with adventure and excitement of early day exploration.  The reader is lured into narrative excerpts from the de Soto and Coronado expeditions, personal accounts of Sir Francis Drake, Pierre Radisson, Father Louis Hennepin, the La Verendryes, Jonathan Carver, David Thompson, Alexander Mackenzie and many more.  These men sacrificed countless nerve-racking and frightening hours of survival in the unknown wilderness from Indian hostilities, weather, shortages of food, water, etc.  The book not only opens new territories in real life exploration, it also opens endless new worlds of reading possibilities for armchair exploration enthusiasts.	2002-12-10

Extremes of desert heat, impenetrable mountain snow depths, thirst, hunger, fatigue, momentary disorientations, spatterings of Indian hostilities, indecisions of Mexican officials in Spanish California, etc. were all obstacles to conquer on the road to uncharted territories.  He attempted peace treaties between the Utes and Shoshonies, spent  time with the Mohave Indians along the Colorado River (one of the first written accounts of their culture), describes Spanish mission life in southern California, the trek northward  encountering Indian animosity, the first crossing of the Sierra Nevadas by a U.S. citizen and finally, the Herculean journey across the Great Basin to the 1827 rendezvous at Bear Lake.

Being located along the Missouri River in present day North Dakota, the Mandan/Hidatsa Indians traded horses, robes and furs to Canadian Fur Companies in return for guns and ammunition. They would then trade these goods for other commodities from various Northern Plains Indian Tribes, who previously may have traded with other tribes or the Spaniards further south. In part one, the authors give a lengthy but excellent and relevant chronological introduction as to the fur trade history of this geographical area. Part two includes five journals (or excerpts) of some of these Northwest Fur Company traders' first hand accounts depicting life as it was: John Macdonell's descriptions of the Indians, geography and trade in the 1790's; David Thompson's narrative describing his harrowing 1797 journey from Fort Assiniboine to the Mandan villages in the dead of winter; Larocque's two narratives, the \\"Missouri (1804)\\" and \\"Yellowstone (1805)\\" Journals, the latter of which, in the company with Crow Indians, he may possibly have been the first white man to descend the Yellowstone River, pre-dating William Clark by more than a year. The final narrative is of Charles McKenzie's four journeys to the Mandan villages (1804-1806), the first two in company with Larocque's expeditions. This is a fascinating read for fur trade enthusiasts and/or those whose interests are in early western exploration.	2002-11-20

The result is a highly acclaimed first hand narrative of the Sante Fe trade and life on the prairies during the 1830's.  Gregg's vivid writing style illustrates the many hardships and adventures of life along the Sante Fe Trail and into Mexico.  We read about traveling through barren deserts, inconsistencies of the weather, the always present danger of marauding Indians and Mexicans, the questionable Mexican governmental policies, etc.  Being an amateur naturalist (he had several species of plants named after him), Gregg describes geographical landforms, geology, and plant and animal life extremely well.  He also gives clear, precise and realistic descriptions of the cultures and customs of both the Indians and native Mexicans from how they dressed, to how they constructed their homes; religious, spiritual and matrimonial beliefs; how food was secured and prepared; theories on future agricultural practices and uses, etc.  Gregg was a keen and acute observer of his immediate surroundings which is evident in both his writing style and presentation of the subject.

What unfolds is a unique first hand narrative of overland travel along the Sante Fe Trail to Bent's Fort, Colorado and then on to Taos, New Mexico.  This book is supposedly the only eye witness account of the trials and hangings of the revolutionaries who attempted to overthrow the newly acquired American occupancy in Taos by murdering Govenor Charles Bent and several others.  Garrard's writing is commendable, being such that the reader feels they are right there with him.  We read descriptions of how it was to live with, travel and meet trappers, frontiersmen, mountaineers, and Indians (both friendly and hostile), go on buffalo hunts, endure starvation, lack of water, the forces of nature, etc. while in the mountains and deserts of the southwest.

John Wyeth joined his cousin Nathaniel Wyeth and several other New Englanders to travel to Oregon to seek the riches and fortunes which that land had to offer.  Although the author quit the expedition at Pierre's Hole in Idaho, he did write a first-hand narrative which is of historical significance.  He described the many hardships and sufferings which they encountered along the way; being ridiculed for Nathaniel's original mode of travel when departing from New England in so called &quot;amphibiums' (a cross betweeen a &quot;wagon and a gondola&quot;) which were given up in St. Louis; an account of the famous Battle of Pierre's Hole; and on the way home to Boston via New Orleans, a very detailed and  grotesque description of the cholera epidemic in that city.  Wyeth speaks most admirably of their veteran guide Bill Sublette, who escorted them from Independence to Pierre's Hole, and at the same time belittles, demeans and humiliates his cousin Nathaniel for his leadership abilities throughout the expedition.  I believe the author, and being only nineteen at the time, was simply too thunderstruck and bewildered by the hardships and sacrifices one must withstand to acccomplish such a feat.  Simply put, he was spoiled from the comforts and conveniences of life in Boston and should not have undertaken such a mammoth adventure. An excellent little book (only 87 pages) but with an abundance of historical importance.	2002-10-09

In addition to these responsibilities, he was to observe Native American cultures and suggest locations for future military forts for the protection of the soon to be thousands of overland emigrants. These exploration narratives are a total pleasure to read, being very descriptive, vivid and realistic as to their day to day existence. Fremont and his expeditions covered thousands of miles, gathering a plethora of information for future generations and setting the tone for westward migrations. The first one to coin the phrase \\"Great Basin\\" because of his exploration efforts; put an end to the mythical Buenaventura River legend which was suppose to be a major waterway connecting the Rockies with the Pacific; and discoverer of Lake Tahoe.

Kinnaman first gives us a brief introduction of the land area, along with the Indians, trappers and explorers who frequented the region up through the 1840's and 1850's. Citing from more diaries, journals, letters, official government documents, books, etc. he then carefully guides us through the establishments of the Overland Stage Stations and life on the Overland Trail itself with its many hardships during the early 1860's. With Fort Halleck as a pivotal point, we then see how the military influenced the region, still with Indian depredations occuring and the perils of existing in those days. The chapters on the railroad making its way through this area are captivating. Again, many Indian hostilities and other occurences too numerous to mention. It is a fascinating read, I had no idea so many events occured in this region. I must disagree though with what I believe is an historical inaccuracy. On page 19 Kinnaman states that when Ashley left the Rawlins area he went north to the Sweetwater River in 1825. According to Dale Morgan's scholarly work, \\"The West of William Ashley\\" which is based on Ashley's own diaries, from Bridger's Pass Ashley went west, then just a little north to the Dry Sandy which is a tributary of the Big Sandy, which drains into the Green River. So, he did not go to the Sweetwater. Ashley did go along the Sweetwater River the following year, 1826.	2002-09-19

When the mountain men came into the picture searching for their beaver pelts in the early 1800's, it was this breed of men that finally opened the routes across the Rocky Mountains which lead the wagon trains through to the Northwest.

He does not hesitate to tell his readers how he \\"could find water better than anyone else\\"; \\"shoot better than anyone else\\"; one of the first to take sheep from New Mexico to California; first to put through a toll road in Colorado; had the first two story building in Denver; the list goes on.

For instance, James Clyman was with Smith during many of these exploits, and his &quot;Journal of a Mountain Man&quot; wasn't published until 1928. Dale Morgan's &quot;Jedediah Smith And The Opening Of The West&quot; which was published in 1953, gives the reader a more in depth study (with more historical documentation available at the time) into the character, achievements and defeats of this remarkable man.  Neihardt's writing style is to be commended though, as he is very descriptive and expressive.	2002-05-15

While not exactly filled with tales of high adventure or edge of your seat drama, it is a good character study of relationships between Americans, Mexicans and Native Americans. The chapters on his 1846 trading venture during war time Mexico are very insightful and gives the reader a feeling for what it must have been like going through those tense and turbulent times of political unrest. A good book.	2002-04-29

Such giants of the times like Jed Smith, Jim Bridger, the Sublettes, Tom Fitzpatrick and many others are given thorough examination of their roles in attempting to capture the fur trade business, along with their exploration accomplishments of the American west. The cutthroat competition from the Hudson's Bay Company, Astor's American Fur Company and the Missouri Fur Company, not to mention Indian hostilities, hunger, thirst and the always present forces of nature, made the fur trade business a precarious way of life. If one is not familiar with the geography of the west, it would be helpful to have a map handy as there is not one in the book. There were a few typos which can be overlooked, but there is one historical blunder I must point out. This is on page 50. It is mentioned that Vanderburgh and Carson were exempted from Leavenworth's criticism of the Missouri Fur Company's handling of the Aricara battle. This is NOT Kit Carson as the index states it is. This man was Kit's older half brother Moses. Other than these few discrepancies, the book was presented very well and was a pleasure to read.	2002-04-05
US	47304339	R27ZLDWOZAJRTL	0806127244	336381921	Stephen Long and American Frontier Exploration	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Engaging	The authors do justice in refuting the many pessimistic views of Stephen Long's career as an explorer in this great little book.  Long received a plethora of negative criticism, especially after his 1819-1820 expedition across the plains to the Rocky Mountains. Some of this may be justifiable, such as not searching out the sources of the Platte, Arkansas and Red Rivers, which he had orders to do; or his nomenclature of &quot;The Great American Desert&quot;, referring to his return trip from the Rockies. The scientific contributions from his expeditions speak for themselves.  Along with publications by Long himself, there were innummerable papers and a few books from the likes of Thomas Say (zoologist), Edwin James (botanist), William Keating (geologist) and art work from Titian Peale and Samuel Seymour to vindicate the efforts of these early nineteenth century explorers.  The book was easy to follow and comprehend, and a total pleasure to read.	2002-03-18

From the Spanish endeavors of the 1700's up through John Fremont in 1843, we see how all of them were attempting to find the fabled water passage of the San Buenaventura River, which was suppose to connect the interior land area to the Pacific.  The author very diligently takes us through the efforts of such men as Garces, the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition, Peter Skene Ogden, Jedediah Smith, Joseph Walker, the first overland emmigrants of the Bartleson-Biddle Expedition up to Fremont who finally mapped and gave the area we now call the Great Basin its name.

Each chapter is thoroughly researched and written very well, with excerpts from the overlanders' journals and diaries, along with references from various newspapers throughout the country. The reader is first introduced to the political and social ramifications from the news media of the pros and cons of overland travel to Oregon and California. Next, Unruh unravels the \\"whys\\" as to the emigrants' desire to pursue such an endeavor, risking loss of everything, including possibly life itself. We also get a feel for how the overlanders got along with each other; their relations with Indians; the battles of overcoming hunger, thirst, cold, etc. There is also mention of private entrepreneurs along the trail who were trading and selling goods at exorbitant prices; the \\"white Indians\\" who were white men masqueraded as Indians taking advantage of the emigrants; the Mormon influence throughout the Salt Lake area, along with the \\"Winter Mormons\\" who were average non-Mormon emigrants wishing to overwinter in Salt Lake but subjected to cruel and unjust treatments. Then the federal goverment comes into the picture by improving roads, establishing forts along the way and implementing troops to guide and protect the overlanders to safety. We read detailed descriptions of how west coast assistance was a major factor in helping settlers make that final push into either Oregon or California. The book is totally amazing! A definite page turner. Even if one is not into Western U.S. history, this book will make one look at the hardships, perils and sacrifices these people overcame to establish a new life for themselves, families, friends and relatives.	2002-03-05

Bent's Fort is in southeastern Colorado and this book gives the history of that area along with Taos and Sante Fe.  Couldn't put the book down.  The fort bordered what was then the United States and Mexico.  We see how the Bent brothers establish a trading post along the Arkansas River in the 1830's and began a long career of not only in trading with the Indians and Mexicans, but also get involved in the uprising of hostilities between Mexico and the United States.  The cultural descriptions of our Native Americans is very well done.

This is the political and economical side of the fur trade business during the early 1800's from the point of view of John Jacob Astor and Ramsay Crooks of the American Fur Company. There is much to be learned from the book, especially relationships between the United States, England, France and Spain; establishing international boundaries; the never-ending saga of allowing (or not allowing) whiskey into the Indian country; the tense competition between the fur companies, etc. Better have a dictionary handy too as some of the wording will need defining to the average reader.	2002-02-04

After reading several books about the fur trade era and seeing this journal cited as a reference in many of them, I was somewhat disappointed after reading it. Other than giving detailed descriptions of the countryside along the Missouri River from St. Louis to the Mandan villages of North Dakota, and observations of the Indian culture and customs, the book (only 70 pages) seems to come up short. I gave it four stars because it does contain some interesting and authoritative reports of the times, depicts life along the Missouri in 1811 and gives insight into the rivalry between the two competing fur companies of Manuel Lisa and Wilson Price Hunt. It is of historical significance and should be read by enthusiasts of this time period (just don't expect edge of your seat reading).	2002-01-24

Peter Skene Ogden did just about everything imaginable during this time period.  In the year 1810, at the age of sixteen, he joined the North West Fur Company to travel and trap the vast Canadian wilderness.  After the Hudson's Bay Fur Company bought out the North West Fur Company, he then worked for the HBC.  In the 1820's he lead five trapping expeditions, called the Snake River Expeditions, into all parts of the Pacific Northwest in which he and his men (and families) faced incredible dangers and hardships of hunger, hostile Indians, mother nature, etc.  Later, Ogden was sent further up the Pacific coastline towards Alaska to establish trading posts for the HBC. This unbelievable man had so many adventures, traveled so far and accomplished so much in his lifetime.  It was a fascinating read and a wonderful book. I highly recommend it.	2002-01-21

John Sunder has done a wonderful job of research and writing in this book. It was a pleasure to read. William Sublette was a man of remarkable stature, being so instrumental in all aspects of the fur trade from the early 1820's to the mid 1830's. After reading one adventure after another during these mountain years in Wyoming, the author then takes us past these formative years to when Sublette was later a prominent farmer, businessman and political affiliate in the St. Louis area. I can see why Wyoming named a county after him.	2002-01-11

From establishing Fort Raymond at the confluence of the Big Horn River and Yellowstone River in 1807, the book takes the reader along Lisa's other adventures up the Missouri River thru 1820.  Supported by historical documentation from such men as Thomas James, John Bradbury, Henry Brackenridge and John Luttig, to the many correspondence letters from Lisa to others, Oglesby does an exemplary work piece of this man's life.  Well liked by most Indian tribes but oftentimes thought of as an abrasive and badgering individual by the whites, this is a man who simply wanted to fulfill his dreams of opening the fur trade in the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase.  The book is not just about his adventures, as it is also about the business transactions, strategies, financial responsibilities, etc. associated with the heavily competitive fur companies of the day.	2002-01-07

Day to day survival in the early American West at its best! Pick up any reputable book on the fur trade era during this time frame, and Warren Ferris' &quot;Life in the Rocky Mountains&quot; is always cited as a reference. There is good reason for this. Ferris joined the American Fur Company in 1830 at the age of nineteen and this is his journal of how life was back then from 1830-1835, so far removed from the luxuries of civlization. He spent most of his time in the central and northern Rockies, describing and recording just about everything one can possibly imagine from hostile Indians and the unrelenting forces of nature to grizzlies, days without food and water, etc. He was there at the Battle of Pierre's Hole and the death of William Vanderburgh. He also details the Yellowstone area with its geysers and other oddities, along with many other geographical areas which we now take for granted. Ferris vividly describes the many different Indian tribes of the region of their customs, cultures and habits. This is an excellent book and I can see why many historians use this book as reference material. A must read for fur trade era enthusiasts and arm chair explorers.	2002-01-02

Unless one is an enthusiast of this period of history, most people have never heard of Pilcher. After a brief career as a hatter in Kentucky, he then moved to Nashville and later to St. Louis. He began his fur trade endeavors with Manuel Lisa's Missouri Fur Company in 1819 and continued this till 1829 with many misfortunes in the business. He was involved in the famous Arikara Indian Battle on the upper Missouri, which resulted in disagreements with the army's strategy of handling this encounter. After his ventures in the fur trade, he later became Indian sub-agent, then agent, and after William Clark died in 1838, he was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs at St. Louis. This is a wonderful book well written and researched by John Sunder. Enjoyable.	2001-12-18

This is a classic of the fur trade era.  Bradbury, a botanist, went up the Missouri with the famous Astorian overland expedition of William Price Hunt, Ramsay Crooks, Donald McKenzie, naturalist Thomas Nuttall and others in 1811. His descriptions of Indian life, geology, botany, geography and overall life as it was in 1811 being so far removed from civiliztion is incredible. He was a very articulate and keen observer of the world around him. Bradbury gives further insight into Manuel Lisa, John Colter, Henry Brackenridge, trading with the Indians, etc. The last chapter he devotes to the soon to be mass immigration into the western parts of the United States.  His thoughts on this are ahead of his time. There is simply too much good to say about this timeless masterpiece. The book itself may be somewhat difficult to find, but it is worth looking for.

An excellent first hand narrative with lively and descriptive writing by one of the first pioneers to help settle the untamed Northwest.  Alexander Ross joined Astor's Pacific Fur Company expedition in 1810 and this is his story of the day to day struggles which he and the other men had to overcome.  He left New York on the soon to be ill-fated, doomed ship the Tonquin, with a pompous and overbearing Captain Thorn. They sailed around the tip of South America, then to Hawaii and finally to the mouth of the Columbia River, all the while prevailing over many hardships during this voyage. Upon landing and without delay, the men began to construct the trading post Astoria.  Ross' detailed descriptions of their adventures amidst the forces of Mother Nature, Indian relations, the Northwest Fur Company, geography, etc. makes this book a real page turner.  They all had many obstacles to overcome, and as I said, his writing skills are exemplary.  He devotes the last few chapters to the culture and customs of one of the local Indian tribes. The man was a keen and acute observer of all his surroundings and this is an energetic effort on his part to put it in writing.	2001-11-26

In 1809 James joined the St.Louis Missouri Fur Company and relates the experiences of his crew being mistreated by Manuel Lisa, then joining up with John Colter, along with several other personal accounts of the day to day activities and survival strategies they encountered.  He was one of the first to describe and take part in the trade business from St. Louis to Sante Fe and it is absorbing to read of his confrontations with the Comanches and the Spanish during these years.

Robert Campbell joined Ashley's Fur Trade Expedition in 1825, and this little book gives his own account of his adventures in the American West up to 1835. Although Campbell is cited in many historical and biographical books, documents, manuscripts and journals, he has somehow eluded notoriety amongst the more famous mountain men and fur trappers of his day. After reading this book, one can easily see that he played a very significant role during this time period. Even though the book is only sixty pages, there are many interesting stories and events which Campbell relates to the reader. The historical notation and introduction are also well done.	2001-11-12

Pike left St. Louis in 1806 to explore the present southwestern United States.He and his men suffered and endured many misfortunes and hardships while in the Colorado mountains, then only to be arrested by Spanish authorities for trespassing into their territory. I suppose the debate will go on forever, did Pike intentionally get arrested in order to further explore Mexico so that the American government would be more enlightened as to their culture, military strengths and weaknesses, geography, trade possibilities, economy,etc.?

The historical documentation/notation was overwhelmingly exhausting, boring and tedious.Simply put,too much! As far as the actual journal itself is concerned, to quote Pike in his letter of July 2, 1806 to General Wilkinson, &quot;The journal in itself will have little to strike the imagination, being a dull detail of our daily march.&quot; I agree. This is in no way to be demeaning of Pike's exploration efforts and the hardships he and his men suffered to get to the source of the Mississippi River. Pike had monumental responsibilities to accomplish. He was to find the headwaters of the Mississippi, bring peace between various Indian tribes, select future sites for government forts and trading posts, and to confer with the British establishments in the recently expanded territory of the United States.There were some highlights of the book however, one being the chapter &quot;Correspondence and Conferences&quot;, which show Pike's letters to various individuals, and his speeches to certain Indian tribes. Also, the chapter on ethnography details the cultural aspects of the different Mississippi Indian tribes, which I found interesting.

One of the first white men over South Pass, then discoverer of the Great Salt Lake, his trading post at Fort Bridger, coupled with many Indian battles, and later as guide to several military and governmental operations/expeditions, it is amazing the man lived to be seventy seven years old!

Pick up any book on this subject and you will find that this book is used as a reference. Larpenteur spent much of his time at the Fort Union trading post in present day Montana where the Yellowstone River empties into the Missouri. This is his story of how the actual trading was carried on, relationships with the Indians and resulting battles that oftentimes would occur, along with the inner relationships amongst the fur companies and military, the hardships which had to be overcome, etc. He shouldered heavy responsibilities and it is apparent that at times he would get somewhat down on himself for not accomplishing or meeting his goals.

I must agree with other reviewers and Milo Milton Quaife in his introduction, that because of Carson's nature, the book seems somewhat curtailed of descriptive events.  What may have taken a few months to happen, Kit says it all in a paragraph.  That aside, he came out west at the age of sixteen to become a mountain man. As time went by he was involved with trapping adventures, expeditions with Fremont, the Mexican War and as an Indian agent.  Maybe it was a sign of the times, but Carson certainly does not hesitate to boast about how many Indians he killed during his day to day adventures.  This may have been brought about by his upbringing as a young child.  The settlers in his part of Missouri where he was living at the time had to &quot;fort&quot; themselves against the activities of hostile Indians.  This may have carried on into adulthood.  Nevertheless, this was a good book on an extraordinary and remarkable man of the early American west.	2001-09-04

It is a vivid, comprehensive and sweeping biography of a most important and influential man of the early American West. At the age of twenty four, Thomas Fitzpatrick started out with Ashley's expedition of 1823 as a fur trapper going up the Missouri River. The following year he discovered South Pass, then was part owner of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. After the fur trade declined, he guided the first wagon train west over the Oregon Trail, then acted as guide to Fremont, Kearny and Abert on their expeditions. Later,he was appointed as an Indian Agent for the government and in this position he was most significant in facilitating relations with the Plains Indians. Leroy Hafen's writing is to be commended.

But this is what it takes to tell the whole story.  From his bibliography one can pick and choose which books are of interest to the reader and take it from there, that's what I have done.  I would recommend this book to those of you that are interested in this time period.	2001-07-16

Definitely a colorful character of the 19th century fur trade era. Whenever reading books about the early American West, one always comes across the name Joe Meek. He came out west in 1829 at the age of nineteen desperately wanting to be a mountain man/fur trapper. Adventures were many up to the last rendevous of 1840 with the typical Indian fighting, grizzlies, starvation and thirst, etc. He then helped guide the first wagon train to Oregon and had much to do with the first government of Oregon. This is a delightful story of a charming individual. He loved life and people loved Joe, just beware of the oftentimes &quot;backwoodsy&quot; grammar in the book (I could have done without that).	2001-07-02

Zenas Leonard came out to the American West as a fur trapper in 1831, this is his own narrative. He started out under the leadership of Captain Gant trapping beaver and traveling extensively throughout the west. Later he joined in with the famous Captain Joseph Walker expedition to explore a passage to California. You simply can not put this book down! Indians, grizzlies, starvation and thirst, freezing temperatures, more Indian troubles, first white men to see Yosemite and the Redwoods, one adventure after another! Vivid descriptions of what it was like back then. An engrossing book!	2001-05-21

It is along the same line of thought as Robert Utley's \\"A Life Wild and Perilious\\".  Whereas Utley's book is more of a chronological history of the fur trappers, this one is based more on geographical location.  Each chapter is devoted to an individual character and the life of that person. Many of these early trapper/traders' lives interweave with each other and therefore you have more of a tendency to remember who knew who and who did what with who, etc.  After reading chapter after chapter, it humbles one when looking back at these mens' lives and how much they accomplished, whether it be in how many places they traveled, what sort of trade they were involved in, their relationships with the Indians and each other, how some were involved with the initial founding of the west, etc. It is simply amazing what went on so long ago.  I have much respect and admiration for these men.	2001-05-04

The authors begin with the earliest known evidence of man inhabiting this area, then move on to talk about how the Indians,fur trappers and mountain men influenced this part of the west. William Ashley paved the way for the Overland Trail, Jim Bridger helped to explore this region and John Fremont mapped this part of the west. Chapters on the logging, mining and grazing industries are also very interesting. The railroad had a major fundamental part in the development of this area.  The authors also talk about the Medicine Bow National Forest and how till this day, it is still trying to be a land for multiple use. I really enjoyed this book, there is a lot of history here.	2001-04-24

He took the first United States' expedition from the west side of the Peruvian Andes,then over and through the Brazilian Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean. His desriptions of the local people and their cultures, along with how they survived, their agricultural methods and practices are fascinating.  He also includes geological, botanical and zoological observations all along the way.  He describes how difficult it was to cross the Andes at elevations above 17,000 feet, the mining industries in the mountains, what kinds of plants grow here and there, the animals they encounter.  A few unbelievable (but verifiable?) accounts were of the tailed people who lived up the Jurua tributary, the three and a half foot people, blue mud, etc.  These were all enjoyable to read.  The only drawback was the overall purpose of the expedition.  It was a way to exploit the Andes Mountains and Amazon of their natural resources, from the gold, silver, etc in the mountains to harvesting the forests for commercial use.  Just like Gary Kinder said in his foreword to the book, if Herndon was alive today, he may have a different opinion. A very good read though if you enjoy exploration.	2001-04-04

It is hard to believe someone could have done so much, seen so much, and accomplished so much in a lifetime. Totally amazing! Mountain man, explorer, trail blazer, and much, much more, from the early 1800's thru the 1870's. A true American icon. I would have given it five stars but, I didn't much care how others in the book such as Jed Smith, Jim Bridger, etc. were belittled by the author.  We all have our heroes but cutting down others when it is not really necessary or deserving is, I believe, crude.	2001-03-09

First, there were no maps to guide one along as to his whereabouts and second, Chapter 2 (and the first few pages of Chapter 3) was so long and monotonous I almost put it down.  I'm glad I did continue reading though, as this was one heck of a book!  George Frederick Ruxton was a restless young man from England who traveled to Spain (the boring chapter), Ireland, Africa, Canada, Mexico and finally to the American West in the 1840's. His writing is so vivid, descriptive and lifelike as to what it was like in those days, it's as if you were traveling right along next to him suffering from the intense, bitter cold of a Rocky Mountain winter, to shooting buffalo, deer and big horn sheep for food, getting his mules across frozen rivers,  dodging Indians and renegade Mexicans, descibing geological landforms, along with the flora, fauna and local people he encounters. It is sad that he died at such a young age, his name may have been amongst the literary giants. His &quot;Life in the Far West&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains&quot; are classics now. I enjoyed the book. A page turner (after chapter 2)!	2001-02-23

We should be grateful that there were such men as Clyman to write down history as they saw it in the early to mid 1800's.  Not many mountain men/frontiersmen were literate, and if this wasn't written down back then, it would have just been heresay.  Clyman came out with Jedediah Smith in the 1820's as a fur trapper.  He records what went on at that time.  These couple of chapters are a fascinating read.  Then in the early 1840's, he came out with the Oregon Trail emigrants.  He was a very observant individual, describing not only the climate, but also geology, flora, fauna, agriculture, etc. along the way.  There was a section in the book where he talks about &quot;time and space&quot; which really surprised me about how deep a thinker the man was...he was very intelligent, also writting poetry and prose.  If you want to know what it was like then, read this book...it's a good one!	2001-02-08

Candy Moulton gives the reader an excellent historical review of the Jackson Hole, Wyoming area, back when it was being homesteaded.  We get to see and feel the hardships of what these people went through in the 1800's...from how they built their homes, plowed their fields, put up with inclement weather... along with a major natural disaster in the 1920's which affected many of the folks in the valley. I've been to the beautiful Teton area a few times, and never really gave it a thought as to what went on there so long ago.  I enjoyed the book a bunch.  Good job Candy!	2001-02-06

Hipolito Ruiz was a Spanish botanist in Peru and Chile from 1777-1788. Along with all the many hardships which he encountered back in those days, he observed and recorded the many different kinds of medicinal and non-medicinal plants which the natives used. It truly is a fascinating account of his travels and what it was actually like in the 1700's. Along with being an adventure in ethnobotanical exploration , it is also a cultural portrayal of the peoples who lived there. I also enjoyed the appendix at the end of the book which lists the medicinal plants in alphabetical order which are mentioned in the text.  Maybe this book should be required reading for medical students (?). Could be a cure for cancer, aides, etc. down there (!)	2001-01-26

Robert Stuart originally left New York on the ship the Tonquin, funded by John Jacob Astor, and sailed around the tip of South America and then eventually up to the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon to establish a trading post.  Stuart then proceeded to head back east  to report to Astor about the state of affairs of the trading fort.  With only a handful of men, they went by canoe, horseback and mostly by foot, from the mouth of the Columbia to St. Louis, then eventually to New York.  This historical narrative is beyond words.  They faced the hardships of hunger, fatigue, Indians, weather, and about everything else one can think of.  It is truly a fascinating portrayal of day to day survival in the 1812 wilderness written from the hand of the man who was there.  What I also enjoyed about the book was the Appendix on Wilson Price Hunt who, also working for Astor, took an expedition by land from St. Louis to Oregon at about the same time. His written account is also mind-blowing and puts the whole book into perspective. There is also an excellent forward by Rollins which gives you a background on what you are about to read.	2001-01-25

A remarkable firsthand account of how it was back in the 1830's to early 1840's to be a fur trapper/trader in the Rocky Mountains. Russell lived it and told it like it was back then. One of few mountain men to keep a journal. I like how he gets quite descriptive in the day to day adventures and activities that he had to do for survival. An excellent book.	2001-01-23

Not only is this a good follow up to Ambrose's \\"Unduanted Courage\\", but also to Bernard De Voto's \\"Across the Wide Missouri\\". Utley gives a very well documented and descriptive look into the lives of many of our famous mountain men and how they shaped and formed the early American West. Starting with John Colter, he interweaves his way through the life and times of Jedediah Smith, Ewing Young, Bill Sublette, Kit Carson, John Fremont and others. From early fur trappers, traders, explorers and cartographers, Utley does a most commendable piece of work in this book. I enjoyed it immensely.	2001-01-17

Enjoyable because Beery's style of writing is so smooth and captivating.  Meaningful because after living here in Laramie for some thirty odd years, it was gratifying to learn of all these historical people, the places, and the events, which shaped this town.  Laramie was a rough and tough place to live in those times, and the characters in this book, although now long gone, simply come alive. I would highly recommend it.	2001-01-16

This is a definite must read for early American West enthusiasts.  Jed Smith's accomplishments, hardships and endeavors were in my opinion, unmatched by any others of his time.  He was &quot;the&quot; mountain man!  During the early days of exploration and expansion of the American West, Smith's courage and determination were beyond belief.  The man was everywhere west of the Mississippi...it's unbelievable how much territory he covered!  He was also the first white man to see and observe many of the places we all now take for granted.  If you read only one book about the early American West...this should be the one.	2001-01-11

Bill Gulick gives a command performance in this book of the Nez Perce Indians.  He depicts the life and times of these Indians so clearly...from the time they befriended the Lewis and Clark Expedition in September of 1805 and the years to follow, including all the historical documentation leading up to the plight of Chief Joseph and hundreds of his people into exile.  The story doesn't stop here either.  He also documents what happened after the famous 1877 Battle of Bear's Paw in Montana and how they were all sent off to reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma, soon to be subjected to other hardships.  I would highly recommend this book to those interested in this part of America's past.  Mr.Gulick indeed did his homework!	2001-01-09

I found this book a total pleasure to read.  Couldn't put it down!  Although it is true that Colter's life was somewhat obscure by a lack of more historical documentation, Harris does an exemplary piece of work with what there is to work with.  Citing such references as William Clark, Thomas James, Brackenridge, Bradbury and others, Harris does make a justifiable attempt to back up his story.  Required reading for those into this time period of the early American West when mountain men roamed the wide open spaces,  high mountain valleys and peaks.  It must have been a tough, but very rewarding way of life...if you survived the perils and hardships of that day.	2001-01-05
