Self aware, highly intelligent tanks which applied themselfselves selflessly to their duty. This book has gone a long way from there. From a military point it is unbelievable, even in its most basic tenets. David Drake assumes vast strides in technology and comes up with 170 ton tanks; well okay so it is SF. Here we see a 32000 ton &quot;tank&quot;. If there is one thing military history has taught about armour it is to use tanks together in highly mobile formations. You only use very heavy stuff if you want to invite defeat. Using armour out of support range is to invite defeat. Here a single damaged Bolo takes on an enemy which not only was victorious but has had a year on planet to replenish itself, and and has vast numbers of highly intelligent weapons under a unified command. Please!<br />The first 150 pages consist of how deep humans have fallen and their bickering and complaining (reading one in ten words is quite enough). In the rest of the book there is action. This can perhaps be best illustrated by the Bolo's fight in the closing pages. The Bolo, in its own words, fires &quot;fusillade after shrieking fusillade&quot; with &quot;all remaining weapons&quot;. A little later it &quot;redoubles its hammerings&quot; in spite of increasing damage. A little later onwards it &quot;gathers its power&quot;. All in all the book reads like one of Ron Hubbard's efforts.	2003-10-01

This is presented as SF, but rather is a detective that has been sprinkled with some sf-ish sauce to hide the fact that it is a backthrow to earlier days. As for the rest, format is not really clear. Likely the main character is a Captain Parry (he is the only one consistently present): an elderly englishman with a tendency to lie to himself and his surroundings. It is unclear if there is an actual storyline. <br />Only to be recommended for people with lots of time on their hands and a desire to critize a poorly written book.	2003-09-10

This is a reprint of two c 1980 books when b&amp;w pictures were still acceptable, and the book uses very many. Maybe this will grow on the reader after a while, and there are also some illuminating line-drawings but the initial effect of this volume on the unprepared reader is depressing: all those hard to make out greyish b&amp;w pictures. This is not helped by the fact that many feature an elderly, out of shape gentleman. Definitely not a coffee-table book!	2003-05-17

I am using this as a dictionary to look up technical terms: it does cover a lot of ground.<br />Although there are some great pictures in here, on the whole it is too crowded to be useful other than as a dictionary or for getting a few quick pointers. For instance the section on wood has the wood samples so closely together in the pictures that nothing much can be seen of any of them. These same woods are much better treated in 'The_Good_Wood_Handbook' by the same authors (2/3). The same goes (to some extent) for the sections on tools (quite a few of them DO look dated).<br />There is so much in this book that it must be value for money, but actually it is too crammed full of all sorts of stuff to be likable.	2003-05-17

The first three quarters of the book move right along, not too many characters, neatly divided between the good and the bad, and a clear if somewhat simple plot. Then, when the story is set for a nice (if perhaps unimaginative) finish, suddenly a lot of complications are thrown in as if the writer forgot his 101 writing class (open story: main character suddenly in trouble and has to do something to get out of trouble, take it from there till main character is out of trouble). From then on there is to much trouble for JOAT to do anything about it, nothing makes sense, everybody does just the opposite of what they promised to do and JOAT is thrown back and forth like a rag dol, boom, fortunately she lands in the black, somehow (how?).

As a rule anything on the physical world will tend to be sketchy. Anything to do with war and combat will be flat, with pretty colors. On the upside, female fantasy authors will generally have interesting characters, set in interesting cultures. Too, they will devote some attention to their writing style.<br />The downside is present here, but not the upside. The writing style is poor, and it is entirely unclear who does or says what. A reader wanting to follow current conversation would have to go back and forth through the text, piecing bits of the puzzle together. This goes for the characters too, of whom there are very many (in fact all the characters introduced in the three previous thick volumes still hang around). In practice this can be solved by mentally lumping the characters and their actions: the characters all are of a generic nature, and are interchangeable with each other and those in other books by other authors. The predictability of the plot, such as it is, helps too.<br />It would seem this is typically a book for the reader who has read a lot of fantasy, knows what to expect and can get by reading only a few words per page.	2002-09-22

Still, it is not up to the standards of Pournelle. Its predecessor &quot;Prince_of_mercenaries&quot;, although somewhat disjointed, as if put together from odds and ends, had a lot more power. <br />The impression I get is that the Falkenberg universe and characters have been turned over to a new writer, a writer who took his courses in creative writing and who well knows the US military manuals. Pournelle's work was compelling reading and could be regarded as SF (some thinking went into its writing). This &quot;Go_tell_the_Spartans&quot; reads like current US military doctrine overlaid with a Falkenberg veneer. <br />Since this is fairly competently done with only minor violations of the Falkenberg characters a fan of the 42nd can still like this book. The exceptionally poor ending is understandable: it was necessary to leave plenty of openings for its sequel.	2002-08-07

In many ways comparable to 'Rolling_Hot' (a desperate foray by troops that are past it, but have to perform anyway). It differs in that it lacks a plot: the desperate troops are not aiming to achieve something. An untypical element are the citizens who get drafted to act as unarmed co-combatants. Also it is untypical in that the enemy is not human, but alien or vegetable. There is a lot of shooting and destruction but relatively little bloodletting. The deus-ex-machina-ending looks as if tacked on as an afterthought.	2002-06-29

There really is not much action, other than on a personal level, and what action there is remains very vague. The outline of this book looks as if it was thought up by a housewife with a fondness for cats. All in all, the building blocks that went into this book are very meager, less than 1% of what went into &quot;Ring_World&quot;.

It is not really believable, but if one accepts that, it is a real page turner.

In this book he has to top that and he does. One wonders what he will attack singlehandedly in the third volume? Perhaps the enemy's main naval base?

As to plots, scenery, science and technology there is nothing very original in the book. It has a feel about it of being written as a script for a movie, complete with a feel-good ending. But, except for the first few pages, it moves right along in a fairly even pace, maintaining tension. The most interesting bit is the part of the Fuzzies (no relation of H.Beam Piper's creation), an interesting speculation on how alien ET's can get.

So maybe MZB was not really involved, but who is waiting for a repeat of &quot;The_Heirs_of_Hammerfell&quot;? At least now we are spared a spurious bit of time travel and the obligatory &quot;new&quot; laran power that MZB seemed to insist on for each book. The story-line is about what is to be expected for a Darkover novel. Bonuses are the slick way Herm Aldaran handles his religious nonsense spouting wife (sounds like an Oprah-convert) by going along with her. A very weak point is the laran battle (very contrived) and the actual funeral (all through the book people talk to each other over vast differences on the slightest pretext and at the grave's edge they suddenly appear to have forgotten about this power). All in all an above average Darkover novel, I'd say.	2001-03-01

As SF it is very much dated: the &quot;science&quot; is ludicrous by today's standards. Despite the comments of other reviewers there is not really all that much politics in it. I have reread this a few times (one of the few books that allow this) and find it gets better each time I read it. I feel this is a book that very much expresses Heinlein's philosophy, and can hold its own beside &quot;Space_Cadet&quot; and &quot;Starship_Troopers&quot;. The one-dimensional young female character so typical of Heinlein's later work is here, but in reasonable proportions (I will go with the mainstream view that Heinlein never wrote anything worth reading after 1961). I guess this indeed is a classic although it is full of laughably silly little details.	2001-02-20

The general setting is a rip-off of a  WW II naval scene: battleships, cruisers, destroyers and carriers. These  last carry fighters and torpedobombers. Highly curious is that the smaller  the craft are the faster they are and they even each have a top speed (in  space!!!). The plot is highly disjointed: there is a space captain who  previous to the novel has carefully planned and manoevred to outwit a  star-spanning confederation. Whenever this supposedly subtle and  knowledgeable person makes an appearance she proves to be a egotistical and  genocidal maniac who cannot plan ahead for five minutes! People who make  vast contributions to society are actively pursued and killed by this same  society. There is a rebellion, which ticks off a lot of people and at the  moment the rebels surrender the ones who were angry at the rebels rebel  themselves. This book reads like one of David Drake's terrible tales of  bloodletting and disjointed violence without Drake's excuse of people who  are in over their heads and fighting to save their own lives. In Peter  Telep's mind the human race is shallow and vicious indeed. [I sure am glad  I did not pay full price for this book but picked one up out of a  remaindered batch]	2000-09-07

I did not notice much science, and  certainly the author did not look into the science of naming animal  species. There is a lot of technical stuff about the mechanics of space  flight, but I would not call that science any more than a description of  the parts that go into a television. There is a curious pattern of the  protagonists doing a lot of complex arithmetic, throwing up their hands in  utter despair, and finding a little later that they had overlooked the  obvious. If this passes for science in space flight it certainly explains  why everything NASA does goes overbudget (not to mention the defense  industry).<br />All in all a rather meagre effort by the author of  &quot;Dragons' egg&quot;. A good editor could have scratched 100 to 150  pages of this book without eliminating a bit of real science or damaging  the story line (such as it is).

The &quot;hero&quot; N'Doch is an all too common and  quite recognisable product of the unrestrained breeding programs that  Churches implement in Third World countries. In the book he is intimately  exposed to enormous and magical goodness but stays &quot;bad to the  bone&quot;. How are we expected to survive with millions of such guys in  existence and not a dragon in sight?	2000-08-02

Full of complexities and paradoxes, this is a really compassionate story of  human choices in the face of hardship. Good SF. Not really fast paced, but  moves right along, full of suspense. A great pity it is out of  print.<br />Note: this is definitely one or two classes above the later  &quot;Dragon quartet&quot; by the first author which, although not really  bad, is much more one-dimensional and is pure fantasy, a much easier genre  to write.	2000-07-31

This might be slightly superior to the others since all the main characters are introduced separately in a short story each, obviating the need for a long drawn-out  bloodbath as in most Slammer stories. For most of the book the actual  combat vehicles are missing, although these make a surprise entrance in the  last chapter, apparently more for sentimental reasons than for the sake of  the story.<br />In short: if you like the Slammers buy this. If you don't know  what the Slammers are leave it in the bookstore.	2000-07-29

There still is quite a bit of bloodletting and it is fast paced, but the set of characters is un-Drake like and much better balanced. This has very much the flavor of the  Hornblower-series with slight overtones of the Aubrey-Maturin  series.<br />Indeed the story is a little forced to fit into that format (the  whiz-kid librarian in particular stretches belief) but a very commendable  effort. It is not that easy to transpose Hornblower into space! Very  enjoyable.	2000-07-29

He wrote an extensive number of books, always quite workmanlike. The earlier part of his oevre is  quite imaginative, constantly picking up an interesting SF idea of one sort  or the other. The later part, e.g. the trilogy on the &quot;wooden  spaceships&quot;, is a bit of a let down. At least Bob Shaw did not decline  as fast or as sadly as Heinlein. He died in 1996.<br />&quot;Ship of  Strangers&quot; is dedicated to AE van Vogt and is patterned on the classic  &quot;The Voyage of the Space Beagle&quot;. A ship with a mission to map  planets brings the protagonist in a series of alien situations. Compared to  the &quot;Space Beagle&quot; the ship is a lot smaller, does not have a  nexologist, but does have an AI. The general run of adventures is more  straightforward, as are the characters.

However, equally obvious this is not SF (strictly speaking) but rather meta-SF. <br />By this I mean that SF pictures how changes in technology lead to future societies, with new problems, new solutions, etc. \\"Ancient shores\\" shows how the existence of SF, as a genre, affects the here and now. It is about SF: meta-SF.<br />True, there is indeed an ancient alien device unearthed and it does do incomprehensible things, but the actual nature of the alien artifact does not influence the story. The archaeological alien device is more of a sideline, probably inserted by force of habit. It could be interchanged for a magical flying carpet or a bridge playing computer transported back out of the future, without any effect on the story whatsoever.<br />The book is a string of scenes picturing contemporary society and presents McDevitt's views of the world we live in. For such a contemplative book it is a miracle of concise writing. McDevitt covers a wide range of topics and does this lightly.	2000-06-21

They are quite wordy and rather  contrived. I am afraid I don't understand half the contents and this is  mostly because of the way concepts are presented: cloaked and crowded  together.<br />One evocative example: somewhere in the second half of the  series there is a bar where the owner is supposed to have added something  to the beer to make people drink more. Big surpise: it has alway been in  beer and is called alcohol! I have the feeling that this is typical of the  whole: many stale ideas repackaged to make them seem new.

Clearly she is a terrific writer, very imaginative, and indeed it is not apparent that she is an African  American female writer. She is a terrific writer, period. My all-time  favorite is &quot;Survivor&quot;, a very straightforward but gripping  story.<br />I can't say I liked &quot;Kindred&quot; at all, and the reason for  this is simple: it is an antithesis of her other work. Everything that  makes mrs Butler's work great is absent here and everything that makes mrs  Butler's work weak is abundantly present here. There are no science fiction  elements present (as Larry Niven pointed out, time travel is strictly a  fantasy theme, and unless you use it to get a view of the future it has  nothing to do with sci fi) and this book is overwhelmingly African  American. It is a historical novel with a fantasy twist.<br />All those  reviewers that claim they don't usually like science fiction but do like  &quot;Kindred&quot; obviously wouldn't know sci fi if they met it.<br />Mrs  Butler even at her worst (as here) is still a competent writer so two  stars, but anyone who likes science fiction is advised to stay well clear  of this.

In this case the authors seem to have succeeded pretty well. The Gripping Hand certainly is a more mature book than the The Mote in God's eye, and is highly readable. All in  all it may even be better!<br />This in contrast to The Ringworld Throne, the  sequel to Ringworld and The Ringworld Engineers, which really drags and  contains a lot of soppy material that slopped over from Destiny's Road,  another book unworthy of a great author.	2000-05-28

Indeed there are things which might be improved, but I wouldn't know how. Indeed it does not manage to keep up the roaring pace it starts off with, but it carries on quite adequately. Of  course it has been written some time ago, and people nowadays are spoiled  by the fancy optic effects of contemporary SF movies, and by great story  tellers like Orson Scott Card, but leaving such superficialities aside, I  have never seen anything that can even touch Ringworld.<br />By the way, Orson  Scott Card may be a terrific story teller, but, to say it gently, his work  is out and out fantasy, never touching reality. He should have quit after  &quot;Ender's game&quot; (the 1977 short story that is) and waited until he  had a worthwhile story to tell.	2000-05-28

After reading it I bought a second copy to give away sometime; I also expected to have fun rereading it. However I  didn't. I am not sure why, but I guess that the book lacks unity. There is  great military SF here, as well as political reflection, as well as human  tragedy, as well as an alien race, and all this within the framework of a  mystery novel. So I can see why, in spite of some truly mindblowing stuff,  this book was remaindered.	2000-05-05
