Packing thousands of sailors and marines onboard surface ships to relive WW2 with lots of high tech gadgets is a recipe for fatal disaster. Long-range patrol aviation and heavy bombers can not only detect but sink large, ponderous surface fleets. The Navy had in the 600 mph P6M SeaMaster patrol seaplane jet bomber a weapon system that could strike deep and not need thousands of men at risk in vulnerable aircraft carriers. The situation today with the advent of space surveillance and guided anti-ship missiles has only made the urgency to deploy modern seaplanes even greater. The enemy to progress here is those who want to relive WW2 in aircraft carriers and expensive, bloated amphibious ships, and we are asking for another Pearl Harbor type disaster.	2005-06-23

He along with his men had simply too much time on their hands as simplistic light infantry narcissists in the 10th Mountain Division, so they rough-housed and did pranks. The indictment is on the Army for taking a dumb jock mentality and not showing Exum how to study his profession so his men would do more than just sports PT and get drunk. Things like land mines and RPGs would be understood so they'd be not complacent with Humvees and other wheeled trucks like Strykers and instead be properly adapted in high technology M113 Gavin light tracks so they wouldn't have to make up new buzzwords like \\"IEwhatevers\\" to cover for their flag-draped coffin creating incompetence. When they finally go to Kuwait they do not even know how to operate the BS Humvee trucks they have, when they arrive in Afghanistan they are physically unready for the load carrying and altitudes. What do you expect if you spend half the day playing high school running club and the other half doing lawn and building custodial care? Exum is a typical clone of the ROTC-IOBC-Ranger school mill who walks away thinking all you need to be is a narcissist snob with a rifle-in-your-hand-and-a-rucksack-on-your-back to fight wars. Did he reflect on recent military operations when such techniques were inadequate? Was there any constructive self-criticism that maybe WE LACKED MOBILITY AND THE ENEMY GOT AWAY IN AFGHANISTAN? Osama Bin Laden is more than just a photo on Exum's wall back at Fort Drum. Did he pro-actively study getting mules, bikes or carts or tracked armored vehicles to improve his mobility? No. He was too busy reading Somerset Maughm when he should have been reading John English's On Infantry or Bolger's Dragons at War or Death Ground. WHY ISN'T HE READING ABOUT THE PROFESSION OF ARMS? His head isn't in the \\"game\\"--but war is no game.<br /><br />In short, he had no professional knowledge to fill in the vacuum of a light infantry unit with nothing to do. His maturity level was not much higher than that of the Nintendo generation enlisted Soldiers he was in charge of. His account of a light infantry unit in the Army shows there is no excuse whatsoever for them not being supplied with easy-to-maintain light tracked armored fighting vehicles like M113 Gavins or Bv206S Ridgways as the Air-Mech-Strike authors propose to enable them to fight in open and closed terrains where you cannot walk wherever you go and to fight better in general than carrying too much gear on your back. He didn't mention that the Canadian light infantry helicoptered in Bv206 tracks during the Whale operation to carry their loads better than the pathetic rubber-tired M-GATOR ATVs the Army uses. He is far too in love with the snobby U.S. military status quo because he depends on it to define who he is; he sees himself as superior to the \\"support\\" Soldiers in the rest of the Army without whom there'd be no Army. His stunt with the Soldiers in the bus should have resulted in him being relieved since he doesn't understand that allegedly \\"safe\\", \\"rear\\" areas is exactly where sub-national terrorists would strike; dude remember 9/11?<br /><br />Exum's immaturity doesn't even stop when they are in the mountains of Afghanistan exhausted and out of food---he fashions a makeshift ball to play soccer!  After the battle, he scolds several of his who men crack up from the stresses of war he himself failed to prepare them for because he spent too much time in prank bonding. Clearly Army ROTC has to change dramatically beyond the current narcissistic light infantry and give all officers a realistic depiction of the battlefield dominated by high explosives and the mechanized means needed to prevail in such a lethal, non-linear arena. M113 Gavin light tracks need to be supplied to every ROTC to counter-balance the cheap and easy light-itis quasi-training received there. Hands-on training with what every weapon and explosives will do to various targets needs to occur so ignorant young officers like Exum don't proclaim machine guns on top of vehicles are worthless in the face of enemies with RPGs when they are one of the very things you can use to suppress their aim.<br /><br />In conclusion, I pity Exum the narcissist who hurt his knee and can no longer pursue an egomaniac's dream of an Army officer career to general's stars. He sadly thinks that he has already \\"peaked\\" in his life because in his mind's eye, his life's value is measured in ACHIEVEMENTS instead of the truth that everyone of us has intrinsic value because we are human beings made in God's image. He viewed military service and war a means to \\"validate\\" his existence and this burning co-dependant \\"chip on his shoulder\\" obscures the path to real professionalism that realizes war is a necessary evil and to get on with the job not ego-centric acts. Earlier in the book, he wrote known lies in his job as a Fort Lewis public affairs author and did not have any moral courage to refuse to go along with this because it would have been bad for his career. Later in the book, after Afghanistan, he uses cognitive dissonance to excuse away killing in war as being in a separate \\"box\\" all to itself from his alleged Christian faith in peacetime life. Such a man who is not willing to face problems head-on and reconcile them according to a sense of honor has no moral center and will rationalize and conform to corruption rather than take a stand and fight it. We are lucky Exum is no longer in Army service since there is no guarantee that he will change anything since he can conveniently rationalize failings and corruptions into a ready-made mental closet. Had he continued in service its likely he would have magnified his weak understanding of war as a giant lark of dumb jocks and made the current mess even worse than it is. The only redeeming value he has is that he says he cares for the men, contemplates and reflects; hopefully he will get some better data and information to draw on than his narrow and inadequate Army officer mill training and figure this all out.such a lethal, non-linear arena.

US	50000546	R2J23WT5AKVF4F	055380376X	682515279	The March Up: Taking Baghdad with the 1st Marine Division	Books	1	5	14	N	N	Ooops! U.S. Army took Baghdad, USMC AWOL for 6 days says authors	The world knows the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division was the first into Baghdad on April 3, 2003 and the marines got bogged down and didn't arrive until many days later allowing Saddam and his followers to escape and start a guerrilla war which has killed over 2,500 and wounded over 20,000 Americans. Though this book is an attempt at self-love through USMC glorification it reveals WHY the marines failed and brought on the occupation debacle we now call \\"Iraq\\".<br /><br />The book reveals that the USMC force structure where a regimental combat team's (RCT) 750 vehicles are unarmored trucks that cannot swim, need roads and cannot drive through enemy held areas results in them having to stop and dismount infantry just to clear small bands of Fedayeen rear guards which plays right into their wish of delaying us to enable the Iraqi guerrilla war personnel to disperse with all kinds of high explosives and take up positions, create safe houses etc. For all of West/Smith's bragging about \\"maneuver warfare\\" as a USMC creation (conveniently not mentioning the leading role civilian Bill Lind played just to get a token name-only adoption by HQMC), the slowness of the marine \\"march\\" to clear small towns of a few shooters contradicts their claims that they would use \\"speed and maneuver\\" to take out the Saddam regime's center of gravity....when it was the U.S. Army in armored tracks that actually took Baghdad in reality. The authors further describe how the RCT gypsy convention was a typical thrown together ad hoc affair with strangers at the last minute---its no surprise that marines are driving into water-filled ditches in non-swimming vehicles and drowning and others are being run over as they slept at night as the authors describe. The authors reveal the truth that there was not much of a fight leading up to Baghdad as most of the Iraqi Army refused to fight and left their weapons where the stood; yet the USMC weak force structure resulted in them being road bound and needed bridges to cross 3 Iraqi rivers despite claiming to be an \\"amphibious\\" unit. With no effective tracked \\"cavalry\\" to screen the way ahead, and the main body not in low-ground pressure tracked vehicles to avoid paved roads, their flimsy Humvee, FAV dune buggies and LAV trucks on wheels are ignored by the enemy and the entire USMC main body full of Jessica Lynch-type unarmored and unarmed trucks gets ambushed when they try to pass along predictable roads.<br /><br />The authors further reveal other USMC failings even in the few (250) armored vehicles in the ad hoc mechanized warfare on-the-job training session: their AAV-7 amphibious tractors are huge targets without gunshields for the troops to fight from to suppress enemy RPG gunners or thermals to drive through smokescreens they could have layed to mask themselves from the horrific RPG hits that incinerated several amtracks. The amtracks bloated and oversized to carry 25 marines are easy targets for enemy RPG gunners and packed full of ammunition so when pierced, a hot shard of spall hits an AT4 rocket on a marine's leg exploding the entire vehicle and killing everyone inside the inferno. Despite the author's claims that the USMC employs constructive self-criticism (see end of book) they are continuing to waste $Billions of tax dollars of an AAV-7 replacement that will water ski but still be a huge, easy target to kill on future non-linear battlefields. Smith/West offer no constructive USMC self-criticism in this lovefest, but you can read in between the lines. Not only will the AAAV (now called EFV) be a bloated target on land it will be too heavy to fly by C-130 or marine helicopters--even if they could carry full payloads. The authors reveal that the USMC can no longer do heliborne assaults in CH-46 helicopters which are payload limited to just ash 'n trash missions like picking up the wounded and dead. Thus, this so-called \\"maneuver warfare\\" force cannot use any 3D maneuver to land troops ahead of the main bodyto seize things they need like bridges with coup de main. Enlightened readers will know that the decrepit CH-46s are still being used because the USMC is wasting more billions on the V-22 tilt-rotor contraption that has killed 30 people in testing and simply doesn't work rather than be humble and buy Army UH-60 Blackhawks which are combat proven. In West/Smith's Vietnam generation they were at least smart enough to adopt the Army's Huey and Hueycobra helicopters when the need arises, not so today's egomaniac USMC. The irony is that the Corps' only combat helicopters flying overhead in the author's account (and today) are Vietnam-era relics received from the Army.<br /><br />The book is an important and truthful account showing USMC failures and this I suspect is why its not \\"popular\\" with the current crop of narcissists on the taxpayer's pay roll. It reveals constantly how the long-range fires of the few M1 Abrams heavy tanks (another weapon system from the Army) are the things that are killing the few enemy stay-behinds being encountered and the immature egomaniac foot infantry is in a funk about no glory for them as the authors report. Since when is war about a chance to prove your manhood? Whatever happened to getting the job done fast and with minimal friendly and civilian casualties? Welcome to mechanized warfare in the desert where RANGE and speedy tracked mobility with ARMOR to get across open terrain is everything! The thing that is damning for the author's soundness of tactical understanding is how they start the book off trying to claim the USMC is a modern day equivalent of Greek foot infantry when for the majority of the time THEY ARE MOUNTED and not walking; the book's title is therefore erroneous. Only in the ego-driven marine mind could you be in a motor vehicle for days at a time and somehow think the movement was a foot \\"march\\". The only good things the marines sort of did was \\"LOG LITE\\" where they would clear a section of highway temporarily for a C-130 to land and roll off 6,000 gallon's worth of rubber fuel bladders and take-off again. The armored vehicles had FLEX-CELL bladders with 50 gallons of fuel that would have been helpful if they were in a light tracked armored fighting vehicle like an up-armored M113 Gavin that could swim and have kept going to reach Baghdad on time with the Army. But since the marines were on wheels and could not swim for the most part, fuel self-sufficiency yielded no operational mobility pay-off. The gypsy racks of 5 gallons of water and/or fuel on the backs of unarmored Humvee trucks are troubling in light of the ammunition cook-off deaths and reveals the USMC simply has no appreciation for the lethality of the modern battlefield derived from their feel-good, scripted training events in peacetime. Full of themselves, the marines do not \\"what if\\" what they do out of any respect for either the earth or the enemy and the failed movement to Baghdad is the result. After being AWOL for several says as the Army waited in their sector, they proceed to inhabit former ruling party palaces and then wonder why we are not seen as liberators and as occupiers?<br /><br />Overall, if you ignore the USMC self-worship parts of the book, the authors are telling the truth of how the marines are a collection of weak co-dependants who need the outfit telling them what to do and how to do it all the time to prop up weak people who need to belong in something acting as a sort of soothing parent figures. The authors praise such lemming mentalities and then reveal through the book's narrative how when applied to a non-linear war setting there is little to work with once the shooting starts since the entire outfit disdains thinking and tangible equipment preparations in favor of relying on foot infantry hubris when its the motor vehicles and tracked M1 heavy tank's firepower that actually carries the day. They lament how high technology has not improved the foot Soldier but have been singularly guilty for not rethinking ALL aspects of how they operate to employ technology to include their sacred cow status for their infantry and their anti-armored vehicle ad hoc and half-hearted mindset. An amphibious ship can carry hundred of tracked armored vehicles, yet the USMC chooses to be stupid and fills them with vulnerable wheeled trucks--as long as they continue to fantasize about \\"marching\\" instead of mechanizing and fighting they will be stuck in WWI and WW2 beach assault re-enactments while the Army can actually do the mechanized infiltration blitzkrieg that maneuver warfare reformers like Lind define as \\"3rd Generation War\\". Now that we are actually in 4th Generation War, it behooves the USMC to get its act together so when their men and women get blown up in wheeled trucks by enemy land mines waiting for them on roads, that they don't go crazy and start killing civilians because they think landmines are something new (\\"IEDs\\") when if they spent less time beating their chests and studying warfare trends they'd have been avoiding the blast in the first place or shrugging it off with adequate armor protection. If the USMC continues to refuse to adapt, we should reduce their numbers from our pay roll and get people who want to fight correctly as adults for the right, unselfish reasons on the non-linear battlefield.

Clearly, the marines are in the &quot;not&quot; category as they tried repeatedly to move into Fallujah on foot without tracked tanks and were repulsed by heavy casualties. There is no room in 21st century warfare for hubris; marines have clearly not read and embraced Colonel MacGregor's book because they still cling to fantasies of romantic, low-grade, lemming foot-infantry on a non-linear battlefield (NLB) populated by RPGs, roadside bombs and AKMs in every household. When the marines quit beating their chests and get rid of their Stryker (LAV-1s) wheeled trucks and stop wasting our nation's amphibious ship capacity with even more trucks then they will have applied Colonel MacGregor's sage advice.<br />In contrast, in a temporary basis, the U.S. Army 1st Armored Division has successfully squeezed the opposition in Najaf without a lot of flag-draped coffins.<br />How?<br />By using lots of M1 Abrams heavy, M2 Bradley and M113 Gavin light tracked tanks to move around the NLB. The question now will the Army realize that on the NLB no one should be riding in a wheeled truck and take the necessary steps to upgrade the thousands of M113 Gavins with RPG and roadside-bomb resistant armor, gunshields it has, to achieve this quickly and at low costs, or will the Army continue to tinker with handfuls of trucks that they hide in a quiet corner of Iraq, hogging up all funds?<br />I guess this will be all covered in Colonel MacGregor's next book!	2004-05-28

The book, written by a fawning devotee of the Boyd mentality tries to put a positive spin on these men's sacrifices by distorting reality to make it appear the the u.s. marines have embraced a more truthful warfighting style when their very arrogance prevents the humility needed to see reality clearly to have a faster \\"OODA loop\\". Read his chapter on how the Mc defecated on Colonel Wyly and then ponder how all of a sudden the USMC is this embodiment of OODA loop; it doesn't compute, its a lie. The USMC without a warfighting doctrine used the '80s reformers to create an outward appearance to continue their arrogance and robotics while the reformers used the USMC to foist a lie that their half-baked ideas were being taken seriously by \\"somebody\\".<br />The central problem with Boyd and the reformers in the '80s are revealed here in this book: they accept the idea of being cocky and arrogant which is a vice not a virtue---then think you can suddenly shift gears and be this humble, honest human being who sees things for what they are in order to have a faster OODA loop. It doesn't work that way. Its this basic existentialist hubris that CREATES the senior officer jerks that the author laments in his book as the nemesis to the reformers having their way! The USMC is an organization that creates narrow-minded egotists from day 1 of basic enlisted/officer training for example, that are 99.9% more likely to become the narrow-minded dehumanizers who want to fight wars with frontal and simplistic assaults without any respect at all to what the enemy is doing BECAUSE THEY DO NOT EVEN RESPECT THEIR OWN MEN WHO HAVE LESS RANK THAN THEY. If they treat their own men like feces how can they even begin to RESPECT the enemy as a cunning, capable foe?<br />He's a undisciplined \\"raghead\\" to them.<br />I think the reformers deserve our thanks; but the best way is to pick up the torch they have dropped, reignite it properly with a sound military reform movement that is HUMBLE, HUMAN and pro-active instead of arrogant, reactive and iconoclastic, based on a COMPLETE, sound military philosophy not a fighter pilot's observation about dogfight kinetic energy levels.undisciplined \\"raghead\\" to them.<br />I think the reformers deserve our thanks; but the best way is to pick up the torch they have dropped, reignite it properly with a sound military reform movement that is HUMBLE, HUMAN and pro-active instead of arrogant, reactive and iconoclastic, based on a COMPLETE, sound military philosophy not a fighter pilot's observation about dogfight kinetic energy levels.	2002-11-30

Colonel Burton's book outlines how 1980s reformers sought to get reliable, safe and affordable weapons into U.S. military service and how these common sense efforts are opposed by the egotists with other agendas. The point is that the U.S. military culture BREEDS self-seeking, egotistical, vain milicrats not common sense warriors with values of honor and troop welfare and mission accomplishment.<br />The sad thing is that the 1980s military reformers are now gone and not on duty to stop the current round of Pentagon losers like the lav3stryker, V-22, AAAV and F-22 all stricken with the disease of Tofflerian gadgets while ignoring sound physical robustness, reliability and combat effectiveness at their own level. The current generals runnng DoD have simply transplanted their bureaucratic pass-the-buck mentality to the foot Soldier and pilot by hoping a computer \\"mouse-click\\" will deliver some magic firepower to solve the battlefield problem instead of empowering lower ranks to fight and win at their own level.<br />What makes this book so haunting is that its a true story that is repeating itself before our very eyes with the Army's thin-skinned, air-filled rubber-tired LAV-3 Stryker armored car boondoggle that will get our men killed in combat. The book shows the exact same PR tactics and lying \\"spin\\" the Army and DoD use to put people second and their programs/promotions first. The depiction of how the Army will cheat on tests to masquerade that \\"all is well\\" with a program is common as seen by the recent efforts to deceive the public by flying overweight lav3strykers a short distance by C-130 aircraft with less fuel inside to compensate--exactly how in the Bradley's fuel tanks were filled just with the minimum fuel to drive in front of the audience grandstands and to the aim point for the test anti-tank weapon to hit it.<br />The tragedy is that after 2 decades, the Army today is rushing the lav3stryker deathtrap into production without ANY live-fire testing against fully fueled and ammo loaded vehicles fired at by RPGs or 14.5mm heavy machine guns thanks to a loophole in DoD procurement. Too bad Colonel Burton wasn't on duty now in the Pentagon. When they make the movie sequel to this book, \\"Pentagon Wars II: the lav3stryker\\" it looks like the ending will not be a happy one with a better vehicle (upgraded M113A3 Gavins) going into service.

Not only do the authors survey all of the major air, land and sea weapons systems under development, they write from a context framed by the past. This makes this work exceptional in contrast to most books that gush over future gadgetry while ignoring the physical world we live in which requires platforms that are robust, durable and mobile.<br />The book details how real transformation in land combat requires splicing new technologies like hybrid-electric drives, band tracks and advanced armor and weaponry to combat proven tracked M113A3 Gavin type vehicles not expensive lav3stryker rubber-tired armored cars. The authors explain how 5 combat effective 10.5 ton tracked M113A3 Gavins can fly in a single C-17 and easily in smaller C-130 aircraft while the overweight 19-ton wheeled lav3strykers can only fly 2-3 at a time in a C-17 and stripped down of fuel/ammo inside a C-130. The authors dilligently point out that spending billions on inferior equipment and losing capabilities is not transformation---gaining capabilities by upgrading M113 Gavins into Brigade Combat Teams is the way to victory.<br />Another excellent segment of the book is its depiction of efforts to lighten the individual Soldier's load and give him greater mobility (4-25 mph) by means like folding all-terrain bikes (ATBs) and carts.

First the BAD; the authors commissioned a superb painter to render battle scenes, however for 1983 Grenada they fed him wrong information as he depicts marines running out of CH-46E helicopters wearing Kevlar helmets and M249 light machine guns when only the 82nd Airborne Division Paratroops wore the new \\"fritz\\" helmets during Operation Urgent Fury, the M249 \\"SAW\\" wasn't even in U.S. service until 1985 and it was U.S. Army Rangers who deployed from the CH-46Es to rescue the medical students at the Grand Anse campus (errors also on pages 194-195). The painting looks like a bad rip-off of Navy artist Mike Leahy's depiction of the 1983 invasion. It even has a marine firing a M72 LAW rocket with backblast ready to fry some other marines running out of the \\"frog\\" helicopter. A bunch of fantasy.<br />The GOOD is that the book does show how helicopters have been shot down/destroyed when they are unarmored like marine AH-1 Cobras were in Grenada (and still are today) or when they try to do something stupid like land in broad daylight on an enemy-held beach like marines directed USAF HH-53s to do on Koh Tang island in 1975 or when a marine pilot flew into a fuel-laden EC-130 at Desert One in 1980. The book also shows promise for the future with the AVPRO EXINT people pods which could make the useless for Close Air Support marine AV-8B Harrier II vertical take-off/landing jet (needs running take-off to carry decent bombload, burns fuel too fast to remain overhead to support friendly troops, fuel tanks and exhaust nozzles co-located, unarmored) play a vital role in downed pilot rescues---since the longer the delay, the more enemy troops converge around the man (or men) in jeopardy.<br />The book in the futures section is reminiscent of General David Grange's \\"Air-Mech-Strike\\" study group proposals since it depicts possible new rotary-wing V/STOL aircraft designs to get higher speeds like the stopped \\"X\\" rotor and canard wing.<br />If you read the book with a sharp eye to pinpoint factual errors there is more good here than there is bad to lead you astray; perhaps those that take V/STOL aircraft into combat with intelligence (not hubris) and unpredictable plans are not \\"damned\\" after all?npoint factual errors there is more good here than there is bad to lead you astray; perhaps those that take V/STOL aircraft into combat with intelligence (not hubris) and unpredictable plans are not \\"damned\\" after all?	2002-08-31

By showing this common training denominator you get the sense of what USSOCOM is about; which is infiltrating and exfiltrating by extreme means to do special missions.<br />True, LRS Units are not part of USSOCOM nor are marines, but the fact that these units exist and are quasi-&quot;special&quot; is a misunderstanding easy to forgive coming from a British writer.<br />The LRS Course is mentioned in the context of the Ranger Training Brigade which is a necessary stepping stone in the USSOCOM &quot;pipeline&quot; to being a &quot;tabbed&quot; member of the 75th Ranger Regiment. Rangers are half in the conventional Army and half in SOF, this is a convuluted reality no fault of the writer's.<br />Just look at the photos to study the gear and TTP being employed at the second the picture was taken for crying out loud!	2002-08-29

The goal of Haney's book is to honor the sacrifices and courage of these men who go unsung not to draw attention to himself, and he has succeeded in showing us the greatness of men like Walter Shumate and Charlie Beckwith. Haney will uniquely stop the entire book and list the names of the men who died during an operation on a page all by itself.<br />Like that Ranger Corporal on Grenada, Delta operative Eric Haney is saying \\"enough is enough\\" with the current hollywood video game simplistic view of war and is charging freedom's enemies with true ways to defeat them with adult professionalism; its up to us now to join him in the assault.	2002-07-11

Its currently best-seller #7 of U.S. Army West Point Military Academy Cadets at Amazon books, so this is encouraging.<br />However, its really two books, Book 1 describes a Technotactically advanced Space Paratrooper force that thinks and uses egalitarean teamwork. When most people refer to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; this is what they think of: Space Paratroopers jumping from space in capsules, re-entering the earth's atmosphere, then landing by parachute inside an armored, powered &quot;superman&quot; suit with devastating weapons, situational awareness, an ability to fly for short distances using leg jets. Basically the armored tank and the infantryman have merged into a &quot;mechanized human&quot;. We follow one recruit, Johnny Rico from basic training to combat to OCS and some more combat against sub-terranian alien bugs, impervious to stand-off, even nuclear firepower. He and his team-mates help each other out as they fight to save mankind.<br />Heinlein in amazing anticipation of events predicts:<br />1. The desirability of masses of individual Paratroopers flooding an enemy system of defense<br /> 2. The inability of firepower even nuclear to subdue enemies gone to ground, and the need to have ground forces<br /> 3. U.S. and Russia teaming up to fight Red China (?)<br /> 4. All-Volunteer Force not having enough things to do<br /> 5. Men wearing ear rings as socially acceptable<br /> 6. Women as combat pilots<br /> 7. Need for Situational Awareness means to be mind and hands-free; page 102;<br /> &quot;And that is the beauty of a powered suit: you don't have to think about it. You don't have to drive it, fly it, conn it, operate it; you just wear it and it takes orders directly from your muscles and does for you what your muscles are trying to do. This leaves you with your whole mind free to handle your weapons and notice what is going on around you...which is supremely important to an infantryman who wants to die in bed. If you load a mud foot down with a lot of gadgets that he has to watch, somebody a lot more simply equipped--say with a stone ax---will sneak up and bash his head in while he is trying to read a vernier&quot;<br />&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is the unspoken inspiration behind the U.S. Army's effort to digitalize the individual fighting Soldier called &quot;21st Century Land Warrior or &quot;21st CLAW&quot;. Heinlein if alive today would be pleased. But overall he may be alarmed that his vision is being used to complicate the fighting processes instead of simplifying them. His warning above should be heeded.<br />He also brilliantly foretells and describes a dazzling array of technologies that we actually have today from beacons to Soldier global positioning systems to night sights. He paints a picture of a &quot;Super Infantry&quot;. He clearly understands the need to &quot;force an entry&quot; by his Paratroopers (Starship Troopers) descending rapidly from space in enormous numbers with decoys and debris from their capsules creating a flood of blips on enemy radars too numerous for him to contend with. This anticipation of the essence of ballistic missile (the starship trooper in his capsule is a re-entry vehicle) defense was written by a man in the 1950s before we even had such things as satellites and sub-orbital ballistic missiles! The irony is that the very reasons Heinlein uses for describing how his &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; would be impossible to stop applies to the current National Missile Defense debate. We should in the interim develop a high-altitude mass tactical individual parachuting system with delayed opening chutes as Heinlein proposes to better avoid enemy air defenses in the 21st century. When/if space combat becomes a reality, the flood of individual re-entry capsules makes a lot more sense than packing the men into a landing spacecraft which provides a convenient target for the enemy to destroy.<br />This is the book we all love.*<br />Yet this is all BAIT.<br />Heinlein starts the book off with the attention-getting battle in the supertrooper gear to try to later on sell you on his POLITICAL AGENDA or what I call &quot;book 2&quot;. He is saying that if you like the military &quot;Mobile Infantry&quot; (MI) force presented (essentially the self-reliant, U.S. Army Airborne Paratrooper in futuristic space gear), you need to change the way the U.S. government is run to the way Heinlein sees it should be. To have mechanized humans, you must have a mechanized SOCIETY. There is no &quot;free lunch&quot; as his school professor/mentor retired MI LTC DuBois would likely tell Rico. Heinlein flat out proposes that the U.S. Constitution and its ideas of each human being having intrinsic citizenship rights in his starship future will be eliminated. Clearly, this is a subversive book that is a direct cultural attack on the Constitution of the U.S. which Heinlein as a former U.S. Navy officer was sworn once to uphold.<br />*The recent Hollywood film is a disgrace that failed to depict Heinlein's vision of space Paratroopers when we easily have the visual technology to do this and chose to instead mock the entire book with glib presentations of generations X/Y actors having sex and co-ed showers together then getting massacred by space bugs because they have no armored suits or tanks and only standard 21st Century 5.56mm assault rifles to shoot at the bugs.

Peter Stiff shows how the armies in the southern africa area SOLVED the land mine, automatic weapons fire ambush, and if we want to avoid learning the same lessons all over again at a high cost in destroyed lives, we should read and heed this book's ideas into our own Army.

A Sense of Honor is really a story of a clash of values mirrored in the lives of two sets of people (that's right two sets).<br />Combat-weary Cpt Lenahan is actually the egalitarean leader Cadet Fogarty will be when he drops the youthful arrogance/hubris, Commander Pratt is the humanity-less technocrat Cadet Dean will become if not steered towards a combat, people-oriented view of life. When Pratt and Lenahan fight over Fogarty and Dean they are really fighting over their souls, and their respective mentalities. The point is that the U.S. military, in this the case the Naval Academy, is better served by a people-centered warrior mentality with an expectaction that the hubris will drop with maturity than starting off with a people-are-machines mentality and ending up as a dehumanizing technocrat (where we are today) whose machines/computers cannot deter the cunning HUMAN enemy who is allowed to be creative, flamboyant.<br />The most damning scene is at the book's end when Lenahan goes for help from the &quot;Admiral&quot; who is supposed to be the last defender of good, solid, sound Navy values, and he demurs and almost gives him his head. I have seen and experienced this myself. This is the true warning to us, that there are no mystical group of &quot;graybeards&quot; or &quot;sea dogs&quot; who are going to risk their reputations and oppose the current military leadership if its bent on self-destruction; it is up to each one of us to keep the military on an &quot;even keel&quot; and pointed in the right direction--it may take hundreds of little battles like Lenahan fights for the souls of young men like Fogarty/Dean, but with each small victory, we prevent at least one monster like Pratt from being born.<br />Airborne!	2000-10-25

But James Webb is a &quot;straight shooter&quot; and his fiction encapsulates his observations/experiences in Vietnam. And they are indeed a negative collection of what NOT to do. Those that think Fields of Fire somehow supports and justifies the marine corps status quo tactically are just decieved, perhaps even Webb himself. I read a unit that is getting its tail kicked that has not adapted its tactics, techniques and procedures to overcome the enemy. The vanity and ethos of Lt. Hodges has nothing &quot;under the hood&quot; in his bag of tricks to defeat the enemy other than stumbling around in the jungle overloaded with gear. If Webb sees him as the epitome of military training, then its his own limitations showing. A THINKING ethos would have its leaders reading Bernard Fall, Larteguy, Mao, whatever it took to get the &quot;edge&quot; we need to win as the Hackworth of old did.<br />The beginning/ending scene when the unit is surrounded, in the dark guarding a too-heavy for Vietnam M48 tank symbolizes America's predicament--supposedly so &quot;powerful&quot; but when it comes down to it it cannot even protect itself as it got disabled by a mere land mine. The last scenes of the movie Platoon with its impending doom captures this essence of despair Webb wants you to feel. Hell yes, I'm grateful we have men willing to be there in uniform in dark situations, but I WANT THEM TO WIN, and we don't get there by business-as-usual. You get there by innovation, by THINKING by looking less in the mirror wearing dress blues and recounting family heritage and spending more time learning what makes the enemy tick, perhaps....heresy......in a LIBRARY? Or ordering a book from Amazon.com.... Then you get involved in how America designs its armored vehicles (less time at uniform balls chasing skirts) so they have a &quot;V&quot; hull shape so they can deflect a mine, have powered road wheels so they can run on a short track...make them light enough so they can go off the roads and avoid likely mines/ambushes..make them light enough so they can fly by helicopters to get into dominant positions using the Air-Mech-Strike concept in General David Grange's new book by the same name.<br />You only need to read this book once to know what NOT to do.

Brigadier Simpkin talks about the un-thinkable; what appens when a human being goes to war in an armored vehicle. This ugly truth is not talked about because in peacetime you can stop and leave the vehicle to relieve yourself...in battle you go in your pants and/or your vehicle for you will be lucky to be alive after its over to be sickened by the stench.<br />This is ridiculous as its one of the driving factors that gets vehicle crewman killed--history is filled with examples of armored crewman getting killed as they stop to rest/relieve themselves away from their vehicles, and on the around-the-clock, &quot;dirty&quot; battlefield with chemical, nuclear and biological agents leaving the vehicle for ANY reason could kill you. Simpkin conjectures why don't we build INTO the armored vehicle human factors--a way to relieve yourself in your battle position using a seat with commode features, a place to lay down and rest and eggads, a shower. He is right, but the conservative military mind which is all macho is already sensistive to criticism that mounted warriors already have life &quot;too easy&quot; and simply will not do it. I only know of the British Warrior MICV that has a troop seat/commode capability. We are not talking about never leaving the vehicle in non-contaminated environments to fight dismounted and achieve adequate security--we are talking about not turning the vehicle into a pig sty.<br />Despite this, Simpkin is right and inspires many designers to advocate that the Future Combat System (FCS) have human livability built in, and that a trailer and/or a lock-in/lock-out module on the vehicle rear with hygiene capabilities be develeoped so light foot infantry can come in and refresh or decontaminate and put on new protective clothing when their old stuff needs replacing. There is a way if we have the WILL, and reading Simpkin shows you the way, its up to us to get the WILL.<br />Airborne!	2000-10-14

These are forces that would have a combination flying aircraft and armored tank. This is still way ahead of its time as we are still struggling to get fixed and rotary-wing aircraft together with light tracked Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) as the new book Air-Mech-Strike:3-Dimensional Phalanx by Dave Grange's group quotes Simpkin heavily. Simpkin is right though, we could create a LIGHT armored personnel carrier with rubber &quot;band tracks&quot; that could fold its rotors after flight if the same turbine engine that powered flight was geared to charge electric batteries/motors for silent stealthy operation--it would be a superb scout/recon machine that wouldn't have to burn fuel constantly to remain in a hover like today's scout helicopters, but could set down on the ground and revert to a less energing demanding ground vehicle operation. The entire Air/Land Fighting Vehicle would be made out of non-metallics and be radar-invisible. We could do this if we had the WILL in America to do great things, we certainly have the know-how (TECHNOLOGY) ; we only have to look at nature to see many types of flying insects that are dual ground/air movement capable. If we were to read Simpkin's book and allow ourselves to be re-inspired perhaps we could once again lead the way with conceptual greatness again in America.<br />THE RACE BELONGS TO THE SWIFT, BRIGADIER SIMPKIN!	2000-09-30

What I like about SEAL! is that it describes how Mike Walsh went from  Vietnam painted-face, hard-living Commando to a leader of men with a sense  of discretion and valor. His maturity as a fighting leader carries the day  as he leads reconaissance missions on Grenada that did not go awary and  even standing firm on ground truth before the pressures of senior leaders,  which he did before the Panama raid on Noriega's plane at Punta Paitilla.  LTCDR Mike walsh is a great military leader and human being we should all  strive to emulate. The way he wanted to run the Punta Paitilla missions  should be &quot;SOF 101&quot; for every warrior.<br />The best scene in the  book, is the story of the SEAL who gets injured and is paralyzed. Walsh  describes the invisible drive that makes a man a Navy SEAL, and that how  when EVERYONE had counted this man &quot;out&quot;, gone from the teams  forever, that he slips from his chair into the pool and begins to swim and  while everyone is stunned, raises his arm and cries HOOOYAHH!, the SEAL war  cry. I don't do the scene justice so you are going to have to read it, but  it makes the book entirely worthwhile.<br />As the book ends, Walsh describes  boldly his change to a new set of values and he makes no hesitation to  describe how his belief in God makes him a better SEAL and human being.

Even more sadly, the whole  point of Delta was to have a specially trained and ready force to respond  to terrorist incidents and NOT resort to ad hocery-which is throwing  together unqualified units together---which is EXACTLY what was forced on  Delta when higher authorities insisted unsuitable marine pilots and navy  MINESWEEPING helicopters be used to attempt the Iran rescue mission. This  book should be read in conjunction with Colonel Jim Kyle's &quot;The Guts  to Try&quot; to get an accurate picture of the &quot;desert one&quot;  disappointment which was caused by the failings of another service which  postures as a quasi-911 force when its barely able to handle  &quot;411&quot; directory assistance calls to evacuate U.S. citizens when  the enemy permits this in order to get us out of their way of  killing/rebellion. When the enemy does the opposite we need REAL hostage  rescue forces from SFOD-D and ST 6 not &quot;extremis&quot; posturers.<br />If there is a fault to blame on Colonel Beckwith is that his plan itself  was overly complex and reliant on rotary-wing aircraft for extreme  long-range insertion/extraction when it should have been based on  parachuting men from mechanically-sound fixed-wing aircraft to get the  force into Iran, and then flying in the helicopters INSIDE fixed-wing  aircraft to get them closer to the objective and then pull them out. This  is now SOP these days with the 160th SOAR. Its too bad Colonel Arthur D.  &quot;Bull&quot; Simons (see &quot;THE RAID&quot; by Benjamin Schemmer and  &quot;On Wings of Eagle&quot; by Ken Follet) was not on active duty in a  mentorship role to insure a simple plan was employed but the arrogance of  youth mitigates against this. In a bitter irony, years after SFOD-D had  created a string of impressive victories to erase the memories of Desert  One, it was the now-deceased Beckwith who was reported not welcome at the  very command he spilled his guts for to create! Lesson learned is to  &quot;with wise counsel make war&quot;, ask the veterans for advice, don't  assume we can field a gadget plane (V-22) to make unsound concepts  &quot;fly&quot;. Read this book, and build a monument in honor of  &quot;Charging Charlie&quot; with your life lived to the fullest by daring  greatly like he did.

In this, this book is invaluable and has placed itself in its  own niche as a must-read book. What is exceptional is that Waller has  placed the Air Force special operators in the same category as the ground  grunt SOF types (SEALs, Green Berets etc) and this is fitting as it DOES  take a special kind of courage to fly in aircraft at the edge of the  envelope daily while popular perceptions do not reward you with the respect  the ground-SOF types get as being &quot;killers&quot;.

Firepower and Airborne maneuver warfare combined	For the first time the realization of Sun Tzu that there must be &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;extraordinary&quot; forces has been combined  into one concept of war instead of the endless heavy versus light, armor  versus airborne, firepower versus maneuver squabbles; or the sea-service  imposters trying to copy the WWII Nazi blitzkrieg--- we really need BOTH in  our world that moves by the AIR and increasingly communicates in the higher  regions of space. America doesn't have a properly thought-through  warfighting doctrine now, it hopes/wishes for sea and aircraft delivered  &quot;posturing&quot; to coax enemies into giving up, when such  ship-centric saber-rattling and callous bombing fails to hinder let alone  kill the enemy's ground forces but does kill innocent civilians, and drains  the national treasury with expensive million-dollar-a-shot cruise missiles.  These things have their place---but as supporting means to a decisive  warfighting capability which comes from being able to control the ground  where human beings live. Sun Tzu said &quot;what matters in war is VICTORY,  not prolonged operations, however brilliantly executed&quot;. In contrast  turning the civilian populace against you with high-altitude, stand-off  bombing and having a &quot;glass jaw&quot; that you are unwilling to put  men on the ground are the same recipes for disaster that led to the fall of  South Vietnam. The authors finally solve the riddle of Vietnam and show  that there is a better way---use Army and Air Force aircraft power to  deliver decisive ground forces that are shielded and mobile in light  armored vehicles, with high-quality infantry to collapse enemies whenever  possible; if not kill them quickly---and not civilians who are vulnerable  to 4th Generation War psychological attacks via mass media.

What is most revealing is that Foss shows that the U.K.  chose wisely to make the Scorpion/Scimitar family under 8 tons rather than  in the 15 ton category, making it HELICOPTER air-transportable, hence an  &quot;Air-Mech&quot; capability. The pay-off is that when the British Army  needed armor in the 1974 Cyprus crisis they were able to fly in Scorpions  by C-130s. When the Falklands War came, these amazing vehicle's light  weight and light tracked ground pressure allowed them to be there to render  battle-winning fire support for British Paratroopers marching across the  island.<br />By the book ending before the Kosovo crisis, Foss is unable to  mention the Scimitar family being CH-47 Chinook helicoptered into the area  avoiding mines, obstacles, road ambushes to be the first NATO forces on the  ground. Foss does with the beautiful illustrations of Peter Sarson show the  Scorpion family in action in the Gulf war where a certain bias comes  through in Foss. Foss clearly misunderstands that bigger engine and weight  translates into &quot;greater mobility&quot; (the ultra-heavy school of AFV  thought) which makes him wrongly conclude that when the Scorpion family in  the Gulf war &quot;couldn't keep up&quot; with the 60-ton Challenger  main  battle tanks that the former is obsolete. If the Challenger had been around  for the Falklands war in 1982, we could equally say, &quot;It couldn't keep  up with the Scorpion/Scimitars&quot; because it couldn't even deploy much  less traverse the soft, wet boggy terrain of the South Atlantic islands.  Foss should know that when he describes that the Scorpion family had to  make do with a petrol engine in the 60s when it was created, that the same  high-power-to-weight-ratio diesel engine technology that gives us the  Challenger can be used to upgrade the Scorpion/Scimitar family to make it  as fast as the Challengers in the open desert as they are certainly more  mobile everywhere else.<br />Its a great book, and a must have for the modern  tactical futurist because the Scorpion family has been extremely successful  despite the wishes of the heavyists--that Striker versions have killed  heavy Iraqi tanks using guided missiles points the way to the future--light  TRACKED AFVs that can go anywhere and be air-transported with top-attack  missiles, cannon and can carry infantry.

I have always been curious about the British Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle, so I bought the Foss book and began to see why the British Army  selected the Warrior over the Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV). Foss explains  that the British Army was involved with the BFV's development and didn't  like what they saw and came up with their own vehicle that is simpler and  with a lower profile.<br /><br />The Warrior has some features we could easily  incorporate into our BFVs, if we would realize its an INFANTRY fighting  vehicle not a wannabe-tank with gunnery driving training with the men in  back as security guards. In contrast, the Warrior has always had bench  seats to carry 7 men, has a low-pressure 30mm Rarden cannon so the infantry  can have their heads out the top hatches to fire/see what's going on, while  we tinkered with firing ports. What is amazing about Warrior is that it has  rotating periscopes for the infantry in the back to see what is going on  when \\"buttoned up\\" while in the BFV you are as blind as a bat.  The Warrior has a full NBC protection system and even a toilet in the  vehicle! If that were not enough Foss explains that the Warrior has a  heater for meals and coffee/tea and a large power operated rear door and  not a ramp--so the infantry in back can get themselves out quickly without  having to beg the driver to open it like we do on the BFV. The British used  CHOBHAM armor to applique to the outsides of their Warrior ICVs--this is  the same stuff used to armor main battle tanks. When a warrior was hit  accidentally by a tank gun round in the Gulf war, it glanced off doing only  minor damage. When a tank round hit a BFV in the Gulf, it demolished the  vehicle and killed/wounded the men inside.<br /><br />Reading Foss' excellent work  you wonder why we don't put a rotating periscope in the BFV on the top  troop hatch, replace the rear ramp with the large power door, put a decent  NBC over-pressure/air filtration system in, install a troop commode, and  apply REAL armor to the outsides to include the lighter M113A3s? Why not  replace the BFV turret with a low-profile one-man turret with a 30mm  autocannon using the same low-pressure ammo as the AH-64 helicopter uses  and return our BFVs to Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles--to their  original purpose as infantry transports?<br /><br />The faults of the Warrior are  that it doesn't come with Forward Looking Infared (FLIR) or cannot fire on  the move like the BFV, but must stop to shoot. This can be fixed by using a  low-profile 25-30mm turret like the Desert Warrior improved version has  that was selected by Kuwait over the BFV for its armed forces. Fire/Forget  Anti-tank missiles like the Javelin would be easily attached to the turret  outsides like the Desert Warrior has TOW ATGMs. These same things can apply  to the BFV.<br /><br />So which vehicle is better, Bradley or Warrior? Clearly they  both could be equally as good if the best aspects of each one were  integrated in the other. Both vehicles need to remove their fuel tanks from  inside the vehicle which could incinerate the men and place them in the  rear outsides like the M113A3 does. Clearly the British Warrior has more of  an infantry purpose in mind with more field craft, as the tubes for  camouflage net sticks around the vehicle facilitate. They do not curse  their infantry by permanently assigning them to vehicles where they get  lazy (or worse get assigned to a 2-man turret and become wannabe tankers  obsessed with BFV \\"gunnery\\") and lose their light infantry  skills--infantry is infantry and can be attached to helicopters or vehicles  or \\"yomp\\" on foot as required. When Foss describes the infantry  actions on foot to secure some objectives during Desert Storm, it makes you  wonder about the U.S. BFV mentality. I admire the British  tactically-oriented approach and wish we would emulate it.<br /><br />My only fault  with Foss is that he clearly misunderstands mobility issues having boughtinto the heavyist mentality that \\"bigger is better\\". Bigger is  not better if it cannot get to the battlefield---one of the reasons why the  British and U.S. Armies keep lighter AFVs like the FV 432 and M113A3  around. Foss never seens to mention/realize that the same technology that  makes a Warrior fast could also make a FV 432 fast, like the U.S. Army has  done to make the M113A3s keep up with the M1/M2s in the open  desert.<br /><br />Other than this, buy this book and compare the Warrior design to  the BFV and the Russian BMP-3 and BMD-3 (see Zaloga's works) and ponder on  British successes with their vehicle-encouraged infantry mentality and the  troubles the Russians had early on in Afghanistan and Chechnya when the  vehicle eroded infantry capabilities.into the heavyist mentality that \\"bigger is better\\".

McMaster fighting the Battle of 73 Easting described in Tom  Clancy's Armored Cav. After battling the Iraqis, both of these brilliant  tacticians went to work to better America's Army taking their experiences  of combining arms in the Cav to heart. LTC McMaster focused in his book on  the geo/domestic politics that led our nation into war in Vietnam and Col  MacGregor looks into U.S. Army force structure/design.<br />MacGregor begins  by showing that in WWII, the U.S. Army created Regimental Combat Teams  combining-arms to defeat the German mechanized armies long before the  marines (who never had to fight a mechanized 1st world enemy in WWII or  ever for that matter) created their smaller battalion-sized imitation  brand. MacGregor shows that the Regiment/Brigade size is just the right  size to combine arms (armor, infantry, artillery, engineers, aviation) as  the Division is larger and harder to fight as an entity. My only regret is  that he then proposes we get &quot;break&quot; the Divisional phalanxes to  create Brigade Combat Teams where young one-star generals can command units  fully equipped for modern warfare at all times and not assembled ad hoc.  This is not necessary since you can create BCTs within existing Divisions,  maintaining the honor/fighting traditions/identity of these legendary  formations. The idea that by making the Army smaller we will be rewarded by  the same amount of money that was for the larger force then being  transferred to new equipment---is doubtful with America's anti-military  spending mindset. Less is rewarded with less. These two assumptions have  black-listed this otherwise fine book---just read the book and keep in mind  that what he proposes can be done with existing Divisions and all will be  well. 30 BCTs are better than 26.<br />Col MacGregor then shows how we can  mix/match what the U.S. Army already has to achieve some amazing  capabilities---to show us the need he writes a Clancy-esque scenario in the  Middle east  to illustrate why reorganization is needed. His Airborne/Air  Assault force structures create possibilities of Air-Mech 3-D maneuvers  that could unhinge enemies by dislocation and support 2-D heavy force  combinations by positional advantage. His recomendations throughout the  book to move to an Army that is able to strategically deploy and be  dominant in maneuver using digital means and PGMs is the proper combination  of America's military power that stands in stark contrast to those that  just want to posture from the sea/air or even space and never take control  of the ground. He states: &quot;precision strike is a capability not a  stragey&quot;, and he is (pardon the pun) on target! Its almost prophetic  that he stated that we must be able to deploy before a foe attacks his  neighbor---just two years later we had the Serbs brutalize Kosovo and  America could not rapidly deploy combined-arms units in relevant Brigade  sizes by AIR as fast as we needed to.  His book is full of brilliant  observations of things from the obsolescence of surface amphibious ships to  the need to have forces that rapidly deploy by AIR and not take 6 months to  go by ship in an age of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Read with a  highlight pen and be ready to make marginal notes to yourself!<br />MacGregor  is a hero. He needs to be honored with the highest peacetime honor the Army  can bestow for moral courage and given any choice of assignment.

Operation Just Cause was a triumph that resulted in  Panamania dictator Manuel Noriega being captured and the PDF disarmed with  as minimum as blood shed possible. the secret was to use fast-moving  Airborne not slow-moving seaborne forces to simultaneously converge on the  enemy's centers of gravity and collapse them with light tracked armored  fighting vehicles like the superb M551 Sheridan light tank (parachute  airdropped and airlanded by USAF fixed-wing aircraft) and M113 APC could  give shielded infantry with firepower superiority at the point of contact.  This is why we had such few casualties compared to the October 3, 1993 raid  in Somalia described so eloquently in Blackhawk Down! Compare the two  battles. If we had wanted to capture Aidid like we did Noriega we should  have had light AFVs supporting our 3-D maneuver inserted  infantry.<br />Malcolm McConnell's book is so full of important details like  how Army AH-64 Apache helicopters fly in ahead and destroyed Panamania  anti-aircraft guns for the Rangers to parachute jump at 500 feet lightly  opposed.

Former marine Manchester shows that his ordeal and comrades dying were unecessary had a strategist like Gen MacArthur were  in charge of the central pacific campaigns and not the butchers in the  Navy/Mc. The message is clear: to understand war at this level requires a  lifetime of study, as MacArthur lived. As America's greatest General,  MacArthur's &quot;tri-phibious warfare&quot; bypassed and starved out major  junks of Japanese real estate and defended islands, saving thousands of  American lives, accomplishing miracles on a shoe string budget. He dropped  Paratroopers and used air smokescreens and feints. He landed in the  Japanese rear. He used deception. There was no such &quot;learning&quot;  curve in the Navy/Mc frontal attritionist blood bath driven by desires for  publicity shots to garner public support for future post-war budget battles  in Congress. If MacArthur was ego-driven, the Navy/Mc brass are fare worse  as they sent thousands of men to their graves by their failure to  understand the operational art and corrupt desire to perpetuate their own  service bureaucracy. That U.S. Army General MacArthur had to save the day  and do the Navy/Mc's job by conceiving, then staging the amphibious  envelopement at Inchon is testament to his greatness.<br />What is flat-out  disgusting is when the Navy/Mc wanted to &quot;BYPASS&quot; by invading the  rocky island of Formosa (and take gloriously heavy casalties) they wanted  TO ABANDON OUR POWS STARVING AND BEING TORTURED TO DEATH ON THE PHILIPINES.  If Nimitz had had his way, a lot of Death Camp survivors wouldn't have made  it. Fortunately, MacArthur put it all on the line and convinced otherwise  navalist FDR to keep faith with our men (includes marines that were  captured) and take the Philipines first since it was the right thing to do,  and Formosa wouldn't have mattered militarily. If we wanted to have B-29  air bases to bomb Japan, we had China and other locations to do so, losing  thousands on Formosa (now Taiwan) would have been a needless blood bath and  hollow &quot;victory&quot; for the navy/Mc PR media machine. Let's hope the  Red Chinese don't find out in the near future.<br />Be advised--this is not  so much a book about MacArthur but about his greatness evidenced by his  military campaigns and brilliant rebuilding of post-war Japan.

Clancy has to take what he's been given and make an  educated opinion of things to say what he has to say. He is wrong about the  M551 Sheridan and the BFV for example, but that's ok, he has no direct  personal experience.<br />This is a good REFERENCE book to quickly educate  whoever it is you are teaching, which includes America's Soldiers who are  still taught by rote memorization their specific tools and not the context  of the modern battlefield--Clancy expresses the heavy fight here better  than anyone so far. This is a fight with an armor versus firepower versus  mobility struggle at its core, and its equipment driven. His biggest  failing is not starting with the tracked tank in WWI and progressing  through to Vietnam and giving us the historical context of Cavalry and how  light tanks and tracked APCs in the jungles of Southeast Asia rumbled all  over the countryside and trounced the enemy with light casualties. He  avoids this controversy seeking instead to &quot;plant the seeds&quot; of a  lighter, more rapidly deployable air-cavalry by describing the M8  &quot;Buford&quot; Armored Gun System as a replacement for the M551  Sheridan light tank, and conveniently not mentioning the latter was  parachute airdropped into combat by the 3/73d Armor BN attached to the 82d  Airborne Division for Panama. He then doesn't even mention the M8 in  Airborne!, his other non-fiction U.S. Army book. This is a serious  oversight. Clearly, Clancy knows the Armored Cav he is writing about is too  heavy to rapidly deploy and he is trying to &quot;nudge&quot; it in the  right direction without the 2-D tanker-mentality realizing it will have to  fly in aircraft and parachute jump and have a negative knee-jerk reaction.  But by not describing how U.S. armored vehicles were inferior in some ways  to German tanks in WWII, Clancy fails to explain why we went overboard with  the M1/M2-M3 families, creating the not-enough armor inferiority complex  which drives many in Armor branch which has made the force too heavy to  move and irrelevent in a world that moves by air.<br />However the  &quot;silver lining&quot; in this &quot;cloud&quot;, is that Clancy  explains how the Armored Cav is a mini-combined arms team; with almost all  the elements of combat power and if he had the history covered up front  (easy to do---get Iron Chariots author Ralph Zumbro and add to the  beginning) he could have shown that this combined-arms organization came  out of WWII mechanized cavalry experiences when we had to fight for our  reconnaissance. Clancy needs to mention briefly how the 1st Cavalry  Division was once a helicopter Air Cavalry Division and what went wrong in  Vietnam and why it reverted back to a heavy formation.<br />If you pay  attention you will see that Major MacGregor was the S-3 for the Desert  Storm armored fight described--he is now Colonel Douglas MacGregor whose  book, &quot;Breaking he Phalanx&quot; enlightened the entire Army to the  benefits of combining arms on a permanent basis--its his Cavalry mentality  that is the inspiration behind the Army's current Brigade Combat Team  &quot;transformation&quot; effort. Of course, it cost Colonel MacGregor his  career for writing the book because he had a few ideas that were best not  presented.<br />This book is a best-seller; I see no reason why it couldn't  be updated with a history of mechanized cavalry to the present (pay  attention to what the 11th ACR in Vietnam did), the portions on the M551  Sheridan/M8 AGS corrected and it taking on some new ideas and present the  need for a lighter tracked AFV equipped &quot;Global Cavalry&quot; (not on  road bound armored car wheels) that would be air-transportable in BOTH USAF  fixed-wing aircraft and Army helicopters to effect decisive, 3-Dimensional  maneuver capabilities. Such a 3-D force would be the ideal compliment to a  heavier, 2-D force (not all of the force to conserve weight for strategic  lift) composed of M1/M2s. The 3-D/2-D combination would make this force the  force of choice for the 21st century.<br />Update this, book Mr.  Clancy!!!<br />Airborne!D force would be the ideal compliment to a  heavier, 2-D force (not all of the force to conserve weight for strategic  lift) composed of M1/M2s.

Don't let the size of this book fool you---the point of reading is to  understand and this is the best book I've read that puts Alexander the  Great's campaigns together in a way that military professionals and casual  readers can understand. Every war form we use today has its antecedent in  the past--there is a lot to learn from the past if we take the time to  reflect on it.<br />Warry shows some remarkable things--that Alexander's Army  of 40,000 defeated a Persian Army of 600,000 and did it with almost no  casualties because in ancient war shields defeated arrows and spears. The  Macedonian phalanx--a formation of men with shields linked together would  close on the enemy at foot speed led by Parmenio, while Alexander surged  ahead with his cavalry and collapsed his enemy while the phalanx held the  enemy. Think of how Commanders combined their arms in the film, Braveheart  to see how Alexander waited until the time was right before placing himself  and his Cavalry force at the critical spot to smash his enemy's structure.  It was when enemy cohesion and formations collapsed---when they threw down  their shields and ran---that the high casualties we usually associate with  1st Generation muscle-powered combat come from. That we are having too many  casualties on the modern, automatic weapons fire swept battlefield, means  its high time we re-examine the individual Soldier shield to recreate a  phalanx capability today.<br />When Alexander confronted the walled island  city of Tyre/Sidon he built siege engines on both ships and rolled across a  causeway of land he built by throwing stones into the sea as foretold in  the Bible in Ezekiel 26.

Have your highlight pen ready when you  examine the decisions and actions of the brave pioneers who created 3-D Air  Assault capabilities in our Army at the behest of Secretary of Defense  Robert MacNamara (he could do good things once in a while!). If you read  carefully you will see that to get the drastic Army structural changes  needed, the capabilities of helicopters were oversold--to get large numbers  of helicopters, the ground vehicle was dismissed as a tool with the  helicopter doing EVERYTHING. General Kinnard and his wizards of the 11th  Airborne Division [later reflagged the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)]  went about having helicopters do everything---place troops around the  battlefield, act as CAS gunships, fly-in artillery for fire bases--except  stay in the &quot;death ground&quot; of enemy fire (re: Colonel Bolger's  book: &quot;Death Ground: America's Infantry in battle&quot;) as an armored  shield and protected transportation means carrying superior levels of  firepower. So while Air Assault operations could &quot;run circles&quot;  around the enemy on the map board, once Sky Troopers left their mounts,  they were vulnerable to enemy fire fighting the enemy &quot;even&quot; at  best---as the more numerous enemy could absorb untold casualties without  ill effect at home. Its interesting that the  helicopter-replacing-everything hubris negated the understanding of the  need to field a helicopter-transportable light Armored Fighting Vehicle  (AFV) that could &quot;Air-Mech&quot; with Sky Troopers into battle and  give them dominance from that point on in the operation. The M551 Sheridan  light tank was available though 7 tons too heavy for the CH-47 Chinook; (I  have seen photos of it lifted by the CH-54 Sky Crane heavy lift helicopter)  why it wasn't airdropped from fixed-wing C-130 Hercules aircraft and used  for 3-D maneuver fire support by the one parachute-qualified Brigade of the  1st Cavalry Division is a mystery--the French Airborne parachuted all over  the countryside in the first Indo-China war. Perhaps it was the urgency of  getting a force that could maneuver deep into the Central Highlands of  Vietnam before the enemy cut the South into two over-rode deeper analysis  and force-on-force war games to reveal structural flaws and correct them.  America was at war.<br />As you read this superb book which should be a  companion to LTG Hal Moore/Joe Galloway's &quot;We were Soldiers once and  young&quot; account of the Ia Drang battle fought by the 1st Cav, you get a  sense that we miscalculated and were thinking &quot;big blue  arrows&quot;--operationally impressed by helicopter distance/speed 3-D  maneuver capability and overly reliant on distant artillery  howitzer/aircraft supporting arms and overlooked the up close &quot;belt  buckle&quot; fight that the enemy chose to fight whenever possible because  it would curtail our long-range fires since he had the advantage in RPG  explosives weapons effects (ready-to-fire, doesn't need to be unfolded like  a M72 LAW) while we fought him &quot;even&quot;; our M16s versus his AKMs,  our grenades versus his grenades, our bayonets versus his bayonets, our  casualties versus his numbers.<br />Today, the &quot;pendulum&quot; has swung  the other way with the helicopter Air Assault delivering foot-mobile troops  implies casualty risks and some Commanders are willing to surrender  3-Dimensional maneuver to the enemy and fight &quot;heavy&quot; only along  the 2-D axis, once again over-relying on distant supporting arms fires to  defeat the enemy (but its digitized and &quot;precision&quot; this time!)  though this means you will be channelized and ambushed in ground vehicle  restricted terrain. That aircraft (Aviation branch) could work TOGETHER  with tracked AFVs (Armor branch) to position the latter into &quot;go&quot;  terrain to overcome the enemy was possible then and certainly do-able today  with lighter AFVs like the 3-4 ton German Airborne Wiesel which can be  lifted even by the Huey's replacement, the UH-60L Blackhawk.<br />The  solution is to read this book and put yourself in the shoes of the decision  makers like a good war simulation, draw on your history and combine  Airborne and Air Assault capabilities using that magnificent air-droppable  M113 that was rumbling all over the countryside (Coleman mentions go/no-go  for tracked vehicle terrain considerations in his book), the new M551  Sheridan light tank, and combine the best attrributes of 3-D and 2-D  maneuver into one. The lesson today is to field the M8 Armored Gun System  successor to the M551 and modernize the latest M113A3, buy some Wiesels for  recon and create an Air-Mech 3-D capability in the U.S. Army today before  we fight in another place like Vietnam again. We cannot hope to chose  where/when we can fight (&quot;We don't do mountains and we don't do  jungles&quot;), living for a replay of the open desert to stampede our  heavy armored caccoons ala' Desert Storm---we must be ready to go where  America sends us. When South Vietnam was in danger of being severed by the  NVA in 1965-66 we sent the best we had: the 1st Air Cavalry Division and  they saved the day, though at a cost so high we could not sustain the  support at home for the noble endeavor.

Most other books bitterly complain  about how the British 3-D Airborne forces were dropped too far from the  bridge, or how if provided better transportation means like light armored  fighting vehicles (my view) and folding bikes, or if the 2-D forces had  been more vigorous they could have linked up, gotten to the Rhine River  bridge and the battle would have been &quot;won&quot;. But this book sets  the record straight.<br />When a portion of the British Airborne marched  towards Arnhem, they could have taken the ferry but did not (not in their  orders)and went past the railroad bridge that was blown up. Had they had  better &quot;situational awareness&quot; they could have taken and kept the  ferry. But this book goes a step further---so what?<br />The point of  penetrating into Arnhem was to get across the Rhine river and run wild in  the German industrial regions and smash war machinery and deprive the enemy  with the means to continue fighting. But to do a &quot;Sherman march&quot;  like this, these areas had to be undefended. That opportunity simply was  not there. The Germans had compressed their lines of supply/communication  and were defending in depth. So if we had kept the bridge or the ferry  across the Rhine, we would have only been stopped on the other side by the  Germans. THAT----is what is not understood by most people especially after  seeing the superb but not quite accurate film, &quot;A Bridge too Far&quot;  by Cornelius Ryan. Those that label Operation Market-Garden as a  &quot;failure&quot; fail themselves to realize that what it sought--a  collapse of the enemy from the inside---was not possible against a nation  on a desperate total war footing, so such negative labeling is unjustified.<br />I'm all in favor of Airborne units receiving light AFVs in order to  effect off-set DZ insertions, if there was a &quot;time machine&quot; I'd  go back and have Hamilcar gliders deliver Bren gun APCs and Locust  M22/Tetrarch light tanks that existed at the time. I'd have some of Gavin's  82d Airborne drop directly onto the south of Arnhem bridge to support the  British 1st Airborne driving across from the north in the Bren gun  carriers/Locust/Tetrarch light tanks. I'd had Patton temporarily in charge  of the 2-D dash up to Arnhem bridge. He'd have better, medium-sived tanks  and aPCs that could swim themselves across and not need bridges in the  first place. But at the end of the day, we'd be stopped on the far side of  the bridge or the river bank by the Germans, a 50 mile penetration,  definately worth doing, but a STRATEGIC AIM of driving unhindered into  Germany to collapse their infrastructure was not possible at that time.  This book explains this like no other work, and places it in a must-read  category--if you don't read it you simply will not understand the battle  and will be subject to the cliches' and labeling. When you understand this,  you will remove your disappointment in the leaders at that time for not  pursuing further. The truth is XXX Corps could have punched its way through  to Arnhem bridge but the Commanders knew that there was no strategic vaccum  behind it to exploit that would justify the human costs.

Until Major Mark  Adkin's book came out (Urgent Fury: the invasion of Grenada), this was THE  best reference on a short battle that was the turning point in the Cold  War. While the U.S. military likes to take its time going to war to set up  neat, Clausewitzian set-piece battles, the world was being engulfed by wars  of &quot;revolution&quot; backed by Soviet/Cuban communist advisors, funds  and armaments--when Grenada began to collapse into anarchy, Presiden Reagen  decided to go as we are and &quot;jump and take our lumps&quot;. This fine  little book depicts the hasty preparations needed to fight modern no-notice  wars and the fantastic flexibility and resolve inherent in America's elite  Airborne/Rangers to change from airlanding to parachute airdrop while in  flight en route when the runway was discovered to be blocked. The USAF  Combat Talon pilot in charge also thought quickly, saw that Cuban  anti-aircraft guns could not depress far enough and led the other C-130  Hercules down to 500 feet or below so the Rangers and two 82d Airborne  Combat Engineers could jump and secure the Point Salines runway/airfield.  Its too bad Hollywood didn't pick up this book and READ before making such  atrocious depictions like &quot;Heartbreak Ridge&quot; when U.S. Army  Rangers lead the way, fighting, dying and rescuing the hostages not any  marines who up north landed unopposed.  Maybe someday a REAL film depiction  of Urgent Fury will be produced, the men who performed the mission  certainly deserve it.<br />The &quot;center of gravity&quot; was the 10,000  foot runway under construction at Point Salines which would be used to land  Soviet transport planes loaded with armaments as a way station to latin  America to arm the &quot;revolution&quot; there. The Cubans in charge of  the defenses miscalculated as the authors showed and dug-in on the beaches  awaiting a seaborne assault by marines, which never came as we wisely  avoided a public confidence-defeating frontal attack bloodbath and dropped  in from the sky by parachutes using Airborne forces. American audacity  carried the day, as the runway was cleared and began to accept C-141B  Starlifter transports full of ragtop-helmet camouflaged Paratroopers of the  82d Airborne who together with the Rangers rescued the American medical  students, captured the Soviet arms and ammunition and swept north to link  up with the marines, securing the island. The victory on Grenada signaled  that the &quot;Reagen doctrine&quot; of rolling back communism had teeth  and America had the will to put men on the ground to stop evil from  over-running the planet. The victory we enjoy in the Cold War began those  dark days of October in 1983.<br />The authors of this fine book have  illustrated these events with numerous pictures and color plates by Paul  Hannon showing the equipment and uniforms of the combatants. What's good  for the military professional is that each illustration is scrutinized for  important details--from the beret-clad Paratrooper scout who used tape  patterns to camouflage his M16 rifle to the STABO extraction harness worm  as load bearing gear on the SFOD-Delta trooper. You can pick up insights on  how to bind prisoners all the way to gain an appreciation of tactics--don't  attack gun positions with helicopters using TOW missiles that require  steady guidance or else you might get shot down like the two marine Cobras  were,  always carry anti-tank weapons to incinerate not just deflate the  tires of enemy armored cars (Rangers brought 90mm Recoilless rifles for  this, SEAL Tm 6 didn't for the Sir Paul Scoon recovery mission).<br />This is  a must-have reference book for the student of modern warfare.<br />Airborne!iting a seaborne assault by marines, which never came as we wisely  avoided a public confidence-defeating frontal attack bloodbath and dropped  in from the sky by parachutes using Airborne forces.

The simple logic is that if the Airborne had not  employed 3-D maneuver and dropped ahead of the sealanding forces, the Nazi  Herman Goering Division would have swept the beaches clear; a mechanized  1st world Army threat the marines or Army troops in the Pacific never had  to fear from the Japanese who only had thinly armored light tanks to  contend with. Its funny how thousands of dead marine bodies in the surf at  Tarawa after a mindless frontal assault is &quot;valor&quot; and a few  hundred Army Paratroopers dispersed by winds on Sicily constitutes a  &quot;failure&quot;. At least these men didn't end up as a tragic KIA  message to loved ones, but brought the fight to the enemy. The winds  dispersing General Ridgway's Paratroopers actually helped; these forces  were able as Breuer details--to stop German counter-attacks from reaching  the beaches. On the modern, automatic weapons-swept battlefield dispersal  is a virtue, it just takes resiliant, self-reliant men to fight this way;  training to be mindless robots will not prevail in such conditions.<br />What  is especially useful is that the author shows how then Colonel  James M.  Gavin insisted on parachute dropping 75mm pack howitzers and not 60mm  mortars---this technotactical gut-level decision resulted in him being just  able to stop German heavy Tiger tanks on Biazza Ridge and saving the day.  Gavin's incredible on-the-spot presence of mind and leadership seeing the  essence of the situation and rallying the Paratroops was born that day at  Biazza Ridge. From that point on, Gavin fought long and hard to get  adequate anti-tank weapons and their own armored fighting vehicles for his  beloved Airborne troops. Breuer also describes how Gavin dispatched Major  Ireland back to the beaches to get naval gunfire support, and how he used a  bicycle to get there in time.<br />After the beaches were consolidated, the  Paratroopers of the 82d Airborne were then sent ahead of the main body as  elite shock troops/spearheads and marched rapidly across the island using  bikes, carts and even horses/donkeys. This pattern has held true to the  present---whereas the Airborne &quot;opens the door&quot; for larger forces  to enter, they usually stay and continue to lead the way as infantry. Its  logical that they be properly equipped with light AFVs like the Russian  Airborne has in order to do this with more speed/firepower and less  casualties. This book if actually read and comprehended proves that those  who condemn the American Airborne at Sicily are biased and ignorant of the  facts of their triumph. This book would make a good start point for a  script for a Saving Private Ryan-type film.<br />As jump procedures  (Pathfinders to mark Drop Zones), equipment (bazooka rocket launchers,  jeeps with 57mm anti-tank guns) improved, the Airborne became a &quot;fire  Brigade/Division&quot; saving the day in Italy against a mechanized German  Army unlike anything ever faced in the Pacific. In France, and across the  long marches to Germany, the American Airborne acted as the 3-D maneuvering  spearheads opening the doors for heavier 2-D armored forces to drive  &quot;on to Berlin&quot; as General Gavin details in the book by that name.

I would have English describe  infantry to about the Vietnam era and have Col Dan Bolger take the coverage  from there to the future in his own book Death Ground: American infantry in  battle. Bruce Gudmundsson was attached to the updated English book to  attempt to bring the work up to date.<br />Taking the masterpiece for what it  is, it delivers an important lesson mechanized maneuverists do not want to  realize---that the German &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; died in the forests and  cities of Russian when it met infantry that would not crumble if surrounded  or cut-off from comfortable supply lines. Using a defense-in-depth, a  nation on a total war footing can absorb and defeat another less committed  nation that hopes to use a smaller force to penetrate and collapse. Many,  maybe even most people mistake the German defeat in Russia--and hence  WWII---with the cold Russian winter, and this is incorrect. The next  critical---perhaps most important lesson and contribution English makes to  the defense of freedom is---that a mechanized &quot;combined arms&quot;  unit is ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS INFANTRY. When terrain and weather go sour,  artillery and tanks will reach a point where they cannot contribute--and  the entire battle then falls on the infantry. When this took place in  Russia--the German infantry was NOT up to the task with inadequate numbers,  clothing and bolt-action rifles. English points out and lesser historians  should take note--that the German war machine was good together but not  really that good because its PARTS were weak. When combined-arms  technotactics could not be employed in the forests of Russia, the battle  rested on the German infantry and it failed.<br />The cryptic lesson here is  that we need GOOD infantry in large numbers and we don't get it by placing  them into the back of armored vehicles in less than squad sizes, shut off  from what's going on because they can't open a hatch out and see because we  put a turret on the vehicle and we are afraid it will rotate into them. The  Army made this mistake with the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, is trying to  correct it with its vehicle for the new Brigade Combat Teams while the  marines are about to repeat the error with a huge autocannon turret on  their next generation amphibious assault vehicle. The second lesson of  English is still being ignored---those that do mechanized combined arms  don't value infantry action---they ride too long in their vehicles and get  ambushed by missiles and RPGs fired from enemies hiding in key terrain that  should have been taken first by the infantry. To do this you need a large  amount of aggressive, not complacent infantry. As the Russians found out in  Grozny, when their armored vehicles became flaming coffins, the battle then  falls on the infantry to clear out enemies hiding in urban terrain.<br />This  is not to say English believes in a &quot;Super Infantry&quot; since we saw  in Mogadishu  the best light infantry in the world get shot up because it  was without armored fighting vehicles to shield it from enemy fire. What  English is saying is that we should start with quality infantry when  building forces and not in the process of creating combined-arms  organizations ruin the infantry capability by reducing numbers, battle  awareness and use as a separate maneuver element.<br />On Infantry should be  required reading for ALL U.S. military personnel coupled with Bolger's  Death Ground. I'd like to see the book updated to the present with a fresh  perspective for the 21st Century where we apply English's lessons to the  future battlefield.om what's going on because they can't open a hatch out and see because we  put a turret on the vehicle and we are afraid it will rotate into them.

What Col Taylor's book does is priceless--it describes the  &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; in Desert Storm better than any other book.  Now I will explain why.<br />To the serious student of warfare Taylor explains  candidly why the 101st has been left out of Small Scale Contingency  operations like Panama because its helicopters use up too much fuel and  cannot fly far and fast enough to get there compared to the 82d Airborne  Division which airdrops from fixed-wing USAF aircraft. The 101st's  helicopters have to be disassembled and placed inside USAF fixed-wing  aircraft or shrink-wrapped and placed on slow-moving ships to &quot;get  there&quot;. For a good comparison of the pros/cons of America's infantry,  I highly recommend Col Dan Bolger's Death Ground: America's Infantry in  battle, which echoes Taylor's observations. The Division, tired of being  &quot;orphaned&quot; went on a strategic lift diet and cut out as many  ground vehicles as possible to speed their mobilization. This is not some  remote experience---the problem of getting U.S. Army forces with 3-D  maneuver capabilities to the battlefield are as current as TF Hawk's woes  were in Albania. For Desert Storm, the crafty planners at Fort Campbell  were ready, and their foresight resulted in their AH-64A Apaches leading  the way for the entire war by destroying key Iraqi radars. We need to  employ the same thinking-ahead mentality today.<br />The next learning point  for the war student is the fuel logistics---this may be boring to a reader  wanting a RAMBO story, but this demanded that a ground supply line of  trucks be used to link-up with the 101st as it bounded forward into  operating bases deep into Iraq. If you read this book for the details and  to see how the leaders overcame the obstacles of fuel, weather and terrain  to position themselves at the &quot;back door&quot; of the Iraqi retreat  you would be reinspired to the creativity and humanity of the men in this  great Division. What strikes up at you when you read this book is that once  at Highway 9, the 101st lacked enough mobile infantry to keep that route  closed to enemy escape, the tactic chosen was to use Apache gunships flying  free to detect/attack from stand-offs targets of opportunity as the  infantry basically secured the fuel dumps for the attack helicopters. With  the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, its clear that had the &quot;Screaming  Eagle&quot; Infantry been equipped with light Armored Fighting Vehicles  like the German Airborne's Wiesels, massive amounts of fuel to use  helicopters randomly could have been avoided by using this now mobile,  &quot;Air-Mech&quot; infantry to deliberately/precisely close the ground  routes out of Kuwait from the Iraqi Army. The third and &quot;achilles  heel&quot; of the 101st is its foot-mobile-constrained infantry; and for  this problem, the leaders came up short in Desert Storm because to fix it  requires a new type of ground vehicle to be obtained as the Russian  Airborne figured out long ago.<br />Overall, this book is entertaining and a  very important document since it details procedures like how 2 HMMWVs were  loaded INSIDE a CH-47D Chinook helicopter to effect more fuel-efficient and  speedy travel. That these HMMWVs were not used as infantry carriers as a  sort of &quot;rat patrol&quot;, creating an &quot;Air-Motorized&quot; force  is a question but one that is easily answered as noone wanted to take any  risks on the ground withunarmored vehicles that may get Americans killed,  though Army SOF did it to hunt for SCUD missiles farther west behind Iraqi  lines. This makes it all the more important that the 101st acquire a small  UH-60L helicopter-transportable AFV immediately so the next time we need  &quot;lightning&quot; the voltage doesn't fizzle when it touches the  ground.unarmored vehicles that may get Americans killed,  though Army SOF did it to hunt for SCUD missiles farther west behind Iraqi  lines.

The greatest contribution Mr. Zaloga makes is how he has stayed on top of the developments of the Russian Airborne's unique 8-ton BMD family of  Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) which have kneeling landing gear to better  fit inside fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. As he and David Glantz (refer to  his book on the Russian Airborne) detail, the Russian Airborne is seen as  the decisive ground maneuver &quot;knock-out&quot; punch of an Airborne  Warfare strategy that uses air and missile strikes using what we call today  &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; (WMD) to stun the west before  airdropping entire Airborne Divisions with BMD AFVs to fully protect them  and give armored mobility/firepower. To the Russians, WMD does not cause  them to give up on ground maneuver as &quot;deep strike&quot; and &quot;air  power&quot; theorists in the west assume.<br />Zaloga shows how the BMD can  transport a Squad of Paratroopers under complete armored protection with  tracked x-country mobility, solving the Paratrooper is lightly-equipped  handicap we SAY is unsolvable in the west. That we could easily have  developed our own fantastic, light tracked M113s into Airborne Combat  Vehicles with turreted autocannon and ATGM firepower shows how more  advanced the Russian Airborne is than the Airbornes in the west. The  Russian Airborne is an Air-Mech force that can 3-D maneuver into positions  of strategic advantage, then continue maneuvering 2-D with armored tracked  mobility and firepower. If that were not enough, once VDV Paratroopers  dismount their BMDs, they have legendary lightfighter skills as combat in  Afghanistan proved and documented by Zaloga and many others like Les Grau.<br />Zaloga is THE expert when it comes to the BMD family as he was the  first to report on the BMD-3 variant to the rest of the world, and its  unique airdrop all occupants inside feature using specially padded seats.  O, what we could do in the west with such an Air-Mech 3-D force with  digitized situational awareness and not the oversized, too-heavy for  helicopters road-bound armored cars we seem infatuated with! Consider that  if the Russians were on our side for Desert Storm in 1991, they could have  parachute air-dropped an entire Airborne Air-Mech Division behind Iraqi  lines without any fear of Iraqi tanks overwhelming Paratroopers on foot.  Russian Paratroopers in their lethal BMD-2s would have mauled the  Republican Guard and not let any of these forces escape as they were able  to elude U.S. forces air-inserted but foot-mobile from that point on.

We need to realize  what is it that we want to learn from Army Ranger history other than the  predictable HOOAH! stuff?<br />LTC Lock in his book reveals an aspect of  light infantry operations we simply do not understand today with our men  turned into pack mules with &quot;100 pounds of lightweight  equipment&quot;. Read his accounts of Roger's Rangers and you will see a  light infantry that could &quot;fly&quot; on its feet through the woods and  outfight the Indians. The recent film, &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;  best captures this capability. This was a Ranger infantry that was willing  to use unusual mobility means, also---boats, ice skates, snow shoes, living  off the land--all to get that mobility edge over the enemy. In WWII, Darby  used speed-marches and carts to carry mortars/ammo to close on enemies  rapidly to gain surprise/violence of action. Merrill's Marauders used mules  to carry 75mm pack howitzers and supplies to penetrate deep into the  jungles of Burma and take Myitkyina airfield from the jungle-seasoned  Japanese. In Five major (WALAWBUM, SHADUZUP, INKANGAHTAWNG, NHPUM GA, &amp;  MYITKYINA) and thirty minor engagements, they defeated the veteran soldiers  of the Japanese 18th Division (Conquerors of Singapore and Malaya) who  vastly outnumbered the Marauders. Always moving to the rear of the main  forces of the Japanese, the Marauders completely disrupted the enemy supply  and communication lines, and climaxed their behind the lines operations  with the capture of Myitkyina Airfield, the only all-weather airfield in  Northern Burma.<br />Theese lessons need to be applied to today's light  infantry that is still over-looking the capability modern mountain bikes  and carts with oversized tires could give an Airborne Ranger-type force to  close on an enemy after insertion out of detection range by  parachute/airlanding aircraft.<br />My only fault with the book is that it  doesn't clearly lay-out the roles/missions dilemma current Ranger infantry  is in---it really has 2 types of missions:<br />1.) on one hand its America's  shock troops storming defended high-value targets alone or as a spearhead  for other troops (WWII Commando mindset),<br />2.)on the other, it has to be  able to &quot;Range&quot; across the land as light infantry for days at a  time to raid/recon (traditional Ranger missions).<br />These two missions are  different and require different mindsets and equipment---and this is why TF  Ranger in Somalia did not have armored fighting vehicles--because it was  not seen as appropriate for &quot;Rangers to do mech&quot; if one was  defining the unit by traditional roles/missions. However, shock troops need  shock action and that means Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) and shielded  men, which Rangers lead the U.S. military by employing for the first time  rifle-caliber resstant body armor and having the physical conditioning and  willingness to take Soldier's load risks to go into battle with it. AFVs  are not popular in the minds of some Rangers, but its necessary to  successfully perform shock action missions in urbanized terrain. Other  elite units in the world can ride AFVs without their image suffering.  Walking is not always the best way to &quot;range&quot; across the  battlefield, as Ranger gun-jeeps, RSOVs (Land Rovers) and HMMWVs attest  from combat in Iran (Desert 1), Grenada (airlanded from C-130s), Panama  (parachute air-dropped) and Iraq (Desert Storm). But these are unarmored  vehicles not up to the task of advancing in the face of concentrated  enemies and their fire. LTC Lock in his superb chapter on the Mogadishu  raid expertly outlines why Rangers should have had armored vehicles and  that they would have prevented 1-18 men dying that day. His Somalia chapter  is as good as Bowden's entire book, &quot;Blackhawk Down!&quot; and in some  ways better---because it doesn't mince words and gets to the point that  AFVs were needed in the force structure.<br />If America's light infantry  forces would look back via LTC Lock's fine book into its methodology of  Roger's Rangers; it will find the mindset needed to make it the most mobile  and hardest-hitting infantry on earth that can range across the terrain  quick enough to defeat the stalemate sensors and optics will create against  a slower moving force. If these forces will understand that as Col Daniel  Bolger states in Death Ground: America's Infantry in battle: &quot;Ranger  tabs don't stop bullets&quot;, and accept a modest number of air-droppable  and helicopter transportable light tracked AFVs into its force structure  for its own organic shielded mobility and heavy firepower, it will have  learned well from its Somalian ordeals and be ready to lead the way! into  the 21st century.ood as Bowden's entire book, &quot;Blackhawk Down!&quot; and in some  ways better---because it doesn't mince words and gets to the point that  AFVs were needed in the force structure.<br />If America's light infantry  forces would look back via LTC Lock's fine book into its methodology of  Roger's Rangers; it will find the mindset needed to make it the most mobile  and hardest-hitting infantry on earth that can range across the terrain  quick enough to defeat the stalemate sensors and optics will create against  a slower moving force.

At the time of the book, the West was beginning  to resurge against communist expansion and NATO Airborne troops played the  critical role in winning the Cold War beginning in Grenada in 1983.<br />Weeks  shows how parachute operations by the Germans were hindered by their  parachute's inability to be steered and the small opening of their JU52  aircraft which limited them to only jumping with pistols and grenades,  their main weapons were dropped by separate containers. A lot of the  fatalism attached to Parachute assaults comes from this handicap the  Germans had to overcome on the still successful taking of the island of  Crete. They used containers with wheels that could be towed as carts.  Allied Airborne forces had better parachutes and larger jump doors and  their Airborne Soldiers jumped ready to fight with all their equipment--a  practice that continues to this day.<br />The author, a British Para officer  explains the major Airborne events leading up to the early 1980s and how  the equipment of the modern Airborne Soldier has improved steadily such  that old assumptions of the difficulties should be rethought. Reading Weeks  you are challenged to write the next chapter in Airborne history and create  fully mobile maneuver forces after 3-D maneuver inserted into the  battlefield. He notes that helicopter-mobile units are 3-D capable  continuously but are difficult to get to the battlefield quickly like  Airborne units flying from fixed-wing jets can. To somehow combine the two  capabilities would be the culmination of the Airborne deal, and something  within our grasp.	2000-08-13

This first-hand account begs the ultimate question facing us today:<br />What  if we hadn't flown in the so-called &quot;unprepared and un-equipped Army  troops from Japan to hold the Pusan perimeter? What if the ports were  mined, our ships blocked by fast patrol boats and thousands of miles away?  What if we had waited for ships to arrive?<br />The answer is the North  Koreans would have over-ran the South and the U.S. would have accepted this  as fait accompli. Look what we did when the Chinese Communists ran the  Nationalist Chinese off to the island of Taiwan a few years earlier in  1949.<br />Today, this is why we have a U.S. Army 2d Infantry Division and an  8th Army Headquarters on the ground in Korea today--so America is not  interdicted and forced to &quot;cut and run&quot; either strategically or  on the battlefield where BOTH Soldiers and marines oriented to fighting a  linear war had to retreat or else be encircled and annihilated by superior  numbers of enemy swarming across rugged mountain/hill terrain. Today, we  will stand at fight, just like the gallant men of the first Korean War did.  South Korea would have been lost to Communism had it not been for U.S. Army  Soldiers like Addison Terry &quot;going as is when he was called&quot;. It  was men like him who then held the Pusan perimeter for weeks so we could  assemble the ships together to do General MacArthur's Inchon maneuver  warfare masterpiece, cutting off the enemy deep in their own rear and  retaking he capital of Seoul. However, we will not have weeks and months  again in the future to do this amphibious stunt again.<br />The lesson of this  book is that we have to have AIR-delivered U.S. Army forces ready NOW to  fly to the aid of U.S. Army and AF forces already on the ground  &quot;holding the perimeter&quot;--let's not lose sight of the fact that  these kinds of forces saved the day in Korea long ago, as unready as would  have like them to be in favor of allegedly better forces that cannot get  there at all or in time in a world that moves by the speed of the air where  surface ship wakes are seen from space and targeted by mines, missiles,  patrol boats and modern diesel-electric &quot;ultra stealthy&quot;  submarines.<br />The nemy thought in 1950, that he could &quot;smash and  grab&quot; South Korea before we could get men on the ground to stop him.

Refer to William Manchester--a WWII marine combat vet----&quot;American  Caesar&quot;---he WAS THERE. He was shot at. He saw his buddies killed by  navalist frontal assaults conceived by amateurs in search for a future  budgetary public relations position. That he concludes that MacArthur's  campaigns in the Pacific were brilliant demand that his thinking be taken  with more weight than these arm-chair wonks. The authors (one a former  marine reservist) want to obscure the fact that the Germans were the main  threat and most difficult foe--to overcome them the U.S. Army--and its Army  Air Force not their favored navalist and marines---reformed themselves into  the greatest Air/Ground fighting forces ever assembled to that point. A  force that used both firepower and maneuver. That this force pulled off the  greatest amphibious-airborne operation in history without need of any  specialized marine ground troops must be something the authors cannot face.  A key element was the 3-D operational maneuver of parachute and glider  Paratroopers who sealed off the invasion beaches from  counter-attack--operational art foreign to the WWII navalist mind. The  Army/AF in the ETO fought and defeated the most capable 1st world country  foe in the Germans---who fielded over 100 Divisions just for the invasion  of Russia. The U.S. Army fielded over 50 Divisions in WWII to do the lion's  share of the fighting and dying in BOTH the Pacific (more efficiently for  more territory), North Africa and Europe while the navalists lied and  re-wrote history to try to hog up the credit, which is why we still have  obsolete surface-ship based land forces that are deployed in penny packets  to act as evacuation services for the State department while the majority  of the other 172,000 are in the U.S. land-locked but busy at the bars and  www telling tall tales.<br />Noone who has an objective view of history can  endorse this travesty of history, done at a time when thousands of WWII  veterans are dying each day and are thus unable to set this  wannabe-historians straight as to the way it really was.<br />May the  ghosts of WWII dead stand to correct this revisionism!ed land forces that are deployed in penny packets  to act as evacuation services for the State department while the majority  of the other 172,000 are in the U.S. land-locked but busy at the bars and  www telling tall tales.<br />Noone who has an objective view of history can  endorse this travesty of history, done at a time when thousands of WWII  veterans are dying each day and are thus unable to set this  wannabe-historians straight as to the way it really was.<br />May the  ghosts of WWII dead stand to correct this revisionism!	2000-08-12

Iwo Jima was not needed as a naval or an air base, yet the frontal assault  butchers of the Navy/Mc needed the island to justify their existance in  future budget battles. Our reward today is a multi-billion dollar obsolete  surface ship-taxi service to evacuate citizens for the State Department  when our sea and air-based posturing fails to bluff opponents into  surrender. We forget it took a nuclear weapon from a B-29 to  &quot;bluff&quot; Japan into surrender after we took Tinian in another  flag-draped coffin bloody Navy/Mc assault. Its grotesque to praise this  battle using the glory and blood of men who with better Generalship (refer  to WWII Combat vet William Machester's American Caeser) these men would BE  ALIVE TODAY.<br />If we had better Generals/Admirals, we could have pushed  through into China sooner rather than having our Flying Tigers (later 14th  AF) and Merrill's Marauders live on shoestring supplies under highly  skilled Generals Slim, Stillwell and Chennault. Then, once supply lines  were secured we could have flown all the B-29s we wanted to over Japan to  firebomb civilians and eventually drop the nukes. But there would have been  no role/mission for the Navy/Mc so we spread our resources and watched  thousands die assaulting Japanese bunkers, hiding in caves just to give a  bureaucracy something to do and later on use as a PR ploy to distort and  weaken the national defense policies of the U.S. That we were unready for  Korea should come as no surprise--we look at the flag-raising on Mount  Suribachi and assume all ground-based combat will be equally bloody so we  decide we will rely on aircraft and bombs to fight wars and hold ground. A  bad symbol of futility and defeatism connected to ground combat veiled with  outward praise of courage/honor. Well, it doesn't work. And its not  necessary.

On Killing, is in the top 10 books one must have to understand the world today--its importance is based on the realization of man's duality--he is indeed a killer and an angel. The book by this name, by Mark Schaara is  highly recommended as Col Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain considered the  paradox during the Civil War 1861-65. This paradox is also at the heart of  why some oppose what LTC Grossman has stated. Those that are angered by the  reality that man is part being that wants to live in peace and doesn't want  to shoot----love war and its illusions of proving manhood/self-worth far  too much and have not dug deep enough into their own hearts. Those that are  relieved from the guilt of killing need to be more shrewd because if we do  not learn to kill better in the world we live in, there are  &quot;killers&quot; without any consciences at all who will destroy  everything that is good.<br />But this is the black/white duality that most  people reflect on when they read this book--------<br />...the thing that is  most amazing about his book is it proves there is also another gray  duality--a far more sinister one than kill (Fight) or not to kill  (Surrender). And this is the other 2 options available in a fight---to  posture or to flee. Of these, POSTURING is the most deadly. At the  technotactical level of war, its the Soldier or marine firing wildly on  full automatic or 3 round burst without aiming....or just firing to be seen  as following orders as a good robot. Sometimes the noise and yelling  (SLAM's cross-talking) can bluff the enemy into surrender--especially if  you reach his trenchline or are already in his rear areas (maneuverism).  Martin van Crevald writes of why weapons are painted and given  &quot;shark's teeth&quot; in Technology and War---to sometimes scare an  enemy into giving up because actual war fighting is too costly. This is a  very good thing as Sun Tzu concludes in The Art of War--to a point. In the  early age of gunpowder sieges, could be decided by engineers like Vauban  determining the number of days bombardment a walled city could endure,  sending a written memo to the fort and negotiating a surrender without  bloodshed. But posturing is held up by the few actual fighting Soldiers who  get up, advance against enemy fire and hit/kill the enemy with their fire  and grenades. Or in the case of the siege, the number of actual artillery  pieces that can damage the city's walls. The danger is that a force based  on just loud-posturing will be detached from yielding tangible killing  effects on the battlefield (believing their own recruiting slogans and  distorted histories written by biased staff historians who want to stay  employed) and when faced with the actual killing fire of the enemy does not  gain fire superiority but is pinned down. In other words for posturing to  work, the threat has to be real--if the enemy finds out you are incapable  of actually fighting; your entire society is at risk.<br />Posturing taken to  the Geostrategic level---the macro scale---is clearly evident with LTC  Grossman's distance-to-killing graph---the farther away you are the easier  it is to use a weapon to kill. If we become a nation of posturers unwilling  to put men on the ground effectively; we end up with stand-off aircraft  strikes with token landing parties off-shore in surface ships as a form of  Geostrategic posturing--to make a lot of noise, not actually kill or  destroy the enemy but far too often lots of civilians and landscape. In  fact, this is exactly what has taken place in the aftermath of WWII's heavy  casualties from ground combat against automatic weapons fire. The U.S. had  decided to be neither angel nor killer but to become a geostrategic  posturer, and this &quot;bluff&quot; has been called on us already in Korea  and Vietnam. In the former, we stood firm, in the later we &quot;cut and  run&quot; because when our air/sea supremacy was faced with the onslaught  of NVA ground troops in 1975, we had nothing on the ground to stop them.  Whereas our politicians may want multi-billion dollar geostrategic  posturing via low-risk airstrikes from robot planes and marines in handfuls  (built-in excuse not to have to fight) off-shore waving flags ready to  evacuate citizens if their posturing fails, it leaves the U.S. in a  dangerous position without an actual war-winning U.S. Army properly  resourced to win the close fight where the resistance to killing is  greatest (especially among the West where we value human life) but can be  done with least cost to the civilians and countryside. The enemies out  there do not share our high values of human life. LTC Grossman describes  the lack of morality inherent in developing stand-off war forms but doesn't  quite connect the implications of what he has proven all the way to the  national level. Its not just that being able to bomb at 15,000 feet gives  civilian leaders &quot;itchy fingers&quot; or that watching murder on TV or  on a videogame vicariously makes the populace desensitized and more likely  to go &quot;postal&quot;. The real danger is that the safety mechanisms of  our society--the police and the military will be unable to do their jobs  because they were sabotaged by make-believe posturing policies and  budgetary decisions of those in love with push-button, video game warfare.  Wasting billions on pseudo-weapons with greater and greater stand-off  ranges because we are most comfortable psychologically with them prevents  the military/police from protecting us from enemies internally and  externally UP CLOSE. The term today is &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot;; an  enemy pitting his strength at our weakness. This is what makes POSTURING so  dangerous....75, we had nothing on the ground to stop them.

The term today is &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot;; an  enemy pitting his strength at our weakness. This is what makes POSTURING so  dangerous....	2000-08-12

However Men-Against-Fire  (MAF) is his most controversial and led to his near destruction as an  authority a few years back by revisonists jealous of his life's body of  work and unwilling to let their macho image of the American marine or  Soldier suffer any scrutiny. Its tragic that SLAM was actually there and  most of these revisionists were not; and it all hinges on his statement of  truth that in modern automatic weapons swept battlefields MOST MEN DO NOT  FIRE their weapons. How can they? The minute they take aim, they are hit by  enemy fire, injured and killed. Instead of dismissing SLAM like most can do  to his &quot;Soldier's Load&quot;, read &quot;Blackhawk Down!&quot; and  mark every time a Ranger or a Soldier is hit by unshielded enemy fire that  reaches out and damages the minute the bullet can fly to impact. Do this,  and you will see that its not a &quot;slam&quot; (pardon the pun) on the  American Soldier its a reality of the &quot;death ground&quot; (re: Col Dan  Bolger's book by the same name) that we have yet to solve at the dawn of  the 21st century. How important is this book?<br />We lost the war effort  (notice I chose my words carefully) in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia because  of our poor ability to overcome enemy fire resulting in casualties which  resulted in the American public/policy makers &quot;throwing the towel  in&quot; amplified by media images. This is 4th Generation warfare; welcome  to the modern era!<br />The premise of SLAM's book written in a state of  WWII and Cold War urgency is that in the face of enemy fire SOME MEN WILL  BE PINNED DOWN BY IT. Those that are not need to know this (cross-talk) and  using terrain masking, IMTs and fire/maneuver tactics advance on the enemy  and defeat the enemy to relieve pressure on the unit in trouble. To  condition men to fire when threats appear, SLAM helped introduce the  &quot;TRAIN FIRE&quot; concept of pop-up targets that teach Soldiers in the  U.S. Army to even in a state of fear the thing to do is to FIGHT and FIRE  to knock the threat down. This is why the Army uses pop-up targets in rapid  fire succession and not the slow, predictable known distance range firing  that marines think is all the rave because their last targets are a bit  farther out. We are not training to fight from WWI trenches, or at least we  shouldn't be if we are using our time right. In Somalia on October 3, 1993,  the rapid fire capability of U.S. Army Soldiers was all they had to erect a  &quot;shield&quot; for them from swarms of enemy. Fighting is a conditioned  reflex that has to be built into our men, otherwise men will POSTURE (go  through the motions of firing to appease their peers) or FLEE or SURRENDER  as LTC David Grossman's works on killing verify. To fire effectively, one  must AIM and as SLAM shows it must be against likely AREAS where the enemy  soldier might be, not an expectation that he will appear for a sure-shot as  we see constantly in Hollywood.<br />The thing that is objectionable in MAF is  its seen by too many as a panacea---its actually a &quot;band-aid&quot; to  the problem that we have had unshielded infantry unable to advance in the  face of enemy fire for centuries even though we have the armor technology  to shield infantry by a weapons gunshield and an air-deliverable, tracked  Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV). There are times on the battlefield where  EVERYONE IS PINNED DOWN BY ENEMY FIRE--especially if infantry lacks a  shield or AFVs supporting them. SLAM has stated the problem well and given  us a temporary solution, but not the final solution. Its up to us to stop  bickering over SLAM's status, and write the concluding chapter of MAF for  our generation or else we are headed for another geostrategic defeat  because our men are ill-equipped to advance against enemy fire and win with  light casualties because we are in a state of denial wasting billions on  posturing air/sea forces.eaded for another geostrategic defeat  because our men are ill-equipped to advance against enemy fire and win with  light casualties because we are in a state of denial wasting billions on  posturing air/sea forces.	2000-08-12

Ralph Zumbro is a COMBAT veteran from Vietnam  who fought in Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) and has a mission, knows it  and then goes about enlightening us all. He begins by tracing the fact  through history that man has always used a form of armored protection  coupled with a mobility form to gain positional advantage. His book is  priceless because he realizes this is the true of mobile, mounted essence,  not ego-gratifying tank duels which wrongly pre-occupies the current  generation of tankers who should refer to themselves as a practitioners of  the sound traditional war-form of Cavalry. Battlefield functions stay the  same, though the war forms will change as the technology changes.<br />Zumbro  shows that throughout history the essence of Cavalry is to gain a mobility  differential and exploit it to gain a battlefield effect---he shows how the  Russians actually used horse Cavalry in WWII in conjunction with armored  vehicles to swarm and overwhelm Germans who on foot were at a disadvantage.  The Russians had their infantry in adequate numbers to effect battles  positively (refer to Bolger's book Death Ground: American Infantry in  Battle) ride their tanks (they do this today in Chechnya); something we  refuse to do--we insist on moving infantry around in Bradley machine gun  tanks which require a 3-man crew to man and can only carry 7 dismounts and  wonder why with this overhead cost we end up only with a handful of  &quot;security guards for tanks&quot; and not the decisive infantry force  that can maneuver and take ground apart from their armored mounts. Zumbro  shows how the Vietnames created the M113 ACAV--an all-terrain tracked AFV  with gunshields to maneuver at will and dominate the swampy rice paddy  terrains of Vietnam. A vehicle that dominated the fight in Vietnam and  could carry a full 9-13 man Infantry squad. He then concludes with AFVs  combined with helicopters for an Air-Mech combination beginning with the  Soviets in 1978 Ogaden war and in a final futuristic chapter written in Tom  Clancy style. The point of this all is to re-energize Armor branch to its  true function--as Iron, Kevlar, Chobham Cavalry not the &quot;land  battleship&quot; dueling madness that pervades the ranks today. The point  is to win battles with armored maneuver, not duel other tanks so you can  paint a &quot;kill mark&quot; on your gun tube.<br />To do this, he uses an  interesting and entertaining style to motivate and enlighten rather than a  dry scholarly approach that would bore everyone to death and in the end  fail to sway the defeatists and nay-sayers stuck in their ways regardless  of how many facts, battle won and lessons learned are arrayed in their  presence.  His book is full of important technotactical details which I'm  constantly referring to to solve today's problems. He is an Iron thinker.  There simply is no other book that better presents the truths U.S. Army  Armor branch must face if it wants to be a relevent player on the 21st  century battlefield.ned with helicopters for an Air-Mech combination beginning with the  Soviets in 1978 Ogaden war and in a final futuristic chapter written in Tom  Clancy style.

TC has never been in uniform and  is thus subject to being deceived by such bureaucracies as the marines.  When you read this book you realize Clancy has not done a lick of common  sense reflection on the fact that a mere 3 battalions (not together but in  a different ocean) out of 172,000 marines is hardly any &quot;bargain&quot;  for America at the cost of billions and billions of dollars. Just one Army  Division does better than this---out of 12,000 an entire Brigade (3  Battalions plus) in a single entity is ready to deploy to anywhere in the  world within a matter of hours. What are the 165,000 other marines doing in  CONUS? Posing for pictures and interviews for gullible media folks like  Clancy?  The meu is merely a taxi service to evacuate Americans for the  State department when our sea-based posturing and showboating fails. When  was the last time a meu did an amphibious assault in combat? Try NEVER. The  closest was some small-scale landings in Vietnam (we know how  &quot;successful&quot; these were) and these were done by maus not meus.  The meu is a masquerade for a military force, its really a saber-rattling  and evacuation service not a fighting force, regardless of how Clancy  thinks reflecting back on the allegedly tough Mc basic training changes  things. A bunch of people in tiny sizes in a ship thousands of miles away  from the action, that can move at a snail's pace are nothing to be praised  as an epitome of fighting efficiency. Maybe that's what we want, to posture  and pretend like &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, not actually  warfight; the AF will &quot;win&quot; the wars for us by long-distance  bombing with the media reporting with &quot;pin-point&quot; accuracy the  results.<br />Had Clancy written a real book on marines he would have  explored the fact that we have not done a major amphibious landing since  Korea and that was an accident---and he of all people who made his name by  naval warfare--should know that all surface ships are easily targeted from  space by their wakes and hit by anti-ship missiles, denied access to  landing sites by cheap coastal mines (remember why marines couldn't land in  Desert Storm? Remember the ships that struck Iraqi mines?) and would be  easily sunk with massive loss of American lives? It looks to the seasoned  observer that Clancy put &quot;blinders&quot; on and has written a bunch of  feel-good fluff in order to sell books to the marine/navalist market; it  will sell well in the exchanges but it sells America short with its myths  and distortions.r />Had Clancy written a real book on marines he would have  explored the fact that we have not done a major amphibious landing since  Korea and that was an accident---and he of all people who made his name by  naval warfare--should know that all surface ships are easily targeted from  space by their wakes and hit by anti-ship missiles, denied access to  landing sites by cheap coastal mines (remember why marines couldn't land in  Desert Storm?

The whole point of  &quot;scholarship&quot; is to arrive at truth; its a means to an end, not  an end unto itself. To those who are unwilling to let go of the skirt of  von Clausewitz, no amount of &quot;scholarship&quot; is going to be enough,  perhaps not even an American city in ashes from a backpack nuclear device  planted there by a terrorist who works for no nation-state. There are many  books out there that are &quot;scholarly&quot; and clueless about what is  going on in the conflict arena, they should be discarded and ignored by  those of us charged to defend freedom from real, not imagined armchair  enemies. Van Crevald is right, he makes his point without pounding his  intellect over your head with minutiae or academia that would distract the  reader from the fact that he is talking about life and death of millions of  actual, real living human beings (you and I) not some abstract bookworm  debate.<br />The Transformation of War is a critical book to the survival of  the West; it outlines that we are really in the 4th Generation of war, not  the &quot;Third Wave&quot; of human ego-gratifying human progress as  outlined by the Tofflers in War and Anti-War. Van Crevald looks into the  human condition and admits the truth we do not want to accept that man  likes to kill---and that it may have NOTHING to do with Clausewitz's  &quot;war is a continuation of [nation-state] policy by other means&quot;.  Some groups even in an idealized, &quot;New World Order&quot; will simply  fight because they want to fight; the blood lust of man runs in his own  heart, and no amount of human technological gadgetry will change this basic  condition--only divine intervention will do this. If we perpetuate bad  nation-state warfare hoping to relive WWII-style 3d Generation warfare  &quot;Desert Storms&quot; by safe, push-button warfare using air and  missile strikes with digital means tacked on, or loudly sail around the  world in surface ships to posture as being willing to fight (but not really  on the ground far inland) when we are actually seen from space where we are  easily targeted and destroyed---we will miss Van Crevald's sub-national  state warrior who bypasses our irrelevant sea-based showboat military and  strikes directly at the American people with subtle, psychological  information warfare and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Van Crevald  should know--he's an Israeli and he has seen first hand how traditional  nation-state war forms have been poor tools to fight 4th Generational wars  like the Intifada and the insurgency at the order of Lebanon. The troubles  Israel are facing are warnings to the west, and Van Crevald is trying to  sound the alarm--if we are wise enough to hear him.e bad  nation-state warfare hoping to relive WWII-style 3d Generation warfare  &quot;Desert Storms&quot; by safe, push-button warfare using air and  missile strikes with digital means tacked on, or loudly sail around the  world in surface ships to posture as being willing to fight (but not really  on the ground far inland) when we are actually seen from space where we are  easily targeted and destroyed---we will miss Van Crevald's sub-national  state warrior who bypasses our irrelevant sea-based showboat military and  strikes directly at the American people with subtle, psychological  information warfare and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

Colonel Bolger's book is an urgent read; in it he describes the  &quot;death ground&quot; that U.S. policy makers are reluctant to send  troops into and this is evaporating our infantry into a future geostrategic  policy defeat. His conclusion is chilling---we might have the finest  infantrymen of all time but there may not be ENOUGH to decide the issue. He  describes the basic types of Infantry--Airborne, Air Assault, Mechanized,  Light, Special Operations and marine and with unmatched understanding  explains their attributes and why they are so vitally needed. If you are a  military professional you need to read these description to better  understand the technotactical aspects of war and diminish the silly  chest-thumping of one's branch/MOS/service. But when you can mentally count  the number of Infantry Battalions available to America--a nation of  270,000,000; a surge of adrenaline shoots through you as you realize that  America is increasingly relying on a military that thinks precision guided  weaponry from aircraft or sea platforms will decide the issue. As Bolger  points out using real world combat examples, against a resilient foe like  North Vietnam, this firepower-- even steered by skilled infantry on the  ground may not be enough. It certainly wasn't in 1975 when communists  over-ran South Vietnam while we had total Air/Sea superiority and were  powerless to stop them.<br />The point of his book is we need more and better  Infantry modeled on an improved Airborne/Air Assault model with light  armored fighting vehicles to control the &quot;death ground&quot; and  control the peace. The current U.S. Army transformation underway hopefully  will achieve this revolution so we can dominate the &quot;death  ground&quot; in the future and not dangerously over-rely on stand-off  munitions.<br />Colonel Bolger is one of the courageous military  thinkers/doers in uniform today &quot;on point&quot; for America, and this,  his latest work builds on his technotactical oddysey begun with his  masterpiece, &quot;Dragons at War&quot;, through &quot;The Battle for  Hunger Hill&quot; and many other books.

Liddell-Hart and this, his masterpiece, Strategy--THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY BOOK EVER WRITTEN,  period---miss his humanity, miss their own and end up in a bloodbath of  frontal attrition guided by such over-rated lunatics as von Clausewitz.  Watch out for these &quot;fog of war&quot; folks and see to it that they  never command men in battle. If one is so jealous of another's intellect  when it supplies one methods to save lives that its more important to  criticize and revert to something inferior that will result in needless  deaths, that person's humanity is weak and in question. Hart was a Captain  in the British Army in WWI where he was shot at, gassed and saw first-hand  the horror of Clausewitz's &quot;climactic battle&quot; mentality in action  (not arm-chair book reviews) when nation-states duel it out and men are  torn apart horribly. Had the former lived longer, he would have seen that  his theories codified in On War are murderous lies that killed a generation  of humanity in 1914-18 when applied to mechanized, TOTAL WAR. When one  considers that if these men had lived and not been pawns in a nation-state  parlor game of von Clausewitz, how many would have discovered, invented and  cured many of man's ills. We will never know. Hart, stung from this  experience knew there had to be a better way, and found it. If there was  disgust, it was from his humanity crying out against such needless  losses.<br />Hart shows GOOD Generalship studies the lesson of history and  learns how Commanders can defeat the enemy by realizing war is a mental  contest, not a physical contest of annihilation---and to find the  &quot;center of gravity&quot; holding your opponent together and to destroy  it and collapse him. Hart finds this in the American Civil War where  Sherman marched across the south and undid the Confederate's logistical  means to fight by the technotactical ploy of &quot;flying columns&quot;  free of reliance on railroad-based logistics which had fed thousands of men  into predictable frontal conflicts killing hundreds of thousands of men. By  not glorifying in climacttic battle but instead regaining maneuver, and  having a strategic aim, Sherman while Grant held Lee's Army in the north,  placed the homeland of the enemy at risk, collapsing him quickly and saving  thousands of lives of people who were actually brethren. A burned farm can  be replanted, a life lost is lost.<br />What is so brilliant about  Strategy, is we can refer to it constantly for insights today. Hart is  intellectually honest enough to state that against a guerrilla opponent  there might not be a &quot;center of gravity&quot; to smash and collapse,  we must use maneuver to unbalance his supplies and plans. There is no doubt  that Hart's works while helping the bad guys initially (Germany 1939-1941)  were later instrumental in helping the &quot;good guys&quot; (1941-present)  free Europe, Asia, and keep the world free for the rest of the decade. Its  too bad Hart was not alive today to update his strategems of the indirect  approach for the 21st Century where 4th Generation Warfare means can bypass  professional armies and strike directly at the will of the people to  support a fight in the first place. An Army that does not have the humanity  to realize that men are not mere machines to be discarded in a meat grinder  of war is not fighting as well as it can and is out of touch with its own  humanity--those that use Clausewitz who died before seeing the folly of his  own lies in WWI to do this are criminal.<br />That some have used Hart, Sun  Tzu and others to create a maneuverism panacea to play a tune that lazy  American policy makers like (victories with low casualties) cannot be  denied, since there are situations where the enemy is defending-in-depth  and has his population totally mobilized for war. Hart admits this. Read  Hart not his wannabe imitations like FMFM 1 by the marines; dig deep, think  deep.In these situations, we will be hard pressed to find and defeat the  enemy's center of cohesion, but this should always be our aim even if we  have to fight hard to get there--something many in our military are not  willing to spend money and train/equip to do.<br />Strategy is a masterpiece  and one of our guides to defending freedom today and in the future, written  by a man who suffered greatly to get his ideas known who surely will be  rewarded in the future by the lives he saved by better militaries and  better human conditions of peace.<br />Airborne, Sir Liddell-Hart!ep.

What happened to the Hackworth who wrote the  masterpiece &quot;Guerrilla Battalion&quot; for U.S. Army Infantry magazine  in the early 1970s?<br />The point of Hackworth in &quot;About Face&quot; is  not to just criticize, but to make things better. The Hack of today in  sftt.org and his later books is devoid of the constructive criticism ending  in constructive actions we can take today. Try writing him today with a  problem/solution and you will be hard pressed to get him or his staff to  pay attention to it, they are more excited about bashing the  &quot;Clintonistas&quot; or the &quot;Purple Princes&quot; than solving  Soldier-level technotactical problems and this is sad. I love the Hack of  the 1950s, 60s and 70s who was an innovator and problem solver in the Army  Airborne and with the 9th ID in Vietnam. He needs to read his own book and  return to this perspective and stop letting bitterness over how his career  was wronged by Army politics make him advocate desperate returns to the  allegedly &quot;good ole days&quot; panaceas and outfits he's never served  in that are even more vain and hide-bound as a means to trash the Army  which is rooted in the Citizen-Soldiery of America. He is alive, isn't he?  There are 100,000+ DEAD Americans who never made the rank of Colonel still  left behind or who died in Southeast Asia who never got to come home ALIVE  and write a best-selling book. Be thankful for that.<br />The Army is only as  good as the American people themselves are; trying to build a warrior class  apart from these people and these values will only result in military  failure from arrogance and inflexibility created by false comradery. The  hard-drinking Army that Hack loves is who failed him in Korea by not  spending time studying war and dominating the debate so we didn't buy into  such silliness as atomic weapons dropped from planes keeping North Koreans  and North Vietnamese from gobbling up their neighbors. Longing for  loud-mouths who yell and scream and not think and innovate in anticipation  of the next war will not meet the challenges of the 21st century.

With thousands of miles of oceans, moving at 20 mph  the meu will never be there in time, perhaps the intention. In contrast,  Clancy shows that the Airborne delivers an entire warfighting Brigade at  500+ mph from the U.S. and within 30 minutes from leaving the aircraft over  the drop zone which is &quot;warp speed&quot; to where America needs it.  When one reads for information value and not entertainment (what  non-fiction is supposed to be) I cannot endorse Clancy's marine, but his  Airborne and Armored Cav tour books are priceless. A writer of Clancy's  stature should think more critically or have someone else do it if he is  busy and not just print what is fed to him.<br />Aside from small detail  errors the biggest downside of Clancy's Airborne is that he &quot;chickened  out&quot; when it came to the issue of Airborne light tanks, which he  mentioned in his first book, Armored Cav. In that book he explained how the  combat-proven M551 Sheridan was being replaced by the also  parachute-air-droppable M8 Armored Gun System with a 105mm  shoot-on-the-move cannon and he even wrote a futuristic war scenario in  Uganda where it was air-delivered to save the day. But when you read  Airborne you hear nothing of the men who actually jumped alongside  heavy-dropped M551 Sheridan light tanks into combat in Panama (3/73d Armor  Battalion) or the on-going effort to get a light AFV replacement for the  82d Airborne Division. A writer of his magnitude should not knuckle under  to the prevailing political pressures, which at that time were  anti-Airborne and anti-light AFVs. Today, with U.S. Army Chief of Staff  General Shinseki's &quot;transformation&quot; seeking a baseline light AFV  it would have been good advance thinking to have a section on M8 AGS light  tanks and the M113A3/4 APC as both are being considered for this  role.<br />Airborne!king a baseline light AFV  it would have been good advance thinking to have a section on M8 AGS light  tanks and the M113A3/4 APC as both are being considered for this  role.<br />Airborne!	2000-08-10

How can you be a professional Soldier and be ignorant of  its contents? This book should be on the required reading lists and be  issued to Soldiers and tested on it. This is a matter of life/death to know  the weaponry that is out there in use by us and the enemy.<br />I wish  Christopher Foss put an email address in the book so we could interact and  improve future versions of this affordable and important book. If you don't  have this book, get it right away and start studying what is out there on  the battlefield. I learn something every day from this book.<br />Airborne!	2000-08-10

Its infuriating to read so many people praise a book they clearly do not understand when they think its a bunch of flowery Chinese words that can  apply to anything and any situation. This is a sign that these folks do not  understand THE most important book ever written about warfare. Because of  this Western mindset failing, I have to place B.H. Liddell-Hart's Strategy  as the FIRST and most important military book ever written--read this first  THEN tackle Sun Tzu's Art of War. Together these are THE two most important  military books ever written and for the impatient I will explain  why.<br />Hart explains through military history how warfare is a mental  battle that is executed in the physical plane for a tangible result. Sun  Tzu's thrust is the same--and its not just a gimmick or a ploy one uses by  tacking onto a Western mindset of materialism or the like. The Eastern mind  which Sun Tzu articulates does not see war or conflict as &quot;good&quot;  or as a means to an end. Its in a fascinating way, a view that is more  Judeo-Christian than the so-called Protestant reformation-based West's  concepts of positional warfare and a climactic battle as a form of a  nation-state duel that justifies their existence (raison d-etre) in that  Sun Tzu sees the highest form of warfare is AVOIDING IT by deception and  psychological ploys that result in the enemy becoming your friend because  war is a waste for everyone that practices it. Those that see Sun Tzu as an  after-school karate class one takes to be a nice-to-have adjunct to an  ends-justifies-the-means run-over-people-to-get-what-you-want Western  mindset are &quot;missing the boat&quot; and reading the book at a very  shallow, selfish level. These folks are really wannabe Samarai reading a  book for quiet ninjas.<br />Sun Tzu also goes on to show that the epitome of  warfighting is NOT &quot;prolonged operations, however brilliantly  executed&quot;  but the General who can avoid war and ironically by so  doing receives no glory or acclaim yet is the true hero of the people and  the state. What this means is that today--in the 21st Century with the  information warfare means available to us, we can for the first time  execute Sun Tzu's vision better than ever before because we can bypass  armies and bloody fights and reach the hearts/minds of the people  themselves--if we are clever and moral enough to do so. If we think of Sun  Tzu as a parlor trick, we will not have the morality to persuade the other  person to join our side and the trickery of physical fighting will only  yield a temporary victory as the enemy rebounds at a later date. Sun Tzu  looks deep into the human condition, to understand him you have to do the  same; the way of a ninja is more closely related to this kind of thinking  than a samurai looking for public acclaim/attention. A true ninja today  would use Sun Tzu to make the militaries of the free world more effective  in 4th Generation War (See Van Crevald's The Transformation of War) and use  all the customary battlefield tricks of indirectness and deception he talks  about if these primary efforts fail. If you want to truly understand Sun  Tzu, get your mind on the right boat to China and look deep into your  condition as a human and put aside what he says as gimmicks.receives no glory or acclaim yet is the true hero of the people and  the state.

In it, General James M. Gavin expresses the truth that we can no longer deny: that  ship-based warfare is obsolete and our world moves by the AIR. Those who  control the air control the peace. Written before the Korean War, if we had  adopted its proposals for lightweight, air-delivered armored vehicles we  wouldn't have suffered like we did in Korea. Gavin is right on about our  need today for &quot;KIWI&quot; (a bird without wings in case you didn't  know) pod delivering aircraft to get EVERY UNIT into the Airborne Warfare  business. The USAF toyed with the XC-123 packet plane but gave up on the  idea for planes that require runways and must be loaded for each use. Gavin  advocates a plane that would be &quot;cow pasture&quot; capable (land  anywhere) whose Kiwi pods would be pre-loaded by the user unit beforehand.  These pods could be owned by these units for training and mission  readiness.<br />Advanced KIWI pods could be tracked themselves to be their  own vehicles on the ground. A brilliant combat leader and theorist, General  Gavin thought across service branch lines and arrived at the best ways to  effect Airborne Warfare---what we have today is Airstrike warfare advocated  by the fighter-bomber jocks in the Air Force. True Airborne Warfare as  advocated by Generals Billy Mitchell (supposedly the AF's patron saint) and  Gavin was about delivering GROUND FORCES that decisively maneuver and  defeat enemies completely by controlling the ground where people live.<br />We need to update and reprint this book to reinspire this nation to a  position of true warfighting excellence instead of the obsolete sea-based  (robots in the future) posturing we do now where we think air strikes will  win wars by themselves at no risk to Americans.<br />I hope Amazon.com with  its connections will bring about a reprinting of this book..if they need a  copy which to do this, I have one to loan for this purpose!<br />Airborne!irborne!	2000-08-07

B-20 went into the DESERT ON FOOT WITHOUT MOTOR  VEHICLES and then tried to destroy SCUD SSMs by close-range demolition  attack. This was sheer lunacy, you can barely even manpack enough water let  alone all the mission gear needed. Across the coverless desert you will be  hard pressed to locate and then close on foot to destroy a mobile  target.<br />The lesson learned here is NOT to gush over SOF machismo but to  use one's brain and devise a better way, such as rolling off the back end  of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter in a small Wiesel tracked Armored Fighting  Vehicle (2 per helicopter), HMMWVs American SFOD-Delta used or the famous  British SAS gun jeeps. Where were these for this mission? Equip these  vehicles with long-range missiles and you might have a chance at detecting  a mobile target and then rapidly destroying it. If you are detected by the  enemy you can fight/drive your way out to continue the mission or reach a  pre-arranged extraction point. When we start doing Special Ops with more  special thinking and less drooling over our manhood we'd be more successful  than the current 50% success rate.	2000-08-07

The  other chapters express the desire to collapse enemies with maneuver rather  than try to attrit/wipe them out. What we need today is a sequel where we  explain 4th generation war, how we need both forces that can collapse  enemies with Air-Mech 3-D maneuver AND 2-D firepower/mechanical advantage  to overcome enemies in cities; combining Bolger with the other authors into  a stronger whole.<br />These authors are the best thinkers in the U.S.  military today and it would be great to see them unite again with some of  the new military theorists for a sequel.<br />Airborne!	2000-08-06

Maneuver warfare regardless of how entertaining and  readable is a poison menu offering easy victories that sets up the American  public for dissillusionment and defeat when these lofty promises are  undelivered and the clever asymmetric enemy targets perceptions through the  media using 4th Generation war means.<br />This book is fatally dated and  needs to be dismissed and replaced by more balanced, innovative thinking  that is geared to the 4th Generation war reality we live in today, not  trying to relive the German blitzkrieg ala 1940 with 3d Generation war  means. Sea-based posturing and small-force Maneuverism failed at the  fortified cities of Tobruk, Stalingrad, Bastogne, and more recently in  Lebanon and Somalia, something the doctrines espoused in this book do not  take into account.<br />We need REAL original thinking about war, not wannabe  German left-overs. We need ACTION and EQUIPMENT not &quot;3 block war&quot;  TALK to dominate future city fights, and a doctrine that is more balanced  than easy maneuverism cleverly manipulated to advance the agenda of an  obsolete sea-based service bureaucracy.<br />Airborne!	2000-08-06

Books	5	7	8	N	N	Peters knows cause/effect	The best thing about LTC Peters is NOT the details of what's going on  today, these will change as time goes on. The most important thing is that  he has actual cause/effect logic in place whereas most people are awash in  a sea of relativism.<br /> When Peters talks about cityfights (cause), he  then concludes that we need actual cityfight weapons/equipment (effect) not  just &quot;3 block war&quot; trash talk. What we the readers must do is  APPLY his conclusions and get the U.S. Army into a better position to  dominate the 21st Century battlefield with a siege capability to oust evil  dictators with low casualties.<br /> We need to do more than praise Peters,  we need to apply what he says.

He  takes what he knows to be true as a current U.S. Army battlefield Commander  and applies this experience to fresh thinking far better than any arm-chair  wannabe who praises another service that has not done its homework and  thought very deep about the issues, but is deep in platitudes. The 9  Principles of war (MOOSE MUSS) as we remember them are actually derived  from Clausewitz if another reviewer had his wits about him. They are a  guide to thinking no more divinely inspired as the writings of Big Al or  the wannabe tacticians of America's sea-based posturers.<br /> LTC Leonhard  is one of America's and the Army's best and brightest thinker-warriors who  refuses to succomb to the platitudes of the past or the present  Germanophiles, who omit in their discussions that maneuverism died in the  fortress cities of Tobruk, Stalingrad, Bastogne when it met the  defense-in-depth fueled by a nation at total war.

All of the innuendos and references to common cultural icons as well as being in the U.S. Army for about 2 decades made the book come alive like new.<br /> To fully understand OAE you need to be in the  military or a veteran. Just to understand the lingo of such things like  &quot;TO and E&quot;. If you are not Army, get that way!<br /> When I first  OAE I was desperately looking for heroes. Today, I see myself in the book.  The reason is that if you care about the mission and the men certain  inevitable conclusions will follow. Sam Damon is concerned about saving  lives and he is a technotactical wizard who sees the connection between  cargo net construction and wasting valuable time at sea exposed to enemy  fire. As a military professional, I am able to read the book and  vicariously live the experiences of WWI/WWII Army life as Myrer knew that  life was.<br /> I reread the book to try to understand Courtney Massengale  and why he is such a monster and how  many today are like him. Clearly the  answer is that Massengale believes in nothing. Life is what you can get for  yourself and he goes through the motions of life in his own mental caccoon  not loving anyone least of all himself.<br /> Massengale got this way by  losing daily contact with lower ranking people in the Army. In contrast,  Sam stays close to the men and can handle the truth unvarnished whereas  Massengale wants it sanitized. Interestingly Myrer has Damon meet General  MacArthur and shows him in a good light as anguished over leaving his men  in the Philipines yet employing creative bypass tactics saving lives.<br />  OAE is a very clever book full of hidden meanings and connections if you  look for them. I even found Damon advocating the speed march as a way to  &quot;maneuver warfare&quot; and collapse enemies, as his gamble at Moapora  did. The insights into how the Germans failed to take Gibralter to control  the Med were very interesting..I suggest reading the book with a highlight  pen, making your own notes in the margins the next time you read OAE.<br />  If you get a chance to see the TV mini-series, the U.S. Army and Armed  Forces Radio-TV is said to be showing the series overseas in a few months  and perhaps you could get a serviceman to tape it for you.<br /> Sam Damon is  making a big comeback in the U.S. military!<br /> I think its time we write a  sequel to OAE. I like the 1976 TV mini-series cover and wish to see it on a  new version of the book in paperback. The TV mini-series has a better  ending than the book, but the book's ending is designed to trouble you.<br />  SAM DAMON LIVES!r to control  the Med were very interesting..I suggest reading the book with a highlight  pen, making your own notes in the margins the next time you read OAE.  <br />  If you get a chance to see the TV mini-series, the U.S. Army and Armed  Forces Radio-TV is said to be showing the series overseas in a few months  and perhaps you could get a serviceman to tape it for you. <br /> Sam Damon is  making a big comeback in the U.S. military! <br /> I think its time we write a  sequel to OAE.
