During his tenure on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Scalia has led a continuous assault on judicial tinkering. The rule of law, he has argued, demands that we be bound by the text of the law-not by evolving social standards, not even by some elusive authorial intent, but by the actual words of the Constitution and of the statutes passed by state and federal legislatures.<br /><br />Scalia has articulated this textualist philosophy in his frequent public lectures, in his penetrating book A Matter of Interpretation, and in his many Supreme Court opinions. In Scalia Dissents: Writings of the Supreme Court's Wittiest, Most Outspoken Justice, attorney Kevin A. Ring collects some of the most memorable of these opinions. The stated aim of this volume is to bring to a wider audience \\"some of the most noteworthy, colorful, and entertaining opinions ever written by a United States Supreme Court Justice.\\" More important, the collection traces the development of Scalia's view-derided by progressive law professors and controversial even among conservatives-that, in Ring's words, \\"laws-and especially that supreme law known as the Constitution of the United States-say what they mean and mean what they say.\\"<br /><br />Over the past twenty years, perhaps the happiest outcome of the Court's many miserable decisions is that they provide Scalia with occasions for writing opinions that are both persuasive and entertaining. This book contains many. This well-organized volume gives readers not only an introduction to Scalia's thought but a guided tour through the difficult issues the Supreme Court has addressed in recent years. Read together, Scalia's opinions are a bracing antidote to the legal opportunism that has infected many of the Court's recent decisions. They are also a troubling reminder that the infection continues to spread.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]	2005-10-07

How refreshing it has been to finally find such an astute rendition of the Crusades without having to muddle through the usual Anti-Christian bias and the protrayal of the Muslems as innocent victims of Christian barbarism. As Asbridges's title suggest, A NEW HISTORY begins in the beginning.  The First Crusade was called in 1095 in response to an urgent plea for assistance from the Byzantine Empire, the last Christian state in the East. Things had been going badly for Christians for several centuries, ever since the infestation of Muslim warriors out of Arabia in the seventh century. Egypt, Palestine, Syria, North Africa-the core of the Christian world-had been conquered by Muslim jihad warriors and subjected to Islamic rule and law. When Turkish jihad warriors invaded and conquered Asia Minor, they reduced Christendom to a tiny corner of the world.<br /><br />Pope Urban II asked Christians to take up the cross and turn back these conquests as an act of penance. Thousands responded. The First Crusade, which was, in typical medieval fashion, governed by a committee of barons, marched thousands of miles across eastern Europe, crossed the Bosporus at Constantinople, and then pushed on to Nicaea, which served as the capital of the Turkish sultanate. After restoring Nicaea to the Byzantine emperor, the Crusaders crossed Anatolia and against all odds restored to Christian control the city of Antioch, one of the ancient patriarchates of Christianity. The Crusaders also acquired nearby Edessa and then continued south along the coast until they finally turned inland and caught their first glimpse of the holy city of Jerusalem. After prayers, penances, and many hardships, they captured it in July 1099.<br /><br />Asbridge's history works well on many levels. He tells his story vividly, but he does not shy away from details that may muddy his otherwise clear picture. When a scholarly debate exists on a point, he brings it up forthrightly and describes it succinctly. Throughout his narrative he liberally sprinkles footnotes that direct interested readers to the best scholarship available. With knowledge of medieval siege weapons, armor, and basic army conditions, Asbridge argues that the internal command of the First Crusade was not as fractious as historians have generally believed. What really adds depth and color to this history, though, is Asbridge's familiarity with the region and the careful attention with which he describes it. Readers see the landscapes and fortifications through the eyes of someone who has studied them closely.<br /><br />This is the most concise and readable volume I have found pertaining to the origin of the Crusades.

Since that time, I have never read anything from this magnificent author/historian in which I was even slightly dissappointed.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />Professor Morris spent over half a century writing extraordinary works on American History. This book, one of Morris' later works, chronicles the early careers of seven of our greatest leaders; Ben Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. Morris devotes roughly 40 pages to each, so this is by no means an indepth look at each man, but rather a solid and insightful introduction. I was particularly impressed with his chapter on John Jay, which is not surprising given Morris' excellent biography on Jay, JOHN JAY, THE NATION, AND THE COURT, which was published just a few years prior to this book.<br /><br />If you haven't read Morris before, buy this book.

It's often said that truth is stranger than fiction.  This book proves it can also be said that truth is more exciting than fiction. This is not normally the type book I would read (you can tell from my reviews), but it was given to me and after just the first few pages, I knew this book would be a winner.<br /><br />I did some diving in the Navy about a lifetime ago and this book brought back memories with crystal clear clarity of the rigors and emotions of diving. Kurson puts into words with intricate detail, what diving is truly like, far better than I have ever been able to do. Even someone who has never donned a pair of fins will find themselves rivited to the romantic fantasy of exploring an unexplored deep water wreck.<br /><br />This book holds all the drama, intrigue and passion of the best fiction novels, wrapped up in a true account. Most of what I review is good for a specific target audience, such as history buffs, military buffs, or politicos, but the target audience for this book would be anyone who enjoys reading.	2005-10-01

If the reader is looking for a day to day account of the American doughboy, this book isn't it, but if you are looking for a detailed account of the roll America played in the great war, this book covers a tremendous amount of information.<br /><br />There are certain portions of text devoted to the doughboys.  For instance, 3 of the books 400 plus pages of text, tell of the heroics of Alvin York. Another 5 pages tell of Maj. Whittsley and the 77th Division, now known as the \\"Lost Battalion\\". But you will find little detail of the rigors endured by the American doughboy.<br /><br />Just like the American involvement in the war, this book is painfully slow to get started. The first 100 pages seem to dredge at times as Mead's focus is on other aspects of war, such as financial backing from American bankers such as J.P. Morgan. Most of the next 50 or so pages address the logistical difficulties faced by Pershing in moving the massive numbers of troops into the campaign.<br /><br />It is rather fitting and appropo that Mead, an Englishman, has so precisely outlined the American role in the war. Europeans yet today, tend to downplay the American roll, primarily because our causalties, though numerous, paled in comparison to the Frence and British losses, and our involvement came after several years of conflict, but Mead puts the importance of the American roll into it's proper perspective. Mead clearly deliniates that it was America's entrance into the fray that turned the tide on the Hun once and for all.<br /><br />This is a very good book, loaded with factual accounts and statistics, but it is not an in-depth look at the Doughboys. Perhaps the book could have been more entertaining, but I cannot discredit the historical accuracy nor the volume of information contained here. If you seek a good accont of American involvement in the war, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]ok for you.    Monty Rainey  [...]	2005-08-21

This is the second of Dreisbach's books which I have read, the first being REAL THREAT AND MERE SHADOW, with which he won my admiration.  The research Dreisbach puts into his work is second to no one and this book follows in that vain. With this book, Dreisbach further promotes the proof that the United States were founded upon Christian principles.<br /><br />With this installment, Dreisbach gives a microscopic examination of a sermon given by Reverend Jasper Adams at St. Michael's Church in Charleston, S.C. on 13 February 1833. The sermon was subsequently published in its entirety and widely distributed.  Reverend Adams sent out numerous copies to prominent statesmen and other prominent figures urging their review of its content. Some notables who responded to the request were Mr. Justice Joseph Story, former president and constitutional architect James Madison, and Chief Supreme Court Justice John Marshall.<br /><br />Adams' sermon was aptly named \\"The Relation of Christianity to Civil Government in the United States.\\"  Following an extraordinarily informative introduction, PART ONE of the book examines the sermon itself, followed by Rev. Adams' notes on the sermon. PART TWO examines some of the notable responses which it produced. The book is completed with an Epilog and Four Appendix that give the reader a great deal of information on the life of Rev. Adams, as well as a remarkable Bibliography.<br /><br />As with the other work I have read from this author, Dreisbach's research is beyond reproach and he makes an impregnable and irrefutable case for the role that Christianity has played in the establishment of the United States as a nation.

I purchased this book a couple of months ago in preparation for my grandkids next visit.  Well, this past weekend, they were left in my care and I took the opportunity to share the story with them.  The mystery of the hidden treasure remains a mystery.<br /><br />In reading the reviews of others of this book, I find people either loved it, or were deeply disappointed with it.  I place myself amoung the latter category, but must admit my grandkids, ranging from ages 6 to 13, loved it.<br /><br />You may recall, a few years ago, those pictures were quite popular where you stared at a bunch of dots until you saw some hidden form.  Invariably, someone would shout, \\"Oh look!  A dinosaur! (sailboat or some other form)\\".  Well, I never saw those darned dinosaurs.  They just looked like a bunch of dots to me.  I experienced a similar frustration with this book.  The clues I did find were not very helpful.  My grandkids, however, were jubilant with each letter they uncovered, which made the whole ordeal worthwhile.<br /><br />From a literary sense, I thought the story could have been much better.  Even for a children's book, the writing seemed amateurish.  The concept, however, is wonderful and I hope other writers of children's books will develop the concept further.<br /><br />At $20, you may want to pass on this book, but I must admit, it is a great way to spend some time with your kids or grandkids.	2005-03-24

The sad thing is, as Rev.

First published in 1823, we find that government usurpation of the rights of states and individuals is not exactly a twentieth century revelation.<br /><br />The language of 180 years ago, coupled with Taylor's agonizing repetitiveness, make this a somewhat tedious and difficult read, but one that is certainly worth the effort. The basic theme of the book is how nationalism was proposed and defeated in favor of federalism at our Constitutional Convention, however, there has been, from the beginning, a behind the scenes push to propagate a system of nationalism by what would be considered today, a liberal governmental faction. Taylor meticulously explains how this objective was set into motion and its consequences of the deterioration of states rights and personal freedoms.  It doesn't take much effort for the knowledgeable reader to see how that battle has been furthered in the years since Taylor first exposed the nationalism gameplan.<br /><br />Americans today tend to look upon the misdeeds of government and ask, \\"How can they get away with doing that?\\"  Taylor clearly illustrates how it all began and that there is nothing new under the sun.  But he also goes further in explaining various ways of \\"righting the ship\\" so to speak, and discusses the consequences of each differing course of action.<br /><br />Oh, if we could only find a congressman today who possessed the clear headed tenacity of John Taylor of Caroline.  A person who would fear not the consequences of unpopularity and stand tall to examine the true principles upon which our founding promoted.<br /><br />If you are conservative, this book is a must read and will arm you with ammunition to clearly discuss states' rights and original intent.  If you are a liberal, this outstanding book will help cure your mental condition and lead you down a path of understanding.<br /><br />As an endnote, I don't normally comment on the quality of the book itself, but this one warrants comment.

Countless volumes have chronicled the war in Europe and the Pacific, but little has been devoted to the American experience in North Africa.  Perhaps it is because, to write about it, is to expose the sorry state of military preparedness in which the U.S. military was in.<br /><br />FDR is often hailed as a great leader of the 20th century, yet he failed in his duties to adequately prepare for the inevitable entrance into the war. Atkinson tells the complete story in graphic and well written detail about how the U.S. military came of age in North Africa by changing first, it's leadership, followed by tactics and weaponry. Atkinson exposes military weaknesses through such antiquated tactics as using cavalry to combat machine gun emplacements and training with simulated weapons.<br /><br />The reader witnesses the evolution of the U.S. military as the world's super power as it transitions from one agonizing defeat after another, into a force which would eventually drive the Germans out of Africa.  North Africa became, in effect, a training ground for the military that would prepare them for their future campaigns in Sicily, Italy and Western Europe.<br /><br />It is truly a pleasurable gift to read Atkinson's writing style.

It's not possible to give a detailed description of the life and accomplishments of Jefferson in a mere 200 pages of text, but Bernstein has presented a fine basic summary of Jefferson' life. I don't necessarily agree with all of Bernstein's conclusions, and he seems to allow a bit of liberalism to skew his viewpoints, but nonetheless, there is a definite market for a book of this sort.<br /><br />This is not an indepth, detailed analysis of Jefferson.  For that, see such works as Dumas Malone's 6-volume set which took over 30 years to compose.  What this book is, is a quick easy introduction and overview of Jefferson.  If you are wanting to learn about Jefferson but not wanting to wade through 600 pages of Willard Sterne Randall's account, or even a the brief version by Joseph Ellis, which is just over 300 pages of text, then this is a perfect fit for you.  At less than 200 pages, this is a quick, easy read.<br /><br />I only have a couple of knocks on the book.  For one, Bernstein seems genuinely disturbed that Jefferson did in fact own slaves and spends, I think, too much time debating the issue of Jefferson fathering the children of Sally Hemmings. Let us not forget that Jefferson was, in fact, a southern planter and owning slaves was accepted and commonplace.  That is not an endorsement, but simply a statement of fact, and one that I believe Jefferson should not be condemned for considering the time in which he lived.<br /><br />The other problem I have with this book occurs on pages 144 - 145.  Here the author is addressing Jefferson's efforts to Christianize Native Americans. Bernstein states;<br /><br />\\"Setting aside his commitment to strict separation of church and state, he sent Christian missionaries to establish schools in western territories to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity.\\"<br /><br />Never does Bernstein ponder that perhaps Jefferson was not the \\"strict separationists\\" which revisionist historians have led us to believe.  In fact, this statement stands as a testament that Jefferson's metaphor of a \\"wall of separation\\" has in fact, been greatly distorted. Sending missionaries to educate and convert Native Americans, was not, as the First Amendment forbids, \\"an establishment of religion\\", but does give weight to the argument that America was, in fact, founded as a \\"Christian\\" nation.  It is difficult to accept this type of short-sightedness by the author, but then, we live in a society where this type of short-sightedness is commonplace.<br /><br />The book skims through Jefferson's life from birth to death and beyond and includes 16 glossy pages of black and white plates, 30 pages of notes, a chronology and biographical essay. If you've read other books on Jefferson, you may be disappointed as this is, for the most part, a condensed version.

This book is somewhat of an addition to that theory.<br /><br />Friedelbaum assumes that with the changing face of the Supreme Court during the Reagan and Bush administrations, that a coalition of six or seven conservative members frequently dominate the Court's decision making, and in some areas this majority has produced dramatic, new conservative precedents. However, history does not validate this assumption when you consider that the Warren Court's main rulings all remain in effect. The Supreme Court is still in the Brennan Era. That fact cannot be disputed.<br /><br />Because members of the Court were appointed by conservative presidents, does not in any way, make today's Court a conservative one.  Can anyone, with a straight face, make the claim that Mr. Justice Souter (nominated by G.H.W. Bush) or Mr. Justice Stevenson (nominated by Ford) or Mr. Justice Kennedy (nominated by Reagan), are a part of a conservative coalition?<br /><br />Each chapter approaches a different topic including federalism, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the religion clauses, death penalty and others. Each chapter also includes various case studies and conclusions.  The book is well written and well research, but I believe it is an exercise in \\"the sky is falling!\\" and without merit to reach the conclusions reached by the author.

This is never more true than in a free society where it can be expanded to say, \\"with freedom comes responsibility\\". Kelleher builds upon this in his book by explaining that there are two kinds of \\"freedom\\". There is freedom in the libertarian sense, which we might call \\"freedom from\\". This \\"freedom from\\" includes freedom from infringement upon property rights, freedom from violence of our fellow humans, freedom from government usurpation of rights, etc.  The Bill of rights in the U.S. Constitution lays out many of these freedoms. It is worth noting that all of these freedoms are basically a limitation of outside interference on the individual. Kelleher goes to tell us there is another kind of \\"freedom\\" that has crept into our society. It is the \\"freedom to\\". There is now the freedom to have affordable housing, the freedom to be fed, the freedom to have health care, or to an education.<br /><br />The author explains with clarity that trying to implement both types of freedom comes with accompanying problems due to the fact that these two freedoms are mutually exclusive. To provide someone with a freedom to affordable housing, the wealth used to give it must be taken from someone whether they want to give it up or not. Thus, we see that any transfer of wealth to provide a \\"freedom to\\" is an imposition on the rights of a person who has a \\"freedom from\\". We can see the \\"freedom from\\" rights are inherent in the constitution and require a passive government, while the \\"freedom to\\" rights are manufactured by the social system and require the active interference of government and coercive force.<br /><br />Kelleher uses this concept and many others to take a whole new approach to social problems. His book is packed full of ideas and analysis about modern American sociology that will leave the casual reader in awe and the attentive student considering new perspectives.<br /><br />Kelleher's book provides a sound understanding of what it means to have a free society, how it should work, how to identity inherent problems and how to correct those problems.

I don't remember when I have finished reading a book and felt like I learned as much as I learned from this incredible book. As far as I can find, Daniel Dreisbach is a little known author who has written about a half dozen books on religious liberty and the First Amendment. I do not understand why Mr. Dreisbach is not a more acclaimed author, as his writing style is succinct, his research is exhaustive, and his conclusions are infallible.<br /><br />Dreisbach himself gives an apt description of this book in the opening paragraph of his Conclusion chapter, when he writes;<br /><br />\\"If only one conclusion emerges from this study, it should be that history can be, indeed has been, used and misused by strict separationists and nonprefentialists alike. The religion clauses are particularly susceptible prepossessions in the guise of historical interpretation.  Sadly, the Supreme Court has been one of the chief abusers of the historical record.\\"<br /><br />The book first examines the battle of intentialist versus nonintentionalist theories of judicial interpretation. The author gives sound evidence from both Jefferson and Madison, two founders' whose views have been perverted greatly by the judiciary, in defense of the intentialist theory. Here a precedent is set for the author to follow throughout the book, where he continues to use similar instances of how history has been perverted and distorted to support the views of nonintentialists or nonpreferentialist or even strict separationists.<br /><br />Much attention is given to recorded material, which has been largely overlooked or omitted by the judiciary.  For example, Mr. Justice Black singled out Jefferson's Revisal number 82 in his opinion in the famed Everson case, but failed to mention Revisals 83-85 which called for protecting the property rights of the Anglican Church (no other church was protected), a blue law bill which also called for prohibiting disturbing citizens in the peaceful expression of their religion, a bill for appointing days of public fasting and Thanksgiving, and finally a bill which called for the recognition of Biblical (Levitical) Law.<br /><br />The end result, Dreisbach succeeds in soundly rebutting the views of strict separationists such as Leo Pfeffer, Hugo Black and others. This is the best book I have read on the subject of the First Amendment and religious liberty, and there have been many good volumes written.  Then again, this is not a book that you can \\"read' per se.  This is a book that must be studied as the text makes up only half of this volume.  This book has an incredibly extensive notes section and a bibliography that is unbelievable.  I have already added about a dozen \\"must reads\\" to my reading list from this fine work.<br /><br />I cannot recommend Dreisbach's book highly enough.  This must definitely added to the essential reading list of anyone wanting to learn more about how Jefferson's \\"Wall of Separation\\" metaphor has been distorted and abused, and how our federal judiciary has used selective views of history to support their conclusions, rather than using all-inclusive views of history to reach their judicial decisions.<br /><br />I found this little known book completely by accident.  I have had on my reading list, another book by Dreisbach called Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation Between Church and State. I found this earlier work by Dreisbach referenced in another book and decided I should read his earlier work first.

This book has an incredibly extensive notes section and a bibliography that is unbelievable.  I have already added about a dozen \\"must reads\\" to my reading list from this fine work.     I cannot recommend Dreisbach's book highly enough.  This must definitely added to the essential reading list of anyone wanting to learn more about how Jefferson's \\"Wall of Separation\\" metaphor has been distorted and abused, and how our federal judiciary has used selective views of history to support their conclusions, rather than using all-inclusive views of history to reach their judicial decisions.    I found this little known book completely by accident.  I have had on my reading list, another book by Dreisbach called Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation Between Church and State. I found this earlier work by Dreisbach referenced in another book and decided I should read his earlier work first.  I'm truly glad that I did and will order other books by Dreisbach immediately.

Having landed over 30,000 British and Hessian troops on American soil, it appeared the King would successfully quell the rebellion. British forces had expelled the Colonial Army from New York and across New Jersey and the Delaware River. Meanwhile they had regained Rhode Island. Their strategy of retaking and pacifying one colony at a time seemed to be working. If the British could wrangle a major defeat of Washington and the Continental Army an end to the Revolution was certain. Even so, many thought that unless Washington acted quickly, the Red Coats would simply win by default, whether or not General Washington were captured.<br /><br />But then the British forces made a fatal miscalculation.  Abiding by the long established rules of \\"civility\\" in warfare, they wintered over, awaiting fairer battle weather in the spring of 1777.<br /><br />Fisher tells the fascinating and dramatic story of the events of the 1776 winter campaign that turned the tide from an inevitable British victory to an inevitable American victory. Washington's Crossing in the pre-dawn hours on the day after Christmas of 1776 back into New Jersey was a tremendous ordeal for his troops which were ill-shod, ill-clothed and weary. But the story of the Battles of Trenton and Princeton are more than a blow-by-blow record of struggle and heroism. These battles had great meaning for the participants, the people of that generation as well as every generation down to Americans today.<br />The reader is treated to an exciting account of an historical event coupled with a fascinating analysis of its importance in nearly 400 pages of pointed prose. The extensive appendices serve not only to back David Hackett Fischer's cogent analysis, but also adds interesting perspectives on historiography, art and statistics.<br /><br />No doubt that \\"Washington's Crossing\\" benefits from voluminous sources that describe every facet of the battles, from the perspective of command and control down to acts of individual heroism and what the individual soldiers were doing and thinking. This is a fun and informative read any lover of American history will not want to miss.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />Junto Societyve of command and control down to acts of individual heroism and what the individual soldiers were doing and thinking.

Kramer has constructed a masterful work here that belongs in every American's library.  When it comes to subjects like judicial review, many author's, themselves often constitutional attorneys, have a tendency to go out of their way to try to write \\"over the head\\" of the political novice.  Not the case with Kramer's work.  He writes in a succinct fashion that will be appreciated by both judicial professionals and constitutional beginners alike.<br /><br />Much evidence is found here which doesn't really repudiate, and in many ways, supports that judicial review was in fact, the intent of the framer's and perhaps even a logical conclusion. Kramer doesn't really attempt to defy the judiciary claim of their right of review, but beyond that point, Kramer takes the gloves off and pounds away at what he categorizes as \\"judicial tyranny\\", the court usurping it's constitutional boundaries.<br /><br />Kramer details the 200 year evolution of the court's abuse of power, beginning before MARBURY when the idea of judicial review came into play, through what we find today with the judiciary legislating from the bench and completely dismissing state's rights.  It is also most interesting how the author chronicles Madison's changing opinion of judicial review.<br /><br />This book, in many ways, mirrors and supports the earlier work by Martyn Babitz, THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM, where both authors support Madison's concession that the \\"states only political recourse [over the federal courts] is through elections and impeachment\\". But Kramer hints of other possibilities at controlling our out of control judiciary in his epilogue when he writes;<br /><br />\\"The Constitution leaves room for countless political responses to an overly assertive Court: Justices can be impeached, the Court's budget can be slashed, the President can ignore its mandates, Congress can strip it of jurisdiction or shrink its size or pack it with new members or give it burdensome new responsibilities or revise its procedures.\\"<br /><br />Interesting possibilities, to be sure.  In conclusion, I believe Kramer concedes judicial review as bona fide, but constructs a solid foundation to dispute the notion of judicial supremacy.  This is a very enjoyable book that I learned a great deal from.  The book at times, does read a bit slow, but that has nothing to do with Kramer's writing style, it has to do with the fact that you are constantly finding new information and referring back to the bibliography, which will no doubt lead the reader to numerous other books to add to your reading list.

Capitalists will admire the level of precision with which Gersemann destroys the arguments of those opposed to the American system of capitalism.<br /><br />Detractors who favor the European system (at least those with the intellectual ability to do so) will concede to the error of this thinking.  The book is comprised of short narratives followed up by indepth explanations with which the author incessantly debunks myth after myth of the European view of American capitalism ranging from second jobs to taxation.<br /><br />Gersemann's writing will appeal to both the economic layman and the economic scholar.  The layman will be endowed with a newfound knowledge of economics while the economist will be delighted with the statistical analysis that will challenge the wits of the most overeducated of peers.<br /><br />As great as all this is, I must mention the absolute icing on the cake of this fine book.  Cowboy Capitalism will surely prove a means of holding accountable those politicians who, destructively as one must conclude after reading this book, seek to transform our system of free market into a mirror of European government intervention.	2005-01-13

It is essential reading for anyone wanting to learn about the unending problems of the land of Palestine.<br /><br />Hazony is an excellent writer. The book begins as a slow, lumbering read, hard to get into, but you must get through the Introduction and first few Chapters. Then the book begins to roll and you will find yourself unable to put it down. The only complaint I have of this book is that mine is the paperback edition and the print font is too small. Spend a few extra dollars and get the hardback if you are over 40 and need reading glasses.<br /><br />Yoram Hazony writes and expresses so clearly what has been on so many of our minds when we see Israel today. The anti-Jewish influence shows up on Israeli TV, in Israeli schoolbooks, Meretz party, and such anti-Zionist newspapers as Ha'aretz. Hazony tells us who these people are and what their background is.<br /><br />The book describes in great detail, the workings of Herzl, Ben-Gurion and Buber. The inner workings of modern Israeli government are carefully dissected. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the intellectual struggle that is as important to the State as relations with its Arab neighbors. Hazony's unimpeachable scholarship and his fluid writing style makes it an enjoyable must read.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br /><br />[...]	2005-01-09

A compact biography (384 pages) by Oxford Historian Geoffrey Best is far and away the best I have read on Churchill. The many facets of Churchill's life are covered in a series of essays from the author. Best summarizes Churchill's life with clarity and high degree of accuracy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a comprehensive study on Churchill, this isn't it. You won't find page after page of stilted verbiage here, but you will find a well written presentation of this fascinating man, perhaps the savior of England. If it is possible to write a detailed account of such a varied figure within the brevity of such a small volume, the author has done so admirably.<br /><br />Though the author clearly admires the subject, this isn't just another \\"I love Churchill\\" book. Best gives a fair and balanced account of many areas where Churchill may have erred, such as Gallipolli. The book is fair, and it is no-nonsense, to the point, without a lot of ambivalent inflection.<br /><br />I have a number of volumes on the life and times of Churchill.

Cole's book, though from a conservative perspective, doesn't live up to its subtitle. Most of the book is a review of points from the works of Ambrose, Augustine, Aquinas and Calvin. Each of these authors is summarized on the topics. The chapter headings give a good idea of the direction of the work. Some are: Why Christians use force; Christian Virtue and Warfare; When Christians should fight; How Christians should fight; and then three chapters dealing with the Second World War, Vietnam and the Gulf War; Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence; and finally Just Warfare and Terrorism.<br /><br />At only 160 pages, the book doesn't begin to adequately cover the subject matter. In the theoretical portions, it gives good summaries both of what classical authors have said and of the major points of \\"just war\\" theory. It is unfortunate that Cole seems unaware however of much of the philosophical and military work that has been done in this field in recent years. He is unaware of people like R. B. Theime, James Turner Johnson, James Toner, Nicolas Fotion, Malham Wakin, to name a few who have worked in this vain over the past quarter century.<br /><br />This book falls well short of placing the \\"Christian perspective\\" on the justification of war.  For a much better examination, I would recommend some of the works by Col. R. B. Theime, Jr., such as FOLLOW THE COLORS, WAR: MORAL OR IMMORAL, and THE CHRISTIAN WARRIOR.

Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, has written a \\"fair and balanced\\" look at some of the many ways the United States government, as well as state and local governments, have and continue to break their own laws.  It is truly fair and balanced in that this man, who many on the left would view as a conservative hack due to his affiliation with Fox News, cuts no slack on attacking illegal government activities.  This is particularly evidenced by the Judge's scathing attacks on John Ashcroft. As Americans, we tend to have a very short attention span and need to be reminded of governmental atrocities now and then.  Napolitano does just that.<br /><br />The Judge documents page after page of cases where federal, state and municipal governments have illegally exempted themselves from following their own laws.  You will appreciate the Judge's writing style as this book reads quite easily.  The book is broken down into several categories of governmental illegalities such as the misuse of eminent domain, bribing witnesses and even getting away with murder.<br /><br />Chapter 4 in and of itself is well worth the price of the book.  This chapter is on GRABBING GUNS, ENDANGERING CITIZENS and Judge Napolitano presents a rock solid case for the right to keep and bear arms by outlining numerous instances of genocide throughout the world on an unarmed citizenry.  He destroys the anti-gun argument that the Second Amendment refers only to a state militia and not to THE PEOPLE as the Amendment clearly states.<br /><br />I found Chapter 8, ASSAULTING THE PEOPLE, to be equally brilliant.  Here, Napolitano revisits the illegal activities, including abuse of power and kidnapping, of mass murderer, Janet Reno.<br /><br />The book concludes with an all too short chapter on what we, as citizens, can do to stop governmental law breaking.  My only knock on this book is that this chapter should have gone into much greater detail.

Constitutional lawyers tend to have a diffcult writing style, but it seems Perry went out of his way to make reading this book a difficult task.  He could take a very simple sentence, such as \\"The boy rode a red bycicle\\" and turn it into a monstrosity such as \\"The boy, if in fact, we can be certain, the person in question was a boy, rode, and by that I mean, he sat upon and peddeled, a red, though there are many shades of red, i.e., blood red, ruby red, fire engine red, apple red and so on - here we are talking specifically of a brite red that has dulled somewhat over time - so for our discussion here, we will call it a rusty red, bicycle.\\" You may think this a gross exaggeration, but it is not.<br /><br />Perry attempts to give justification and support to the Courts use of the Fourteenth Amendment in a wide array of social cases ranging from affirmative action to abortion.  He unconvincingly tries to make the case that the Courts have not usurped the Constitution by using the Fourteenth in reaching their decisions.<br /><br />Perry tries very hard to appear to hold a moderate view of the Courts and the Law, but his conclusions are quite left-leaning.  As with most from the left, he cannot contain himself from allowing his true agenda to rise to the top when he goes into one tirade after another lashing out at conservative judges such as Scalia, Bork, Thomas and Thayer.  As the book drearily wears on, his conclusions morph from being differing conclusions into being outright viscious attacks.<br /><br />I have given the book 2 stars because there will be a select reading audience that may enjoy, and would certainly agree with Perry's conclusions, but even those people can easily find books on the subject that are much more enjoyable and informative.nd books on the subject that are much more enjoyable and informative.	2005-01-06

The reader will see how the government has abandoned the responsibility of protecting American citizens, and done so in the name of political correctness. This book is a wake up for all Americans.<br /><br />Malkin's work illustrates, not only the ease in which illegals breech our borders, but even the minute inconvenience it is for them to stay here, even after being arrested. The total ineptitude of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is deplorable, but Malkin shows the problem is hardly limited to the INS, but reaches into all associated with securing our borders.<br /><br />Fighting terrorism is undoubtedly the cause to be rallied around by all Americans in this decade, and it must start with stopping the influx of illegal aliens into America. This book will arm you with the knowledge needed to make educated commentary to your representatives, or even to debate this perilous issue on the local level.<br /><br />See how liberal ideals and regulations have opened our borders to this invasion of illegals. Look at actual case histories of illegal felons and how easily they were able to perpetuate their crimes and how they could have been stopped and American lives saved. Find out about the rampant corruption within our government agencies and courts that have a chokehold on American security.<br /><br />I recommend a lot of books, but this is one of the few I would place on the \\"must read\\" list.

That is, until this one.  I finished this book last night and still have no idea what to write.  This book is very hard to explain.  Some people will love it.  Some people will change their thinking because of it.  And some people will absolutely hate it. There is even one group of people to which I would give this book a \\"must read\\" recommendation and that would be anyone who works within the Republican Party, such as precinct chairs.<br /><br />The book is a very easy read.  Just over two hundred pages with chapters ranging from 1 to 6 pages.  There are forty chapters in all.  The content itself is quite good, but in many instances, it left me wanting more. I believe it is a case of the author trying to put too many subjects into too few pages.  Nonetheless, what is here is very well written and there is something here for everyone.  For instance, anyone who ever considered voting for a Third party candidate should read Chapter Eleven. The author gives one of the most solid arguments for not voting Third party that I have ever heard.  There are also numerous chapters here that would benefit Democrat or swing voters, but the bulk of the content and the basic premise of the book is how loyal Republicans can help their candidates get elected.<br /><br />I live in an area where the authors' radio show is not available.  Though I have read a few of his pieces on the DAILY STANDARD website, he is largely unknown to me and I held no preconceived notions about the book. The book is well worth reading and you will gain useful ideas from it.  I do, however, have one major knock on the book.  This knock is not the authors fault. It is due to the manipulation of the English language by the press that too many Americans have adopted, and that is the author's incessant use of referring to the Democrat Party as the \\"Democratic Party\\".  There is no such thing, and there is very little that is democratic about the Democrat party.  Again, I don't blame the author for this.  You hear it everyday on every major news network.

My home library is full of American history books, but none come close to the absolute beauty of this book. To begin with, this hardcover edition uses a great quality semi-gloss heavy paper not often found. Its pages are laden with extraordinary color plates and prints.  But this book goes far beyond its external and graphic beauty.<br /><br />The writing by itself makes this book a must have for American history lovers.  The authors explain in the introduction that the book was not intended as a textbook and I believe they have exceeded their intentions.  It is, instead, a compilation of some twenty six eras or events in American history.<br /><br />For example, Chapter SIX is titled, \\"JEFFERSONIAN AMERICA\\".  This chapter's central theme is detailing the Lewis & Clark Expedition and Corps of Discovery, which is covered in roughly 20 pages of text which also includes other information such as  color maps and a 2/3 page bio on Meriwether Lewis. Other information is interjected along the way, such as a half page account of the Burr Conspiracy, details of the Louisiana Purchase, and Lewis' educational preparation for the voyage. The chapter then moves on to a short account of the Barbary Pirates and the Embargo Act before moving on to the War of 1812.  The chapter concludes, as do all the chapters, with an American profile, this one featuring James Marshall and written by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Joseph J. Ellis (FOUNDING BROTHERS).<br /><br />The American profile feature is a wonderful bonus to the book.  The authors went to obvious great effort to secure profiles from historians who are giants in their areas of expertise.  You will not find any Zinn-type revisionists here.  These authors are the real deals who tell it like it is.  Authors like Jack Rakove who writes a profile here on Samuel Adams, reconstruction era expert Eric Foner who provides a profile on Thaddeus Stevens, Harriet Tubman biographer Catherine Clinton who provides the profile on Tubman, and the aforementioned Joseph J. Ellis.  This list of authors reads like a who's who list of American historians.<br /><br />This extraordinary book coves 500 years of American history, up to and including the final chapter which covers the 9/11 attacks and the twenty-first century, in a way I have never seen presented before.

Readers will instantly notice a total lack of political correctness in Fregosi's work.  Too many writers today are scared to \\"offend\\" the reader.  You won't find that here.  Fregosi has a message to send and he lays it right out.  I'm sure many Muslims and Muslim apologists will be offended by this work, but that's okay.  Let them dispute it with facts of their own.<br /><br />Muslims and others of the anti-Christian crowd like to cite the Crusades as the beginning of the Jihad, but Fregosi blows that out of water by giving 1,300 years of examples of Jihad.  He begins by giving the reader a look into the origins of the Islamic faith.  Fregosi cuts right to the chase by exposing the Prophet Muhammad for what he truly was; a thief, a pedophile and a murderer.  I get the picture of a Charles Manson with 600,000,000 followers. He goes on to expose many of the myths perpetrated by the Islamic faith, such as the Holiness of Jerusalem to the Muslims.  We have been force fed to believe Jerusalem holds significant religious value to the Muslims because Muhammad spent time there.  It turns out, his only time there by way of a \\"night walk\\" which appears to have been little more than a 7th century acid trip.  In short, Fregosi gives us information about Islam that we will never get from the evening news.<br /><br />I don't want to give the false impression that this is little more than Islam bashing, because that is not the case.  Fregosi also goes out of his way to present two sides to this story.  When Christians and other groups wrongly treated or abused Muslims, Fregosi is quick to point it out.<br /><br />This isn't just a book about Jihad either.  This book gives the reader a basic insight into much about the Arab world that is largely unknown to western culture, such as politics, in-fighting among Arabs, social trends and much more.  I know of no other source where the reader can obtain so much information about the Muslim world in a single volume.<br /><br />As this book has been on the market for several years now, it has been condemned by many who claim it to be a work of biased hatred. To those people I would simply ask a few true or false questions.<br /><br />1) Fregosi states that Islamic Jihad against the infidels has been going on for over 1,300 years.  True or False<br /><br />2) In a March 1941 radio address from Berlin to the Arab countries, the Grand Mufti, al-Haj Mohamed Amin al Hussein, called on his listeners to \\"kill the Jews wherever you find them,\\" for, he said, \\"this pleases God, history and religion.\\" True or False<br /><br />3) Islam considers itself doctrinally a religion where destiny is to dominate and rule the world.  True or False<br /><br />4) History gives us undisputable evidence that the Prophet Muhammad was a thief, a pedophile and a murderer. True or False<br /><br />If one were able to dispute that all of these and many other statements were true, then you might be able to call this book a work of biased hatred, but they are all true statements.  If detractors chose to be obtuse about the truth and be obdurate in their belief, then that is their problem, not the authors.<br /><br />The cold, hard, non-politically correct truth is, the predominantly Christian west is at war with the Muslim world.  That war isn't going to stop in our lifetimes.  If you believe, as I do, that it is best to know your enemy, then this book is a must read.  If you think the Muslim desire to destroy the infidel was brought about by recent western interference in the Middle East, then wake up and buy this book.tics, in-fighting among Arabs, social trends and much more.

Valerie Kirschenbaum has presented a new concept in the reading, writing and publishing of books.  She introduces a new perspective for the writer to consider with their work in conjunction with the advent of super powerful home computers, printers, copiers, software, etc.<br /><br />As virtually everyone who has reviewed this book has said, it is truly a beautiful book, but it goes far beyond that.  This book imparts the idea that with the advent of home publishing and new technology, writers have more control over the finished product.  That is to say, the writer is no longer limited to turning over their hard work to a publisher only to have the work edited and printed in the standard Gutenberg black and white format.  The writer now has the power to be an integral part, or even an exclusive part in the finished product by controlling the layout, font style and color, thus making the end result more closely related to the mind's eye of the writer.<br /><br />For the reader, this concept opens up an entirely new avenue in reading enjoyment as the reader is no longer limited to the beauty of a well written story, but is now privileged to enjoy a well \\"presented story\\".  The beauty is no longer confined to the readers' comprehension but is expanded to include visual senses through the use of graphics and changes in font color and style to convey emotion.<br /><br />I'm not much of a television watcher, so pardon me if I don't have all the details, but I am reminded of a commercial I saw recently about a college professor who was lecturing on the costs and difficulty for the first time publisher.  A brash young student challenged the professor's words by introducing whatever computer technology and explaining that having your book published was no longer under the prohibitive constraints of the past.  Kisrschenbaum expands on that same concept to present a beautiful book that has broken the ice for future generations.	2004-12-13

He has written another masterpiece, this time on the often forgotten war that set the future of the Twentieth century and beyond.  Shaara deviates slightly from his usual style in that, this book is essentially two books in one.  It can be divided into three parts.  The first 1/3 of the book deals almost exclusively with the air war focusing mainly on the heroics the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen and the French born American ace, Raoul Lufberry. In the middle 1/3 of the book, Shaara introduces Gen. Pershing and a young marine private named Roscoe Templer, which begins the second book as the first concludes with the deaths of Richthofen and Lufberry.  The final 1/3 of the book focuses exclusively on the exploits and perils of the ground war.<br /><br />When it comes to the descriptive narrative of the horrors of war, I have always felt Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage set the standard.  Shaara has surpassed that standard and has broken new ground with all of his books, this one included.  Anyone who has ever served in the military will appreciate the detail of Shaara's narrative of the horrors that both the flying aces and the doughboys endured in World War I.<br /><br />As with all of Shaara's books, it is really a shame to call this a historical fiction as it is meticulously researched and historically accurate to the letter. Shaara captivates the reader by making history read like the best of literature. As with all of Shaara's books, this one is a must for the history classroom.  Of course, it will probably never see the light of day in public schools, but home-schoolers should certainly utilize Shaara's gift for putting accurate military history in the form of intriguing and captivating resources for expanding ones knowledge of the events.<br /><br />Whether you are a novice or a World War I aficionado, you will love this book.  If you have never read Shaara, this one will captivate you and have you soon reading his other fine works. You don't want to miss this book.  Add it to your library now.

Others who have reviewed this book have found something I never did.  I bought this book due to the rave reviews it has received.  I won't go so far as to say the book was a disappointment for me, but I was expecting more.  The back dust jacket praises Madden's \\"gripping narrative\\" but I couldn't find it.<br /><br />This book is laden with names, places, dates and statistics, but gives very little in the way of content.  What I mean by that is, I believe it is possible to editorialize with analytical descriptions of what took place without compromising the integrity of the event.  When you read something like \\"Army A and Army B met on this date at this place.  Army A was soundly defeated and lost X number of men.\\"  That leaves a lot of room for improvement and does little to hold the readers interest.<br /><br />Perhaps I am wrongly making the assumption that most people have a fairly basic knowledge of what took place during the Crusades, but even without that knowledge, unless someone is a history addict like me, I think most people will have a hard time staying interested in this book.<br /><br />Madden has certainly assembled a great deal of research and information, but I believe it could have been presented in a more readable and interesting manner.  There have been countless volumes written on the history of the crusades, and I believe others have provided more meaningful and enjoyable presentations.<br /><br />As far as I can find, the book is well researched and meticulously accurate, but the \\"gripping narrative\\" that I expected just isn't there.	2004-12-08

Several years ago, someone who knew that my father had once worked in the fertilizer business for Billie Sol Estes, gave me this book written by his daughter, Pam Estes.  Since the author is the daughter of Billie Sol Estes, I didn't give it much chance of being an objective and unbiased work.  Well, I recently dusted the book off and finally got around to reading it, and I owe Pam Estes an apology.  I was truely impressed with her work.<br /><br />The Estes family has long been known to be big financial supporters of Texas Democrats.  Billie Sol Estes never lost that loyalty.  I thought the author might hold that same loyalty, but found rather, that she was brutally honest.  She never paints her father as an innocent man, but successfully portrays him as a victim of Democrat backstabbing. When it became apparent that Billie Sol Estes was going down, people who had benefited greatly from his contributions and who had enabled him to do the things he had done, such as Ralph Yarborough and Lyndon Johnson were not about to go down with him.  The author even firmly suggests a theory which I have long held, that LBJ was the one man in America who had the motive, power and ability to successfully have JFK murdered without being caught. LBJ was no longer needed for the southern vote and would not have been on the 1964 ticket with JFK.  He knew that and wasn't about to lose his power.<br /><br />Pam Estes is also honest about her father's short comings.  While it is obvious that her love for her father never waivered, she lets the reader know in subtle ways, that life with Billie Sol wasn't always easy. For example, she talks about a man who had been making advances towards her mother and how those advances had gone unnoticed.  She concludes, \\"After all, if you're married to Billie Sol Estes, you don't have time for any more problems.\\"<br /><br />The story of Billie Sol Estes is not the story of a crooked Texas wheeler dealer.  It is the story about an ambitious man who found himself on the wrong side of a game of political chess.  His is the story of what kind of power and destruction is wielded by the federal government and how the government can destroy a family anytime, anywhere and for any reason.  All in all, this is a very enjoyable read.  I'm sorry I waited so long to read it.ide of a game of political chess.

One cannot be near Benjamin Netanyahu without the feeling of being in the presence of greatness. There can be little doubt, that in the annals of history, the former Israeli Prime Minister will be remembered as one of the great leaders of our time.<br /><br />In typical fashion, Netanyahu takes the reader to the point, quickly and decisively.

I choose this word because this book will inspire the reader to get more involved in actively protecting their Constitutional freedoms which have been eroded away by our federal government.  This type of book is long overdue and I commend Martyn Babitz for mapping out a plan for citizens to take action against the usurpation of our Constitutional rights.<br /><br />Mr. Babitz explains it all in plain language, illustrating how the federal government has meticulously, over time, eroded the sovereignty of the individual state republican governments.  In the first two chapters, Babitz clearly defines the limitations on the federal government set forth by the Constitution and how the federal government has overstepped those limitations.  The unconstitutionality of specific issues are outlined such as how the Supreme Court, with the aid of the unconstitutional Judiciary Act of 1789, has exceeded its jurisdiction, how the Supreme Court and special interest groups unconstitutionally take part in legislative decisions, how the Supreme Court illegally invokes the equal protection clause to strike down actual state laws that apply to all persons in the same way, as well as our unconstitutional tax system, unconstitutional federal banking system and much more.  Babitz even breaks down, in the simplest of terms, such fundamental principles as the First Amendment, \\"Congress shall make no law...\\"  Babitz explains here how state legislatures and municipalities are clearly not Congress and therefore the First Amendment should not apply.<br /><br />Mr. Babitz then looks at the three methods that have been used in the past to combat unconstitutional federal action; resolution, nullification and secession.  Resolution being the only method that has been successful, i.e. the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions against the Alien and Sedition Acts.<br /><br />The book concludes with a clearly delineated plan of action for state legislatures to take to regain state sovereignty and put an end to federal usurpation of power. An outstanding sample resolution is provided in which the reader may pattern their own resolution to be submitted to their state legislature. The Appendix includes the U.S. Constitution with all Amendments.

The book features 6 subjects: Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Each biography is in the 35 - 40 page range and goes a little deeper than a basic work.  Mr. Allen gives the reader the basic information and hits the highlights, but also delves into personal nuances and incidents of each subject.<br /><br />Each chapter is informative and enjoyable, but Mr. Allen's admiration for Thomas Jefferson shows through.  I cannot fault him for that.  If I were to commit to such an endeavor, it would surely be slanted toward the greatness of Patrick Henry.  I suppose it is most difficult to undertake such a challenge without allowing a certain amount of personal bias to show through.<br /><br />The final 75 or so pages are filler material that, unlike most filler material, is quite interesting and useful.  There is a wonderfully compiled timeline of the lives and major events of the subjects. The book is completed with a wonderful appendix which contains a section where the author debunks some of the myths propagated though the years about some of our founders.  Readers wishing to learn more about the founders are sure to find many titles to add to their reading list from the author's endnotes and bibliography.<br /><br />You will enjoy this unique book and its many anecdotes not often told about these founders.

I'd like to mention, first of all, what this book it not.  It is not for the casual observer of the American judicial system.  Justice Scalia gives a probing examination of various methods used in Constitutional and judicial interpretation. If the reader is not consumed with learning law, or delineating the intent of the Constitution, this book will probably be a major disappointment.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you have a solid foundation of knowledge on the judiciary and the U.S. Constitution, you will enjoy this book and will learn a great deal of what Justice Scalia has to offer.  Scalia offers up a 50 page paper on the various methods of judicial interpretation, each methods strengths and weaknesses, and the how and why of whether or not each method is viable.<br /><br />Scalia's paper is then cross-examined by Ronald Dworkin, Mary Ann Glendon, Amy Gutmann, Lawrence Tribe and Gordon Wood.  Scalia then offers up his rebuttal and I believe, strengthens his theories of judicial interpretation.  I am not going to go into my own how's and why's, as I am a fan of Scalia's and would rather allow the reader to reach their own conclusions.<br /><br />Whether you like this book, or hate it, one thing is for certain, you will come away with a much better knowledge of the U.S. judicial system, how it reaches some of its conclusions, and what the consequences of continuing with current methods of judicial interpretation will be on our country.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]	2004-08-17

I buy all of my books online, but this weekend, my wife had to buy a gift and we ended up at one of those trendy bookstores where you get free coffee and snacks, then pay 50% more for the books you buy.  Well, I didn't buy the book, but did read it, cover to cover.  I had not heard of this book, but picked it up and skimmed the cover, and it sounded interesting.  I got a cup of coffee and found a comfortable chair.  By the time I had finished the introduction, I knew I would either come home and order it, or else stay there all day and read it.  It turned out, my wife had other shopping to do, so I stayed there and read the book.<br /><br />I was riveted to this book from the very start. DeMuth and Stein meticulously take several mendacious claims by the liberal left and clearly dismantle each one with fact and common sense rebuttal.  Issues such as the liberal fallacy of poverty in America are broken down and shown to be little more than liberal propaganda.<br /><br />I don't know Mr. DeMuth, and have never been much of a fan of Ben Stein, but I highly recommend this fine book.  It holds the reader captivated from cover to cover.  The final chapter gives the author's summation as to how America CAN survive the liberal onslaught of misinformation and political correctness, primarily by keeping ourselves informed and educated, as well as promoting patriotism to our younger generation.  Numerous books are recommended, many of which I am familiar with and concur with the recommendations.  You should find at least one or two good titles to add to your reading list.	2004-08-16

Being a great military officer does not necessarily qualify one as a great writer. General Franks has far exceeded my expectations with this fabulous work. Though I'm sure there were ghost writers and editors who may have cleaned up his work, the end result is one for the ages.<br /><br />Having grown up on the southern plains in the Texas panhandle in the same approximate time, Franks opening chapters telling of his childhood in Wynnewood, OK and Midland, TX was both poignant and reminiscent of my own upbringing, making it most enjoyable.<br /><br />Military men of my generation will appreciate the chapters on Franks' early military years, including his boot camp with stories of the time when drill sergeants and company commanders could and did (quite regularly) use four letter expletives to convey their point to raw recruits.  As you read on, you begin to see how this man soon became a competent leader and eventually, a polished commanding officer.<br /><br />Even if you are not a military aficionado, along about page 150, about the time General Franks took command of CENTCOM, you will become consumed by this book. You will learn of both the strength and weakness of our foreign intelligence at that time.  At this same point in the book, the General is most proficient in giving candid and sometimes scathing personal analysis of key figures such as Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Clark, Pervez Musharraf and countless others.<br /><br />The second half of this book is absolutely riveting.  The reader sees the military precision and coordination of the military in dismantling the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan.  The incessant \\"Bush lied\\" battle cry is obliterated as we see one example after another of how decisions were made based on what was obviously thought to be, accurate intelligence.  We also see numerous references to the \\"liberation of the Iraqi people\\" prior to engagement.<br /><br />This is not only an outstanding book for it's entertainment value, it also serves to dispel countless attacks from the left upon our Commander in Chief and reveals a candid look into what we knew, and when we knew it, and how that information was utilized.gement.<br /><br />This is not only an outstanding book for it's entertainment value, it also serves to dispel countless attacks from the left upon our Commander in Chief and reveals a candid look into what we knew, and when we knew it, and how that information was utilized.	2004-08-10

Simon clearly sides with John Marshall in the epic struggle between our nations Third President and Fourth Chief Justice, but Simon's partiality to Marshall does not detract from the accuracy of this book.<br /><br />Readers will come away with a solid understanding of what fueled the fire of this great relationship of adversaries. Using myself as an example, I strongly disagreed with the SCOTUS' recent ruling against the Texas sodomy law in Lawrence v. Texas, and though I still disagree with the decision, I now clearly understand how Marshall set the precedent for SCOTUS to be the final arbiter for all things judicial and clearly placed the state courts into the role of subservient.<br /><br />At times, this book is rather dry, but Simon successfully imparts a good flow of information.  This book isn't for everyone, but is essential reading for the pre-law student or anyone interested in the relationship between these two monumental early Americans.  Also, for anyone who, like me, is a state's rights advocate, this book gives tremendous insight into how the judiciary became the monarchial behemoth we are saddled with today.<br /><br />Whether you are a Jeffersonian style state's rights advocate, or a Marshall style Federalist, you will finish this book with a greater understanding of how and why things became the way they are.	2004-06-30

This 200 page book is broken into seven chapters, each dedicated to a specific time.<br />I was disappointed in that I was anticipating a more indepth study of the job itself, but must say I was pleasantly surprised that this little known author did a superb job of touching lightly on a variety of topics. Having grown up in the Texas panhandle, I was pleasantly surprised to find a chapter dedicated to this sparsely populated region and the frontier towns of Mobeetie and Tascosa.<br />The Texas history buff will enjoy this book and will see a few recognizable names.	2004-06-18

If there is anything at all missing from this fine work, it would be the inclusion of some of the historic battles on the southern front such as Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse, which are regrettably omitted.  There is a group of patriots who fought in the south that we owe so much to that has been completely overlooked such as Morgan and Marion.<br />I would highly recommend this book for students, home-schoolers and just anyone wanting a good source of American historical events revolving around the Revolutionary War. You would be hard pressed to find so much information about a variety of events and people who played significant roles in our founding struggle than you will find in this single volume.	2004-06-18

I believe I have read every volume available on Henry's life, and I believe all others have used Wirt's work as their primary resource.  William Wirt spent over forty years researching for this book.<br />Being completed in 1853, this book also serves as an illustration to the fluid dynamics of the English language.  Read in its original unrevised edition, the reader may have difficulty with its frequently misspelled words and early eighteen hundreds sentence structure.  Even with my deep admiration of Henry, I had difficulty holding my focus on this sometimes quite dry read. But there is so much to learn about Henry from this work, that I would also classify this as a must read for any Henry enthusiast.<br />This book details where other works fall far short.  If you're not an ardent fan of Henry and are just looking for a good read and basic look into his life, I highly recommend David J. Vaughan's Give Me Liberty: The Uncompromising Statesmanship of Patrick Henry, but if you are looking for an indepth look at the one of the world's great orators, this is the book for you.<br />As a society, we remember Henry for his infamous and rousing Give Me Liberty speech before the Continental Congress.  This book hardly even touches on the topic, but looks instead at the Patrick Henry that most people know very little about.  His life's accomplishments are matched by few and deserve a closer look.	2004-06-18

That said, I must add, this is not Shaara's best work, but it is still a fabulous read for any lover of American history.<br />Not only does Shaara successfully depict Americas &quot;forgotten&quot; war with accuracy and color that readers have come to expect from his work, but he also gives wonderful insight in one of our most underrated military leaders with his depiction of Gen. Winfield Scott, as well as a fabulous look at the earlier career of Robert E. Lee.<br />The reader will also find glimpses of other future millitary greats in the formative stages of their careers such as Jackson and Beauregard.<br />As with all Shaara novels, it is so well researched and presented, and so historically accurate, it is really a shame to have to classify this work as historical fiction.<br />A must read for history lovers, and anyone wanting a good insight into the Mexican - American War.	2004-06-08

As far as I can tell, there is only one problem with this book. Getting the Bush-haters to read it. Many will claim this a work of bias without ever opening the book. Others will dismiss it because of David Frum himself. From his years as an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal and through the several books Frum has published, he has established himself a conservative. This means most readers from the left side of the aisle will avoid this fine book like the plague. But if you think this is just another conservative writer singing praises of the President, you couldn't be more wrong.<br />Frum has long been known to have opposed the Bush presidency. When asked to join the President's staff as a speech writer, he was at first shocked, and later quite reluctant. Throughout the book, Frum call a spade a spade. When he disagrees with something the President said or did, he tells the reader.<br />The question of \\"Who is George W. Bush?\\" is clearly delineated throughout this book. We find the author shocked to discover a man of such virtue leading the nation from the Oval Office. We see the President, not as the bumbling idiot the media and the left have tried tenaciously to portray him as, but rather as the sly, ever calculating fox that he is. We see the President as the 'right man' for leading this nation at a time when solid and relentless perspicacity is most needed.<br />The reader sees first hand, the oil and water mixture of a working relationship between Karl Rove and Karen Hughes. The leftist myths that the President is only a puppet and that Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, et. al. are truly running the nation are removed without doubt.<br />Anyone who will read this book with an open mind will come away greatly enlightened. Admirers of George W. Bush will deepen that admiration. Dissenters still will not like the President, but they will find that, though they disagree with his politics, they cannot deny that he is a good, descent, intelligent man who is trying desperately to lead America in the right direction.<br />Give this book a chance. You won't regret it.is trying desperately to lead America in the right direction. <br />Give this book a chance. You won't regret it.	2004-04-05

Not surprisingly, it closely mirrors what I learned as a student in the 1960's in Coach Woldt's Texas History classes.  The trouble is, neither one turned out to be very accurate. Sorry, Coach.  I don't have any way of knowing, but the way it reads and the information it provides the reader make it quite possible that Tinkle's work may have been used as the primary reference in Texas public school history books on lesson plans pertaining to the Alamo.<br />I shy away from writing harsh book reviews, and will say the book is an enjoyable read and gives good basic information about the account, however; the book does contain a considerable amount of unsubstantiated myths and legends.<br />Tinkle takes a good deal of liberty with things, such as this note in the Appendix:<br />Page 1. The placing of Daniel Cloud in the bell tower is the author's single assumption in this book as to the position of any character at any specific time.<br />The knowledgeable reader will find Tinkle made many such \\"assumptions\\" throughout the book.<br />The release of yet another Hollywood account of the Alamo will likely spawn renewed interest on the events there.  If you are such a reader, looking to learn more of the history of the Alamo, there are numerous more accurate sources, such as my favorite on the subject, Texian Iliad: A Military History of the Texas Revolution by Stephan Hardin, Sullivan's Fall of the Alamo, or A Time to Stand by Walter Lord.	2004-03-15

Richard Brookhiser introduces a new kind of look at George Washington, whose legacy has been all but forgotten in today's society.  Citizens today fail to realize the full scope of just how great this man was and the admiration he and his legacy received, not just in early America, but throughout the world. Even King George III said upon Washington's retirement as Commander in Chief placed him \\"in a light the most distinguished of any man living\\" and that he was \\"the greatest character of the age.\\"<br /><br />There have been countless volumes written on the man, and his tremendous legacy provides room for countless more volumes.  That said, this is not the book for someone with limited (public school system) education on Washington. Before picking up this book, you would want to read something else, such as Rasmussen and Tilton's George Washington: The Man Behind the Myths, Washington Irving's George Washington: A Biography, or even the great historical fiction by Jeffrey Shaara, The Glorious Cause, part 2 of his series on the Revolutionary War. Not that someone first learning about George Washington wouldn't enjoy this book, but it may a bit `deep' for the beginner and would be enjoyed more with a good background understanding of the subject.<br /><br />Brookhiser begins with Washington the General during the war, then moves to the drafting of the Constitution and finally, on to his role as President.  The second half of the book is dedicated to the character of George Washington.  Brookhiser gives good insight into how a man who never fathered children of his own could go on to be such a successful and admired father of a nation.<br /><br />Brookhiser gives the reader a brief look at Washington's Christianity, his proclivity of viewing life as a theatre play, and his establishment of a standard of how things are conducted in our nation's capital.  For instance, how Washington refused to turn over to the House, sensitive information regarding Jay's Treaty.  The book focuses a good bit as well on Washington's Farewell Address.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable read for anyone with a sound knowledge of the father of our country. You will surely find a few other books to add to your reading list in the extensive bibliography. Like all of Brookhiser's books, I give this one a thumbs up.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]s well on Washington's Farewell Address.

It borders on being a grave injustice to classify this monumental work as historical fiction.  It is also a rarity for a sequel to surpass the original, but Shaara accomplishes just that in this sequel to his tremendous Rise To Rebellion.  I have to place both of these wonderful books among the best I have read.<br />I call it an injustice to call it historical fiction because Shaara's work is well researched and historically accurate right down to the minute details of battlefield formations.  The only 'fictional' part is where the author has brilliantly imparted conversation between the characters, which adds to the drama and gives the reader a true sense of the character of the individuals involved. And who is to say that many similar such conversations did not actually occur? By taking the reader into the very thoughts of Washington, Greene, Cornwallis and many others, the reader is cast into a spell of compelling concern and compassion for the characters.<br />If only such fine work were implemented into public schools, our students would find interest in American history where none currently exists. Shaara presents a solid foundation to the claim that history doesn't have to be boring. Given that, I would encourage all parents to have your children learn from these fine works. These would also be a tremendous asset for the home schooler.<br />As the first volume takes the reader in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War, 1770 - 1775, this volume picks up and continues the journey through the surrender of Cornwallis and farewell of Washington to his devoted staff and eventual return to Mount Vernon.<br />Throughout the book, the reader is taken deep into the details of our war for independence.  Such details as the conditions which were endured at places such as Valley Forge.  You will feel the anger and anguish felt by General Washington as he witnessed a sentry standing on his hat to shield his bare feet from the frozen ground, while Congress and the Quartermaster Corps drug their feet on lending badly needed supplies and support. You will feel the excitement felt by Daniel Morgan as he meticulously lured Tarleton and the British into his trap at Cowpens.<br />I can go on and on about this fine book, but suffice it to say, if you only read two books this year, make them Rise to Rebellion and The Glorious Cause.  You can thank me later.e Quartermaster Corps drug their feet on lending badly needed supplies and support.

Mr. Barton's painstaking research is evident throughout this magnificent work.  I am one of those book destroyers who make personal notations in the margins and my copy is loaded with reference notes.  This book will have a permanent home on the shelf by my desk, as I am sure to reference it often.<br /><br />Barton builds an impregnable case that the current liberal assertion of church and state separation, which has evolved into an all out attack, particularly on Christianity, is far from the original intent of the founders.  Barton delves into how the anti-God crowd has distorted Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, where he mentions creating a \\"wall of separation\\", and how the left has continually assaulted the premise that America was created a \\"Christian\\" nation. Barton backs up his factual evidence with page after page of undisputable writings from our founders.<br /><br />Barton examines numerous cases of judicial decisions in early American history, which have been omitted from modern judicial opinions.  The reader follows the journey of how the anti-God crowd has meticulously destroyed the values of which our nation was founded. The reader is then presented with an insight to the religious beliefs of the founders. Barton then shows how selective history and revisionism history has been used to rewrite and ignore original intent.<br /><br />Barton concludes with a chapter on how to return to original intent that is a must read for every American.  All this in only the first two-thirds of the book!  The reader is then given nearly two hundred additional pages of appendix which includes short biographical sketches of many of the founders and other American leaders referenced in the book.  This is followed by an indepth bibliography that will add many new titles to the readers `must have' list.<br /><br />I cannot praise this magnificent book enough.  It has already earned a place as one of my most cherished reference books.  Couple this book with Michael Novak's, On Two Wings, and you will have all the necessary ammunition to challenge any argument on religion from the radical left.

Just like the great Lewis and Clark expedition, this book gets off to a slow start, but don't give up on it. It takes a while to lay the groundwork for this great true adventure in American history. And, being essentially a biography of Meriwether Lewis, it ends on the sad note of Lewis's suicide, leaving the reader melancholy at the sad ending of perhaps our greatest explorer. But what lies in between the start and the finish is a tremendous work of one of the great true adventure stories that has ever occurred.<br />The first one hundred pages are somewhat dry and tedious, but the reader finds a new found respect for the attention to detail that went into the planning and preparation for this expedition. American schools teach very little of this great event and Ambrose superbly picks up where our history classes leave off.<br /><br />The reader learns that Lewis was, in effect, a jack of all trades when it comes to being an explorer. In addition to his already polished skills as an outdoorsman, Lewis readied himself by learning medical techniques, how to properly record animals, birds and fish, as well as flora and fauna, mapping, astronomy, mineralogy, and virtually every other necessary knowledge or skill that would be helpful in making the expedition a success.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much of the book, so suffice it to say, once the expedition begins, Ambrose puts the reader right there with the Corps of Discovery at every turn. The descriptions of plants, animals, Indians and mishaps along the way are near perfection. If you have ever traveled the route, you will see in your mind, exactly what Lewis and Clark must have been seeing for the very first time.<br /><br />Ambrose has put together a true classic for every lover of American history. True life adventure is told here, only as can be told by one of Ambrose' reputation for interjecting suspense into true life events. You will not want to put down this book.	2003-09-24

Such is the case with this work by David L Hudson, Jr. Hudson does a good job of assimilating a basic guide for the novice of the American Bill of Rights, but seemed unable to abstain from injecting personal bias.<br />With a subject so dear and precious to Americans, political bias must be strictly avoided at all costs, and to the novice, Hudson quite cleverly masks that bias. However, deeper reflection reveals injected tidbits of liberal dogma. Hudson even goes so far as to cite the well known liberal revisionist historian, Howard Zinn as a reference source. Such inflection quickly discredits an otherwise credible work.<br /><br />For the student and novice, there is some good information here, but read with caution. The shameful part is, 99% of this book is very well done and successfully reflects both sides of the issue. All in all, this is a fine work and valuable to every American, especially the student.<br /><br />The first half of the book gives a brief analysis of each Amendment, their history, a brief synopsis on James Madison and simplified chapter on Amending the Constitution. The last half of the book examines each Amendment with popular legal cases rooted in each. The book concludes with the U.S. Constitution printed in its entirety.<br /><br />For a novice seeking a basic knowledge of the Bill of Rights, this book would suit nicely, but if you are looking for indepth analysis, there are other books available that would be a much better source, such as The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction by Akhil Reed Amar, or Origins of the Bill of Rights by Leonard Williams Levy.	2003-09-20

It is, as the title indicates, a primer for patriots. Whether you are a mature reader, being reminded of what you were taught in school or a member of today's educational system, reading much of this material for the first time, Milton sets the basic curricula for being a concerned citizen.<br /><br />If you're looking for an indepth analysis, you may wish to pass on this book, for you won't find that here. But then, then was not the authors intent. Part I is a basic history lesson, loosely covering events from the founding of Jamestown until September 11, 2001. The Declaration, Constitution and Bill of Rights are printed in their entirety, as well as the Emancipation Proclamation and other addresses. All this is coupled with tidbits of the Enlightenment from such notables as Locke and Montesque.<br /><br />Part II delves into immigration. Milton presents reasons behind the historical rises of immigration as well as accounts of first and second generation Americans such as John Paul Jones, Thomas Edison and Colin Powell.<br /><br />Part III goes into some of the primary problems facing America today. Milton gives a basic outline of problem as well as a common sense approach to its resolve. The reader is immediately faced with the complexity and reality of a tax code run amok when learning that the U.S. tax code has gone from an original 14 pages to an astonishing 11,760 pages. Milton then proceeds to give the reader basic knowledge on various taxing options, such as flat tax, national sales tax and value added tax. At the conclusion, random thoughts are given from prominent figures and sources, such as William Simon and the Wall Street Journal.<br /><br />A similar layout is followed in the presentation of other issues facing Americans today. Our floundering public education system, health care, the legal system, and personal economics.<br /><br />Personally, I would have liked more substance and depth, but then, it wouldn't have a primer, would it? The book would be great in the high school classroom, or for the citizen who is just developing a concern to learn more about the problems facing America today and how to handle them.

Dr. Gauss has put together a fine compilation of documents which contributed to the principles on which our nation was founded. Volume I covers the time from the Ten Commandments up to Patrick Henry's \\"Give me liberty\\" address to the Continental Congress in 1775. Volumes II & III promise to be equally compelling.<br />Dr. Gauss has meticulously reviewed each document and gives commentary on the historical context of each, followed, in most cases by key quotes from the text, then the full text of the document.<br /><br />This volume contains everything pertinent leading up to our founding. It contains such documents as The First Charter of Virginia, The Mayflower Compact, the Maryland Toleration Act, all 19 chapters of John Locke's: The Second Treatise of Government, the Cause and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, the Olive Branch Petition and so much more.<br /><br />The book would be tremendously helpful for students and teachers. It should be required reading in our schools, 'should' being the operative word.<br /><br />The Forward and Introduction will catch the reader's attention and you will not want to put this fine work down.<br /><br />The author's commentary is indispensable in laying the basic understanding for the student reading the document for the first time. Dr. Gauss does a fine job of laying the groundwork so the student will understand the necessity of the document and come away with a better understanding of its original intent. For example, in Bacon's Declaration, the author explains that Governor Berkley ruled the Virginia Colony with an iron fist in the mid-1600's and believed the citizens there to be mere \\"subjects\\" of the King. Berkley was against any sort of education for the common folk, believing it \\"dangerous\\". It is explained how rural Virginians lived without the benefit of civil defense against Indians. The readers learn of the poll tax which further burdened those without the ability to pay. So when the reader reads Bacon's Declaration, they have a good understanding of the basic climate which led to it.<br /><br />I anxiously await the publication of volumes II and III. It will be a pleasure to have a full set of such important documents from our nation's history in a 3 volume set.rther burdened those without the ability to pay.

In the same cogent style as Michener's TEXAS, Shaara manages to successfully meld fiction with historical accuracy.<br />Shaara does a fabulous job of giving life and character to the parties involved in the circumstances leading up to the American Revolution. The book begins with the events surrounding the Boston Massacre and takes the reader on a stimulating journey through the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence. Terrific insight is given to the personalities involved.<br /><br />If there is a flaw to this book, it is the authors' incessant love for the use of descriptive adjectives and punctuation. You will find hard to comprehend sentence structure on occasion. I recall sentences containing up to 10 commas and recall sentences that had to be reread to fully comprehend, but this book is definitely worth the effort.<br /><br />This is the type of historically accurate book that could be used to stimulate interest among students in American classrooms. If you want to know more about the events that led to the American Revolution, read this book. Shaara holds the readers' interest by giving personality to historical figures and you will find yourself riveted to this book.<br /><br />The featured characters of the book are Franklin, Adams, Washington and Gage, with strong emphasis on other characters such as Hutchinson, Sam Adams, Dickenson and Jefferson.<br /><br />Shaara won my admiration with this book and I will definitely be adding more of his works to my collection.	2003-03-12

We seem to be surrounded today by people who have wrongly interpreted the intentions of the nation's founders regarding religion. Novak decisively eradicates the false theories being pushed on our society, even by our own judicial system. Novak superbly presents the case that the founders intent was not to eradicate religious belief, but rather to avoid divisions of religious sentiment and find common ground among the Hebrew and Christian faiths.<br /><br />When examining the founders, many fail to recognize what life was like under the Anglican Establishment, which the founders sought to end. While being against the national establishment of a secular religion, the founder's went so far as to support the state establishment of such.<br /><br />While the first half of the book examines the intent of the founders, the second half takes a look at some of the founders who have been often overlooked by historians for their religious views.<br /><br />Overall, this book is clear and accurate. I was thoroughly impressed by the authors' research. The book reads extremely well. I only had two complaints about the book, I wished it were another thousand pages, as I absolutely did not want this book to end, and the font size was a little small, making it difficult for us old codgers.<br /><br />This is a book I will keep on the bookshelf by my desk, as I am sure I will reference this magnificent work often. I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone interested in learning the true intent behind the separation of church and state.	2003-01-31

Then read this one! I would recommend this book to every husband in America. Ronald Reagan reminds us through the cherished notes and letters he wrote to Nancy through their years together, of how a husband is supposed to treat his wife. This book leaves no doubt to the devotion and adoration shared by the former first couple.<br /><br />See inside the heart of the Great Communicator. Some of it is silly, catching moments of playful teasing, while others are hard core serious devotion to the woman Ronald Reagan truly adores. As you read through the pages of this book, you will discover yourself smiling incessantly.<br /><br />A light read with just under 200 pages, with a collections of photos, telegrams, cards and letters from Ronnie to Nancy. The book is prefaced by Nancy Reagan. This book serves to remind us not to be too busy to take to let our loved ones know what they mean to us. After all, if the President can make time to do that, can't the rest of us?<br /><br />Husbands, read this book and learn from it before your wife reads it and wishes you were more like Ronnie!	2003-01-27
