One day his daughters and son finds an injured traveler, who turns out to be of the much despised Romans.  As in many sad and tragic tales, the daughter of the Arch-druid, Eilean falls inlove with the soldier.  Of course any marriage is out of question.  So in the midst of invasions these two try to keep their \\"illegal\\" love a secret, even as she starts to go into priestess training.  This is an excellent tale of both sides of love, the happiness and the sorrow that it can bring, especially the kind looked down upon by families.  Excellent story, and worthy of Bradley's name.	2005-02-03

Those of you who made it through the trillogy were rewarded with a spectacular series about a Singer/Namer named Rhapsody, the Firbolg assassin king Achmed, and his Seargent Grunthor.  After witnessing the Rakshas terrible tragic incedent with Jo, they finally realize that the F'Dor needs to be put down.  While Rhapsody searches for the F'Dor's demon spawn children, Achmed is preparing for a possible imminant war, and Ashe is searching the country side and losing his sanity needing to give Rhapsody the memories he took from her.  Each of the scenes between him and her are gutwrenching, she wants nothing to do with him, but she must. <br /> <br />Look forward to the confrontation of the F'Dor, the call of the Cymrians, The new Lirin queen, and the leaders of the Cymrians, and a confrontation by \\"the three sisters\\" primarly Anwyn, who is not very happy with Rhapsody.  An excellent book, and end to the trillogy.  I loved Meridian, but it's hard to read the new books, knowing what will come to pass in the future.	2004-12-28

I went into reading this book not knowing it would be placed in my top five favourite books of all time.  I absolutely love it!  The story takes the character known as Shadow.  He is released from Prison awaiting to return to his love who he learns died (along with someone else...).  He meets a man known at first as Mr. Wednesday.  This man knows too much about Shadow than can be safe.  He offers Shadow a job, to work for him.  Run errands and protect him, etc.  And with that, Shadow is swept off his feet and into the midst of a war between the gods of old and the new \\"american\\" gods (ie: Media, Internet, Sex, etc...)  Along the way he is imprisioned meets many gods and goddesses, makes new friends and goes through many plot twists (even dies a few times).<br /><br />This is an exceptional book.  And one you are guaranteed to learn quite a bit about humanity and what are beliefs can do to us and others.  One other thing I loved about this book:  Every few chapters were these \\"Coming to America\\" interludes, which consisted of little stories from the beginning of time to around the 1800s.  They showed people of different cultures and religions coming to America and bringing their gods (or incarnations of the gods) with them, to a land \\"that is not good for gods.\\"<br /><br />Excellent book.  Keep it up Mr. Gaiman!	2004-11-04

I didn't know how much religion (both Pagan and Christian) that he would throw in there for us to deveour. <br /> <br />The book is about five Dominions which for the Imajica.  Earth is the fifth, the other four seem to be other parallel dimensions that were all created by the hand of the Unbeheld (God).  We learn about failed reconciliations, the bringing together of Earth and the other dominions with the City of God.  We learn that many have tried and failed at this, including Jesus the Christ. <br /> <br />We are introduced to John Furie Zacharias, a very snesual man in search of feeling all the pleasures his body can receive, he is also a painting forger.  Judith, a strong woman who is loved by two men to the point of obsession and is hunted by a hit man.  Her ex-husband who loves Judith to the point of obsession, and Pie 'oh' Pah, an assassin as well as a whore.  He is a mystif, a being who appears as whatever the seer wishes in their mind.  These and other characters become important as they explore realms outside their own as they search for the Goddesses who survived the deicide of God as well as an imprisoned Goddess who was raped by God and continued on the bloodline of god among humans.  She is held prisoner by the Tabula Rasa (a sort of religious Illuminati).   <br /> <br />And that's just beginning.  This tale weaves around everything you ever thought you new and tells the tale of what could have been in the Biblical Apocrypha and what the New Testament through Revelations would have truly been if that were the case.  By far Clive Barker's best and most ambitious novel to date.  He is the master of imagination.	2004-10-28

They seem to be old romance (old gothic) or the such.  Everyone wants more and more and that's the opposite of what he wants.  So he kills of the lead character Misery Chastain, to end the books so he can write something new.  He writes a manuscript and heads back to the city in a snowstorm, but he never makes it.  He's involved in a one man car accident and finds himself in some woman's house in a bed with broken legs and all tore up.  He;s in the home of Annie Wilkes his \\"#1 Fan.\\"   <br /> <br />This is when all hell breaks loose.  She's obsessive and insane.  She looses it when she reads the new Misery book and finds out he killed off her favourite book.  She forces him to right a new one, or die and she has him destroy his new manuscript. <br /> <br />During this time he is subjected to various tortures: fingers cut off for complaining about broken typerwriter keys.  Feet cut off for trying to escape.  And she wants to kill him and then herself once the story is finally finished, in a weird suicide love pact.  She loves him.  He hates her.  I won't reveal the ending, but it is pretty satisfying. <br /> <br />The movie was extremely good as well.  Gos read this and then watch the movie.  Very good stuff.	2004-10-21

The book takes place in Maine (as do most of King's books).  A family moves into an old house and befriend this old couple across the street.  The old man takes them on a tour of the woods and they visit the Pet Semetary (made by kids, that's why it's mispelled).  Anyways, it's mentioned that there were Indians who used to be settled up there, past the Semetary. <br /> <br />Later in the book, the family's cat dies.  The old man takes the man and the cat up to the Semetary in a pretty intense sequence of suspesful atmosphere and weird nature and inatural sounds.  He takes him to an old Indian Burial ground and there they bury the cat.  Who comes back in a few days.  Though he's been changed.  The cat acts more aggressive.  The man learns that this place resurects the dead, but a price is paid, they come back changed. <br /> <br />Then, his youngest son, only a few years old, is hit by a semi.  This starts the chainreaction that makes the man loose his mind, near enough and causes the breakdown of the family.  One by one.  Very good book and pretty scary.	2004-10-21

I would definitly read this before I bought i so I wouldn't be dissapointed.  This is a collection of interconnected Novellas.  The first story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" is easily the best.  It is the story the movie Hearts in Atlantis was pretty loosly based on.  Young Child Bobby Garfield is having a hard time as a kid growing up in the 60s.  He is a poor kid living in an apartment with his mom.  A mysterious old man moves up into an apartment above him.  He spends a lot of time with him, talking about books and the such.  This story is really about growing up, and how people change, the loosing of firends and the such.  With a supernatural twist.  King mixes in the Dark Tower and we learn a little more about the old man, he comes from that place, he's a breaker for the Crimson King.  The story is reall sad, but very good. <br /> <br />The seconf story, takes place when Bobby's childhood girlfriend goes to college.  It takes place during the Vietnam era.  There's a bunch more new characters.  The story shows two things, how a game of hearts can make many kids fail out and be drafted, and they show the protesting side.  This story was sad because Bobbies Girlfriend is not with bobby anymore. <br /> <br />The third and fourth story were pretty terrible.  They were about some of the bullies that Bobby grew up with and were darn near unreadable. <br /> <br />The fifth very short story is a tying together of loose ends.  IT brings back Bobby and his childhood sweetheart as seniors back in the old hometown.  It wasn't really that satisfying.  I would get this used or just baoorow it.  If you like it, that's great.  But I thought this was too much of a mixed bag.	2004-10-21

I never realized how interested I would become in stuff like this until the last few years.  This collection of Finish folktales, mythology, and magic and the such is a very interesting read.  Not a whole lot is known about this.  Most of the tales and legends were spread by word of mouth throughout the snowy and forest filled country throughout time.  I love reading these translations alooking at the pictures.

And it made the time between the end of Season Four and the new Miniseries that premiered 10/18/04 that much shorter.  I just wish they could make a real Farscape novel.  A story vast that went on for 600 pages or so.  That would be so good! <br /> <br />Anyways the story was really good and the author really got the characters and what they act like down pretty good.  I loved how Jon Critcton spent the whole book trying to remember the lyrics to Viva Las Vegas.  that was great.  We got Chaiana's thieving slinkyness down and D'argos anger down and Rygel's greed down.  He ends up losing Moya in  a card game and the crew must go through many twists and turns and also avoid death and imprisonment to get Moya back. <br /> <br />This was a fun book, if too short to read.  I've read it to tatters waiting for a return of Farscape. And it has come back.  If you build it, they will come.  The fans have persevered over the dorks at the scifi channel who were probably on drugs when they cancelled it.  Anyways, good book!	2004-10-18

Their mixture of the conflicting pagan and chirstian religions, history, and fantasy were nothing short of to/die/for.  I was astounded when I saw this book was being released (awhile ago).  I saw that it was actually written by Bradley's protege: Diana Paxson.  I haven't read any full novels by her (are there any?) but I have read many short stories and for the most part they range from good to excellent, so I was sort of expecting Marion Zimmer Bradley quality, unfortunately I expected too much. <br /> <br />The feel I got while reading this was that of the pulpy fantasy books ala Dragonlance series and the such.  You know the ones, where an author spews out 3 or 4 books a month in the series and the stories are all similar.  That's how I felt with this.  Plus the names, gods the names!  Some of them were okay, but Tiriki?!  Come on!  And I hate those hyphenated names, so pulp fantasy!  Feel free to add some realism to fantasy, it makes is so much better.  Another complaint was the believability of characters, especially between the Priest Micail and Preistess (groan) Tiriki.  They are husband and wife, lovers.  It is very unrealistic that they would always agree on every single issue of everything *lovingly*!  That never happens.  People are different and disagree!  Gah!  Those characters and other just seemed to be cardboard cutouts and you really didn't care about them (unlike in The Mists of Avalon). <br /> <br />And my! Final!  Complaint!!!!  !!!  Guess what it is!  It seemed about every other sentence of dialogue had an exclamation mark.  That is way to much and out of place.  It was horrific. <br /> <br />Other than that it was a decently average read.  I'm not going to throw it out or disown the author.  I'm a completist and want to have all the Avalon books.  Plus I would read it again if I want to read the series in chronological order (again).  I know Miss Paxson has the ability to write great fiction, lets just hope this was the runt  of her herd.	2004-10-11

There are a few really good stories, a lot of pretty decent ones, and a few that outright suck.  I was looking for the quality of stories from, for example, Out of Avalon.  Diane Paxton, Jennifer Roberson, etc. they are excellent authors.  There just were not many of their quality in this volume.  Plus the book was so small.  I like to have a big book filled with stories to read.  But that's just a personal preferecne I suppose and i'm not knocking off points for that.  The one missing star is due to the lack of quality in a few of the stories.  They are very well done for ametur authors, but perhaps not up to what Bradley may have desired if she were still around. <br /> <br />The previus volumes are filled with absolutely wonderful tales, let us just hope that this is the runt of the series and continue upward and onward.	2004-10-05

The game was awesome and with a story that would have taken about 3000 pages to do it justice. Not barely 200! The story was centred around the Nameless One, who they felt like giving a name, and as we remember from the game Names Are Dangerous! We see Morte, who, for the most part, stayed the same as the sarcastic little floating skull sidekick. Although he was waay hilarious in the game. Annah and Fall-from-Grace were in the book. But they were ALLL screwed up. From the game, Annah was a Tiefling theif. And Fall-from-Grace was a high society succubus. What happened? In the book, Grace was the tiefling and Annah was the sucubuss! Huh?! Plus Fall-from-Grace was only in it for like two pages! <br />  <br /> Maybe the writers should have played the game and see what kind of story they needed to live up to. With a game drenching in personal torment, life, and philosphy...it was dripping with the need of a good novel (after all it WAS a novel in game form). Maybe the makers should have made the book. <br />  <br /> Most of the important encounters were either summarized horrible or just plain taken out. Like the talk with Ravel, or the deva, Trias The Betrayer, and the FREAKING TRANCENDENT ONE, the MOST IMPOTANT NPC IN THE GAME VERSION WAS BARELY IN THIS ONE.

These short stories are very enjoyable and fun to read.  One of my favourites was the one written by Bradley herself which centred around Morgaine teaching (or trying to) this young, wild girl, the ways of Avalon.  She runs off and finds this stone which tests the courage and will of everything Morgain ever knew.  And I loved the one about Morgaine's cousin (!) who is sent from her court in disgrace to live with her because she nearly killed her brother.  She is attacked by a wolf (her and her party) and is the only survivor and meets as well as falls in love with a psycho named Myriddin (who I think is Merlin, but with maybe the welsh spelling?) He reminds me of how Merlin was portrayed in the movie Excalibur, this crazy eccentric psycho wizard.  Escapt in this story his magic is really shapeshifting abilitues.

A new telling of the love between Robin and Marian is really good.  We see how horribly corrupt Prince John is, wanting the crown for himself and willing to keep his own father prisoner or dead to do so.  The sheriff is one of the most despicable of all.  His lust of Marian destroys many around him.  He ruins the lives of those who used to be loved ones to get any attempt to just get her inti his bed.  Even though she loved Robert of Locksley (aka: Robin Hood).  Anyways, Robin wants the king back and so he and some bandits (met varius times throughout the novel) of Sherwood start stealing from noblemen such as the sheriff to pay for the King's ransom, while at the same time Marian always seems in some sort of danger, wheather its trying to get sexed up by the sheriff or being accused of witchcraft by the sheriff (because of her refusal to submit to him) or even when she was kidnapped (from the sheriff!) by an outlaw murderer (who ends up helping Robin in the end!).<br />Plus we get to see more inside Marian as she questions the womans role in that time period.  Those who \\"wait\\" for their men to return.  They are the ones to wait, worry, clean, and bear children, and submit themselves to any man.  Marian, as the novel progresses, grows a spine and begins to challenge the male society.<br />If you like this book, finish up tha story with LAdy of Sherwood.  I would also recommend Marian Zimmer Bradley's Avalon books, Arthurian and Avalon legend from female persepectives.  Very good readings.	2004-06-22

By far one of the best and wonderfully written books I have ever read.  It takes place from the birth of Elphaba (the wicked witch of the west) all the way to her death by Dorothy.  It shows a completely different side of Elphaba and understand that she was just vastly misunderstood, all the way to her sad and unfortunate ending.  <br />We also meet Glinda who starts out as a selfish stuck up brat, her turns into a more loving  and caring person after who encounters with Elphaba and the death of a teacher and back into a ditzy woman who is still nice, except she sort of betrays Elphaba at the end by giving Dorothy the only thing Elphaba would have left of her family...the ruby slippers.  And we also meet Nessarose, the religious nut who becomes the wicked with of the east.<br />I can't stress enough how well written and enthralling this read is.  I was sad at the witch's death and the end of the book.  I NEED TO READ IT AGAIN!  I would rank it right up there with the original OZ.	2004-05-24

Very well written.<br />Now I was a little dissapointed with where the story took me.  I assumed it would be mostly about Peter Lake, his love with the dying girl, and his quest to &quot;shatter time and bring back the dead&quot; as it is put.  But the story eventually leaves Mr. Lake and focuses on other people I wasn't really interested in reading about.  It was, however, a good story with what he gave us.  And I was also dissapointed with the ending Peter Lake.  Did he &quot;shatter time and bring back the dead?&quot;  We will never know because of the tacked on &quot;look in your heart and decide for yourself&quot; ending.  No, I want YOU to make an ending.  Sure, in my heart he does.  But I want to read a story about that and what happens afterwards.<br />Essentially i'm not mad about the time it took reading it.

A girl meets a man with a chrono-displacement syndrome.  She meets him when she is six for the first time and falls in love with him.  She meets him in her real time at the age of twenty, deeply in love, but he does not know her because he never met her.  He doesn't start seeing her until he's in heis thirties through time travel.  Sound confusing?  It's not really.<br />This is a fast paced, wonderfully written book filled with love, comedy, and sadness.  I'm serious it will make you laugh and will make you cry.  The ending is so sad, I had tears comming out of my eyes reading the last pages.  Definitly pick this one up, its a gem in the paper mill.  The only thing disapointing is that this is her first book and I have to wait for more!	2004-04-25
US	32654093	R3A86S5GYHBDA2	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Wow!  A New Perspective on an Old Legend.	This is a book on the legend of King Arthur seen through the eyes of the females who lived during that time.  Most of the story is told from the perspectives of Morgaine (morgan la fey), Gwenwhyfar (Guenivere, that's the welsh spelling), Viviane (the Lady of the Lake, and Igraine.  There are others, like Morgause and stuff.  But those are the most important.  The story starts when Morgaine was young and her mother Igraine was still married to the Duke of Cornwall, and the story goes from there to her and Uther's afair, Morgaine being sent to train as a preistess in Avalon, the rise of King Arthur, the incestuous night with Arthur and Morgaine which brings about his only son...which leads to many problems.  The love between Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar.  Camelot and the round table.  All of it is here.  And the story breathes new life into a lot of these.  Such as the proposal between Arthur, Lacelet, and Gwenhwyfar.<br />There is also a lot about religion in this book.  The constant battle between Christianity and the old pagan religion.  And at times, I would get really mad at these christian priests in the book who acted like *they* were higher than god himself.  I also enjoyed how the Druid Merlin was wiser about Chistianity than the priests and the prists would always resond with a &quot;The real interpretaions must be left to the priests&quot; and the like.  IT's ridiculous, especially since I know people like that for real.  <br />Anyways, if you want an exceptionally well written book about a classic legend, shown from a new perspective...pick this up.  This book now has a place in my number three spot of favourite books of all time.  Yes!	2004-03-25
US	32654093	R304R6PN8EHIYY	1400041341	205915316	Living to Tell the Tale	Books	4	4	6	N	N	The Writer in his Labyrinth	This is the first book in this famous authors autobiographical trillogy.  I wasn't sure how much I would be able to get into or like this book, due to the fact I have previously read but two of his books (100 Years of Solitude and The Autumn of the Patriarch).  But I found it very interesting and very enjoyable.  I really know where his stories of lonliness and solitude come from.  Himself and him having a hideous fear of the dark and lonliness, he put it into his writing a lot.  His dysfuctional family and friends of the family provided more interesting reading.<br />The reason this book isn't perfect is that at times it can be slow going, and hard to read.  Sometimes he jumps around in time and that can be a little confusing.  And the characters can be hard to keep track of.  I sort of agree with the guy below who suggests a character chart.  Perhaps in his following books maybe?  That would really help out.<br />All in all, I wasn't overly disappointed.  I enjoyed it and found it interesting.  I aslo liked learning that the one girl in 100 years of solitude who ate dirt was based off his sister who also had an addiction to eating dirt.  Wow!	2004-03-14
US	32654093	R16AYGM919HQMH	0871136791	11590154	Cold Mountain	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Why Must Life Be So Cold?	This was an excellent read.  It quickly made its way up to my number two spot for favourite books (Just behing Gabrel Garcia Marquez's divine prose: One Hundred Years of Solitude).  As we all know, the story takes place towards the end of the Civil War.  Inman who lived in Cold Mountain (and was in love with the Ada) is injured in war and sent to a hospital.  He eventually deserts and takes the dangerous trek back to Cold Mountain on foot.  Many adventures await both Inman, and the emotionally scarred and lonly Ada.  <br />The book is a lot more indepth and somewhat different than the movie (which I loved).  The only problem I had with the book was the lack of quotation marks.  It was sort of awkward dividing quotes with either a hyphen or nothing but a comma.  More awkward than an inconvience.  But it's not that difficult and I got used to it.<br />I would also recommend Homer's Odyssey, which Frazer loosley based this on (as well as a relative of his who fought in the civil war).  This is an excellent book and will make you think a lot about love and war.	2004-02-29

Could be the hardest I will ever read.  It is a discriptive Stream of Consciousness novel.  What does that mean?  Stream of Consciousness means that it is written as a man experiences things.  It can be erratic and all over the place, like our minds.  And sentences will and do go on for pages upon pages.  One of the hardest things to get into.  But if you do it, the rewards are great.<br />This book is about a cruel dictator of a small Carribean island.  He is at the end of his life and is trapped in his own personal coutry ruled over by a cruel dictator.  He is in his own personal hell.  It is a very intense story, some of the things he does and has done can utterly disgust you, but you know that there is a small chance this man could find redemption.  And on and on through the story, you begin to feel sorry for this cruel, horrible man.<br />The description of this novel is great.  I would reccomend this book only after you have read perhaps more than two of his books (unlike me) and perhaps other &quot;difficult&quot; books.  The book is only a little over 200 pages, but could take longer than reading The Odyssesy.<br />All in all, another masterpiece by Mr. Garcia.  I think he should get special recognition for this work.  Both the story and the style are perfected.  Good job!	2003-12-01

This is the first books of the Abarat series written by the master Clive Barker.  He also includes illustrations which were oil paintings that he himself created.  <br />This book, being written for young adults, can be read by both young as well as old.  It is that good!  If you want to get in on the next best thing (after this Harry Potter stuff) read this book.  The start of an epic classic!	2003-11-18

I rank it up there with the Dark Tower books and The Talisman, as his essential novels.<br />This is about the lonely empty mining town Desolation, in Nevada.  And the many people who are forced together under unfortunate and terrible circumstnaces.  You see, Collie Entragien is a psycho cop (who is possessed by Tak, a demon).  He stops passersby and forces them into this dead town.  <br />And thus starts the epic battle between God and Satan.  Through the power of their faith and belief (and the little boy who holds most of it), most of these prisoners are able to overcome their foe from hell.<br />This book is very well written, suspenssseful, and entertaining.  The author proves that even hacks themselves can have classics.  And this is one of them.	2003-11-18

Written by the master himself; H.P. Lovecraft.<br />My favourite: The Colour Out of Space; is about a meteour that falls and hits a town.  The area around the crash begins to change, and so do the people living near it.  Something is living in the well...but what?  Very very scary.  I couldn't drink my water for awhile after reading it.<br />The Call of Chuthulhu is probably his most well known story in hear.  The very start of the Chuthulhu Mythos.  The biggest fan fiction ever.<br />His stories are very ambient and usually have the discovery of some horrible, anicent, arcane, heretical thing of old; be it god or altars.  Very scary stuff indeed.<br />If you want to read some horror that WILL scare you other than the latest pulp crap that some hack wrote in a week.  Get this book.  If only In the Mountains of Madness were in this collection.  Then you would need no other.	2003-11-13

Two people who come together.  Cal, who lives with his depressed dad and pigeons.  And Suzannah who travels from England to at the wish of a cryptic note from her Grandmother she barely knew.  She finds her on her death bed.  These two are brought together during a run in with a human salesman and the incantatrix Immacolata, who is using the salesman for her will.  They are after a carpet.  A carpet that houses the Seerkind.  Immacolata was once one of them, but she escape now she want them destroyed.<br />And so the story goes from there.  Suzannah (who receives part of Immacolata's menstruum, and thus some of her powers), and Mad Mooney must get this carpet back from those two eveil people.  They are met by a few stragglers from &quot;The Fugue&quot; who help (and don't help) the two on their journey.  This is an epic fantasy novel that could rival classics like The Riftwar Saga and The Lord of the Rings.<br />Clive Barker uses his masterful writing to paint us a beautifl image of England as well as The Fugue, the two places that most of the story is told in.  And the words all weave together to tell this wonderful story.  And if reading that last three paragraghs doesn't bring a tear to your face as you finally close this chapter of the adventure, I don't know *what* will.<br />You owe it to yourself to pick this wonderful book up and give it a read.	2003-11-12

It is wonderfully written (and translated)and beautiful.  It wasn't difficult to read like some books and really kept me going.  I'm really interested in checking out some of Garcia's other works.  <br />This story is definelty *not* for the humanist or the easily depressed.  There is a lot of sorrow and torment throughout this whole novel.  I found I had to stop reading when I got to the part about the Italian man who commited suicide because the love of his life refused to *ever* marry him, even though she loved him and her denial was just a weird game of torment she was playing with him.  My explaining it does not do that part justice.  It was truly sad... and I had to stop reading right there.<br />I recommend this book to everyone.  It is a wonderful books to start expanding your horizons away from al ot of the pulp novels and mass market paperbacks with nothing learned and nothing gained. <br />This books will teach you a lot about our secret condition.	2003-11-06

I absolutely loved the Talisman and the dark Tower books thusfar (the only worthy books by Stephen King).  I was looking for another fun adventure through the Terriritories suitibally after the Talisman ended (we all remember the very end of it).  But so long after the last book...it doesn't wasn't a fun read.  And does King have to insert the Dark Tower into EVERYTHING?  Sure, the novelty was ok the first few times it appeared in his stories...but repeatedly?  Over and over again?!  Absolutley NOT!  This shows he's running out of material fast.  If you want to read king read his Dark Tower Series and The Talisman.  If you have read those, wait for Wolves of the Calla, the 5th Dark Tower book and then wait for the rest. <br />Hopefully he keeps his promise of retiring after he has completed his Dark Tower Books.  And hopefully he keeps his eyes on the real project and does not stray into other books like he has been doing.	2003-10-28
