He later founded Airvision which is one of the world's leading developers of integrated brand positioning, strategic growth, retail design, and operations. In short, a powerhouse in retail and merchandise. Collins Hemingway is probably best known as co-author with Bill Gates of 'Business @ the Speed of Thought'.    This book is split in four parts, which each consist of 2-to-7 chapters. Each of the four sections covers a major aspect of retail strategy, following the order of business growth. \\"The book describes a new way of thinking about retail, an approach that embodies strong personal values, creativity toward concept, an artistic approach to design, a scientific methodology in finance and market analysis, and `old-time' customer service that seeks to personalize the experience.\\" The book introduces a three-step approach that ensures the right combination of creativity and discipline. The holistic approach is to ideate, create, and execute, or as Rubinfeld expresses it - `ideatecreateexecute'. \\"Each problem and opportunity begins with ideation, follows with creation, and concludes with execution.\\"    Part 1 - Make No Little Plans - is the largest part of the book and consists of 7 chapters. The first chapter discusses the link between \\"strong, core personal values and business values\\" and the complex subject of \\"brand\\", whereby it is important to note that \\"for retailers the store experience is the brand.\\" It is emphasized that each new concept begins with idea generation (or ideation) which has to be on core value(s). These core values lead to corporate values, which lead to produce and store values, which leads to store branding, which lead to corporate branding, which reinforces corporate values, or \\"a self-perpetuating wheel of value, action, and perception.\\" The next step in developing a concept is to ideate on the possibilitiesin the broadest possible way. Rubinfeld believes that the 2 most important steps toward differentiation are to make the concept both `authentic' (to ensure a niche) and `on trend' (to provide a customer base). \\"The first store should always be able to ground you in the values that first established your concept and your brand\\", whereby the two most critical elements are location and the presentation of store design. The third chapter concentrates entirely on the issue of locationing, which defines real estate in terms of branding. The proper design of the store completes the claiming of a powerful brand position through the physical manifestation of the brand and the fourth chapter takes you through the many design considerations. The fifth chapter provides a short discussion on the connection between design and brand, or the creation of a place where the customer wants to be. The following chapter introduces the first step in the art of merchandising, which \\"is to get the customer to notice you and take the first step ... into the store!\\" The brand must register and connect with the customer; it must strive to engage all five human senses. There are extremely useful guidelines at the end of the chapter on retail merchandising. The final chapter of this part focuses on customer service. \\"Customer service has a simple underlying premise: Put yourself in the customers' position.\\" Rubinfeld provides fantastic advice on customer service and I could easily come up with 20 quotes from this relatively short chapter.    The second Part - Go Long - consists of 4 chapters and builds on the foundations introduced in the first part. The \\"go long\\" refers to the American football phrase, which means to throw long passes in an effort to move the ball downfield, score quickly, and demoralize the opposition. \\"In retail business, `going long' is a strategy designed to rack up points (profits) and quickly put the game out of reach of would-be competitors.\\" The first chapter focuses onthe strategic plan for the business should ideally be done during the creation phase. It does not have to be detailed and is best structured as a PowerPoint presentation (bullet points): Section 1 should begin with core values, mission statement, three-word mantra, and an analysis of competitive differentiation; section 2 should outline the strategic initiatives and strategic objectives; section 3 should describe a store development plant that implements the strategic objectives; and section 4 should review the financial results of the planned expansion, broken down by best, average, and worst case. This process should be reviewed on an annual basis. There are some useful questions to ask whether to ask before `going long'. The next chapter discusses the building of a team that can help the concept to `go long', whereby exceptional focus needs to be on matching motivation with values. The third chapter explains how you to `kick the economic model into gear' since it has to be robust enough to generate excess cash to power expansion. In the final chapter of this part each of the different options to expansion are discussed.    The third part - Own Main & Main - refers to an expression used at Starbucks' (\\"corner of Main & Main\\") to describe any urban street corner that offered high customer traffic counts, great visibility, and high-quality co-tenacy. Starbucks made use of a database report of potential markets, using high income and large population size as the primary criteria. This database report was combined with additional statistics, such as length of education (13+ years), to define top two market tiers. In the first chapter there is also a discussion on the hub-and-spoke expansion model. In the next chapter the authors focus on hot spots, oil stains (which refers to locations where lots of cars park), and the perfect location. The following chapter provides detailed examples of financial comparisons to ensure that the proposed location(s) will generate thenecessary return on investment. After you have found the right property, you have to be able to lease if for a reasonable sum. \\"Real estate dealmaking is about `who needs who more, when'.\\" This chapter is quite extensive since Rubinfeld has massive experience on this subject and introduces lots of possibilities.    The final part - Push the Envelope - shows how a retailer can maintain brand leadership over time. The phrase refers to the testing of high-speed aircraft, which predicted performance frequently takes the shape of a rectangular box. \\"Pushing the envelope requires constant innovation\\" and its lesson is two fold: Risk is necessary for reward and the risk must come as part of an overall plan. Rubinfeld also discusses in detail the 3 requirements of innovation, (1) license, (2) timing, and (3) demographics. Rubinfeld explains that retail is more than a job to him: \\"It is a mission... I am a brick-and-mortar guy... Most of all, retail has the one thing that no other company has ... the constant flow of people, of interaction in the flesh.\\" He uses the final chapter to discuss the future challenges in the retail industry and provides some useful answers to these challenges.    Yes, this is a great book on retailing. Obviously, Rubinfeld uses his extensive experience with Starbucks to describe retailing and merchandising. Yes, there is a strong focus on growth and expansion which might not suit every mom-and-pop retailer. However, I do believe that this book also caters for them and provides useful advice on strategy, locationing, branding, pricing, and merchandising. It is full of great examples and the chapters can be used as checklist on the individual subjects. I do believe that the first chapter of the second part - Blueprint for Execution - is possibly the most important one since it puts everything else into context. Just remember to review that chapter on a yearly basis. Let's also hope that your competitors do not read this book before you do!	2005-10-05

Drucker was born in 1911 and is the Grandmaster in the field of management. He is the most influential thinker on this subject of the 20st century and has published mountains of books and articles. (In short, he is \\"the man\\"!) This book, which is based on 18 months of research and study of the General Motors Corporation, was originally published in 1946. It consists of 4 parts (`chapters'), each consisting of 1-to-5 chapters (which Drucker gives numbers and titles.) <br /> <br />This `Transaction' edition includes an additional 1993-introduction and an additional 1983-preface, in which Drucker discusses the impact of this landmark-book. \\"Concept of the Corporation is credited with having established management as a discipline and as a field of study.\\" However, the does not completely agree: \\"It established organization as a distinct entity, and its study as a discipline. ... And Concept of the Corporation thus became the first attempt to show how an organization really works and what its challenges, problems, principles are.\\" He also discusses the fact that his book was not well received by the people of General Motors, which was at the time of the original publication the undisputed worldwide leader in the automobile industry and the world's biggest manufacturing company: \\"And a main reason, I now realize, was precisely that I treated General Motors (GM) as a prototype, as an `organization', and its problems therefore as problems of structure, if not of principle, rather than as the way GM does things.\\" <br /> <br />The first part of this book - Capitalism in One Country - consists only of 1 chapter and sets the background scene for his study. It discusses the belief of the American people in a free-enterprise economic system, the interrelationship between industrial society and \\"Big Business\\" (which Drucker terms `corporation'), whereby in the early 20th century the large corporation had become America's representative social institution, and the social and political analysis of an institution. This analysis has to take place at three levels: The corporation has to \\"be organized in such as way as to be able itself to function and to survive as an institution, as to enable society to realize its basic promises and beliefs, and as to enable society to function and to survive.\\" <br /> <br />The second part of the book - The Corporation as Human Effort - consists of 5 chapters and discusses GM's relatively modern organization model. In the first chapter the first law of the corporation/institution is detailed, which is \\"to produce goods with the maximum economic return.\\" But Drucker is quick to emphasize that the essence of the corporation is social, that is human, organization: \\"... modern production ... is based on principles - organization not of machines but of human beings.\\" He continues with the consequences of this fact, the dependence on the solution of the three interdependent problems: \\"The distribution of power and responsibility, the formulation of general and objective criteria of policy and action, the selection and training of leaders - these are the central questions of corporate organization.\\" In the second chapter GM's basic and universally valid concept of decentralization is described. So how well does decentralization work? This is discussed in the third chapter, whereby the conclusion is mostly positive. The fourth chapter is a very unusual one, it discusses the relationship between big business (GM in this instance) and its small business partner (the automobile dealer). Drucker realizes that GM has very well established principles, which are primarily based on the resolution of conflicts in harmony. However, with respect to the big-small business relationships, there is still a lot of work left to do in other branches of America's economy. In the final chapter, the question is asked whether decentralization can be used as a model. In GM decentralization is not seen as a technique of top management, but as a basic principle of the industrial order. <br /> <br />The third part of the book - The Corporation as a Social Institution - consists of 3 chapters. The first chapter starts off with a discussion on American beliefs in which, Drucker believes, the corporation plays a large role. \\"It is characteristic of the American tradition that its political philosophy sees social institutions as a means to an end which is beyond society.\\" He explains the impact this (the promise of justice or of equal opportunities and the promise of status and function as an individual) has on the corporation, which was still a relatively new phenomenon in the 1940s. He discusses opportunities, dignity and status, assembly line \\"monotony\\", unionism. The second chapter describes the new industrial middle class of \\"foreman\\" who, through the introduction of big business, now lacks equal opportunities as well as status and function. In the third chapter Drucker emphasizes that the bad relations between labor and management in the automobile industry provide the perfect example to discuss \\"the absence of a workable solution of the twin problems of equal opportunities and of status and function of the worker\\". This study took place during war and post-war years and the differences in the relationship between labor and management during these 2 periods are extremely well exposed. There are some great comments with respect to labor relations and the so-called \\"wage issue\\". <br /> <br />The final part of the book - Economic Policy in an Industrial Society - consists of 3 chapters. The first chapter has the strange title of The \\"Curse of Bigness\\". First the relationship between corporation and society is discussed. \\"Whatever the terminology, the large corporation is a tool and organ of society\\" and \\"modern industrial society must organize its economy in the large units of Big Business.\\" It is important to note that Drucker in 1946 already recognizes that \\"bigness\\" in itself is not in conflictwith the requirements of social stability and social functioning. The second chapter also has a strange title - Production for \\"Use\\" or for \\"Profit\\" - which sounds like both a contradiction and a conflict in one sentence. Drucker notes that \\"Production for Profit\\" is the principle of rationality and efficiency on which the corporation must base itself and that the demand \\"production for use\\" thus asserts a conflict between the needs of society and those of the corporation. He discusses the profit motive, the lust of power, and the market before turning to social needs and the individual wants. The final chapter covers the touchstone of America's economic system and the focus of economic policy, which full employment, and touches upon some of the greatest challenges to government and business. \\"The first problem of a full-employment policy is to generate capital-goods production during a cyclical depression.\\" In the short section on the employment fund Drucker really that he is almost 50 years ahead of his time. There is also a magical piece on the \\"five pillars on which an economic policy for a free-enterprise society rests.\\" <br /> <br />This edition also includes a 1983 epilogue, which discusses the impact of this book. \\"Concept of the Corporation had an immediate impact on American business, on public service institutions, on government agencies - and none on General Motors!\\" It explains the main reasons for why the book was totally unacceptable to most GM executives, and above all to Alfred Sloan. Drucker mentions the accompanying letter, in which he urges for \\"serious reconsideration of a number of other GM policies, precisely because they had been successful for twenty years.\\" I would like to see the accompanying letter included in future versions of this book. <br /> <br />I find it incredibly difficult to review books by Peter Drucker, you always feel that you let the `Master' down. This book is a true classic and I am happy that I finally made time to readit. (Yes, yes, I should have done years ago.) I believe that it gives a great insight of the position of Big Business in society, whereby General Motors' policies, which was at the time the world's largest manufacturing company, are used as an example. However, readers interested in just GM itself are better served by Alfred P. Sloan's autobiography `My Years with General Motors'. Even 60 years after its original publication date the book is still very relevant and Drucker shows his credentials as visionary. The book is not just relevant for business people; it is also useful for people involved in government and policy-setting. (This book deserves six-stars, fantastic!)	2005-10-01

Marc J. Epstein has been a visiting professor and visiting scholar at Harvard Business School, a distinguished research professor at Rice University's Jones Graduate School of Management, and has also served at a professor at Stanford Business School and INSEAD. Robert Shelton is Managing Director of Navigant Consulting's Innovation practice, and has served as VP and Managing Director with Arthur D. Little and as Managing Director of the Technology Management practice at Stanford Research Institute. One word of warning: This review is slightly longer than I wish. <br /> <br />The authors use 10 chapters in this book to explain that innovation is about good innovation management. \\"This book challenges the prevalent misconceptions about innovation, and lays out the tools and processes necessary for an organization to harness and executive innovation.\\" Chapter 1 - Driving Success discusses the fact that superior innovation can provide companies the opportunities to grow faster, better, and smarter than their competitors or even influence the direction of an entire industry. It is important from the outset to keep in mind the fundamental tenet of innovation \\"How you innovate determines what you innovate.\\" The authors introduce the \\"Seven Innovation Rules\\", which are each discussed in detail: 1. Exert strong leadership on the innovation strategy and portfolio decisions. 2. Integrate innovation into the company's basic business mentality. 3. Align the amount and type of innovation to the company's business. 4. Manage the natural tension between creativity and value capture. 5. Neutralize organizational antibodies. 6. Recognize that the basic unit (or fundamental building block) of innovation is a network that includes people and knowledge both inside and outside the organization. 7. Create the right metrics and rewards for innovation. Obviously none of these rules are new, but the authors argue that they are interdependent and that mastering just one or two will not take an organization far enough. <br /> <br />The second chapter discusses that fact that high-performing companies innovate by leveraging both new business models and improved technologies, whereby six levers of innovation are identified. Not all innovations are created equally and the generic types of innovation include incremental, semi-radical, and radical. Each of these levers and generic types of innovation are discussed in detail. The third chapter builds on the conclusion of the second chapter and explains that the innovation strategy must support the overall business strategy. \\"Without a clear game plan, and without alignment of the key players in the organization, you cannot be very successful at innovation.\\" The authors make a distinction between play-to-win and play-not-to-lose strategies, which depends on the center of gravity and diversity of the investment within the innovation matrix. They further discuss the internal and external factors to consider in choosing an innovation strategy and risk management with relation to innovation strategy. <br /> <br />The fourth chapter discusses the fact it is not enough to choose a strategy, but that it has to be build and embedded into the overall organization. Within this chapter there are discussions on the development of an internal marketplace for innovation, the outsourcing of innovation, the integration of innovation within the organization, and the leadership role. There is a very useful action plan for the CEO (this surely means senior management?) in order to improve the innovation organization. In the fifth chapter the authors focus on the mechanisms by which innovation (and the other tasks of organizations) gets done. \\"Innovation systems are established policies, procedures, and information mechanisms that facilitate the innovation process within and across organizations.\\" These innovation systems fulfil five important roles: increase the efficiency, appropriate lines of communication, coordination between projects and team, learning, and alignment of the objectives of the various constituencies. They continue to discuss the choice and design of innovation systems, compare management systems, and electronic collaboration. The sixth chapter has a strange title - Illuminating the Pathway. It refers to measuring innovation, which is both fundamental and critical to innovation success. Although the authors recognize the strength of the old saying \\"What gets measured gets done\\", they also recognize its weakness in that many companies measure far too much. They discuss the three roles of measurements systems (plan, monitor, and learn), a balanced scorecard for measuring innovation, the design and implementation of innovation measurement systems. In addition, they also discuss the barriers to effective performance measurements. \\"Measurement is one of the most significant factors in successful innovation. Ironically, in many organizations, it is one of the least attended to.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Incentives and rewards are some of the most powerful management tools available.\\" This is the subject of Chapter 7, which is probably also one of the most controversial issues going around today. Following a short discussion on motivation the authors turn towards incentive systems' design, which should reinforce a company's innovation strategy. They also discuss goals setting, performance evaluation and incentive contracts, and the key considerations with respect to designing incentives systems. Chapter 8 focuses on learning innovation, since the ability to learn faster, better, and more cheaply can mean the difference between market leadership and barely surviving. Learning in an innovative organization has these characteristics: Specific processes for learning and change link to strategy; a systems approach; shared vision; flexibility and agility; anticipation of challenges and threats; and collaborative but challenging environment. The authors then continue with a discussion on the two major types of learning (`learning to act' and `learning to learn') and the interaction between systems and the learning process. The penultimate chapter discuss how culture affects innovation, whereby it is important to note that culture is not static and continually evolves just like innovations and markets. \\"[Innovation] can be a vital source of competitive energy as well as an energizing force for the people in the company.\\" However, according to the authors, the biggest threat to innovation is success which can result in complacency and dogma. They continue with a discussion on the organizational levers of an innovative culture, differences in country cultures which breed innovation cultures, and the very important role of senior management on innovation (with special responsibilities for the CEO!). <br /> <br />The final chapter serves as a conclusion and discusses how you can apply the innovation rules to your organization. Although some people might disagree, the authors believe that \\"successfully executing improvements to innovation is relatively straightforward\\", with the 7 innovation rules provide the basis for effective execution. The authors make conclusive remarks about the role of leadership (\\"... the crucial difference in creating and sustaining successful innovation\\"), the available diagnostics and action, and the organization of initiatives. One important thing to keep in mind is that \\"no formula or structure for innovation that will work for every organization.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, I do like this book. It provides a more structured approach to the somewhat `mythical' field of innovation. I believe that the strength of the book is that the 7 innovation rules can provide a checklist/basis for the innovation approach, whereby the various chapters give background information and guidance on the individual rules. There are lots of useful figures, diagrams and tables with each chapter. I highly recommended this book to people who want to revitalize their organizations (and also want some control of this effort).	2005-09-22

Roberto is a faculty member at the Harvard Business School, where he also earned an MBA with high distinction and a doctorate. This book was published in 2005 and consists of 4 parts, each consisting of 1-to-3 chapters. There is also a preface which serves as an introductory chapter. <br /> <br />Part I - Leading the Decision Process - consists of 2 chapters and introduces a conceptual framework for thinking about how to diagnose, evaluate, and improve strategic decision-making. In the first chapter the author explains why leaders should cultivate conflict and consensus simultaneously as well as why they typically find it very difficult to achieve this objective. In the second chapter, Roberto describes the implicit and explicit choices that leaders make to shape and influence how the decision process unfolds. Through these process choices, leaders can create the conditions that enable them to manage conflict and consensus in a constructive manner. <br /> <br />The second part, which consists of 3 chapters, focuses on the task of Managing Conflict. In Chapter 3 the author describes the factors that inhibit candid dialogue and debate in organizations. It distinguishes between \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" barriers that block the discussion of dissenting views. \\"Hard\\" barriers consist of structural aspects of the organization, such as demographic composition of the senior management team, the complexity of reporting relationships, and ambiguity in job/role definitions. The \\"soft\\" barriers comprise things, such as differences in status, the language system used to discuss failures in the organization, and certain taken-for-granted assumptions about how people should behave. The following chapter explains how leaders can stimulate heightened levels of conflict in their firms and provides a variety of mechanisms and practices, including their strengths and weaknesses, which leaders can use for this purpose. In the final chapter of this part, Roberto offers a set of toolsand strategies which leaders can use to keep conflict constructive (\\"disagree without being disagreeable\\"). <br /> <br />Part III - Building Consensus - concentrates on the creation of consensus within organizations without compromising the level of divergent and creative thinking. The author first discusses the dynamics of paralyzed by indecision, which can make the life of leaders extremely difficult. He then turns to the 2 building blocks of consensus: procedural fairness and legitimacy. It discusses methods and processes in which leaders can get people to co-operate even when they disagree with the final decision. The final chapter of this part addresses how leaders can move to closure during a contentious set of deliberations. There is a section on the management of the interplay between divergent and convergent thinking in order to bring timely closure to a decision process. This chapter introduces an approach/model of seeking \\"small wins\\" at various points during a complex and perhaps controversial decision-making process. <br /> <br />The final part of the book - A New Breed of Take-Charge Leader - consists of just one chapter, This chapter reflects on the book's philosophy of leadership and decision-making, which differs fundamentally from conventional views held by managers. Roberto distinguishes 2 approaches to \\"taking charge\\" when confronted with a difficult decision. In the traditional approach, leaders provide solutions to their organization's problems (the \\"take charge\\" and act decisively-approach). The alternative approach calls for leaders to take an active role shaping, influencing, and directing the process by which their organizations make high-stakes choices, without micromanaging the content of the decision. This latter approach entails a disciplined focus on how choices are made, not simply what the organization should do. <br /> <br />Yes, I do like this book - although I think that the title is misleading and somewhat \\"cheesy\\". The book discusses improvements to decision-making through the management of conflict and consensus in this process. The reasoning used in the book is based on sound research, whereby it useful to know that the author has massive academical credentials. I believe that the strength of the book comes from reminding us that successful management of conflict can result in better decision-making. The book also includes good advice on how to manage this conflict, which people often try to avoid and results in weak decisions. Highly recommended to managers and people interested in decision-making.	2005-09-16

He was Professor of Organizational Anthropology and International Management at the University of Limburg (which was later re-named Maastricht University). He is the founder and first director of the Institute for Research on Intercultural Cooperation (IRIC), where a lot of the research used in this book comes from. This paperback version was published 3 years after the hardcover and includes some updated references to political events. This book is largely an extension to Hofstede's 1980-book `Culture's Consequences'. The book consists of 4 parts.<br /><br />Part I - Introduction, consists of one chapter, and lays the foundation for the remainder of the book by introducing the meaning of `culture' and a small vocabulary of essential terms. He also discusses the objective of the book: \\"to help in dealing with the differences in thinking, feeling, and acting of people around the globe. It will show that although the variety in people's minds is enormous, there is a structure in this variety which can serve as a basis for mutual understanding.\\" With reference to the definition of culture, we need to understand the book's subtitle first. `Software of the mind' is patterns of thinking, feeling and acting (which were learned throughout a lifetime). Hofstede's definition of culture is \\"the collective programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from another.\\" It is important to note that he believes that culture is learned and not inherited. He continues with a brief discussion on the 3 levels in human mental programming: 1. Human nature (universal; inherited); 2. Culture (specific to group/category; learned); and 3. Personality (specific to individual; learned and inherited).<br /><br />Part II - National Cultures - is the largest section of this book with 6 chapters and deals with differences among cultures at national levels. Chapter 2-to-5 describe the four dimensions empirically found in research across more than 50 countries: (1) to wit power distance; (2) collectivism versus individualism; (3) femininity versus masculinity; and (4) uncertainty avoidance. Each of these 4 chapters follows the same structure: description of dimension, the scores of the various countries, the consequences of the dimension for family life, school, workplace, organization, state, and the development of ideas. Chapter 6 looks at the consequences of the national culture differences in the way people in a country organize themselves, combining the dimensions from the previous chapters. The next chapter introduces a fifth cross-national dimension, which is long-term versus short-term orientation. This reveals deep differences between Eastern and Western thinking.<br /><br />Part III deals with differences in organizational culture and consists of only 1 chapter in which the author describes the insights collected in IRIC's research project across 20 organizational units in Denmark and the Netherlands between 1985-1987.<br /><br />Part IV - Implications - consists of 2 chapters and discusses the practical implications of the culture differences and similarities. The first chapter of this part discusses what happens when people from different cultures meet. It discusses phenomena, such as culture shock, ethnocentrism, stereotyping, differences in language and in humor. It also discusses the development of intercultural communication skills. The final chapter of the book summarizes the message of the book and translates it into suggestions for parents, managers and the media. There is also a speculation on future political developments, based on the cultural processes.<br /><br />Yes, this is a monumental book on the `software of the mind'. I believe that this book is a fantastic piece of work on this subject, based on strong research, and is probably the starting point for anybody interested in this subject. I must warn people that the book is not a simple, fast read, since the information is very intense and the wide range of information covered. However, the writing style is good and there are plenty of tables, diagrams, figures to make the reading somewhat `easier'. Highly recommended to all people interested in this subject, from parents through to managers.

Mischkind is Senior Vice-President, and Michael Meltzer is Managing Director and General Counsel at Sirota Consulting. All authors have impressive credentials to their names, ranging from doctorates through to directorships at IBM. This review is slightly longer than my usual ones. <br /> <br />This 2005-hardcover version is split up in 5 parts, consisting of 1-to-4 chapters each. There are also 5 proper appendices, which contain the statistical evidence for the claims made in the book by the authors. In the extensive introduction the authors discuss the background, research and set up of the book. <br /> <br />The first part of the book - Worker Motivation, Morale, and Performance - consists of 2 chapters. In the first chapter the authors assert that there are three primary sets of goals at work: Equity, achievement, and camaraderie. They term these \\"our Three Factor Theory of Human Motivation in the Workplace\\" and maintain that \\"these three sets of goals characterize what the overwhelming majority of workers want.\\" In the second chapter the authors ask the question: \\"what does employee enthusiasm have to do with business success?\\" The authors believe that higher morale of their workers is one of the key characteristics of companies that have experienced long-term success. The term `enthusiastic' is introduced in order to elevate superior overall satisfaction scores, since they are just more than moderately satisfied, and organizations with enthusiastic employees are much higher performing organizations than the rest. <br /> <br />The second part of the book - Enthusiastic Workforces, Motivated by Fair Treatment - consists of 3 chapters and discusses the first of the Three Factor Theory, the concept of equity. In the first chapter of this part the authors tackle the issue of job security which \\"is a defining characteristic [of a company] because a decision to lay off people sends a message to the workforce about the way the company views its people: assets or as costs (necessary evils).\\" In the second chapter the authors discuss compensation, which is also extraordinarily important for worker morale and performance. There is a short piece on money as seen from a worker's and an employer's perspective. The final chapter of this part discusses respect, which is the major non-financial component of equity. The kind of respect the authors have in mind is \\"from a sense of the intrinsic worth of human beings - all human beings.\\" Equality through the treatment of each individual is at the heart of respect, but the core issue is how higher income and power level individuals treat individuals at lower levels. <br /> <br />Part III - Enthusiastic Workforces, Motivated by Achievement consists of 4 chapters and discusses the second of the Three Factor Theory, the concept of achievement. The authors discuss a critical condition for employee enthusiasm, which is a clear, credible, and inspiring organizational purpose, or a \\"reason for being there\\". There is an important piece on translating words into deeds, whereby discuss 3 reasons for not implementing formal purpose/mission/vision/values statements. The second chapter discusses the business practices that enable people to get their jobs done well. \\"A high degree of perceived effectiveness is a condition for worker enthusiasm. The third chapter deals with the concept of job satisfaction, or what people feel about the nature of work itself. Surveys surprisingly indicate that most people like their jobs, while only a minority is dissatisfied with their jobs. This is based on the fact that people will continue doing jobs that they do well, or, as the author explain, \\"few people volunteer to fail.\\" However, a large number of employees still end up in jobs they dislike. One reason for this is job choice, especially in initial choices. Another reason is that people get stuck in a job, often for financial reasons. The final chapter on theconcept of achievement focuses on the external sources of satisfaction, the sense of achievement and accomplishment that comes from the opinions of others. The data from the authors suggests that many managers have trouble giving good, constructive feedback. The authors believe that performance feedback is a vehicle for guidance, evaluation, recognition, reward, and direction. Each of these five aspects and outcomes of feedback are discussed in detail, including giving some good advice on giving guidance and dealing with unsatisfactory performance. <br /> <br />The fourth part of the book - Enthusiastic Workforces, Motivated by Camaraderie - which consists of only 1 chapter and discusses the third and final of the Three Factory Theory, the concept of camaraderie. \\"The quality of social relationships in the workplace - its `social capital' - ... are critical for effective performance and, therefore, for a sense of achievement in one's work.\\" There is a short look back to the human relations school, first introduced by Elton Mayo during the 1930s-1940s, followed by a discussion whether we are doing any better now. They turn to socializing at work. \\"Although employees derive pleasure from associating with others ... their greatest satisfaction comes from interacting as a team on the job in the service of common performance goals. That is a tremendous source of morale for employees.\\" And they eventually conclude that \\"cooperation - not job descriptions, not organization charts, not formal procedures - is the glue that binds the parts of the organization.\\" There is also good guidance on building partnerships between work units, which are typically not as good as partnerships within work units. <br /> <br />The fifth and final part of this book - Bringing It All Together - consists of 2 chapters. In the first chapter the authors aim to provide guidance on how to think of the components of an organization as a system, which is governed by an organization culture. The authors identify the 12 hallmarks of a successful partnership. In addition, they also describe the three major organization types - transactional, paternalistic, and adversarial. \\"The partnership concept is powerful. It can be applied to the relationships of an organization with all its key constituencies.\\" The title of the final chapter of this book is self-explanatory - Translating Partnership Theory into Partnership Practice. It aims for \\"a more comprehensive statement of a process for advancing an organization toward a partnership culture.\\" Before the authors outline a very useful 9-step action process, they accentuate \\"that action must begin with, and be sustained by, senior management.\\" Last, but not least, the authors introduce 9 questions that each addresses a recommended step for introducing partnership. <br /> <br />Yes, I do like this book. It introduces a Three Factor Theory of Human Motivation in the Workplace, which needs to be translated into The Partnership Organization. The theory is well translated into a practical process. In accordance with conclusions of recent research by others, the partnership organization is also built on three `softer factors'. I particularly like the last chapter, which really combines the book well and translates it into 9 useful steps which should be used as a checklist by managers. I believe that this book is a useful addition to other research into high-performance organizations, such as Tom Peters & Robert Waterman (In Search of Excellence, 1982), Jim Collins & Jerry Porras (Built to Last, 1994), Jim Collins (Good to Great, 2001). I must admit that the amount of research, data and surveys by the authors is mindblowing and is well covered in the appendices. Recommended to all people interested in management and successful organizations.	2005-07-11
US	49458047	RR8VJYN78824X	074326357X	209078505	A Land of Two Halves	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A witty report of a hitch-hiking tour around New Zealand	English-born Joe Bennett was a teacher when he went to New Zealand at the age of 29. He was supposed to stay for just a year, but sixteen years on he is still there. This book covers the author's hitch-hiking trip around New Zealand. \\"In the trip I am about to go on, I want to see the place as clearly as I can.\\" However, the main purpose for the trip is to find out whether Joe should stay or go when his dog dies in the next few years. Before I start this book review, I must make readers aware that this book is nothing like a traditional tour or travel guide. <br /> <br />Just like the title suggests, this book consists of two halves. The first half of the book covers his travels on the South Island of New Zealand, while the second half covers the North Island. \\"The North Island is different from the South Island. It has a different history, a different geography and a different climate.\\" These differences are very much covered as he describes his experiences while hitch-hiking around both the larger and smaller towns. Since he is somewhat of an outsider, he also covers the issue of the national identity - \\"The question of national identity is raised so often and so tediously that there are times when New Zealand's most prominent characteristic seems to be wondering whether it has any prominent characteristics.\\" As people who have been to New Zealand will know is that the country is beautiful and full of contradictions. The author believes that there are plenty of distinctions about New Zealanders: \\"What about the vaunted practicality, the no-nonsense earthiness, the number-eight-wire ingenuity, the rugged independence, the compulsion to travel, the willingness to work hard?\\" Joe Bennett covers all these subjects fantastically and full of wit. Some of the language used might upset some readers, it covers the issues realistically. After weeks of travelling from Invergarcill and Bluff at the south point of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the north point of the NorthIsland he also manages to find the answer to the main purpose of the book: \\"It will be good to have a young dog around again. And it may perk up my old dog in her years of decline.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, I do like this book. The author discusses the hidden realities behind New Zealand. It discusses the most important details of the larger towns on the South and North Island of the beautiful New Zealand. I believe that this book does two things. First, it provides tourists with a good introduction into the 'real' New Zealand, which is not covered within the traditional travel guide. Second, it is an enjoyable read. I have just one issue with the book. I believe that the author has 'cheated' in the second half of the book when he decides to stop hitch-hiking and decides to hire a car. He also becomes somewhat less detailed in the last quarter of the book (homesick to his dog??). I still recommend this book to all (potential) visitors to New Zealand.	2005-07-10
US	49458047	R39L6HJC51QJ0H	0471652857	713438275	McKinsey's Marvin Bower: Vision, Leadership, and the Creation of Management Consulting	Books	3	8	12	N	N	Marvin Bower: The creator/inventor of management consulting	Elizabeth Haas Edersheim holds a PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and worked at McKinsey & Company from 1979 to 1988. She is now strategic advisor to a number of Fortune 500 companies. The late Marvin Bower is seen as the creator/inventor of management consulting. I see this book, which was published in 2004, as a semi-autobiography. It is split up in two parts, whereby the first part - Translating a Vision into Reality - discusses the creation and development of McKinsey & Company and the second part - A Leader's Leader - discusses the impact of Bower on others.    The first chapter - Marvin Bower - discusses is a short summary on the working life of Marvin Bower, who was born in Cleveland in 1903 and died at the age of in January 2003. During his lifetime worked for a total of 59 years at McKinsey & Company, which he almost personally transformed from \\"a nearly defunct accounting and engineering firm into a preeminent adviser to senior executives throughout business and, on occasion, government\\". His most remarkable distinction was his dedication to value and his personal integrity, which is a common theme throughout the book. Bower was the first person to graduate from Harvard Law School (1928) and later Harvard Business School (1930). The short second chapter - The Vision - discusses Bower's vision of and passion for management consulting which began during his career as a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue between 1930 and 1933. His vision and values led the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Co., which was formed by James O. McKinsey, from a staff of 18 in 1933 to 2,500 by the time of his retirement in 1992. The third chapter - The Profession and the Institution - discusses the profession of management consulting and the institution (McKinsey & Co.). Bower conceived his vision of the institution as one firm with: a national presence; a strong firm personality; high-caliber, talented, and committed people; aversion to complacency; and regenerating leadership. Each is discussed in detail. \\"And - except for its personnel - a good reputation is a professional firm's most valuable earning asset.\\" The fourth and final chapter of the first part - Defining Moments of Leadership and Influence - discusses the nine points of key decision making spanning a 60-year period. Each of these nine points is discussed in detail, they range from the decision to go for a one-firm identity nationally in 1939 through to the objection to a joint venture with venture capital firm DLJ on 1969.    Chapter 5 - The Bower Reach - starts the weaker second part of the book. This chapter discusses the power and reach of Marvin Bower's leadership, which is truly astounding. During Bower's 17 years as managing director of McKinsey, more than 50 of the consultants evolved into CEOs of leading global companies. The author identifies 6 attributes responsible for his rich legacy of leadership. One of the most useful parts of this chapter is Bower's 1950-memorandum titled \\"Steps in Making and Executing Decisions\\", which essentially discusses McKinsey's famous problem-solving model (for more, read Ethan Rasiel's The McKinsey Mind). Chapter 6 - Inspiring Organizational Courage - discusses the fact that Bower was not reckless, but fearless. \\"Not all clients were willing or able to muster the courage required to make bold moves; others were put off by Marvin's bluntness.\\" This courage is discussed through case examples at Royal Dutch Shell (1956), Price Waterhouse (1979), and Harvard (1979). Chapter 7 - Educating a Generation of Leaders - discusses some examples from the list of graduates from the \\"Marvin School\\". It discusses in detail the careers of Harvey Golub (ex-Chairman of American Express), Gary MacDougal (leader of the Illinois welfare system reform), David Ogilvy (founder and ex-Chairman of Ogilvy & Mather), and Don Gogal (president and CEO of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc.). There are some short, but impressive, CVs from otherMcKinsey alumni. The book is concluded with a note by the author, timelines for Marvin Bower, McKinsey & Co. and Harvard Business School, a brief biography of Marvin Bower, and Marvin Bower's speech at the Partners' Conference of 1964.    I must admit that I am somewhat disappointed by this book. It starts of strong in the first part, but loses strength very much in the second part. Even so, we must acknowledge that Marvin Bower's work has left an enormous impact on business and the world. He was the visionary who created and developed management consulting through McKinsey & Company. I believe that the strongest part of his leadership was his principles and values, which are discussed in great detail in the first part of the book. I must admit that I expected more detail on McKinsey & Company itself, such as the problem-solving techniques, internal training, and recruitment of the strongest talent in the world. One other comment I have is that I am now quite interested in Marvin Bower's personal memoirs to which the author makes lots of references. I have been quite hard and given this book 3 stars (4 stars for the first part and 3 for the second part) just to indicate my disappointment. I recommend readers to read the first part of the book, the author's note and appendices.	2005-06-24
US	49458047	R3N5OZ7AIRYPNM	0201067447	62500400	002: Process Consultation, Vol. 2: Lessons for Managers and Consultants (Addison-Wesley on Organizational Development Series)	Books	5	11	13	N	N	The use of process consultation to improve organizations	Edgar H. Schein is Professor of Management Emeritus in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a real academic heavyweight having written numerous books, articles and papers. In 1969 he published 'Process Consultation: Its Role in Organizational Development', of which he states that he \\"was writing more in anger than with perspective\\". In this follow-up book he tried to explain and clarify the concept of consultation and helping  which was outlined in the first volume. \\"The goals of this new book, then, are (1) to reaffirm the concept of process consultation as a viable model of how to work with human systems, (2) to clarify the concept were needed, and (3) to introduce some modifications and new ideas that elaborate on the original ideas.\\" <br /> <br />The book is split up in 3 parts. In Part I - Introduction and Overview, which consists of three chapters, Schein introduces the common grounds of managers and consultants (which is the helping orientation), process consultation, and \\"the process\\" itself. He introduces a definition of process consultation which \\"is a set of activities on the part of the consultant that help the client to perceive, understand, and act upon the process events that occur in the client's environment.\\" Whereby he emphasizes that the concept of process central is to understanding consultation and management. \\"Process refers to how things are done rather than what is done.\\" He continues, \\"Process is everywhere. In order to help, intervene, and facilitate human problem solving, one must focus on communication and interpersonal processes.\\" <br /> <br />In Part II - Simplifying Models of Human Processes, which also consists of three chapters, Schein examines several models of consultation and argues that the process-consultation model works for consultants as interveners and is potentially most useful for managers. \\"The most important thing for managers or consultants to understand is what goes on inside their own heads.\\" He introduces the basic ORJI cycle, which is based on the fact that our nervous system observes (O), reacts (R), analyzes, processes, and make judgments (J), and intervenes in order to make something happen (I). He later updates this cycle into a more realistic depiction of the ORJI cycle, through the introduction of 4 traps. Schein than states that the cultural rules of interaction is possibly the most powerful determinant whether a viable helping relationship will be established. In the final chapter of this part, he examines in detail a simplified model of the change process: (1) Unfreezing; (2) changing; and (3) refreezing. <br /> <br />In the final part of the book - The Consulting Process in Action, which is also the longest part of the book with five chapters, the author examines in detail the strategy and tactics of intervention. \\"The most important point to be made about clients is that the consultant must always be clear who the client is at any given moment in time, and must distinguish clearly among contact, intermediate, primary, and ultimate client.\\" Schein discusses what the consultant or manager can actually say or do to accomplish some of the goals of process consultation. \\"The strategy and tactics of intervention have to be guided by the ultimate assumptions underlying the helping process.\\" In addition, he provides categories of types of interventions and discusses the possible dilemmas that can arise in the consultation processes. \\"The skill of intervening is to be so tuned in to what is going on that one's sense of timing and appropriateness is based on the external events, not one's internal assumptions or theories.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, this is a good book on process consultation. I was somewhat concerned when I started reading this book, due to Schein's highly academical background. However, the book has been a revelation. It is highly practical and has good tips on which can be put in practical use. I believe that it usefulfor both consultants and managers, as the author set out from the start. I believe that the three parts can be read in any order, whereby the last part is possibly the most useful as it is the most practical. Please note that the writing style is now somewhat outdated and academical. Highly recommended to consultants and managers alike.	2005-05-17
US	49458047	R3C0Q64GQASFV7	0609610570	431185442	Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Execution advice for leaders and senior executives	Larry Bossidy is Chairman and former CEO of Honeywell International. Ram Charan has taught at both the Harvard Business School and the Kellogg School of Northwestern University. This book is split up in three sections (consisting of two to four chapters each), plus an useful introduction and conclusion. <br /> <br />In Part I - Why Execution Is Needed, the authors explain the discipline of execution. \\"Execution is a specific set of behaviors and techniques that companies need to master in order to have competitive advantage. It is a discipline of its own.\\" This discipline is based on a set of building blocks that every leader must use to design, install, and operate the three core processes of execution. <br /> <br />These building blocks are described in Part II - The Building Blocks of Execution. I believe that Chapter 3, which describes the leader's seven essential behaviors, is the best of the book. This chapter is followed by Building Block Two - Creating the Framework for Cultural Change. \\"To change a business's culture, you need a set of processes - social operating mechanisms - that will change the beliefs and behaviors of people ...\\" The final chapter in this part discusses human resources management, or having the right people in the right place. A large part of this chapter is based on Bossidy's experience within General Electric (under the leadership of the legendary Jack Welch). <br /> <br />In Part III - The Three Core Processes of Execution, the authors introduce the three core processes required to fulfill the building blocks of Part II. The three processes are the people process, strategy process, and operations process, which are each explained in an individual chapter. \\"Leaders need to master the individual processes and the way they work together as a whole. They are the foundation for the discipline of execution, at the center of conceiving and executing a strategy.\\" <br /> <br />I have re-read this book once I completed Jack Welch's autobiography. Following the first read I was somewhat disappointed as I thought that the title was wrong and was only useful for senior executives and above. I have had to change my mind, the processes introduced should be used at all levels within organizations and not just at top levels. I still believe that the book is somewhat repetitive and although there are some good chapters, it is not worth the 270 pages. This book is useful for people who want to improve their implementation skills and get things done around their organizations.	2005-05-03
US	49458047	RLG87HHUO4NMO	0446690686	344910126	Jack: Straight from the Gut	Books	4	3	5	N	N	One of the great business leaders of the 20th Century	Jack Welch was General Electric Chairman & CEO from 1981 to 2001 and is seen as one of the greatest business leaders of the 20st Century. The book is split up in five sections, an epilogue and the issue I read included a revised afterword.    Section I - Early Years deals with Welch's youth, his education (PhD), his start at General Electric (GE) Plastics as engineer in October 1960, and his promotions within from engineer to general manager of GE Plastics in June 1968 ($26m in annual sales), VP of GE's chemical and metallurgical division in July 1971 ($400m), GE group executive in June 1973 ($2bn), and GE senior executive for the consumer products businesses in December 1977 ($4.2bn). The final chapter of this section discusses the race between 5 senior executives for the succession to Reg Jones (GE Chairman & CEO). And in December 1980 Welch got the nod from Reg Jones and on April 1, 1981, he officially took over. Although Welch's performance was good, it was still a surprise for many, including Welch himself: \\"Obviously, I wasn't a natural fit for the corporation. I had little respect or tolerance for protocol. I was an impatient manager, especially with people who didn't perform.\\" General Electric at that time had annual sales of $25 billion, with profits of $1.5bn, and 404,000 employees.    Section II - Building a Philosophy discusses Welch's early, turbulent years as CEO. \\"I came to the job without many of the external CEO skills. ... But I did know what I wanted the company to `feel' like\\" He discusses the No.1 or No.2 vision (\\"fix, close, or sell\\"), the three circles (services, core, and high technology), the outright sales of businesses (the air-conditioning business, Utah International, and the appliance business, whereby the last sale did not go down well with GE employees), and the cutbacks in many parts of GE (headcount went down 118,000 between 1980 and 1985; 81,000 lost their jobs and 57,000 in sold businesses). Due to all this actions Welch was nicknamed \\"Neutron Jack\\" in mid-1982 by Newsweek: \\"The guy who removed the people but left the buildings standing.\\" (\\"I hated it, and it hurt\\") Late 1985, GE made the strategic acquisition of RCA for $6.3bn cash, who was then the biggest non-oil deal in history. In this section he also discusses the strange, but successful, combination between Bob Wright (\\"a light bulb maker\\") and NBC, which led to success in cable TV, CNBC, MSNBC, and NBC itself. One black mark on Welch's reign has been the saga regarding the PCB contamination of the Hudson River, which has been going on for 25 years. That particular experience has changed Welch's perception of government and he makes clear that he (still) does not agree with the government's stance towards GE on this case.    Section IV - Game Changers discusses the four major initiatives GE pursued in the 1990s: 1. Globalization: Global sales went from $9bn in 1987 (19% of GE's overall sales) to $53bn (40%) in 2001, which Welch believes mainly grew out of Paolo Fresco's passion and appointment as senior VP in 1987. 2. Services: The successful service experiences from the medical business and the revised strategy of the nuclear business were shared and implemented into the other GE businesses. This has resulted in the growth from $8bn in 1995 to $19bn in 2001 and a possible $80bn by 201o. 3. Six Sigma: Through Welch's friend and ex-GE Vice Chairman Larry Bossidy (than CEO of AlliedSignal) Six Sigma was introduced in 1995. Six Sigma means less than 3.4 percent defects per million operations. \\"That's 99.99966 percent of perfection.\\" 4. E-business: \\"The internet revolution nearly passed me by - until [second wife] Jane made me comfortable with it\\" (in 1999). Welch admits that he never fell for the old vs. new economy during the dot-com era. \\"... the only extra expense is for Internet development. The big company already has strong brands and the systems to fulfil orders.\\" In 2000 GE had $7bn on-line sales and $14-15bn in 2001. \\"E-businessand GE's installed base are made for each other.\\"    In Section V Jack Welch looks back and forward. The first chapter discusses the insulting treatment of GE by the European Commission regarding the $44bn acquisition of Honeywell International in 2001, where he gets told to \\"Go home, Mr. Welch.\\" The next chapter he discusses what it means to be a CEO: \\"Being CEO is the nuts!\\" In that chapter he discusses shortly about 30 ideas that worked for him. \\"There's no pat formula to this CEO things. ... Pick and choose among them, or just toss them all.\\" There is also a short chapter on the game of golf, which is one of Welch's largest passions - and he is good at it with a handicap of about 3. There is quite a long chapter on the GE succession in 2001, which was eventually between 3 executives, and the planning that went into that succession. There is also a short epilogue and a slightly longer afterword (with comments on his post-retirement package from GE).    Yes, this is unmistakably Jack Welch's autobiography. It is blunt, fast and straight to the point. Although the book is about 450 pages long, it reads as a much shorter book and he could probably have filled another 450 pages. Jack Welch is considered as one of the great business leaders of the 20th century, together with the likes of Alfred P. Sloan. But the autobiographies of Sloan (\\"My Years with General Motors\\") and Welch hardly have any comparisons. Sloan's autobiography is much more detailed, while Welch's is more \\"helicopter view\\". I do have a few comments about this autobiography, there is not enough on the \\"real work\\" that took place, not enough on the \\"execution tools\\", and not enough on the financial numbers during his time at GE (within an appendix in future editions perhaps?). I recommend Larry Bossidy's book \\"Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done\\" to people interested in the \\"real work\\" and execution tools used at GE during this period. Still, a good entertaining business autobiography.	2005-04-14
US	49458047	R2WW5LKMP6OEP5	1595753575	47046333	The Baron Son: Vade Mecum 7	Books	4	13	14	N	N	A guidebook to get you thinking	Vicky Theresa Davis, William R. Patterson, and D. Marques Patton are entrepreneurs, sales and strategic business consultants. This book was published in 2005. <br /> <br />I did not find it easy to write a review of The Baron Son. It is not just an unconventional business/management book, it is also an unconvential story. The subtitle of the book is Vadecum 7, which stands for \\"a guidebook kept constantly at hand\\". The story is set in the desert region of Mh'ki and the main person is the son of Baron Qahhar. Through the use of autobiographical storytelling by the main person the authors discuss 11 Supreme Principles which provides a way to better onself. Each supreme principle is discussed in a separate chapter and tells a separate story in the life of the Baron Son. Neither the story nor the supreme principles are written in 'real' English, it is more something like 'old-fashioned' English. Each of the supreme principles discuss management/business issues which you can come across every day. <br /> <br />This is a highly unusual book and unlike anything I have read before. The supreme principles remind me of the habits from Stephen Covey's 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People'. They are non-descriptive, but make you think. And this is where I believe the Baron Son gets its attractiveness from, it gives you ideas and makes you think about all sorts of issues. Just like some other reviewers I did not enjoy the strange writing style either, it makes reading hard work. Like I said earlier, this book is difficult to review which means that you just have to read it yourself.	2005-03-31

He has written numerous management books and articles. This book was originally published in 1985 and is split up in four parts. <br /> <br />The first part - The Changing Nature of Managerial and Professional Work - discusses the fact that most managerial, technical, and professional jobs have become significantly more complex due to a number of very fundamental economic and social trends over several decades. In order to emphasize the impact o the complex social milieu, Kotter uses a perspective which empoys two basis concepts: (1) Diversity, which \\"refers to the differences among people with respect to goals, values, stakes, assumptions, and perceptions.\\" (2) Interdependence which \\"refers to a state in which two or more parties have power over each other because they are, to some degree, dependent on each other.\\" Excellent companies are successful in managing these two concepts, which, according to Kotter, needs strong leadership throughout organizations. He continues to discuss the requirements at personal, organizational, and societal level. <br /> <br />Parts two and three are closely related and detail the leadership challenge for high-level executive positions and lower-level professional and technical jobs. Part II - The Relational Context of Work describes the day-to-day issues associated with the three basic kinds of organizational relationships: (1) Relations outside the chain of command, (2) relations with subordinates, and (3) relations with superiors.  <br />The third part - The Life Cycle of Leadership - describes the leadership challenge at the various stages in a career inside a typical complex organization. <br /> <br />The final part of the book - Implications - summarizes recommendations on improving one's personal effectiveness at work. It also discusses the requirements to increase the supply of people who are capable of handling difficult leadership jobs. In addition, there is an acknowledgement which describes the roots of this book - it is based on seven different projects conducted during the 1970s and 1980s at Harvard Business School. <br /> <br />Yes, this is certainly a good book on this subject. It is based on strong academic research from one of the best business schools in the world. Main criticism that I have is that the books feels somewhat outdates since it was published in 1985. However, I feel that a little revision from the author would do wonders. There are some great checklists in this book, which are very realistic and can be used in real life. It is written in a very well organized manner and can be used as a handbook. I especially recommended it to all people new to management.	2005-03-10
US	49458047	R39FT6960L5YDM	0297843710	690696114	Himalaya	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Traveller's account on 3,000 miles across Himalaya	Michael Palin became well-known through his work with Monty Python. He has also written various travel books, based on his previous travels which have been shown on British TV.    In the Introduction Palin describes how the idea for an expedition across the Himalaya was sprung while looking for a new adventure after his previous trip through Sahara. This book is a \\"traveller's account\\" and not a \\"mountaineer's account\\" of Palin & Co.'s journey through six countries and 3,000 miles of Himalaya. The journey took about 18 months of planning and about 6 months of filming/travel. \\"Apart from missing out some rest days and days at airports, I've presented the journey as a continuous narrative because that, in effect, is exactly what it was.\\"    Of course certain problems were known from the outset on this highly sensitive part of the world: The British Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to most areas; the whole Khasmir region was/is highly volatile; the Maoists in Nepal are engaged in a guerrille war with the government; the Chinese government is highly sensitive about film crews in Tibet; the Indian government has concerns about safety in Assam. On top of this, there is (still) the East/West-tension following 9/11 and the deadly SARS epidemic in China.    Palin breaks down the journey on a country-by-country basis, starting at the Khyber Pass on the Afghanistan/Pakistan-border on the western side of Himalaya, passing through Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet, China, Bhutan and eventually finishing at the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh on the east side of Himalaya. Palin uses a witty, entertaining writing style to detail the adventures, findings, and observations in and of each country. He is rarely opinionated, although he sometimes places questions about lifestyles, etc. I don't want to discuss too much details in this review, but the variety of landscapes, climates, lifestyles, religions within this 3000 miles distance is astonishing. The text is accompanied by lots of beautiful photographs taken by Basil Pao.    Yes, I do like this book which accompanies the BBC-series with the same name. The book is easily readabble with lots of fantastic pictures describing this enormous journey across this bizarre area of our planet. Whether you like the TV-series or book better is a personal choice, I have also seen the series and like both. I would like to conclude the review with some words from the book: \\"... Himalaya was a wonderfully, magically, brilliant journey, with more gasps of astonishment per square mile than any other in my entire life. And for once, I think I might be right.\\"	2005-01-28

Previously he was Professor of Public Policy at French business school INSEAD. Christopher A. Bartlett is Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. They are both prominent authors of numerous management books and articles. This book won the 1997 Igor Ansoff Award. The book is split up in four parts, each consisting of 2-to-4 chapters.<br />Part I - Birth of a New Corporate Model serves as an introduction, describing &quot;the most profound change in management in a lifetime&quot;: the move from organization man to individualized corporation. &quot;In this book, we will describe this management model and illustrate how some of the pioneers of this new approach have implemented it in their own companies.&quot; The first chapter, The Rediscovery of Management, frames the historical context and describes the authors' research motivation. The second chapter, Rebirth of an Organization Man, provides an example of how the transformational changes at one company affected the activities, motivation, and performance of a &quot;classic organization man.&quot; In Part II - From Organization Man to Individualized Corporation, the authors describe the organizational characteristics required to develop the three core capabilities that distinguish the 'individualized corporation'. The first core capability is its ability to inspire individual creativity and initiative in all its people, built on a fundamental faith in individuals. The second core characteristic is the ability to link and leverage pockets of entrepreneurial activity and individual expertise by building an integrated process of organizational learning. The third core feature is its ability to continuously renew itself. Each core capability is discussed in detail. The third part of the book - Building and Managing the Individualized Corporation - explores the managerial implications fo above mentioned characteristics and on how companies can go about building and managing the individualized corporation. The authors use the final chapter of this part to discuss the transformation process that has taken at various companies, such as Philips Electronics, ABB, ISS, 3M, McKinsey &amp; Co., and General Electric. In the fourth and final part - Toward A New Corporate Era - the authors examine the new managerial philosophy behind this new corporate model. By using the case of Swedish company IKEA, they explain the redefinition of &quot;the role of corporate management away from its classic focus on strategy, structure, and systems to one built around purpose, process, and people&quot;. This redefinition is really the main message of the book.<br />I have a mixed feeling about this book. Yes, I believe that the authors are right in the sense that we have now entered the era of individualized corporations. But my main feeling is that I either read this book too late or that it was published too late. Some other great management thinkers, such as Peter F. Drucker, Charles Handy and Henri Mintzberg, have covered this subject/trend several decades before. Also, the book does not provide us with enough tips and checklist to enable us to manage these (new) types of organization. The book is also rather long and I recommend other readers to go for the three authors' Harvard Business Review-articles covering this book, starting with &quot;Changing the Role of Top Management: Beyond Strategy to Purpose&quot; (1994).mentioned characteristics and on how companies can go about building and managing the individualized corporation.

Thornton is a HR/management development consultant with 'Be The Leader Associates (his own company). He is the author of 'Be the Leader, Make the Difference' (2000). He as BA in Psychology and Political Science at Ohio University. He has a MBA from American International College.<br />This book has a very particular set-up. It is split up into 24 chapters, whereby each chapter discusses a management/leadership skill/subject. The author uses a \\"triangle concept\\" to identify and simplify three critical variables that compromise each skill/subject. These three variables are then discussed,although relatively shortly. At the end of each chapter there are some examples from managers and leaders who have applied the concept, plus some comments from their employees'. There are a wide range of subjects/skills covered, ranging from finance to career management.<br />This is a funny little book. It discusses 24 management/leadership subjects in just 172 pages. And this is what I find the problem with this book, it tries to cover too many subjects in such a short space. Yes, it provides us with great reminders on these subjects, but readers are probably best of to have some preliminary management knowledge before reading this book. The author is definitely knowledgeable and should either write a \\"handbook\\" of management/leadership or write a bestseller on one/some of the subjects covered in this book.	2004-04-07

Stephen J. Hoch is Professor of Marketing, while Howard C. Kunreuther is Professor of Decision Sciences and Public Policy and Management. Robert E. Gunther serves as coordinating writer. The book is split up in 4 parts, with each part consisting 3-to-5 standalone chapters.<br />Chapter 1 - A Complex Web of Decisions serves as an introduction to the book, explaining that we make a wide range of decisions every day. It starts with a very strong point: &quot;Most of us do not make great decisions, and few of us are aware of this fact.&quot; However, through the different chapters in this book the editors hope to improve our awareness of the intricacies of the decision-making process. &quot;We examine how people should make decisions according to the models, how they actually behave, and how they can improve their decision making.&quot;<br />The set-up of the book is that we look at decision making from various levels, from an individual/detailed level to a very broad level. In Part I - Personal Decision Making, consisting of 3 chapters, the authors look at individual decision making. These decisions are often influenced by emotions, intuitions, and a focus on present versus future consequences. &quot;How do these factors influence decision making? How can we use these personal assets and foibles to make better decisions?&quot; Understanding these factors should allow us to improve our personal decision making.<br />The second part, Managerial Decision Making, consisting of 4 chapters, focuses on the managerial decision-making process. &quot;We may be more concerned in this role with using models to set up decision processes in our organization, balancing speed and reflection, dealing with complexity and reframing questions to break out of traditional mind-sets.&quot; This part provides us with a variety of tools and perspectives that can help our decision making with an interesting chapter on the differences in Eastern and Western decision making, but also a very strong one on framing of decisions.<br />Part III - Multiparty Decision Making moves from a single manager to the next level of complexity - interactions among several managers in negotiations across multiple periods. It discusses critical issues at this level. This part, in particular, shines new light on a number of decision making issues. It provides a link with game theory (the field of strategy making), reputation, negotiations, and the impact of modern communications technologies on negotiations.<br />The final and broadest perspective is discussed in Part IV - Impact of Decision Making on Society. Decisions on this level involve a mix of personal and collective values and reflect quirks in how we prepare for high-impact, low-risk events. And there are some amazing conclusions in this part, whereby we sometimes follow the crowd in the wrong direction and the different approaches between our public and private decisions.<br />Although this book is named 'Wharton on Making Decisions', there are various chapters by specialists from other academic institutions. Each chapter is an excellent piece of work and can be read on a stand-alone basis. However, as a collection it enables us to improve our understanding of the decision making process on different levels, which should enable us to make better decisions, which, in turn, should result in outstanding outcomes. The insights are based on the latest research in this field (this book was initially published in 2001). Please note that the book is written in somewhat academical language.	2004-04-04

Previously he has been at the University of Illinois, the University of California at Berkeley, and as a Visiting Professor at the Harvard Business School. He has written several business- and management-related books.<br />This book consists of four parts, with each part consisting of 3-to-6 chapters. Pfeffer starts with a definition of power: &quot;... the potential ability to influence behavior, to change the course of events, to overcome resistance, and to get people to do things that they would not otherwise do.&quot; This power is utilized and realized through politics and influence. Based on above definition the book discusses the details to the implementation process which consists of seven steps:<BR>1. Decide on your goals.<BR>2. Diagnose who is important in getting your goals accomplished.<BR>3. Have a sense of the game being played, the players, and what their positions are.<BR>4. Ascertain the power based of the other players, as well as your own potential and actual sources of power.<BR>5. Determine your relative strength, along with the strength of other players.<BR>6. Diagnose what is going to happen in an organization, as well as preparing yourself to take action.<BR>7. Consider the various strategies or tactics that are available to you, as well as those used by others.<br />I believe it is important to keep these steps in mind since the book does not follow the sequence of these steps. The other chapters in Part I - Power in Organizations provide help both in diagnosing the extent to which situations are going to involve the use of power and in figuring out who the political actors are and what their points are likely to be. Some important quotes in this part are: &quot;Power is a valuable resource [and] those who have power typically conserve it for important issues [scarcity and importance are correlated].&quot; &quot;Knowing the power of various organizational members and subunits is important, and so is understanding whose help you need in order to achieve your goals.&quot;<br />Part II - Sources of Power, consisting of 6 chapters, considers where power comes from, or some people and some subunits have more power than others. It offers implicit lessons on how to acquire more power and influence for ourselves. &quot;Power comes from being in the 'right' place. A good place or position is one that provides you with: 1. control over resources.; 2. control over or extensive access to information; and 3. formal authority.&quot; By using both well-known and practical examples, the author discusses each of these aspects in detail. His view is that although individual attributes are important, being in the right place (in particular, the right subunit) is more important.<br />Once we know where power comes, we need to know how to use it effectively to get things done. This is the subject of Part III - Strategies and Tactics for Employing Power Effectively, which consists of 6 chapters. It begins with the topic of framing and how the way we see things depends upon the context in which they are seen. This, in turn, is affected by the principles of contrast, commitment, and scarcity. There is also the consideration of interpersonal influence by examining the impact of what others are saying or doing, the effects of liking, and the use of emotional contrast. Understanding this make it possible for us to consider some strategic elements in the exercise and development of power. &quot;It is not enough to know that power exists. It is also critical to know how power is used - to have an arsenal of strategies and tactics that translate power and influence into practical results.&quot;<br />However, the discussions of the strategies and tactics for employing power might us lose sight of what organizations are all about - getting things done. Therefore the final section of the book, Part IV - PowerDynamics, begins by providing some cautionary ideas about how power is lost. It shows how even the mighty fall, and consider what this means for us as we think about own personal relationship to power and influence. This part also considers how power dynamics can be productive or unproductive for the organization. &quot;The book is about managing with power, and it is also about managing power.&quot; The final chapter returns to the main subject of the book: getting things done through understanding and using power and influence. &quot;... there is a greater sin than making mistakes or influencing others - the sin of doing nothing.&quot;<br />Yes, I do like this book. It discusses a subject with which most of us have to deal day-in day out, whether we like it or not. Jeffrey Pfeffer provides us with an excellent handbook for understanding power and influence, but also with strategies and tactics on using it. Pfeffer also recognizes that certain individuals are obsessed with politics and power (I think that most of you will know what I am talking about), and therefore finishes the book with some excellent cautionary advice. Although the author has a strong academical background the book is written in a very practical manner complemented with good, understandable examples. Highly recommended.	2004-04-03

Drucker is probably the greatest management thinker of the 20st Century. He has been Professor at New York University and at 83 years old still teaches at the Graduate Management School of Claremont University, California. This book, originally published in 1966, is split up in seven chapters, plus a conclusion.<br />Effectiveness is not just about intelligence, imagination and knowledge, it is about getting results. And the author believes that \\"effectiveness can be learned - and it also has to be learned.\\" In Chapter 1 - Effectiveness Can Be Learned, Drucker discusses the five habits of the mind that have to be acquired to be an effective executive: 1. Know thy time; 2. Outward contribution, or what can I contribute?; 3. Making strength productive; 4. First things first; and 5. Effective decision-making. Each of these elements of executive effectiveness are covered in Chapters 2-to-5.<br />Chapter 6 - The Elements of Decision-Making, which is quite a long chapter is the start of the second part of the book. \\"Effective executives do not make a great many decisions. They concentrate on the important ones. They try to think through what is strategic and generic, rather than 'solve problems'. So what are the elements of the decision process? 1. \\"Is this a generic situation or an exception?\\" Most problems are really generic.; 2. What the decision to accomplish?; 3. What is right, rather than what is acceptable?; 4. Converting the decision into action.; and 5. Feedback has to be built into the decision. This sounds simple, but is rather difficult in practice. But what about the decision itself? \\"A decision is a judgment. It is a choice between alternatives.\\" And this is the subject of Chapter 7 - Effective Decisions. Contrary to common knowledge one does not start with facts, but one starts with opinions. And the right decision ultimately grows out of the clash and conflict of divergent opinions and out of consideration of competing alternatives. Finally, Drucker concludes with the conclusion that effectiveness MUST be learned. He bases his assumption on the fact that the executive's job is to be effective and that effectiveness can be learned and that effectiveness will/has become more important for the knowledge worker.<br />As usual, another great book by Peter Drucker. Although the book was originally published in 1966, it still strikes home the simple basic of effectiveness. This book is not only for business executives, but for all people wanting to become effective and in any field required. The author makes use of great examples from the greatest thinkers in time. I recommend this book to readers who did like Larry Bossidy's 'Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done' and Stephen Covey's 'Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'. Just one comment: Although Drucker makes it sound easy, it requires a lot of hard work and discipline. The author uses simple business US-English.	2004-02-12

Simon was Chaired Professor in Psychology and Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon University. He was awarded the Noble Prize in Economics in 1978, for his work on rational decision-making in business organizations. This book was originally published in 1947; this fourth edition was published in 1997. This book is a result from Simon's research into decision-making processes within administrative organizations (with a larger emphasis on public organizations).<br />The aims of the book are to describe decision-making processes within human organizations and to examine how modern technology are changing management and decision-making. The book is split up in five parts. The first part, Chapters 2 and 3, lay out conceptual issues to the structure of human choice. The second part, chapter 4 and 4, describe and explain the realities of human decision-making and the influences on the decision-making environment. The third part, chapter 6, discusses the motivational link between the individual and the organization, with a particular emphasis on the influence of authority. The fourth part, chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10, looks in detail at the main organizational influence processes and how these affect the decision-making process. The final part, chapter 11, links analysis to organization structure. Each chapter is very detailed and there is an commentary to each chapter discussing old and new themes impacting on each subject within that chapter.<br />Yes, yes, yes, this is probably the best book ever written on decision-making and decision-making processes. Perhaps it is not simple and easy to read, since it is very detailed and specific. The extensive commentaries with each chapter is extremely useful and brings this book up-to-date. Highly recommended to all people interested in management and decision-making. The author does not use very simple business-language and there is plenty of psychology terminology, making it not a very quick read. A fantastic masterpiece from a true genius!	2003-09-23

Sloan Jr. was CEO of General Motors from 1923 to 1946. This book was originally published in 1964. Sloan is seen as the first person to have worked out systematic organization in a big company, planning and strategy, measurements, the principle of decentralization - in short, basic concepts of a discipline of management. This is a difficult book to review, since it is more a historic piece on GM's history and development from Sloan's perspective than an autobiography. It does not discuss the individual Alfred P. Sloan Jr., it discusses Alfred P. Sloan Jr. as professional manager. The chapters also come across as business school lessons in different subjects, ranging from general management through to accounting, marketing and compensation strategies.<br />The book consists of two parts. &quot;Part One is an integrated continuous story of the main lines of General Motors' progress, involving the origin and development of the corporation's basic management concepts in the areas of organization, finance and product.&quot; It discusses the extreme growth and development of the automobile industry from the early 1900s through to the early 1960s. It also discusses the methods General Motors introduced used to manage the corporation (Sloan all through the book keeps emphasizing the concept of the corporation). He later became known as a committee-man, because he used different types of committees to get/keep various divisions talking and working with each other.<br />&quot;Part Two consists of individually distinct sections dealing in some detail with engineering, distribution, overseas operations, war and defense products, incentive compensation, and other aspects and branches of the enterprise.&quot; This part of the book discusses in greater detail the different experiences and events during Sloan's reign as CEO. It discusses some very interesting subjects, such as the evolution of the automobile, relationships with dealers, World War I and II efforts, and personnel and labor relations. Chapter 23 and 24 are really the conclusion to this book.<br />Yes, this is a great book. It is a TRUE business classic. It discusses all the subjects involved in business from a CEO's point of view. I was amazed to see the amount of detail Sloan has gone through while writing this book, there are plenty of quotes from annual reports, memoranda, conversations, etc. However, some readers will be disappointed by the lack of insight into Sloan's personal life. This particular edition includes an introduction by Peter F. Drucker, who explains why this book is MUST reading for all MBA and business students, but also all people that want to be serious about management. Highly recommended. The book is written in simple business US-English.	2003-08-23

Drucker is probably the greatest management thinker of the 20st Century. He has been Professor at New York University and at 83 years old still teaches at the Graduate Management School of Claremont University, California. This book is split up in three parts, each consisting of three-to-eight chapters. In the Introduction, Drucker clearly explains the thinking behind this &quot;what to do&quot; book: &quot;It tries to develop a point of view, concepts and approaches for finding what should be done and how to go about doing it.&quot;<br />Part I - Understanding the Business - consists of eight chapters and stresses analysis and understanding. It deals with what Drucker terms &quot;business realities&quot;, or the situation most likely to be found in any business at any given time. It discusses the relationship between results, resources, efforts, opportunities and expectations. It further discusses cost centers and cost structure, but also methods for understanding the business from the &quot;outside&quot;. Chapter 8 - This Is Our Business - can be seen as a summary for this first and longest part of the book.<br />Part II - Focus on Opportunity - focuses on opportunities and leads to decisions. It discusses the opportunities and needs in each of the major economic dimensions of a business: making the present business effective, finding and realizing business potential, and making the future of the business today. In particular, this last issue has become a Peter F. Drucker-trademark.<br />The final part of the book, Part III - A Program for Performance, discusses how to translate insights and decisions into purposeful performance. This sounds simple but it is not. Through fairly short chapter, Drucker explains that key decisions have to be made regarding the idea and objectives of the business, choice of excellences, and points of focus. It also requires a number of strategic choices. Last, but not least, Drucker also discusses the managerial structure required for reaching the right performance. The Conclusion rephrases the thesis on the individual executive and his commitment, in particular on the commitment of top management.<br />This book was originally published in 1964, but it is still very readable. Yes, perhaps some of the examples are outdated but nevertheless. It draws on Drucker's experience as a consultant with all types of businesses and industries, and this shows itself into the hundreds-and-hundreds of examples throughout the book. And although Drucker makes management sound very simple, he knows that it is not. However, the tools and techniques that he offers in this book are very usable and will save you enormous amounts of time. Highly recommended to all readers interested in management. The book is written in simple business US-English.	2003-08-10

Michael Lewis is the author of several entertaining books, such as Liar's Poker (1989), Next: The Future Just Happened (2001), Moneyball (2003).<br />The author explains that it was not his intention to write an autobiography about Jim Clark, but he was trying to capture the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley. However, due to the amazing enthusiasm of multiple entrepreneur Jim Clark Lewis ends up following Clark. Jim Clark, who originally was a technology professor, is the first person to start 3 companies that each exceed a market valuation of $1 billion each: Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon. The book starts with the maiden trial of Jim Clark's multi-million dollar yacht 'Hyperion'. This enormous yacht is full of (ridiculous) technology and should be able sail on its own. The trial of the 'Hyperion' is just the start of an almost endless list of crazy, wild stories about technology companies, Internet start-ups, and IPOs'. The author seems to have trouble keeping up with Jim Clark's ideas and (true) stories.<br />Yes, I do like this book. Although it mainly focuses on multi-entrepeneur Jim Clark, it also describes the stories behind various Internet-companies (AOL, Yahoo!, Microsoft, etc.) and the Internet bubble. The writing style of the author is extremely entertaining, while still containing lots of information and facts. The book feels like a rollercoaster, but it is great fun!! I recommend it highly.	2003-08-02

This book is split up in three parts, with each part consisting of three-to-nine chapters.<br />The first part is on management, &quot;that process by which the people who are formally in charge of whole organizations or part of them try to direct or at least to guide what they do.&quot; This section builds largely on Mintzberg's early work, in particular on his research as PhD-student. In these chapters, Mintzberg really knocks down some famous myths and folklore about management.<br />The second and largest part is on organizations. Much of this section is based on Mintzberg's research into trying to classify organizations, &quot;first from the perspective of structure and later from the perspective of power.&quot; There is an introduction into classification, seven chapters on each configuration, and a final chapter which looks at the broader issues of forces and forms in organizations.<br />The third and final part looks at our society of organizations and &quot;how we try to influence them and how they influence us in turn and thereby make our lives happy and miserable.&quot; It discusses the fact that organizations influence our lives in a great many ways.<br />Yes, this a great collection from Canadian-born management guru Henry Mintberg who has always been a very challenging author. Although this book has been split up in three parts, each chapter can be read on its own. Several chapters have been published in various magazines, with many winning different types of awards. I recommend this book to all people interested in management, but in particular to MBA-students. The book is written in simple business US-English.	2003-07-20

It has businesses ranging from music records and mobile phones through to balloon-flying and bridal services. This book is split up into 28 short chapters and a epilogue.<br />The book starts initially with Branson's failed around-the-world-ballooning attempt in Morocco in January 1997, before starting at his childhood. Richard Branson was born in the South of England in 1950, which is where he grew most of his childhood. &quot;My childhood is something of a blur to me now, but there are several episodes that stand out. I remember that my parents continually set challenges for us.&quot; During his time at a big public secondary school started thinking up schemes to make money. These schemes ranged from growing Christmas trees and breeding budgies; most of them leading nowhere. Eventually, his schoolfriend Jonny and Richard wanted to set up an alternative magazine aimed at students. &quot;The first issue of 'Student' was published in January 1968.&quot; This led to them setting up a music shop, leading to a record label, and eventually leading to one of the largest privately-owned companies in the world. Each of the different events is discussed in detail, while written in an novel-type style.<br />I normally do not read autobiographies, since I think most of them are &quot;ego-trips&quot;. Not this one however, I was surprised how honest Richard Branson was about his not always successful private life and business ventures. Since this book was first published in 1998, the life of Richard Branson has not been standing still. Therefore, be prepared for Volume II of the Sir Richard Branson-story.

Some additional examples were taken from the 'Value Line Investment Survey' between 1989 and fall 2000.    The 'Introduction' discusses business model innovation and the race for leadership and prosperity. \\"It is that business model obsolescence is THE major unperceived opportunity for and threat to all businesses now.\\" In the 'Prologue' they introduce some great examples of business model innovators, ranging from gold-mining Goldcorp to entertainment giant Disney(land).    In Part I - 'The Most Productive Areas for Business Model Innovation' the pleasure of this book really starts. Mitchell and Coles start discussing the areas where companies can improve their operations. They split these areas up in three. The first is increasing value without raising prices and costs; the second is to adjust pricing to increase sales profitably; and third, reduction of costs that reduce customers benefits. The authors use a wide range of examples to explain their points.Part II - 'Provide Sustained Benefits for All Stakeholders' discusses the difficult stage after the initial success of a business model innovation: The view that one success can threaten to dismantle the foundation of that success. The authors discuss methods for building a buffer for lean times and establishing a good ethical base for the company. They also discuss how leading business model innovators reward all stakeholders fairly in ways the stakeholders prefer.    In Part III - 'Expand Business Model Innovation', Mitchell and Coles explain that companies should never be satisfied with their current business model and should keep innovating. \\"Start first and stay focused on adding business model innovations to gain and keep a profitable competitive advantage.\\" There is also advise how to create a culture for nurturing ongoing business model innovation within organizations. These two issues should be seen as one of the highest priority on an executive's agenda.    The final part, 'Pursue Higher-Potential Business Model Improvement', discusses how you can improve a business model innovation. This sounds strange, but by looking closely at areas of high growth and profitability can lead to exceptional results. Another method is by closely looking at the benefits you can provide and share. Especially this last method is overlooked very often by successful companies and can ultimately lead to disastrous times. Finally, the 'Epilogue' provides the five principles which can guide companies to a positive future.    Yes, this is a good book. It is not just about innovation and idea creation, it also discusses the difficult second and further stages which are often overlooked. It fills you up with an enormous amounts of tips and ideas on how to improve your current or future business model. And I do believe that that is probably the strongest point of this book, you can feel the ideas and energy flowing into your body and mind and cannot wait to start implementing them into your organization. The authors have provided a short list of key questions at the of each chapter which you should ask yourself. I have just one minor comment: The term 'business model' could have been discussed in some greater detail - I refer to Joan Magretta's Harvard Business Article 'Why Business Models Matter?' (May 2002). Highly recommended to executives, managers, and, especially, entrepreneurs. The book is written in simple business US-English.	2003-04-07

Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I Sutton are Professors of Organizational Behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Stanford's School of Engineering, respectively. Jeffrey Pfeffer is a well-known author on management issues. This book consists of 8 chapters, plus a short appendix.<br />Chapter 1 - Knowing &quot;What&quot; to Do Is Not Enough serves as an introduction to the book. It introduces the 'knowing-doing problem' - &quot;the challenge of turning knowledge about how to enhance organizational performance into actions consistent with that knowledge.&quot; They discuss the methods they used during a 4-year crusade, whereby the authors have examined a wide range of organizational practices to learn about the knowing-doing gap. In chapters 2 to 6 they discuss the various issues that block organizations from implementing their knowledge. These are respectively: Talk as a substitute for action; memory as a substitute for thinking; fear preventing action; measurement obstructing good judgment; and internal competition resulting into fighting. Although the authors give some advice on methods to decrease the knowing-doing gap in these chapters, they do not really start providing solutions until chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 7 introduces case information on three firms (BP, Barclays Global Investors, and The New Zealand Post) that have been successful at either avoiding the knowing-doing gap or transcending barriers to turning knowledge into action. The final chapter is probably the most useful chapter of the complete book. Pfeffer and Sutton provide us with eight guidelines for action: (1) Why before how; (2) knowing comes from doing and teaching others how; (3) action counts more than elegant plans and concepts; (4) there is no doing without mistakes; (5) fear fosters knowing-doing gaps, so drive out fear; (6) beware of false analogies; (7) measure what matters and what can help turn knowledge into action; and (8) what leaders do matters.<br />Yes, I do like this book. It discusses a difficult but important issue in management and business - turning knowledge into action. The only disappointment of this book is that the authors spend about 200 pages discussing the issues that stop firms/managers/people from taking action and only 60 pages on methods for converting knowledge into effective action. In all honesty I would have rather seen it the other way around. The authors do have a very academic background and this is therefore visible in their writing style (business US-English).	2003-02-10

Galbraith is an internationally recognized expert on organization design. He is a Senior Research Scientist at the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California and Professor Emeritus at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne, Switzerland. This book is a updated/revised edition of 'Designing Organizations' which was originally published in 1995. It is split up into 10 chapters.<br />Chapter 1 - Introduction - really sets the stage for the rest of the book. It discusses the six main organization shapers: the increase buyer power; increase in the number of products and services; the Internet; multiple dimensions (functions, products, and geography, but also customer segments, solutions or offerings, and channels and processes); the requirement for a capacity to change; and speed (in bringing products and services to the market).<br />The following two chapters discuss how companies have to shape their organizational design, strategy, and structure in order how to deal with these organization shapers. Galbraith introduces his copyrighted Star Model (Strategy, structure, people, rewards, and processes), which looks AND sounds very similar to McKinsey's 7-S framework. Chapters 4 and 5 build on these chapter and discuss how organizations have to link their processes to coordination needs and integrate group processes. Then, in Chapter 6 discusses the easily changeable or reconfigurable organization based on the Star Model, which, according to Galbraith, results from the skilled use of three capabilities: (1) forming teams and networks across organizational departments; (2) the use of internal prices, markets, and marketlike devices to coordinate the complexity of multiple teams; and (3) the forming of partnerships to secure capabilities that it does not have. Each of these capabilities are discussed in detail.<br />The Chapters 7 to 10 are all very current and fashionable. They discuss the organizing around the customer, customer-focused structures, the design of the virtual corporation, and organizing the continuous design process. Although the subjects discussed are important, some of the examples are too long and take up most of the chapters. Some of the examples also do not really apply to every company/organization but are too specific. Still, these are issues that should not be forgotten about, especially organizing around the customer remains important.<br />I must admit that I am somewhat disappointed with this book, which is written by a leading authority in the field of organizational design. I believe it is especially the title that lets the book down. It is not so much a guide into strategies and structures; it more discusses the organization shapers and the possibilities that companies/organizations have to tackle the organization shapers. I believe that the book is especially weak in discussing organizational design and structures. Galbraith discusses his own Star-model (which reminds me of McKinsey's 7-S framework) and his reconfigurable organization (the learning organization?), but leaves all other models/designs/structures untouched. I have not been generous, the book really deserves a 3.5-star rating. The author uses simple business US-English.	2002-12-28

Kotter is Professor of Leadership at the Harvard Business School. He has written several books and articles on general management and leadership issues. This particular book builds on his 1995 Harvard Business Review-article 'Leading Change: Why Transformation Efforts Fail'.<br />The book is split up into three parts. In the first part - The Change Problem and Its Solution - Kotter discusses the eight main reasons why in many situations the improvements have been disappointing, with wasted resources and burned-out, scared, or frustrated employees. Each of these eight errors are discussed in detail, using simple, clear examples. \\"Making any of the eight errors in common to transformation efforts can have serious consequences.\\" But Kotter argues that these errors are not inevitable. And this is why Kotter has written this book. \\"The key lies in understanding why organizations resist needed change, what exactly is the multistage process that can overcome destructive inertia, and, most of all, how the leadership that is required to drive that process in a socially healthy way means more than good management.\\" In Chapter 2, Kotter discusses the reasons why organizations (can) need changes and improvements. Although some people suggest otherwise, Kotter believes that organizations can implement change successfully.  \\"The methods used in successful transformations are all based on one fundamental insight: that major change will not happen easily for a long list of reasons.\\" Kotter introduces an eight-stage process for creating major change.<br />This eight-stage process is discussed in Part Two of this book:<BR>(1) The first stage of the process involves the establishment of a sense of urgency, which is required to overcome complacency. The nine sources of complacency are discussed, whereby Kotter emphasizes that \\"a good rule of thumb in a major change effort is: Never underestimate the magnitude of the forces that reinforce complacency and that help maintain the status quo.\\" He further discusses methods for raising urgency levels, the role of crises, and the role of middle and lower-level managers.<BR>(2) The second stage involves the creation of a guiding coalition. \\"A strong guiding coalition is always needed - one with the right composition, level of trust, and shared objective.\\" According to the author the four key characteristics to effective guiding coalition are position power, expertise, credibility, and leadership. And he emphasizes that management and leadership must work in tandem, teamwork style. <BR>(3) The third stage requires the development of a vision and strategy. Good vision clarifies the general direction for change, motivates people to take action in the right direction, and it helps coordinate people's actions. The characteristics of an effective vision are imaginable, desirable, feasible, focused, flexible, and communicable. But vision alone is not enough. \\"This is where strategy plays an important role. Strategy provides both logic and a first level detail to show how a vision can be accomplished.\\"<BR>(4) The power of a vision is most powerful when all people within an organization have a common understanding of its goals and direction. Although the general myth is that failures to communicate vision are attributed to either limited intellectual capabilities among lower-level employees or a general human resistance to change. But that is not really the problem. The vision needs to be communicated in a clear, simple message (focused and jargon-free). Kotter discusses each of the seven key elements in the communication of vision.<BR>(5) Empowering employees for broad-based action - \\"Discouraged and disempowered employees never make enterprises winners in a globalizing economic environment. But with the right structure, training, systems, and supervisors to build on a well-communicated vision, increasing numbers of firms are finding that they can tap an enormous source of power to improve organizationalperformance. They can mobilize hundreds or thousands of people to help provide leadership to produce needed changes.\\"<BR>(6) Major change takes time and it is therefore advisable to pay serious attention to short-term wins. Short-term wins should be visible, unambiguous, and related to the change effort. Short-term wins play various roles in a change effort, most notably building the necessary momentum.<BR>(7) Many forces can stall a change process short of the finish line. And we should be aware that irrational and political resistance to change never fully dissipates. We should not let the celebration of short-term wins allow complacency back into the organization. We should also be aware that progress can slip away for two reasons: corporate culture (see more in the next stage) and increased interdependence as a result from interconnections.<BR>(8) \\"Culture refers to norms of behavior and shared values among a group of people.\\" In large organizations, there are some social forces (corporate culture) that affect everyone. Corporate cultures have a powerful influence on human behavior, since it is almost impossible to change and invisible. Kotter believes that \\"culture is powerful for three reasons: (i) Because individuals are selected and indoctrinated so well. (ii) Because the culture exerts itself through the actions of hundreds or thousands of people. (iii) Because all of this happens without much conscious intent and thus is difficult to challenge or even discuss.\\" He provides with one other important warning: \\"most cultural change happens in stage 8, not stage 1.\\"<br />Part III - Implications for the Twenty-First Century - consists of two chapters. In the first chapter, Kotter discusses the organization of the future. In particular, the impact of the future on the eight stages in the change process. There is an interesting table, which compares the differences in structure, systems, and culture between 20th-century and 21st-century organizations. \\"The key tocreating and sustaining the kind of successful 21st-century organization is leadership - not only at the top of the hierarchy, with a capital L, but also in a more modest sense (l) throughout the enterprise.\\" These two notions are discussed in detail in the final chapter of the book.<br />Yes, this is an excellent book on controlling change. The book provides an extremely useful framework for a change process and should be kept as a checklist. Although the process looks rigid, the stages are flexible and take place concurrently. I recommend this book to all people involved in a major change process within larger organizations. The author uses simple business US-English.	2002-08-17

He has won 76 singles titles, of which 7 Grand Slam, and 76 doubles titles. Nowadays he is one of the best (perhaps even the best) tennis commentator.<br />In this book McEnroe discusses his childhood, his rise to tennis fame and success, his fantastic 1980 and 1981 Wimbledon-finals against Bjorn Borg, his marriage to actress Tatum O'Neal, becoming a father (eventually six times!), his slow slide down the rankings, his divorce from Tatum O'Neal, his rock 'n roll career, the start of his art gallery in New York, meeting his second wife Patty Smyth, and being a father of six children. He also discusses his current work as tennis commentator for both US and UK television.<br />Although I am/was a huge John McEnroe-fan I am slightly disappointed with this autobiography. Yes, it does shine some light on the magical tennis player, but it does not go very deep. There are not many details and he remains mostly at the surface. In all honesty, he comes across as selfish and childish (for example: his divorce from Tatum O'Neal was her fault, his slide down the tennis rankings was also not his own fault.) Just like some other readers I expected more as that is what autobiographies are about. However, for John McEnroe-fans like myself it is a MUST.	2002-07-11
US	49458047	R1QBXZPG92BX02	0812931912	424197675	AOL.com	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Part one of the history of America Online (AOL.com)	Kara Swisher has covered AOL and the Internet for the business section of The Washington Post since 1994. Now reporting on Silicon Valley for The Wall Street Journal, she lives in San Francisco. This updated version, published in 1999, included an new epilogue by the author.<br />The book starts with the now legendary meeting between the world-richest man Bill Gates (founder and chairman of Microsoft) and Steve Case (now chairman of AOL) in May 1993. In this meeting, Gates makes the following proposal to Case: \\"I can buy 20 percent of you or I can buy all of you, or I can go into this business myself and bury you.\\" In hindsight, we now know that Gates did not buy America Online and did not bury them either. With this conversation in the background Swisher discusses the roots, the lack of business plan, the strategy changes (through which AOl got the nickname cockroach: \\"... a bug you couldn't kill no matter how hard you tried.\\"), the people involved, the battles with Microsoft, Prodigy and CompuServe, the financial problems, the legal problems, the acquisitions of Netscape and various other companies, and Steve Case's vision (the three C's - \\"communication, community, clarity\\"). Most of the information comes from inside the company itself, where Swisher has interviewed the numerous people involved, but as a Washington Post-journalist there is plenty of external information.<br />Although this excellent book is about one of the best-known brands in cyberspace, it is perfectly readable for non-Internet geeks (like me). Yes, yes, I know, there are plenty of names and Internet terms around, but that doesn't even make this a bad and difficult read. I see this book as the first part in the history of America Online (AOL), from pre-startup through to late-1998. But plenty has happened since 1998 and I do expect the author to write another book on those events?!?	2002-04-01

He was named 'the most powerful man in sports' by Sports Illustrated.<br />In this book McCormack does not so much criticize Harvard Business School as the title suggests, but complements the traditional business school-education with 'street smarts' - \\"the ability to make active, positive use of your instincts, insights, and perceptions.\\" (Funnily enough, McCormack did not even attend the HBS, he has a law degree from Yale.) \\"My main purpose in writing this book is to fill in many of the gaps - the gaps between a business school education and the street knowledge that comes from day-to-day experience of running a business and managing people.\\" He splits the 'street smarts' and this book up into three parts: People, sales and negotiation, and running a business. With each part consisting of 4-to-6 chapters.<br />In the first part McCormack discusses matters related to people, such as reading people, creating impressions, preparation for business situations, and improving your career. \\"Business situations always come down to people situations. And the more - and the sooner - I know about the person I am dealing with, the more effective I'm going to be.\\" In the second part of the book - Sales and Negotiation - the author dicusses sales, negotiations and marketing. Sales and negotiations are probably the strongest point of both the book and McCormack, he really excels here. ...The third part of the book - Running a Business - is probably the weakest part of the book. Although there are some great one-liners, it is clear that the author is not that much at ease with writing about organization structures, policies and procedures. In fact, it looks like he despises most of these subjects. However, in the final chapter he provides some good advice for entrepreneurs and people thinking about starting their own business.<br />Yes, I do like this book. It is somewhatunconventional and is not really a business/management book. The examples from his experiences in sports marketing are exceptional and extremely useful. And yes, it is a great complement to the traditional business school-education (although they are now covering some of the subjects McCormack discusses, under the term 'emotional intelligence'). It is very simple to read and relatively short (250 pages). Recommended to managers and, yes also, MBA-students.	2002-03-27

He has been described as \\"Mr. Strategy\\" and has written several books and articles on strategy-related topics.<br />Kenichi Ohmae believes that successful business strategies do not result from rigorous analysis but from a particular state of mind. \\"In what I call the mind of the strategist, insight and consequent drive for achievement, often amounting to a sense of mission, fuel a thought process which is basically creative and intuitive rather than rational.\\" He uses theoretical knowledge from the various academic scholars and puts them in its place - \\"a place distinctly secondary to creative intuition in the tool kit of the successful strategist.\\" The book split up in three parts, each consisting of 5 to 7 chapters.<br />In Part I - The Art of Strategic Thinking, the author concentrates on the basics of the mental process. In Chapter 1 - Analysis: The Starting Point, Ohmae introduces the strategic thinking process. He introduces various useful diagrams and flow processes for a more reliable recipe for success: \\"the combination of analytical method and mental elasticity that I call strategic thinking.\\" In the chapters 2 to 6, the author explores the different directions the strategic thinker can pursue in quest of innovative strategies. In the final chapter of Part I, Ohmae explains how the right mindset for strategic thinking and how to develop the required strategy.<br />In Part II - Building Successful Strategies, Ohmae shifts his focus from process to content. \\"In the construction of any business strategy, three main players must be taken into account: the corporation itself, the customer, and the competition.\\" He refers to them as the three C's or the strategic triangle. Within the next three chapters, Ohmae discusses the strategies based on those three C's: (1) \\"Customer-based strategies are the basis of all strategy. ... There is no doubt that a corporation's foremost concern ought to be the interest of its customers rather than that of its stockholders and other parties. In the long run, the corporation that is genuinely interested in its customers is the one that will be interesting to investors.\\" (2) \\"Corporate-based strategies are functional. Their aim to maximize the corporation's strenghts relative to the competition in the functional areas that are critical to success in the industry.\\" (3) \\"Competitor-based strategies can be constructed by looking at possible sources of differentiation in functions ranging from purchasing, design, and engineering to sales and servicing. The main point to remember is that any difference between you and your competitors must be related to one or more of the three elements that jointly determine profit: price, volume, and cost.\\" In the final chapter of Part II, Ohmae discusses corporate strategy. He claims that corporate strategy needs to address two issues: First, the integration between the individual business and the total corporation. And second, should there be a corporate strategy that is different from the individual business.<br />Part III - Modern Strategic Realities discusses the environmental factors influencing strategy thinking and strategy formulation. The chapters in this part are not as much related to each other as the previous parts. Ohmae identifies and discusses five economic trends that have an impact on long-term business strategies, whereby he notes that the strategic thinker needs to take those trends into consideration when shaping strategies. Due to those economic trends, seven major changes are ongoing in a global perspective. Ohmae discusses those seven changes in a very interesting chapter 14. In the next chapter, the author discusses the various myths and realities about Japan products and Japanese companies, and discusses the four main differences between Japanese and Western companies. This chapter provides some great insights into Japanese strategic and business thinking. In Chapter 16, Ohmae tackles strategic decision making. Ohmae believes that founders of successful businesses do not simply gamble. In his opinion entrepreneurs follow a five-step process for successful, foresighted management decision making: (1) Clear definition of the business domain. (2) Logical hypothesis based on an extrapolation of forces at work in the business environment. (3) Focus on a few strategic options, instead of many, open to the business. (4) The company must pace its strategy and not overreach itself. (5) Management must be prepared to change the basic direction of the business, if conditions demand it. Each of these five steps are discussed in detail. In the final chapter of the book, the author discusses strategy formulation: \\"... to bring insight to fruition as a successful strategy takes method, mental discipline, and plain hard work.\\" He also discusses the creativity required for the development of business strategy.<br />Yes, I do like this book. And yes, I do find it difficult to write a review about it. This book is not a guide or framework into Japanese strategic thinking. In fact, Ohmae only really spends one chapter on the difference between Japanese and Western business systems. It is more about the right mind-set for strategy formulation and strategy development. There are some great lines in this book, and the various figures, diagrams and sketches are extremely useful. I wish that I had read this book several years ago as it gives great insights into the strategy process and development. But again, this book is not a guide or framework. It is an excellent complement to books such Porter's 'Competitive Strategy' (1980) and 'Competitive Advantage' (1985). Highly recommended to anybody interested in strategic management and strategy development/process. The authors uses a very simple US-English writing style.se strategic and business thinking.

This book is really split up into three parts: (1) An introduction into the research.; (2) The core ideology of visionary companies.; (3) The habits of visionary companies; (4) Methods for implementation.    The authors explain their research methods of this six-year research project into visionary companies. \\"Visionary companies are premier institutions - the crown jewels - in their industries, widely admired by their peers and having a long track record of making a significant impact on the world around them.\\" The authors used the term 'visionary', rather than just 'successful' or 'enduring', to reflect the fact they have distinguished themselves as a very special and elite breed of institutions. In order to compose these visionary companies the authors started with a set of criteria which those companies had to meet: (1) Premier institution in its industry; (2) widely admired by knowledgeable businesspeople; (3) made an indelible imprint on the world in which we live; (4) had multiple generations of chief executives; (5) been through multiple product (or service) life cycles; (6) founded before 1950. With these criteria in mind the authors select 18 visionary companies from a wide range of industries, plus 18 comparison companies (which are not weak or bad companies either).    So what do these visionary companies have in common? They have core ideologies consisting of more than a bunch of nice-sounding platitudes. A visionary company's core ideology consists of core values (\\"The organization's essential and enduring tenets\\") and purpose (\\"The organization's fundamental reasons for existence beyond just making money\\"). But the authors comment that ocre ideology alone cannot make a visionary company. Ultimately, a visionary company is build up from a core ideology complemented with a drive for progress and a preservation of the core complemented with a stimulation for progress.    The authors then turn their attention to the specific methods of preserving the core and stimulating progress that distinguishes visionary companies from the comparison companies. They split these methods up into: (1) Big hairy audaciou goals (BHAGs) (\\"Commitment to challenging, audicious goals and projects toward which a visionary company channels its efforts.\\"); (2) Cult-like cultures (\\"Great places to work only for those who buy in to the core ideology; those who don't fit the ideology are ejected like a virus (preserves the core).\\"); (3)Try a lot of stuff and keep what works (\\"High levels of action and experimentation that produce new and unexpected paths of progress and enables visionary companies to mimic the biological evolution of specias (stimulates progress).\\"); (4) Home-grown management (\\"Promotion from within, bringing to senior levels only those who've spent significant time steeped in the coe ideology of the company (preserves the core).\\"); and (5) Good enough never is (\\"A continual process of relentless self-improvement with the aim of doing better and better, forever into the future (stimulate progress).\\")    In the final chapters the authors provide a summary of the book, which they refer to as the vision framework: Articulating a vision = core ideology (core values and core purpose) + envisioned future (10 to 30 year BHAG and vivid descriptions). There are also some tools to create all these items in this framework. In this 3rd edition there is also 'a message for the new economy' in which the authors conclude that the dot-com craze is based on 'Built to Flip' and not 'Built to Last' ideas. They provide some questions for to check whether your organization is built to last or built to flip. This chapter is a waste paper.    This is a good book into the habits of successful companies, although the habits are somewhat 'soft', and difficult to implement inexisting companies. The biggest criticism McKinsey & Co had on this book: \\"We really love 'Built to Last' here, but unfortunately it's useless. ... all the companies in 'Built to Last' were always great. They were never average. But that's most of the world.\\" As an reply to this criticism Collins has recently written 'Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't' (2001). My greatest criticism on this book is the amount of repetition and therefore I recommend others to go for the e-articles 'Build Your Company's Vision' and 'Turning Goals into Results', both by the authors of this book. I also recommend Jim Collins' latest article 'Level 5 Leadership' (2001) which is based on his latest book 'Good to Great'. This book is written in simple US-English.	2002-02-06

Peters and Robert H. Waterman Jr. were consultants with McKinsey & Co. when this book was published in 1982. This book shot both authors into management guru-dom and is still one of the greatest management bestsellers ever. Both authors have written other books, but none have come close to this one.<br />In this book, the authors report on the findings from the excellent companies: \\"It will define what we mean by excellence. It is an attempt to generalize about what the excellent companies seem to be doing that the rest are not, and to buttress our observations on the excellent companies with sound social and economic theory.\\" The authors' research started in 1977 when two internal task forces at McKinsey & Co. were set up to research a general concern with the problems of management effectiveness, and a particular concern with the nature of the relationship between strategy, structure, and management effectiveness. One of these task forces was to review thinking on strategy, the other was to review thinking on organizational effectiveness. Peters and Waterman were the leaders of the project on organizational effectiveness. Their research involved talking extensively with executives around the world and extensive literature reviews. Initially they worked mainly on the problem of expanding our diagnostic and remedial kit beyond the traditional tools for business problem solving, which then concentrated on strategy and structural approaches. This resulted in the now well-renowned 7-S framework (structure, strategy, systems, shared values, skills, style, and staff). \\"But there was still something missing. ... we were shore on practical design ideas, especially for the 'soft S's'.\\" So the authors decided to look at management excellence itself. \\"We asserted that innovative companies not only are unusually good at producing commercially viable new widgets; innovative companies are especially adroit at continually responding to change of any sort in their environment.\\" The authors labeled the companies that seemed to have achieved that kind of innovative performance as excellent companies.<br />The authors eventually chose 75 highly regarded companies, in which they conducted intense, structured interviews. Their project showed that the excellent companies were, above all, brilliant on the basics. The authors use eight chapters to discuss in detail the eight attributes that distinct excellent, innovative companies: 1. A bias for action, for getting on with it; 2. Close to the customer; 3. Autonomy and entrepreneurship; 4. Productivity through people; 5. Hands-on, value driven; 6. Stick to the knitting; 7. Simple form, lean staff; 8. Simultaneous loose-tight properties. None of these eight attributes are something special. In fact, they can even be called simple and predictable and the authors refer to them as \\"motherhoods\\". Most essential to each of these excellent companies is the intensity within them. This intensity is build on the strongly held beliefs of these companies.<br />Yes, I do like this book. I must admit that I had heard plenty about this book and had read several reviews before I actually started reading it. The biggest criticism I heard was that the example companies are not so excellent now. Perhaps true, but I do not think that this book is that much about the excellent companies themselves. I believe that it is much more about the attitude of the example companies, the positive culture. Highly recommended to business leaders, managers, and MBA-students. Read it sooner rather than later. The book is written in simple US-English, although it contains quite a heavy literature review.	2002-01-26

Books	2	20	22	N	N	From ordinary task to cool, sexy, memorable WOW! projects	Tom Peters is an ex-McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant, who become a management guru by being the co-author of business super-bestseller 'In Search of Excellence' (1982). He has written several books after that huge success, but nothing has come close in quality. This (little) book is part of his 'Reinventing Work' series.<br />The aim of this book is to make us &quot;believe that work can be cool. That the work matters.&quot; The reason? &quot;Work - yours and mine - as we know it today will be reinvented in the next ten years.&quot; Perhaps you believe this, but I do not. Yes, we can make work and, in this case, projects more interesting. Tom Peters comes up with a list of 50 ways how to do this. The list is split up in four parts: (1) Create; (2) Sell; (3) Implement; and (4) Exit. Each of the 50 ways raised consists of a short introduction, the main point (&quot;the nub&quot;), the impact, and some examples and quotes. Most of the 50 ways are quite interesting, but they could have been cut down to some 25.<br />I always feel disappointed when I have to write a negative review, but this time I have no choice. Tom Peters is a famous management guru and an excellent motivational speaker. I feel that he tries to bring his famous energy from his seminars across by using plenty of capitals, wild colors, abbreviations, and exclamation marks. But it just does not work (for me). There are some interesting points, but he would have been better by producing a video of his seminars or writing a proper book - like 'In Search of Excellence' (1982) - on projects. For people interested in projects and project management there is plenty of choice elsewhere. Although the book is small and consists of only 200 pages, the book is not that simple to read due to its format and structure.	2002-01-06

Porter is a Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and a leading authority on competition and strategic management. Porter is the author of the legendary business and management books 'Competitive Strategy' (1980), and 'Competitive Advantage' (1985). I cannot start this review without a word of warning: This book is consists of 850 pages and is thus not a quick weekend-read.<br />In this book, the author aims to answer the question, &quot;Why do some social groups, economic institutions, and nations advance and prosper? ... I titled the book 'The Competitive Advantage of Nations' to highlight the crucial distinction between my broader concept of competitive advantage as a source of wealth and the nation of comparative advantage which had long dominated thinking about international competition.&quot; In order to answer this question, Porter uses his traditional extensive research methods and tools to prove his point.<br />The book is split up in four parts: (i) foundations; (2) industries; (3) nations; and (4) implications. In Chapter 1 - The Need for a New Paradigm, the author discusses the reasons for his research: &quot;The central question to be answered is why do firms based in particular nations achieve international success in distinct segments and industries? The search is for the decisive characteristics of a nation that allow its firms to create and sustain competitive advantage in particular fields, that is, the competitive advantage of nations.&quot;<br />In Part I - Foundations, the author presents the theoretical frameworks which form the basis for the rest of the book. In Chapters 2, 3 and 4 Porter revisits most of his previous work, such as the five competitive forces, generic strategies, the value chain, and the advantages &quot;diamond&quot;. Porter makes an important notion before turning the second part of the book: &quot;The theory can and must be applied at two levels, the industry and the nation.&quot;<br />In Part II - Industries, the frameworks of Part I are applied to explain the histories of four industries (German printing press, American patient monitoring equipment, Italian ceramic tiles, and Japanese robotics). In addition, Porter applies the frameworks to the service sector. This is a sector which Porter has discussed very little in his previous books. &quot;... an increasingly important class of industries where international competition has not been widely studied.&quot;<br />In Part III - Nations, the frameworks of Part I are applied to ten nations. Porter splits these ten nations up in early post-war winners, emerging nations in the 1970s and 1980s, and the traditional business countries (Britain and USA). Thank God, the author discusses both successes and failures within the different countries, plus identifying the reasons behind them. He also advises which steps can be taken to improve national advantage.<br />In Part IV - Implications, Porter discusses the impact of the frameworks of Part I on company's strategies and government policies. In the final chapter Porter tries to answer the question, &quot;What of the future?&quot;  According to Porter &quot;the central economic concern of every nation should be the capacity of its economy to upgrade so that firms achieve more sophisticated competitive advantages and higher productivity. Only in this way can there be a rising standard of living and economic prosperity.&quot;<br />This book is an impressive piece of research and Porter gets assistance from over 30 research assistants from all around the world. The book is not a simple read due to the amount of information provided and the length of the book. For readers who have read Porter's previous masterpieces I would like to stress that this book is considerably different than his previous masterpieces. It focuses less on industries and companies themselves, but more on national, international, and governmental issues. This book shows the author's education and training (Harvard PhD in economics). Still, the book is an impressive piece of work, although not for the fainthearted.	2001-12-11

Books	3	7	11	N	N	Reviving the competitive advantage of Japan	Michael Porter is Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and a leading authority on competition and strategic management; Hirotaka Takeuchi is Professor and Dean of the new Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy at Hitotsubashi University in Japan; and Mariko Sakakibara is Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.<br />&quot;This book aims first and foremost to offer a theory that can explain and interpret Japan's postware economic trajectory.&quot; This 'theory' follows a mostly academical and economical research method. In Chapter 1 the authors first discuss Japan's economical history, whereby the authors use extensive graphs, figures and tables to prove their point: &quot;Japan's actual competitive performance, then, has been mixed for decades.&quot; Expanding on their discussion on the economical history, the authors challenge the Japanese government model. &quot;At the core of the Japanese government model is a particular conception of the process of economic development and the bases of competitiveness. It embodies an implicit aversion to certain forms of competition and an effort to channel competition in various ways.&quot; This model goes back to the early post-World War II period, when &quot;the nation was in shambles&quot;. There is an 12 developmental policies list which form the building blocks of the Japanese governmental model. The authors discuss the impact of these policies on Japan's successes and failures.<br />In Chapter 3, the authors discuss Japan's unique management model. &quot;The model stresses attributes such as teamwork, a long time horizon, and dedication to continuous quality improvement, all of which remain important Japanese strengths. But it has also encouraged conformity and a conception of competition that is dangerously incomplete.&quot; Again, the authors introduce a list of policies which are typical for the Japanese corporate model. The authors' biggest complaint is that most Japanese companies do not have a strategy, they tend to compete on operational effectiveness. (For more see Porter's 1996-article 'What is Strategy?')<br />In Chapter 4 the authors try to explain Japanese competitiveness. This model for competitiveness follows the universal model: &quot;vigorous competition in a supportive business environment, free of government direction, is the only path to economic vitality.&quot; Most of this chapter is directly taken from Porter's 1990-book 'The Competitive Advantage of Nations', discussing various industries (both successful and unsuccessful).<br />In Chapter 5, 6, and 7 the authors aim to come up with an answer to move Japan forward. The authors discuss the requirements for both government and companies. &quot;What is needed is nothing short of a new economic strategy, one that builds on the true bases of Japan's past success, recognizes the differences between the country's rebuilding challenges and its present circumstances, and addresses the realities of modern global competition.&quot; So can Japan compete? The authors believe it can. &quot;Japan has a history of competing successfully at the highest level and rapidly advancing national productivity, when competition was allowed to proceed unfettered. ... Japan can compete. To do so, however, it will require the systematic changes in both business and government we have described. ... As it has shown in earlier periods of transition, if mind-sets change, Japan has the capacty to move rapidly.&quot;<br />Yes, I do understand the disappointment of some of the other readers. In line with Michael Porter's 'The Competitive Advantage of Nations' (1990) this book is more about governmental issues than the activities within companies as in Porter's bestsellers 'Competitive Strategy' (1980) and 'Competitive Advantage' (1985). In their search for their answer to the title-question (Can Japan Compete?) the authors use an mostly academical and economical approach, which can be daunting to some readers. The book is mostly aimed at Japanese multinationals, economists, and governmental officials, and includes some strong critical comments toward their policies.	2001-12-11

Gary Hamel is a top business writer/management guru, fellow at Harvard Business School, visiting professor at the London Business School, and chairman of California-based consulting firm Strategos. Both have written several business-related books.<br />The book starts with an introduction by Gary Hamel, who lists the books featured per issues - management, leadership, complexity, people, customerd, global, the future, renewal, competition, efficiency, strategy, and fun. Then, Stuart Crainer describes 50 management and business classics in alphabetical order of the authors. The classics featured range from Sun Tzu's Art of War (500 BC) and Machiavelli's The Prince (1513) through to modern works from Gary Hamel, Michael Porter, Peter Senge and Tom Peters. I do not think that anybody will argue the author's selection, since all books are truly greats. Since the complete book consists about 300 pages, each classic receives about 4-6 pages (introduction by Gary Hamel, biography of author(s), and a description of the main ideas and issues). This is enough for a quick insight and description, but do not expect to become a specialist in any of the issues.<br />The breakdown into issues makes it easy for readers to choose a subject/books. You can then have a quick flick through the particular summary/summaries. If you like the summary/summaries, you will still require to purchase or borrow the book(s) since the summaries are not that detailed. I used this book during my MBA-course (in particular during the earlier part), where I used it as a type of tool since it pointed me to the best book(s) for a particular subject. (I must admit that I also bought Stuart Crainer's 110 Ultimate Book of Business Gurus, but I do much more prefer/use this one.) The book is simple to use and is written in simple US-English.	2001-08-04

Both are specialists in the field of competence-based management, a stream of strategic management which was started by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad in the early 1990s (read their book Competing for the Future, 1994). This book is part of a series by the Strategic Management Society and consists of 5 sections with 2-to-5 chapters each. Most chapters are written by academics.<br />In Section I - Competence Concepts for Strategic Management - the editors introduce the fundamental concept and current issues in the competence-based management field and provides suggestions for linking theory with practice. It provides a summary of the previous book in this series (Hamel and Heene (1994), Competence-Based Competition).<br />Section II - Competence Dynamics - which is the largest part of the book with 5 chapters, explores the dynamics of competence-based management. It describes the processes for strategic renewal in large organizations, the role of customers in stimulating organizational change, the role of innovation, the organizational capacity to change, and strategies for defending existing competences.<br />The two chapters in Section III - Competence Systemics - investigate approaches for managing competences in a systematic way. The first chapter presents an useful framework for analyzing competences at different levels within a firm. The second chapter introduces, through a case study at the Merlin Gerin-Groupe Schneider - a large French company, the integration of competence-building with corporate strategy.<br />Section IV - Cognition in Managing Competences - explores the key processes for managing the cognitions of decision makers. The two chapters detail the expected forms of &quot;blind spots&quot; in managerial cognitions about competences and processes for stimulating the building of new competences.<br />The final section, Section V - Holism in Managing Competences, concludes with a holistic perspective on competence. The two chapters suggest theoretical and practical approaches to achieving organizational coherence, as well as the need to develop a more reflective, philosophical visouns of the firm as an organization.<br />This book is a collection of 14 impressive chapters from academics from all around the world, therefore some readers will miss the practical perspective. It is not a simple book to read, since it uses difficult business-school US-English, but chapters can be read on a stand-alone basis. I would recommend this book to second-year MBA-students and academics interested in this particular field.	2001-07-05

The book is split in 4 parts, each consisting of 3-to-5 stand-alone chapters.<br><br>Part I - Understanding Advantages in a Changing Competitive Environment - discusses competitive arenas, competitor analysis, and competitive advantage. The first two chapters expand largely on Michael Porter's (Harvard Business School) frameworks, whereby the other two chapters introduce approaches to include policy and technology trends into the strategic planning process.<br><br>The aim of Part II - Anticipating Competitors' Actions - is to get inside the heads of competitors. Chapters 5 and 6 explain the possible use of the game theory within competitive strate!gy and strategic decision making. Chapter 7 builds on these chapters to integrate the economic frame (chapter 5), the behavioral frame (chapter 6), with an coevolution frame. The final chapters of this part introduce frameworks and approaches to understanding competitor response and competitive relationships.<br><br>Part III - Formulating Dynamic Competitive Strategies - builds on the first two parts and introduces approaches to designing strategies. It introduces reactive strategies, preemptive strategies, signaling opportunities and uses, competitive positioning, and antitrust constraints (which is increasingly important to companies).<br><br>In Part IV - Choosing Among Alternative Competitive Strategies - the three chapters introduce methods and frameworks for choosing the right strategy. Chapter 15, in which conjoint analysis is combined with scenario analysis, is perhaps the most complicated chapter of the book. Part IV also introduces the possibilities to use simulation !tests for analyzing andtesting strategies.<br><br>Although this book is named \\"Wharton on Dynamic Competitive Strategy\\", there are various chapters from other academic institutions. Each chapter is an excellent piece of work and can be read on a stand-alone basis. For beginners in the strategic field I recommend chapters 1 and 2 highly. The book is written in business US-English.	2001-07-01

Rodney Turner was Director of Project Management at Henley Management College (UK), where he used to run an MBA programme for project-based management. In 2001, he was Professor of Project Management at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Netherlands. This book is part of the Henley Management Series and is split up six parts, with each part consisting of 2-to-7 chapters.<br />Part I - Introduction - provides an introduction into project management. Chapter I explains the difference between projects and operations, project objectives (managing scope, organization, quality, cost, and time), and the three dimensions of project management (objectives, management processes, and levels). Turner also gives an introduction into the structured approach to the management of projects, which is the basis/structure of the total book. This chapter is perhaps the most essential of the complete book.<br />Part II - The Context of Projects - describes the different settings of projects. The author describes projects for implementing corporate strategy, possible relationhip(s) to the parent organization, and strategic management of projects. These chapters are especially useful for specialists in order to understand and appreciate the place of projects within the overall organization.<br />Part III - Managing the Project Objectives - is the most comprehensive part of the book. It introduces methods, tools and techniques for managing the first dimension of project management, the five project objectives: scope, project organization, quality, cost, time, and the inherent risk. It also explains how to balance the systems and project objectives. Although most tools are explained in detail, there is better literature available for management of these methods, tools and techniques.<br />Part IV - Undertaking Projects - turns to the second dimension of project management, the management processes, and describes how the methods, tools, and techniques explained in Part III are applied toundertake project. It describes project definition, from project start-up via proposal and initiation, feasibility studies, design and appraisal, to the launch of the project. This Part III also discusses the execution and control, and the finalization and close-out of the project(s).<br />In Part V - Management Procedures and Systems, Turner describes how the tools and techniques from Parts II to IV have become formalized into standard systems and procedures. He explains some of the administrative procedures used and how they have been computerized into project management information systems. The author also look at what the systems can do, the different types of system available, and how to select and implement a system. The final chapter of this Part discusses the role of the project manager in building and maintaining the project team.<br />Part VI - Applications - compares the application of the processes introduced in the previous four Part to different types of projects. Turner classifies projects against three parameters: the position of the project in the life cycle of the product, the type of industry or technology of the project/parent organization, and the size of the project. The final chapter considers projects involving international collaboration and how different cultural approaches can conflict during the project management life cycle.<br />The book is useful as a starting point for students and as a reference for people experienced in project management. I personally keep the book as a reference (in combination with the Project Management Institute's Guide to the Project Management Book of Knowledge), but use additional, more detailed, literature for the different parts of the book. Please be aware that this book is written by an author with a engineering/construction-background so most of the examples are from these industries. Also note that the book is a very extensive piece of work consisting of 22 chapters, some 514 pages, and lots of figures and tables, so do not think that you can read it within a day.	2001-07-01

Frederick Winslow Taylor comes straight to the point when he explains the reason for writing the book: First, &quot;to point out the great loss which the whole country is suffering through inefficiency in almost all of our daily acts&quot;. Second, &quot;to try to convince the reader that the remedy for this inefficiency lies in systematic management, rather than in searching for some unusual or extraordinary man&quot;. Third, &quot;to prove that the best management is a true science, resting upon clearly defined laws, rules, and principles, as a foundation&quot;.<br />However, this starting point does not set the tone for the rest of the book. Taylor and his Taylorism/task management is more human than most people will tell you. This can be seen from the first page of the first chapter, where Taylor explains the principal of object of management, which &quot;should be to secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for each employee&quot;.<br />Initially, Taylor starts with a short introduction and reasons  of &quot;soldiering&quot; which he refers to as &quot;deliberately working slowly as as to avoid doing a full day's work&quot;. Taylor then turns to his now-famous Scientific Management. The four elements which constitute the essence of scientific management are: First, the development of standardization of methods. Second, the careful selection and training of personnel. Third, extensive supervision by management and payment of bonuses. Fourth, an equal division of the work and responsibility between the workman and the management. Taylor uses some somewhat old-fashioned examples to explain task-management, such as pig-iron handling, bricklaying, and inspection of bicycle balls.<br />Just like other readers I expected something different from this book, since much of what is said about this book on MBA and management-courses is not true. I did enjoy reading this book, even though it is now somewhat out of date (originallypublished 1911), but it is amazing how much scientific management is still around us and the influence it still has on modern management (business process reengineering). It is written in simple English and is very thin for a management book with just 140 pages.	2001-03-31

This book consists of 13 chapters and an excellent glossary at the end. The book provides a clear introduction into the various possibilities of electronic commerce (e-commerce).<br><br>Although most people think e-commerce/Internet is still very young, it has been around since the 1960s. In Chapter 1, the author starts with a short historic review of electronic commerce and what it is. \\"To many, electronic commerce is defined as buying and selling of products and services over the Internet, but there are many more aspects.\\" The author also introduces a very useful comparison between traditional and electronic business transactions. Chapter 2 - The Importance of the Internet - discusses the network infrastructure of the Internet, the various protocols (TCP/IP, application protocols), and other possible networks (intranet, shared data!bases, extranet). In Chapter 3, the authors discusses how financial transactions (can) take place on the Internet, the requirements of payment systems, types of electronic payments, and the tools for implementation. Chapter 4 - Security and Electronic Commerce - is for many people probably the most boring one, but for others it is essential. Kosiur introduces an overview of cryptographic background and then discusses the principal standards to secure the Internet for electronic commerce.<br><br>Chapter 5 - Consumer and Busines Markets - is really part 2 of the book. The author now really starts to introduce how business can use the various available technologies to actually conduct electronic commerce. Chapters 6 to 11 introduce different case-studies which are build on this chapter. Chapter 6 uses Gateway, the supplier of personal computers, as an example company to show how companies can offer products on the Internet. Chapter 7 introduces Nets Inc.'s approach to building a !marketplace of businessby facilitating the transacitons between buyers and sellers. Chapter 8 shows how underwear business Fruit of the Loom integrated their distribution chain. Chapter 9 explains how companies can build an Online catalog. Chapter 10 provides examples of electronic customer support, while Chapter 11 explains the possibility of the virtual factory.<br><br>Chapter 12 - Strategies for Electronic Commerce - provides excellent guidance for integrating electronic commerce into existing businesses, whereby it \\"should focus on information - not only its collection and dissemination, but also its use in marketing and as a salable product in and of itself.\\" The author uses the final chapter, Chapter 13 - The Future of Electronic Commerce - to provide his personal view on the future of electronic commerce. Basically, what is happening right now (2000/2001).<br><br>I gave the book a 3 star-rating since the book is outdated in some areas (the book was written in 1997). So!me of his examples are now outdated and other applications do not exist anymore. The author should really take some time to update the book and it would be worth 4 stars instead. But apart from this the book is an useful clear introduction to many people who have no experience with e-commerce and the Internet.	2001-02-10

Drucker is known as the &quot;management guru's management guru&quot;. The articles in this book explain the reason. Each article is a landmark in the field of management.<br />In the preface Drucker shows why he has become so famous. He shows his strength of recognising trends and how these trends will affect business, people, and society. This preface is followed by a short introduction from the editor.<br />The book consists of two Parts, The Manager's Responsibilities and The Executive's World, with each consisting of 6 Harvard Business Review-articles (out of 32 articles and growing). The book also includes an interesting preface, an introduction by Harvard Business Review-editor Nan Stone, and an interview with Peter Drucker.<br />In Part I - The Manager's Responsibilities,  the articles discuss the managerial responsibilities of the manager, although Drucker prefers the term &quot;executive&quot;. The articles discuss general management such as the decision-making process, effective management, strategic management, and innovation.<br />Part II - The Executive's World, Drucker discusses the history of management, the transformation from the traditional command-and-control model to knowledge-based organizations, information technology, and non-profit management.<br />The book concludes with an interview with Peter Drucker, which is based on his 1995-book 'Post-Capitalist Society'.<br />The book deserves the five-star rating since each article is fantastic. Perhaps some of them overlap, but it is amazing that some of the articles written in the 1960s are still very valid today. Drucker's writing style is simple US-English.	2001-02-06

Porter is a Harvard Business School professor and a leading authority on competition. This book consists of three parts - Competition and Strategy: Core Concepts, The Competitiveness of Locations, and Competitive Solutions to Societal Problems - and each of these parts consists of 4-to-5 Harvard Business Review articles which were published between 1979 and 1998. &quot;The study of competition, in its full richness, has preoccupied me for two decades.&quot;<br />In Part I, the five HBR articles outline Porter's strategic concepts. &quot;I have sought to capture the complexity of what actually happens in companies and industries in a way that both advances theory and brings theory to life for practitioners. My goal has been to develop both rigorous and useful frameworks for understanding competition that effectively bridge the gap between theory and practice.&quot; In the 1979-article 'How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy', Porter introduces the monumental five competitive forces (from existing competitors, new entrants, customers, suppliers, substitution). This article has had an extensive impact on the field of strategy and is still a starting point for strategic management at any MBA-course. 'What is Strategy?' was published in 1996 and is, in my opinion, a reply to all the critics of his frameworks and models. The 1985-article 'How Information Gives You Competitive Advantage', Porter and co-author Victor Millar write how information technology influences competition. The current impact of Internet and e-commerce provide excellent examples for this article. In the 1993-article 'End-Game Strategies for Declining Industries', Porter lines up with Kathryn Rudie Harrigan to discuss the last stage/final phase of a industry. This articles is largely based on Harrigan's 1980 book 'Strategies for Declining Businesses' and is a chapter in Porter's 1980-book 'Competitive Strategy'. Part I is finalised with the magnificent 'From Competitive Advantage to CorporateStrategy'. This article is truly a classic and discusses the radical rethinking of corporate strategy. &quot;Corporate strategy is what makes the corporate whole add up to more than the sum of its business parts.&quot; This article is the basis of his book 'Competitive Advantage'.<br />In Part II, Porter kicks off with 'The Competitive Advantage of Nartions', which is also one of the titles of his books. In this 1990-article Porter argues that in a world of increasingly global competition, nations have become more, not less, important. In 'Clusters and Competition' (1998), Porter expands on the theme and discusses the new economics of competition - clusters. &quot;A Cluster is a geographically proximate group of interconnected companies and associated institutions in particular fields, linked by commonalities and complementarities.&quot; Examples are the Italian fashion industry, the California Wine cluster, Silicon Valley's venture capital industry, and Massachusetts IT industry. In the next article, 'How Global Companies Win Out' (1992), Porter, Thomas Hout and Eileen Rudden discuss what a global industry is and how global companies can win out. In the next article, 'Competing Across Locations' (1995), returns on this subject and provides additional insights on global strategy, including a general framework.<br />Part III includes the latest works of Porter. Porter discusses environmental regulation and competition ('Green and Competitive', 1995), with a great case study of the Dutch flower industry, and the impact of these regulations on competition and industries. In the next article ('The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City', 1995), Porter introduces the economic distress of America's inner cities, whereby &quot;the real need - and the real opportunity - is to create wealth&quot; . In the 1990s, Porter also turned more towards government institutions. He discusses the American health care ('Making Competition in Health Care Work', 1994) and, the accordingto Porter, America's failing capital investment system ('Capital Disadvantage', 1992).<br />The advantage of this book is that it provides the a quick insight into the ideas and essential points of Porter's books 'Competitive Strategy', 'Competitive Advantage', and 'Competitive Advantage of Nations'. Part I and Part II are now essentials in the field of strategy and competition with fantastic frameworks and models. Part III are Porter's latest articles and discuss the connection between social issues and competition. A great book that is good to read (simple US-English).	2000-12-31
US	49458047	R3JB4BL9LW260T	0070534489	341340820	The McKinsey Way	Books	4	24	29	N	N	Short, clear introduction into management consultancy	McKinsey & Company is a world-famous strategic consulting company, also known as \\"The Firm\\". Ethan Rasiel worked at McKinsey & Co. for several years and provides a quick, clear introduction into management consulting firm's problem solving methods. \\"I wrote this book with the goal of communicating new and useful skills to everyone who wants to be more efficient and effective in business. ... In addition, this book will give any executive woho works with management consultants, whether McKinsey or elsewhere, some insight into how these strange beings think.\\"    The book is split up into five parts. In Part I, Ethan Rasiel explains the McKinsey-way of thinking about business problems. The author explains that the solution of the problem needs to be fact-based (facts are friendly), rigidly structured (MECE = mutually exclusive), and hypothesis-driven (solve the problem at the first meeting - the initial hypothesis). In addition, the author explains how McKinsey-ites approach business problems and apply the McKinsey problem-solving process to maximum effect. There is also a short introduction into a number of rules which McKinsey-consultants use for problem-solving purposes: the 80/20-rule, find the key drivers, the elevator test - sell in 30 seconds, make a chart every day, look at the big picture, say \\"I don't know\\", and don't accept \\"I have no idea\\".    In Part II, the author introduces the McKinsey-way of working to solve business problems. The author explains the selling process at McKinsey (the Firm does not sell, it markets), how to structure an engagement, and assembling of a team. Then the author comes to the most important part of the book, doing research, conducting interviews (the author insists on reading Chapter 8 - Conducting Interviews - \\"If you read no other chapter of the book from start to finish, read this one.\\"), and brainstorming.    In Part III, the author, and the McKinsey-way of selling solutions. This part discusses the way McKinsey makes presentations, which is one of the strongest parts of McKinsey according to the author, displays data with charts (read Gene Zelazny (1985), 'Say it with Charts'), and the way to work with clients.    In Part IV, Rasiel gives some lessons how \\"McKinsey-ites\\" have learned for coping with the stresses of life at the Firm, and in Part V, the author recounts the lessons he learned at McKinsey and shares memories of various ex-McKinsey-ites. Both Part IV and V are 'a waste of paper' in comparison to the first three parts, but gives a little insight into what goes on behind the scenes at McKinsey & Co.    Yes, I can understand that some readers are disappointed by this book as it gives just an introduction into management consultancy (and McKinsey & Co). The author introduces the various problem-solving methods and tools, but does not discuss them in great detail. The author has responded to these criticisms by publishing The McKinsey Mind in 2002, which addresses this issue somewhat. However, for more details on the problem-solving methods and tools you will still have to read some other literature. I recommend you purchase The McKinsey Way if you want an introduction into management consultancy, and The McKinsey Mind if you want an introduction into problem-solving methods and tools.	2000-12-30

This original edition of this book was written while he was professor at the London Business School. Although this book is not simple to read and is very comprehensive, it is an excellent introduction to understanding organisations (yes, just like the title).<br />The book consists of three parts. Part I introduces a set of models/frameworks, for better understanding of people and organisations. Handy selected six themes common to organisations - motivation, roles and interactions, leadership, power and influence, workings of groups, and cultures of organisations. Each of these themes receives an excellent, extremely in-depth literature review, which all have been updated in this 4th edition to include the latest literature and trends. Handy looks at each of these themes from various angles and does not really push the reader into any dominant one; &quot;This book is eclectic. ... It is wise to be eclectic, to pick from each anything that helps, to compile the sort of personal anthology which is what book aims to be.&quot; In addition, Handy uses a large number of quotes from other academics to explain his comments.<br />In Part II, Handy looks at each of the themes introduced in Part I and their impact on organisations. This part is a lot less academic and Handy tries to apply the models/framework introduced in Part I into practice. &quot;One bookcase for the theorectical models, another for the tips and hints on current practice. The discussion in this part is not intended to be a review of best current practice but rather an interpretation, often a provocative one, of the implications of some of the theories that we say we all subscribe to.&quot; Handy applies it to people of organisations and their development, the work of the organisation - and its design, politics and change, being a manager, and the future of organisations.<br />In Part III, Handy provides a brief overview of the relevant field of theory, makes suggestions on useful sources and gives references to the major studies mentioned in the text. &quot;Part Three is for those who wonder about the sources of my ideas, concepts, and theories, or for those who wish to pursue any topic in greater depth.&quot; Handy does this on a chapter-by-chapter basis, which is very useful for any MBA-student or researcher.<br />This book is a comprehensive piece of work into organisations. It certainly helps you understand organisations better, but do not take this book too lightly as it is not for the fainthearted. It is so extremely comprehensive that I do not see anybody read this book in one go. On the other hand, I must stress that the literature reviewed and covered is spectacular and done fantastically. Handy's ability to bring this into perspective with practice is also very strong. A MUST for MBA-students and all other people interested in organisational studies.	2000-12-30
US	49458047	R2CFZH1BSDJZBL	0684841487	896720440	Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors	Books	5	120	126	N	N	Starting point for business strategy	Michael Porter is a Harvard Business School professor and a leading authority on competition and strategy. This book is a landmark in the field of strategy/strategic management, which later has become known as the positioning school. The book provides a great framework.    The book consists of three parts - General Analytical Techniques, Generic Industry Environments, and Strategic Decisions. In addition, the two appendices - Portfolio Techniques in Competitor Analysis, and How to Conduct an Industry Analysis - should also be mentioned as they are very useful.    In Part I, Porter discussess the structural analysis of industries (with the world-famous five forces), the three generic competitive strategies (overall cost leadership, focus, and differentiation), an excellent framework for competitor analysis, competitive moves, strategy toward buyers and suppliers, structural analysis within industries (strategic groups, strategic mapping, mobility barriers), and industry evolution (life cycle, evolutionary processes).    In Part II, Porter discusses competitive strategy within various generic industry environments, such as fragmented industries (with no real market leader), emerging industries (e-commerce and Internet are excellent examples, although not mentioned in this book as it was written in 1980), mature industries, declining industries, and global industries.    In Part III, Porter discusses strategic decisions which businesses/firms can take, such as vertical integration (forward, backward, partnerships), capacity expansion, and entry into new industries/businesses.    Even after 20 years, most of this book still stands strong, although some people will argue this. Michael Porter has responded to his critics in the 1996-Harvard Business Review article 'What is Strategy?' which is available as e-book (pdf-file) at Amazon.com. It is still a MUST for MBA-students and all other people interested in strategy/strategic management. The book is simple to read with plenty of examples and thus does not become a struggle.	2000-12-30

It offers conceptual and practical tools for analysing alliances, whereby the authors use a several examples of successful and unsuccessful partnerships.<br />The authors describe the purposes of alliances (co-option, cospecialisation, learning and internalisation), compare modern alliances with traditional joint-ventures, value creation in partnerships, and the management (of a web) of alliances.<br />This book provides a good, solid framework for management of partnerships, which is supported by numerous, clear examples.	2000-12-28

This book builds on his initial 1980-book 'Competitive Strategy', which focuses on the industries surrounding businesses (summary of 'Competitive Strategy' is Chapter 1!). In this book, 'Competitive Advantage', Porter focuses on the business itself. The book is based on the activity-based theory of the firm. Activities are what generate cost and create value for buyers/customers, and are the basic units for competitive advantage.    'Competitive Advantage' consists of four parts - Principles of Competitive Advantage, Competitive Scope within an Industry, Corporate Strategy and Competitive Advantage, and Implications for Offensive and Defensive Competitive Strategy. Part I introduces the concept of the value, which is a general framework for thinking about the activities involved in any business and assessing their relative costs and role in differentiation. Then Porter explains the impact of the value chain on cost advantage, differentiation, technology and competitors. Part II discusses industry segmentation and substitution. Part III explains the interrelationships among business units and their impact on horizontal strategy, achievement of interrelationships, and complementary products. Part IV discusses industry scenarios under uncertainty, defensive strategy, and attacks on industry leaders.    Although some parts of the book are somewhat outdated, I would say that many modern management books are based on or around this book. This book provides through the use of the value chain a very useful introduction into activities within businesses. I recommend readers to complement this book with Michael Porter's 1996-Harvard Business Review-article 'What is Strategy?' which is available as a e-book (pdf-file) at Amazon.com. Highly recommended to anyone interested in management and business activities.	2000-12-28
US	49458047	RBWUE8S4IKQH7	0875847161	571072005	Competing for the Future	Books	5	0	2	N	N	Getting to the future first	Great book by Gary Hamel (ex-professor at London Business School) and CK Prahalad (professor at University of Michigan). This book is based on several articles both have written for the Harvard Business Review. Although the goal of the book is &quot;to help managers imagine the future, and having imagined it, create it&quot; the book does not provide a great framework, but discusses the changes from the traditional strategic insights on a chapter-by-chapter way. The message of the book is to start thinking differently about strategy: &quot;Our starting premise is simple: Competition for the future is competition to create and dominate emerging opportunities - to stake out new competitive space.&quot;<br />In Chapter 1 - Getting Off the Treadmill - the authors use an table to lay out the framework for all the chapters to follow. The chapter is monumental (read this chapter and the final chapter if you are really short of time). Chapter 2 - How Competition for the Future is Different - discusses the changes in the competitive challenges and how these changes affect organizations. The authors use a pregnancy (?) as an example to explain these changes: &quot;like competition for the future, pregnancy has three stages - conception, gestation, and labor and delivery. ...The question for managers is to ask themselves at this stage is which stage requires the bulk of time and attention.&quot; Chapter 3 - Learning to Forget - discusses the fact that companies need to cope with altered environments. &quot;But to create the future, a company must be able to forget some of its past.&quot; The goal is to produce a sense of urgency - not a sense of anxiety - and a sense of possibility. &quot;The future must become just as vivid and real as the present and the past.&quot; Chapter 4 - Competing for Industry Foresight - discusses the goal of competition for industry foresight: &quot;to build the best possible assumption base about the future and thereby develop the prescience neededto proactively shape industry evolution.&quot; The authors discuss the need, the development, and the foundations (escape the existing myopia, build curiosity, speculate, search, be contrary, customer-led, empathy for human needs) of foresight.<br />In Chapter 5 - Crafting Strategic Architecture - the authors explain that companies need a blue-print for turning the dream into reality. The strategic architecture is an ongoing process, since the future will one day become &quot;today&quot;. The authors see this process as the map, but discuss the fuel in their next two chapters - Strategy as Stretch and Strategy as Leverage. While strategy as stretch is the engine and fuel for corporate growth and vitality, strategy as leverage ensures that the maximum distance is reached using the least possible amount of fuel. (Strategy as Stretch is in fact my favorite chapter in this book.)<br />In Chapter 8 - Competing to Shape the Future - and Chapter 9 - Building Gateways to the Future - the authors discuss what must be done to turn foresight into reality and outpace competitors on the road to the future. These chapters discuss the risks and possible roads and tools. Chapter 9 provides some more explanation into the now world-famous term &quot;(core) compentencies&quot;. Chapter 10 - Embedding the Core Competence Perspective - builds on this chapter and provides insights into how to build a core competence perspective into a company and their products/services. Once all above tasks are achieved, the organization can move on to the final tasks in managing to Securing the Future (Chapter 11). The main task is to learn faster about future demand than competitors, whereby organizations should use &quot;expenditionary marketing&quot; (prospecting) and global preemption to do this. The final chapter of the book - Thinking Differently - is a conclusion of this excellent book, just as Chapter 1 was an introduction.<br />'Competing for the Future' is probably one of the greatest management books of the 1990s (Business Week's Management Book of 1994), is good to read (simple US-English), and never boring due to its challenging nature. It is perhaps not the greatest introduction into management/business administration, but it should give great inspiration to the more experienced workers/managers.	2000-12-28
