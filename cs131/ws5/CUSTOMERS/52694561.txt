This beautifully laid out trade paperback has a gorgeous and practical design both inside and out.  I recommend you read this book with a highlighter and a pen and be ready to take copious notes in the blank pages thoughtfully provided between chapters.<br /><br />Manners That Sell:  Adding The Polish That Builds Profits should be required reading for high school and college students and for anyone already in the business environment.  Once upon a time, good manners were taught in school and at home, but that time has long since passed.  This book provides the perfect refresher course for those of us who were taught manners but no longer remember the finer points of etiquette.<br /><br />While reading this book I discovered that the author, Lydia Ramsey, covered every conceivable point of etiquette including many that I'd never been taught.  Each of the twelve chapters covers one main topic broken down into digestible bite sized chunks of rules and guidelines to enhance credibility and professionalism.  Topics include first impressions, greetings and introductions, the art of conversation, dressing for business, telephone courtesy, electronic etiquette, correspondence in business, etiquette in the office, gift-giving in business, etiquette out of the office, dining for profit and doing business internationally.<br /><br />The author of this delightful book, Lydia Ramsey, is a business etiquette expert with over thirty years of experience working with non-profits, corporations, colleges and universities. She is a frequently published author who presents workshops, seminars and keynotes on all aspects of business etiquette.<br /><br />I recommend businesses buy this book in bulk and present one to every employee from the frontline up to the top management.  In this ever changing world with so many consumer choices, the bottom line is often affected by the simple courtesies that can and should be afforded to customers.  You need this book if you want your employees to succeed and your business to thrive.loyees to succeed and your business to thrive.	2004-09-21

I so much enjoyed &quot;Sarah&quot; that I read it in twenty-four hours.  The day before I read the &quot;Red Tent&quot;.  If you are searching for a historically accurate portrayal of the story of Sarah and Abraham you won't find it here.  What you will find is an entertaining historical novel focusing on the women in biblical times.  The male author does a really good job (contrary to one reviewers opinion) of writing in a famale voice.  I felt he understood the trials and tribulations of women at that time very well.  This book is about Sarah so to say it would have been better if it had been written about another character is ludicrous.  The ongoing debate between reviewers about the relationship between Sarah and Abraham is also ludicrous given that there is no way to know exactly if they were related or not.  The Bible is filled with historical inaccuracies and exaggerations as it was written by men who had an agenda of their very own to protect.  The point I'm trying to make here is that this is a fictionalized version of the story of Sarah and Abraham.  It is enjoyable, fast paced and gives an overview of life at that time.  If you are looking for biblical truths you won't find it here and no amount of arguing will change that.	2004-06-21

This extraordinary book was recommended to me by a colleague after he visited my new web site, Gift Ideas For Women.  The Male Gift Giving Survival Guide compliments my website perfectly, untangling for men the web of gifts for women.  It deciphers the components of the complex female psyche to its most logical terms.  And no, that's not a misprint...I just used the words \\"female\\" and \\"logical\\" in the same sentence.<br />There is but one universal truth about those of the fairer sex:  \\"Women Love Gifts\\".  So, all women love gifts... a guy doesn't have to be a genius to grasp that concept.  Or does he?  Ask your golf buddy who gave his wife a garden rake for her birthday.  \\"You just had to remind me\\" he mumbles dropping his head.  Make certain that you have lined up another friend for next week's game though...your buddy is going to drop you like a rock.  According to the author, women adore gifts that reflect the love of the giver and his explicit understanding of her desires and tastes.  As a woman, I must salute this author.  His book is the literal lifeboat of women's gift ideas, without which no self-respecting man would ever set sail on the sea of relationships.<br /><br />The author, Tim Connor, is a seasoned and well-traveled professional speaker who has authored 45 books.  He wrote this book based upon the knowledge he gained in his personal mission to discover the keys to female happiness.  The result of his quest is this easy-to-read, spiral bound book that men can refer to routinely.  Not only does Tim's book disclose the keys to a woman's happiness, it is the genuine tool for unlocking it with an ever-so-easy click.<br />The book begins with the quote:<br />\\"A man who knows what women want rules the world.\\"<br />- Nick Marshall<br />This first quote of many accurately reflects the intention of this book.  Continual studies concur that the happiest relationships, right or wrong, are those in which the woman is happy and fulfilled.  There are some common guidelines in the book that apply to every woman regardless of her individual preferences and needs.<br />Important chapters include \\"The 20 Biggest Gift-Giving Mistakes Men Make\\", \\"It's not about the money or the number of gifts, or is it?\\" and two chapters detailing in-depth, women's stories about the worst and best gifts they have ever received.  Many of the best gifts, as pointed out in the book, were not the most expensive or glittery.  They were often romantic gifts that were well thought out, affordable, considerate and timely.<br />Many of the collective complaints about gifts from men to women are that the men often don't remember important dates, don't pay attention to the nuances of a woman's life and don't know what she prefers most or cares for the least.  The Male Gift Giving Survival Guide covers all three bases.  The book features an extensive diary prompting men to record important dates, what makes her happy or feel loved, favorite colors, dress and jewelry sizes, travel destinations, food, restaurants, activities, etc.  Guys can fill out this diary as their relationship with a woman progresses and consult it regularly for help choosing the perfect gift.  Other diary sections are for tracking any gift given to the woman, her reaction and also a gift log so that the same gift is not given again and again.<br />Overall, I found this book to be an amusing and accurate portrayal of the importance of gifts in the life of a woman.  Every male over the age of twelve who reads and follows this book will certainly reflect the female appreciation of his genius in the smile he wears on his face.&lt;(...)lines in the book that apply to every woman regardless of her individual preferences and needs.<br />Important chapters include \\"The 20 Biggest Gift-Giving Mistakes Men Make\\", \\"It's not about the money or the number of gifts, or is it?\\" and two chapters detailing in-depth, women's stories about the worst and best gifts they have ever received.

Talking To The Dead is an excellent history of spiritualism and the Fox family.  Kate and Maggie Fox (and older sister Leah) are mediums who converse with the dead.  This started when they were young girls and progressed to the point where they were famous through the Americas and in Europe.  They were wined and dined by nobility and common folk alike for many years.  Everywhere they went they seemingly spread their powers among many others who met them and therefore they are credited with the creation of the Spiritualism movement (although it had started more quietly during an earlier period).  This book is perfect for those interested in mediums, psychics, psychic phenomena and the rise of Spiritualism.	2004-05-14

The queen of England, Mary, who preceeded the more famous Queen Elizabeth on the throne has all but been forgotten.  The central character to this book, Hannah Verde, is a Jewish girl pretending to be Christian for her own protection.  Hannah has the unpredictable gift of being able to see the future.  She is brought to court to work as a &quot;fool&quot; to the short lived King Edward and stays on, through thick and thin, to work for Queen Mary and her half sister Elizabeth.  I found this story to be less about Hannah and more about Queen Mary who had a disastrous reign because of her fanatical Catholic faith and her poor selection of a husband.  The story also focuses on the manipulative Queen Elizabeth before she was Queen.  Although a bit dry at times I found this book to be a fascinating study of England at a time of extreme religious turmoil and intolerance.  The message of the book, I think, is that more murder and mayhem has been committed in the name of religion than for any other reason and that the only way to peace is religious tolerance.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-03-15

Eyes at the Window is a novel based on the true story of a murder that happened in an Amish community in 1810.  The fact that an infant was brutally murdered makes the story more poignant as does the first person narrative of all those involved over the span of the next fifty years.  The story of the murder and how it affected this community is interesting but even more interesting for me were the details of Amish living in the 1800's.

Aletta Honor is a genuine psychic who has avoided her gift almost her entire life.  Why she avoids her gift is a mystery that is unravelled throughout the story of her present day life as the mother of three with another on the way.  Aletta is like many women in America, and in many other countries, in that she latches onto an attractive, charming man when she is very young and holds on for dear life no matter what the cost.  Aletta makes the mistake of badgering her charming good for nothing boyfriend Jimmy into marrying her and then proceeds to have four children one right after the other.  Aletta is a stay at home mom and she never stops to think that she and Jimmy cannot afford the childen and even though he is a good father - Jimmy never seems to want his children or show that much interest in them.  Once she has Jimmy trapped, Aletta is alarmed to find him staying out after work later and later and coming home drunk.  His drinking soon escalates to all out abuse and neglect of his family which is not suprising considering that he never, like many men, wanted the burden or responsibility of marriage and children.  Aletta is forced to rely in her own instincts and finally grows up and matures and finds a way to use her psychic gifts to support herself and her children.<br /><br />Throughtout the dissolution of her marriage Aletta revisits her childhood, her discovery of her psychic powers and the events that lead up to the death of her father and uncle and her estrangement from her mother.<br /><br />This is a fascinating story of small town life, with some extraordinary characters thrown in for good measure.  I enjoyed reading this book and found myself wishing it didn't have to end.	2004-01-05

If you have been watching Lysa and reading her on-line diary then you will not need this book.  This book is virtually only entries from her on-line diary, which I read long ago, combined with some stories from her first book tour.  The stories about her psychic talents are great but there are few stories about that in the book.  The book really is a self help book where Lysa constantly tries to convince the reader that everyone is great, wonderful, has a good soul, can do whatever they want... I've read this stuff in so many books and when you compare it to real life you know it's not true.  There is good and evil in the world and not everyone is beautiful and wonderful.  Unfortunately, I got bored halfway through the book but forced myself to finish so I can only give the book three stars.	2003-12-29

Rick Warren is the pastor of one of the largest churches in the United States.  Pastor Warren has one focus in every sermon and every event at his church... how much money can you give us?  He is far more concerned about having church members turn over their paychecks to the church (and I'm not kidding about that) to build a multi-million dollar church administration building than he is about living a purpose driven life.  As a former member I can say that the tax avoiding (he doesn't pay taxes even though he is supposed to) Pastor Warren does not live the life he writes about in his book.  He lives in an expensive house, drives very expensive cars and uses each sermon to beg for more money.  Don't waste your time on anything he produces.	2003-10-28

Joe Vitale has written a deceptively simple book that focuses on five steps called &quot;The Million Dollar Formula&quot; that you can use to create the success you deserve in your business and personal life.  This book is not really about &quot;marketing&quot; per se but more about using spiritual techniques for tapping into the wealth available to all of us all.  Joe uses personal stories to illustrate how emotional blocks may be stopping us from creating the life we deserve and gives us the five steps to overcome those blocks to get focused on what you really want from life.  I read this book through quickly once and now I'm reading it again more slowly with a yellow highlighter.  During my first reading of the book I focused on my desire to add a certain type of new client to my practice and within a week that very type of client materialized and signed a long-term contract within days.

I found this book to be best for covering the basics of marketing and promotion on the internet.  However, as is the problem with many internet books, the links and e-mail addresses offered in the book are out of date and don't work.  Despite this problem, the book is very helpful and full of good information.	2001-06-17

The author, Echo Bodine, writes about two of my favorite subjects in this book:  psychics and ghosts.  She covers a great deal of ground in this small book and her writing style is warm and friendly, if a bit immature.  Some readers may be annoyed by the writing style and the fact that Ms. Bodine occasionally repeats herself but overall this is a good read.	2001-06-17

Carol Bowman has done it again.  She's written a book that is so easy to ready and so fascinating you can't put it down.  I finished the book way too fast and will reread it over and over again.  I've believed in reincarnation since I was a very small girl and my extensive reading on the subject has convinced me that most of the people in our lives have reincarnated with us over and over again.  This book helps us realize that death is not the end but the beginning and that our separations from our deceased loved ones are brief... I can't wait for Carol's next book!	2001-05-03

Although I will always remain a fan of her music, I no longer respect Celine and her husband Rene.  Celine portrays herself as a lovesick, immature and all around helpless woman who cannot survive one minute without her ailing, 26 year older husband.  This book really is a homage to her husband more than a book about her career.  I am aghast that Celine's family practically sold her out to Rene when she was barely a teenager and did nothing to stop his seduction of her.  Don't waste your time and money on this book.	2000-12-28

Reading a book by James Van Praagh is like sitting down with your best friend for coffee.  He is down to earth yet knowledgeable in addition to being kind and sympathetic.  &quot;Healing Grief&quot; is an important book  not only for those suffering a recent loss but also for those of us who  have not properly grieved a loss from the past.  As I read the book, I was  immediately taken back to my grief over the loss of a very important  relationship in my life.  I still grieve this loss after five years because  I have not properly dealt with the attending emotions.  Going through  James' checklists and steps for dealing with grief helped a great deal.  I'm better prepared now to deal with loss in the future.  I will read this  book over and over again and purchase more copies for friends and loved  ones when they experience a loss.	2000-05-10

What a lifesaver...buy this book...you won't regret it.	1997-12-30
