US	52186522	RMIQESYOR95R8	0843955597	757817032	Finishing Touches	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Disturbing stuff	This is one disturbingly creepy book! It's about Tom, a young-ish American guy, fresh out of medical school and somewhat unsatisfied with the \\"general practice\\" position hefell into by default when nothing else grabbed him. He decides to drop everything and take a trip to London. There he meets an older guy, a plastic surgeon, who begins to show him the seedier, hidden side of London nightlife.<br /><br />One night the Tom is supposed to meet the old doc for a night out on the town (the two have become quite the club go-ers). When Tom shows up at the old doc's office he's told by a gorgeous woman with flowing black locks named Lina that the doc can't make it and she will entertain him instead. Tom can't believe his good fortune. It gets better. Lina is apparently attracted to Tom and they have wild erotic sex (that isn't detailed all that much, darn). Tom is in lurrrve immediately and Lina, though a little aloof and a tad secretive, seems to feel the same. When Tom is completely under Lina's spell he'll soon do anything (and I do mean anything) to keep her in his life. After a completely disturbing episode involving Tom, Lina and an Asian woman (whose name we never know) Tom fears Lina may be a tad, ah, off her rocker. But he's in lurrve, like I said, and can't seem to stay away from her for any length of time. . . The book tells the story from Tom's point of view and really gets into his head. We watch a normal guy play out his deepest, darkest fantasies and see how these episodes change him. It's very dark and got under my skin.<br /><br />This is stuff that could possibly happen to any normal guy swayed by lust which makes it all the more creepier. Not for the fainter of heart.<br /><br />This edition also includes a novella by the same author that I didn't find nearly as compelling.  The horror of the novella is mostly disgusting rapes and other grossities and was very in-your-face.  It's about a pea-brained man who stumbles into a modern day concentration camp.  He's lured there by a gorgeously sexy woman (when will you men realize you've got to be wary of them!).  They have mad sex and then some very bad things happen.  I didn't enjoy this one on any level but Finishing Touches is worth a read.He's lured there by a gorgeously sexy woman (when will you men realize you've got to be wary of them!).

I rarely say this but in this case I almost wished it were abridged as it went on for what seemed like an eternity.<br /><br />This is historical romance ALA Romeo and Juliet. The couple meet, instantly connect but are forced apart when their identities are revealed.<br /><br />Fast forward to the future. Leah, the former debutante, is now heavily pregnant and apparently destitute having spurned Devon months earlier (cuz of the fued and all). Devon is on the way to visit his dying grandfather when he just so happens to stumble across Leah. Hmmmm, my oh my, what an unexpected coincidence! Leah falls in an attempt to run from Devon and goes into labor (oops, did I forget to mention she was pregnant and ruined?).<br /><br />Devon sticks around and helps her deliver the child that is not his.<br /><br />The past between these two is explained away so quickly my head was spinning. Here's what happened when we weren't looking: Devon and Leah's brother dueled, her brother was permanently disabled as a result (serves him right, if you ask me) and Leah refuses to leave with Devon when he declares his love. Instead, she decides to do what is best for her family and tries to snag the richest man in town who, as her luck would have it, happens to be a raving lunatic. Then she thinks for a minute and realizes she doesn't want to be tied to a loon and runs off with a handsome rake who impregnates her and conveniently dies. She's on her own now, and even has calluses, when Devon comes upon her. Why this chick who supposedly wants to save her family from poverty so badly that she runs off the love of her life decides to do these nitwitted things is completely beyond my comprehension. This glossed over section really marred my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />Fortunately, Devon is a charming, stand-up guy and was the only reason I continued to read on.<br /><br />Still as it went on and on (kind of like this review) I found it tedious, dull and dowright boring. This (and the zillion others just like it) is the reason I've bought only a small handful of romances the past few years . . .  To sum it up I didn't feel any emotional attachment to the story at all and didn't particularly like any of the choices made by the heroine and would not re-read it.nd dowright boring.

This review is for the ABRIDGED recording.<br /><br />The story moved along at a nice clip and the imagery was vivid enough but it was pretty much all action and not enough character interaction for me (maybe it was edited out).

US	52186522	R2VFJD2R42MAJA	0515138819	301916690	Sunshine	Books	3	2	7	N	Y	Not nearly as good as I was expecting	It took me months to finish this book!  I kept picking it up and putting it down for other books that interested me.  The beginning reminded me a lot of Nancy Baker's Kiss of the Vampire where a young woman is abducted and jailed with a vampire. This time it's a young woman who makes her living cooking cinnamon rolls (yum, I think I could live with that job) in a family run coffee shop. She has a close group of friends and a likable boyfriend and seems very content with the way her life is going until she's abducted by vampires and chained up with only a hungry, dying vampire for a companion. The writing is different from McKinley's usually lyrical style (Deerskin, Beauty). The tone is more modern both in slang and subject matter and I enjoyed it very much in the beginning despite stumbling over some of the narrative.<br /><br />As the story progresses, and our heroine \\"Sunshine\\" has plenty of time to reflect on her past, we learn she possesses some inherited magical power that increases when she's in full sunlight. In this world vampires and \\"Other\\" creatures are commonplace. Though the beginning grabbed me I'm sorry to say I can't say the same about the rest of the book. Midway through it became a real struggle to finish and I ended up doing some major skimming to get to the end and ended up feeling \\"eh\\" about the whole thing.  I didn't find it witty or all that interesting in the end.	2005-08-18

A Parcel of Patterns was about the bubonic plague and was heart-rending. This book suffers in comparison but was still a good read. The heroine grows up during the course of the story but, for some reason, I never felt her losses as painfully as I should have. Still, it kept me entertained and anxious to keep reading.	2005-08-18

This book states the reasons people collect clutter and was a real eye opener for me!<br /><br />This was a terrific motivator for me and was more helpful than I anticipated. I now have a clean closet near my entryway (starting there because it's most important) and found things that had been buried in there for over 10 years!

This book is frightening but helps explain why many of us feel so damned cruddy most of the time. There are so many toxins and chemicals and other assorted grossities in our food supply it's a wonder many of us are still breathing.<br /><br />Parts of the book are a bit meandering and repetitive but I am very glad I took the time to get through it.	2005-08-18

The main character is so odd and quirky and his little obsessions and thoughts about the women around him had me smiling all the way home (and that's a rarity as my drive is a nightmare!).<br /><br />Daniel, the narrator, has these odd little neurosis. He can't walk off a curb like most people (at least without a whole lot of anxiety), he has his house set up so that the bulb wattage equals a certain number at all times (this causes a major glitch when he attempts to have a little liaison with a lady who wants the lights dimmed) and he suffers a few other oddities that make his life quite difficult but also quite funny to those reading his tale. When he makes an attempt at running and soon after suffers the consequences it's hard not to laugh at his folly.<br /><br />This book was so very sweet and a pure pleasure to read.

I was very much looking forward to this one because Undead & Unwed hit all of the right notes for me.  Unfortunately, for the most part, I was seriously disappointed. Nothing much at all seemed to be happening besides lots of quips being thrown about.  Sadly, they lacked the bite and fun of the 1st book or maybe I'm just a complete crab. Also, the sexual tension, which was so much a part of book #1, seems to be nearly non-existent here :(<br /><br />Eventually things picked up and this was an amusing enough read but it did not live up to the promise and originality of Undead & Unwed. Still, I like Davidson's sass and will read the next in the series.	2005-08-18

I didn't particularly like either main character -- Elena, the only female werewolf in existance as we're told time and again (and, why again is that?) or Clay, the super alpha wolf with the Chippendales looks -- but I still found the story compelling.<br /><br />Elena despises Clay (but loves him too) and only wants to live a normal \\"human\\" existence. Clay, born and raised a werewolf, can't figure her out. He wants her, she wants him, so what's the problem-o? Well, for starters, Elena LIVES with another man whom she claims to love yet diddles with Clay when she's in his turf. Elena is so wishy-washy about this it continually annoyed me throughtout the reading of the book.<br /><br />Character flaws aside, I did enjoy this book. As it moved along I understood Elena's quandary a bit better (though she still annoyed the h*ll out of me at times) and Clay's ruthlessness and possessiveness was nicely balanced by the whole \\"mating forever\\" thingy that happens between wolves.  I still feel bad for the poor human sap Elena was stringing along but whatever . . .<br /><br />The plot zipped along and I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />I'd read more books about these wolves as I think they're much more engaging than the \\"Magic\\" books written by the same author.	2005-08-18

I skimmed through the first few pages & nearly tossed it aside because I found the prose overwrought and extremely melodramatic. It reminded me of the sort of thing someone who has never read a romance might write thinking this is the way it's done. Purple proze, fluttering hands, and swooning galore. Blech, I didn't think I'd be able to stomach it if it continued on that way.  But then something odd happened. . .<br /><br />I zipped through 3/4's of it without taking a break, getting bored, or skimming. I haven't done that in YEARS. Something about the story fascinated me. It wasn't frightening or overly gory but was filled with a nice sense of impending dread, a creeping ugliness and an increasingly jaded, frustrated and angry heroine. Ellen's ideal marriage soon turns out to be a huge disaster once she realizes he's a monster, sexual deviant and possible murderer. She develops a close bond with her beautiful servant Sukeena who is strong, unafraid and possess powerful knowledge. Before long Ellen longs more for the touch of her friend Sukeena than the monstrous hands of her once perfect husband. Her feelings, her anger and her thoughts of revenge were all realistically portrayed. Interesting stuff and I'm glad I continued reading past the insipid beginning.<br /><br />Still, in the end, I was a bit disapointed. Big chunks of the so-called diary were removed by Dr. Reardon to spare us gentle reader's the shocking sexual revelations within. Dr. Reardon directs said nosy reader's to a website in order to read these \\"deleted\\" passages.

Her mother, the Queen, has surprisingly agreed to the alliance between Brianna and the two (yeah, you read that right) wizards Lasan & Drago (they're twins and in this world two parts of a whole and inseparable). Brianna, though attracted to the twins, is scared out of her silly little mind because her evil, maniacally cackling nurse tells her frightening tales of the twins. Brianna, being a naive and not-so-bright pretty young thing, believes every word though everything she's seen and experienced of the twins tells her differently.

Now she's forced to live with people who resent her and treat her to cruelty piled upon cruelty. To add to the angst, she's also all mixed up inside sexually about the two boys' in her life. Jimmy was raised as her brother and Philip (her boyfriend with the groping paws) who she recently discovers *is* her brother. Ehhh, what a dilemma!<br /><br />I have to admit that I was absolutely riveted to this story while reading despite all of its over-the-top drama and other assorted flaws.

The stories, though, were a bit of a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />The Boogeyman:  This one reminded me, in the very best possible way, of a \\"Tales From the Crypt\\" episode about childhood fears and monsters in the closet.<br /><br />I Know What You Need:  Sorta grungy boy meets pretty girl, gives her everything she desires, then she discovers his dark, not-very-well-hidden secrets and she freaks. Stupid girl, you know you'll never find a guy like that again!  I enjoyed this one but was slightly annoyed by the rather rushed ending.<br /><br />Strawberry Spring:  A killer stalks a college campus with a surprise ending.  This was a creepy, atmospheric tale.<br /><br />Gray Matter:  This one's about many a man's worst nightmare.  That tall cool one you've just downed had some fuzzy gray stuff inside that turns you into an icky flesh eating-gray-creature!<br /><br />The Woman in the Room:  Realistic horror about slowly watching someone you love suffer as she awaits death. Shall you let the suffering continue or put an end to the pain, knowing full well you can? This was too realistically depressing for me.<br /><br />Battleground:  This story is about a man and toy soldiers.  It didn't do it for me.  I fast forwarded through this as it gave me an urge to snore. Not so good when one is driving!<br /><br />Graveyard Shift:  Everyman has a crappy, thankless job doing the midnight shift in creepy old mill and is tormented by an evil BossMan.  The job takes a turn for the worse with the discovery of monster rats, monster bats and a big ol' supersized momma rat. Bet you can't guess what happens to the big bad BossMan? Overall a cliched rat story but very well read by Glover who does rat-love oh-so-wonderfully.<br /><br />The Man Who Loved Flowers:  A young man, apparently wildly in love, collects flowers for his sweetie causing women to swoon with jealousy and non-flower bearing men to become very annoyed. Young man-in-love turns out to have an ugly surprise for his latest sweetie . . .  Loved this one!<br /><br />The Last Rung on The Ladder:  Another could've-been-true story filled with suspense. A man is haunted by memories of his younger sister, her loyalty and complete and utter trust. The story focuses on the man when he was a boy and on a pivotal moment in his life that he's reflecting on now that he's filled with oodles of regret.<br /><br />Night Surf:  A tale about a group of college/high school students told from the point of view of a boy who is very cruel to his girlfriend. Girlfriend: \\"Do you love me?\\" Meanie boyfriend: well he can't spare the venom to answer \\"no\\". As she trails after him, looking for any scrap of love he'll never dole out, he's thinking about how revolting her fat bum looks. Turns out they are only a small handful of survivors of King's nasty flu \\"Captain Tripps\\" (ALA \\"The Stand\\") and they've banded together to sacrifice a flu victim by burning him alive. Eww[...] Bitter characters clinging to scraps of life as they await death. This is good stuff.<br /><br />Jerusalem's Lot:  Maybe it was my mood but this story was what I'd consider \\"work\\" to finish. My mind easily drifted away, occasionally caught by an interesting bit of creepy narrative before flickering away to ponder all of my own inner thoughts or to swear at some impatient jack*ss who just cut me off. It's told in flashbacks and recounts a man's discovery of his dark family tree, an abandoned village and a really disturbing church.<br /><br />Lawnmower Man:  This was just as weird and chilling as the first time I read it many moons ago.  It tells a story of a devious new lawn service.  Remember the movie based on this story, anyone?  The story is much shorter as it should be.<br /><br />Quitters, Inc.:  I hear attempting to quit smoking is one of the most difficult things imaginable. As someone who sucks in second hand smoke all day at work I wish there were something along the lines of a \\"Quitters, Inc.\\" I think the problem would be nipped pretty quickly and those with weak willpower, well, they'd be taken care of . . .<br /><br />The Ledge:  This dark edged tale tells the story of a tennis pro who was hitting the sheets with a married woman.  The wrong married woman, as it turns out.  She's married to a mafia-type who doesn't take kindly to sharing his wife. Somehow or other Mafia-guy convinces not-too-bright-tennis-guy to go out on his ledge which is several stories high and plays all sorts of dastardly tricks in an attempt to get him to fall off the ledge. This is one that'll either have you biting your fingernails in anticipation of a big face plant on cement or you'll be wanting your half hour back.<br /><br />Sometimes They Come Back:  This one is about a school teacher plagued by ghosts from his past.

US	52186522	R1FGDHKZP86NPY	0792726243	204129885	True to Form	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Enjoyable little slice of life tale	I read this as an unabridged audiobook and although the narrator does a good job of portraying a frustrated young girl on the verge of womanhood she talks at such a leisurely pace and inserts so many pauses between words that this short book seemed to take an . . .  eternity . . .  to . . . finish..<br /><br />The book is set in the late 1950's but that doesn't matter overmuch as the story could just as well take place today and the setting isn't a huge part of the telling.  Katie is a lonely 13 year old living with her stern father and his new wife (who isn't, thankfully, an evil witchy stereotype).  They recently moved to a new town and Katie is having a tough time making new friends.  She wants to hang with the cool kids but only terminally uncool Cynthia has been friendly.<br /><br />Katie is looking forward to spending her summer ogling sexy young lifeguards at the beach but those dreams come to a crashing halt when her father insists she spend her summer assisting a bedridden neighbor and babysitting some neighborhood brats. Katie, the dutiful daughter, does as he demands but slyly enters a \\"free vacation\\" contest which she wins.  She uses it to visit the home town she misses so much and visit an old friend (a \\"cool\\" kid) for a few days. The trip turns out to be a bust as Katie realizes cool kids can also be very shallow and downright boring. The story continues as the days of summer pass and Katie grows up, makes mistakes and experiences all of the angst as only a 13 year old can.  After reading this I've realized I wouldn't want to be 13 again even for all the chocolate in the land.<br /><br />Katie is an easy to like character that makes some very wise observations about life and how things you thought were forever can all change so quickly.  I enjoyed this little glimpse into her life despite the slooooow reading by the narrator.	2005-04-18
US	52186522	RKXCO6L0OM349	0373770103	962939597	Night's Edge	Books	4	47	49	N	N	2 out of 3 ain't bad	This anthology fares better than most in that two of the three stories are worth reading.  If I were able to do it all over again I'd skip the Hambly story but since I can't turn back time I've just got to suck it up.<br /><br />Maggie Shayne used to be my favorite paranormal romance author way back when she was writing for Silhouette Shadows (very sadly defunct) but she lost me when she started writing books with Witchy heroines who annoyed the heck out of me.  This time around she tackles a haunted house tale with a hot dog swilling heroine who works as a reporter and has a huge chip on her shoulder.  Kiley spends her life debunking the local psychics, all of whom turn out to be crackpots swindling the public.  All but Jack McCain, who just happens to be a hunky hunk,  that is.  Jack and Kiley have a love/hate relationship as he knows she's out to get him next.  When Kiley suspects her new home may be haunted who do you think she runs to?  None other than the man whose face she deliberately blew smoke in a few days earlier.  Jack, being a man, succumbs to her charms (she's gorgeous, wouldn't you know it?) and helps her with her troubles despite his misgivings.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story for the most part.  I was irritated by the heroine many times but eventually she grew on me and loosened up on her stringent beliefs a bit. The haunted house aspects were just creepy enough to hold my attention and have me anxiously turning the pages but the romance was a bit of a flop for me. The pair went from complete dislike, to overwhelming lust, to deep forever love in a blink. I can't see them shacking up together for any longer than a month before boredom sets in, tempers begin to flare and Kylie storms out in a huff.  Hmmm, this all sounds mighty negative but, truly, I did enjoy the story and was never bored enough to toss it aside.<br /><br />The Barbara Hambly story \\"Someone Else's Shadow\\" was more problematic when it came to holding my attention.  There was too much navel gazing going on and it took forever to get moving.  The heroine, Maddie, had too much internal dialogue for my liking and over analyzed everything and everyone near to her.  It was also excruciatingly gloomy.<br /><br />One night Maddie goes out in search of her young roomie, Tessa, who spends long nights alone practicing ballet in a creepy studio. While searching for Tessa a smelly man lurking in the shadows whispers something along the lines of \\"little sl*ts are all alike\\" before disappearing. Maddie is justifiably creeped out and when Tessa introduces her to Phil, a nice enough guy who is temporarily homeless and living at the studio, she fears he was the one whispering those not-so-sweet-nothings in her ear. But she's confused because Phil isn't stinky and the erotic dreams she has about Phil after the fact have her hoping he isn't the potty-mouthed, foul-smelling psychopath hanging out in the shadows.  Naturally, s he goes over and over (and over) this in her head, does a tarot reading filled with danger signs that add fuel to the fire, then worries about her roomie, her past, her mother and well you can see the pattern here.<br /><br />The pace eventually picks up but for me it was too little of a pay-off that came far too late.  The beginning was too unfocused and meandering and in the end it was only an okay ghost story and a so/so romance.<br /><br />The Charlaine Harris story \\"Dancers In The Dark\\" was the best of the bunch.  Rue is a dancer haunted by a tragic past that is only revealed in bits and pieces. She signs on with a company of dubious origins called \\"Blue Moon\\" where she is paired up with a sexily accented, very secretive, centuries old vampire named Sean. The pair hit it off as only two kindred and very damaged souls can but trouble surfaces when a nut from Rue's past comes back to haunt her. This story was tender and suspenseful and never made me think \\"awww, stop feeling sorry for yourselves and get over it already\\" as so many angsty vampire tales have a tendency to do.

Tape 1 starts out with an unending list of author thank you's and a never-ending list of family trees involved in the story.  To say this was off-putting and a tad overwhelming is a major understatement for forgetful me.  I was hoping the actual book (when the narrator finally got around to reading it, that is) wouldn't be quite so, well, quite so longwinded. (only I can be longwinded, you see).<br />Once the story got a move-on I found myself enjoying it immensely -- in the beginning.<br /><br />The heroine Elizabeth, a 29 year old spinster, wants nothing more than her independence and the freedom to teach young children. With this in mind, she leaves behind stuffy society life with all of its rules and prejudices against women and sets out to the wilderness that is known as \\"Paradise\\" to join her father and brother. What she doesn't know is that her father, facing financial ruin, has arranged to marry her off to the local doctor with the promise of bequeathing half of his large land holdings to her. She's livid and attracted to a man most unsuitable . . .<br /><br />Nathaniel, who was raised by Native Americans, is just as attracted to Elizabeth. Her backbone, tart tongue and independence intrigue him as much as her looks but he knows their attraction can only lead to pain. When Elizabeth discovers dear old daddy's devious plan she's already fallen deeply in love with Nathaniel.  Not one to sit back and take her lumps she decides to concoct a little deception of her own which will enable Nathaniel to have the land he so longs to make his own. But things don't work out quite as planned when there's a doctor with a big old bone to pick who is determined to have the land no matter the cost . . .<br /><br />This is a fictional story filled with historical information and action-adventure along the lines of Diana Gabaldon (minus the paranormal bits). It's very, very loooong but held my attention for the first half or so.  After that, my mind began to drift back to the piles of laundry I had waiting for me at home.  For reasons I can't seem to pinpoint, the book just didn't resonate with me the way I expected it to.  Maybe it was all of those glowing reviews I made the mistake of reading ahead of time? I'm unsure.  Either way, I didn't find the last half exceptionally gripping and, more problematic perhaps, I wasn't overly moved by the love story which was the heart of the book.  Maybe I'm just cold hearted?  Who knows.  All I know for certain is that if I were reading this in book form I would have put it down at the halfway mark and never picked it up again . . .that, my mind began to drift back to the piles of laundry I had waiting for me at home.

The attraction?  Well, even one of my crappiest, exhaustion-filled day pales in comparison to living through the plague.  Or maybe it's those gore filled plague sores that call to me (but I'd never truly admit that).<br /><br />This book is a bit different than the few that I've read about the plague of the 1600's in that it isn't scholarly, dry or written from the point of view of adults.  This fictional tale is told by a young lady named Mal who describes her world with beauty and sensitivity.  Initially, the writing style was a bit of a chore and a little difficult to get into.  But stick with it, the journey is well worth the work.  Once I adjusted myself to the rhythm of the writer and the different language choices (than I'm used to) I fell completely into Mall's world of hard work and young love amidst the threat of unbelievable horror when the Bubonic Plague arrives.<br /><br />I'm a hard-hearted reader, having read far more than my share of overly sentimental stuff, but this book brought me to tears too many times to count from the sheer strength of this young girl.  It makes me all teary just to think about these people.  This is a book that should be required reading in schools (if it isn't already).	2005-03-24
US	52186522	R24OIILS44OOYH	0684823691	18666983	Sightings	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Much better than I anticipated	The haunting section of this book truly creeped me out. Particularly the section about \\"Voices of the Dead\\". For some reason it brought to memory snippets from the ultra-spooky \\"Session 9\\" film (based on a true story as well). \\"The Ghosts of Gettysburg\\" made me sad rather than scared. To think of all of those young men lost forever really struck a nerve. \\"The Blue Lady\\" was a fascinating tale of co-existing between human and ghost/spirit that I found pretty nifty. Most of the tellings had to do with terrified humans being haunted by malevolent spirits that sometimes physically hurt them so the \\"blue lady\\" was a nice change of pace here. I saw the movie based on the story of \\"The Entity\\" so I knew what it was about going in and didn't learn anything all that new here though it did scare the life out of me when I was a young girl. I was hoping the \\"Sightings\\" crew would've dug up some fascinating proof or adding something new to the story but all in all this one seemed the least effective of the bunch. \\"Ghost Writer\\" was flat out creepy as I've seen (often) a figure out of the corner of my eye both at home and when alone at work. I chalk it up to an over-active imagination and a wee bit of paranoia but now I have to wonder . . . I wish I had caught this show when it was on the air.  My only complaint are the pictures documenting the proof of each story are stuck smack in the center of the book so I have to keep flipping back and forth when a picture is referenced. It's a bit of pain but then again maybe I'm just lazy.<br /><br />I could take or leave the UFO abduction stories as they all seem to be more of the same type of story I've read time and again (people see odd lights, black out, are missing huge chunks of time,etc.) None have turned me into a believer just yet . . .<br /><br />Many of \\"The Unexplained\\" stories were emotionally moving.  Especially \\"A Child's Premonition\\" and particularly \\"School Room Angels\\" which was a new case to me. It's sad and tragic that the children in Beslam didn't have the same experience.<br /><br />I recommend to this to anyone with an open mind and curiousity about the unknown.the children in Beslam didn't have the same experience.<br /><br />I recommend to this to anyone with an open mind and curiousity about the unknown.	2005-03-13

The boy \\"Nicky Jack\\" is never found but his pajama bottoms are ominiously located. The book then fast forwards to the present day when the child, now a grown man, heads back to town to learn about his mysterious past.<br /><br />Mark is now a successful veterinarian and has always had the very best that money can buy but when his adoptive parents die he finds evidence that maybe his life wasn't meant to be lead tending to pampered pooches in California. When he arrives in Oklahoma his appearance opens a great big moldery bag of worms.<br /><br />Mark or \\"Nicky Jack\\" as he's known in Oklahoma is alright as characters go and the cast full of small time folks are \\"alright\\" as well. Unfortunately, it's all just \\"alright\\" or average. There isn't a lot of spark to hold this little mystery tale together and I have a feeling that if I were reading this as a regular book it would've been far too easy to put down. It needed more life, more humor, more something . . .	2005-03-01

Enough so that I'm going to track down the others.<br /><br />Vane and Bride, were both likable characters.  I found Vane a very romantic, sexy and brooding guy (but not so much it became annoying) but the nasty ex-boyfriend, who conveniently kept popping up to make Bride feel like crap, got old very quickly. He's immature and obnoxious and has left Bride with a very bad self image. I get it. My only regret is that the author took far too long to get past it and move on with things!<br /><br />Overall the book is fast paced and the main characters likable but somewhere past the midway point when Vane and Bride meet up with others in the Katagaria & Arcadia tribes my head began to spin.  Utter confusion overcame me it was here that I wished I'd read the previous books. Lots of names and issues and past wars/hurts/deaths talked about and I had a very difficult time making sense of it all. When the story switched back to the romance between Vane & Bride the pages flew but when the pack politics kicked back in I was mighty confused. I'm going to collect these and read them in order because the story is quite interesting despite my confusion at past events!	2005-03-01

As expected, the stories all written for children, were all peopled with oddball characters and fantastical plots.  \\"Wolves In The Walls\\" begins when a young girl begins to hear odd sounds emanating from within the walls.  She's eventually told by per parents the sounds are the wolves that live in the walls and if they get out \\"it's all over!\\".  They don't seem too worried about it however as they carry on with their distracted lives (distracted and otherwise occupied parents seems to be an ongoing theme with Gaiman).  This is a wonderfully eerie little tale and it's read perfect by Gaiman (as they all are).  \\"Cinnamon\\" is the story of a young princess who will not speak.  Her vexed family promises great riches to anyone who can force her to speak.  A very-sure-of-himself tiger arrives to do the job correctly.  The ending of this one had me grinning.  \\"The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish\\" is a great story about another otherwise occupied parent.  This time he gets traded away for two goldfish who interest his son much more than he does.  Trouble arises when the boy realizes he's in big trouble when mom returns home!  The final story is a poem called \\"Crazy Hair\\" which any kid who has ever moaned at having his/hair brushed can relate to.  The disk ends with a sweet interview of the author who is questioned by his young daughter.<br /><br />I've already listened to this twice and will probably read it several more times on my portable player because it's so darned charming.	2005-02-11

Not having read \\"The Red Tent\\" I had nothing to compare \\"Good Harbor\\" to (for good or bad).  Overall I all enjoyed listening to this in the morning but I wasn't nearly as emotional as I'd expected it to be which is good, I guess, because I expected it to ruin my makeup.  On the downside, this is a book I won't remember come next week . . .<br /><br />It was a nice, gentle tale about the distance that can develop between couples that often goes unnoticed but it was also a book about the power of friendship between women and the special bond and sharing that occurs when two friend's just \\"click\\".<br /><br />Both women came across as very realistic but somehow I always remained at a distance from them both.  Joyce's attitude towards her \\"romance\\" novel (which paid for her summer home ~ I'd love to know who her agent was as new romance novelists are typically paid a slaves wage!) rubbed me the wrong way on more than one occasion though. Her troubles with her bratty daughter were very realistically portrayed and her loneliness well done but in the end I still sympathized much more with Kathleen's character (though, in the end, she nearly lost me as well).<br /><br />This isn't a book I'd read again but I am interested in picking up \\"The Red Tent\\" after reading many of the reviews here.	2005-02-07

The story is told from the point of view of pre-teen Jack whose current and past fears haunt the story. Unlike most action-packed, gore filled zombie tales this one concentrates more on the emotions of its characters. And also unlike most zombie stories the zombies aren't the only ones who appear to be affected by whatever has infected them. The grass, the trees, the bugs, everything seems to be decaying on the inside and the animals are eerily quiet. . . All of this sets a haunting mood that never lets up. Not exactly uplifting but great stuff all the same! I'll have to rescue the rest of Lebbon's stuff from my tbr pile.	2005-01-24

Before long she finds herself abandoned by her mother, where she eventually locates her grandmother who she doesn't know at all. Grandma dumps her off at a sanctuary where Linnett finds there are others just like herself who live sheltered from the media and others who would exploit their kind.<br /><br />As Linnett learns to adjust to her new surroundings and attempts to fit in with the assorted group of winged and \\"cutwings\\" she realizes that being safe and sheltered is also a bit stifling when one wants nothing more than to fly free.<br /><br />This was a short, intriguing little read whose ending left me wanting more. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that this author has written much of anything since this book was published in 2002 and according to the Firebirdbook website she's not on the line up for 2005 :(	2005-01-24

Maggie Osborne is an author who doesn't write your typical whiny, helpless, feminine heroine which is why I love her books so much and continue to buy them new.<br /><br />Fox, one the best scouts around, and her elderly friend Peaches are eeking out a living selling ice when Fox is approached to lead an expedition by a man named Tanner who tempts her with lots of gold pieces (and his ruggedly good looks, though she'll never admit it).

When she discovers Tanner's true reason for the expedition she can't refuse even though the trip will quite possibly put all of their lives in danger. During the course of the trip Fox and Tanner begin a \\"liason\\" that quickly turns into a love with no future.<br /><br />This book was a great western road trip with a foul mouth, rough around the edges heroine.

I very much enjoyed the world Kim Harrison is developing and the dynamics between the different characters.<br /><br />The first 1st 100 or so pages were interesting but a bit hard to get into. I was a bit confused about living vs. dead vamps and witches and was slightly annoyed that the ominous \\"Turn\\" was talked about for pages on end before it was finally explained (loved the explanation ~ just wish it had occurred<br /><br />sooner). The author throws around lots of unfamiliar slang which also doesn't help out with the confusion.<br /><br />I did read this directly on the heels of Laurell K. Hamilton's latest, \\"Incubus Dreams\\", and couldn't help wishing that Rachel had a bit more of a kick-a*s attitude.  She's tough but<br /><br />needed to be saved by others just a wee too much for my liking.  But, as I said, this could also be due to the fact that I'd just read an Anita Blake novel.<br /><br />The blend of action, humor and character interaction was just right and the author has created some very intriguing secondary characters.  I want to find out more about Rachel, her vampire friend Ivy and Nick (is he or isn't he entirely human?) and can't wait to see more of Jenk's the sexy little pixie man.  The romance is very slight but it shows potential in the future.	2004-12-21

Incubus Dreams begins at the wedding of Larry & Tammy (whom after this interlude are not mentioned again). Anita is one of Larry's groomsmen. Her dates are Micah and Nathaniel (hey, why bring one when you can have two?!). Anita's trying to duck out on dancing with them when she's called to visit a murder scene. Yay, a murder investigation, I thought, the book is getting back to its roots! No need to get excited, though, as it's only for a moment then we get back to the sex.<br /><br />As expected at this point in the series, the book features lots of sexual tension with Nathaniel (he of the beautiful violet eyes and desire to be bound and beaten) and Damien, and Asher, and Richard, and Jean Claude and Micah and . . . well, you get the picture. When the book begins Micah is Anita's #1 bedmate and partner but as the book progresses Nathaniel finally moves up a little in the ranks. I was thrilled to see this as I have a soft spot for Nathaniel.<br /><br />This book was described to me by a friend who enjoyed the earlier books as \\"boring porn\\" and I can easily see why she felt this way. The sex with strangers which fills far too many pages is dull, unnecessary and frustratingly vanilla. How many men does Anita need in her harem anyway? It has reached ridiculous proportions. She'd be waddling like a penguin if she were entirely human . . . If the book had been subjected to a little editing I'm thinking it could've been oh-so much better.<br /><br />However, I still thought it was much better than the last few Anita Blake books because the author does delve a little deeper into some of the relationships. The Jean Claude/Richard triangle is explored. Micah breaks down and becomes more than just another pretty face (though he's quickly forgotten for most of the book). Nathaniel comes into his own (take that however you will) and becomes a little less of a doormat for Anita to use for feeding her various hungers and for cooking and cleaning. Hey, where can I get a Nathaniel, anyway?<br /><br />The plot is all over the place. At one point Anita is called in to raise a zombie. I'd almost forgotten she's a necromancer so it was nice to see her \\"working\\" again. But that plot thread, which I found very interesting, quickly went nowhere. She's also called in to investigate a suspected vampire serial killer targeting strippers. This plot fizzles and limps to a less than fulfilling end. In between the short moments of work, Anita seems to be angsting about the way her life has turned out and dealing with the ardeur while attempting to reconcile her feelings and complicated relationships with all of her boys.<br /><br />Incubus Dreams managed to hold my attention for most of its many pages which is something most books can't manage to do these days so I'm sure I'll read the next one.anyway?<br /><br />The plot is all over the place.

Hmmm, maybe it's my mood but the heroine of this book came across as snarky and immature as opposed to \\"witty\\" and \\"fun\\" as I've seen her described elsewhere. Maybe I'm just a grouch but the author manages to lampoon Wiccan's and Goth's and romance reader's in a way that is more insulting than hysterical.<br /><br />I ended up throwing in the towel at 100 pages. It just wasn't funny.  The heroine and her friend come across as a pair of idiots.  Running off to Eastern Europe to find a group of vampires she's read about in a FICTIONAL novel?!

(no, even Roxy is not quite that stupid ~ she knows she'll nab a vamp because no man can resist her gorgeousness - puleez). Roxy drags Joy (the heroine) along for the ride and silly conversations take center stage.<br /><br />This exchange, following many just like it, is what finally did me in:<br /><br />The heroine to who I'm guessing is supposed to be the love interest:<br /><br />\\"For your information Mr. So-Stuck-On-Yourself-You-Probably-Attract-Flies, I was not flirting!

The world he writes about is bleak, devasting and brutal.

Only Shella, a street toughened dancer, ever saw beneath the hard shell. They are separated when Ghost is thrown in jail and now that he's out his one goal is to find Shella.<br /><br />This is an interesting look into the life of a killer. How cold-heartedly it happens out of necessity and survival. The book is bleak (have I said that already?) and disturbing.

The author, naturally, has many advantages over her co-workers and this shows through loud and clear during her experiment. She also has a somewhat elitist attitude towards those she works with and constantly reminds us of her Phd and how \\"over-qualified\\" she is for many of these jobs.<br /><br />No doubt, it will surely be an eye opening book for those who've never had the experience of growing up in this sort of situation (or never getting the opportunity to get out of it). For me it was an all too painful a reminder of my teen years and the horrible job at a fast food joint where I worked double shifts, was often called a peon by management and went home smelling and feeling like I'd been dipped in the fry-o-later all for a measly pittance. Finishing school and taking a few college courses changed the course of my life but many don't have this option (or realize it too late). It's difficult to advance past an entry level job when one needs such luxuries as food and shelter and then if you throw children into the mix things are pretty glum. This book mainly made me sad but there were a few moments of light and genuine human kindness.<br /><br />However, in the end this book turns out to be just one woman's very limited experiences. I completely agree with her that it is very difficult (near impossible) to get out of the entry level job once you're knee deep in debt or have children and are no longer collecting (or never have) welfare. But I do have issues with her Welfare Reform rants and it is painfully obvious that she is looking at this from an outsiders point of view. She rants at length about the evils of Welfare Reform (and I agree with some points ~ some people just can't make it on their own) but she doesn't once state that some positives can and DO come out of it. It enables (or at least it did in the early/mid 90's) under-educated people with drive and desire to go out and gain a certificate or learn a trade at the state's expense that can be a stepping stone for a life-long career not just a mindless job. Back in the 90's when I was barely out of my teens I could have quit my entry level receptionist's job, had a baby out of wedlock and signed up for welfare. My daycare costs would've been mostly covered (I know someone who paid $12 a week while I paid $150 up until last year), I would've been eligible for discounted housing (called Section 8 in Mass) & free schooling (I would've loved to have been able to learn how to style hair but couldn't afford the classes & would've had to quit my job to attend). Instead I scraped by and slowly took a few college courses which I paid for while slowly gaining on-the-job knowledge and moving up in the ranks. So, while Welfare Reform isn't perfect by any means it also isn't always the big bad evil thing that the author makes it out to be . . . I think she should've interviewed a few more people than the small number she did before she made such one-sided statements to suit her closing arguments in her book and rushing back to her \\"upper middle class\\" lifestyle.drive and desire to go out and gain a certificate or learn a trade at the state's expense that can be a stepping stone for a life-long career not just a mindless job.

I think she should've interviewed a few more people than the small number she did before she made such one-sided statements to suit her closing arguments in her book and rushing back to her \\"upper middle class\\" lifestyle.	2004-11-24

I read this as an unabridged audio book and it's a good thing too because if I were reading this in its paperback format I do believe I would've put it down unfinished after the first few chapters.  Admittedly, I'm easily bored these days but this story was just too slow paced and peopled with characters that are (more often than not) difficult to sympathize with for me to anxiously continue turning its pages with any sort of enthusiasm.  However, being trapped as I am in my vehicle for long stretches of time I'm content to listen to most anything if it distracts me from the tedium of driving and thus I finished every CD until I reached the bitter end.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of its three main characters starting with fifteen year old Rayona and working backwards through events which are told by her mother Christine and finally by Christine's mother \\"Aunt\\" Ida.  This technique makes one sit back and say \\"ahhh, so that somewhat explains why \\"so and so\\" was such an unlikable witch earlier in the book\\" but it also makes for tough reading because it's difficult to sympathize with Christine and \\"Aunt\\" Ida for long stretches of the novel.  Once we learn their motivations for certain actions they often turn out to be the ones who made poor choices resulting in their current miserable situations.<br /><br />The novel begins when Rayona is unceremoniously abandoned by her mother Christine at \\"Aunt\\" Ida's home on an Indian reservation who (if this possible) is even less caring and nurturing than selfish Christine. Christine hitches a ride and doesn't look back leaving Rayona to deal with grumpy Ida who takes her in but leaves her to fend for herself. Rayona, friendless, lonely and finding it difficult to fit in becomes a \\"project\\" to the local preacher who hovers over her in a somewhat creepy way (if'n you ask me). This is only a small snapshot of what appears to be a long stretch of instability in Rayona's young life. Rayona tells the story for roughly 1/3 of the book and, in my eyes, was the most sympathetic of the three and showed a lot of guts for a kid on her own.<br /><br />The focus then switches to her mom Christine who shows us a bit of her past.  We experience the ups and downs of her wild days as a single gal living on her own after she's escaped the confines of life on the reservation.  Her secret heartache is revealed and we relive her love affair with Rayona's faithless father.  Still, despite all of her pain she always remained a selfish \\"me, me, me\\" type of person who I couldn't warm up to and a lot of her troubles were of her own making, in my opinion.  Next up the story switches to Ida, whose past I found the most interesting.  She fills in many gaps and her past answers a lot of questions that cropped up while I was reading Rayona & Christine's point of view.  Again, though, in the end Ida is too brusque and difficult to warm up to despite the painful choice thrust upon her as a youngster.<br /><br />Overall this story manages to be both depressing and compassionate but the bleakness left me in a very melancholy mood when I finished.  Two of the three characters love deeply but show it in all the wrong ways and I fear the third may follow their footsteps with such guidance.  . .ughly 1/3 of the book and, in my eyes, was the most sympathetic of the three and showed a lot of guts for a kid on her own.<br /><br />The focus then switches to her mom Christine who shows us a bit of her past.

This dark & gritty unabridged audiobook was the perfect choice for a dreary, misty morning ride to work.  This was my first glimpse into the world of Alex Cross and once I finished this book I realized I've been missing out on some potentially excellent reads.  Most hardboiled mysteries are too dry for my tastes and my mind starts drifting away but this one hooked me from the beginning with its attention to characterization and the emotional affects of crime on the victims left behind.<br /><br />The story, though grueling, moves along at a fast pace and held my attention throughout. Police Officer Alex Cross is a compelling and sympathetic character chasing down one of the evilest serial killers I've encountered in quite a while.  The killer fancies himself as \\"Death\\" in a role playing game he and his three cronies call \\"The Four Horsemen\\".  \\"Death\\" takes his role far too seriously and is a truly revolting, heartless, selfish and sadistic character.  My only complaint is the plot twist that occurs on Disk 4 which was very predictable due to the author's overuse of happy adjectives in the previous chapters.<br /><br />The book only slowed down a bit for me during the trial but I've never been a fan of court room drama anyway and the ending left me wanting more (which is a good thing if there's a sequel -- not so good if this is the end!). All in all I'm thrilled to discover a new author with a considerable backlist to devour.	2004-11-08

A little past the half way mark his constant descriptions of their hedonistic world and the ever-changing group of so-called friends exhausted me. It was an interesting book at turns hilariously funny and yet depressingly melancholy. The lengths these kids took to be the center of attention and fill their lives with excitement was devasting. The backstabbing and bitter resentment of each other and the utter lack of any sort of real connection with others besides the surface was what saddened me the most.<br /><br />This was quick read and James St. James has a wonderful sense of humor that I enjoyed reading despite some repetitiveness.  I'd love to read more of his witticisms in a fiction novel someday.	2004-11-05

I read this in its unabridged audiobook format and was initially held spellbound.  At first glance, this isn't a book I'd pick up and read on my own which is is probably why I didn't purchase it before now but I always enjoy Stephen King's voice and the first story \\"Low Men In Yellow Coats\\" is no exception.<br /><br />It clocks in at 320+ pages and is a novel in and of itself.  \\"Low Men\\" tells the story of Bobby, a young boy growing up in the 60's with a bitter, angry mother who claims to love him but who definitely does not like him.  He has a small group of friends who dodge town bullies but finds true kinship with an old man named Ted who has an odd secret.  When Bobby's mom goes away on business Ted looks after Bobby.  During their time together Bobby learns many truths, some ugly some stunning. It's funny and heartbreaking.  Great stuff.<br /><br />The second story \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\", unfortunately, didn't do it for me and I often found my drifty mind floating away as I pondered all of the laundry that I had left to do when I returned home from work.  The rewind button got a lot of use during the rest of this audiobook . . . It's basically about a group of college students living through the Vietnam War.  The boys do a lot of trash talking and play a card game called \\"Hearts\\" which becomes an obssession for many of them.  As the Vietnam war protests heat up and these guys fear expulsion for their lackluster grades the plot plods on . . .<br /><br />Next up is the story of one of the unlikable kids featured in the first novella.  Will is all grown up but is haunted by his past, particularly the incident that made him such an unlikable character for me in \\"Low Men\\".  This story, like the previous one, was unremarkable and tough to get through. Same goes for the next two stories which wrap up a few loose ends.  I wish I had stopped the audio after reading \\"Low Men\\" but I'm a glutton for punishment.	2004-11-03

Hey, I finished an actual book in its entirety without skimming!  For this fact alone I give this my hightest rating.  Because I still haven't got around to reading Bitten (which I bought when it was first released in hardcover) or its sequel Stolen I had to pay very close attention to the first few chapters to get acquainted with Armstrong's world.  It also took me a few chapters to figure out who was who and what they had to do with the current story but once I got caught up the pages began to fly.  There were a few conversations between Paige and Elena that I thought added nothing to this story but I may change mind when I go back and read the first two books.<br /><br />I liked Paige early on.  She's tough and gutsy and vulnerable as well but a little too trusting of certain people (though I'm betting this aspect of her personality changes in the sequel).  Savannah was also a very believable teen dealing quite well with all of the gore and upheaval in her life.  I particularly enjoyed the wise-a*s humor and the non-stop tension (sexual and otherwise).  It reminded, in a way, of the earliest Laurell K. Hamilton books.<br /><br />Armstrong's world where witches and cabals work behind the scenes while modern day life ticks on was interesting.  The fact that the \\"supernaturals\\" have to hide their abilities from normal folks was a nice touch but the jabs at Wiccans who are all portrayed as stereotypical loonies who live to rip off their clothing and romp in the woods got old quickly.<br /><br />Dime Store Magic was a page-turner despite my little quibbles.  Now I'll have to dig out Bitten . . .	2004-10-27

He read it with gusto, emphasizing each \\"Boooooo\\" but overall found it a bit boring and not at all \\"hilarious\\" (unlike Dragon's Halloween by Dav Pilkey which had us both smiling from beginning to end). The repetitiveness of the repeated rhyming patterns was dull for a big kid (3rd grade) and the creatures too spooky for my younger daughter (1st grade) who is not into ghoulies at all. The \\"mad doctor\\" brought back some memories of lost hours I'd like to recover while watching Stephen King's \\"Kingdom Hospital\\" but other than that I found it pretty blah as well. Save your $ and buy the charming Pilkey book instead.	2004-10-19

Feeling horrible about the state of her life she embarks on a road trip to locate her 80's crush, Andrew McCarthy, who she just knows will be able to help her figure out why life didn't turn out like the ending of one of those brat pack movies she adored.<br /><br />This book is very light, with some sharp-edged humor (although I must admit that a lot of it went over my head as it's very UK based) and some over the top outrageous characters (a giant transvestite, anyone?).  Julia and Ellie, like most chick-lit types, are a little too shallow for my liking but not so much so that was overly annoyed. Loved the bit where Julia and Ellie ran into C. Thomas (call me Thom) Howell. It brought back some long buried memories and gave me some terrifying dreams of my old skyhigh 80's hair. This book also brought to life in horrifying technicolor my memories of Madonna black rubber bracelets, the crush on Corey Hart and the endless hours spent spraying my hair into a perfect rats nest.

There are a lot of games, spells and other assorted crafts that are perfect for little ones. My favorite section to read were the recipes (specifically the desserts) that come with their own cute little enchantments.<br /><br />Although, a slight caveat is coming here. The recipe for Candied Love Apples features a big oopsie & makes me wonder if the author ever tried to make these herself. It says to place all of the various sugars in a pan on medium heat for 8-10 mins and then begin dipping the apples. Uh, uh. Doesn't work. Trust me on this. Try more like 20-30 mins of continued boiling (and NO stirring which the author also doesn't mention). It also would've helped to have a tip or two about using a candy thermometer to test for doneness or at the least a mention of using the old drop in cold water and it's done when you see threads trick. Also a word of warning:  WEAR SOCKS AND SHOES AT ALL COSTS. I make candles and should've known better but I'm also blonde and tend to forget these things. No bare feet, no pretty little open toed sandals. They do not mix with this recipe. I discovered the hard way that hot candy dropped on bare toesies hurts for weeks.  You've been warned.<br /><br />As for me, I don't know if I'm brave enough to attempt another of Silver's recipes but the games appear fun . . .	2004-10-14

This was my first book by Anna Quindlen and I purposely did not read reviews because I love surprises and I came across many as I read this unabridged audiobook (forgive me for any name misspellings).<br /><br /> The story starts out when two teens drive up to a fancy schmancy estate called &quot;Blessings&quot; and leave a mysterious box.<br /><br /> The newest caretaker, Skip Cutty (Cuttie?), discovers the box. When he sees the beautiful baby girl bundled inside he impulsively decides to keep and care her. Because he's an ex-convict on parole (he's a good guy but was in the wrong place at the wrong time) he knows this is the last thing he should be doing but his heart tells him it is right. So Skip securely straps the baby, who he names Faith, to his chest as he performs his daily tasks and does his best to keep her a secret from the other employees at Blessings.<br /><br /> Mrs. Blessing the brittle, set-in-her-ways dowager of the Blessing estate enjoys spying on her employees with binoculars and is very curious about Skip. Eventually Mrs. Blessings discovers Skip's secret but much to his surprise agrees to keep the baby a secret, even going so far as helping him care for Faith.<br /><br /> Slowly a friendship and trust develop between Mrs. Blessing, Skip and a young lady named Jennifer. The bulk of the story is told from Mrs. Blessing's point of view as she questions many of the choices she made during her long life and regrets the way she lived her life and raised her daughter (their relationship is distant at best). Skip and baby Faith seem to be the catalyst for her reflection.<br /><br /> I enjoyed this book. The writing is absolutely beautiful however I would've enjoyed it more if the story had been told more from the point of view of Skip. Mrs. Blessing wasn't nearly as interesting to me as Skip. Here is this young guy who has stumbled through life with very little love and the lowest of expectations. As expected his childhood friends all turn into hoodlums but Skip wants something more, even though he never knows quite what that may be (to simply be a respectable person maybe?). Instead of using his past as a crutch, as so many with his background tend to do, he decides to work hard and do the best he can. His love for Faith was exquisitely portrayed and lovely to read.<br /><br /> I'm glad I had the opportunity to spend some time with Skip, Jennifer, baby Faith, the cranky housekeeper Nadine and even Mrs. Blessing.s but Skip wants something more, even though he never knows quite what that may be (to simply be a respectable person maybe?).

Contained within are stories that are warm and fuzzy, hilarious and downright heartbreaking (though most are on the lighter side).  As is the case with most anthologies, some of the stories just couldn't hold my interest (the more techie sci-fi based ones) but for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed these mini-romps with odd pets of all sorts and sizes.<br />Starting things off is Nina Kiriki Hoffman's &quot;Objects of Desire&quot; which tells the tale of a youngster named Kirby who wants a &quot;skewlis&quot; so much it hurts.  Everyone she knew had one of the weasel-crossed-with-a-cat, lemon and incense smelling critters but her mom was down on her luck and short on cash.  A &quot;skewlis&quot;, the latest fad of the moment, was completely out of her reach.  Kirby's surprised when her grandma gives her one as a gift.  Grandma's a bargain hunter so Kirby's skewlis isn't exactly top-of-the-line but Kirby loves her anyway.  Of course, the skewlis turns out to be more than it appears and Kirby learns an important lesson about &quot;wanting&quot; stuff.<br />Other favorites of mine were:  &quot;What Fluffy Knew&quot; a creepy little tale about an alien invasion told from the point of view of a spoiled housecat named Fluffy who takes it upon herself to save her family when mini-aliens invade.  &quot;Diamonds&quot; by Michelle West is a story of a lonely boy who was always told he &quot;was a mistake&quot;.  When he discovers a secret hidden away in his parents bedroom he finds a friend, learns the importance of freedom and eventually finds love and acceptance.<br />&quot;Dog Is My Co-pilot&quot; is one of my favorites of the bunch.  It's an often humorous tale about a lonesome pilot named Frank whose company decides to engineer the perfect companion for its employees.  They've altered dogs that will live longer lives and speak their minds and ease the loneliness that often overwhelms their employee's.  Frank's pal is quite a character who changes his name to suit his many moods.  Some days he's the dignified Charles, other days he's simply Charlie or Chuck but whatever he may be calling himself he always remains Frank's best pal.  One day the two find themselves stranded without a ship and are &quot;rescued&quot; by a rogue dog who quickly abandons Frank and takes off with Charlie.  Stranded and feeling horribly betrayed, Frank is soon taken in by a group of harmless looking aliens.  All ends will for Frank and Charlie in this good humored tale.<br />Other notable stories for me were &quot;In The Storm, In The Stars&quot; which is a different spin on the legendary unicorn.  It's a painful read for an animal lover like me and ends on a somewhat bittersweet note.  And, &quot;Elmer&quot;, a tale of a young boy who finds an amoeba-like creature while investigating what appears to be a crashed meteor.  One fateful day he discovers it has miraculous powers.  This story is a tad more gruesome than all of the others which tend to be on the tame side and it deals with some weightier subjects like death and grief.<br />I'd recommend this to any pet lover looking for something out of the ordinary.a character who changes his name to suit his many moods.

My husband and I listened to most of this unabridged reading while painting our kitchen. He was enthralled with all of the little secrets and thought it very exciting. I, on the other hand, found it tedious and repetitive and soon felt trapped in my kitchen with no escape in sight. The characters lacked personality and the voice of the protagonist's love interest (her name escapes me now) was cringe worthy and sent shudders of horror down my spine every time she &quot;spoke&quot;.

Demons have invaded and are gleefully ripping humans to shreds one by one.<br />I listened to this as an Audible downloand and, apparently, this book is two books in one.  Book 1 tells Ira's story and his battle with the Demons.  This story began with a rip-roaring start but petered out somewhere mid-way when Ira, the woman he's in love with and a group of men who belong to a secret society attempt to figure out how to defeat the demons and reclaim their world.  I lost interest midway as the story got bogged down in a lot of metaphysical talk and seemed to skip around too much for my liking.  It also wasn't as &quot;horrific&quot; as I'd anticipated considering the plot.  The ideas are all there (and are indeed frightening) but the telling of the story just didn't do it for me.<br />Unfortunately, Book 2 wasn't any better of a read for me.  It takes place some nine years later and this time a group of greedy, power hungry folks foolishly thinking they're gods bring the demons back to life but not before the book goes into horrifying details about the evils these people are doing the environment.  Ewww, for me it was a thoroughly unpleasant (and often boring) story.  Not helping matters out any is the overblown reading by one of the male narrators who gets so worked up and gasps for breath so many times during his reading I thought he was surely going to expire from the effort.<br />I much preferred John Shirley's book &quot;New Noir&quot; over this one.	2004-06-28

She's immediately put off by the sleazy location but plays along entering a white walled room filled only with a bright light and what appears to be a doctor's examination table.  She hops up on the table as instructed but is soon sucking in noxious fumes and knocked unconscious . . .<br />Next we meet Dr. Toby Harper who works the graveyard shift in the emergency room.  One night an old man appears in the ER with no apparent illness besides a penchant for stripping off his clothes in public and a bit of disorientation.  As Toby goes about examining him his leg starts to twitch.  She's called out on another call and when she returns he has disappeared and Toby is held responsible.  Soon another old man arrives (who was, coincidentally, living in the same fancy retirement community as the first mystery man) with similar symptoms but this man dies.  Toby is suspicious, orders an autopsy and does some snooping around on her own when she is met with unreasonable resistance to her questions.  It seems that some experimentation with prolonging life has been going on at the retirement home with frightening side effects.  When Toby eventually discovers a bit of what has been going on her own life becomes endangered.<br />This was an interesting medical thriller with an engaging protagonist but once Tape 2 begins the abridgement becomes very apparent.  Events begin to happen fast and furiously and characterization is minimal.  For the most part, the cuts necessary for this abridgement are smooth but I did find myself left a bit confused on more than one occasion and would've loved to have gotten to know all of the players a bit better.  If I stumble across an uncut version of \\"Life Support\\" I'll definitely check it out to read all that I missed.	2004-06-18

Since when? Or are they insinuating that modern day witchcraft = Satanism/vampirism. If that's the case someone really needs to do some homework. I sure hope the book is researched better than the back cover copy . . .<br />The Embrace is the author's pieced together account of a vicious true life crime perpetuated by a vicious, disturbed young man who believed he was immortal (among other wacked out theories).  Rod Ferrell and his group of mindless followers are aimlessly traveling from Kentucky to Florida where Ferrell intends to add his ex-girlfriend Heather to his \\"coven\\", kill Heather's parents and steal their vehicle.  The group then plans to head to New Orleans and crash with Ferrell's \\"vampire\\" friends.  The sheep-like clan members don't take Ferrell's claims of murder seriously and laugh it off.  Unfortunately, he wasn't kidding around and they find themselves accessories to a crime that is anything but funny.<br />I won't comment on how accurate this retelling of the events leading to the murder happens to be as I was completely unfamiliar with the case until now.  The book reads like what I'm assuming it is:  a collection of interviews pieced together by the author.  The problem lies with the dull way the author presents her material.  The book is extremely tedious and very repetitive and could've been trimmed by a hundred or more pages.  This all makes for a very dull read for anyone not familiar with this case.	2004-06-17

The recording ends with a step-by-step ritual.<br />This is a good place to start for anyone interested in learning what Wicca is all about.  However there is a lot of information packed into the first section that only briefly touches on subjects that will require further reading for anyone seriously interested in practicing Wicca.  That's not really a complaint as there are so many aspects of Wicca that they could never properly be detailed in one tome (well, it may be possible but the thing would weigh several tons and be impossible to lug around!).  Still, I do wish this audio were longer than a little over one hour as I very much enjoyed Starhawk's narration and her informative writing skills.	2004-06-16

All He Ever Wanted begins with a hotel fire in the early 1900's. The narrator of the story (who is recounting his past while en route to his sister's funeral) bachelor Nicholas Van Tassel, a stuffy professor at a snotty boys' school, is inside the hotel when the blaze begins but leaves unscathed.  During this tragedy where twenty people perish in a fiery death he meets the woman of his dreams, Etna Bliss.<br />Etna's \\"handsome\\" face, her lovely waist and her other womanly attributes haunt his every thought.  Even her name, Bliss, brings lusty thoughts to his mind (and starts my skin to crawling).  His infatuation is all consuming and before long he begins to pursue her with all of the gusto of a starving dog drooling over a choice bit of meat.  She eventually agrees to a date where he learns, a bit to his dismay, that she has a brain as well as fine breasts and is surprisingly literate.  They read stories together and seem to get along well but when he makes a move or turns the conversation towards the personal she immediately gives him the cold shoulder.  I should add that Nicholas is described as the most un-athletic man on earth with a slight paunch and a balding pate.  The sexual attraction seems entirely one-sided and a bit creepy.  At this point I would've put the book aside unfinished as I found Nicholas Van Tassel boring beyond belief and far too pompous.  However, since I was listening to this in its unabridged format and I was stuck in traffic I continued to torture myself with Nicholas Van Tassel's words (expertly read by a narrator who reads in a purposely haughty way).<br />Despite the fact that Etna does not return his feelings of undying love he insists that they marry and, oddly enough, she agrees!  Thus begins their awkward life together.  During their years of marriage they parent two children (and, thakfully, we are spared the oogey details of their sterile love making ~ thank you Mr. Van Tassel for speedily skipping by those bits and saving me a few shudders!) and seem to get along decently enough as they plod along through their days.  Nicholas gives Etna a nice life and the freedom to do whatever she wishes but sadly the love Nicholas aches for is never returned by Etna.  Nicholas, the poor love starved sap, is grateful just to have her for his wife and doesn't complain about her complete lack of affection towards him.  But things begin to change when he discovers that Etna has been hiding things from him.  This is where the book finally picked up and actually engaged my full attention.<br />At this point Nicholas *almost* becomes a sympathetic character if you can believe it (though he is still a thoroughly unpleasant fellow)!  He is riddled with insecurities and although he has been married to a woman he cherishes for years he will never be a happy or successful man.  His world begins to spiral out of control as he simultaneously discovers Etna's been keeping secrets and learns the position he's been longing to have at the University may be forever out of his reach.<br />Nicholas's festering jealously and over-reaction to Etna's secret (which was odd but not nearly as devastatingly earth-shattering as I'd anticipated), however, ruin any smidgen of pity I may have felt for him just a few chapters earlier.  Author Shreve successfully paints an unpleasant picture of a thoroughly unpleasant man caught up in a situation of his own making.  Reading Nicolas Van Tassel's vitriolic comments and actions for pages on end was a depressing experience that I won't be repeating any time soon!few shudders!) and seem to get along decently enough as they plod along through their days.

See, it seems that Tansy wasn't the only one practicing witchcraft and the grasping wives of Norman's colleagues at the college have been practicing as well.  Now, what with the protections ceasing to exist, the Saylor's are wide open to dangerous forces that do not wish them well!<br />Initially I found this book very interesting and it pleasantly reminded me of those old black and white creepy movies I used to watch during my childhood.  Sadly, as I continued to read I somehow lost my way and found it difficult to maintain my enthusiasm to turn the pages.  The story mainly consists of Norman's internal monologue and his attempt to find a solution to the heart-rending predicament in which he finds himself.  Maybe it was my mood, maybe it was the dated feel of the story or maybe it was the format but I found the book a tad too slow moving and too easy to put down.  Though it was exceptionally creepy at times it just didn't click with me.	2004-06-14
US	52186522	RCE17B0SI528R	0385508417	999720718	Skipping Christmas	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Cute but not quite what I'd consider side-splittingly funny	3 1/2 stars.  I read this slight Christmas story as an unabridged audiobook in the balmy month of June.  I must say that reading this in the summer did not make me all gushy and wistful for the hectic Christmas season (which, I'm guessing is the point of this silly little tale)!<br />Luther Krank is quite disgusted by the commercialism of Christmas and the thousands of dollars he wastes every year on the season. This year, since his daughter is out of the country, he decides to skip it altogether and spend the holiday with his wife on a Caribbean cruise. He's looking forward to the trip and counting up all of the money he's sure to save.  His wife, Nora, reluctantly agrees to Luther's plan and the two embark on a diet to shed a few pounds before their trip. Unfortunately, Luther's nosy neighbors and co-workers can't seem to understand the whole &quot;skipping Christmas&quot; concept and nag him to reconsider.<br />Between the nagging neighbors, the solicitors hounding him for money and his ravenous hunger pangs, Luther is a man living on the edge. When the fire department arrives at the door peddling fruitcakes Luther is so ravenous he actually considers grabbing one of the noxious things for himself.  Little episodes like these fill the book with a sense of fun despite the often irritating plot twists (and even more irritating friends and neighbors). Poor Luther just can't get a break and I plugged away hoping he'd eventually escape the madness and get to enjoy his well deserved vacation.<br />This is a cute story about the ridiculousness of the Christmas season and the foolishness of rushing around like mad-people.  Though the ending isn't quite what I was hoping for it was written with a lot of heart.  I'm a bit too grumpy to appreciate the gushing sentiment and the feelings of goodwill but I'm sure the ending will satisfy those looking for such things.	2004-06-14
US	52186522	R1CNBNQMETIYTY	0788769049	333083668	The Memory of Running	Books	5	97	107	N	N	An audio I'll listen to again and again	Stephen King personally insisted that I read this book (okay, he recommended it to me AND thousands of others in an Entertainment Weekly column) so here I am.  His write up was so enthusiastic that I couldn't resist.  And I'm glad I didn't.<br />The Memory of Running is the story of Smithson Ide, your everyday boy next door growing up in New England during the 60's.  The story is told in a series of flashbacks and narrated by 40something Smithy.<br />Smithy's sister Bethany constantly told him to keep running or he'd turn into a fat ass and she wasn't kidding.  Smithy has grown from a slender boy who loved to run into an overweight, junk eating, chain-smoking laze-about with little ambition and a great fondness for the television set.  He lives a monotonous, shut-in sort of life but has managed to maintain an aura of sweetness and innocence when, as we learn more of his past, he could've easily become jaded and bitter.  When his parents tragically die he revisits his past, rekindles a friendship with a long neglected friend and hops on a bicycle in his funeral suit (!) to work through his grief.  During his trip from Rhode Island to California he meets all sorts of fascinating people with stories to tell and recounts his very interesting and often heartbreaking past.<br />The story starts a bit slowly but quickly picks up pace.  As it went on I found myself making excuses to stay in the car or take a longer route home so I hear just a few more words. Smithy grew up with an older sister, Bethany, who he, his mom and his pop loved very much.  Bethany was beautiful and smart but began to hear \\"voices\\" as a young teen.  The \\"voice\\" makes Bethany do bizarre; out of character, shameful things like strip her clothes in public, tear at her pretty face, stand in odd poses for hours on end and disappear.  Smithy spends much of his childhood biking around looking for Bethany and hates Bethany's \\"voice\\" though he always continues to love Bethany even when she's cruel.<br />The story flips between Smithy's current day wonderings where he meets all sorts of folks and has some downright odd encounters and flashes back to his past where he goes into detail about important points in his young life; from dating foibles, to the fateful day when a childhood friend's vibrant personality was forever changed and he details many of Bethany's \\"episodes\\" which had a huge impact on his young life.  You really get to know these folks in the span of this book and I was sorry to let them go when I finished.<br />The story it isn't always perfect (some of the dialogue feels unreal and the story shifts are sometimes too abrupt for my liking) but despite the minor quibbles it is one of the most involving things I've read in quite a while and author McLarty's narration is seamlessly performed.  Filled with unexpected twists, beautifully detailed settings and a gut wrenching sense of emotional intensity The Memory of Running is a book I'll be revisiting many times.story flips between Smithy's current day wonderings where he meets all sorts of folks and has some downright odd encounters and flashes back to his past where he goes into detail about important points in his young life; from dating foibles, to the fateful day when a childhood friend's vibrant personality was forever changed and he details many of Bethany's \\"episodes\\" which had a huge impact on his young life.

Now in her early thirties, her star has faded a bit since her glory days and she's working as a morning DJ in London and creating quite a buzz with her all-request format highlighting important glimpses into her listeners lives. While Helena's working life seems to be in order her emotional life is quite another story. After meeting up with a former band member at an awards ceremony Helena is coerced into temporarily mending her woes with a dose of cocaine. This poor choice leads to a horrifyingly stupid and very public accident that leaves her badly disfigured and makes all the tabloids. Her weaselly boss visits her hospital bed with news that he intends to give her plenty of time to heal and that she can come back to work doing the graveyard shift (what a guy, eh?). She's furious and terribly depressed and comes up with \\"The Plan\\". \\"The Plan\\" will be her ultimate goodbye to the world in which she'll write up a request list of her own. Each song she plays during her final show will remind her of a special memory from her past which she'll share with her listeners.<br />This book tackles some weighty subjects; serious illness, imperfect selfish parents and suicidal thoughts but it is also just witty enough to keep one from feeling thoroughly depressed. 30ish Helena is a broken, jaded, lonely and emotionally drained young woman who, being on the road for a good chunk of her life, never took the time to form close friendships outside of her male bandmates and her childhood friend Sam. As she's recovering from her accident she meets Toby, a cute guy with a young daughter and a comatose wife. Toby and Helena make an immediate connection, becoming fast friends and nearly falling in love (all while Toby's wife lies helpless just a few doors away). If this were the only version of Helena I'd have put the book away in disgust.<br />Fortunately, Helena's life is doled out chapter by chapter (alternating between current day and the past) and we get to know her intimately. We watch her suffer all of life's little and much larger hurts as she stumbles through life. Helena is easy to relate to as a chubby heartbroken youngster pulled ruthlessly away from her best friend Sam when her parents relocate from London to America. Her awkwardness and desire to fit in are realistically described and are often painfully funny. Eventually Helena finds her own niche in the world as she discovers her passion, bass guitar, and meets up with and becomes bandmates with Justin (an unlikely match since he's the school hunk and she's still chubby and thought of as a bit odd). The two begin a band called \\"Blue Idea\\" and become incredibly famous but Helena's life is filled with an impending sense of doom when Sam becomes ill. The band eventually breaks up and when Helena doesn't quite know what to do with herself and wallows in complete self-despair it is easy to sympathize with her pain and feelings of hopelessness.<br />Helena's playlist for the \\"The Plan\\" highlights the most important points in her life and once I started I found it extremely difficult to put the book down. \\"To Be Someone\\" is often painful to read (I dare you to get through this without wetting a few tissues) but it's very real and filled with life, emotion and humor. I'm nearly as jaded as Helena (but not nearly as famous!) and very few books move me to tears or laughter these days but this book involved me emotionally from beginning to end and I'm very glad I took the time to read it.current day and the past) and we get to know her intimately.

First, I must disagree with a previous review that stated this book stands on its own.  I didn't realize this was book three in an ongoing series and found it a little rough going.  Alanna had obviously been through a lot before this book and I continually felt like I had missed out on big important chunks of her past (especially her past relationships with others) and her knighthood.<br />In this book Alanna is a knight in a world where most tribes believe woman aren't meant to be a warrior (and how she became a knight? well, I still have no clue).  The story begins as Alanna, along with her feline friend (whom she can communicate with) and her man-at-arms are attacked by Hillmen.  Following the battle (of which Alanna and her crew are victorious) Alanna is forced to stay with the desert Bazhir tribe where her troubles begin in earnest. The local Shaman does not want Alanna around and causes her no end of trouble.  Eventually a battle leads to Alanna's new position as Shaman of the tribe and her days are spent tutoring three gifted youngsters, two of them girls (much to the tribe's dismay) in the ways of magic.<br />Further complicating things is her relationship (which is surprisingly sexual, though not explicit, for a book marked 7-9 grade!) with Prince Jon.  She sleeps with him nightly but as she spends more time with him comes to realize that he's a bit too spoiled (boy, is he ever!) and that she's not quite ready for the marriage he wants.  She's also most definitely not ready to birth him a few babies just yet!  Prince Jon is not pleased when she voices her opinion on their future together.  Soon after Alanna meets up with yet another romantic interest George, the King of Thieves, who I guess is an old pal who becomes oh-so-much more.  Finally, there's some trouble with Alanna's twin Thom who seems to be swaying over to the \\"darker side\\" of magic.<br />This is an okay book, as Pierce is a skilled world-builder, but I felt at a loss through the majority of the story and things didn't get moving until midway through.  I also never felt a connection to any of the many characters which is a shame because I typically enjoy this author's people and their humorous insights (Trickster's Choice & Circle of Magic: Sandry's Book are two I enjoyed thoroughly).  The Woman Who Rides Like A Man is very much a \\"middle of the series\\" type of book and should not be read independently of the others in this series.book, as Pierce is a skilled world-builder, but I felt at a loss through the majority of the story and things didn't get moving until midway through.

My just-about-to-turn-six year old little girl (and fellow chocaholic) adores this book.  We've read it so many times together that she knows each page by heart.<br />Lilly is a cute little mouse who decides to save her last Valentine's Day chocolate heart.  But where shall she put it?  Where will it remain safe and clean?  She searches throughout her home but nothing will do.  It's far too dusty under the bed, the picture frames are too narrow (the heart will surely fall off & get lost!), the bookshelves are too crammed with books.  Finally, Lilly decides the best place to keep the heart safe is inside her belly.  When she's finished enjoying her last treat she wonders aloud when Valentine's Day will come around again.<br />This is an adorable little hardback filled with charming drawings of Lilly's pastel world.  I disagree that the packaging will turn off older kids.  The light colored palette and lively drawings are exactly what attracted my daughter (well, that and the chocolate heart!).  Boy's, however, will probably steer clear of this one ~ I know my son runs when we pull this one out :)	2004-06-02
US	52186522	R1GFC1KFMYENUP	055371354X	745333509	Babyville	Books	3	1	3	N	N	What am I missing?!	I read Babyville as an abridged audiobook (only because an unabridged format was unavailable to me) and it wasn't the witty, sarcastic read I was expecting it to be.  And at times it was downright depressing and sometimes irritating.  What happened to the humor Green's previous books were lauded for?  Was it all cut out in this abridged version?  If so, that's a shame for both the author and myself!<br />This version of Babyville features the stories of three women all facing baby issues of one sort or another and whose lives intertwine in the most unexpected of ways.  Julia's story is first.  When the story opens Julia is a successful businesswoman who, at first glance, appears to be in a satisfying relationship with her long-time beau Mark.  But trouble simmers below the surface.  Julia and Mark's once passion-filled relationship has fallen into a rut.  Julia feels stifled, bored even, by her quiet life with Mark.  She's an outgoing city girl and Mark is a homebody.  She's comprised much to make a life with Mark and has decided that having a baby will fix everything wrong in their relationship.  She couldn't be more mistaken but that's beside the point because the two soon realize conceiving isn't quite as easy as they expected. Julia obsesses over becoming pregnant, ruining her business reputation and straining her already troubled relationship to the breaking point.  Julia's pain, frustration and misguided anger are realistic and dramatically written and Mark's tolerant attitude is almost pitiful.  It's easy to feel the pain of this couple and when the inevitable happens it's was quite a relief!<br />Next up is Maeve's story.  Maeve is another successful career gal but one who is desperate to avoid babies at all costs.  She has no interest in kids and intends to keep it that way.  When an out of the ordinary encounter with a handsome colleague leads to a one night stand that leaves her pregnant she immediately makes an appointment to have an abortion.  Everything changes when she tells the impregnator of her condition and realizes that she is not alone in this after all.  Maeve grows incredibly as a character and her relationship is the most satisfying of this trio.  Unfortunately, because so much is going on (what with the three separate stories and all) her story quickly ends and the focus shifts to Samantha (Sam).<br />Sam is happily married to her long-time love Chris and is expecting a baby when the book begins.  When her story rolls around she is a new mom intent on becoming the Best Mom Ever.  She spends her days cooking organic meals for baby George and neglecting her long-suffering (but always loving) husband.  Eventually she feels unappreciated and fat and contemplates having a lusty affair with a new friends' husband with near disastrous (and very embarrassing) results.  Initially, I really liked Sam and felt horrible for her as her depression continued to spiral out of control. But as her story progressed she came off as somewhat of a self-centered nitwit and I lost a huge chunk of respect for her character though she does redeem herself in the end (thankfully!)<br />As a working woman and a mother I could find a bit of myself in each of these women and I suspect many us can as well.  But, though their plights are realistic it is often difficult to like these women completely (at least in this version).  They come across as self-centered and shallow too often for my liking.  The men actually come off much more loving and tolerant than the gals, I'm afraid.<br />Another problem was the fact that this audio moves fast.  Just as we're getting to know the characters the storyline switches focus to an entirely different set of people with different \\"baby\\" issues.  Is it the abridged format or just the way the book was written?  I guess I'll never know because I don't feel inclined to read the unabridged version after this experience.g changes when she tells the impregnator of her condition and realizes that she is not alone in this after all.

I am reviewing the CD version of the recording of a Stephen King live appearance.  Included is Stephen King's darkly comical introduction to the live audience followed by his reading of \\"LT's Theory of Pets\\". Unfortunately, the question and answer session promised by King in his intro. is missing in this CD version.  I've listened to this disk several times now and it never fails to entertainment and elicit a few laughs from me (even when I'm in a foul mood). It's actually become somewhat of a \\"mind clearer\\" when I'm between books and King's reading of the tale (and his undeniably Maine accent) is always comforting when I'm over-stressed.<br />In his introduction King states that LT's Theory of Pets was initially going to be a story \\"that would be sorta funny\\" (the way many of his stories start out, he claims) and sort of rude.  He wasn't kidding.  Much of the humor here is of the crude, potty variety but some of the funniest moments are observations of typical day to day annoyances that most of us can cop to feeling at one time or another (especially if you've ever lived with another person for any length of time).  It's also a look at the disintegration of a marriage which isn't quite so funny.<br />LT's loves to tell the story of how his marriage woes all began with the damn animals.  Lulubell, LT's more than slightly loopy wife (and with a name like Lulubell what else could you expect?!), gifted LT with a little dog named Frank on their first wedding anniversary.  And wouldn't you know it; Frank took an instant dislike to LT while simply adoring Lulubell.  LT then decides to buy Lulubell a gorgeous Siamese cat named Lucy who, of course, bonds with LT and despises Lulubell.  Thus begins the unfixable rift in their relationship that continues to get wider as time passes.  Eventually LT returns home from work to find a Dear John note taped to the fridge.  Frank and Lulu are long gone and though LT makes light of things and pokes great fun at Lulubell while retelling his story there is a sense of despair lurking deep down within him at her mysterious disappearance.  When a year goes by with no contact from Lulubell LT fears she may have been a victim of an axe murderer.<br />The price may be a tad too much for what equals about an hour's worth of listening time if you're not a big fan of King's voice (or his stories, for that matter) but for me it was worth every cent (though I am knocking off a point for the missing Q&amp;A!).g his story there is a sense of despair lurking deep down within him at her mysterious disappearance.

Sam Starrett, in my book, had morphed from a sexy hero type into a Class A jerk, a bad boyfriend, a terrible husband, a lousy father and an all around sad sack.  Fortunately (as it turns out) my local book reading friends chose this as a reading selection and I forced myself to begin what I assumed would be an irritating read.<br />Gone Too Far is a bit different in format than the previous books in the \\"Troubleshooter\\" series which were very much action/adventure romances and I've seen a few complaints that the beginning was too slow but this wasn't the case for me.  It had been months since I read the last book in this series but I quickly fell back into the flow of things and was immediately hooked by the gripping characterization and the suspenseful plot line.  The story opens as Sam is headed to his estranged wife Mary Lou's home to claim the signed divorce papers she promised him three weeks earlier.  Sam finds the divorce papers alright but he also finds a dead body that may or may not be Mary Lou's and their young daughter Haley is missing.  Sam, of course, becomes prime suspect #1.<br />Meanwhile Alyssa is sent to detain Sam and bring him in for questioning.  I'm still not clear exactly why this happened but hey it gets them together (finally) so who am I to complain?  Sam and Alyssa go on a search for the missing (and possibly dead) Mary Lou and Haley and learn a whole lot about each other in between arguments and fighting off their undeniable attraction to one another.  Brockmann, in flashback and dialogue, allows the reader an in-depth look into Sam's troubled past and explains away much of his bad and difficult to understand behavior in previous books.  Alyssa, always a cold and steely-type comes across as more human in this book as well. And it's about darn time too!  Before long I found myself, if not liking them wholeheartedly, at least rooting for them to work things out once and for all.<br />Rounding out the story is a multitude of subplots (too many if you ask me) all competing for attention.  There's Sam's childhood memories, the World War II flashback story between a white female pilot and the black man she falls in love with, there's Max and Gina's compelling, pain filled on-going love story, Team Sixteen's former leader Tom Paoletti is accused of aiding terrorists and his sweetheart of a wife is . . . well it goes on and on and it all gets to be a tad too much to keep track of after awhile.  This book would've been a much \\"cleaner\\" read if the author hadn't crammed in so many various (but interesting) plot lines into one book.<br />Though Sam and Alyssa aren't always easy people to like their story is compelling, passionate and filled with intense emotion.  I can't say this about most of the books I've been reading this year and am very thankful to my reading friends for \\"forcing\\" me to read this one!ound myself, if not liking them wholeheartedly, at least rooting for them to work things out once and for all.<br />Rounding out the story is a multitude of subplots (too many if you ask me) all competing for attention.

I listened to this as an unabridged audiobook and if it weren't for the fact that I was trapped in a car with no other form of entertainment to be found I more than likely would've given up on this one mid-way through.  The characters were too blah to hold my attention and their attraction to each other just didn't come alive for me.<br />It turns out this story is the third in a series but it easily stands alone since its plot isn't exactly complicated.  Octavia Brightwell is relatively new to Eclipse Bay and runs a successful art gallery.  She arrived in Eclipse Bay to soothe the rift between the Madison &amp; Harte families that her dear departed aunt caused years earlier.  Once Octavia realizes the feud has been mended without her help she decides it's time to leave Eclipse Bay.  She's also desperate to get away from gorgeous, heartbreaker Nick Harte who continually pesters her for a date. When she finally makes up her mind to high-tail it out of town she agrees to the date with Nick (don't ask).  They soon become romantically entangled and banter back and forth denying their true feelings.  Before long the two find themselves partners in the search for a valuable missing painting and, well, I bet you can figure out the rest . . .<br />These two are very much stock characters.  We have Nick who lost the love of his life years earlier and has never allowed himself to fall in love again (and has a reputation for loving `em and leaving `em before the night is over) and then we have the \\"free spirit\\" Octavia who sort of floats through life and avoids romantic entanglements.  Stock characters are all fine and good when they're written with depth and emotion but these two were just flat out bland and their relationship lacked any sort of spark.  Nick also has an annoying habit of referring to Octavia as a \\"fairy queen\\" that made me cringe every time he uttered the words.<br /><br />There are also pop-up appearances by characters who I only guess starred in previous books.  They add a little to the story but their visits did not convince me that I need to search for the previous books in this series.  There are also far too many over the top weird/quirky/cult-y/odd speaking secondary characters populating this story to be believed.<br />The few bits of fun banter and Nick's enjoyable little boy Carson are about all that I'll be remembering about \\"Summer In Eclipse Bay\\" once I finish writing this review.oks.

Laymon takes twisted delight in creating Melvin, a junk food ingesting geek with an all consuming desire to bring back a woman from the dead.  He uses old tomes with recipes/spells to bring the dead back to life but never truly believes it'll work (we surely would've heard about it on the news if were possible, wouldn't we?!).  Somehow his most recent *recipe* works and then the fun begins as he's unprepared to deal with the consequences.  It's quite entertaining in a morbid, dark-humor kind of way.<br />Vicki was unfortunate enough to witness Melvin's first attempt at resurrection when they were teens at the same high school and has horrible nightmares ever since.  Now she's a doctor and headed back to her home town and decides (quite ridiculously, if you ask me) to visit Melvin (he owns the local gas station) and get it out of the way.  Melvin always liked Vicki because she was the only person who was nice to him as a teen.  Now that Vicki is all grown up Melvin likes Vicki a whole lot more and develops an unhealthy obsession and starts some serious stalker-like behavior.<br />Vicki and her friend Ace decide the only way to end Melvin's obsession with Vicki is to shatter the illusion.  So these two brainiacs concoct a plan where Vicki will \\"date\\" Melvin thus shattering his dreams of the perfect \\"dream girl\\" once he realizes Vicki isn't entirely inaccessible to him.  Okaaaaay!  This, of course, only allows Melvin closer access to her life and causes more trouble (and more grossities!)  I found this book extremely funny and was especially amused at all of the perverted men populating the story.  The thing that cracked me up the most was the \\"resurrected\\" people who all came back as raving sex fiends.  Eyeballs gouged out?  Hands burned to a crisp?  Half a noggin' gone a-missing?  Fear not, one can still get excited and easily grab the nearest breast with nearly a fumble!<br />For those who care about such things be warned that this book would've benefited by another round of the red pen.  See  page 109 for example.  Two characters are in the same room talking about trivial things like biting hands and such when in the next sentence (not chapter) they're suddenly in separate rooms and it seems like we've missed a huge section of naughty goings-on.  Hey, I want to know why all of the good stuff went missing!  It was disconcerting and jarred me right out of the story but that's the nitpicky reviewer in me (sorry, it's hard to shut off).<br />Anyway, this was my first Laymon but definitely not my last!uch things be warned that this book would've benefited by another round of the red pen.

Forgive me if I spell names incorrectly. I listened to the unabridged audio version of this story.<br />The book centers around four young outcasts named Daja (a Trader), Briar (a street thief), Sandry (a noble) & Tris (a commoner). All, for one reason or another, are basically on their own and have experienced far too much pain and disappointment in their young lives.  They're unwanted, unloved, and unable to fit in. A mysterious man named \\"Niko\\" discovers and delivers each of them to a place called \\"Winding Circle Temple\\" where, once again, none of them are quite able to fit in with the other residents. They are eventually separated from the other (bratty and snooty, if you ask me) kids living at Winding Circle and are sent off to \\"Discipline\\", a cabin where they're pretty much isolated from the other residents at Winding Circle.<br />While at \\"Discipline\\" each discovers a previously untapped talent for magic.  They spend their days learning to develop their own particular talents and becoming an unlikely group of close-knit friends.  Eventually their bond and talents are put to the test as they must use their newly developed powers of meditation and concentration to face a natural disaster.<br />Pierce brings her world alive with vivid imagery and well described settings and the story moves along at brisk clip but I would have enjoyed it more had it been just a mite longer.  Though the book is titled \\"Sandry's Book\\" it was as much about Briar, Tris and Daja as it was about Sandry.  Though all of these characters come to life in this production the focus switches all too often between them (and not always smoothly) and their individual stories are spread a bit too thin for my liking (I was also confused at times as to which child was currently speaking which didn't help matters).  Tamora Pierce serves as the narrator for the piece along with a full cast of actors supporting her.  Pierce's narration comes across as a bit bland and monotonous when compared with the vivacious children but despite it all I found myself anxious to hear how it all turned out.<br />The story has humor, the kids are survivors both wise and emotional and I'm anxious to check out the other books in the series to learn more about prickly, guarded Tris, kind-hearted Sandry, plucky Briar and Daja (I can't wait to see where her interesting version of magic leads).vivacious children but despite it all I found myself anxious to hear how it all turned out.<br />The story has humor, the kids are survivors both wise and emotional and I'm anxious to check out the other books in the series to learn more about prickly, guarded Tris, kind-hearted Sandry, plucky Briar and Daja (I can't wait to see where her interesting version of magic leads).	2004-05-03

I read this book as an unabridged audiobook not realizing I was diving headfirst into a long running series.  Despite my complete lack of knowledge about the previous five books events my enjoyment of the book wasn't lessoned by bouts of confusion which says a lot for the talent of the author.  Yeah, there were a few gaps here and there but nothing I couldn't get past or figure out by continuing to read along.<br />Kit Rodriquez is a young wizard (as I'm sure most of you know), who along with his talking dog Ponch, are attempting to figure out why it is taking so long for a potential wizard to complete his Ordeal (something that must be done, apparently, before he can become a full blown wizard).  As they investigate and eventually enter the boys' mind, Kit learns that Darryl is autistic and witness shocking moments of violence upon the young defenseless boy that are perpetrated by The Lone Power.  Both Kit and Ponch, especially, are shocked and determined to reach the boy, even if it means entering strange and dangerous worlds inside Darryl's mind.<br />Kit's best friend and usual partner in wizardry, Nita, has her own set of troubles.  The death of her beloved mother has sent her family members and herself into a deep depression.  Dad and Nita's sister are having a difficult time getting out of bed and it's up to Nita to keep them moving through life.  It's so easy and tempting to drown in sadness, as Nita acknowledges, but she's taken it upon herself to keep her remaining family intact.  As if that weren't more than enough to bear, she's also been plagued by some very odd dreams involving clowns.  Eventually her dreams get her involved with Kit's current dilemma with The Lone Power and Darryl.<br />This book was great from beginning to end.  The plot was interesting and it was a tremendously emotional read.  Nita's grief and efforts to keep plodding through life with the glimmer that maybe someday things wouldn't hurt quite so much were written with realism.  Even Ponch, the dog, has some surprisingly emotional revelations and reactions to the things he's seeing.  Kit's a plucky young character who is easy to like but it's strong and insightful Nita's story that will stick with me for some time to come.  There's also enough humor mixed in to prevent the story from becoming overly gloomy.  I particularly enjoyed Ponce's take on things and Kit's interactions with a prickly DVD player and an antagonistic TV.<br />I'm definitely going to locate the other books in the series to catch up on what I've missed.n Ponch, the dog, has some surprisingly emotional revelations and reactions to the things he's seeing.

It rates about a four for me for keeping me entertained while on my long drive to work. My drifty mind wandered only a few times.<br />The story reminds me very much of something Dean Koontz could've cooked up (I love the way the Koontz writes even when he gets over-the-top silly and meanders off into pages and pages of mind numbing description). This book is fast paced (this author apparently doesn't share Koontz's proclivity for longwindyness) and tells a story of a boy and his dog infected with a cancer, gun-shot wound, burnt to a crisp curing, form of nano-technology. Don't ask. My pea brain can't comprehend it. Anyway, one of the scientists who worked on this technology is also infected with these nano-critters. But he went and infected himself with the bad kind (duh!) and instead of fixing whatever ails him they make him break out with big tumorous lesions and whomever he touches dies of plague-like symptoms. Why? Ya got me. Plague-man is desperately searching for the boy and his dog because he believes their blood will cure him (boy, dog and their mom are hiding). Along the way he touches a few people and grossness occurs. Scully, Mulder and The Smoking Man make a few appearances but this story doesn't bring them to life in any exceptional way and it lacked Mulder's morbid sense of humor (the book would've rated much higher if these characters came alive a bit more). Overall it was interesting, a little icky and very sad at times reminding me of a classic X-Files episode without the Mulderisms.	2004-04-01

I love Minnie and Moo. Who could resist a cream puff addicted cow? Not me. Anyway, like the other books in the \\"Minnie and Moo\\" universe this is another story filled with silly fun and is quirkily different from most Thanksgiving stories. It's Thanksgiving and bovines Minnie and Moo are relaxing beneath a tree sipping away on hot cocoa and nibbling on cream puffs when thirty-six frantic turkeys beg need of their help. It's Thanksgiving and Mrs. Farmer's cousins are about for a visit. The turkeys, being turkeys, fear for their lives! Minnie and Moo hide the tribe of turkeys in the tree and settle in to finish their snack when they're accosted by a rather rude rooster and his flock of chickens who demand help. They're next in line in the food chain, you see. Before you know it Minnie and Moo have quite the zoo hidden within the tree.

The first story \\"The Man In The Black Suit\\" tells a dark edged tale laced with grief and centers around a young boy and his fear of losing his Mom. Out fishing one day a boy has a run-in with the devil who attempts to take advantage of his fear. It manages to be creepy, funny, and heartbreaking and the characters come to vivid life. This is a story I'll be rereading before passing along.<br />Next up is &quot;All That You Love Will Be Carried Away&quot; about a suicidal traveling salesman with a quirky habit of collecting little snippets of bathroom graffiti in a notebook. As he contemplates suicide and the trauma it (and the discovery of his odd collection) will have on his wife and young daughter (he has no clue . . .) he reviews his favorites for what may or may not be the last time. This was a downright gloomy story filled with despair and near hopelessness about a lonely life spent on the road. There's an itsy bitsy glimmer of hope at the very end and the emotion felt very real but I wish I hadn't \\"read\\" this one in such an intimate format. I can deal with gloominess, darkness and all the grossness you can splatter at me but a suicidal father is something I never, ever wish to read about if I can avoid it.<br />\\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" takes a step back in time. It's all about a gang of bank robbers, one who is gravely wounded, running from the law. I'm not a big fan of this sort of thing but King's writing voice managed to hold my attention.

Am I jaded? Too easily bored? Tempted too easily by the lure of the tv? Probably. Having already seen the movie based upon this novel I knew what I was getting into when I turned the first page. A very funny, somewhat jaded, slightly over-the-top look at the modern girls' search for love. I figured I'd turn a few pages before becoming bored or distracted but was surprised when I quickly polished off 70 pages before nodding away to dreamland (from exhaustion not boredom). I found Bridget's lack of control when it came to nearly everything quite amusing and her constant (but never overwhelming) remorse realistic. She keeps on plugging away despite her setbacks and always maintains a wicked sense of snark that you've gotta love. Yeah, she's more than a little self-absorbed but I still loved her.<br />Some fave bits:<br />When Bridget ponders the weirdness of why one must apply mascara with mouth open, making me feel not-quite-so-odd for doing the same. It's these silly little comments on the mundane that kept me turning the pages.<br />Love Bridget's daily tallying up of her vices. This one is my favorite though:<br />Pg. 77 9st, alcohol units 5 (disgrace: urine of Satan), cigarettes 14 (weed of Satan - will give up on birthday)<br />Another favorite of mine (possible because I don't know the first thing about throwing a successful diner party) was her famous dinner party where she agonized over making the perfect. \\"Realize after all effort and expense have served my guests: blue soup, omelet, marmalade.\\"<br />A great read.

I've read a lot of ugly things in my life but this book touches on a deeper level because of this young child's age and the horrors she endures daily in her truly &quot;cruddy&quot; life. If it weren't so darned sad when thought about it'd be almost funny. Wish this book had been around when I was 14 or so and my own life may not have looked quite so bleak to me after having read it. The author has a knack for digging into an adolescent's mind and really brings that painful period of time of young adulthood (those ugly years when one is 13 - 17) alive in a brilliantly, devastating way.<br />The cruelties continue to the very last page. Somehow I wasn't left feeling depressed but actually relieved at the eventual outcome. I can't say it was an altogether enjoyable reading experience, although I did laugh out loud a few times, but I sure couldn't stop turning the pages. The illustrations completely capture the feel of the book. Recommended to the strong of stomach.	2004-04-01

This is a book meant to be read in one sitting, preferably on a dark dreary night while the wind is howling through all of the cracks &amp; crevices of old windows. Though I have the old, drafty windows, unfortunately, I no longer have the luxury of reading anything in one sitting and was forced to settle for half hour reading spurts whenever I could steal away from the various noises (kids fighting, husband yapping, tv blaring) residing in my home. Despite the pick-up and put-down method of my reading I was able to fall into the book all over again each time I began anew. This really says something about the story considering I'm unable to get through 3 out of 4 books I read lately. Like the previous Graham Joyce book I read \\"The Tooth Fairy\\", the characters in Dark Sister are realistic, imperfect people with many flaws. No one is perfect through and through.<br />Maggie is an engrossing character caught in a stifling marriage. She's a stay-at-home mom who longs for a little more than keeping house (and getting criticized by husband Alex when things are not up to his standards). Alex, an insecure turd, is the type who would lock her in a tower and throw away the key if he could get away with it and refuses to allow her to return to school. When the not-so-happy couple discover an old journal filled with herbal lore Maggie becomes a little obsessed with learning its secrets. As Maggie delves deeper into the world of magic and makes two new friends (a lonely herbalist and an eccentric, crusty old lady) who become part of her journey, her marriage continues to go down the tubes. I found Maggie's magical discoveries quite interesting but it's the increasing destruction of her family life that adds an emotionally grueling level to the story.<br />Maggie is a much more sympathetic character than Alex the a-hole but she also has her share of faults as well (but, hmmm, are they all her fault?). In anger, she says a few well deserved horribly awful things to Alex but I cringed because her young children were listening (and she knew it). She also forgets her responsibilities (i.e., her children) one time too many when her other world begins to consume her and she doesn't seem overly bothered by the fact. These missteps added to the realism of her character. I'm so sick of flawless characters and these people, even when unlikable, were a smack of reality and a nice change of pace.<br />Another thing I liked was the depiction of Maggie's youngest son. He looks like a cherubic angel but acts like a real kid. He's a genuine, tantrum throwing brat who reacts to the increasing turmoil within his family with fear and fits. I found this very sad and yet another eloquently written layer of the story.<br />As the story progresses and Maggie's dabbling with magic has some eye-opening results (love the revenge on Alex) but also awakens her \\"dark sister\\" and the story becomes even more intense.

It documents the process of creating the color story. How it's conceived, marketed, sold, ect. and reveals many interesting insider details about the color stories and the mis-truth's reported by popular beauty magazines. It also goes back in time to the conception of the beauty industry telling the beginnings of the Estee Lauder empire and walks you through a Mary Kay conference (found this pretty amusing). At times the detail becomes repetitive and I did a bit of skimming but overall it was an interesting little read.	2004-04-01

I read the abridged audiobook version and may have missed some important character motivation/nuances.  I am reviewing the ABRIDGED version because this is the version I read in its entirety.  First off the writing is very lyrical and gorgeous in spots but someone save me from spineless ninny heroine's easily wooed with pretty words and heated glances and selfish, thoughtless nincompoop love interests.<br /><br />I'd never read Rosamunde Pilcher before this and am glad I had the opportunity to try her work. This book was read by Kate Burton who does an amazingly beautiful job with the Irish brogue and made listening to the story a real pleasure. Unfortuntately, I had many \\"issues\\" with the book's heroine Victoria but I tend to prefer the type of heroines who have a backbone and Victoria was way too passive for my taste. Her innocence and kind-hearted acceptance of Oliver's (the love interest) horrendous behavior and attitude annoyed the heck out of me but it was somewhat understandable considering her need for love and connection.  Still, I won't be actively searching out the unabridged version of this one.	2004-04-01

We chose it because the premise sounded like a lot of fun in the write up we read during our last meeting. The execution of that premise, however, was much less enjoyable than the glowing review it received in an industry mag.<br />Alyssa's best friend Mindy is getting married but Mindy doesn't trust her husband-to-be to remain faithful during his bachelor party (her previous fianc&eacute; cheated on her during his bachelor party) and asks Alyssa to infiltrate the party disguised as a stripper (Alyssa's a dancer and knows how to shake her thang). During the party Alyssa drinks some booze laced punch and lets loose. Cooper, the best man and a straight-laced type, removes Alyssa from the party (letting her sleep it off in his den) when she throws her bra in his face. When Alyssa awakens she decides to have a wild a night of sex with Cooper, throwing her virginity and all common sense to the wind . . .<br />Cooper is smitten with the smart-mouthed stripper who has just given him the best sex of his life and intends to get to know her a whole lot better but it seems she's run away. He meets her again, of course, at the wedding the next day and recognizes her even though she no longer wears a black wig, stripper makeup and is acting all shy and innocent. But before he can have at her again she's on the run back home to San Francisco.<br />The setup is cute (if you can suspend your disbelief enough to have some fun with it) but from here little things begin to drive me over the edge.<br />Alyssa is nauseatingly over-the-top sweet. She meets a kid on a plane who whines that she wants a pony for Christmas and doesn't believe in Santa because he refuses to deliver her one. When Alyssa learns from the mom that she's struggling to make ends meet Alyssa (whose family is loaded) agrees to buy her one so she'll continue to believe in magic. I swear, I couldn't make this stuff up. She dotes on her grandfather (which is kind of sweet) and remains a virgin at 24?! Why remain virginal to throw it away on a one night fling? This girl is described as a gorgeous, wild, free-spirit but has never seen a man's anatomy up close? Sorry, I'm not buyin' it.<br />Anyway, Cooper is so desperate to have a repeat of the \\"greatest sex in his life\\" that he nearly becomes all stalker-like. He interrogates the other strippers until they reveal private info. that leads him to Alyssa. He then boards a plane and follows her to San Francisco, leaving his important business in the hands of his partner, when he locates her and spies on her while she dances at her place of business.<br />All of this adds up to a book more frustrating than funny.sweet) and remains a virgin at 24?!

I enjoyed this book in the same fashion I enjoy the series as a light-hearted guilty pleasure.  The writing veers to the slightly cheesy \\"Fear not!\\" \\"The witches must be destroyed!\\" but then again so does the dialogue and on the show ;)<br />Fortunately the author also pokes fun of the cheesier aspects of the series with gems such as:<br />Bad guy: \\"You may address me as Master.\\"<br />Piper: \\"Master of what?

It's a character driven coming of age story about three young boys growing up in apparent normalcy. But underneath the veneer of normalcy simmers unexpected moments of darkness and danger. As the boy's deal with life's many pitfalls -- growing up too smart, too dumb, too mediocre -- lurking in the shadows is a vicious tooth fairy which only one of the boy's (Sam) can see.<br />This tooth fairy is not the sweet version of childhood dreams but a nightmarish razor toothed, potty mouthed, mischievous apparition and it's not at all pleased that Sam can see it. As Sam grows, the tooth fairy continues to show up unexpectedly and begins to change its form, becoming a chilling sexual thing that teases and taunts and awakens odd feelings in Sam. Despite Sam's fear of the tooth fairy the two have a weird sort of connection.<br />This was most definitely a book that was anything but the \\"same-old, same-old\\" and I never could figure out quite where it was going next which is what I enjoyed so much about the book. The blend of the ordinary and the \\"weird\\" was seamless. Sam was a well developed, realistic character and watching him mature and grow was fascinating and I'm still pondering over the question \\"was it all in his imagination?\\" I'd like to think<br />it wasn't.<br />Overall a very creepy, touching, and perfectly bizarre book.	2004-04-01

It was much more interesting upon the first reading and didn't hold my attention all that well the 2nd time around. It tells the story of Anna, a young woman, who returns &quot;home&quot; reluctantly when she catches her lover in bed with another woman. Anna and her aunt were once close but betrayal and bad feelings have kept them at a distance. Anna is talked into going to work at the family restaurant and discovers new friends, a new love interest (in a reclusive, scarred man) and puts her past to rest.

US	52186522	RRFL9J1TVGNH6	1931081727	764791716	The Devil You Know	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Different but still great!	Initially I was disappointed to learn that Poppy Z. Brite, one of my all-time favorite writers, had decided to leave her gothic fantasy world of New Orlean's far behind in exchange for a toned down look at life from the point of view of the regular folks inhabiting New Orleans (mostly gay, hard-working cooks). I really enjoyed those dark, graphically violent books ~ especially Exquisite Corpse (hmmm, what does that say about me?!). But once I began this book I found myself enjoying her new style which is much less \\"purple\\" in its prose and contains a heavy does of unexpected wit and very little of the supernatural (it's still there in a few stories but much less the focus).<br />The stories contained within this book concentrate more on the people (none of whom are vampires) and the local color of New Orleans and they're all very interesting and slightly \\"odd\\" in their own way.<br />I even enjoyed \\"Nothing of Him That Doth Fade\\" which appears to be disliked by many readers. Yeah, it's bleak and horribly sad but that's the point. It paints a realistic portrait of a lovely love affair gone painfully bad. Love is like that sometimes. \\"Pansu\\" is a favorite of mine. It's bizarre and an oh-so-very-funny take on possession and exorcism. I thoroughly enjoyed the stories featuring coroner Dr. Brite (the last, about a child, was tough for me to read at times but worth the effort in the end) and I'm anxiously awaiting Poppy's next novel \\"Liquor\\" (many of the stories here feature characters from that upcoming novel). The only story that left me cold was the one set in the Matrix universe \\"System Freeze\\". I'm not a super huge fan of the Matrix and I'm sure that explains my lack of enthusiasm for this story. It was just an \\"eh\\" read for me ~ the details have already flown completely out of my head. \\"Burn Baby Burn\\" set in the \\"Hellboy\\" universe worked much better for me.<br />Make sure you're not hungry before starting the stories because most contain delectable descriptions of New Orleans cuisine.ew Orleans cuisine.	2004-04-01

I purposely didn't read the back blurb and as such wasn't sure what to expect when I began the book (just had some vague memory of positive comments about the story) and I was continually surprised by the plot twists and turns. It's been far too long since I've read something that was pleasant through and through. I enjoyed Sophie's go with the flow attitude (can't say as I'd be nearly as accepting and pleasant as she initially was with her transformation!) and her quirky sense of humor. Howl, the cad, was a great character. Very selfish and self-centered and almost childishly funny at times, he managed to worm his way into my good graces by giving Michael & Sophie a home without conditions or questions.	2004-04-01

The underlying story was interesting enough for me to want to continue turning the pages while I often became frustrated at Cora's rambling style of telling the story and her lengthy descriptions of everything surrounding her. Some details were interesting (gardening) while others made me smile (especially those of her friends sex lives) but many were just plain dull. This tidbit, taken from a scene where Cora is describing herself, could just as well describe the author's method of telling her story: \\"When he (Cora's husband) told me a story I made him repeat himself. When he baptized an infant I asked him to describe the christening dress.\\" (...)Guess this book disturbed me on a level that I wasn't aware of! And, here I thought I was too jaded to be bothered by a story.	2004-04-01

This unabridged audiobook had my attention, lost it, gained it backed and would then lose it again. Could be my distracted mind or it could be that it was just wasn't an interesting mystery? That said, there were several things to like. The protagonist Jarrod, an accomplished glassblower, was enjoyable ~ he's this regular guy with a very interesting (to me) profession who finds himself accosted by dangerous types and suddenly smack dab in the middle of mystery concerning a missing video cassette tape. His character and that of his off beat co-workers and surrounding support system were interesting and the detailed look into the world of professional glassblowing was fascinating. Unfortunately, the facts surrounding the missing tape and the sleuthing that follows to discover what the tape contains just didn't hold my attention and I repeatedly found myself drifting off into my own little world and having to rewind the tape during these sections. Maybe a true mystery aficionado would appreciate this one more than I.	2004-04-01

There is a sad undertone to the whole story and an underlying thread of darkness , cruelty and the grotesque (the cow, the cow!). Very original and imaginative.

I recently listened to the ABRIDGED version of another X-Files novelization called Antibodies and enjoyed it quite a bit (especially the smart dog bits). The ABRIDGED version of Ruins, though, just couldn't hold my attention for any length of time and I found myself doing a lot of rewinding when my mind would drift away. Could be the story was a dud or it could be my frame of mind.  Either way I won't be re-reading this again and will be passing it along sooner rather than later.<br />The story is about an archeological dig gone bad. Throw in an ancient curse, a search for a missing archeologist, possible human sacrifice (yikes!), then add some bad guy standbys like a drug dealer and the leader of a revolution and sprinkle it with bits of Scully and Mulder and you have yourself a story that falls to Ruins (at least for me). I'm sure it'll appeal to folks interested in archeology (there's lots of techie jargon tossed about), super die-hard X-Philes, and fans of Mitch Pilleggi, AKA Agent Skinner who does a decent job of narrating the story excepting a few bits where his tone takes a turn toward the monotonous.	2004-04-01

I read most of the early VC Andrews novels and enjoyed them through and through even when they started to become repetive but, sadly, I couldn't bring myself to finish this one. The story is thoroughly unappealing on all levels. Where shall I begin? The child-like writing? The unlikable and unrealistic teens? The forced diaper wearing? The information dumps that defy all logic? Need I continue? I think not . .	2004-04-01

Marcus was a peculiar, wonderful boy with a huge burden on his shoulders and I really enjoyed watching him become a stronger, confident person. Will was also great ~ I loved the fact that he was a such a self-centered jerk and completely content to remain that way. No guilt, no remorse, no commitments. Until he meets Marcus, that is. Their relationship was laugh out loud funny and so very believable. I had a very difficult time putting this book down (to do things like go to work and care for the kids).	2004-04-01

Gone for Good had me interested from the first page to the last which is quite an accomplishment for me, the all-too-easily bored. I'm not a huge mystery fan and, to be honest, was somewhat dreading having to read this story for my suspense group because it contained so many pages (anything over 300 scares me). But it was terrific! I never knew where the plot was going to take me next and the characters were very well fleshed out and interesting and I truly enjoyed the glimpse into the world of a famous Yoga instructor (Yoga is my second addiction after books). A big draw for me was the heartrending emotionalism weaved within the story; I came close to tears on many occasions. This is a great book if you like some heart along with your suspense.	2004-04-01

Having recently read two very lackluster &quot;chick-lit&quot; type books this story was a refreshing change of pace. There was no bitterness, no over the top shenanagins, no ridiculous situations and no 20 or 30-something nitwit heroine.<br />Instead the story is told from a happily married 60-ish heroine (Caroline) whose life is turned upside down when she receives two phone calls simultaneously from hysterical woman. One is her daughter, Kay, who is crying tears of joy because she's become engaged to the catch of the century and the other is from her sister Taffy whose husband just ran off with a very younger woman. Taffy &amp; her nasty little dog Stamp temporarily move in with Caroline and Tom while she decides what to do with the rest of her life. Caroline is less than thrilled with the fact that her daughter is marrying into such a wealthy family especially when she learns that they intend to invite 900 guest. Poor Caroline sees her retirement plans flying out the window. This story is about life's little (and bigger) bumps and all of the interwining relationships.<br />I also really enjoyed the way the author incorporated dance into the story ~ it read like it was her true passion and added a lot of depth to Caroline, Taffy &amp; George. There are many touching moments and wise observations about love, romance and marriage. The characters were all terrific and came alive for me and I hated to let them go when the book ended (something I rarely say about a book these days!). At times I wanted to shake some sense into Kay and felt like she was totally insensitive and selfish but it turns out she's only human (and really not so bad in the end) just the rest of the folks in this book . I smiled and my eyes teared up quite a bit while reading this and I'm adding this author's other books to my wishlist when I find a few spare minutes. My only complaint? This book could've been longer as I felt it all ended too quickly but maybe that's just because I enjoyed it so much.mplaint?

The stories were interesting little slice of life pieces laced with humor and sorrow. It was a very quick read for me and I'm a terribly slow reader.<br />I clicked with Jane immediately when she's first introduced as a witty and observant teenager. When she ponders, \\"Why is everything I want to know wrong?\\" I had to laugh out loud because, being the nosey sort that I am, I've asked this question myself numerous times. Each story took an interesting look at relationships and even though Jane runs in a world much different than the one I inhabit, I enjoyed watching her mature and stumble her way through all sorts of different relationships (family, friends, lovers) and career woes. Her bluntness and wicked sense of humor kept me turning the pages even when she embarked on the hopeless romance (that gave me a bad case of the creeps) found in the chapter entitled \\"My Old Man\\". I've read a review or two complaining about the last chapter but I enjoyed it, even as it exasperated me and tried my patience! I felt it brought the book to a pleasant, uplifting conclusion and it felt very true to life.	2004-04-01

The weather, for me at least, has never been so wildly dangerous.<br />The writer literally throws you into the story with very little in the way of back story or introduction and, initially, this was a bit of a stumbling block for me of the limited patience and very few working brain cells.

This technique of writing and the lack of shorter chapters to break things up often brought the pace of the story to a screeching halt for me and it took a bit of an effort to continue turning the pages on more than one occasion.<br />Fortunately, after the bumpy beginning things began to move along at a faster clip (this may stem more from the fact that I just decided to accept the storytelling method and began to expect the abrupt jumps back to the past). Joanne is a Weather Warden and possesses the power to control the weather. When the book begins she's on the run from both the weather (which is verrry frightening when it decides to turn on you!) and wardens who will end her life once they discover she has been poisoned some sort of magical demon mark. She's desperately searching for her missing uber-powerful friend Lewis who apparently stole three djinn, which is a major offense as djinn apparently help Warden's become even more powerful. What follows is a magical road-trip filled with one adventure after another and lots of hunky men (wish I lived in Joanne's universe!). It was a decent start to the series and intrigued me enough to want to pick up the next book but I can't say with any honesty that I'll be remembering the details of Ill Wind when the next book comes out.	2004-03-31

What these stories all have in common is a well developed sense of dread and/or despair and general unease whether the tale is dealing with paranormal elements or just flat out human evil. I didn't care for &quot;Cerberus&quot; or the story that followed it &quot;The Beautiful Children&quot; because the they just didn't grab me. &quot;These Are Ghost Stories&quot; with its dreamlike style couldn't hold me long enough and I ended up skimming most of it. But the others were dread-filled morsels that I gladly devoured. &quot;The Last Ferry&quot; was hands-down my favorite and kept me anxiously turning the pages wondering exactly where the protagonist was headed and for what reason. The ending threw me for a loop and haunted me in a way few stories do. &quot;Letters&quot; was another thoroughly enjoyable tale that makes one stop and think. Was the letter writer simply mad or living a bizarre, surreal existence? Whatever the answer the story was a nice blend of bland realism and weirdness.	2004-03-31

I started with #8 (Hard Eight), recently finished up #7 (Seven Up) and the latest listen has been Hot Six.  Reading these backwards has been an eye-opening experience and I'm now able to pinpoint exactly where things began to become repetitive for me as a reader (the very beginning of book #7, for those interested).<br />Hot Six has all of the wit and the fun its two follow-ups lack.  Stephanie's car blow ups are still funny, the tension between Stephanie, Ranger and Joe is starting to wear thin but still shows moments of spark and the one-liners are abundant and are grin-worthy.  In Hot Six things are just beginning to get that \\"same-old, same-old\\" feeling about them.<br />This time around Stephanie is on the hunt for fellow bounty hunter and lust interest, Ranger, who is a suspect in a murder case.  Stephanie doesn't have a chance of catching Ranger and she knows it but she takes on the assignment anyway.  Ranger soon visits her in the wee hours of the night and asks for her assistance in helping him prove his innocence.  Agreeing to this, of course, only gets bumbling Stephanie into trouble with some very shady characters.  As if that weren't enough Stephanie's every move is being followed by two inept bad guys and her nemesis Joyce (AKA the tramp who slept with Stephanie's ex-husband) who all hope to cash in when they bring in Ranger.  Hot Six is also the book where we are introduced to Bob the pooping retriever with the eating disorder.  I love, love, love Bob.  His intestinal distress makes for many a laugh out loud moment.  Rounding out the cast is the usual group of oddballs:  Lula, the hilarious former prostitute, zany Grandma Mazer (who moves in with Stephanie!), Mooner & Dougie the dopey potheads and Joe Morelli the sexy cop and other object of lust in Stephanie's life.<br />The plot, the characters, heck just about everything about Hot Six is over the top and silly but that's why I enjoyed it.  It's escapist fiction at its best.<br />Read by C.J. Critt this has been my favorite of the recent unabridged recordings.  Critt has a full bodied voice, rich and nuanced with just a touch of sexy raspiness that never gets monotonous or over-the-top.

Set in 1920s deep in the Louisiana bayou Mortal Sins presents so clear a portrait of the time period its almost as if you were there feeling the oppressive heat and smelling all of the scents the bayou has to offer.  Unfortunately, one of those scents is death.<br />Police Officer Damon Day Rourke is called to the murder scene of a prominent lawyer who has been mutilated and brutally butchered and the story, for the most part, is told from Rourkes perspective.  Rourke is connected to the case in many and numerous ways and only becomes more entangled as the story unfolds.  The major suspect in the murder case is the victims glamorous movie star wife, Remy.  Shes also the one woman who broke Rourkes young heart.  Rourke thought hed buried thoughts of Remy deep within him.  He even married a woman who is now conveniently (or tragically, depending on your level of cynicism) dead and is raising his young daughter alone.  Alas, when he sees Remy again all of the hurt, pain and all consuming love comes crashing back and hes determined to prove her innocence regardless of the consequences.  Things become even more complicated when Rourke learns that the system wants to pin the murder on his childhood friend Lucille, a beautiful black woman who was the victims reluctant mistress.<br />Mortal Sins is a book rich in description.  Everything from the murders, the racial tensions of the time, to the hot sweltering landscape is painted with exquisite detail.  And though the book is extremely descriptive (which is important to me), it fails for me on an emotional level because most, if not all, of the characters are so intensely damaged they verge on un-likeability (especially drop-dead gorgeous, seriously disturbed Remy).  In the end I truly didnt care what happened to any of them (with the exception of the sympathetic Lucille).  Rourke may be an outstanding cop but hes a pretty neglectful father and his unflinching support of creepy Remy verges on obsession and makes him come across as a little creepy too.  The characters are interesting, Ill give them that, but it was difficult to work up any sympathy for the lot of em because theyre all so damaged, disturbed or just plain selfish.<br />I give this story three and 1/2 stars because the writing is rich and because I enjoyed the attention to detail and atmosphere.  I also found the mystery and all of the dirty little secrets intriguing and I didnt find it difficult to turn the pages.  But these things arent enough to make me wait with breathless anticipating for the upcoming sequel.<br />~ Laurie Shallahkes him come across as a little creepy too.

She's been in hiding for two years, pleasantly spending her time as a lady's companion.  Though she misses her siblings, and even her grasping parents, her life in hiding is preferable to marrying evil Lord Radnor.<br />Nick Gentry, a Bow Street Runner, has been hired by Radnor to locate Lottie.  To infiltrate society he assumes the identity of bored aristocrat \\"Lord Sydney\\" and quickly locates her.  But something unexpected happens -- loner Nick is fascinated by Lottie and is reluctant to hand her over to the smarmy Radnor.  Her uncommon willfulness and wild need to remain free to live a life of her own choosing draws him to her and he proposes marriage.  She reluctantly agrees but the man she's just agreed to marry isn't all that he appears to be.<br />Nick and Lottie get along fabulously well, considering their basically strangers when married, and their life together is nearly idyllic.  The only thing keeping it from being perfect is Nick's carefree attitude toward his own life and his inability to let go of (and share with Lottie) his horrific past.  His brother-in-law (Ross Cannon from \\"Lady Sophia's Lover\\") does everything in his power to save Nick from himself, even forcing him to claim his title and rightful place in society as the real \\"Lord Sydney\\" but his efforts only enrage Nick.  Will the love of his family and Lottie be enough to save Nick and free him from the demons that threaten to consume him?<br />Well, yeah, of course.  This wouldn't be a romance if the hero jumped off the deep end now would it?  But the getting there is what makes the book emotionally satisfying and so much better than most of the romances I've read recently.  From their first meeting Lottie and Nick's relationship is filled with secret longing and barely restrained passion and once they become intimate their romance becomes an almost all-consuming thing.  It's wonderful to read about two people who \\"fit\\" together so well and whose obstacle isn't silly or petty.  Also helping things along is the fact that both characters are interesting people.  Nick's past gives him an unpredictable edge while Lottie's past gives her the ability to understand, accept and support her tortured husband.  She knows, only all too well, the fear and loathing that comes with living a life one detests.  When these two come together it's magic, if you'll excuse the lame clich&eacute;.

He warns them that sinister killers will soon be after them if they don't hit the road asap.  When Jilly discovers that her car, stolen by \\"Frankenstein\\" (as they dub him), has been torched with \\"Frankenstein\\" still inside she begins to take the dire warnings seriously.  Dylan, an artist traveling around the country with his autistic brother Shephard, advises Jilly to join them on a mad ride away from the ominous, as yet unseen, baddies.  And thus begins their life altering road trip.<br />The book, although a suspenseful road trip into the darkest corners of hell, shines because of its characters.  Thirty year old Dylan has been the sole caretaker of his younger autistic brother Shep ever since their mother died tragically ten years earlier.  Dylan is a kind soul who is eternally patient with his sometimes difficult brother and loves him unconditionally.  His life has been shaped around caring for Shep and initially he's almost too good, too patient, and too kind to be believed but as the book progresses he becomes less of a saint.  His transformation will change him in ways that shock, appall and amaze him.  I found his character the most emotionally compelling.  Jilly is a quirky comedian whose good humor hides a dark.  She travels with a houseplant named Fred (I kid you not) in lieu of a man.  She and Fred have many enjoyable one-sided conversations and Jilly prefers his company to that of a real man.  And then Dylan, a panicked and very bossy Dylan, comes into her life and instantly gets on her last nerve.  Their initial sparring adds a bit of lightness to the tense plot but once they realize they've been altered by the \\"serum\\" and that they're truly on the run for their lives they learn to get along (and begin to like and respect each other) and the plot takes on a much more somber tone.<br />The story takes place over the span of what I believe is little more than 24 hours.  But in that short time span these three characters lives will forever be changed.  The \\"serum\\" gives them strange, awe and fear inspiring abilities and forces Dylan and Shep to face a very dark moment in their past that they've done their best to put behind them.  It's creepy, and moving and continually takes unexpected twists into dark corners.  The pace is fast though Koontz has a tendency to be a little too long winded and overly descriptive but I've come to expect this when I pick up a Koontz novel and it's sort of comical and comforting all at the same time.<br />I read this as an unabridged audiobook and the actor did a fine job.  He had a strong, compelling voice that didn't set me to snoozing and he didn't do any of those cringe-worthy falsetto female voice performances that grate on my nerves.  I always knew when Jilly or Dylan or Shep were speaking.  The only downer?  There's no famous Koontz dog character here!  Instead we get Fred the plant.  And Fred has about as much personality as, well, a houseplant.  About halfway thru the story he's stuffed in the trunk never to be heard from again.

If you're into darker edged fantasy, where the faeries are more likely to wound tender flesh than sprinkle one with faery dust, where sex, violence and various debaucheries are all part of a typical day in the faery kingdom, then do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Tithe.  It's the perfect book to chase away the mid-winter blahs.  Big thanks to Preeti, my reader friend ... for bringing this deliciously dark book to my attention.<br />Kaye is a tough, resourceful, street smart sixteen year old.  As the daughter of a flighty, small-time rock singer who rarely stays in one place for more than six months at a time Kaye's life has been filled with chaos.  When her mother is attacked after a performance she decides to temporarily move them back into her mother's home.  As a child, Kaye loved living in her grandmother's old house and believed she had faery friends.<br />Kaye has always been able to see things other cannot but it's not until she returns to her grandmother's home that she begins to discover exactly how different she is.  In the woods Kaye meets an injured young man with pewter hair and pointy ears named Roiben who requests her help, reluctantly promises her payment and then quickly disappears.  Though Kaye refuses to be anything like her worthless mother and will never pine away after a man she can't seem to get thoughts of Roiben out of her head.<br />Soon after the weird encounter with Roiben, Kaye discovers her imaginary world is not quite so imaginary after all.  After locating two of her old faery friends she discovers that she is fated to play an important (and possibly deadly) role in helping her friends remain free from the warring faery kingdoms (the Seelie and the Unseelie) who want to enslave them.  Kaye's somewhat unstable world becomes even more-so when she enters into a fantasy world filled with magic and dark beauty and the irresistible but terribly confusing dark knight named Roiben who may or may have not killed one of her friends.<br />Tithe is a real page-turner.  I especially enjoyed its bleak, but never overwhelmingly depressing, look at life from a jaded sixteen year old point of view.  Even before Kaye discovers the world of faery her world isn't that of your typical teenager.  Because of her upbringing and lack of parental support she's got an edge about her that makes her refreshingly interesting.  She smokes, talks tough, and holds her own against the flakey, ineffective adults and self-absorbed teens that inhabit her world.  Though she's self-reliant and insightful she's still a teenager prone to emotion, moments of selfishness and wicked thoughts of revenge.  Her faults, as well as her strengths, are the reason I enjoyed her character so much.  Her conflicted feelings for Roiben -- is he tortured hero or cold-hearted fiend? -- are also another fascinating aspect of the story.  Their emerging romance manages to be sensual, touching and anything but the same-old, same-old.  If you're tired of angelic, nauseatingly good heroes and heroines don't worry because you won't find any here!<br />Though I enjoyed this book thoroughly I did spot a few minor problems (sorry, I can't shut off the nitpicker inside me).  With the exception of Kaye, nearly all of the secondary characters aren't given enough space to become very well defined.  This is one case where I think a longer book may have made for a near perfect book (and I almost never say such things).  Kaye's troubled friend Corny and especially Roiben would've benefited from more space to become fully fleshed out characters.  I guess we can hold out hope for a prequel all about Roiben.  There is also some troublesome dialogue here and there that needed a little tweaking.  At times I felt like I'd walked in on the middle of a conversation and missed a sentence or two somewhere along the way.  Other times I felt like the characters must be reading each others minds because their dialogue made little sense to me.  Despite this the story moves very quickly, is imaginative, entertaining and I wish it hadn't had to end quite so soon.  I cannot wait to see what author Holly Black comes up with next.<br />With its adult language, sexuality, violence and alcohol consumption \\"Tithe\\" reads more like an adult novel featuring young protagonists and because of this I'd recommend it for the \\"older\\" young adult ... 4 ½ starse along the way.

The adorable little monsters on the cover of \\"Monster Cake\\" immediately attracted my little girl's attention.  She even bypassed her current favorite, Blue's Clues, when she got an eyeful of this one.  Uh oh, I think my weird taste in books may be catchy!<br />The story is a cute one with a sweet message at its heart.  Three young siblings (who happen to be the most precocious little monsters) awaken early and decide to bake their mom a birthday cake.  Only, since they're monsters, the cake isn't your typical Betty Crocker variety.  They mix together all sorts of gross items including green smiling slugs (!) that fascinated my four year old, along with her six year old brother.  The monsters make a big mess while having a blast along the way and Mom has a fabulous birthday celebration.<br />This is a fun book for all but especially for little ones because there is very little text and colorful, bold, funny illustrations that pre-schoolers can relate to.  Many pages contain no text at all and my four year old loved making up a \\"story\\" for these pages.  For the beginning reader the text is easy to pronounce.  I recommend this book for those looking for an entertaining family reading experience.  It encourages creativity and also a love of storytelling.  ~ Laurie Shallah	2003-02-26

Unnatural Acts is a 190-page collection of Lucy Taylor's erotically charged horror filled short stories.  The title pretty much says it all but take one look at the cover featuring a backside view of a squatting unclothed beastly looking woman giving birth to frogs while a shocked voyeur looks on and you'll realize this isn't stuff for the faint of heart.<br />Taylor takes readers on a journey into the darkest realms both real and imagined.  She writes with unflinching brutality about the grotesque, the disgusting, the shocking and nothing is taboo.  I read this in one fell swoop, unable to stop even when repulsed beyond belief, until I had finished the very last page.  The standout story for me just happens to be the one depicted so grossly on the cover called \\"Baubo's Kiss\\".  It tells about a plain young woman on a trip with her faithless girlfriend who discovers her sexuality in a most unexpected place.  Her transformation from doormat to goddess was awe-inspiring.  \\"Making the Woman\\" is probably the story that disturbed me the most.  It's very short but unforgettable.  It's about two troubled twelve year olds who have seen way too much of the dark side of life.  One day they decide to make themselves a woman.  The cold calculated way in which they perform their task and the final revelation is haunting.  \\"Idol\\" is a dark, dirty tale about a young man named Conners who is obsessed with a wrestler.  When Darius the Python picks Conners out of the crowd to be his sexual partner for the night Conners romantic dreams of forever come true in an unexpectedly twisted way.  Many of the other stories feature cruel men while revenge and the search for pleasure (even when the cost may be intense pain or death) is a common thread that binds them.<br />Lucy Taylor writes extreme horror that can be very unpleasant to read.  So, do I recommend it?  Yes, but only if you know what you're in for.  You've been warned.  Now go find a copy of the book!<br />~LS	2003-02-23

She was looking forward to spending a little quiet time with her lover Paul.  Instead, the trip turns into her worst nightmare.  Paul left to pick up his daughter at the airport fourteen days ago.  He was only supposed to be gone a few hours.  Stranded alone in the scorching desert with very little water and even less food Tally must seek out the nearest town (which is an insurmountable length away) in order to survive.  As a skilled Search and Rescue Wilderness Ranger in the Rocky Mountains, Tally has had extensive training in survival methods.  Unfortunately, Tally is out of her element and all of her survival training is virtually useless in the desolate desert.<br />As Tally leaves the relative safety of the camp she and Paul had built she soon stumbles upon the grisly truth behind Paul's disappearance and realizes she's in far greater danger than she ever anticipated.  Hidden in Paul's ruined vehicle Tally finds Paul's young daughter (from a failed marriage) Josie who has managed to survive on the meager supplies left in the vehicle.  The discovery of Josie gives Tally a reason to carry on even when grief threatens to undo her.  She must, at all costs, get the girl to safety.<br />Gripping from page one \\"Leave No Trace\\" only intensifies as Tally must not only struggle to survive against impossible odds but finds herself running for her life.  Though tense and filled with suspense the book shines as Tally and Josie, initially wary of each other, get to know each other on a level most people will never experience.  Both need each other to survive and forge a bond that gives them the drive to needed to get through the endless days and nights.  The characters experience incredible growth and Tally, especially, finds it a life altering experience.<br />I've never had to struggle to survive nor have I been anywhere even remotely near a barren desert but the author brings the terrifying experience to vivid life.  The things Tally and Josie must do in order to survive are sometimes disturbing and are gruesomely described but never for shock value.  The story slows down here and there but never for any tedious length of time.  Just when it seems like everything will be okay another overwhelming obstacle is thrown in the way.  The desperate search for food, the delirium, exhaustion and unexpected wounds and, again, the careful attention to character development make this book an unforgettable experience.  4 ½ stars<br />~ Laurie Shallahexperience to vivid life.

I received Hard Eight, the unabridged audiobook version, as a present and approached it with a small amount of wariness because the last Janet Evanovich book I read on audio (that would be Seven Up) was ruined by the terrible over the top, cartoon-like rendering of the characters by narrator Tonya Elby.  Hard Eight is read by a woman named Lorelei who takes an extremely different approach to Stephanie.  Her approach, unfortunately, also does not work for me.  Am I too picky, or what?<br />Stephanie's voice as read in this version is way too cultured, way too slow and it doesn't sound at all like the Stephanie Plum we all know and love.  Here she sounds more like an out of place blue blooded socialite than a plucky Trenton, New Jersey girl.  Stephanie's words are too often over-enunciated and the Jersey accent is lost altogether.  And Ranger?!  Ugh, he almost sounds like Fez from \\"That 70's Show\\".  Is there no happy medium here folks?  I must say, though, that the other characters do come to life and the reader did a great job differentiating the characters from each other (unlike the actress who voiced Seven Up).  When a child speaks she sounds like a child.  When a criminal speaks he sounds like a criminal.  Not necessarily a criminal from New Jersey but I guess you just can't have it all.<br />Now about the story:<br />This time around Stephanie is on the search for a missing woman named Evelyn Soder and her young daughter Annie.  Evelyn's grandmother Mabel is a neighbor of the Plum family (this is how Stephanie gets wrapped up in the case).  Evelyn's ex-husband plans to cash in a \\"child custody bond\\" funded by Mabel.  Mabel fears she'll lose her home if Evelyn isn't found and she fears for her great-granddaughter because Evelyn isn't exactly a \\"stable\\" personality.<br />So, Stephanie, our fearless, bumbling bounty hunter and her friend Lula start sniffing around and before long they have a run in with Evelyn's landlord, an evil man named Eddie Abruzzi.  Abruzzi, who gives even street toughened Lula the creeps, is a nasty criminal who adds a much needed dark edge to this predictably frothy series.<br />Rounding out the cast of characters are the usual members that inhabit Stephanie's wild life.  Grandma Mazer is her normally wacky self, Stephanie's not-quite-so-perfect-anymore sister Valerie is still trying to find herself and newcomer Albert Kloughn (pronounced Clown, of course) joins the cast.  He's a goofy lawyer who badly wants to be Stephanie's assistant and begins to follow her around like a lost puppy dog.  Accident prone yet immensely lovable, Kloughn provides a few of the (far too few) comical moments in the story.  The usual run-ins with Ranger and Joe are here but I have to admit this love triangle stuff is getting awfully stale.  Stephanie's still torn between the two sexy men and flip-flops between them.  I wish they'd just hash it out and put an end to this tired \\"who will she pick?\\" drama.  Enough already!<br />This story was my least favorite of the Plum books.  It's not bad by any means and still entertains with its fast pace and moments of wit and I enjoyed the dark edge but the laugh out moments are too few and far between and everything has become too predictable.  Stephanie is stuck in a rut and hasn't grown a bit since Book One.  She keeps repeating the same mistakes that were funny, oh say three books ago?  She forgets her gun, she bumbles her FTA's, she has intense sexual tension with Ranger and Joe, her cars are blown up at an alarming rate, and she eats horrifically bad food but still manages to squeeze into her jeans.  It's all too familiar at this point but, yeah, I'll still buy the next book because even mediocre Stephanie Plum is better than no Stephanie Plum.<br />~ Laurie Shallahwho gives even street toughened Lula the creeps, is a nasty criminal who adds a much needed dark edge to this predictably frothy series.<br />Rounding out the cast of characters are the usual members that inhabit Stephanie's wild life.

Alone.  She's running from her five over protective brothers who plan to marry her off to their respectable but boring friend because she can't seem to stay away from trouble.  Before she reaches her destination, though, she is accosted by a young urchin who steals her purse.  She impulsively chases him into a very dangerous part of town where she witnesses a gang brawl and a death and is taken captive by gang leader Billy Blade.  Hmm, looks to me like Jacinda's brothers may have had a point!<br />Anyway, captivating Billy Blade takes Jacinda to his home.  He's bowled over by her angelic beauty and wants only to keep her safe but one thing leads to another and soon their lips are connected and before you know it Jacinda's nearly lost her virginal status.  Billy, fearing the wraith of Jacinda's brother, stops in the nick of time and returns her safely to her brothers.  Jacinda is furious.  This is the beginning of their passionate on again off again relationship.<br />Billy Blade is much more a complex character than a first glance would assume.  His father, a Marquis, was a cruel, sadistic man whose abuse lead Billy to leave his heritage behind and head for a difficult life lead on the streets.  Out of necessity Billy has become an accomplished thief and lives life on his terms.  His renegade lifestyle catches up with him when he is captured and faces death by hanging.  Billy, left with no options, must face his worst fears and confront his father and the horrific past he left behind if wants to survive.<br />Billy's story (which takes up a large bulk of the book) is absolutely riveting and emotion filled.  I've read a few complaints here and there about the fact that Billy's history takes up too much space and I have to respectfully disagree.  Billy's story is the only thing that kept me turning the pages.  The romance with Jacinda just didn't thrill me.  But let me back up a bit and explain why.  Jacinda is my least favorite type of heroine.  She's young, she's impulsive, she's impossibly gorgeous, she's pampered and spoiled.  She's someone who has a lot of growing up left to do and, unfortunately, she doesn't do all that much of it during the course of the book in my eyes.  Though their love story was very passionate there wasn't much else holding it together.  Jacinda simply was not a good match for Billy's well rounded, thoroughly developed character and he deserved better.<br />I recommend this story for those looking for a historical romance with a deeper than usual hero or for those who don't mind a young heroine who is a bit pea-brained at times.nd explain why.

However, my six year old son brought the book home as a homework assignment so I dutifully read it to the bitter end (it was a bit too wordy for him to read himself).<br />Jack is a young man living with his widowed mom.  In this rendition he is drawn as quite a homely fellow but, hey, we can't all be beauties, can we?  To make matters worse, though, he is described as lazy.  His mom who is barely getting by asks dimwitted Jack to sell their only cow because they're out of money.  On the way to market Jack meets up with an elfin fellow who cons him into trading the cow for a few magical beans.  Jack returns home and his furious mom tosses the beans out the window (I would've brained Jack in the head with them but I digress).  Jack is then rewarded for his stupidity when a magical stalk grows and grows and grows.  I'm sure you know the tale.  He climbs the stalk; he enters the home of two equally homely giants, he begs for food, gets some and then thanks the giants by stealing a bag of gold.  What a role model this Jack is, hmmm?  When he and his mom run through all of gold Jack returns to the lair of the giants to steal their goose that lays golden eggs.  It seems the more Jack steals the bolder and greedier he becomes.  Still not satisfied he returns for a third time and steals the giant's treasured harp.  The harp cries out \\"Master, Master\\" as Jack runs and alerts the giant to the thievery.  This time the giant follows him down the stalk.<br />This is where things go from being annoying to downright confusing.  The giant tumbles down the beanstalk and this is the last we see of him.  I turn the next page and spy Jack sitting (with a golden crown upon his nasty head, mind you) next to a pretty woman.  I read the text aloud.  Twice.  I shake my head in confusion and can't believe my eyes.  Jack apparently marries a beautiful princess and lives happily every after.  In the background the harp is playing beautiful music for them.  Wait just a minute!  Wasn't the harp frightened only a page earlier and crying out for her master, the giant?  And what happened to the poor victimized giant, anyway?  Confused, I check back to assure myself that I hadn't missed a page or two.  I didn't.  After the big build up the story just peters out and comes to an abrupt and unsatisfying end.  Even my kids seemed confused.  Was there a battle? Why wasn't the bad boy punished for stealing?  Valid questions that I simply couldn't answer.<br />In the end none of us were thrilled with this rendition that seems to imply that great rewards can come when one is lazy, sneaky and devious.  The kids (luckily!) didn't like this version of Jack very much and neither did I.rincess and lives happily every after.  In the background the harp is playing beautiful music for them.

The Trouble with Mom is an illustrated children's book (first/second grade reading level) that takes a slightly skewed look at life from the point of view of a young child whose mother is refreshingly different from the rest of his classmates.  The child doesn't find his mom's quirks at all refreshing though and is a little embarrassed by mom.<br />The mom wears lots of bright lipstick, funky pointed hats rimmed with rats, and she wears the most adorable high heels even when she's doing something as ordinary as stirring her bubbling cauldron.  Her gothic looking home is outfitted in spooky d&eacute;cor and she keeps a giant furry bird, a creature that looks like a huggable alligator and a fuzzy tarantula as pets.<br />One day the child decides to invite his friends over for a visit.  The \\"normal\\" parents, of course, are horrified at the suggestion and tell their kids they cannot go.  The kids, being typical kids, ignore their parents, go anyway and have a fabulous time being \\"wild\\".  When their parents discover where they've been they freak and call the \\"different\\" mom some hurtful names which make her sad.<br />When the school is ravaged by a terrible fire and the \\"witch\\" mom saves the day the other parents realize that, hey, maybe they were wrong and she's okay after all!  A lesson is learned by all.  The young child and the PTA members accept the unique mom for who she is and learn to co-exist quite nicely after their rough start.<br />This is a great story with some laugh out loud moments, comical illustrations and a thoughtful message.  The words were all familiar or easy enough that my six year old beginning reader figured them out without becoming frustrated.  He enjoyed reading the entire story to his little sister and read each word with enthusiasm.  Being six, he particularly enjoyed the illustrations of the \\"Fear Factor-like\\" cupcakes his mom served to members of the PTA that were crawling with bugs and other various grossness (I got quite the laugh out of the horrified reactions of the parents too).  This is a five star read in our house!f the horrified reactions of the parents too).  This is a five star read in our house!	2003-01-30

In the Forest of the Night contains only 147 pages and those pages are filled with big fonts and lots of white space.  Hmmm, $$.$$ for less than an hours worth of reading seems a bit steep, but maybe it's just me?<br />Risika is a 300 year old vampire who was turned and torn from everything she loved when she was only seventeen.  The story flips back and forth between present day and the time when Risika was a mortal on the eve of her change.<br />I thought the past story was more engaging than the present.  In the present Risika discovers that her archenemy, a darkly handsome Eeevil vampire named Aubrey (who is evil, I'm guessing, simply because he can be), is near and begins causing her great distress.  She fears him, he's more powerful than she, but yet stubbornly defies him, baits him and, by her actions, basically dares him to come after her.  It didn't make any sense to me.  Because of her actions a tragedy occurs and I groaned aloud out of frustration.  For a 300 year old vampire she doesn't appear all that bright and is completely ineffective for the majority of the book when it comes to dealing with Aubrey.  The glimpses into Risika's past as she learns to live her life in darkness are much more interesting than the present bits with Aubrey.<br />The writer was only 13 when she wrote the story (according to the blurb) and, to my jaded eyes, it shows.  Her character lacks maturity and common sense and character motivation wasn't explored as nearly as fully as it should have been.  There was also an odd sense of emotional detachment throughout the book and I never felt like I knew any of these characters very well.  But it was the ending that truly did me in.  Everything is wrapped up with a twist that isn't explained and didn't make a lick of sense and, again, the lead character acts oddly and without emotion.  Though the atmosphere was done exceptionally well (all dark and broody-like) I was left in the dark too often when it came to character motivation and the plot was too thin to rate this book as anything more than average.<br />~ Laurie Shallahoo often when it came to character motivation and the plot was too thin to rate this book as anything more than average.<br />~ Laurie Shallah	2003-01-28

In this story yet another of her larger than life heroes falls prey to true love while battling a terrorist cell or two along the way.  While I've been following this series since its beginning I do believe I may be done waiting with breathless anticipation for the next installment which promises to wrap up character Sam Starret's love story.  More on that later.<br />This time around Lieutenant Mike Muldoon finds love.  He's a twenty-five year old sweetie-pie of a man who prefers brainy, older, unconventional looking woman and wants to be loved for more than his drop-dead gorgeous looks.  A[...]  When the President sends his public relations assistant, 30-ish Joan DaCosta, to scope out his team and view their maneuvers Mike is assigned as her SEAL liaison.  He's instantly smitten by the smart, funny, sexy woman and pulls out all the stops to impress her.  Unfortunately, Joan insists on thinking of Mike as her \\"younger brother by a different mother\\" and refuses to enter into any sort of relationship with him because she feels he's way too young and sexy for an older lady like herself.  Instead she tries to set him up with the President's daughter which, of course, backfires in the worst way possible.<br />Though Joan is intelligent and has a wonderful sense of humor she doth protest too much when it comes to her relationship with Mike.  And, as much as I enjoyed their love story I do wish more of the book had been committed to it.  Sadly, Mike and Joan's relationship seemed like just another subplot to the many others crowding the book and I didn't experience the closeness to the characters that I have in the previous Brockmann SEAL books.  Taking up a whole lotta space was the obligatory World War II flashbacks and the extended glimpses into Mary Lou and Sam Starret's miserable marriage.<br />This brings me to the ongoing tale of doomed romance between fellow SEAL Sam Starret and Alyssa.  Several books back I ached for the couple who were separated just when they'd found true love.  Now, I'm just sick and tired of them.  In this entry Sam (who married Mary Lou when he discovered she was pregnant with his child a few books back) is transformed into a miserable husband and a neglectful father.  He spends the bulk of the story doing nothing but pining away for his Alyssa instead of acting like a real man and asking Mary Lou for a divorce (which would be a blessing for her).  A miraculous thing does happen here though.  Mary Lou, who was previously an obnoxious, drunken lush, is now a recovering alcoholic and a loving mother who becomes a sympathetic (but still quite needy) character.  She struggles to do the right thing and longs for love with a desperation that is almost heartbreaking.  Mary Lou is friendless and out of a need for comfort and help battling her want for alcohol she forms a tentative friendship with a kind man of Arab descent despite her initial fear of his looks.  Their friendship was genuine and interesting.  Too bad I can't say the same for Sam whose appearances were tedious and unsympathetic.  At this point Sam is a creep in my book and I could care less if he gets together with Alyssa in a future book.<br />Also going on is (what seems at this point to be) the token look back in history.  Joan's grandmother Charlotte DaCosta looks back to the grief filled year she lost her husband and met a young soldier named Vince during World War II.  These glimpses into the past were more of a distraction than anything and I felt jolted out of the story every time they appeared.  Normally these flashbacks add richness to the current story but this time they didn't work for me and they didn't seem to mesh with the rest of the story at all.<br />Finally, unlike Brockmann's previous books, \\"Into The Night\\" contains a shockingly small of amount of action (I say this because her books are usually non-stop and are impossible to put down!).  As a result, it took me over four weeks to get up the ambition to finish this one despite the great characterization of Mary Lou, the humor threaded throughout and the mostly enjoyable love story between Mike and Joan.

I was thrilled when I received the unabridged audiotape version of Seven Up.  I love Stephanie Plum and her bumbling bounty hunter adventures and figured these tapes would be a welcome distraction during my long drive to and from work.  But once I actually started listening to tape one I was not so thrilled.  In fact, my head began to ache and my right temple still throbs when I so much as think of the experience (okay, so maybe I exaggerate but not by much).<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, the story here is your typical Plum novel that's filled with madcap adventure and larger than life zany characters.  This time around Stephanie Plum, our lovable bounty hunter, is chasing after an old coot named Eddie DeChooch.  What should be an easy catch (and easy money for Stephanie) turns into so much more when a body is found on DeChooch's property.  Kidnappings follow and a mad search for a missing organ ensues.  To complicate matters Stephanie's sister returns home and decides she's going to become a lesbian.  Fellow bounty hunter Ranger tempts Stephanie by simply being Ranger but Stephanie is still somewhat engaged to Joe Morelli the drop dead sexy cop.  The action is pretty much non-stop and there are many more characters (a few too many, if you ask me) who make appearances and add to the overall wacky tone of the story.  Like I said, this is standard Plum fare.  Though not as laugh out loud funny as some of the earlier Plum outings this story is a great way to spend a few hours.  BUT please make sure you buy the paperback and not this unabridged audiotape version (with a very flimsy box, I might add).<br /><br />Why?  Simply put the narrator, Tanya Eby, single-handedly saps the enjoyment out of the tale by slaughtering the voices.  Her reading makes the listening experience highly painful.  The New Jersey accents are horrendous and, what with all the \\"R\\" dropping, sound (to my MA/NH ear) more like a cartooney Boston accent than anything else.  Adding to the problem is the fact that most of the characters come off sounding very much alike and at times the accent falters completely!  There are also way too many moments where Stephanie's voice spouts out Morelli's lines or vice versa.  It was disconcerting to say the least.  Mooner (or should that be Moona?) and Dougie sound like identical morons instead of the lovable pot heads we know them to be.  Daffy Grandma Mazer sounds like Katherine Hepburn on a very bad day and, well, I could go on but I'm sure you get the picture.  This narrator may be a fine actress but she was a poor choice for this story.  This is a cringe-worthy performance to be sure.<br /><br />I give this production three stars.  The story actually rates a four but, ahhh!, the torturous reading of the book drags it down to a three (a two if I weren't feeling so generous).is the fact that most of the characters come off sounding very much alike and at times the accent falters completely!

In the process she stomped all over Buck's heart. Heartbroken he turned to booze and women. Headed straight for Hell, he was saved by Georgina, an older woman who saw his potential and made him a singing sensation. She molds him into the man the public sees and he marries her even though he'll never love her.<br />When Tess and Buck meet up again (years later) the sparks fly and they realize what empty lives they've been living. In a few short days their love is reborn. Only now there are two big obstacles in their way: Georgina (for starters) and Buck's good-guy persona. Will they sacrifice their careers or their hearts?  Will I care when they do?  (The answer to that one would be NO)<br />Ms. Garrett has a beautiful way of describing the Ozarks and her vivid imagery breathes life into this familiar story of lost love. Despite her lyrical writing I thought the heroine was self-centered and very difficult to sympathize with. The hero never came alive for me because we mainly see him through the heroine's eyes and learn his feelings via his song lyrics.  This did not work for me.  I would've enjoyed a hundred or so more pages of the hero's viewpoint. And (finally, you say?) I thought the ending was way too vague and pat.	2002-12-30

She's an Englishwoman and has been abducted by an overzealous young Arab. A romantic, Desdemona begins to fantasize about how exciting it might be to bought by a desert Prince. Then opportunist Harry Braxton shows up to save her hide. She can't believe her rotten luck and tells him, \\"If you bought me I'll kill you!\\".<br />Thus begins this truly fun, character driven, adventurous read. We soon find out why Dizzy (as Harry so charmingly calls her) is so disappointed with her savior. He is the scoundrel who broke her heart several years earlier. Unable to avoid each other (he's an archeologist often in need of Dizzy's translation skills) they have forged a platonic friendship.<br />Dizzy never had a childhood. A child prodigy, her parents forced her to study languages and traveled around the world to show off her talents. When her parents died her Egyptologist Grandfather brought her to Cairo and she has been eking out a living using her language skills. Her fondest dream is living a normal life in England but, unfortunately, she's broke.<br />She loves Harry but will never allow him to hurt her again. When Harry's hunky, brooding cousin Lord Ravenscroft shows up in Egypt she realizes he may just be the perfect antidote to Harry. Blake is a boring, sensible, uptight fuddy-duddy. He's everything her head tells her she needs ~- if she could only convince her heart she'd be all set.<br />Harry (of course) loves Dizzy but he is unwilling to allow her to give up her dreams to make him happy so he pushes her away for her own good. He is hiding a painful secret that makes him feel inadequate and he will not return to England after his dreadful childhood. But when she starts making eyes at his priggish cousin he loses all sense of his faculties.<br />I don't want to give too much away of this irresistible story so I'll just say that these two have my vote for most lovable couple of the year! They compliment each other perfectly in every way. Harry is a wonderfully original wounded hero. He's a man man enough to admit his love (there's no annoying denial of feelings going on with this guy!), shed a few tears, and face down a madman for the woman he loves.  Dizzy (despire her name) is intelligent, strong, funny and she reads erotic scrolls when no one is looking. She's a romantic and a heroine the reader can easily relate to.

The original review will be deleted via Amazon.<br />Maggie Shayne's newest addition to her fantastic vampire series is her most emotionally charged yet.<br />A week before she is about to take her final vows and become a nun Angelica ventures out alone at night to help the homeless. On the way to the shelter she is attacked by a ruthless vampire and transformed into one of the undead.<br />Jameson Bryant's life has been haunted by the evil DPI (Department of Paranormal Investigations/vampire killers ~ if you were wondering) because he has a rare blood type that will allow a vampire to transform him into a creature of the night. He escapes their clutches but during the last set of tests they happen to take more than just Jameson's blood. They've take his sperm (yikes!) in order to start their next phase of experiments.<br />Jameson finds Angelica near death suffering from self imposed starvation and although he knows she is dangerous something about her calls out to him and he is compelled to help her. Too hungry to resist what Jameson offers she drinks from him and cannot stop . . .  Just as she realizes she's ended this beautiful, kind man's life a DPI agent shows up.  In her fear and confusion she believes him when he says he can make her mortal again. The DPI fear vampires and it is their intent to exterminate the race. In their never-ending paranoia they discover it may be possible for a newly turned vampire to become impregnated. Angelica naively becomes their guinea pig in their newest and most heartless experiment to date.<br />Fortunately Jameson's vampire friends show up in time to transform him and when he learns of the results of the DPI's experiments he sets out to find Angelica. Although she thinks he's a monster and he despises her for cutting his mortal life short they must join forces if they are to save another innocent from the hellish clutches of the DPI.<br />BORN IN TWILIGHT is one of the best books I've read in a long time and the most original and emotional vampire novel I've ever read. The best thing about this story is the care Ms. Shayne takes to develop the love story and the characters. She didn't take the easy way out and let them fall into a silly love/hate relationship so prominent in many novels. The characters struggle and grow and slowly begin to like each other almost against their will. They were real people and when they fall in love you know it's for eternity. This romance is the stuff dreams are made of.<br />Ms. Shayne's amazing storytelling talent shines in BORN IN TWILIGHT. The ultimate page-turner, it is a not to be missed read for lovers of a fast paced, darkly sensual, deeply emotional, tear jerking stories.  Although it is a spin-off of her popular Wings In The Night series (for the now defunct Silhouette Shadows line) it very easily stands alonen forces if they are to save another innocent from the hellish clutches of the DPI.<br />BORN IN TWILIGHT is one of the best books I've read in a long time and the most original and emotional vampire novel I've ever read.

As the author note states this is a true beauty and the beast story. One where the love of a strong woman saves the soul of the beastly creature she has somehow fallen for. Although the hero in SECRET THUNDER isn't hideously deformed (in fact he is a gorgeous male specimen) he more than fits the bill of the beast as the reader discovers right off the bat.<br />He is Luke de Periguerix, AKA the Black Dragon, a fearsome Norman warrior known for his ruthlessness on the battlefield. Fortunately, for the reader, underneath all of the brawn and ruthlessness lies a man with a kind heart whose biggest dream after facing (and committing) the worst atrocities of war is to live out the rest of his life quietly on a farm.<br />She is Faithe, a widowed Saxon woman, strong of heart and mind.  She's a woman who loves her home so fiercely she is willing to marry the enemy in order to keep it.<br />Once married the two are fiercely attracted to each other but naturally have reservations about forming any kind of relationship. Just as things begin to fall into place for them a secret Luke wishes to remain buried comes back to haunt him and threatens their budding relationship.<br />The story starts out crudely and contains some very gruesome scenes. This is one author who does not pretty up the blood and brutality of the times she is writing about. But don't let this put you off; Ms. Rice balances the gore and darkness with many moments of compassion, beauty and light.<br />This book is sensual, very sensual and although the story line might sound familiar to many romance readers it features a very unique heroine. She's a widow who, imagine this, has enjoyed sex before she meets the hero! This, among many other things, endeared me to her and made for some very racy and exciting scenes. It also made her a real person in my eyes. I'm a little tired of the virginal heroine (be she a widow or not). Faithe was a nice change of pace.<br />The descriptions of life at the time are done so well you'll be sweating alongside the characters as they shear the sheep in the sweltering sun, you'll smell the stench of blood and grime on the unwashed bodies after battle. Ms. Rice is just so darn good you'll feel like you're there.<br />The plot does have a tendency to rely on misunderstandings between both characters. This is something that usually bugs me but because the writing is so exciting and realistic this didn't mar my enjoyment at all. I think it's because the reasons for the misunderstandings were valid and honorable rather than silly, petty things. I didn't feel like slapping anyone silly because I understood their reasons for not coming clean. I felt like crying for them both because of their predicaments.<br />The characterization (especially Luke's) is absolutely stunning. I've got to admit that after the first few chapters this is one beast that I was bound and determined to hate and I was ready to put the book aside but I'm so glad I continued reading. Ms. Rice's talented hand made him human and compassionate and, believe me, it was no easy feat with this hero! SECRET THUNDER might make you queasy, it might make you cry and it might even make you laugh. Which when you come down to it is the reason many of us read fiction ~ to be swept away and drawn into another place and time, even if we wouldn't want to stay there.  These are all things this book fully delivers.<br />If you are a medieval fan, a beauty and the beast fan, or just like a really well told story that packs an emotional wallop SECRET THUNDER is most definitely worth a few hours of your precious reading timeo well you'll be sweating alongside the characters as they shear the sheep in the sweltering sun, you'll smell the stench of blood and grime on the unwashed bodies after battle.

The original review will be deleted via Amazon.<br />A Little Something Extra is perfect if you are looking for a fun, magical read just in time to get you in the mood for St. Patrick's Day.<br />P.J. is a freelance investigative reporter with a special interest in magic and psychic phenomena. She has a burning desire to believe in magic but unfortunately cannot find any hard proof that it actually exists. Along comes Connor O'Flaherty, a magical shoe salesman (of all things!), who tempts her with a job offer she can't resist. He claims he is not only a leprechaun but also King of all the Fae folk. He needs her help to track down his sister's stolen talisman. Without it his sister is a basket case and his business is in dire trouble.<br />She doesn't buy his story. Aren't leprechauns little guys with pointy noses that wear silly hats? He is as gorgeous as he is kooky so she weighs out the pros and cons and decides to accept the job. After all, if he's nutty enough to pay her to travel around the world who is she to refuse?<br />They set off together to catch themselves a crook and find themselves falling for each other no matter how much they try to resist. Unfortunately, as King of the Fae it is Connor's duty to marry a woman who has Fae blood running through her veins. After centuries of mating with humans their blood lines have become seriously diluted and their magic is weakening. Torn between love and duty Connor fights a losing battle. He must convince P.J. to believe in magic but even if he manages that impossible task will it be enough to save them both from heartache?<br />Lots of magic and characters who have a charming sense of humor make A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA a book to savor. I figured out who the thief was long before the characters did but anxiously turned the pages anyway to come to the pleasing conclusion of this enchanting love story.

Then you obviously haven't read THE PROMISE OF JENNY JONES yet! Breaking all kinds of stereotypes Ms. Osborne creates an untraditional heroine you can't help but admire, laugh with and cry for.<br />Jenny Jones, accused of killing a man in self defense, is awaiting death by a firing squad when she is approached by a rich dying woman who offers to take her place. Naturally, there is a catch. Jenny must promise to deliver the woman's daughter safely into the arms of her Father in California. Jenny is a loner who thinks kids are barely half human but decides her life, as pitiful as it may be, is worth the aggravation.<br />Jenny not only finds herself saddled down with a snot nosed, prissy kid who prays for her death each night but hot on her trail are the kids' money grubbing cousin's who are bent on killing little Graciela so they can grab her inheritance. To make matters worse Jenny is also being followed by Ty Sanders, a real sexy dude, who appears to want Graciela for his own perverted reasons.<br />Ty, unbeknownst to Jenny, is also on the same mission. He is Graciela's uncle and has been sent by his brother to retrieve her. He'll do everything he can to save his niece from the hands of the obviously insane Miss Jenny Jones. Still, as nutty as he finds her he can't help being attracted to her.  She fascinates him and this scares him more than Graciela's murderous cousins.<br />Eventually these two hard headed, tough as nail people realize they need to stop beating the crap out of each other and join forces if they intend to bring Graciela home safely.<br />The three spend time together and struggle to keep themselves alive but will they be strong enough to protect their hearts from breaking when they're forced to say goodbye at the end of the trip?<br />THE PROMISE OF JENNY JONES is often times hilarious and extremely touching.  Ms. Osborne handled Jenny's gradual transformation from loner to big hearted woman so beautifully I had tears in my eyes throughout a major part of the book. I also liked the little girl Graciela's transformation from a stuck-up little brat to a sensitive and loving little girl. And, of course, Ty was also a terrific hero whose first mistake is assuming he is going to tame Jenny! The character growth in this story is just amazing. Because the character's are so well drawn and actually get to know each other before they jump into bed the love story between this unlikely couple is completely believable and the sexual tension intense.<br />The grittiness, humor, realism and emotion of this story are just a few of the things that make it so special.

Candles for Elizabeth is a thin chapbook containing barely 60 pages of fiction (a few of the pages consist of introductions, the table of contents, etc).  It's a bit pricey but it is oversized and has a glossy, creepy cover with gorgeous fonts instead of the standard drek found on most covers.  Still, the text within is what I'm paying for and I can't help wishing there had been  more of it.<br />The chapbook contains three short stories. One is an original written for the collection and two are reprints.  All of the stories are difficult to synopsize.  They're more like quick glimpses into these character lives than a by-the-numbers horror story and are told in a dream-like voice.  The author relies on her wounded young characters and well-drawn atmosphere to tell the story and deftly holds back allowing the reader to use their own imagination.  Her style takes some getting used to and probably isn't for everyone but I had no problem with it.  There are no bloated sentences here and no unnecessary words.  Personally, I found it a relief.  The less bloat the better if you ask me.  These stories aren't horrific in the traditional sense but they'll linger and haunt if you read closely.<br />Of all of the stories my personal favorite was \\"A Story for Edward Gorey\\".  It was genuinely chilling.  Everything from the oppressive heat, to the almost overwhelming feeling of loneliness and desperation comes vividly alive.<br />After reading The Last Child of Lir, a story the author says is a companion piece to two of her others, I had the urge to track down the other two stories.  Although the characters and the grief-laden tale drew me in, I felt like I was missing something and needed more insight into these people and their lives.  As written, this story didn't entirely stand-alone for me.<br />The final story, Postcards From the King of Tides, takes the reader on a road trip that takes a turn for the weird when the car breaks down and two of its curious occupants discover an odd sideshow.  Odd and creepy.  What more does one need?<br />More stories would've rated this book five stars but for five dollars (plus shipping) it was a tad too slight for the money.  Still, I enjoyed it while it lasted and am left longing for more.an odd sideshow.  Odd and creepy.

Brite's EXQUISITE CORPSE is darker and infinitely more disturbing than any of her previous works. This is an unflinching, unapologetic love story between two cannibalistic serial killers.<br />Brite's writing is done so well you can almost smell the scents of the decadent French Quarter.  Her dialogue is clear, cutting and painfully honest, her imagery so vivid when that first slice is made into the delicate human abdomen you feel your own guts begin to churn. The story is made all the more chilling because of the point of view switches. She takes the reader into the head of not only the victim but the killers as well. Be warned this is not a book for the faint of heart. It's filled with powerful, grotesque erotic images, and unspeakable acts of pain, torture and humiliation. Unlike many other killer novels the author makes no excuses for her characters. They were not molested, beaten or neglected as children.<br />EXQUISITE CORPSE is a chilling trip into the darkest corners of the human mind and puts a new spin on the idea of eternal love. Exquisitely Frightening.	2002-12-19

She quickly finds herself deeply entangled in the case when the victim's girlfriend hires her to investigate the vampire lead after the Police refuse to believe vampires exist.<br />Vampire Henry Fitzroy has his own personal agenda for finding this apparent vampire killer. Sure, he drinks blood but he certainly is not a killer. He's just trying to eke out a living as a romance writer and maintain a low profile in order to avoid having his head cut off and stuffed with garlic by superstitious, hysteria driven fanatics.<br />Norman Birdwell, a ..

I could talk about the post civil war Texas setting and describe the mail order bride plot but that doesn't even begin to touch on the emotional impact of Ms. Heath's newest work. This book touched me from beginning to end and is a book I'll always treasure. It's also the first of a trilogy.  Woo-hoo!<br /><br />Houston Leigh's brother Dallas has broken his leg and is unable to make the trip to pick up his mail order bride-to-be Amelia Carson. Houston has hideous facial scarring on one side of his handsome face and has lived his adult life hiding in shadows and covering his face with his hat. He has shunned human contact and feels most content in the company of his horses. Because of his scars and less than charming personality Dallas feels it's safe to assume his new bride won't fall for his brother during the three week trek.<br /><br />Amelia is disappointed that she has to spend three weeks with her fianc&eacute;'s grouchy brother but tries to make the best out of her situation by trying to engage him in conversation.  She bugs him with irritating questions he doesn't want to answer and eventually she gets under his skin.  Although it scares him he slowly opens up to her and they form a hesitant friendship which gets stronger as the days pass and they reveal bits of themselves to each other. Both of their lives have been shattered by the war and they've both dealt with it differently. He has given up on his dreams and withdrawn from the world while she is the eternal optimist finding something to be grateful for in every situation.  She looks at her future with joy anxiously biding her time when she can turn her dreams into reality. She even manages to find a dream for Houston to believe in but they despair because she is promised to his brother . . .<br /><br />The hurting and lovable characters are what make this story so memorable. In the majority of romances I've read one character usually really comes alive while the other gets the short shrift. That's so not so in this case!  I loved the heroine as much as the hero in TEXAS DESTINY. She's a woman who has seen the worst life has to offer but hasn't been beaten down by it. Her optimism and willingness to embrace life is refreshing and believable. And Houston . . . he's my favorite kind of hero. He's a wounded soul, with lots of integrity, he's serious, heroic, and best of all he's sensitive. He's been dealt a raw deal by life and really needs a hug. This story is extremely realistic for instance there is no witty banter during their first few days together but instead there are lots of awkward attempts at conversation and long silences.  Houston's makes several desperate attempts to come up with words to charm Amelia but always ends fails.  These little touches are what make the couple so endearing.<br /><br />I know many readers avoid the Civil War period but this book is less about the war and more about the healing of two people who as children had to bear witness to human nature's darkest side. But don't think it's all darkness and pain! The book is filled with so many tender moments my eyes were stinging and there is a quiet wit that made me smile. The longing, the soft caresses, the hot kisses, the despair and the impossible love these two share made my heart ache but somehow they always managed to maintain their senses of humor. The sense of place is done so well I felt like I was living the story. I stayed up late reading with a flashlight until 12am last night because I just didn't want to put this book down.

What I liked most about this book was the way the author developed the hero and heroine. We get to see them as little brats and are allowed to grow up with them. I typically don't enjoy *saga* type books and prefer to get to the action right away but these two kids and their story were so interesting and the characters so very well developed that I became attached to these two and couldn't wait to see what happened next.<br />The hero starts life as a wounded little boy and develops into a strong, secure, sensitive man thanks to the loving attention of his *adopted* family.

P>Every now and then I'm lucky enough to come across a very special book that demands my attention and captures my heart. A book whose characters refuse to leave my mind once the last page is turned. A book that is filled with everything that I love about reading romance.  A POCKETFUL OF PARADISE is my idea of a dream book.<br />Immortal spirit Zacariah has been a soul collector for eons and is getting a little lackadaisical about his duties. His job is to collect the soul of a dying human and usher it into the afterlife. Because he has a little problem showing up on time for his \\"collections\\" he has altered more than one human life span. His superiors are furious with his blatant disregard for human life and have decided to teach him a lesson. Hoping he will learn to respect humans, his punishment is to spend one month on earth as a mortal man and at the end of that time make a collection ON TIME!!<br />Zack appears in a haze of mist and clouds before the startled eyes of widow Rebecca Hale. Rebecca is determined to save her son's inheritance, the Hale ranch, even though someone has been stealing her horses at an alarming rate. A bit wary of this stranger who appears to have a strange sort of amnesia she agrees to take Zack on as a farm hand because he'll work cheap and she desperately needs some help.<br />Rebecca struggles to protect her heart from this drifter but there is something irresistible about him, a kindness buried beneath the gorgeous exterior. When she sees him treating her son with the compassion, respect and attentiveness he craves she becomes all the more determined to protect them both from heartbreak. But as an innocent kiss leads to a scorching attraction Rebecca finds it difficult to resist this desirable man who awakens feelings she didn't know existed.<br />Zack is one of the most original hero's I've read in quite a while. A virgin in the true sense of the word its great fun watching him attempt to function with his \\"clumsy\\" human body as he learns to walk, shave and discovers a certain part of his anatomy that he can't seem to control when he looks at the heroine. As he becomes more and more human he begins to realize he's falling in love but he cannot give Rebecca the one thing she needs from him; the truth and he still has that collection to make before he can return to heaven . . . Torn between hurting the people he's grown to love and further upsetting his superiors Zack must make the ultimate sacrifice.<br />Ms. Kane writes with a rare sensitivity that thoroughly draws you into the story.  Her characters are people you care deeply about. A POCKETFUL OF PARADISE with its reluctant and sensitive grim reaper hero has humor in all the right places yet is jam-packed with heart wrenching emotion. You'll need a few tissues before you're finished with this uplifting story.<br />I loved every word.learns to walk, shave and discovers a certain part of his anatomy that he can't seem to control when he looks at the heroine.

Pancakes, Pancakes! is another beautifully illustrated Eric Carle book for the youngsters.  My son likes nothing better than a huge plate of pancakes for breakfast and was attracted to this book immediately upon viewing its cover depicting a large, happy pancake.<br />Pancakes, Pancakes! tells the story of a hungry little boy who wakes one morning with a craving for pancakes.  He asks him mom for pancakes but she's too busy and tells him to collect the things needed to make them instead (they apparently don't sell the frozen ones in this story).  He's a good little boy and does so without complaint.  He has to make the flour (by hand!), wait for the hen to lay an egg, milk the spotted cow, churn the butter and so on until he has all of the ingredients assembled.  Frankly, I was surprised this poor child didn't complain and then collapse from exhaustion!  Finally, the sweet boy gets his pancakes and all ends well.<br />My kids were riveted to this tale and especially enjoyed the illustrations. They were particularly fascinated by the page containing a picture of the ingredients the boy collected.  The story also invited a lot of questions (my kids are used to microwave pancakes and were quite bewildered by the lengths the boy had to go to for breakfast).  They both seemed to enjoy it very much and, best of all, it held their attention and made them think and ask questions instead of zoning out while I read.  All of this combined with the beautiful art work makes Pancakes, Pancakes! a keeper for us.	2002-12-18

The original review will be deleted via Amazon.<br />THE LOVE CHARM is another irresistible read about hard working, down to earth characters from the always wonderful pen of Pamela Morsi. Set in the Louisiana bayou Ms. Morsi brilliantly brings all of the scents, smells and customs of the small tight-knit community of Acadia to life.<br />As a child Aida Gaudet concocts a love charm she insists will make the man of her dreams fall deeply and forever in love with her. Aida, being a bit featherbrained, hands the charm over to her best friend Armand Sonnier then forgets about it when her father calls her for dinner.<br />Years later Aida, now the town beauty, has all of the local men and her childhood friend Armand vying for her affection. Armand has kept his feelings to himself knowing he can never win her hand because he is \\"plain\\" and also the shortest man in Acadia and has resigned himself to a life without her. A[...] . .  how can you not instantly love this guy?  Also standing in the way is the small fact that Aida is engaged to his best friend Laron. She has agreed to marry Laron, the most handsome man in Acadia, because it is what is expected of her. Aida has given up dreaming about true love knowing men only care about her looks and will never love her as a person.<br />When Armand, in a moment of jealousy, thoughtlessly spills the beans about Laron's secret mistress he inadvertently upsets several lives but especially his own. With a little push from a meddling soothsayer Armand sets out on a path to set things right and finds himself spending most of his waking hours with Aida in an attempt to thwart fate.<br />It is wonderful watching these seemingly opposite characters overcome their enormous insecurities before they are able to truly open their hearts to each other.<br />THE LOVE CHARM delivers everything I look forward to in a Morsi book and then some. With a little helpful magic, a bit of humor, lots of tugs at the heartstrings and major sexual tension Ms. Morsi masterfully ties up not one but three intriguing love stories and manages to make us care deeply about all six characters. Very Highly Recommended.ARM delivers everything I look forward to in a Morsi book and then some.

Included was the story Rooster's Off To See The World.  The colorful artwork is visually stunning and captivates both of my children who insisted I read it NOW!<br />The story tells the tale (with lots of repetitive text) of an ambitious rooster who sets out to see the world.  He leaves his cozy home safe behind to embark on his trip.  On each page he picks up a few new friends who are also seduced by the temptation to \\"see the world\\".  Unfortunately, rooster isn't all that bright and he forgets to make plans for basic necessities like food and shelter.  So when the sun goes down rooster and his new friends are cold and hungry.  They all begin to complain.  Soon, rooster's fair weather friends begin to desert him (the turtle's even leave without bothering to say goodbye!).  Before long poor defeated rooster is left all alone.  A dejected rooster ponders his mistakes, takes a short nap and heads back out to his cozy home without seeing much of the world at all and the book comes to an end.<br />Both of my kids lingered on each beautiful page instead of rushing along to see what happens next in the story as they usually do.  My sensitive four year old said she felt very sad when this story came to its end because Rooster's so-called friends left him alone but my six year old enjoyed it.  He particularly enjoyed counting all of roosters new friends who appeared in little boxes in the upper corner of each page and said he'd like to read it again so it's a keeper for my son, anyway. ~ Laurie Shallah	2002-12-17

Naked Came The Phoenix was a book selection for two of my local reading groups because we were intrigued by its unusual format.  Twelve bestselling mystery and suspense author joined together to contribute a chapter to this murder-mystery, soap-opera.  The catch?  Each other must pick up where the last left off and continue the story using the same cast of characters, all of who get zanier as the story progresses.<br />The opening chapter written by Nevada Barr sets up the story and, in my opinion, was the driest, dullest entry in the entire book.  It's here that the lifeless main characters are introduced (luckily they don't stay that way!).  After the recent death of her father, Caroline, wife of a big shot Congressman, agrees to spend some quality bonding time with her difficult mother at a high-end health spa.  Caroline's fellow guests at the spa include an aging rock legend, a quirky psychic, a starving model and loads of other oddballs and Hollywood \\"it\\" types.<br />After the sloooow start, JD Robb picks up the tempo in chapter two.  She breaths life into Caroline's character by bringing her down to earth in a funny little adventure brought about by hunger.  She also adds a hunky pool-boy to the ever growing list of characters and kicks things into high gear by killing off the snooty spa owner!<br />Things get silly as each character seems to harbor some dirty secret and the murder count becomes ridiculously high as each author adds their own little twists and turns to the story and attempts to pick up where the previous author left off.  A friend of mine described the characters as \\"manic depressives\\" and she was right on.  Each character switches moods and personalities from chapter to chapter which only added to the sense of fun.  Eventually, all dangling threads and over-the-top plot twists were neatly brought together by author Laurie King.<br />I'd read another book like Naked Came The Phoenix for the fun factor alone.  But would I read this one again?  Umm, probably not.Umm, probably not.	2002-12-17

Cliff wonders how Anne can be in two places at once but is so thrilled just to be with her he doesn't question her sudden appearances in his room. As her sexual demands get fiercer and more dangerous he realizes all isn't as it appears. The ending is shocking and moving.<br />In Deidre Cox's PLAYERS a woman betrayed by her man seeks out a \\"filth eater\\" to cleanse this cheating slime ball of his hurting ways. It's a wonderfully nasty tale of ultimate revenge.<br /><br />The Healing Touch by Terry Campbell is reminiscent of the wonderfully wicked GEEK LOVE by Katherine Dunn. It tells the story of a woman with so deep a compassion for the afflicted she goes to amazing lengths to make them feel better. She sees beauty where others see only deformities.

This one's a tear jerker, at least for me, anyway.<br />Nancy Holder ends things on a most repulsive note with BONUS NOTCHES. This is the tale of two bored housewives who go to frightening lengths to out do each other.

KOATS ended with quite the cliffhanger and after waiting for what seemed like an eternity we finally learn the sexy Familiar's fate in Rejar.<br />Rejar, after tumbling through space for several months, finds himself tossed into a strange place called Regency England where he lands nearly in the lap of a most luscious female specimen. He decides this smelly world that offends all of his senses might not be quite so bad after all!<br />Lilac Devere was minding her own business when a handsome cat enters her carriage and settles in like he owns it. Despite her Aunt's warnings she takes this arrogant creature home and gets much more than she bargained for.<br />Rejar is a familiar from the futuristic planet Aviara. He's a descendent of a race of people who can change into the form of a cat whenever they wish. Along with their shape changing abilities familiars also have heightened senses, telepathic powers and extraordinary sensual appetites.  However, once they meet their life mate and become bonded familiar's have an unshakable sense of devotion and never stray (remember this is a fantasy, folks :).<br />Rejar observes life on this strange planet and quickly learns that the only way to survive the brutal scrutiny of the ton is to create a persona they will fawn over. Using his powers of suggestion, he convinces Lord Byron that he is a Russian Prince and quickly becomes the most sought after man in Regency England.  He's a man all of the women want but he is only attracted to the one whom he curls up with each night.  The one who believes he is nothing more than a cat. But, arrogant fellow tha the his, he knows once she meets him in the flesh she'll fall head over heels in love with him.<br />Needless to say he's in for quite a shock when Lilac gets rip roaring mad and slaps his handsome face when he innocently states his intentions to \\"have\\" her. This only makes Rejar all the more determined to make her his. After all no woman has ever refused him! Just what kind of planet has he landed on?<br />When he realizes that Lilac is fated to be his life mate and he comes to the realization that he isn't winning her over with his stunning sex appeal he tries every trick he can think of to win her love.<br />Dara Joy has created a magnificent hero with Rejar.  Anyone who has ever been owned by a feline will certainly understand and laugh out loud at his arrogant demeanor. His compassionate nature won my heart and while I didn't always agree with his tactics I realized he just couldn't help his sexy self.<br />The only problem I had with this story was the heroine. While Rejar was a well rounded character I found Lilac to be rather self-centered and uncompromising. The girl also had no curiosity. I think a hero as wonderful as Rejar deserved better.  But, hey, maybe I'm just being catty. In Lilac's defense, I did enjoy her openness which made for some great laugh out loud scenes.<br />I really enjoyed REJAR for its bawdy and tender humor, scorching sensuality and unique storyline and highly recommend it to those searching for something a little different from the norm. Although this is a sequel it is not necessary to read the prequel, Knight of a Trillion Stars, first (although it is a spectacular book!).

Zafiro and her wacky gang are hiding from the law and a madman who wants to kidnap Zafiro.  You see, she possesses the ability to sense danger.<br />Sawyer Donovan stumbles upon the hideway and is nearly murdered by Zafiro's pet cougar.  Zafiro fears Sawyer is a threat to her *family* and decides that he must die.  It's a darn shame he just happens to be the most gorgeous creature she's ever laid eyes on.  Instead of killing him outright she takes him prisoner.<br />What follows made me laugh out loud.  This book contains some of the most hilarious scenes I've read yet.  The *snake* scene is priceless. What I love most about Paisley's writing is that while she has the rare ability to make me laugh she can also make me cry buckets with her tender characterization and gut wrenching scenes. Her many characters are well drawn and add charm (as well as laughs) to the story. I enjoyed and never became annoyed by all of these wacky, wild characters.  Zafiro is a lovable nut and Sawyer is a wounded soul that is absolutely to die for. I give this one my highest rating and highly recommend it!	2002-12-16

The Howard's & Peregrine's have been at war over land for years & both families have suffered tremendous losses.<br />Tearle Howard, raised by his Mother, is an innocent in this war & wants nothing more than to see the bloodshed come to an end. When he first sets eyes on Zared, who for her own safety had been raised as a boy, he decides he wants her as his own (somehow he realizes right off the bat that she's a girl though no one else can). In Tearle's arms Zared comes to realize there is more to life than training & fighting and she starts to enjoy being a woman. But because Tearle carries the Howard name Zared can never trust him completely.  When her brothers discover Tearle's identity all hell breaks loose.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a cute read that isn't immediately put off by that old \\"girl raised as a boy\\" theme. Though it wasn't what I'd call remotely emotionally intense it was lots of fun. I liked Tearle who had a great sense of humor & wasn't afraid to admit he was lazy (whatta guy!). He was a refreshing change when compared to the harsher personalities of Zared's brothers. The scenes where Zared is pining over all the gorgeous young hunks while dressed as a boy really cracked me up. I had a few minor problems with the hero kissing the heroine upon their 1st meeting & then again with the kissing every time he ticked her off but the heroine handled this great. Actually, I kind of felt bad for the poor guy after awhile because he must've been one hurting sucker!	2002-12-16
US	52186522	R3JQ0SO52AU89Y	0441009867	869734328	Vampire Sextette	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A mixed bag of vampiric treats.	The first story, The Other Side of Midnight by Kim Newman, gets off to a slow start and never fully recovers.  It is a mishmash of several elements but is basically the tale of a Genevieve, an ancient female vampire, who spends her time as a private investigator in Hollywood.  She runs into Orson Welles who, in this alternate universe, is working on filming his version of Dracula.  Orson hires her to check out the mysterious man financing the film.  During the investigation she gets an inside look at the making of vampire porn (nothing too explicit though, darn it!) and meets up with the hilarious Barbie and her Overlooker (if you are a fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer you will want to read the story for these priceless moments alone).  There are many descriptive passages about the filming process which might have interested me if I were remotely interested in Orson Welles or in the process of making a film but sadly it was all wasted on me.  Though it had its moments this 88 page story seemed much longer to me and I admit to skimming in order to get Barbie's next appearance.<br />Some Velvet Morning by Nancy Collins was more to my liking.  This story features a witch with a rather icky beauty secret.  In order to rejuvenate her youthful good looks she must bathe in fresh human blood.  Her victims are horny (and nearly always married) males easily tempted with a promise of sex made by a beautiful woman.  In my opinion this type of guy deserves everything he gets so the comeuppance, though gory, was quite entertaining for me.  Vampire Sonja Blue, Nancy Collins famous vampire-slayer, is hot on the trail of the blood witch because she, unlike myself, does not believe the witch should be allowed to continue her public service work.  Though this story slightly disappointed me near its end it was fast-paced, violent and an enjoyable little read if you are in the mood for nastiness.<br />Sheena by Brian Stableford was my favorite of all of the stories.  Tony Weever is your typical young customer service-drone spending his working hours placating angry customers while surrounded by a group of venomous young female co-workers whom he does his best to avoid.  Sheena is the exception.  She is a loner and is rumored to be a goth who is too weird to date.  Tony is intrigued and begins a tentative friendship with Sheena that slowly turns into love.  Tony will do anything to please Sheena and initially feigns interest in her darker lifestyle but quickly becomes entranced in her world of music, past lives and vampirism.  This is a lovely but bittersweet story of love and loss that sways towards the melancholy but remains hopeful all at the same time.  It also beautifully combines the threads of music and sensuality while painting a unique picture of vampirism.<br />Vanilla Blood by S.M. Somtow begins smack dab in the middle of a sensational court case involving the bizarre killing spree of one young man.  It is a pretty blatant spoof of the over-the-top cases that were recent at the time the story was written (OJ and the like) and it is pretty darn funny in an extremely morbid and often juvenile, sex-obsessed sort of way.  The story is written from the point of view of several key witnesses.  My favorite was the sex obsessed best friend of the murder suspect who tends to go off on sexual tangents while telling the story that led up to the murders.  This may not be the best written story I have ever read (for instance, two of the teenage witnesses are written in the same exact \\"voice\\" and I couldn't distinguish one from the other) but it has lots of sex, lots of blood and, most importantly, it made me laugh several times.<br />My least favorite of this collection is Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's dull entry titled In The Face of Death.  The story chronicles the days Madelaine de Montalia, the so-called vampire of the piece, spends in the arms of her married human lover William Sherman.  Initially, the two fight their bizarre attraction to each other (bizarre to me because there is nothing particularly attractive about either of these people) but of course they succumb to the temptation.  The remainder of the story consists of scattered kisses, romps and slight feelings of guilt.  Interspersed within the story are Madelaine's journal entries which only cement the fact that she is one of the most mind-numbingly boring vampires I have ever come across.  She writes in excruciating detail about such interesting subjects as house hunting and financial matters.  Worse, even, is the fact that there is no blood letting, no sexual tension, no violence, absolutely zero character development and darn it, there is not even a good old fashioned brood going on here!  This story may as well of been about two regular unlikable dullards ~ there is no need at all for the vampiric angle.  As much as I love an old fashioned love story, this one was so uninteresting what with its tedious plot and flat characters that I could barely get through it without skimming.  Sadly, the only thing going for it was its short length.<br />Finishing up the sextette is Tanith Lee's odd, atmospheric tale called The Isle Is Full of Noises about an author obsessed by a man who has ignored her for decades.  She gets her revenge by writing him into all of her books.  His fictional character suffers hardships and usually comes to a painful and untimely end.  Yse's current vampiric novel becomes a big part of The Isle Is Full of Noises and is interesting, if a bit slow moving.  Somewhere along the line Yse's fantasy and reality begin to merge and I found the end result quite puzzling and a little vague and, as a result, this story was not one of my favorites.izarre to me because there is nothing particularly attractive about either of these people) but of course they succumb to the temptation.

The Dirty Little Boy is a children's story about a very dirty little boy who so very badly wants to get clean. He asks his dimwitted mother to bathe him but she's too busy doing laundry (scrubbing by hand, mind you!) and asks him to go watch the animals and learn how they clean themselves (can you imagine?!).  The boy does as he's told and ends up getting dirtier and dirtier as the story advances.<br />My son was able to read this story easily and felt very proud doing so but tired about half way through and asked me to finish.  Each page contains a large paragraph of text and it was slightly daunting for a brand new reader even though the words were very simple.  He enjoyed the story and all of the little drawings on the bottom corner of each page and had a good laugh at the silly, not-too-bright boy.  He laughed at the \\"big, round mother\\" whose, eh hmmm, rather large floral covered bottom is shown quite prominently.  I was less than thrilled with this (and I'm 5'3, 110 lbs) but he's six and, of course, thought it was all quite hilarious.  Maybe I've just lost my sense of humor.<br />The final page, showing a clean, proud unclothed little boy cracked up my son because he tends to make a big to-do once he's clean too and despite the overall dated feel of the story he did manage to relate to parts of it.  Overall he mostly enjoyed \\"The Dirty Little Boy\\" but his attention drifted midway (as did mine) and we won't be adding this one to our personal library.	2002-12-12

This is a creepy, dreamy little nightmare of a tale written for the young adult market. I bought the unabridged audiotape version read (quite dreamily, I might add) by author Neil Gaimen.  Coraline is a lonely young girl with endless energy and a keen sense of adventure.  Her parents have recently moved into a huge home that has been converted into several apartments and Coraline has been having great fun discovering all sorts of nifty things on the grounds of the home.  One day a storm arrives and Coraline is forced to stay inside with only her busy (and somewhat neglectful, if you ask me) parents for company.  They instruct her to leave them alone, to go on an adventure around the house and to bother the neighbors.  So Coralina does and discovers a door to a secret, sinister world that at first glance appears to be very much like her own.  In this world she has another Mother, one with black button eyes and long twitching fingers!  This is an interesting dark fantasy that I didn't think was predictable at all.  Coraline is a smart, spunky little girl who, when faced with the ultimate temptation, is forced to make a very grown up decision.  I liked this one lots and can't wait to listen to it again.	2002-12-12

I was excited to begin this book for my local romance readers group because I'd heard many positive things about author Christine Feehan and the book appeared to be a new twist on the beauty and the beast theme (one of my personal favorites).  Sadly, things didn't work out between me and author Christine Feehan (too much melodrama for me) and now I'm weary of beginning her vampire series (most of which I already own).  Somebody please tell me this book was fluke!<br />Isabella is a beautiful, headstrong young maiden (aren't they all) who sets out on adventure to save her brother from the clutches of a very Eeevil man.  The one man who Isabella believes can help her is Don DeMarco but, most unfortunately, he is reputed to be a cursed man and is apparently feared by all.  Undaunted, our brave little heroine makes the treacherous trip to Don DeMarco's lair, a trip that has felled many a stronger man before her.  Safe at the lair she meets Don DeMarco and can't figure out what the fuss about him is all about.  So what if he's a bit broody, he's gorgeous!  He agrees to help her with conditions attached (which I won't reveal unless you force me).  She then takes up residence in his home.  At night she hears spooky, ominous sounds in the night.  She wanders about and makes dense decisions and faces down deadly lions (which seem to roam the home freely) while the people surrounding her begin to act all nutty.  As the story advances lots of spooky and ominous stuff happens.  Over and over again!  None of it going anywhere or advancing the plot.  During all of this repetitive madness Isabella and the cursed man (or is he?) begin to fall in love.  Or that's what we're supposed to believe.  Personally, I didn't buy it.<br />Initially I was hooked by the setup of the story, despite what I thought was an abundance of overly flowerly descriptive prose, a tendency towards the melodramatic and an annoying smattering of Italian words.  But by page 70 my patience and excitement to turn the pages quickly began to wane.  Extreme lack of character development (not to mention the over-the-top writing) did me in.  I never felt like I knew any of these characters and when several of them acted oddly it didn't seem all that weird to me because for all I knew this was how they acted normally. The love story is also weakened by the lack of character development.  The couple bounce back and forth between trusting each other wholly, falling into bed, having hot sex and then, when it's all over, they're back to distrusting each other. Ahhhhhh!  I have no patience for this sort of thing and was soon bored of these two.  Sadly, all of these problems continued until the anti-climatic end.<br />So, folks, are the vampire books similar in style??n the pages quickly began to wane.

Year of Wonders is a book I would never have picked up if left to my own devices.  I tend to steer clear of too true-to-life accounts of death and despair.  Having recently joined a new readers group, and this being the first official selection, I felt duty bound to read it from cover to cover.  And I'm glad I did.  Sort of.<br />The story is all about the Black Plague and its effect on the inhabitants of a small town that decides to close itself off in order to avoid spreading the disease.  The story concentrates on a young woman who endures more loss and grief than it seems one person should ever be forced to bear.  But bear it she does.  As the plague spreads, it brings with it fear and superstition, and brings out the worst in her neighbors.  Startling secrets come to light as many of the inhabitants of the small town succumb to the plague.<br />The book is extremely believable, the characters act realistically and the book moves along at a brisk pace up until its last quarter.  As the book progresses the secrets and plot twists become increasingly over-the-top and it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief and my interest began to wane.<br />I did find most of the book utterly fascinating but can't say that it was a pleasant reading experience.  The plague and all of its ugliness are described in living detail and I read with a continuing sense of dread.  Still, this story is one of the few that really made me sit back and appreciate my life.	2002-12-10

How could one resist a chubby, goofy little green monster who constantly gets himself into trouble?  I certainly can't and neither can my two kids.  The Huggly books were some of the first books that my children requested me to reread (and their collection is quite huge) and they never seem to tire of them.  Today my young son (who is just learning to read) brought home my personal favorite \\"Huggly Gets Dressed\\" to read as a homework assignment and I got to view it from a new perspective as he read to me.<br />In Huggly Gets Dressed our favorite little green monster who lives under the bed of the \\"people child\\" sneaks out to have himself an adventure.  He discovers the people childs clothing drawer (actually he bonks his head on the drawer and knocks the clothing on his head) and has a heck of time trying to figure out how these clothes things work.  Just when he thinks he's got it all figured out he hears a knock on the door!  Oh, no it's the people child's mother!!  Huggly tries to run and hilarity ensues.<br />The text was easy enough for my son to read without getting thoroughly frustrated but it was also challenging enough to make him stop and think through a few new words.  He laughed aloud at the hilarious drawings of Huggly which are funny even when viewed for the tenth time.  I recommended this for kids of all ages but especially those between four & seven.	2002-12-10

Meredith's Wish, by new romance author Karen Lee, did something many books by seasoned authors have failed to do in recent months: entertain me. In a genre currently over saturated with interchangeable suspense laden plots and annoying or boring characters Meredith's Wish was a welcome breath of fresh air.<br />Meredith is a hard working young woman hell-bent on attaining a vice presidency position. She figures she has the promotion nailed but her boss has other ideas and decides to have a little fun by turning the job opportunity into a contest. Now she has to play beat-the-clock with her rival and secure a contract from an eccentric client who will only deal with married woman. The trouble is, Meredith is as single as they come with no prospects in sight. Frustrated beyond belief she weeps into her cell phone and, handily, out pops a hunky genie to answer all of her prayers.<br />Okay, so I never said this was a realistic story, did I?<br />Jim has been a naughty genie and has only thirty days to prove to the Chairmen of the Genie Board that he is a useful addition to genie society. Meredith is his final task and if he fails to grant her heart's desire he will cease to exist. Her wish to find true love is, unfortunately, one of two that he is unable to grant so he is forced to improvise. And his improvisation results in some very hilarious situations and blind dates.<br />Personally, I'm bone tired of grumpy, bossy, brooding heroes. I can't stand `em in real life and am finding them terribly difficult to stomach in my pleasure reading. Jim, much to my relief, turned out to be quite the opposite of the typical romance hero. He's fun-loving, lives to create mischief and has a terrific sense of humor. He never takes himself seriously and perfectly complements practical and workaholic Meredith.<br />Meredith's Wish is cute but never cloying and single-handedly pulled me out of a depressingly long \\"bad book\\" slump. It's not a perfect book though. The conflict is as light as they come and, as a result, the story loses momentum at the midway mark. Still, this weakness is easy to overlook because of the good humored hero and the sense of fun that permeates the story.<br />I can easily recommend this to any romance reader tired of the same old stale story-lines overcrowding most bookstores. Karen Lee is an author with a fresh new voice who clearly knows that romance can be sexy and fun. Ahhh, if only all debuts were this charming!ht as they come and, as a result, the story loses momentum at the midway mark.

Unfortunately, the story got caught in that classic old rut of \\"I want you but I'm not sure that I even like you!\\" and I quickly got bored.<br />Anyway, the movie star hero with the \\"baby blues\\" is named Treet.  How cute.  And Treet's big burly bodyguard is cleverly named Brutal.  It's here that I begin to whimper.  Anyway, Treet, our oh-so-fine looking movie star hero is a loving father whose baby was involved in the big baby mix-up.  But he doesn't know it until the heroine comes into his life quite a few years later.<br />This causes a big upheaval in both of their lives since they love their girls' and do not want to break up their families.  The solution?  Move into Clint Eastwood's ranch so they can all get to know each other and become one great big smiling, happy family.  Can you imagine?  But things don't go quite as smoothly as Big Blue Eyes intended because of Hayleigh's foul temper and penchant for flying off the handle with the littlest provocation.  But somehow they manage to fall deep in commonplace lust that they mistake for everlasting love.<br />Me and my limited store of patience did not enjoy this book.  The plot was highly improbable, the characters generally self-centered and/or unlikable and the humor fell flat.  On the plus side the book was written in an easy to read style and the pages did zip by.  Still, I was left feeling nearly as grouchy as the heroine when I turned the last page.	2002-12-06
US	52186522	R3TV5R5ZO9KWKJ	0505524899	557403040	George & the Virgin	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A romantic comedy that is actually funny!!	I was (and probably still am) pretty much burned out on romantic comedies when I picked up this book for my local romance readers group.  Though it sounded funny and the reviews were positive I figured I'd end up disappointed by the end.  Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />George & The Virgin is a time travel/fantasy that begins somewhere in the Middle Ages (the period remains sketchy) in a small village filled with superstitious weaklings who sacrifice one of their virgin daughters to the local dragon once each year (because they're apparently too pathetic and spineless to face him down themselves). As the story begins Alizon (a 14 yr old virgin) is desperately trying to rid herself of her virginity with a loathsome and clueless boy in order to avoid becoming the dragon's next dinner. The scene is quite bawdy and funny and shows that Alizon is strong willed and very mouthy.<br />George, the hero of the story, lives in modern times. He's a professional wrestler for a foundation similar to the WWE (or whatever they're calling themselves these days) and is sent back to Alizon's time by his new age sister.  George has always fantasized about slaying a dragon and now his dreams are coming true.  Unfortunately, poor George isn't quite up to task and faces quite a few mishaps during his adventure.<br />I turned the pages eagerly but must admit that midway the author began to lose me a bit and the story seemed to drag (too much padding, maybe?).  Still, I give this one a high recommendation.  George was a great guy possessing lots of heart, self-doubt and he even had a conscience!  Alizon was a bit on the prickly side but she had plenty of reasons.  I can easily recommend this to someone looking for a break from the same-old plotlines filling the bookshelves.  It's over-the-top fun and sexy too.  What more do you need on a boring snowy night?	2002-12-06

The text is simple and repetitive which made the book easy for him to read and caused very little frustration (though a few of the words were new to him).  The story is about a group of jolly mice dressed for Halloween.  They're dancing, eating and having a great old time until a cat decides to crash the party.  They then devise a way to scare off the cat so they can continue their fun.  Gotta love 'em.  The drawings are fanciful and spooky without being too scary for little ones.  My son loved the final page and said he'd love to read it again.  The book gets 5 stars for that comment alone!	2002-12-05

He enjoyed reading this (with help from me on the big words) and was pulled in by the vibrant photography and grossed out by some of the facts (the egg sacs in particular). I asked him the questions presented in the story but he was too worn out to answer them.  Still, we both learned lots of interesting new things about spiders.  Did you know that some spiders have 8 eyes?  I've seen the picture to prove it! Another highlight was seeing a close-up of an intricate zig-zag spider web & another very messy web.  Wow, it'll almost make me think twice before shooing the critters out of my house & destroying their webs.  I'd recommend this for a 6 year old boy or girl interested in bugs.	2002-12-05

After getting through half of the book in only two nights I found myself under whelmed but the pages flew nonetheless. I figured out the identity of the killer in chapter 9 (the first 1/4 of the book) and typically I'm pretty clueless about these things. The subject, child abduction, really bothered me and the scenes with the children in pain (both emotional and physical) were hard to stomach and weren't something I prefer reading about in detail.  I think it has something to do with the amount of description, pain, suffering and gore. This is definitely *not* a book I would have finished I hadn't committed to it and I'm not in any hurry to read the sequels.	2002-12-05

October Dreams:  A Celebration of Halloween edited by Richard Chizmar & Robert Morrish is a collection of new and previously published short stories, novellas and true-life memories taking place on Halloween, also included is a brief (and interesting) history of Halloween and guides to Halloween film and fiction all written by some of my favorite horror and dark fantasy writers.  And if you think that's a mouthful you should see the size of this book . . .<br />I've been working at this one for over a month and not due to disinterest either (for a change).  This sucker is HUGE and its anthology format makes it the perfect book to pick up and put down whenever the mood strikes.  I feared I'd overdose on Halloween stories if I read a big chunk of it in one sitting so I've been savoring it.  Fortunately, the stories were, for the most part, strikingly different.  Since the list of stories alone is three pages long a blow by blow synopsis of them by me simply isn't going to happen.  Instead I'll do my best to highlight the stories that lingered in my memory for one reason or another.  Most of the stories range from good to excellent but there were a small handful that bored me enough to give up halfway through (a rare thing considering the size of this tome).  The tone of the stories runs the gamut from mournfully sad to laugh out loud funny but the thing that the majority of these stories have in common is the lack of gore and sex and the reliance on atmosphere and good old fashioned storytelling to chill the bones.  Here goes:<br />Dean Koontz story \\"The Black Pumpkin\\" begins this tome and is a creepy little tale about a decent and good little boy and his Eeeevil big bully of a brother.  The two come across a spooky old man who has a talent for carving pumpkins into malevolent creations.  Big brother picks out the ugliest scariest pumpkin in the bunch (naturally) and brings home much more than a spooky pumpkin.  This story is a spooky-ooky but not terribly original tale about bad folks getting their comeuppance.  I liked it.<br />\\"Mask Game\\" by John Shirley is about people and their nasty little secrets and it had me reading way past the point of exhaustion the other night.  Unfortunately it got a bit cluttered and more than a bit confusing towards the end and, well, I fell asleep.<br />\\"Gone\\" by Jack Ketchum takes a look inside the life of the weird woman who lives down the road, the lady all of the neighbors whisper about.  It's an affecting and sad tale about a woman's attempt to celebrate Halloween after a long stint of hiding away from the world and anything involving children.<br />Two other standouts for me were Richard Laymon's \\"Boo\\" and Douglas E. Winter's \\"Masks\\".  \\"Boo\\" tells the tale of a young group of trick or treaters in the mood for a little fright.  They end up getting much more than they bargained for when a stranger joins their merry little group.  It's the stuff nightmares are made of and reminded me a bit of a warped Twilight Zone episode.  Delightfully dark ~ I loved it.  \\"Masks\\" is both an emotionally gripping and terrifying glimpse into the life of a young boy struggling with personal loss and a step-mother from hell.  Written with a relentless sense of impending dread this story shook me up.<br />Sandwiched between the works of fiction are true life stories of the author's Halloween memories.  Most of these I enjoyed even more than the fictional tales.  Might it be because I'm nosey and enjoy indulging in a bit of literary rubbernecking?  Probably.  But knowing that all of this creepy, odd and sometimes very funny (or very sad) stuff really happened made these pages fly.  Growing up shy and traipsing from house to house in my cheesy store bought costume with my dad and (also shy) younger sister made my Halloween outings a relatively boring affair.  These true life walks back in time about tricks gone awry or funky handmade costumes fascinated me and have inspired me to be a bit more creative this year.<br />Also included is an informative short history of Halloween and its origins, a handy list of must see Halloween movies with interesting synopsis for each that had me rushing to Blockbuster to find the gems I've missed (few of which they carried I might add) and then there's a guide to Halloween reading for those who feel the need for more after gobbling up this book.<br />Overall this is one of the best collections I've come across and it comes highly recommended to those looking for the ultimate in Halloween reading.r />Also included is an informative short history of Halloween and its origins, a handy list of must see Halloween movies with interesting synopsis for each that had me rushing to Blockbuster to find the gems I've missed (few of which they carried I might add) and then there's a guide to Halloween reading for those who feel the need for more after gobbling up this book.<br />Overall this is one of the best collections I've come across and it comes highly recommended to those looking for the ultimate in Halloween reading.	2002-12-05

It is chock full of &quot;issues&quot; and  overcoming and/or dealing with those issues and it really was not a  satisfying romance for me - nor did it involve me emotionally.  Because of  the subject matter, and the books many subplots,  there was little room for  the typical romantic tension and the enjoyable banter that so attracts me  to the romance genre.  Neither character truly came alive or  &quot;grabbed&quot; me the way a memorable romance couple does and their  past &quot;episodes&quot;, scattered throughout the book as they were,  weren't as effective as they should have been because the reader wasn't  privy to much of what was going on in the characters heads at the time.  The hero's attempts to control his anger were presented in a believable way  but in the end I was left feeling very uneasy about the couple's future -  and especially for their future children.  For me &quot;The Burning  Point&quot; was a disappointment and a mostly uncomfortable reading  experience that I won't be repeating any time soon.	2000-06-23

She longs for family ties, for roots, and most importantly for love.  When she finds her mother's old trunk and discovers a letter  that hints at the location of her father she drops everything and heads  straight for Kentucky.<br /> Katherine is searching for a map when she nearly  collides with a trailer and meets a very unfriendly Zach Taylor.  Zach is  furious at Katherine's reckless driving and gives her an earful.  The  trailer she nearly hit contains his horse, Midnight Rogue, who he believes  will win the Kentucky Derby.  Despite his anger he stays with her until a  tow-truck arrives.<br /> Their attraction is immediate but a relationship  seems to be an impossibility because Zach refuses to risk his heart after  he was left at the altar by a woman he loved.  He has no room in his life  for a woman, he stubbornly insists.  He only wants to win the Derby, own  his own stud farm and live a quiet simple life without all of the  complications that love is sure to bring along.  Lucky for us he falls  hard and fast for Katherine.<br /> I tend to favor relationship driven novels  about people who genuinely care for one another as opposed to those books  where the couple spend the book calling each other nasty names and then  immediately hop in the sack.  That's why I enjoyed &quot;Almost Home&quot;  so much.  The relationship between Zach and Katherine begins with a lusty  attraction that gradually deepens into a friendship and eventually develops  into love.  It's clear to see that these two down-to-earth people genuinely  &quot;like&quot; each other and aren't mistaking infatuation with love.  The end result is an intensely satisfying love story.<br /> If you're in the  mood for a slower-paced, feel good romance that isn't plagued by the  unnecessary subplots that are far too common in contemporary romances give  this one a try.	2000-06-23

When she was sixteen she fell in love with a handsome, smooth-talking dude who promised her the world and instead left her heart and reputation in tatters.  Jessye  believes that she is unworthy of a husband and a family of her own because  of her past.  She dreams of becoming independent from men and making her  way on her own.  This is why she agrees to finance a half-cocked idea  thought up by two Englishmen to round up cattle and deliver them eastward.  They guarantee she'll make a fortune and since she knows more about cattle  rustling than the Englishmen she goes along with them on the cattle drive.<br /> Harrison (Harry) is the second son of an earl sent by his father to  Texas to clean up his act.  Because of his past Harry believes he is  incapable of love and spent his youth drinking, gambling, and driving up  huge debts. Harry believes he is indeed the scoundrel he presents to the  world but deep down lurks a kind, generous and even insecure man.  Because  Harry doesn't enjoy working any harder than he has to he intends to make  this cattle venture a success.<br /> Harry is strongly attracted to the  outspoken Jessye and turns on the charm full-blast in order to get her into  his bed.  Although Harry tempts Jessye (he is gorgeous after all) she turns  him down and tells him flat out that he will never get her in his bed until  he can offer her his heart - the one thing that Harry knows he can never  do.<br /> The two spend most of the book doing all they can to avoid  falling in love.  Harry because he believes he simply can't love and Jessye  because she refuses to give her love again.  These two characters are very  wounded souls and have multiple layers to their character which is exactly  what I've come to expect from a Lorraine Heath novel.  But because Harry's  reasons for holding out were not explained fully or early enough his  refusal to admit that he was falling in love exhausted and frustrated me.  I guess I've just burned out on the stubborn &quot;I don't have a  heart&quot; hero.  A terrible accident occurs about half way through which  adds more fuel to Harry's refusal to love Jessye but it also makes him a  much stronger man.  This section was written believably and with much  compassion.<br /> Jessye is an admirable heroine who has had to make a  heartbreaking choice and her reasons to avoid love were much more  understandable than Harry's.  There is a subplot involving a little girl  that was just way too coincidental for me to believe but I was able to over  look it because it did create some painfully emotional scenes and added  much to Jessye's characterization.<br /> &quot;Never Love A Cowboy&quot; has  a good mix of action and emotion and is definitely worth a read.  It  managed to move me to tears and made me smile in quite a few places but it  is not my favorite Lorraine Heath novel.  I reserve that spot for TEXAS  DESTINY.d me.

There is a subplot involving a little girl  that was just way too coincidental for me to believe but I was able to over  look it because it did create some painfully emotional scenes and added  much to Jessye's characterization.<br /> &quot;Never Love A Cowboy&quot; has  a good mix of action and emotion and is definitely worth a read.  It  managed to move me to tears and made me smile in quite a few places but it  is not my favorite Lorraine Heath novel.  I reserve that spot for TEXAS  DESTINY.	2000-06-20

Molly a widow and a nurse by profession wakes one morning to find an unconscious and injured man on  her property.  She takes one look at his dark features and realizes that  he must be an immigrant farm worker (in the country illegally) who was  likely injured during a raid the previous night.  She is contemplating  calling the deputy when he lets out a heartrending cry for his lost  &quot;Josefina&quot;.  Molly decides to use her nursing skills to heal his  wounds rather than turning him in.<br /> As Molly heals Alejandro and  searches for Josefina, who is his eight year old niece, a tender and  sensual romance blossoms between them.  &quot;A Rio Grande Marriage&quot;  is a little category romance that is jam-packed with more emotion and  sensuality than can often be found in a 350+ novel.  Although there is a  secondary issue that is handled a bit too easily for comfort I'm betting  you'll love this one if you enjoy a character driven romance about lonely,  vulnerable people.	2000-06-20

If you're feeling blah and want a good laugh - along with a wonderful romance - you can't get better than this!<br /> Kate Svensen is thirty-five, gorgeous and has a  successful career.  She's the kind of heroine we all love to hate.  But  wait a minute this is a Crusie heroine after all and not your standard  perfectly coifed heroine.  Not at all.  Kate may be more successful than  most of us ever dream of becoming but she's also insecure and more than a  little bit unhappy.  Her job bores her, her breasts are starting to droop  and she's given up on love after dating a string of losers who only want  her for her money.  Despite this Kate still wants a husband, a compatible  husband who is as successful and driven as she is.  And what better place  to find him than at an exclusive golf resort catering to singles?<br /> But  instead of meeting a decent hard-working man Kate only finds more losers at  the resort.  The trip isn't a total bust however because she does meet Jake  and the two strike up an instant friendship.  Jake is beautiful and they  have a ton of fun together.  But he's also totally unmotivated, admittedly  lazy, and just about the slowest moving person Kate has ever come across.  He's so not what Kate is looking for.<br /> Jake had been married to a  cold, self-centered woman and now wants to settle down with a nice, dumb  bimbo who thinks he's the end-all be-all of her world.  Definitely not  Kate.  But the two are honest with each other and begin spending a lot of  time together because they believe they are &quot;safe&quot; with each  other.<br /> All their well-laid plans are blown to shreds when love takes  over and then the fun really begins!<br /> Manhunting is a classic Jennifer  Crusie tale filled with humorous situations, tons of witty dialogue that is  simply about two people who love spending time together.  The conflict is  believable and never feels contrived and the book doesn't get weighed down  with subplots.  There are a few great secondary characters who add to the  fun but never take over the spotlight.  &quot;Manhunting&quot; is the book  to choose if you need a quick &quot;pick-me-up&quot;.et weighed down  with subplots.

But Night Whispers was just a bit too preposterous for even me to buy into.  And, it didn't help that the love story was one of those love/hate fests that I so abhor.<br />  Noah Simmons became a ghost when his greed and ignorance led him to his  death.  He's been trapped within a cave for over a hundred years when  botanist Liz enters his quiet little world.  Noah falls deeply in love with  his &quot;Lizzie&quot; the moment he spies her and spends the rest of the  book watching out (and making trouble) for her and the hero.  Meddlesome  Noah is the only thing that I enjoyed about this book.<br /> Liz is part of a  &quot;BioCave&quot; experiment and will be cooped underground for six  months.  But, in order to participate, she must be married.  You see, the  millionaire financing the project is a bit of an eccentric and believes  that only married couples can make the project a success. Liz doesn't have  a spouse or even a significant other (of course!) and since she has spent  most of her career preparing for this project she decides to propose to her  colleague Ethan even though she despises him.  He is cold and arrogant and  has basically made her life miserable.  And, believe me, his attitude does  not improve once they begin to share a bed . . .<br /> I could easily  overlook this ridiculous and contrived plot setup if the love story had  been enjoyable but, for me,  it wasn't.  The couple were not sympathetic  characters.  They spent most of the book ogling each other, ignoring each  other or arguing.  Both had a serious aversion to &quot;love&quot; because  they were brought up by cold parents, the poor babies.  They really needed  to get over themselves and do some growing up but it did not happen.  They  also had a foolish, and very annoying, &quot;big misunderstanding&quot;  keeping them apart that only served to compound my frustration with the  pair of them.  All these two really needed to do was sit down, have a  decent conversation and all of their relationship woes would have been  solved.  Instead they duke it out until nearly the last page.<br /> There  were other troublesome plot devices and a totally lame  &quot;monster&quot;  that made this book very difficult to stick with.  After enjoying this  author's previous book UNFORGETTABLE because it  was sexy and a lot of fun  and featured two characters who were good friends,  NIGHT WHISPERS, with  its combative relationship was a huge disappointment.wn, have a  decent conversation and all of their relationship woes would have been  solved.

Werewolves are one of my favorite subjects to read about and I've come to despise books where they are solely portrayed as the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  &quot;The Passion&quot; paints them as extraordinary creatures and I loved  the author for that.  They have faults, tempers, and an unbelievably  arrogant attitude but are also capable of great compassion and undying  love.<br /> The story opens upon a grisly scene.  Three werewolves have been  brutally slain and werewolf Nicholas Devoncroix intends to destroy the  human responsible.  This forces his father Alexander to share with  Nicholas a painful secret from his past.  The story than jumps back in time  to Paris 1897 and the story of Alexander and Tessa begins.<br /> The first  half of the &quot;The Passion&quot; reads a lot like a light-hearted  regency romance between an innocent but &quot;feisty&quot; heroine and an  arrogant hero.  Human Tessa LeGuerre carries out her plans to murder  Alexander Devoncroix while he sleeps.  But her plans are foiled when the  gorgeous man's wounds begin to heal right before her eyes.  Alexander is a  bit peeved but mostly amused by her failed attempt at murder and begins to  interrogate her.  When he learns the source of her pain the two form an  emotional bond that brought me to tears.  Alexander then introduces Tessa  into the mysterious world of the werewolf and it causes all sorts of messy  consequences and power struggles within the werewolf community.  This  portion of the book is often humorous and witty but then it takes a drastic  turn and becomes a compelling and painful adventure/horror story filled  with heartbreak, survival, and strength.  The world the author creates is  vivid and carefully drawn and her characters are people you come to love  despite their faults.<br /> This isn't a book that ties up everything in a  nifty little bow because it is the first in a series.  I also can't stress  strongly enough that &quot;The Passion&quot; is an _extremely_ emotionally  draining book and is at times terribly bleak.  However, it is hands down  the best werewolf book that I've read and I can't recommend highly enough.

Brite collection	\\"Are You Loathsome Tonight?\\" is a little pricey for such a small volume (185 pages) but as a big fan of Poppy Z. Brite's work I felt it was worth  splurging on.  Why?  Because I got a quickie update on two of my favorite  lovers, Trevor and Zach from \\"Drawing Blood\\" who, as she puts it, are still  in \\"happy, disgusting, perfect love\\" - that short story alone was worth the  cost of the book for me.  Other highlights were \\"King of the Cats\\" a sweet,  kinky, imaginative retelling of the fairytale \\"The Poor Miller's Apprentice  and the Cat\\", \\"Self-Made Man\\" is another favorite because I can't seem to  resist a good graphic zombie/cannibalistic tale, and \\"Saved\\" was another  stand-out that is both violently erotic and terribly sad.

Sarah Calhoun, a reporter, sniffs a career making story in the works when the bed is rolled straight to  bachelor Jack Donovan's ranch.  Jack, you see, has been making lavish  purchases for his home and has been throwing money around like it grows on  trees and Sarah just knows he is up to some sort of sleazy business.  But  the irritating man will not give her an interview and has foiled all of her  attempts to extract information from him.<br /> Jack is amused by Sarah's  persistence and only a little annoyed and decides to try a new \\"diversion\\"  method by kissing her senseless and then abruptly pulling away when she  starts to respond.  He then insults her by explaining that he pulled away  because although she'd be a great \\"roll in the hay\\" she would never make  him a fine wife.  She's far too hot-tempered and strong willed he goes on  to say.  Well, Sarah is incensed!  Imagine the nerve of the arrogant jerk!  She manages to reign in her temper and instead decides to get even by  writing an article all about Burr's wealthiest bachelor Jack Donovan and  his quest for a bride.  After the article is printed woman are  propositioning poor Jack at every turn.  Being a red-blooded man he eats up  the attention but soon tires of it when he realizes that sassy Sarah is the  only woman for him.  He then spends the rest of the book trying to win her  love.<br /> This is a such a great book.  It has humor and a fun plot but its  greatest strength is its characters.  You won't find any stereotypical  people here.  Jack and Sarah are well developed characters who are likable  right off the bat and the secondary characters are equally well rounded and  entertaining (and they never take over the story!).  Jack has a dark and  dangerous past but doesn't walk around sulking about it.  Instead he has a  terrific sense of humor and a big heart.  I _so_ loved Jack.  Sarah also  has darkness in her past but hasn't turned into a grumpy spinster because  of it.  She has a sensual and loving side that fits so well with Jack's  personality.

If you're in the mood for a moving romance (and a good cry) this book is a great choice.<br /> Finnea Winslet grew up wild and free  in Africa under the loving guidance of her father.  When her dad dies  Finnea is left all alone and must travel to Boston to meet the mother who  deserted her nineteen years earlier.  She is told that a fellow American  named Matthew Hawthorne will accompany her safely home while she rides the  dangerous African railway.<br /> When Finnea first meets Matthew he is  rude, threatening and does his best to scare her senseless but fails.  Matthew only wanted to be left alone and is amazed that Finnea doesn't  flinch when she glances at his facial scar.  Finnea sees it as  &quot;character&quot; and isn't bothered at all by his blustery attitude.  When the train derails Matthew spends a harried night watching over Finnea  until help arrives.  When Finnea wakes Matthew is gone before she can thank  him and she believes she'll never see him again.<br /> A few months later  Finnea is in Boston trying hard to fit in and learn all of the ridiculously  stifling rules that a proper lady must follow when she meets up with  Matthew again.  He saves her from embarrassment during a dinner party and  she decides then and there that he will teach her how to become a proper  Boston lady.  She does not care that he craves solitude.  She is relentless  and he soon caves in.<br /> What follows is a very satisfying romance between  two tortured souls.  And I do mean tortured.  Both Finnea and Matthew have  deep emotional wounds and many trials to overcome before they find their  happy ever after.  This is an angst filled read but it never became  overwhelmingly depressing because of the gentle humor interwoven into the  story.<br /> This book would have received five stars but I did feel a bit  cheated because a pivotal scene that occurred in Africa was not included in  the book - only alluded to throughout the story.

Finally, I've found myself another series to covet that contains some of my favorite things: magic, fairies, vampires, a likeable hero and just the right mix of humor, action and gore!<br /> Harry Dresden's like a lot of  us.  He struggles to pay his rent, his love life bites, he lives with a cat  and his wisecracking attitude often lands him trouble.  Oh, and he just  happens to be a wizard and shares his basement with a talking and  meddlesome skull named Bob.<br /> Harry makes his living doing things like  helping the general public find their keys and/or lost spouses and also  works with the local police department on their \\"weird\\" cases.  Just when  things are looking really bleak money-wise Harry's business starts to pick  up in a big way.  He's asked to investigate a gruesome double homicide on  the same day that he receives a call from a woman willing to him pay big  bucks to locate her husband.<br /> During Harry's investigation he calls in  help from a cool little fairy named Toot-toot and draws the attention of  the White Council - a group who exist to ensure that magic is not misused.  Years earlier Harry disobeyed one of their laws and had the \\"Doom of  Damocles\\" placed upon him and if he is caught using black magic again, no  matter how dire the situation, he will be put to death.  And, as if all  that weren't nerve-wracking enough, Harry has also ticked off a mob boss  and a vampiress!<br /> This is a fast-paced, action packed read that I didn't  just couldn't put down because Harry is such a likable guy.  He's a true  good guy who you really want to see win.  His terrific sense of humor  remains intact whether he's facing down a bloodsucking demon or going  through one of life's most humiliating (and extremely humorous) dates.

Three horses under her care have died under mysterious circumstances. It appears that someone is trying to put her Uncle's ranch out of business and they've got to find  out who and why before another innocent animal dies and their reputation is  shattered.<br />When Tory walks into Cole Bannister's office and requests his  investigative services he initially turns her down. After three terrible  tragedies that he holds himself responsible for he refuses to get involved.  But against his better judgment he does.<br />This is a romance, so it's no  surprise that the culprits are found and the two fall in love but first  they have to overcome a lot of personal baggage. Cole is drop dead  gorgeous, so the heroine despises him on sight. You see, her Dad was a  beautiful, lying, sack of doggy dung who was the worst kind of womanizer.  With only her dad as an example Tory believes all pretty men are ugly on  the inside. So she's scared to death of her attraction to Cole and fears  she's following in her doormat Mom's footsteps and fights it for all she's  worth. Completely understandable. Cole, naturally, is much more than a  pretty face but he'd like the world to see him that way so he hides his  painful emotions and only dates air-heads who don't care if he has  feelings. In his mind any decent woman is too good for him. He has a lot of  healing to do and personal demons to face before he can love with all of  his heart. He's a classic wounded hero.<br />Tory loses her baggage sooner  than Cole does, he carries his around for the entire story. A bit too long  for my tastes. I wanted to see them both happy and in love for a few more  pages than I got. This is what would be classified as a very angst-filled  read. Fortunately, there were quiet moments of humor to relieve the  tension; Cole's cat, whom he denies is his, made me smile and brought out  Cole's gentle side early on. His vehement denial of ownership is justsuch  a man thing that I couldn't help but laugh every time the cat popped  up.<br />A Justine Davis book is always a treat and I recommend this one,  especially for those who like wounded characters and loads of internal  conflict, but if you're not quite up to reading 240 plus pages of angst you  may want to hold off on reading this one until another day.	2000-05-27

Expectations that disappointingly were not met  once the story really got going.<br /> Major Lord William Fizpatrick is sick  of war and death.  After his best friend Val dies in his arms he resigns  his commission and heads home.  But first he makes a pit stop to see  Louisa, Val's widow, to bring her the letters she'd written to Val.  In  those letters Louisa had vividly described her happy home life and Will,  who never had a happy home of his own, fell just a little bit in love with  her.<br /> Louisa wasn't honest in her letters, though, and she and Val had  had anything but the idyllic love life that she hinted at in her letters.  Val left Louisa and their young daughter Pip in dire straits and Louisa  only wrote the letters in an attempt to soothe her pride and to make Val  feel a little guilt at his desertion.  As a result of her doomed marriage  Louisa has hardened her heart and become quite grumpy.<br /> When Will  arrives she mistakes him for a handyman she so desperately needs.  Will  becomes tongue-tied by her beauty and pretends to be a handyman named \\"Will  Cutter\\".  He sees this as a chance to become free of his past and longs to  spend more time with Louisa.<br /> This setup was often emotional and held  much promise but the romance that followed did not live up to its  potential.  Louisa is a screechy, unbendable and mostly unlikeable heroine  right from the get-go.  She is desperate to keep Will at arm's length and  spends most of the book treating him to harsh, uncalled-for  tongue-lashings.  After a few of these outbursts I was really shocked when  he decided to stick around.  But stick around he did, and emotionally  abused he was.<br /> Will was a great hero, and the sole reason that I  continued to read the story.  He's kind and has a fantastic sense of humor  that really comes in handy when he's dealing with Louisa's red-hot temper.  Louisa eventually warm up and the plot takes a temporary turn for the  better.  The story becomes entertaining, moving and highly sensual for a  bit but then things begin to slide downhill again.  Several annoying plot  twists occur including a frustrating and simple to resolve  misunderstanding, a catastrophe where Louisa acts in a embarrassingly  pathetic fashion and a three-month long separation that occurs near the end  of the story.<br /><br />Despite the plot contrivances and irritating heroine  this book had some genuinely touching moments, some way better than average  love scenes and a beautiful spiritual element.

This book fits both scenarios but, much to my surprise, I couldn't tear myself away  from it.<br /> Rosa is married to Digby, a sickly, older man, who has been  unable to impregnate her.  When Digby dies their home will pass into the  hands of a nephew who belongs to a fanatical religious cult.  In order to  prevent this Digby  encourages Rosa to find herself a handsome young man to  get her with child.<br /> Sheltered Rosa loves Digby but he's always been  more of a protector than a lover.  When she was seventeen she was gravely  injured and her face was scarred.  Digby saved her life by proposing  marriage.  Because of her scars she has been living life as a hermit and,  although she is frightened by Digby's request, it reawakens her adventurous  nature and she agrees to his plan.<br /> So Rosa dons a mask and heads to a  masquerade ball to find an &quot;easy&quot; man.  But the men she meets  repulse her and she decides to head back to the safety of her home.  This  is where she finds the hero who is laying unconscious in the middle of the  street.  She brings him to a friends' home and nurses him throughout the  night.  When he awakens he has no memory but is so grateful to the still  masked Rosa that he offers her payment.  She's very attracted to him and  impulsively decides to ask him to make love to her and he agrees.  During  their time together something unexpected happens -- they fall in love.<br />  What follows is a very sensuous love story written with wry humor  about two wonderful characters caught in an impossible situation.  I ached  for them and was not turned off at all by the adultery plot because of the  way it was presented and because all of the characters involved were warm,  loving and kind people.  I couldn't tear myself away from this love story  until the last quarter when the couple faced a necessary separation and an  intrigue subplot took over center stage.

Sweet Tea and Jesus Shoes is a charming collection of stories that range from sweetly sentimental tear-jerkers to laugh out loud funny slice-of-life tales.  And, best of all, there isn't a dud in the entire bunch.  All of  the stories were obviously written with love and each is an author's memory  of living in the South.  The book is broken up into three sections titled:  Precious Memories, Family Portraits (wow, do these ladies have some nutty  relatives and neighbors!) and Beloved Critters.  Being an animal lover the  &quot;Beloved Critters&quot; section contained some of my favorite stories  in the collection.  The hands down winner for me was Donna Ball's UP JUMPS  THE DEVIL.  It's about a big, slobbering, affectionate dog that sends an  entire town into an uproar and gives one grasping old bitty her  comeuppance.  This story had me in stitches and will be reread whenever I'm  in dire need of a good laugh.  The book is a little pricey, at $14.95 for  only 171 pages of storytelling, but I feel its stories are worth splurging  on (or saving for).	2000-05-18

It's a bit light on conflict but features one of my favorite romance plot lines:  two childhood friends who  rediscover love.  Also helping this story along was the fact that the  couple were regular, down-to-earth people and not super model heiresses and  millionaire playboys.<br /> The heroine's mother died when she was a child  but because she loved her husband so deeply her soul remained alive and she  returned to him in the form of a ghost.  She will not find eternal rest  until Kate finds her true love.  Kate's parents scheme to bring her back  home to the man they believe she is destined to love.<br /> After receiving a  very strange phone call from her father, Kate returns to her hometown to  make sure that he's not losing him mind.  The first person she encounters  is Luke Rodgers, the man who broke her heart many years ago when he moved  away and ignored her letters.  Kate is now engaged to a man she doesn't  love because she can't bear facing that type of hurt again.  When she sees  Luke all the old feelings return.<br /> This is where the really weak  conflict kicks in.  Luke and Kate grew up together and were closer than two  peas in a pod.  When they were twelve Luke moved away, never to be heard  from again.  Because of this devastating loss at the ripe old age of  twelve, neither has been able to trust themselves to love again and both  have shut off their emotional wells.  I really wasn't exaggerating about  the weak conflict bit, was I?<br /> Despite that plot quibble I did enjoy  this love story very much.  The book concentrates on the couple as they  rebuild their relationship and never gets off track or bogged down by  extraneous subplots.  This is one couple who plainly enjoy each other's  company and it was refreshing to read.  The love story between Kate's  parents was also well done and very touching.<br /> If you're looking for a  sweet, old-fashioned love story and are tired of villains who take up too  much of the plot you'll want to give this book a try.old-fashioned love story and are tired of villains who take up too  much of the plot you'll want to give this book a try.	2000-05-18

In  just two weeks she will be wed to a man whom she does not love - a man who  plans to keep her away from her work to make babies and keep his house.  Amy longs for love but will not hurt her father by backing out of the  unwanted marriage.  One day Colin Chase &quot;Earl of Greystone&quot; walks  into her family's store and they make an immediate connection but, sadly,  he is far out of her league.<br /> These first few chapters are wonderful and  really hooked me.  The historic details are interesting and plentiful and  Amy is presented as a likable and compassionate character full of life,  dreams and motivation.  Then a devastating fire destroys her life and  changes everything.  She now has the opportunity to take charge of her life  but first is rescued by Colin who takes her to his home so she can heal  from her physical and emotional wounds.  She quickly finds love and  acceptance amongst Colin's siblings but receives only the cold shoulder  from Colin who wants her gone as soon as possible.  Amy decides she wants  Colin and comes up with one excuse after another to stick around.<br /> It  was Colin's attraction to Amy that impelled him to rescue her and it is  that same attraction that makes him want her out of his sight as soon as  possible.  Colin is betrothed to a &quot;titled&quot; woman and has already  spent a good portion of the woman's dowry and sees no way to get out of it.  And, lets be real, he doesn't want to.  For the majority of the story  money and titles are more important to Colin than love and it's here that  the book lost the most of its appeal for me.<br /> Colin and Amy are wildly  attracted to each other and obviously belong together but he stubbornly  refuses to break off his betrothal.  This makes him come across as  extremely selfish.  Amy deserved so much better.  Amy, unfortunately, loses  some of her charm because she is forced into the role of pining away for  the stubborn Colin instead of concentrating on getting back on her feet.  The jewelry crafting, which was such a huge part of her life, takes a back  to seat to thoughts of Colin and this was very disappointing.<br /> This  story is a good choice if you like your books steeped in historic detail  and don't mind love-stubborn heroes.  The author has an obvious love for  her time period and weaves in interesting tidbits whenever possible.  Although Colin didn't turn out to be my idea of a hero I do look forward to  the forthcoming stories about Colin's siblings who were lovable characters.y selfish.  Amy deserved so much better.

I hadn't read the  previous books and found these people to be nothing more than a huge  distraction because they did very little to enhance the love story.  But,  if you're a fan, you may love seeing these people again.<br /> The main story  focuses on Olivia Darling, a grumpy spinster who spent her best years  tending for an ailing aunt  who thanked her by berating her and destroying  her confidence.  Now that the horrid aunt has finally died Olivia is free  to live her life the way she chooses.  Sure that her childbearing years are  well behind her she has given up on her dreams of love and family and has  instead purchased a boarding house in Springwater.<br /> Olivia's first  boarder is Jack McLaughlin, a secretive civil-war survivor looking for a  quiet place to rest.  These two lonely, wounded souls make an immediate  connection but Jack's past haunts him and until he finds peace with himself  he is unable to give his heart to Olivia.<br /> Jack makes this often  predictable book worth reading.  He is simply a wonderful hero who really  leaps off the pages.  If you have a soft spot for wounded heroes you'll  love Jack.  Olivia, on the other hand, wasn't as easy to like.  She takes  the &quot;prickly&quot; heroine to a whole new level and often behaves like  a crabby granny rather than a thirty-two year old woman.<br /> Although I  wish the author had toned down the constant interruptions made by the  secondary characters this was still a better than average romance - all  because of Jack.  I recommend it with caveats to readers on the lookout  for a warm and sweetish Americana.	2000-05-16

She doesn't want or need a man around because they've only caused her heartache and decides to become  artificially inseminated.  After her procedure she is emotionally strung  out and ends up in bed with her best friend Derek.  They proceed to act out  of character and have unprotected sex three times which, of course, sets up  the conflict when Sydney becomes pregnant.<br /> Before they became intimate  Derek had been working up the nerve to tell Sydney that he was in love with  her but held his tongue fearing he would lose her friendship.  When her  pregnancy is confirmed he doesn't care that the baby may not be his and  proposes marriage.  She does care and flatly refuses.  Derek, a scientist,  then decides to &quot;woo&quot; her using a scientific approach that has  some funny results.<br /> During his &quot;wooing&quot; Derek proves to be a  loving, patient and very persistent guy and I was rooting for him all the  way.  Sydney takes the &quot;men are scum&quot; bit too far, especially  when it is revealed that they've been best friend's for twenty-two years  but it was fun watching Derek attempt to win his woman.<br /> I really  enjoyed The Seduction of Sydney.  It was entertaining, sexy and satisfying  and because it was obvious that the couple enjoyed being together and had  much more in common than a simple case of lust.  And, best of all, it was  exactly what a romance should be:  romantic!	2000-05-16

Inside its pages you'll find a hard-hearted hero with a tragic past and a spunky heroine who tries her hardest to not only be one of the boys but to be *better* than the boys  (usually failing badly and proving herself incompetent).<br /> Camille  (otherwise known as Cam) wants to run her father's farm to make up for a  tragic accident that she caused years earlier.  When she discovers that her  father (very wisely) has decided to hire a new foreman she explodes and  demands that she be given a chance to prove that she is worthy of the job.  Her father gives them a month to prove can do a better job of it.<br /> Cam  and Wade set the pages on fire with their sexual tension but because both  are extremely hot-tempered they battle it out to nearly the last page.  They argue, they kiss, and then they argue some more.  Wade wasn't what I  consider \\"hero\\" material by any means either.  He's too bossy and his past  didn't exactly win me over to his side, nor did his love for visiting bawdy  houses win him any points with me. Cam fared a little better.  She does  pull some incredibly naïve and ridiculous stunts but has a wicked sense of  humor that made me grin on more than one occasion.<br /> There is nothing new  in Prickly Pear and although it contains some very irritating plot  developments it also has some amusing and moving moments....	2000-05-13

When she comes-to she finds herself in a strange new  world with a hunky man leaning over her performing some sort of ritual.<br />  King Daken, a healer, was actually performing a communication spell.  When  she refuses to obey his most simple of commands and injures herself in the  process he heals her and creates a bond between them that intensifies their  already raging hormones.<br /> What follows is an enjoyable fantasy story  that deals with a tough issue as well as a sweltering, and often funny,  love story.  Most futuristic/fantasy romances don't work well for me.  They  either get so bogged down with futuristic mumbo-jumbo that it sets my head  to spinning or the world is so poorly constructed that the book becomes  laughable.  And, most unfortunate, these books usually forget that a  romance, of any kind, needs to always keep the romance development at the  forefront.  This book doesn't fall into any of those traps.<br /> The only  flaw, and it's a pretty noticeable one, happens midway through the story  when the heroine makes a totally ridiculous decision about another man.  When you get to this section do yourself a big favor and skim!  It has no  place being in this otherwise fantastic book.  Fortunately, the book  quickly recovers from this misstep and the romance gets back on track and  all ends exactly as it should.<br /> I highly recommend this to futuristic  romance fans who demand a decent plot along with a lovely and entertaining  romance.	2000-05-12

This love story contains neither scenario.  What it does contain is a healthy and loving relationship based upon years  of friendship and trust.  This is exactly the type of love story that I  love most.<br /> Police Office Josh has been love in with Paige for ages but  it was his best friend Anthony who won her heart and her hand in marriage.  He has since settled with becoming Paige's good friend and has kept his  unrequited love for her a secret.  When Anthony is murdered and Paige's  life is put in jeopardy Josh risks not only his life but his heart when he  goes under cover, posing as her lover, to keep her safe.<br /> The mental  anguish facing both of these characters is deftly drawn and makes them both  very easy to empathize with.  Both behave like adults throughout the story  and neither are arrogant fools (like far too many romance characters) and  can admit when they are wrong.  I really liked that about these two.  Josh  is simply one of the kindest romance heroes that I've come across, wearing  his heart on his sleeve but he never losing his sexy &quot;edge&quot;.<br /> While the romance is strong the same can't be said for the secondary  suspense subplot and the dull, stereotypical villains.  Fortunately, this  subplot never overshadows the romance because the couple remain together  throughout it. If you're in the mood for a tender love story between  friends you shouldn't miss this one.	2000-05-11

But that's not really the case here.  The onlymagic that happens concerns two dijinn (genies) who are actually a thoughtless King and Queen who were imprisoned in a slave bracelet by a distressed wizard.  Supposedly whenever the jewels on the bracelet are rubbed the King and Queen are released and must serve the &quot;rubber&quot;.  Amazingly, though, when the slave bracelet is found by the hero of the story's young serf, and he rubs the jewels just like he is supposed to, the dijinn are released but pop right back in to the bracelet without offering the youngster his wishes! This allows the bracelet to conveniently end up in the hands of the heroine who, of course, gets her wishes.  I understand this is a paranormal romance and that &quot;weirdness&quot; is bound to happen but, really, when an author sets up a set of basic rules they should be consistent.  This inconsistency was an obvious and huge boo-boo that should have been caught before the book hit publication.  This type of confusing rule-bending only served to annoy me right off the bat.<br /> What follows is pretty much a standard medieval tale about a young, innocent maiden whose greedy father's machinations ruin her reputation and force her into the arms of the warrior hero.  If you like your heroes wounded you'll like Connor.  I did.  He's broken in spirit and body and only wants to live out the rest of his life in peace and quiet.  But due to further scheming he becomes betrothed to Alura and they fall immediately in lust.  Or is it love?  I was confused because the two actually spent little time together.  With so many subplots happening around them they barely had time for a conversation.<br /> Alura's Wish wasn't the `magical' tale I was lead to believe and it didn't engage my emotions but it did manage to make me grin a time or two.  Those who like lots of adventure mixed in with a lust driven romance may well love it.adventure mixed in with a lust driven romance may well love it.	2000-05-09

Because of this, her nasty uncle has kept her captive and beaten and starved her.  When she discovers that he plans to sell her to a wealthy barbarian she risks her  life and escapes.  The remainder of the book concentrates on Regeane's  self-discovery and the other, often odd, sometimes depraved people she  encounters.  She's known she can shapeshift but she also learns that she  has visions and can speak to the dead.  Eventually she becomes embroiled in  a dangerous political situation and meets her soul mate and all ends pretty  happily ever after.<br /> This book, set in Rome during the Dark Ages, is  rough, meaty and often very dark.  It's not a book for everyone because the  author gets really graphic and vividly describes numerous vile acts  including torture and assorted bodily functions.  The book also goes off  into tangents when the numerous secondary characters take center stage but  their stories were interesting even though they rarely advanced the plot.  My mind only started to wander during the times when the book got into  heavy political details - which aren't my thing.<br /> If you can get past  all that, and don't mind a highly descriptive book you'll find a very  interesting story that is often (at the most unexpected times) very  hilarious in a morbid kind of way.  I found this story, for the most part,  very difficult to put down and am looking forward to the sequel which I  hope ties up some loose ends.	2000-05-08

It's been bugging me ever since I read the book.  The blurb clearly states (in a rather large font)  that &quot;When it comes to matters of the heart, you can always trust your  friends.&quot;  Well, let me get all clich&eacute;y on you and say with friends  like this the heroine would have better off trusting her enemies!  Her  so-called friends betray her and stab her in the back at every given  opportunity.  Please do *not* go into this book expecting to find a warm,  friends-y romance because you will be sorely disappointed.  Well, you have  been warned.<br /> So let me get down to what the story is *really* about.  Cira Valentino is a beautiful but dirt poor Sicilian peasant who boards a  ship with her family and hopes to start a new life in America.  At Ellis  Island she is turned away by a health inspector because her eyes are all  puffy from crying over leaving one of those so-called &quot;friends&quot;  of hers.  Forced to head back to Sicily she hitches a ride, nearly gets  raped, and is saved by the hero - Thatcher Montgomery - a very rich, very  spoiled blue-blooded American.<br /> This begins their relationship.  And  it's a bumpy one.  Thatcher is destined to marry an equally blue-blooded  American or he faces becoming cut-off from his cold-hearted family.  So  they spend a lot of the book falling in love but resisting their feelings  because they are &quot;unsuitable&quot; for each other.  Cira becomes all  defensive and snippy while Thatcher harbors fears that Cira may only be  after his money.  This type of behavior carries on for most of the book  and, in my eyes, the only thing they had in common with each other was a  bad case of lust.  They finally open up at the end of the book but it was  far too late and I was left feeling really uneasy about their future  together.<br /> The setting is done fabulously well but sadly I can't say the  same about the characters and their on-again/off-again relationship which  had me gritting my teeth more often than naught.say the  same about the characters and their on-again/off-again relationship which  had me gritting my teeth more often than naught.	2000-05-05

Author Elizabeth Massie captures the feel of &quot;Buffy's&quot;  world so well that I could clearly see the characters come to life in my  head.  Although I did find the normally conversation challenged Oz to be a  bit wordy here at times.  He's the quiet sexy one (the perfect man ;) but  he seemed to have quite a bit of dialogue in this story and it stuck out.<br /> This one is an original novel (not a novelization based on a TV  episode) about a young girl with a dictator-like father who is totally fed  up with his attempts to run her life and prays to the &quot;goddess&quot;  for help.<br /> Then a new library administrator, Ms. Moon, and her two  too-perfect-to-be-true girls arrive in Sunnydale and quietly begin to stir  up discontent between the sexes.  Soon the female students are carrying on  about &quot;inequality&quot; and &quot;injustice&quot; and, much to  Cordelia Chase's dismay, are rallying around the Moon girls who have become  the most popular students in school.  The guy's aren't immune either and  walk around in a dazed state blindly worshipping the Moon sisters.  Even  poor Giles is affected.  Momma Moon wants to do away with all of his  &quot;weird&quot; books and even though he finds the idea offensive his  brain gets muddled and he begins to pack them.  Buffy catches him in the  act and realizes that someone is once again up to no good in Sunnydale and  she intends to stop it.<br /> I saw where this one was going immediately but  that's okay because reading it was *almost* as much fun as watching a Buffy  episode.  There's a little wit, there's Slayer action and there's lots of  hanging out with the Buffy gang.  Worked for me.	2000-05-05

Somewhere In The Night is a short, gripping read if you like your romances on the &quot;gritty&quot; side.  I don't.  Still, I mostly enjoyed this one because it features an easy to root for heroine and the suspense doesn't  overwhelm the romance (my big peeve with the romantic suspense subgenre).<br /> Bridgett  is cursed with precognitive clairvoyance and sees glimpses of  impending crime scenes.  She hasn't had a vision in five years, since the  night she was nearly beaten to death and raped by a vicious serial rapist.  When her visions return she calls the only man who can help her -- the  police officer who wasn't able to arrive in time to prevent her rape.  Chad  is conflicted when she calls him.  He feels great guilt at his past failure  but answers her call because of that guilt. They begin to work together and  struggle to overcome past hurts all while trying find a killer before he  strikes again.<br /> Chad was an okay hero but he had a penchant for walking  away from emotional entanglements that really rubbed me the wrong way.  And, his excuse of being &quot;a confirmed bachelor&quot; was annoying in  the extreme and made me groan aloud.  He grows up but it takes too long and  poor Bridgett has enough to deal with without adding in his adolescent  behavior.  Still, this was a decent read and should satisfy fans looking  for a suspenseful romance.<br />I gave this one a B- at All About Romance.	2000-05-04

At least most that I've read.  Two of the stories are painfully average, one is good with the final being outstanding.  Few authors can create a full fledged love story  in less than 100 pages and as a result most of these left me feeling less  than satisfied with the too rushed outcome.<br /> Lynn Kurland's &quot;And  The Groom Wore Tulle&quot; is a good story if you're looking for a laugh.  It's about a 1313 Scotsman who time-travels to 1999 (just don't ask me how  because I still can't figure it out).  He meets the heroine who immediately  takes him home (hey, this is a short story so things have to move  unbelievably *fast*).  The heroine is of the doormat variety and the story  is light on logic and romance development but nonetheless it's still a fun  read.<br /> The Con &amp; the Crusader by Maggie Shayne doesn't fare quite so  well.  It's about a con man who gets flung back in time (this time at least  it's explained!) and saved from life in the slammer when the heroine  rescues him by offering her hand in marriage.  She quickly proceeds to turn  this criminal into a hardworking family man.  Sorry, I just didn't buy his  quick reformation and Jack was just too smarmy to fit my idea of a hero.  This one is my least favorite of the anthology because of its  predictability and over-the-top sweetness.<br /> A Bride Most Common by Angie  Ray starts out great but peters out by the end because it becomes  overstuffed with plot threads.  Lucy gets sent back in time by her kindly  old boss to correct an error.  She awakens holding the hand of a regency  hunk and quickly discovers that she's no longer in her own body and is  married to the dude!  Like I said, this one starts out great with lots of  wit and charm but quickly becomes bogged down with other less interesting  stuff and I lost interest.<br /> Conyn's Bride by Ingrid Weaver is my  favorite.  The heroine, an antiquities dealer, finds a gorgeous Celtic  bracelet in one of her shipments and can't resist slipping it on her wrist  and, boy, does her life ever change for the better!  Suddenly a gorgeous  man appears professing his undying to love to her.  He insists he's been  traveling far and wide to find her and that she is long lost bride.  She's  excited (who wouldn't be?) but soon learns that he's only bumped his head  _really_ hard and is more than a little bit confused.  Or is he?  This  story works on all levels and is simply charming.  It's very romantic,  super funny, sensual and may even evoke a tear from a few readers.in one of her shipments and can't resist slipping it on her wrist  and, boy, does her life ever change for the better!

Christmas Fantasy is the book to read if you're looking for a fun series romance with lots of emphasis on the developing romance (imagine that!) and excellent sensual tension.  And, best of all it isn't filled to the brim with kids and/or boring subplots.  As far as plots go this one is pretty  flimsy but it's a load of fun and worth sticking with.  Teddy (the heroine)  has made up an imaginary boyfriend to get a lecherous boss off her back and  now must find a man to be her pretend boyfriend for her company's Christmas  party.  The only suitable male that pops to mind is a male stripper she  met on her birthday.  Austin had decided to retire from the stripping  business and is concentrating all of his energies on making his landscaping  business a success.  But when Teddy lays out her plans he readily accepts  because he'd been unable to get the sexy lady out of his mind.<br /> Of  course their playacting turns into the real thing and they both fall deeply  in love.  Austin makes a great hero, he's sensitive and even a bit  insecure.  Teddy, on the other hand, is almost too confident to warm up to  but together they heat up the pages.  I found this book nearly impossible  to put down.	2000-05-02

This anthology contains stories by Evelyn Crowe, Lorraine Heath, Vivian Vaughn and Eileen Wilks -- some fine writers indeed.  Unfortunately,  the stories are all average (or below) and center around the heroine's  attempt to &quot;tame&quot; their cowboy.  That's all fine and dandy and  truly I have nothing against a sexy cowboy being tamed by the love of a  strong woman.  BUT because of the length of each story none of these  heroines succeeded in making me believe that all had ended happily ever  after.  I could even picture two of these couples spending a lot of hours  in divorce court a few years down the road.<br /> This is certainly not a  bad book, the authors create some witty repartee and fun situations and  even tug on the heartstrings a little, but it isn't a book I'd call  satisfying.  The plots and characters were not fleshed out enough and this  greedy reader wanted more (especially of the Lorraine Heath story which  introduced two wonderful characters)!	2000-05-01

She has to overcome a tragedy from her past that has haunted her her entire  life. I am still amazed (a week later) at how Ms. Phillips handled two  serious issues and still manage to create a laugh out loud book.<br /> The  hero is a wonderfully arrogant, funny, and sexy guy who's looking for  &quot;a baby making, bread baking, good loving woman&quot; (not exact quote  but close) to settle down with but gets Phoebe instead. I loved this book!  It made me cry and laugh and I actually didn't mind learning something  about football!<br /> For all you animal lovers: There's also a doggy named  Pooh (poodle) who gets into all kinds of trouble in Chapter One. I also  hate poodles but again Ms. Phillips managed to make me like this one (g).	2000-04-29
US	52186522	R1RE6W1HRVNWG0	0064404773	611302574	Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Gorgeous storytelling	This is a retelling of the classic fantasy Beauty and The Beast. But this version has a bit of a twist, McKinley's &quot;Beauty&quot; doesn't quite live up to her nickname and can be more accurately described as an awkward teenager, a girl who prefers to spend her free time with books and horses.  I liked her immediately. When her Father accidentally stumbles upon the  bewitched castle of the &quot;Beast&quot; he is forced into a promise that  will forever change Beauty's life. To give anymore of the plot away would  be to ruin the magic of the book.<br /> BEAUTY is categorized as a children's  book (10 and up) but I think it will appeal to anyone who loves a magical,  sweet, old-fashioned love story. McKinley's characters are well-drawn,  sympathetic and just plain lovable, right down to Beauty's charming horse.  This was another one of those rare &quot;unputdownable&quot; books for me.  It's a keeper and one I intend to read to my babies when they're old enough  to sit still long enough to enjoy it.	2000-04-29

I absolutely loved this story about a whimsical fairy princess who is destined to marry a human in order to save her race from possible  extinction.<br /><br />Splendor, the fairy princess of Pillywiggin, is thrilled  to learn from her Father that Jourdian, the Duke she has been admiring  &amp; watching over since childhood, is the chosen human to sire the first  half human/half faery child. All Jourdian ever wanted was a plain, boring  wife, one who would bear him children and cause him no trouble. Then  Splendor and her magic enters his life and Jourdain's safe orderly world is  suddenly turned upside down. The only hitch is that Splendor only has three  months to convince Jourdian to marry her and conceive before she must  return to Pillywiggin or else she may die . . . unless she convinces  Jourdian to fall in love with her.<br /> This is a magical story that put a  smile on my face and had me laughing out loud. Splendor's innocence and  antics are adorable, sometimes silly and always hilarious, I've never read  another heroine quite like her. Anyone who loves a pure romantic fantasy,  lots of humor and a sensual love story should read this ASAP.	2000-04-29

This book is *not* for everyone. It has a very dark tone &amp; the first few chapters are very painful to read. Your heart will be ripped to pieces several times before the book ends. BUT despite all of this I found it to  be a very uplifting story of triumph &amp; love. I didn't just read this  book I lived it.<br /> It is the story of Princess Lissar, who at first  glance appears to live a charmed life. Actually, once we dig a little  deeper we realize Lissar is very alone &amp; isolated in her world. Her  parents don't seem to remember she exists, she has no friends only  servants. The turning point begins when her Mother dies and she receives a  puppy as a gift of condolence from Prince Ossin whom she names Ash. Dear  old Dad, crazy with grief over the loss of his Queen, turns into a nutcase  &amp; completely forgets he has daughter for several years. During this  time Lissar &amp; Ash grow up together &amp; become bonded closer than any  two beings can be. Then one day Dad remembers he has a daughter &amp;  decides it is time for her to marry &amp; start producing an heir. Once he  takes a good look at Lissar he notices how beautiful she has become &amp;  how much she resembles her mother. I don't want to give anything else away  but this is the beginning of Lissar's transformation into the mystical  creature Deerskin &amp; the end of her life as she knows it.<br /> Despite  the dreary beginning, this story is ultimately a positive one &amp;  especially recommended for dog/animal lovers. The scenes with the puppy  rearing, Lissar's eventual opening up to Prince Ossin &amp; the magical,  mystical qualities of the story make this a must read. Lissar is a heroine  to admire &amp; Prince Ossin is a ray of light in a world filled with  selfish, spoiled &amp; revolting men. Lissar's dog Ash is the glue that  holds her together through good times and bad.<br /> So, if you're up for an  emotional read that is well worth the pain put a day aside to read this one  &amp; make sure you have a box of Kleenex handy. You're guaranteed to cry  tears of pain &amp; of joy. This one unquestionably gets 5 out of 5 stars.l read that is well worth the pain put a day aside to read this one  &amp; make sure you have a box of Kleenex handy.

They're good friends and as  they grow a little older they become attracted to each other and both are  looking forward to the day when they'll be wed. When Patrick returns home  after a sixteen year absence, scarred, tired and heartsick (he's been off  fighting a war), he finds Marsali betrothed to another and their families,  who've always been great friends, are now at war. After secretly meeting  Marsali, Patrick figures out that something fishy is going on and sets out  to find the culprits responsible for the family feud. All the poor, weary  man wants is peace and his Marsali back but he'll have neither until he can  force two stubborn old men to face the obvious truth.<br /> This was an okay  read but not a keeper. I loved the opening of the book, it really hooked  me, but somewhere along the line the original magic got lost. It didn't  seem to me like the hero and heroine spent all that much time together,  possibly because there was always so much going on around them. Because of  this I just didn't get a chance to know or feel anything for the  characters. It's not that they were unlikable or annoying, they just didn't  engage me. They were beautiful, brave and honorable but they weren't all  that original or special and were almost a bit on the &quot;too  perfect&quot; side. And the dialogue (after the first few chapters) just  didn't move me - I didn't laugh or cry. Also, I knew where the story was  leading very early on because I was told who the bad guys were and exactly  what their whole fiendish plot was about so the following war/adventure  story was a bit of a chore to get through. And the last thing I wasn't  crazy about was the heroine's pet ferrets. I thought they were unnecessary  because they didn't provide any humor, and although they did help bring out  Patrick's sensitive side, I felt they weren't necessary for his character's  growth. They were portrayed as snippy, temperamental creatures without much  allure. I've said before that I wish there were pets in every book but in  this case they were more of any annoyance than anything. And I like  ferrets! My Mom has a cute, shy, little guy who has never snarled or bit  anyone. All this stuff combined made for a very slow read.<br /> There were  things I did like about this book (or else I never would've finished it).  I'm a real sucker for a Scot's accent and I always like a strong warrior  who still manages to retain his sensitive heart and this story had plenty  of both. And I'm sure you'll like this book if you're really into  action-adventure &quot;me &amp; you against the world&quot; plots and don't  mind near perfect characters. There was nothing offensive about it, it just  wasn't my cup of tea. I think this just confirms something about my tastes,  I'm not crazy about action-filled romances UNLESS the characters wow me  with their charming personalities. Only a selected few have managed to work  for me because the adventure almost always overwhelms and ruins the love  story for me. Some I can think of that worked were: Diana Gabaldon's  OUTLANDER (although I stopped there, couldn't get into the 2nd one),  Justine Dare's FIRE HAWK and Patricia Ryan's SECRET THUNDER.bit of a chore to get through.

I started this book with really low expectations. I was expecting to hate it or at least to dislike it. Why? I read this author's previous book LOVE GAME which was supposed to be erotic, hot and something special. I found it to be thin in plot and  characterization and I didn't much care about the love scenes. I think I  was expecting too much because it was so highly touted. I put off reading  this one for a year and almost traded it in unread on the basis of that one  disappointment. I am so glad I didn't!<br /> Eva Campbell, a lonely virtual  reality whiz, conjures up her perfect dream man. A man who lives to fulfill  her every fantasy (whew, great premise, huh! ) She's been hurt deeply by  her cheating snake of an ex-hubby and has very little self esteem. Her  gorgeous creation, Urich, gives it back to her. But she fears he only  worships her and thinks her beautiful because she's programmed him to think  that way. Little does she know that he is not at all what he seems and his  feelings come straight from the heart. He has secrets and an agenda all his  own that could tear their fragile and forbidden love apart at the seams . .  .<br /> This book was a little hard to get into at first. The premise is a  bit bizarre but once I got into the story and got to know the characters I  couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I can't lie. There were a few things  that bugged me a little bit; the heroine's personality went through a  drastic change in a real short span of time, she changes from an insecure  workaholic into a strong, woman confident of her sexuality in what seemed  like a matter of days, she also acts immaturely in spots (especially when  she's mad) and the hero holds a secret for too long. Usually these things  will turn me off in a book but somehow they didn't bother me all that much  and I know why. I absolutely loved the hero in this story. I don't want to  say too much and spoil his secret but he was really original and loving,  sweet, sensitive, not to mention beautiful, faithful, and best of all he  shed tears! He really made the book for me.<br /> I don't think this is a  book for everyone though, it was a bit on the bizarre side and you really  need to suspend disbelief to thoroughly enjoy it. Although the sexual  tension was steamy with a capital S and the love scene really worked for me  I don't think those who dislike paranormals would appreciate the oddness of  it. But if you like your books hot, love sensitive heroes and are looking  for a very different type of storyline this book should hit the  spot.<br />KISS OF THE BEAST is a major fantasy and I recommend it but only  for other weirdos like myself *g*.nd loving,  sweet, sensitive, not to mention beautiful, faithful, and best of all he  shed tears!

From the moment Alena  lands on Cadvallan Island she realizes there is more going on there than  she was led to believe. She also finds herself unwillingly  &quot;bonded&quot; to a clumsy baby dragon she names Paddy whom follows her  everywhere.<br /> Since Galen's self-imposed exile he has refused to use his  &quot;evil&quot; magical powers, fearing they will consume him. He is  content living his life feeding and caring for the sickly dragons. Galen's  life changes dramatically when Alena crashes through the magical barriers  and enters Cadvallan Island and does everything within her power to  convince him to help her.<br /> This book has a great heroine who does the  seducing and a sweet, tortured hero who I really loved. The clash of the  hero &amp; heroine's opposite personalities (she's a warrior, he's a  pacifist) adds a ton of heat to the story. Paddy, the dragon, is a scene  stealer and made me smile whenever he appeared. He kind of reminded of my  lovable, eager to please but very clumsy puppy (the author says Paddy is  based on her son's English Cocker Spaniel). I only wish he had more scenes!	2000-04-29

Word has it that they've predicted the war and are the  only ones who may be able to avert it. Lancer's job is to prove the  Pythias' powers are a reality and convince the planet to join the United  Planets Republic before their powers fall into the wrong hands.<br /> Thena  is planet Delphi's Golden Pythia. She is the most important oracle on the  planet because of her outstanding accuracy rating. Unlike other Pythias  Thena remembers her prophecies and fears succumbing to madness like her  mother before her. When Lancer shows up on her planet and talks about mind  doctors called psychiatrists she sees a possible cure for her problems and  intends to go to earth. Only her father, ignorant to her fears of insanity,  refuses to let her go.<br /> Both Thena and Lancer have reasons for keeping  their agendas to themselves. Thena hasn't shared the fact that she  remembers her prophecies with anyone including her own Father. Lancer goes  to the planet on the pretense of making a film about the Pythias. He  doesn't state his real intentions for fear the Delphians will accuse him of  using them.<br /> Nevan is the irritant in their budding relationship. He's  Thena's observer who is supposed to accurately write down her prophesies.  Whenever they get close Nevan gets between them. When they discover he is  lying and attempting to destroy her status as Golden Pythia for his own  selfish motives a distraught Thena runs off to Earth with Lancer to quickly  find a cure and save both her mom, herself and her reputation.<br /> A lack  of communication and their secret agendas continually come between them,  along with a series of outside events that cause them both angst and pain.  Both are good people with their hearts in the right place but their  different worlds divide them. Both characters must realize what is most  important to them before they can find true happiness.<br /><br />GOLDEN  PROPHECIES is an action packed read where the adventure sometimes outweighs  the romance. A little more time exploring the feelings of the hero and  heroine as they dealt with each new adversity would've made the characters  come truly alive for this reader.<br /> This fantasy romance fan found the  prophecy sessions quite fascinating and delighted in reading about a  simpler world filled with magic rather than technological gadgets.

The planet is rather backwoods in her eyes and she  feels the only way they can survive is to join forces with the Republic of  Planets and accept technology and all of the wonders it'll bring. During  her meeting with Delphi's ruling council her biggest and loudest resister  to her ideas is Councilman Eron. He's impossibly pigheaded, stubborn and  outspoken.<br /> Juelle is a psychiatrist. Several Pythias fear they may  succumb to madness and she is the only qualified person to heal them.  Because of Eron's strong objections and refusal to listen to her proposal  the Council orders him to travel with her as she heads out to heal an  ailing Pythia in his home town.<br /> At first she is pleased with this  arrangement thinking she will be able to change his mind in the two hours  it will take to make the trip. But she underestimates his stubbornness and  soon finds out they will be making the trip by horseback, of all the  archaic things, and that it will take them two weeks because Mr. Pigheaded  refuses to set foot in her aircraft!<br /> As they travel they get to know  each other and find it hard to resist their mutual attraction, only they  must because they are also traveling with Eron's cousin Hermes and a very  sensitive moncat (creatures who bond with Pythias). During their travels  they are accosted by the evil Nevan who was banished from Delphi for  betraying a Pythia. He has concocted a plan to gain leadership of the  planet and he needs Juelle in order to complete his treachery. Will Eron go  against everything he believes in and use technology in order to save the  woman who has come to mean so much to him?<br /> QUICKSILVER lives up to its  name. The pages turned so quick that before I realized it I had swallowed  up 150 pages without a bathroom break or anything to eat!

Neither have laid eyes on the other before but are both  willing to go along with the prearranged marriage. Meg accepts this as her  fate (although she is by no means a wimp!) &amp; Dominic wants to claim the  castle &amp; lands that come along with Meg and begin working on making  himself some heirs. Only problem is that Meg happens to be one of the  cursed Glendruid (white) witches that for centuries have been unable to  conceive male offspring because of a witche's past mistake and the missing  Glendruid Wolf. It has been rumored that all Glendruid women are unable to  fall in love with a man and vice versa because their powers of perception  make them cold and impossible to love. This isn't the only obstacle the  couple must face in order to find happiness....<br /> Meg is a charming  heroine with a touching love for her people &amp; land who will sacrifice  everything to save the people who mean so much to her. She's truly an  admirable character. Dominic is a wonderful scarred hero who wants nothing  more than to settle down and end all of the fighting and bloodshed.<br />  Overall this was a very sensuous and tender love story with a wonderful  ending.

Never having murdered someone, Richard is having a  hard time of it. He's replaced the bloodstained couch and painted the wall  but he still can't forget that awful night.<br /> Overwhelmed with guilt, he  attends the funeral of the small time crook and is spotted by the dead  man's dangerous ex-con father. Dear old Dad is none too happy with his  son's murderer and while he's not dumb enough to come right out and say it  he alludes to what a shame it would be if something were to happen to  Dane's four-year-old son. An eye for an eye and all that.<br /> This is only  the beginning of Dane's weird introduction into a world chock full of  bizarre goings-on. Dane's quiet little life will never be the same as he  comes face to face with the darkest side of human nature.<br /> Although COLD  IN JULY is by no means a light book - it's dark and as suspenseful as a  books gets - the best thing about it is it's well drawn, flawed characters  and the wickedly funny dialogue. I would excerpt some of my favorite lines  but going back through the book I realize they're all pretty nasty.  Lansdale's humor probably isn't for everyone but those who like humorous,  earthy dialogue will be in for a good howl.	2000-04-28

It's an imaginative story of love,  betrayal and forgiveness, filled with intriguing characters you won't soon  forget. The dialogue is sparse and the tale is short but there is an  abundant amount of character growth and plenty of plot points to ponder.  There's also enough magic and surprises to keep those pages turning. I  never knew quite where the story was going to lead.

It starts out with an obscure prologue that had me shaking my head but that was only the beginning.  Once the story got into gear it became incoherent  and nearly impossible to stick with.  Character motivation isn't explained  and as a result most of the characters come across as little more than  cardboard cutouts.  Secondary characters pop out of nowhere with little or  no introduction and only serve to muddy up the plot further than disappear  never to be heard from again.  And, because there are so many constant  interuptions,  the love story suffers greatly and is forgotten for chapters  on end  The couple have almost no time to get to know each other before  they are declaring their undying love to one another.  Sorry, I just didn't  buy it.<br /> And totally unromantic sentences like this one did not help to  endear the hero to me at all:  &quot;His tender feelings didn't scatter, as  he remembered her fingernails scoring his back, and the most marvelous  words a man in rut can hear - Don't stop.&quot;<br /> A man in rut?

There is a meddlesome ghost pushing the couple together, of  course, but mainly the story is about the heroine trying to fit in with her  fellow townspeople who treat her unfairly.  Both the hero and the heroine  are decent people, honestly portrayed, who are easy to like.  I was very  satisfied when they eventually opened up to each other and put an end to  their repetitive cycle of non-communication.  Pick up this one if you're in  the mood for a slower paced, character driven novel.	2000-04-28

She must &quot;recharge&quot; by mating with a powerful lover.  How's that for a hook?  Frustratingly, though,  that promising idea wasn't enough to make  this book anything more than average.  I soon lost all interest in the  story because of the irritatingly flawless (and often too stupid to live)  heroine and all of the other cardboard-like characters that filled the  book.  If I had to sum up this story in one word it would be  &quot;emotionless&quot;.  I felt no connection to the characters.  Despite  a few charming moments the story was bogged down with a weak conflict that  was not consistently developed.  I don't recommend this one unless you  _really_ have a thing for witches and relationships based solely on lust.	2000-04-27

On the one year anniversary of the plane crash that killed his beloved wife and daughters he visits their cemetery and spots a woman taking pictures of their grave marker. He approaches her and sets off a series of events that make him  question if the death of his family and 300 others was the intentional work  of officials attempting to cover up something that could possibly change  mankind for all time. As he digs for the truth he witnesses and discovers  strange, terrifying, incomprehensible events, and finds evidence that is  impossible for him to ignore. He finds a purpose for living once he  realizes he may be the only person left alive to expose the truth.<br /> Dean  Koontz usually writes so much more than an eerie, suspense filled  page-turner and SOLE SURVIVOR is no exception. He creates characters who  are human, people you care about and anguish with, everyday people stuck in  extraordinary situations. He's outdone himself with the character of Joe.  Poor, tortured Joe. His grief is expressed so vividly I felt his sorrow and  my heart broke about a million times as he's reminded of his wife and girls  in nearly every thing he does.<br /><br />Any book that can keep me on edge like  this one did and make me care so much about a character gets my  recommendation. There were a few parts that dragged a little bit but  overall it was an interesting, emotional and nail-biting read.<br /> Koontz  writes an thrilling story and he continually surprises me but it's his  talent for characterization that keeps him on the top of my favorite author  list.	2000-04-27

It's pure fun	Within the pages of this book you'll find not one but three terrific love stories all bound together with a skillful paranormal thread.  Normally I feel short-changed when a book concentrates on more than one couple but that wasn't the case this time around.  Because each love story is so  entwined with the plot and all of the characters continue to interact with  each other once the focus shifts from their romance I never felt that  cheated.<br /> All three heroes are a bit on the &quot;arrogant alpha&quot;  side but meet up with heroines who are more than their match.  You'll find  lots of humor and passion but no weak kneed, simpering heroines here.  I  highly recommend this one to paranormal romance lovers who are looking for  a fast paced romance.  It worked on all levels for me, the picky paranormal  reader.	2000-04-27

His life would be perfect if only his Mother would stop making him feel guilty for forgetting his Vietnamese roots.<br /><br />When Tommy  returns home one night, after a particularly bad nagging phone call from  Mom, he finds an innocent rag doll lying on his doorstep and brings it in  for a closer inspection. This is when things start getting really weird. In  no time at all Tommy, an eccentric woman who saves his butt, and her  chocolate lab whose favorite toy is a farting hot-dog, are running for  their lives from the devil's spawn. They have until dawn to outrun the  demon.<br /><br />I really have to read the unabridged version of this book. I  hate knowing I missed even one hilarious word. Unlike Koontz's most recent  releases that were sometimes painfully dark, twisted and so intense I  couldn't read them alone TICK TOCK is a more of a screwball comedy that  reminded me of some of my favorite campy B horror flicks. I had visions of  PUPPETMASTER &amp; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD while reading and was reminded  of my favorite kind of B movie demon: The beast that wouldn't die. This is  not a criticism! There is nothing like a good campy B horror movie!<br />  Koontz creates the most likable off the wall characters: the guilt ridden  down to earth Tommy Phan (I don't know anyone who hasn't experienced the  &quot;guilt&quot; phone call), Deliverance Payne who continually surprised  me with her strangeness, Scootie the face licker, and Tommy's Mom who has  some of the most hilarious lines in the book. Which brings me to the  dialogue - some of the funniest I've ever read. Too often humor can seem  forced or stilted but never in this book. The characters were so kooky the  wild dialogue flowed naturally. Some of my favorite scenes weren't the  suspenseful chases or the gore filled shoot-outs but the bantering and  bickering between the characters. TICK TOCK has a little bit of several of  my favorite genres: horror, comedy, suspense, and a good old fashioned  romance.<br /> I found there were a few unexplained plot points in the  abridged version I read and I'm hoping they will be cleared up when I read  the full version or maybe I'll just hope for a sequel.bickering between the characters.

When he returns she is shocked and upset. She's made a new life for herself and  does not want him back. But the man who returns to her is a changed one,  he's kinder, he's honorable, he acts like he genuinely cares for her, and  he awakens feelings in her she never had for her husband. He's now a man  she could easily fall in love with. But is he an imposter and is everything  they're building based on a lie?<br /> I thought this was a very romantic and  sensual story. It had a strong, lovable hero and a heroine who was easy to  empathize with but in all honesty some of her actions/reactions mystified  me. She was a smart, self-sufficient person but she let her nasty Uncle and  his abhorrant wife treat her like dirt without a word of complaint. She was  also a bit of a tease throughout most of the book. Her &quot;kiss me&quot;,  &quot;touch me&quot; then &quot;no, wait I've changed my mind stop  NOW&quot; made sense the first few times considering her past sexual  experiences but quickly got on my nerves when it was continually repeated.  She really tortured this poor guy ;)<br /> Even though I saw Sommersby I  found this spin on the plot just as interesting and liked it even better  because it ended happily. I cared about the characters, felt them fall in  love and was only a little annoyed towards the end when their actions  didn't ring true to their feelings. All in all this was a very well  developed and a touching romance. I really enjoyed it.	2000-04-27

Her books are meaty and always contain complicated characters who really draw you in.  Touch of the Wolf, the beginning of her new historical werewolf trilogy, is no exception.  For me, the love and laughter lover, this book weighed in a  little too heavily on the angst side but still comes recommended to those  of you who prefer a dark, brooding and outwardly cold hero (until the  heroine breaks down his barriers).  It's rich with description and is a  book that you can easily lose yourself in.  I'm anxiously awaiting the next  one.	2000-04-27

She's decided she likes her solitary life of running free with her horses and doesn't need to be married to be happy. That is until she meets Hadrian, Duke of  Clayborough at a masquerade party she is forced to attend due to pride when  the invitation is spat at her from the snotty Lady Stacy. I really liked  Nicole's personality, she doesn't let anyone walk all over her and stands  up for herself. Once she realizes that Hadrian is betrothed and only wants  her for one thing she lets him know exactly how she feels by trying to give  him a well deserved whack with a riding crop, no whining and no tears just  pure unrestrained anger. I loved it.<br /> Hadrian, on the other hand, took  some getting used to. He's one of those guys that thinks it's his right to  screw around on his fiancee as long as he does it with married woman and  doesn't get attached. Once he discovers Nicole is unmarried he breaks it  off immediately and also breaks her heart in the process. I was really  ticked at him, but rake that he may be, he was betrothed to Elizabeth since  she was two and although he genuinely cares for her he feels no great love  towards her and thinks of her more as a sister. Even though Nicole gets  under his skin the way no other woman has his strong sense of duty will not  let him break it off with Elizabeth.<br /> The couple have many obstacles to  overcome, Elizabeth being only the first one. They experience a very bumpy  road when all could've been cleared up with a little communication but  because both of these characters have such stubborn personalities and loads  of pride they both suffer. This book also turned out to have a very  engrossing secondary story about Hadrian's mother.<br /><br />I really enjoyed  this one, it brought tears to my eyes. I loved Nicole's spirit and her  temper had me laughing out loud. And underneath all of Hadrian's  stubbornness he turned out to be a real sweetheart.l of Hadrian's  stubbornness he turned out to be a real sweetheart.	2000-04-27

I *love* shared world collections but usually find myself annoyed at having wasted my precious reading time wading through at least one clunker in the bunch.  So, I approached this collection with a little hesitation, sure I'd find myself skimming at least one of the stories.  I'm thrilled to  report that all four stories were skillfully told and enjoyable and no  skimming was necessary.  My favorite was Barbara Samuel's THE LOVE TALKER  which featured a cursed male faery saved from his torment by the love of a  mortal woman.  Sigh, this story was so romantic that it was worth the cost  of the entire book.  My least favorite was probably Jo Beverly's tale THE  LORD OF ELPHINDALE only because the hero acted like an all-around jerk to  the heroine (who was supposed to be his childhood best-friend) for far too  long.  This is a story that could've benefited from 100 or so more pages to  flesh out his actions and make the romance more believable.  Still, this  was a fitting addition to the collection and is nowhere near what I'd  consider a &quot;clunker&quot;.  If you enjoy romance and hold a soft-spot  in your heart for faeries this is a not-to-be-missed book.	2000-04-27

Claire is what they call a &quot;keeper&quot;,  a person with supernatural powers who keeps order in the universe and the  evilness of hell under wraps. Her latest assignment has her ticked off.  She's been summoned to a bed &amp; breakfast where hell resides in the  basement and she fears she may be stuck there for the rest of her life. She  spends the book attempting to figure out how to complete her assignment  while fighting off the advances of the sexy ghost, fighting off her lusty  thoughts of the younger handyman, arguing with her know it all cat (who  talks!) and dealing with the strange assortment of guests who visit the  B&amp;B.<br /> This book was pure fun, had lots of sensual tension, some  great one-liners (many made by Hell - who argues with itself), and all of  the characters were likable. Despite the setting there was nothing gory  about it. If you like fantasy comedies or are looking for a change of pace  give this one a try. I hope Huff turns this universe into a series because  I'd really like to see these people again.	2000-04-26

She's one of the few authors that I run out to the bookstore and buy brand new, usually the day of their release, because I know they aren't sticking around on the shelves for long  after being put there. Her first two novels, KNIGHT OF A TRILLION STARS and  HIGH ENERGY, are two of my most beloved reads of all time. They're filled  with funny characters, sexier than sin heroes, laugh out loud situations  and originality. REJAR was also a good read for me but I thought the sexy  cat-man deserved a better heroine, one with a little more bite but I still  recommend it because the hero was amazing enough to carry the book. Because  her other books were so magical for me I think I went into TONIGHT OR NEVER  with too high expectations and ended up being a little let down.<br />  Tonight Or Never started out promising and had my eyes glued to the pages.  I loved the introduction of the hero, John, it was just so apropos  considering he was nicknamed the &quot;Lord of Sex&quot;, and the heroine,  Chloe, was much, much better than Lilac (in REJAR). She was likable, she  had spunk and she wasn't afraid to go after what she wanted. She definitely  wasn't a bore or a whimp. I wasn't sure if I could imagine a rake like  John, who slept with any female that crossed his path, settling down with  one woman. But I have to hand it to Dara Joy, midway through the story I  really bought it.<br /><br />So why wasn't this another keeper? Well, I just  didn't find it all that funny, definitely not as funny as her previous  work. Some of the situations were cute but nothing made me laugh. And I  found the subplot featuring the search for the Black Rose a little on the  boring side. Then there were the sex scenes. Much to my delight there were  a lot of 'em but to my dismay they weren't the kind that draw me into the  scene and make me feel a part of them. I guess I kept waiting for the  &quot;Lord of Sex&quot; to do something truly extraordinary but this is  probably more the publisher than the author's fault. And one last niggle, I  wish John's true sensitive nature had been revealed in little bits and  pieces throughout the novel, rather than in one short paragraph towards the  very end (that one short paragraph made my eyes fill with tears but it was  too darn short!) I would've liked to have been witness to more of his  past.<br /><br />If I hadn't read Dara Joy's previous works and loved them so  much I feel I may have enjoyed this one much more than I did and have been  less picky. Still, if you like light-hearted romps and ultra-sexy heroes  (with sensitive hearts) you'll want to give this one a try.this is  probably more the publisher than the author's fault.

It was refreshing to read about a heroine who  had no care for looks and although she was physically perfect she didn't  feel it was an important part of who she was.

He never stays in one place long enough to form any kind  of emotional attachment and has broken many a heart along the way. His life  is about to change when he answers an add for free room and board in  exchange for a little work at the Throckmorton apple orchard. How hard can  picking apples be after all?<br /> The last thing Mariah Throckmorton wants  is change in her life, especially in the form of a big, shiftless male. She  is living in a self imposed exile while hiding from a scandalous past and a  tragedy she has never allowed herself to recover from. She does her  darndest to get this lazy critter off of her farm, which tends to make him  all the more determined to hang around and take whatever new torture  disguised as work she dishes out. She intrigues him as no other woman has  and her obliviousness to his charms makes her all the more alluring.<br />  The author writes with such emotional intensity I found myself either  smiling or crying on nearly every page. She skillfully blends raucous wit  with tender and heartbreakingly painful moments of emotion making IYB a  powerful, not soon to be forgotten read. You won't find any fancy locales  or wacky adventures in this book. What you will find is an honest down to  earth book about two lonely people overcoming their fear of emotional  intimacy and learning about the healing powers of love.

It's about learning to see past the surface and finding the true beauty within a person and getting past  assumptions and misconceptions and learning to love. The hero is disabled  (and that's all I'm going to give away!) and, after being rejected by the  people who meant the most to him, has spent the majority of his adult life  avoiding people. The heroine is a super-model, who has millions but is  unhappy with her life and finds herself envious of those who've found love  because she's been unable to. People just don't care to dig deep enough to  see the beauty inside of her. Whaaaa, you say, right? How can I sympathize  with a rich super-model? Well, I didn't think I could - until I read the  book. She's not a self-centered snot and is a surprisingly sympathetic and  likable character with a few insecurities of her own. Her dogged attraction  to the reluctant hero and her determination to break down his barriers come  across realistically and touched me deeply. The hero is one of the most  unforgettable I've ever read about in a romance. He's beautiful and wounded  - both inside and out - and oh-so-deserving of love. This is a  compassionate love story even my shoddy memory won't soon forget. Read it!	2000-04-25

I have never read a romance so devoid of romance in the nine years that I've been reading the genre.<br /> The story starts out when Diandra Reynell and her younger sister Selena leave India shortly after  Diandra's husband mysteriously dies. Selena loathes India and wants to  spend a season in London where she hopes to snag a husband. Although  Diandra fears her step-son, Justin, the Earl of Skene, will be less than  thrilled with their sudden appearance she holds out hope he will do his  duty by sponsoring Selena and putting them up for six months.<br /> What  Diandra fails to anticipate is the level of hatred Justin feels towards  her. He seems to think she has murdered not only his Father (for his money)  but also his Mother years earlier (so he would be free to marry her).  Having had enough of Justin's insinuations and insults she tells him she  will get lodging elsewhere. He decides to do the noble thing and puts them  up but only so he can keep a close eye on her and hopefully find some sort  of evidence to prove that she is a murderess.<br /> When tables begin  levitating and ghostly apparitions begin to appear Justin assumes it is all  Diandra's trickery while she thinks it is his way of scaring her into  leaving. This is only one of many obstacles that face them. There are  murders, and dark secrets, jealous relatives, not to mention their own  prickly personalities. Although they bicker by day they can't deny their  physical attraction to each other in the dark of night where anything is  possible and secrets are kept. They indulge in all kinds of carnal sex but  once their needs are satiated they dislike and suspect each other all over  again. The story takes a bit of a turn when women begin showing up dead and  Diandra is almost the next victim and Justin is forced to reevaluate his  misconceptions about her.<br /> This is an uncommonly harsh review for me and  I hesitated writing it. Why? Because I realize this is just my opinion and  that authors have feelings too. But when I spend $4.99 of my hard earned  money on a book marked historical romance and I don't find even a glimmer  of romance within its 352 pages I get very perturbed. I realize this is  probably not the author's fault but the spine on this book should read  &quot;Historical Erotica&quot; because this book is not a romance, IMO.<br />  So what did I have a problem with? Well, first off I like snappy, witty or  even sentimental dialogue. You know, the kind of dialogue that makes you  like the characters? DMO was filled with bitter, argumentative dialogue.  Not only were the hero and heroine snapping at each other but so were most  of the secondary characters! There wasn't a charming one in the bunch  (well, maybe that poor sucker George but he was a very bit player). It got  depressing and repetitive after page 100 and it never brightened up.<br /> I  have to give the author credit for pushing the envelope in the sex  department but as much as I enjoy explicit sex I fear the characterization  suffered in this book in order to include more sex scenes. I never got the  impression that these two got to know each other or even truly liked each  other. After the first sex act the many that followed bored me because I  didn't care about these people. There was nothing sexy about their trysts  because I knew they couldn't stand each other. I just can't fathom how  anyone can be attracted to someone that makes them want to smash their face  in with every obnoxious word they utter. Maybe my view of romance is skewed  but romance, at least in my eyes, is about more than just lusting over  someone's bod. This book was missing some important ingredients like  caring, tenderness, and love. When I finished the last page I pictured  these two killing each other in about a month.<br /> Not only did the  characters bother me but the writing did as well. The author has a habit of  repeating herself, repeating herself, repeating herself. For example the  hero is observing the heroine and the author writes, &quot;He watched her,  watched her, watched her&quot;. This strange sort of repeating thing is  done many times over the course of the book - by both characters! I assume  it's a quirk of the author or maybe she was striving for a stream of  consciousness style of writing but it became annoying and distracting.<br />  Well, if anything, I've learned that I like the idea of graphic sex but it  has to be between two characters who like each other and I need a little  dose of romance to go along with it or it just doesn't work for me. A  little tenderness, a smile, a gentle caress, and a kind word would've made  the descriptions of what one does with a man's cream all the more effective  in my opinion . .ating herself, repeating herself, repeating herself.

It's that soft side that eventually breaks down Mary's  barriers and allows her to heal and open her eyes to true love<br /> I must  admit that I'm the type of reader who prefers a kinder, gentler hero but  much to my surprise I found myself enjoying the alpha Stephen's displays of  manliness. Oh, he's definitely bossy and gruff, and, yes, sometimes he's  even a little rougher than necessary, but he (thankfully!) doesn't cross  the line into nasty or abusive. He's a decent man who feels regret and he  knows how to apologize. As a result, he was darn near impossible to  dislike. If you enjoy a take charge hero with a heart of gold you really  can't go wrong with this guy. The way he unwillingly kowtows to Mary and  then wants to kick himself made me laugh out loud at times. He's precious<br /> Mary is a *young* heroine in emotional turmoil, one whose youth and  backbone tend to get her into trouble. She's suffered tragedy upon tragedy  and, finally, when she's gotten her future somewhat settled in walks  Stephen who turns her life upside down. She's upset with this impossible  situation and reacts with emotion, often not thinking through the  consequences of her impetuous actions. Stephen's strong personality does  not initially bring out the best in her. Eventually, with experience and a  lot of love and patience, she learns to trust Stephen and discovers who her  real enemies are.<br /> CONQUEST OF THE HEART, currently available only as an  e(lectronic)-book, is a fast paced, ultra-sexy romp that is probably not  for the faint-hearted. The bloody, and treacherous darkness of the medieval  period is brought to life in vivid detail and the villains are horrible  creatures who do and think unsavory things that the reader witnesses.  However, if you like your romances filled with explosive sensuality and  have a fondness for strong *and* kind-hearted heroes you should most  definitely download this love story.

As his luck would have it one of his most dangerous inmates, Agnes Hatcher AKA the surgeon because of her propensity  to skillfully remove body parts, escapes. She believes she shares past  lives with Trey and sets out to fulfill their destiny and will destroy  anyone who gets in her way. This is a chilling, taut, fast-paced story that  was impossible for me to put down because the author creates such a  fascinating villain: a pretty, petite girl turned into a savage monster. I  was repulsed and riveted and enjoyed it completely.	2000-04-25
US	52186522	R7FPUJFXAO8XC	0553576267	570329646	The Vow	Books	3	7	10	N	N	Very putdownable	I just finished Juliana Garnett's THE VOW (a medieval) and was mightily disappointed. I'd heard nothing but raves about this author and this book but I found it very easy to put down and thought it got bogged down with  too much war strategy and politics and the heroine and hero had a  hate/desire relationship throughout a big portion of the book (he takes  over her castle and becomes his property, she's not a doormat and fights  back, etc). The author also did something awful to the heroine's pet wolf  that just about made me toss the book away unfinished and made me break my  vow of never reading the end of the book before I was done. This wasn't a  bad book, I've surely read worse, but all of the political intrigue just  wasn't for me. I did like the hero (although he was alpha in the extreme)  and the heroine was likable, she fought back, and had a razor sharp tongue.  She was most definitely this hero's match. And the book was very sensual  but most of it was *need* rather than love. I'd give this one a 3 out of 5  because I did a lot of skimming but I did like the characters and the  heroine's pet.	2000-04-25

A huge portion of the book follows Anita Blake as she's working and this time she's called in on a case that is particularly gruesome.  Three teen boys are brutally slain, a young teen girl is left for dead and a young boy has been kidnapped, possibly by a deviant sexual predator of a vampire who enjoys toying with children.  It's dark and painful to read the grief instilled within some of these pages.<br /><br />Anita must also raise an entire graveyard of the dead for a client with only Larry the apprentice as backup.  Even she realizes this may too much to handle and is struggling with how she's going to do it without a human sacrifice.  As if all of this weren't enough to handle, she has to deal with a fey being that may or may not be a bad guy.  The only thing she knows for sure is that he's screwing up her latest assignment and is using magic when he shouldn't be.<br /><br />I really loved this format for these earlier books.  I'm so disappointed that it has been screwed with so much in later books.  Anyway, as we all know Anita is still dating Richard and Jean Claude.  And, surprise, surprise she has to call in Jean Claude for assistance on her vampire case.  Once he arrives in his triple poofy armed shirt and spiffy cravat the story takes a little detour from hard boiled vampire executioner and zombie raising mayhem to Anita fending off sexy Jean Claude's flirtations and dealing with vampire politics and protocol and a new master who uses Anita's past to heart-breaking effect.<br /><br />This book here is Jean Claude's book, all you Richard and Edward fans have been warned.  It's pretty easy to see which guy Anita is really digging here.  The \\"monster\\" line begins to get real fuzzy for Anita and the sexuality is ramped up a notch but I'm still okay with that because there is a plot to this book and it moves.  I was always entertained and never bored, irritated or lost.  Hamilton excels at keeping all of these plot threads going without confusing her reader all the while giving us tantalizing new tidbits about her main characters.  The only thing missing is the darker edged humor that I enjoyed in the first few books.  Bloody Bones was so intense it really would have benefited from some well placed sarcasm and dark humor.g all of these plot threads going without confusing her reader all the while giving us tantalizing new tidbits about her main characters.

This is the 3rd book in Stella's &quot;Rossmara&quot; series and easily stands alone (I haven't yet read Charmed &amp; Fascination but am going searching for them today!). Justine decides it is her duty to enlighted woman on what they can expect from men,  during courtship all the way to the marriage bed. Being a spinster she  needs to do some research before she can begin her book. She travels to  Scotland with the intention of taking care of Struan's two motherless  children in exchange for his help with her book. They both end up with more  than they bargained for. Justine's passages into her book had me laughing  out loud, I could *see* Struan cringing as she wrote them!<br /> What I love  most about Stella's writing is her characterization, these people really  come alive whether I love them or hate them (and I absolutely despised  Grandmama, what a selfish woman!).<br /> This is a fantastic read. Funny,  tender, suspenseful and very sexy. The identity of the nutcase who was  making Struan's life miserable was also a major shocker! I can't wait to  dig into Arran &amp; Calum's stories!	2000-04-24

I've come to the realization that Jayne Castle/Krentz/Quick's voice/style just doesn't work for me because this is the 6th book of hers that I've read that I found very dull. I should note  that I do not like mysteries as a rule so maybe that's my problem because  that's what the bulk of this book was.<br /> Set on another planet, 200 years  in the future, Amaryllis Lark is what they call a professional  &quot;prism.&quot; Her world is filled with people born with differing  psychic abilities who are unable to use them without the help of a prism  who helps them focus their talents. Lucas needs a high talent prism to help  him find a leak in his company. This leads to much adventure and when they  &quot;link&quot; it leads to true love.<br /> I found my mind wandering a lot  while reading this one. I was so looking forward to a good futuristic  romance but was disappointed because this one read so much like a  contemporary/mystery. Castle's world of psychics and prisms was filled with  so much promise that was never fulfilled in my eyes. It disappointingly  mirrored current day earth with the exception of the psychic talents and  the unimaginatively and laughably named items like jelly-ice, snake-bat,  coff-tea, etc. and so on. She had explanations for the non-advances in  technology and the silly sounding named items (nostalgia! ) but still it  really bugged me. IMO, this book might as well have been set in current day  Seattle rather than &quot;New Seattle&quot;. I also thought the mystery  portion of the book far overwhelmed the love story.<br /> There were moments  of wit that made me smile but that didn't cut it for me. In the end I  didn't feel anything for Amaryllis or Lucas - they just didn't move me and  that's the most disappointing thing of all.	2000-04-24

The plot  features a likable heroine, a magical cat and one genuine laugh out loud  moment but even that wasn't enough to save this far too average (and often  annoying) story.	2000-04-24

The story begins when werewolves invade the young heroine's life and she learns that she has a &quot;gift&quot; for dealing with these beings.  She begins  a quest to learn all that she can to save those she loves from the  creatures of the night.<br /> Written in a low key style with muted  violence Night Calls is a good choice for younger readers and for those who  don't enjoy in-your-face violence.  The pace was a bit too slow for my  tastes, and all too often I found my eyes glazing over when the minuet  details of the heroine's life got out of control.  Still,  it was a  sufficiently eerie story written with emotion and I immediately liked the  spunky and outspoken heroine.	2000-04-24

Imagine all of the amusing scenarios possible when a handyman (architect actually) poses as a crackpot psychologist to a woman in desperate need of one.  Sadly, what followed was hardly laugh out loud funny for this reader though.<br /> The  heroine Maggie Ivey is a total wimp (and, of course, is a paragon of all  that is loving and good) whose life is in shambles.  With a young ill son  and no health insurance she should elicit reader sympathy.  Unfortunately,  her total dependence on the hero (who she naively believes is &quot;her  doctor&quot;) to fix everything bad in her life quickly strained my  patience. After one speech the fine, strong hero scares off her lecherous  boss who immediately gives her a huge raise, benefits etc. and so on.  We  should all be so lucky  . . .<br /> Besides a lame heroine, the plot hinges  on a huge and totally unbelievable big misunderstanding that could've been  cleared up ten minutes into the book.  The hero is a great guy, don't get  me wrong (he's the only good thing about the book) but his silly excuses to  withhold the truth of his identity from Maggie were an obvious and annoying  plot tactic created by the author to drag out her story.  And, boy, did it  drag.  I won't even get started on the stereotypical female secondary  characters who were all self centered, workaholic, super ( ) taken  straight from the archives of a bad Melrose Place episode.<br /> Another  thing that really bugged me throughout the reading of this novel was the  fact that the heroine was called &quot;Maggie Ivey&quot; whenever the hero  thought of her - even after they got close.  Here's an example of the hero  thinking about Maggie:  &quot;oh, if only I could tell Maggie Ivey the  truth&quot; -- &quot;if only Maggie Ivey didn't think I was her  psychologist&quot; -- &quot;If only Maggie Ivey weren't such a dunce&quot;  - whoops that last one was mine.  This may sound like a minor nit-pick but  it quickly becomes major when one is listening to it on an audiobook.  Finally, the reading of this audiobook nearly put me into a coma because  the actress exhibited zero emotion and all of her characters sounded eerily  similar.<br /> This great hero was worthy of a much better heroine.  For  his sake and sanity, I only hope that Maggie perishes (probably while  helping a kitten cross the street) so that he can find one.

It is not the type of book I, the love and laughter type,normally choose to read.  Written in first person it is the story of Lora, a young woman whose dreams have been shattered by tragedy.  It is the story of her coming to terms with her grief, facing it, and reestablishing a relationship with her husband Eli who loves her more than his own life.  Although not a typical love story, this book left an emotional impact on me like very few do and I ended up finishing it in one tear blurred sitting.

The beginning and the end of the book are its best sections because the characters are fun, charming and heartwarming.  But, sadly, the book wasted far too much of  it's middle with the characters caught in a seemingly endless cycle of  annoying &quot;I hate you but, darn it,  my traitorous body still wants you  oh-so-bad&quot; behavior.  As a result, what could have been an  exceptional read turned out to be yet another average one.

She's an independent woman who can't cook, he's a beat 'em over  the head and drag 'em by the hair kinda guy that thinks woman are good for  only one thing, until he gets stranded on a desert island with Smitty and  three small orphans. There's also a delightful Genie with three wishes who  needs to find a true believer to fulfill his destiny.<br /> The verbal  sparring between this odd couple is hilarious, Muddy, the Genie, adds a  touch of magic and humor to the story &amp; also makes a convenient baby  sitter :), the kids are darling and the scenes where Hank warms up to them  are really touching. It was so much fun to see Hank's attitude about women  and children change after being stuck with them day in and day out with no  escape. The last few chapters had me teary eyed. I recommend this one for  anyone looking for a feel good romance with a happy ending and lots of  sexual tension! This book is the ultimate fantasy.	2000-04-21

One day as he is quietly studying in the library a seductive woman named Emily picks him up and his life is forever changed. She claims he is a demon, as is she, which is why  she is attracted to him. Her arrival reawakens his suppressed memories and  opens up a dream-like world called Nightland where Anthony is forced to  deal with strange, twisted versions of his past. As his love for Emily  grows in intensity the more he fears he is losing his mind.<br /> Anthony is  a very sympathetic character. He's lives quietly and has survived life on  the streets and has somehow managed to rise above his horrid beginnings and  is attending college. He's a survivor but once he meets Emily the reader  realizes just how close to edge of insanity he really is. His  heart-breaking past was revealed in little bits in pieces with just enough  information to make me want to keep reading. I really felt for Anthony but  had a bit of a problem with Emily who I never really got a handle on, which  may have been the author's intent. While the reader learns everything about  Anthony very little about Emily is revealed and I found her dialogue so  stilted that it continually threw me out of the story. Although most of the  story was compelling and made me keep turning the pages there were too many  times when the book wandered off on odd tangents - these were mostly times  spent with Emily looking for a frog fountain, kung-fu fighting off dirty  old teachers or having pow-wows with her Indian friends. They added a  surreal sense to the book but didn't do much to advance the plot. Or maybe  I just didn't get it. So, although Anthony was an interesting character and  the book had plenty of horrific moments I can't wholeheartedly recommend  this one.	2000-04-20

The majority of the stories here are, unfortunately written with a heavy  handed, unsexy style of clinical sex that is anything but what I'd term  &quot;erotic&quot;.  Juvenile descriptions of faceless body parts entering  other faceless body parts does not equal erotica.  There was little story  and even less characterization here and the &quot;vampire&quot; tales were  mostly rehashes that have been done far better by other authors.  My  recommendation is to skip this one, save yourself a few bucks and if you're  looking few a few chills and thrills pick up a Hot Blood anthology (edited  by Jeff Gelb) instead.	2000-04-20

But as badly as she wants to accept his friendship and  believe he is innocent she can't allow him to get entangled in her  complicated life. But he's a persistent bugger, especially when he realizes  how much she means to him and that she's in trouble, and he won't leave her  knowing she's in danger. But his refusal to leave and his search to find  the root of her fears may put her in even greater danger. He knows he is in  way over his head but his heart won't let him give up until the mystery of  her past is solved.<br /> DREAMS OF YOU is an original story of soul mates  and the possibility of true love overcoming any obstacle.

The book started out funny and the premise was wild but  eventually the story turned dull as more and more time was spent on Jack's  self-centered, annoying friends who were lusting after each others'  wives/boyfriends/etc. etc. I really liked Jack and his moon goddess Lily -  they were the only compassionate characters in the bunch - but his friends  hogged up most of the book	2000-04-20
US	52186522	R8YBTFWJMULDT	0843943785	598687300	Embrace the Night	Books	2	74	83	N	N	A vampire romance sadly lacking any real &quot;bite&quot;	I think I should start off this review by stating that I've read so many vampire novels and vampire romances that I fear I may be jaded. I used to love anything that had to do with vampires but now it takes a lot of originality (or humor and/or gut-wrenching emotion) to &quot;wow&quot; me  and hold my interest and this book, the first of what I believe is a  series, just didn't do it for me.<br /> Gabriel is your standard vampire  hero. He's gorgeous, sensitive and oh-so-lonely. He's loved and lost in the  past and vows to never lose his heart to a mortal again. But all of that  changes when he first sees Sara Jayne, an orphaned child who's life he  saves. He becomes her self-appointed guardian angel and watches over her as  she grows from a sweet child into a beautiful woman. Sara Jayne has  emotional problems and one desolate night decides to take her life. This is  when Gabriel breaks his pledge and shows himself, thus giving her someone  to love and a reason to live.<br /> And then the conflicts begin. Gabriel  loves Sara but she's mortal and he refuses to subject her to his dreary and  cursed existence. Sara loves Gabriel but she's also frightened of him. They  pledge their love to each other but things keep happening to force them  apart: Gabriel pushes her away because he wants her to experience life (he  does this about 3 times), a former lover of Gabriel shows up to make  trouble, and eventually Sara gives up hope of ever having a normal life  with Gabriel and gets engaged to another man (who could blame her after  being rejected so many times?). Inevitably they do find happiness but it's  not an easy road to eternal bliss.<br /> In all honesty I had a hard time  finishing this book because I kept getting the feeling that I had read it  all many times before. And during more than one of the separations I had an  eerie sense that I had already read the exact same scene some 40 pages  earlier. If the characters were more engaging, or the angst-ridden plot  lightened with a bit of humor, I may have enjoyed reading this standard  vampire scenario again but as it was written I just can't recommend it with  any enthusiasm. I never truly cared what happened to either character, I  never felt any spark between the pair and I found the repetitive plot slow  going.ghtened with a bit of humor, I may have enjoyed reading this standard  vampire scenario again but as it was written I just can't recommend it with  any enthusiasm.

US	52186522	RKREJLM334CL0	0553577875	964774746	A Rose in Winter	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Great debut	Young, orphaned, Damon is taken in as a ward by the heroine's father and the two grow up together. They become as close as two souls can be and can't fathom the thought of life without the other. Unfortunately, this is  medieval times and greedy men rule their daughters, so the two are torn  apart and Solange is forced to marry a depraved man or else risk the life  of her dear Damon.<br /><br />After almost a decade of abuse Solange finds the  means to escape the hellish man who's kept her prisoner and is reunited  with Damon. Because they've both been hurt their reconciliation isn't an  easy one and it's a long road before they're able to find bliss because  they've got to confront, admit to, and get past their misconceptions and  heartache.<br /><br />I really liked the way the author avoided creating the  stereotypical wronged and bitter hero. Damon was a dream hero, he was a  lovely blend of contradictions; a powerful warrior and leader but also a  tender healer, he was strong but not too strong and arrogant to admit to  his love for Solange, even after all of the hell he'd been through. He  didn't spend the book denying his feelings and striking out at the heroine.  What a breath of fresh air!  And I empathized with Solange who was  courageous and never let her tortured past overwhelm her. She was abused  and understandably scarred and scared but she didn't use her past as an  excuse to keep Damon at arms length. Her gradual opening up to Damon's  people was real and touching. In a nutshell I liked this book so much  because the characters acted like adults who weren't afraid to admit what  they felt in their hearts. It was refreshing and I definitely recommend  this one, especially if you like strong relationship-based books and  terrific character growth.	2000-04-20

Her characters are nearly always lovable and her stories emotionally satisfying and this one is no exception. It's about satanic cults and, although never gruesomely graphic, certain scenes may bother some readers  (read this one with all the lights on!).<br /><br />The heroine, a famous artist,  decides it's time to go back home and face the demons of her past when she  finds herself struggling with her creativity and having terrible  nightmares. There she meets the hero Cam, former town troublemaker turned  sheriff, who has his own set of problems. Mixed in between the terrific  love story is a gripping tale of a town caught in the midst of a satanic  cult and its effects on the people surrounding the h/h. The ending was a  shocking surprise. This one makes you think twice about how well we ever  really know someone.	2000-04-20

It's now nine years later and Alex has grown into a fearless Knight who is bound by  honor, who is respected for keeping an oath and who refuses to settle down.  It's all of these qualities that prompt his cousin Milo into making an  unsavory offer to Alex.<br /><br />Good old cousin Milo is about to lose his home  because he has failed to impregnate Nicki, whose Uncle placed a clause in  the will that her first son was to inherit the castle and if there was no  child after ten years of marriage the castle would revert to the church.  Milo is a drunken louse who is impotent. So he wants Alex to seduce,  impregnate and then leave Nicolette forevermore so that he can claim the  child as his own and happily drink the rest of his life away. Alex  initially refuses but eventually gives in because he still cares for Nicki  and when Milo tells him he will let another man, a man Alex knows is evil,  drug her and &quot;do the deed&quot; he is left with no other  choice.<br /><br />I honestly wasn't sure how I was going to react to this book  because of the adultery plot. Usually adultery in any way, shape or form  leaves a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and I end up detesting the  couple. It takes a skilled author, one who knows her characters inside and  out - and who has the talent to let her readers see into the souls of those  characters - to make me love, respect and ache for two people caught in  this kind of sticky, seemingly impossible situation. And Patricia Ryan is  just that kind of author.<br /><br />Alex and Nicki aren't vain, selfish people  and they don't want to hurt anyone, they're soul mates who because of a set  of misunderstandings and the inexperience and immaturity of youth were torn  apart. Their rediscovery of love is beautifully portrayed and my eyes went  bleary more than once. And it helped that Milo, pitiful excuse for a human  being that he was, wasn't adverse to the union between Alex and his wife,  especially when he realized he'd gotten in the way of their true love nine  years earlier.<br /><br />If you've read SECRET THUNDER and were dying for  light-hearted, funny and carefree Alex's story you might be a little  surprised to find that he's very serious throughout WW because of the  circumstances he's thrown into the middle of but he's just as sexy.<br />  This book isn't always pleasant but it paints a vivid picture of life in  historical times, smelliness and all, and there is a villain who can only  be described as disgusting! The conflict, although painful and  heart-rending, makes for some super sensual tension and allows the love  story to grow slowly. So if you've decided against reading this book  because of the adultery theme I beg you to reconsider. This one is done  with care and class and isn't filled with silly plot devices thrown in just  to keep the couple apart.nd my eyes went  bleary more than once.

His attorney, Kay Kellogg, is excited by the chance to try such an interesting case and is determined to win but is fighting obstacles every  step of the way. It seems her sexy client is keeping too many secrets -  secrets that may cost her not only the trial but her life!<br /> This was a  very interesting story about multiple personalities. Normally I'm bored by  courtroom dramas, the basis of this story, and I almost put the book aside  when I realized what it was about but the author hooked me with the  multiple personality bit and kept me hooked with the interesting twists and  turns. These same plot twists and the short length of the book left very  little room for romance development or character development though. I  never got into their heads didn't feel them connect or fall in love. The  romance was almost secondary (and unnecessary, IMO) to the plot. There was  little to no humor and the chilling domestic abuse made this a very intense  and dark read. I admit it I'm a sucker and was taken in by the title and  thought this was a beauty and the beast tale. Don't be fooled it isn't or  not in the traditional sense anyway. However, despite my complaints I still  recommend this book because it fascinated me and I couldn't put it down.  Expect an intense plot just but don't count on an intense romance.	2000-04-20

Ardeth Alexander is an average graduate student living an average, structured, somewhat boring life. One morning while exercising she is abducted, blindfolded and finds herself thrown into a cell in a former  sanitarium. As if this isn't enough of a shock she realizes the cell next  to her is also occupied, and the inhabitant isn't human. Ardeth soon  discovers she is there to *feed* the vampire until her usefulness runs out.  Ardeth decides to keep her sanity and believes she can bring the vampire  out of his world of madness (he is also a prisoner &amp; is forced to do  things against his will for some real sickos) by forcing him to speak to  her and when he tries to ignore her she tells him all about herself. This  begins the relationship between Ardeth and Dimitri and if I go on I'll give  too much away.<br /> Pick this one up!  It's one of those books you just  can't put down no matter what is going on around you. It also takes you on  an emotional roller-coaster ride and you won't soon forget the heroine.	2000-04-20

Although not based on a fairy tale, WILD has a beautiful, very romantic, fairy-tale feel to it. The heroine, shunned by the town because they fear she's a witch, lives in a tiny isolated shack  and spends her time caring for wounded beasts. When she stumbles across an  injured man (who turns out to be a knight), she can't help but drag him  back to her home to heal him. Her honesty, gentle ways and lifestyle change  him forever and make him look at life differently. This story has some very  funny moments as these two very different people get to know each other,  but it's also one of the most tender and loving romances I've read in a  while and I thought it was extremely sensual. Their love is apparent in  every word, touch, look and action they share and there are lots of moments  to &quot;sigh&quot; over. An all-around fantastic romance.	1998-12-19

Ahhh, what a satisfying book.  If only everything I read were this good,  well, I'd probably never get anything done!  This is the second book in  Catherine Asaro's Skolian Empire Saga and is also another not-to-be missed  read for hard-core scifi fans and romance readers looking for a  well-written futuristic love story.<br /> Ms. Asaro has created another  extraordinary heroine and hero while maintaining a non-stop action filled  read.  I now know why these books appeal to so many different types of  readers - there's adventure, romance, political intrigue and interesting  future societies and theories that boggle the mind.<br /> The best thing  about this book for me was the characters.  If I can't care about them I  just won't be able to get into a book, no matter how interesting others may  find it.  The author takes as much care developing her characters as she  does her plot which makes this book so special.  Tina may only be seventeen  but she was forced to grow up early and her actions, and responses to the  unbelievable situations she's thrust into are very realistic.  She's  vulnerable and tough, smart and easy to like.  Althor is a perfect match  for her, he's strong, sensitive and moody and with her strong empathic  abilities she's probably the only one who would be able to fully understand  and love him.<br /> My only complaint, and it's a minor one really, that  can probably be attributed to the fact that I don't read much hard scifi,  is that sometimes the book lapsed into long technical explanations that  jogged me out of the story and because I read this book immediately after  finishing PRIMARY INVERSION some of the explanations didn't seem necessary  to me so I skimmed them.  Despite that nit I can't recommend this one  highly enough.  The characterization is flawless - you'll love and route  for these people as they face impossible odds.	1998-10-15

This book is many things and although the love story is very well done, is  extremely sensual and touching, a large part of the book is just Lena's.  And Lena is a wonderfully funny, likable character.  The book is about her  growth as a person as she learns how to slow down and enjoy the simpler  pleasures of life - and learns that she doesn't have to please everyone  (and learns that some people aren't happy no matter how much you do).  The  book goes into vivid detail about her small town and the people she gives  her heart and soul to.  It's heartbreaking, uplifting, erotic and funny  and teaches a lesson a lot of us can really benefit from.  I definitely  enjoyed this story.	1998-10-15

Her wry sense of humor, her leadership  abilities and her emotional strength awed me and despite being full of high  tech hardware she was easy to like and so very human.  Her emotional  battles were as gripping as the ones on the battlefield.  It's that blend  of emotional turmoil, politics, genuine, fully fleshed out characters that  you can care about and the exciting action packed plot that made this such  a gripping read for me.

On the run from a cruel husband she never wanted, Priscilla Stillbottom  ends up in a mining town with little money and no clear plans for the  future.  When the local saloon announces they're looking for a singer she  decides to make her childhood dream of becoming a songstress come true by  applying for the job.<br /> She's about the worst singer saloon owner Payton  has ever heard but because she's so cute and willing to put her heart into  her performance he hires her on a temporary basis.  He cooks up an act  starring her and his gaseous dog and they turn out to be a surprisingly  comical hit with his customers so he decides to keep her around.  It's not  long before they lose their hearts to each other but Priscilla's past  catches up with her and puts their love in jeopardy.<br /> This was a good  read;  sometimes laugh out loud funny, sometimes silly, with the always  poignant love story at the heart of it all.  Payton was a caring, easygoing  hero who never lied and expected the same of everyone else.  Priscilla was  a fun heroine who, in order to make a future for herself, was forced to lie  about her past.  I wasn't thrilled with her dishonesty being the main  conflict between the characters but because they were so likable I still  enjoyed the book better than most.

He's moody, grouchy, bossy and doesn't deal well with people, not surprisingly his community members are scared to death of him.  When his administrative assistant/nanny takes a leave of absence he's at a loss.<br /> When Pippa loses her mother, her job at the Hospital and gets beaten to a pulp by her abusive boyfriend she leaves everything behind and hopes to start over in a small town.  She takes the job at Seth's mansion even though all of her instincts tell her not to. She's had it with dangerous men and resolves to keep her fragile heart closed where Seth is concerned.  He's sexy, he's gorgeous but he's incapable of love or so he thinks until Pippa, with her smiles and irresistible sunny personality, turns his tortured life upside down and teaches him how to laugh . . .<br /> I just loved this book full of wounded souls who eventually find the strength to love and begin to heal.  There wasn't a thing about it to dislike.  The hero and heroine are perfectly matched and watching the way they interacted with each other while trying to avoid love was both funny and touching.  I highly recommend this one for anyone who loves a well developed love story rich in characterization.  END	1998-09-18

They  fall in love despite the fact that the only thing that they have in common  is that neither are the marrying kind.<br />I was a little disappointed with  this one.  First off, where were the dogs?! There was a cat named Angela  but she was pretty much a non-character who only appeared for a scene or  two and didn't do much of anything.  Bummer!  The story was witty and  sometimes really funny but Tess and Nick didn't thrill me.  I thought they  were too extreme. He was too caught up his career and appearances and she  was too do-goody and caught up in the past.  Both learned to compromise a  bit but I left the book feeling that they didn't resolve their major  differences and that they still had a lot of battles to fight out before  they'd live in peace (if ever).  I thought this plot worked more  effectively in Crusie's THE CINDERELLA DEAL.<br />Still STRANGE BEDPERSONS was  a good read and I'd definitely recommend it because Crusie's wicked sense  of humor carried the story for me.	1998-08-23

She heads back home to heal her  wounds and to help out an old friend going through an emotionally trying  time and falls in love with the friend's brother, an old childhood crush,  Josh now a rich playboy and sometimes Attorney.<br />This is the first book by  Nora Roberts that I could easily put down.  Her beautiful knack for  description was there as was her easily readable style but I didn't like  the two lead.  Margo, the gorgeous model heroine, was whiny and spoiled and  used her looks to get whatever she wanted out of life.  She did grow up a  little bit towards the end and realized that the world didn't revolve  around her but I still didn't like her much.  The hero was just plain  spoiled and wasn't present for a huge part of the book so I never grew to  care for him.  I found Daring To Dream to be more effective as a story  about a woman's struggle to rebuild her life after devastation, and her  attempts to reestablish caring and loving relationships with her childhood  friends.<br />Although I didn't click with either main character in this  story, and wasn't excited by the romance, Nora Roberts kept me entertained  with the strong interaction between the friends.  Their love, devotion and  banter came through as very believable and I am looking forward to the two  sequels about Margo's friends' Laura and Kate.

The story starts out when the heroine's boat gets  caught up in a storm and begins to sink.  Raven spots her boat going under  and quickly arrives in time to save her life.  While the storm rages (for  what felt like several days) he nurses her back to health and they fall in  love.  But it's not as easy as all that because they both have wounded  hearts and must first come to grips with their old heartaches and  insecurities before they can love each other freely.<br /><br />This was an okay  read but it just didn't grab me.  The hero was a perfectly sensitive,  nurturing and tortured guy and the heroine was pretty likable but they had  big trouble communicating with each other and spent a huge chunk of the  book hiding and avoiding their feelings.  I also had a bit of a problem  with the speed in which relationship developed.  I realize this is a short  book but their love seemed to blossom unbelievably quick. There were tons  of steamy love scenes but I kind of wish they had spent more time talking  than tearing up the sheets.  Geez, what a bore I'm becoming :)  And the  final thing that bugged me were all of the references to what I believe  must have been the prequel about a woman (Angel) who broke the hero's  heart.  I can't help but think that I would've felt more compassion for  Raven if I had read that story first.	1998-08-23

This book has everything I could hope for in a romance. It's a beautifully written love story, is intensely moving, and has deep, layered and completely developed characters. I enjoyed everything about it.<br /><br /> It's a story about forbidden love and also one about faith. Geoffrey D'Aubrey returns as Lord to the home he ran from as a child. With him he brings his wife. His beautiful, cynical, lonely and battered wife Anne. War and soldiering are the only things Geoffrey truly loves. Before they've barely moved in he leaves Anne to fight another senseless battle. He leaves his horse and her (and in that order) in the care of his childhood friend Christy - a minister.<br /> Christy is gentle, kind, caring, loving and he and Anne become fast friends despite their differences in faith (she's an atheist). They have a great time joking about their differences and are open and honest with each other. Despite their attempts to avoid and deny it they fall in love but are both such!  honorable people they refuse to do anything about it - until Geoffrey is reported dead. But before they can live happily ever after they must struggle through some horribly bleak times.<br /> I ached for this couple as they suffered through so much darkness and pain. This book is so good that it haunts me still. I don't say this often, and haven't said it in a long while, but if you haven't read this already go find it immediately.	1998-08-05

SAVAGE SEASON is a fast-paced, hard-boiled suspense novel about two hardworking friends, Hap and Leonard, who can't resist the opportunity to make a quick $200,000 a piece.  All they have to do is find the money that is supposedly buried somewhere in an icy river where Hap grew up.  But nothing comes easy for these two and it isn't long before they're not only dealing with vicious weather but also greedy and psychotic humans.<br />This is a short little book that packs a punch.  It is unflinchingly and sometimes painfully graphic but the characters of Hap and Leonard, who both have a really nasty sense of humor, provide much needed comic relief.  I don't want to give too much away here but this book isn't going to become one of my favorites, even though I enjoyed most of it, because of a certain horrendous plot twist towards the end of the story that tore out my heart.	1998-06-14

And even though it wasn't heavy on the romance and was more plot than character driven (my usual preference) I literally could not put it down.<br /> Thalassa, born and raised as an Amazon warrior, is happy with her life. It isn't an easy one and her people are constantly at war with men but she is free. Fighting and protecting her sisters is what she lives for - until the day she is abducted by Dorian, King of the Merfolk, who sweeps her away to his world under the sea. She is furious and despises him immediately but tempers her rage when she realizes that her Goddess has ordained their match. Eventually this gentle God-like man with super human powers begins to tear down her defenses with kindness, fairness and patience and allows her to accept her fate and his love. But she never forgets her beloved Amazon sisters. And when she overhears that their lives are in danger she and Dorian risk everything to enter the battle.<br /> Filled with historical and fantasy details that I've never before read about, I learned so many amazing things about the strong but doomed ancient tribe of woman warriors known as the Amazons and the mythical Merfolk who created a peaceful life under the sea. Interspersed with the fantasy elements are rich historical details of daily life and survival in those brutal times where women were little more than slaves. There were several sub-plots and secondary characters that were all equally riveting and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. This book is brutal and heartbreaking and filled with three-dimensional characters. It's not light and it's not funny and it's not my typical reading material but if you find it do not pass it by, it is a truly incredible book. An unforgettable one.	1998-06-14

She thinks he's going to kidnap her but he only has her safety on his mind - oh and her lips.  Lips that he can't resist kissing before he reels her into safety and then disappears from her life. In the span of several minutes she's afraid, furious, charmed, aroused, then left aching as this most fascinating, gorgeous man has the gall to just walk away!  But not for long . . .<br /> It turns out that Serena's mystery man is none other than Fitzgerald (Gerald) Crosbie who has come to fetch his sister Annabelle from the clutches of the no-good sea captain (who just happens to be Serena's brother!) who has spirited her away.  However, Annabelle doesn't need nor want rescuing.  She's married and very pregnant and insists that her beloved brother Gerald stick around at least until she has the baby. He agrees and is continually put in close contact with Serena - the one woman who he can't put out of his mind.<br /> Gerald is the third son of a titled family and because of this has all of the luxuries but none of the responsibilities of a first son.  And he likes it that way.  Up until now he has spent his days spending money, wandering from one exciting place to another and just having a grand old time for himself.  He doesn't want to settle down but as he spends more time with Serena and her quiet paced life he begins to appreciate, for the first time, friendship, hard work and the joy in everyday things. But he's never seen love, was never shown affection as a child and does not want to become attached to Serena or she to him.  She's a smart woman and doesn't want to spend her life pining away for a man who won't be sticking around - so she's avoided any kind of romantic entanglement - until Gerald.  Heck, he's impossible to resist, even her dog loves him immediately which says more about his character than she's willing to admit!  When they are caught in a compromi! sing position they're forced to deal with the consequences and face up to their true feelings.<br /> This is the part where a few &quot;big misunderstandings&quot; occurred that I could've done without.  They were pretty good friends at this point but were so confused about their own feelings that they jumped to conclusions instead of talking things out.  There was a time (or two) when I wanted to scream at the both of them to communicate but those spots were over with before I became too aggravated.  I guess my heart just didn't want them separated for any reason and I wanted them both to be deliriously happy as soon as possible.<br /> Despite that one minor quibble I pretty much loved this book.  It's richly detailed with tons of little nuances that really bring the New England setting to life. It is a slower paced romance than most.  Usually slower means boring to me but not this time.  Not at all.  The characters were interesting because they came from two completely different walks of life and had such a different outlook on things and they also had wit, intelligence and a natural sweetness that was irresistible.  The hero turned out to be a real sentimental guy (although he'd probably never admit it!) and did a few things that made me sigh because they were so sweet.  I was completely immersed in their world, sucking up each word until I got to the last page.  CRANBERRY POINT wasn't the most sizzling book I've ever read, in terms of sexual tension, but the author more than made up for it with the gently developed and caring relationship that grew between the characters so that when they finally did give in to their desires it was all the more intense because I knew they were in love. All in all a very good read and one I can without hesitation recommend.  Oh, and there is a terrific doggie character who plays a pretty important role in the story too!

Kyle Stephens has wanted to be a part of his neighbor Jade Stevens life ever since he first laid eyes on her sexy bod.  She fascinates him with her witty snubs to his blatant come-ons and her apparent disinterest in him only incites him all the more.  When he comes across her very private journal of sexual fantasies at a yard sale he thinks he's finally found a way to get her into his bed.  He proceeds to fulfill each one of her fantasies and eventually wears down her defenses.  But his plan may blow up in his face if she ever discovers what he's been up to . . .<br /> This is one knockout sensual read!  The plot is one I hadn't read before and it's simply sizzling.  The characters are fun, witty and likable people and the story really zipped along.  Jade is a realistic heroine who has been emotionally damaged in the past and fears opening up to another man and Kyle is one those rare breed of heroes who are persistent, patient and willing to put their honey's pleasure before their own.  If you demand good character and relationship development along with steamy love scenes I think you're going to love Private Fantasies.  I sure did!	1998-06-02

Great relationship driven book	Lovers Grey and Mariah are compatible in every way so he's a bit thunderstruck when she refuses to move in with him.  She wants marriage and children and a life-long commitment.  All of the things he is unable to give her because of his atrocious childhood - a childhood filled with hurt and degradation that he will not share with anyone. She loves him deeply but is unwilling to give up her dreams of a family and knows that is exactly what will happen if she stays with him.  Even though it breaks her heart she ends things immediately.  I really liked that about her.  She loved Grey, loved him deeply, but had the strength to let him go when she realized they both wanted very different things out of life.<br /> Grey, who's never been without a date, let alone dumped by a lover, won't accept her giving him the old heave `ho.  He's handsome, sexy (and boy does he use it to his advantage &lt;g&gt;), and successful.  He's quite a catch and has woman drooling all over him but he doesn't want them, doesn't even want to look at them.  He misses Mariah terribly and can barely function without her.  He's also honest and won't give her false promises that he's afraid he can't keep.  He can't let her go either so he woos her and uses his stunning sensuality in an attempt to win her back.<br /> I enjoyed the characters and this story a whole bunch.  Grey is a lovable jerk. He's arrogant, he's real pushy and to say he's persistent is an understatement.  But he's also honest, sweet and caring which is why I liked him right away despite his manly faults.  Watching his heartfelt attempts to win back  the heroine were a delight.  It's always fun watching an overly confident man grovel.  This is truly a relationship driven story, with strong characterization, that most definitely lives up to it's \\"Blaze\\" standards with it's steamy sexual tension.	1998-05-28

It was cute and charming and so easy to read. The story was filled with interesting and vivid details of the historical period but it was the characters who made the story.  They both grew up surrounded by the worst kind of relationships and it did affect their outlook on life but didn't make them bitter people.  Their banter is humorous and natural and their attraction and love for each other is heartfelt and undeniable.<br /><br />My only complaint comes towards the very end of the book.  Up until this point the characters had been pretty open with their feelings, even as confused as they sometimes were, but the author suddenly resorted to a &quot;&quot;lack of communication/big misunderstanding&quot; plot device that tore the couple apart for a few months then wrapped everything up neatly with an epilogue written in first person by the heroine.  I thought the epilogue/letter was a neat idea but I would've liked to have *seen* the couple resolve a few things rather than be *told* how everything worked out in two short pages.  Despite that little nitpick I thought LUCKY STARS was a terrific love story, one of the better ones I've read this year and I can easily recommend it.	1998-05-27

They were always honest with each other.  They shared their pasts, they talked about things, they understood and accepted each other as they were.  I really liked that.  Fear and pain kept them from committing throughout the book not misunderstandings.<br /> This isn't a comfortable book to read.  It's set in a whorehouse and is filled with violent, dirty images.  The author writes so well you can see and smell the countryside and feel the moments of tranquillity the hero shares with the heroine but on the downside you also see, smell and experience the filth and vile acts  that she doesn't shy away from writing about. It's a rough, realistic and oftentimes heartbreaking depiction of the lives of woman who sell their bodies for various reasons.  But throughout it all the love story remains tender and loving.<br /><br />This isn't a story I'd normally read.  I like light and funny these days.  The dialogue isn't witty, and I honestly didn't like the plot but for some odd reason I could not put the book down.  Never  did I feel the urge to start skimming. I know why too, it's because I cared about these people. I liked the hero and heroine, their honesty, their motivations, and their blossoming feelings were all so real and so raw.  And two of the sympathetically drawn secondary characters really tugged at my heart. I wouldn't want to read this type of plot often, that's for sure, but I do recommend this book because the love story is well developed and believable.	1998-05-12

But his soul doesn't actually die, only his memories.  He's taken over to an alternate universe and turned into the best &quot;White Knight&quot; and has dedicated his life to banishing the world of evil.  His next and most important battle is to save an unborn child who has the power to change the world.<br /><br /> Ren (as he's now called) has fought evil for centuries but only eight months has passed on earth.  Annie, alone and eight months pregnant, has been attempting to hide her grief for the sake of her family and has been sort of sleepwalking through life waiting for Richard to come back to her.  One stormy night her dreams come true when he arrives just in time to save her life.  But although this man looks, speaks, and acts just like her husband he insists his name is Ren and that he is only there to protect her unborn child from evil. Annie refuses to believe this and insists that he has just lost his memory.  And eventually bits and pieces of Ren's previous life with Annie do come back to him and he falls in love with her all over again but because of vows he's taken to the &quot;Light Side&quot; he can't stay and refuses to break her shattered heart again.  So he doesn't reveal that he's her Richard and tries to concentrate on keeping her and their baby safe.<br /><br /> This is a moving paranormal love story with a standard plot of good versus evil.  Although the heroine's grief is heart-breaking and the couple's rediscovery of their lost love is touching and done very well  the paranormal plot was extremely predictable and the villain was obvious from the beginning.  Annie's Hero is a very good book but I've read others by her that are far more original.	1998-04-27

When further attempts are made on her life he moves in to protect her and ends up falling in love with her dogs and, although it scares the<br /> heck out of him, her.<br /><br /> This is one of my favorite Crusie books.  The heroine is easy to identify with as she has a perpetual bad hair day throughout most of the book.  The hero looks tough, and tries to act tough but is a big marshmallow on the inside, especially when dealing with Lucy and her dogs.  When he brings her a special gift I was a goner - and so was she.  There's a lot of humor, love and touching moments in this great book.  I had a blast reading it.	1998-04-26

On a mission to save a possible pack of wolves from being ruthlessly murdered by over-eager officials she travels to the wilderness where she gets caught up in a blizzard that slams her automobile into a snowbank, bonks her head and knocks her out cold.  Luckily Morgan, a compassionate werewolf and real hunk of a man, is nearby witnessing the accident.  He digs her out, brings her to his home and saves her life.  When she regains consciousness she's finds herself facing the biggest, hairiest looking man she's ever met but underneath all of that hair she spies two of the most beautiful and haunted eyes she's ever seen.<br /> The ongoing storm makes travel impossible so she's stuck with weird Morgan who locks himself up at night, plays disturbing music and has the oddest visitors who seem oblivious to the storm.  Soon she begins to suspect that Morgan is hiding a thing or two from her and she becomes desperate to get back home but is torn and a bit reluctant to leave the lonely man who sets her blood to boiling.  And Morgan's got to do everything in his power to keep her safely with him, for just a few more days, before his enemies can destroy her and so he'll be able to perform a ceremony that'll put an end to his tortured way of life.  Oh, and in order for the ceremony to work he's got to make her fall in love with him - kind of a hard feat to accomplish when he's keeping her prisoner!<br /> This was an appealing plot for a werewolf fan like myself but those looking for an emotional love story will most likely be disappointed.  The couple have an electric sensual attraction but they don't have conversations.  He orders her to stay put because of the dangers outside and she continually defies him and goes outside and gets herself into trouble anyway.  The book also lacked those precious tender moments that show the reader they're falling deeply for each other.  The few fun encounters they had were more sexual than relationship enhancing (not that that's a bad thing but I do like a blend of the two).<br /> Those complaints aside I just want to reaffirm that I did enjoy the book and think all of you werewolf/weird stuff fans should check it out.  Although this wasn't an emotionally engaging story, it was easy to read and kept me interested. The hero was a great tortured werewolf/alpha-guy and I liked reading about his dogs.  The villianess was very bad bordering on psychotic and I was never sure what she was going to do next.

I hate writing reviews about books like Texas Destiny because I know I can't do them justice with my measly vocabulary.  Saying it made me laugh, cry, ache and that I never wanted it to end just doesn't seem like enough.<br /> The plot revolves around two characters who don't know how to communicate.  They keep their feelings inside, and tip-toe around other.  This type of storyline will normally drive me insane but because Heath gets you into the heads of her people so skillfully you don't question their insecurities and faults.  I understood, sympathized, ached and got frustrated right along with them - but never at them.  And at no time did I get the urge to pound them over the head with something.  Heath has a way of making me instantly fall in love her characters even though (or maybe because?) they are not perfect.<br /><br />One of the best things about this series is the strong sense of family and the fact that her characters grow and change but don't suddenly turn into different people from one book to another.  Dallas's brothers' Austin and Houston and his loving family are a big part of this story and provide humor and poignancy to an already deeply emotional love story.<br /><br />I can count on one hand the number of romances that kept me so riveted that I couldn't close my eyes until I turned the last page (coincidentally one of them is Heath's TEXAS DESTINY). I immediately fell into this story and about ¾'s of the way in I was sobbing like a fool.  I still remember the characters names a day later without notes (an amazing feat for my feeble brain, believe me) and their lives and personalities still linger in my mind.  I wrapped up the book about 12:00 am last night and today I'm dead tired but it was worth it!  I easily give this book my highest rating, it touched me deeply and is one of those rare books that I'm forever searching for and seldom find.	1998-04-17

At certain points I couldn't turn the pages fast enough but then something would happen and I'd lose interest, discover my mind wandering, and find it all too easy to put the book down.  It might be because I just wasn't interested in the mystery element of the plot and that I figured it out way too early (the villain was very obvious) but I'm not sure that was it.  I just feel that the book (at almost 400 pages) was too long.<br /> I'm glad I finished it for several reasons.  I appreciated the steady characterization of the hero and heroine.  Both were headstrong and arrogant and basically remained that way throughout the story.  The hero falls for the heroine immediately and that was another plus.  Their sexual attraction was instantaneous and for those of you who like longer, well-written and sensual love scenes you most definitely won't be disappointed in these!  They go on and on, page after breathtaking page.  I admit sometimes I'll skim the second or third lovescene (gasp!) because usually by that time I'm bored of the same old, same old but I was riveted to each and every one of them in this book.  The author sure knows how to set up and carry out a sensual scene.	1998-04-14

He betrays her trust and love by devising a plan to secure a child with another woman! She just can't live with his scheme (and who can blame her?) and picks up the pieces of her shattered heart and begins a new life for herself. She's determined to live life to it's fullest and, knowing she will never be able to have children, she seeks out and takes advantage and great pleasure in all of the sensual adventures that come her way.<br />  I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The historical setting of the story made it all the more enjoyable and forbidden. The heroine is a realistic and strong character who goes after who she wants with a vengeance. She's not always likable and does some wicked things but under it all I felt she had a good heart. She seemed to prefer schooling young inexperienced males and females in the arts of love but does eventually meet her match in the form of a mysterious man who follows her on her travels and drives her wild each time their paths cross. There's nothing that I found overly kinky in this book. There are plenty of m/f, f/f, and group sex scenes. And all were written with a very sensual touch.	1998-04-04

She's taken prisoner and made a slave of a brutal warrior who despises &quot;the filthy Saxon's&quot;, especially the woman, because he'd been betrayed by one years earlier. He intends to punish her for this past woman's transgressions and instead finds himself becoming her protector. Her innocence and innate sweetness weaken his hardened heart but his jealous mistress attempts to do everything in her power to make his precious Elena suffer sexual torments.<br /> I didn't like these characters very much. Elena had absolutely no back bone and I was annoyed that she fell in love/lust with her brutish captor almost upon first sight. She seemed to have no trouble submitting to an enemy who destroyed everything she'd every known. He did attempt to protect her from his vicious minions but I couldn't understand why she surrendered without putting up any kind of fight and just laid back and let anyone and everyone do whatever they wished with her body. I had no respect for her character and was more interested in the sex lives of the interesting secondary characters.<br /> With all of that out of the way I did enjoy this book on a carnal level. The sex scenes were earthy, gritty and exciting and the historical details were done well enough to place me in the time period the author was writing about. I only wish Elena had been written with a little more spunk, even her thoughts were weak and submissive. There were several f/f and group sex scenes in this story along with several f/m ones and there are a few where the heroine is tied up and helpless. It was sexy reading but just don't expect to feel any sympathy for the wimpy heroine.	1998-04-04

Anna? Needing to get a fresh start after recently suffering a bad breakup with her insensitive boyfriend accepts the job even though she senses that something is not on the level after an odd interview with her handsome employer. She soon discovers that her real purpose for being in his house is to tutor his virginal nephew in the arts of love-making. Being an open-minded woman she eagerly accepts her new position and surrenders to her passion and learns several interesting things herself.<br />  I enjoyed this book very much and found the two main characters to be extremely likable people. Admittedly, the plot was very thin but who the heck cares when the sex scenes are this exciting! Some were tender and some were very kinky. There were several f/m scenes along with several m/m, some mild S&amp;M, f/f and 3-way sex so if those things offend you be warned.	1998-04-04

In MAGIC, she touched my emotions right off the bat with her portrait of a lonely and scared little girl whose belief in magic and legends is her only solace in an emotionally empty world.  I think I was in tears by page two.  But don't get me wrong this is not a dismal book at all, it's sprinkled with humor and it's oh-so-very touching.  I have no complaints, no nits to pick.  I devoured and loved every second of it.<br /> This story is filled with heart-tugging emotion and three dimensional characters. I really recommend it to those of you who enjoy strong character driven stories that aren't over done with intense intrigue and political subplots galore.  It has a villain but he doesn't take center stage and unlike many villains nowadays he's portrayed as a human with faults rather than a cardboard bad guy.  Even he intrigued me.  Mostly it's a warm, loving and sometimes funny love story.  There was a small group of secondary characters who were drawn so well their plight managed to bring tears to my eyes.  The hero is strong, stubborn, caring and virginal (!) and the heroine is immediately likable and his perfect match.  My favorite thing about her was her realness, she wasn't perfect.  She had a short fuse and was as stubborn as the hero and she never, ever turned into an irritating heroine.  I appreciated that she wasn't suddenly transformed into a paragon of perfection by the novels end too.  I'm tired of the patient, virtuous and tolerant heroine.  This one fibs when put on the spot and ends up getting herself into all sorts of trouble.  She was great as was the entire book.	1998-04-03

The heroine, Leda, comes from a long line of woman who had the &quot;sight&quot;.  When she was just a girl her Mom drew a picture of the man she was going to marry &amp; when she finally meets him she's so excited she nearly knocks him over with her ecstatic kiss.

But she's persistant and before he realizes what has happened she's moved her crystal ball &amp; herbs into his office and soon he realizes he wonders how he ever got along without her.  This was a really cute story, with lots of sweet characters and wow was it ever sensual.  I was a bit surprised by just how sensual it was.  Kane's newer books fall into the sensual category but for some reason I thought the older ones were of the &quot;sweet&quot; variety.  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised ;)	1998-03-29

Tired of reading about over privileged rogues and heroines who seem to do little more than drink tea, gossip and attend balls?  Think the ton needs a good shaking up?  Then imagine the thought of a vampire cavorting amongst the ton, charming the socks off of every woman he gazes at, and getting invites to the most exclusive and sought after clubs and balls.  Karen Harbaugh's hero does all of these things in her story THE VAMPIRE VISCOUNT.<br />  Leonore Farleigh, a governess with an abusive father, agrees to marry the gorgeous and secretive Lord Nicholas St. Vire to get away from her unstable home and secure a better future for her sister.  What she can't figure out is why such a handsome and charming man would want to marry a lowly governess.  As she begins to get to know him she comes to the conclusion that he suffers from some terrible disease that forces him to hide from the sun and her heart begins to break because she's falling in love with him and fears he doesn't have long to live.<br /> Nicholas has reasons of his own for marrying Leonore and falling in love with her was most definitely not one of them.  But fall he does and now he must do everything within his power to protect her when a jealous vampiress from his past returns.<br /> THE VAMPIRE VISCOUNT is great book about a tortured hero who manages to come across as good-humored and charming despite his problem.  He's witty and likable and I'm so glad he wasn't another one of those typical whiny vampires that I'm so sick of.  He and the heroine both had a good sense of humor and I thought they were just perfect for each other.  But poor Leonore does get put through the emotional wringer before the book is over.  I'm going to be on the lookout for more of this author's work because she's imaginative and her writing style is a lot of fun.	1998-03-25

It took a little getting used to but I enjoyed it because I got a first person account of the quirkiness of the characters and their intimate thoughts about a previous scene.  I laughed more than once as his viewpoint ended and then we got to see her real thoughts about the last scene.<br />Victoria is an anthromorph.  A what, you ask?  This means she's a defective werewolf.  Born to two werewolf parents but with a defect that prevents her from shapeshifting, mating and having little werewolves.  But she does have all of the other benefits of a typical werewolf such as heightened senses and extreme beauty.  Because of her disability others in the pack treat her with indifference and blatant prejudice.  She's been passed over for promotions and has had all of her creative ideas stolen from her.  Surprisingly she's not bitter, she just accepts this as her fate since she's been treated this way since birth.  She's a little bit of a doormat but I immediately liked her and once she meets Noah she's anything but passive!<br />Noah's a full-blooded werewolf (and all of his parts work), who's recently been appointed head of the business and will one day be leader of the werewolf pack.  He has some misgivings about the whole thing because up until lately he loved his playboy/slacker lifestyle and now his Grandpere, who doesn't seem to have any confidence in his skills, is making him work like a dog but not giving him any real responsibilities.  When he's assigned to work with Victoria to locate an employee bent on sabotaging the company he figures he being played for a fool.  After all he is the Big Boss and she's a measly peon with little brains, or so he's led to believe - at first.<br /><br />As they begin to spend time together he realizes he and the rest of the pack were all wrong about Victoria.  He soon respects her talent and lusts after her body.  He begins wanting to spend time with her just because he likes being around her and he tells her so.  She's flattered by the attention but thinks he's only trying to get her to do more work, off hours, and is too cheap to pay her overtime.  They start to fall in love and can't keep their hands off of each other but it's a seemingly hopeless cause because of his responsibility to the pack to produce an heir, something Victoria is unable to do.<br /><br />This is a great werewolf romance.  The characters are lovable (although I must admit I had my doubts about the arrogant playboy hero who was a little snobby but the strong woman in the novel didn't let him get away with it and he turned out to be a big softie).  It has a little angst, a little humor and a lot of sensuality.  The love story was developed slowly and the couple become friends before realizing that they were in love, always a plus when one reads a romance.  And I also liked the way the werewolves looked at things so differently from humans.  There were a few scenes where I thought I saw a petty argument and a &quot;big misunderstanding&quot; coming but the author surprised me and avoided it with a fascinating explanation that made lots of sense about the wolves nature.  I did figure out the intrigue part of the story early on but all in all this was an entertaining romance that I feel will appeal to even non-werewolf fans who like a contemporary setting, a working class heroine and a well developed love story.<br />I should probably make note that this book is a sequel to SECRET OF THE WOLF (Silh. Shadows #54) and if you have it you should probably read it first because past occurrences are mentioned several times.

I can always count on Pamela Morsi to write a good-hearted story about everyday people who make me laugh and GARTERS is no exception<br />Esme (short for Esmerelda!) Crabb is the practical one in her family.  Her beautiful twin sisters are a little light in the brains department and her dad is kind-hearted but the laziest man in the county, so the burden of providing for her family is entirely hers.  Determined to make a better life for her and her useless loved-ones she concocts a plan to make the richest man in town marry her.<br />Esme's not a beauty, nor is she refined, being brought up in the &quot;hills&quot; so she has to use her brains to snare Cleavis Rye's attention.  He's the town store-keeper and is one of the best educated men in the land and she figures when he realizes how practical marrying up with her is he'd have to be crazy not to just jump at the chance.  So she follows him around a like a puppy and insinuates her way into his life and before he knows what is happening she's working in his store, flashing her legs at him, driving him insane and ruining his reputation!<br />This book was fun, fun, fun!  I so enjoyed watching the practical Esme lose all common sense when trying to catch herself a man.  She's blunt, honest and funny and I was rooting for her all the way.  It was also amusing to see the prissy talking and sometimes snobby Cleavis lighten up, get all hot and bothered and lose his heart to the most unlikely woman possible.  His nickname for the heroine &quot;Hillbaby&quot; drove me nuts but you can't have everything, can you?  There are no bad guys in GARTERS because Morsi has a gift that manages to turn even the most unlikable character into a real person (Cleavis's Mom comes to mind, as do the twins shifty suitor).  Her books always remain centered on her characters growing love, never getting lost or bogged down with intrigue and action.  And did I forget to mention the incredible sensual tension?!  Whew, this one had plenty of it.  It's the perfect book to brighten up a dank, rainy day or any day for that matter.It's the perfect book to brighten up a dank, rainy day or any day for that matter.	1998-02-20

He has a strong sex drive, he wants children and a strong woman willing to help him rebuild his ranch.  In the heroine's words he wants a brood mare.  He's been burned by his ex-wife who wasn't willing to rough it out as a ranch wife and took half of everything he owned in the divorce settlement, leaving him nearly bankrupt.  So he places an add and gets three measly responses.  Madelyn Patterson is the only applicant who sets his blood boiling but she's all citified and completely wrong for the job - or so he thinks.  His lack of choices, her determination and her sex appeal win her the job and they marry.<br />All of the above takes place right away and the remainder of the book is spent watching Maddie prove to Reese that all woman aren't like his ex-wife.  He's got a lot of baggage to deal with but Maddie handles him with humor and tenderness, two things he isn't used to but over time learns he desperately can't live without.  He is an extreme alpha man, one who wants his wife to give him babies, cook dinner, clean the house, and jump when he snaps his fingers, all without a complaint.  He is overbearing and sometimes he annoyed me but as much as I wanted to give him a swift kick in his pretty rear, I understood why he was this way.  He'd been hurt and destroyed and was only protecting himself and his future children.  So, I could deal with all of his chest pounding and I liked the fact that Maddie handled him maturely and never lowered herself by giving into a fit of whimpiness or &quot;poor me's&quot;.  She didn't out and out tell him off which would not have worked with this guy anyway, but she did it in more subtle ways, getting under his skin and teaching him to love again.  She was an admirable character and the only thing I couldn't figure out was why such a sweet, sensual, twenty-eight year old woman had no steady boyfriend or sexual history previous to meeting Reese.  It wasn't really explained, unless I missed it.  But I'm being nitpicky, I liked this book, the characters were three dimensional, the love scenes were steamy, and most importantly it made me feel.sual, twenty-eight year old woman had no steady boyfriend or sexual history previous to meeting Reese.

Why? Because said sister has stolen her longtime boyfriend and expects kind and understanding Mallory to not only attend the wedding, but to be her maid-of-honor! Mallory is painfully shy around men, but one of her friends introduces her to undercover cop, Brody Hunter. With his long hair, dangerous and stunning looks, he is perfect for the part. And Mallory is told that he's gay, so there is no need to feel insecure around him. Except she does, especially when he insists on going out on &quot;dates&quot; so they can get their act down before the big wedding. She soon wonders if her buddy has lied to her because Brody's acting is becoming quite convincing.<br /> The author hooked me from the first page, creating such lovable characters that I didn't want to put the book down. The story starts out light, sexy and funny, then she adds an ongoing mystery/investigation plot that relies a bit too much on coincidence, but which made for some cute encounters. Despite the suspense thread, the author manages to keep the love story the main focus of the book, which is why it worked so perfectly for me. The characters appear to be your classic mismatch: the shy, frigid schoolteacher and the dark and dangerous cop, but it's quickly revealed that they both have much more depth (and much more in common) than at first glance. A genuine, believable friendship develops before they fall head-over-heels in love. This kind of story wins me over every time! The entire book was a real pleasure to read.	1998-01-28

Desolate after losing his wife, child, and family, and rejected by his people because of his visions, Lonewolf seeks solace from the stars. He is transported through time to the modern-day world, where he meets Willow, a police officer who is half Navajo. His powers, when combined with hers, can help save the life of one very important and deathly ill little boy.<br />  This book was a real page-turner for me because I was never quite sure where it was leading. It had its painful and touching moments, but there was also humor. I bought the entire time-travel idea (and liked how it was resolved in the end), and I admired both of the strong lead characters, who would do anything for the people they loved. STARGAZER is a rather short book and the story takes place in the span of six days, so the relationship between the hero and heroine developed quickly, but it worked for me because the author made me believe they were incomplete without the other. The love scenes are of the sweet variety, but there was enough sexual tension to keep me happy.	1998-01-27

The author spends the majority of the book concentrating on the developing romance between Jesse and Abigail.  They start out absolutely despising each other, they bicker - constantly - but it's not annoying bickering, it's funny (I laughed out loud more than once) and it's believable, then over the course of the book they become friends.  This was a close to perfect book but it wasn't perfect because it was about 80 pages too long, IMO.  About three-quarters of the way through the book Jesse is healed and takes a back seat in the action as the author explores the conflicting emotions in Abigail's head as she considers a proposal from David, the perfect bore, umm, I mean, gentlemen.  Fortunately, the last few chapters were definitely worth hanging in there for.  The historical details were great, I really felt like I was whisked back to 1879, and the dialogue was down-to-earth.  There were so many lines that made me melt, here's one:<br />  &quot;She'd had so little love, he thought, I will drown her in it for the rest of her life&quot;.  This from an alpha hero!

What started out as a fascinating story with compelling characters unfortunately soon turned into one of those &quot;annoying heroine&quot; books. Almost immediately the heroine began to rub me the wrong way because of her selfish and self-centered attitude and it only got worse from there. I continued to read the book because I thought the hero deserved a happy ending. His dark and tortured past was absolutely horrendous and the flash backs broke my heart but alas it was not meant to be because he got saddled with the unlikable heroine for life!

When Aggie learns he is going to be released from the hospital directly to the streets or a homeless shelter she feels so guilty she takes him home (she also has ulterior motives, she's a journalist/columnist suffering from writer's block and will use his recovery as a scoop). Slowly he begins to regain bits and pieces of his past and it's mostly frightening. He fears he's not human and he wills himself to forget but it's impossible with Aggie around arousing his senses, his libido and his, ummm, true self. I fully enjoyed this story. The plot was great fun, with a nice balance of lightness and angst, the hero was scrumptious and the heroine likable. I don't think I will ever tire of reading about werewolf heroes. There was an issue concerning the eventuality of children that I felt was wrapped up way too quickly but overall it's a small complaint because the story was terrific. There is just something so romantic about their mating for life that gets to me every time. This is the first book in a trilogy but it does stand alone quite nicely.	1997-12-30

The plot is pretty basic, it's the characters who make the book so special. They are real people with flaws and insecurities who've been hurt/are afraid to be hurt and fear getting close to each other. They're not annoying, cardboard cutouts and I genuinely liked them. By their actions, thoughts and dialogue the reader gets to see them slowly fall in love. Never once did I pause and think &quot;why the heck is she falling for him/her?&quot; like I usually do. And best of all the hero, who's a bit on the arrogant side and who deserved a whap across his beautiful head a few times, gets tamed and he doesn't even realize it ;) I usually don't care for bossy men but this guy was a heart-stealer and sexy as sin. Although I didn't find this book as &quot;hot&quot; or witty as the author's previous book &quot;A Date With Dr. Frankenstein&quot; I still highly recommend it, especially to those who enjoy character driven stories, it's a feel good read with humor and lots of heart.	1997-12-30

And the rare thing happened, all of my expectations were met and I discovered a new author (King) whose backlist I'm probably going to track down.<br /> The King story [&quot;Snow Rose&quot;] set in the Scottish Highlands is probably my favorite. I found it tender, sensual and gripping and all of the little historical details really placed me in the time period.<br /> The Barnett story [&quot;Boxing Day&quot; - set in Victorian New York] was my second favorite, it was funny and witty, light and really hit the spot, the hero was very lovable and the heroine was an *older* woman.<br /> The Putney story [&quot;The Best Husband Money Can Buy&quot; - set in Regency England] was also great about a woman who buys herself a hubby but I have to admit I was a little bothered by the fact that they were cousins (I know this was acceptable during that time but it still makes me squirm).<br /> The Dare story [&quot;A Light in the Window&quot; - set in late 1800s Wyoming] was good but probably my least favorite because I felt it was too short and that she wasn't given enough space to fully develop her characters. I highly recommend this anthology for those who like 'em.	1997-12-30

Theirs is a delightful<br />relationship full of humor, and tenderness and from the moment they meet<br />you know they belong together.

SURRENDER A DREAM starts out on a serious note when we meet Montana as a young boy and watch his life fall apart. Then the book turns light-hearted as Montana and Addie take drastic measures to rid themselves of each other. Sometimes their tactics are hilarious and other times I wanted to throttle them. As the story ends it again turns serious as they struggle to overcome the toughest obstacle yet in their relationship. At this point, I began to cry and pretty much finished the book with tear glazed eyes. I was completely won over by the strength of both of these characters. As they were falling in love both acted a bit rashly at times and, like most young lovers, a little immaturely but as the story went on they grew and realistically matured right before my eyes. All in all this was a great love story. It made me feel and care deeply for these people and that's what I look for when I pick up a romance.	1997-10-14

WONDERFUL is enchanting, uplifting and has enough history to place you in the world she's created but not enough to feel like a boring history lesson. The details of ale making were fascinating. Her characters are lovable, and the secondary characters are well drawn and add to the fun (I can't wait for Roger's story!). Clio teaches Merrick how to laugh and love and their relationship develops slowly from one of irritation, to friendship, to desire and love. It's all done with such a tender hand that I couldn't stop the tears when I got to towards the end. Speaking of which, it takes an abrupt serious turn which may upset some looking for a pure love and laughter read. For me, this part made the love story all the more poignant. Like all the Barnett books I've read I laughed and cried and completely enjoyed myself. *Sigh* Do I really have to wait 6 months or so for the next one?	1997-10-14

I liked the fact that even though this book was<br />a sequel to a book I haven't read it wasn't bogged down with lots of boring<br />back story, also I loved the fact that Ashley had the compassion to look<br />past Emmy's affliction and see her true self as no one else did.  I just<br />wish the book was more centered on those things than all of the crazy<br />outside conflicts.  My main complaint is that it started out so darned good<br />and I truly cared about the characters and could not put it down but<br />towards the end I wasn't feeling much of anything, I didn't laugh, I didn't<br />cry, I didn't truly care and just wanted to get the book over with.  I was<br />left feeling very disappointed.  I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one,<br />ah well, we can't all like the same things all the time, I guess	1997-09-07

This book is gutwrenching so be warned, do not attempt to read it<br />without a full supply of tissues.  I was floored by the intensity and the<br />realism the characters exhibit.  They are not perfect super people who<br />handle troubles without a doubt, guilt or worry.  I liked that everything<br />wasn't sugar coated and their thoughts weren't always pretty, they were<br />human, and I always admired both Joe and Allison throughout their story.  I<br />read this book with my stomach in knots and an ache in my heart.  I felt<br />deeply for these characters and wasn't once tempted to skim. Although this<br />is a very serious book there are bits of humor scattered throughout the<br />story and the excerpts of Joe's children's books are charming. A ROSE FOR<br />MAGGIE was a truly incredible story and the ending, wow, it was wonderful!<br />I give this book my highest recommendation with absolutely no reservations.<br /> If you're lucky enough to find this treasure hold on tight to it	1997-09-07

When I heard Dare was taking a different approach to the trilogy<br />- writing them backwards - I decided to take a chance and read her latest<br />FIRE HAWK first.  And I'm real glad I did because, IMO, I think this book<br />should be read first (not to mention it's a WONDERFUL read!).  To my<br />understanding all of these books are related by a mysterious tome that<br />appears in each story when there is only one member of the Hawk line<br />remaining.  This book, FIRE HAWK, explains the origin of the mysterious<br />tome that guides the Hawk family and introduces the characters who began<br />the Hawk line back in the tragic and brutal medieval time period.<br /><br />Jenna and her clan have managed to live in peace for years in<br />their magical glade while the world around them is torn by war and death.<br />But all of that comes to an end when an evil Warlord sets his sights on<br />their glade and slowly begins killing them off as they wander from their<br />safe haven ignorant of what awaits them.  After her Brother is murdered<br />Jenna is named Hawk - leader of the clan - an honor she never wanted.  With<br />this heavy responsibility on her shoulders, fear and anguish in her heart,<br />she realizes the only way to save the few remaining members of her clan is<br />by seeking out the mystical warrior known only as Kane, a man she fears may<br />not even exist except in legends.  She hopes he will teach her people,<br />who've never learned how to fight, how to defend themselves and possibly<br />save their magical land from invasion.<br /><br />Kane has escaped his brutal and haunted past and found solitude on his<br />isolated mountain.  He is less than thrilled when Jenna shows up and asks<br />him to don his warrior garb and help her out.  He repeatedly refuses but<br />her persistent arguments and his increasing attraction to her force him to<br />take drastic measures to get her the heck away from him ASAP.  He's bad for<br />her and he knows it so he offers her a bargain that is sure to have her<br />running in terror.  But he screws up big time because he misjudges her<br />courage and love for her people and she accepts his very ungentlemanly<br />deal.  Now he feels guilty and is in one heck of a mess but he can't take<br />back his offer so he begins her lessons and puts his his heart in danger.<br /><br />Kane and Jenna's love story is not an easy one.  They have a lot of pain<br />and obstacles to face before they can find love but with the help of Kane's<br />gorgeous wizard friend, Tal, they get a little magical push to help them<br />along.  Both are strong, couragous and likable characters.  And although<br />the book is filled with adventure the story never loses focus of the love<br />story.  The sensual tone and the heartwrenching emotions it tugged out of<br />me kept me anxiously turning the pages and dropping everything to get back<br />to the book.  If I have anything to complain about it would be that Tal's<br />interesting past is never fully explained.  I'm going to be really bummed<br />if Dare doesn't write his story!!!

Very Highly Recommended 4 1/2 stars out of 5<br />Love scenes:  Not a lot of 'em but they're sensual<br /><br />I adored Kathleen Kane's last novel (A POCKETFUL OF PARADISE) which had me falling for a grim reaper hero!  Her newest hero is on the opposite side of the spectrum.  He's a ghost/guardian angel who also turns out to be quite the cupid!  Jackson Tate's life ended much too early when he was shot by a cold blooded gambler.  Having spent the majority of his life in shady saloons, Jackson is not quite suited for Heaven, but he hasn't done anything bad enough to deserve the torments of Hell, so he remains stuck haunting the saloon where his life ended.  When his superiors order him to rescue an orphaned girl, who's family has perished in a carriage accident, he jumps at the chance thinking his eternity in limbo has finally ended.  But he messes up big time when he forgets to wipe the incident from young Rachel's memory.<br />&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />Fifteen years later he is offered another assignment.  This time he has six weeks to find Rachel Morgan a husband to get her pregnant because she is fated to have some very important children the first of which is due to arrive next Spring!  Armed with six magical coins he thinks this task will be a snap.  Until he meets Rachel who has grown into a beautiful but stubborn and opinionated woman who has frightened off the most ardent of suitors. &lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />Rachel, founder of the Stillwater Spinster Society, which has set the gossipy town on it's ear, is single, prosperous and wants to stay that way.  She believes there is only one man for her, the *angel* she gave her heart to years earlier and refuses to settle for anyone less.  She's given up on the idea that he will return and has resigned herself to spinsterhood.  When Jackson finally returns, only to tell her she must marry some man - any man will do - in order to have that all important baby she is furious!  So, Jackson decides to start using those magic coins of his but instead of marrying her off he screws up his wishes and manages to play cupid for all of her spinster friends instead!  Now, the only spinster left in Town, she is royally ticked off!!  And to top it all off she is having feelings for her angel/ghost who insists on marrying her off so he can leave her again.  Not even his magic will save his non-beating heart when he starts having some of those same feelings towards her. . .&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />Sounds like an impossible plot doesn't it?  But it works.  Wow, does it work.  After reading too many romances lately that lost track of the romance this book was like the first gorgeous spring day after a dark crummy winter.  All of the characters (except for the villain, of course) were so likable with all of their idiosyncrasies and insecurities. &lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this book is the fact that the characters aren't perfect.  The hero doesn't start out as your perfect politically correct hero cleaned up for the 90's and he gets a real rude awakening when he meets Rachel and her friends.  After getting a bucket of muck dumped upon his head he wonders,  &quot;Where were all the weepy, weak women he'd known when he was alive?&quot;  It's moments like this that made these characters so realistic and charming. &lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />Kane knows how to tug at my emotions. Not only is this book funny, in a gentle kind of way, but it's also tender and emotional.  I got to know the characters and really felt them falling deeply in love which was a joy after reading lots of bod lusting, love/hate and action type supposed romance books.  There's no lack of romance in this romance that's for sure.  Some of the scenes are so heartbreakingly sweet I could barely read the words because my eyes were all misted over.  A book that can do that to me is a book that reminds of why I love the genre so much and it's a book that I can recommend without reservation.  I'm gushing, I know it, but I just loved this book. &lt;/p&gted this book. &lt;/p&gt	1997-06-26

I could say it's set in post civil war Texas and is a mail order bride story, and part road romance and it could even be classified as a beauty and the beast tale but that doesn't even begin to touch on the emotional impact of Ms. Heath's newest work. This book touched me from beginning to end and is a book I'll always treasure.  It's also the first of a trilogy - Yayyy! <BR> <BR> Houston Leigh's brother Dallas has broken his leg so he's unable make the trip to pick up his mail order bride-to-be Amelia Carson.  Houston has hideous facial scarring on one side of his handsome face and has lived his adult life hiding in shadows and covering his face with his hat.  He has shunned human contact and feels most content in the company of his horses. Because of his scars and less than charming personality Dallas feels it's safe to assume his new bride won't fall for his brother during the three week trek. <BR> <BR> Amelia is disappointed that she has to spend three weeks with her fiance's grouchy brother but tries to make the best out of her situation by trying to engage him in conversation by bugging him with irritating questions he doesn't want to answer.   Eventually she gets under his skin and although it scares him he slowly opens up to her and they form a hesitant friendship which gets stronger as the days pass and they reveal bits of themselves to each other. Both of their lives have been shattered by the war and they've both dealt with it differently. He has given up on his dreams and withdrawn from the world while she is the eternal optimist finding something to be grateful for in every situation, she looks at her future with joy waiting to make her dreams a reality.  She even manages to find a dream for Houston to believe in but they despair because she is promised to his brother . . . <BR> <BR> The hurting and lovable characters make this story so memorable.  I've found in the majority of romances I've read that one character usually really comes alive while another is not as well drawn.  Well, I loved the heroine as much as the hero in TEXAS DESTINY.  She's a woman who has seen the worst life can do to a person but hasn't been beaten down by it.  Her optimism and willingness to embrace life is refreshing _and_ believable.  And Houston . . . he's my favorite kind of hero.  He's a wounded soul, he's got lots of integrity, he's serious,  heroic, and best of all is sensitive.  He's been dealt a raw deal by life and really needs a hug.  This book is so realistic: there is no witty banter during their first few days together but there are lots of awkward attempts at conversation and long silences, and Houston's trying to desperately come up with words to charm Amelia but always coming up empty was so endearing. <BR> <BR> I know many readers avoid the Civil War period but this book is less about the war and more about the healing of two people who as children had to bear witness to human nature's darkest side.  But don't think it's all darkness and pain though!  The book is filled with so many tender moments my eyes were stinging and it has a quiet wit that made me smile.  The longing, the soft caresses, the hot kisses, the despair and the impossible love these two share made my heart ache but somehow they always managed to maintain their senses of humor.  And the sense of place is done so well I felt like I was living the story.  I stayed up late reading with a flashlight until 12am last night because I just didn't want to put this book down.  This is _very_ rare for me - since I get up at 5am! I'm a zombie today but boy was it ever worth it	1997-06-10

It is now May of 2011 and I have recently reread this, many years after my initial reading and am posting my current thoughts which are no longer quite so gushing and forgiving as my review from 1997.<br /><br />In The Killing Dance Anita Blake discovers someone has put out a serious hit on her life, she's still torn between Richard the werewolf and Jean Claude the vampire and she's drawn deeply into the tangled politics of the were-pack.  There's isn't much in the way of police work, just a lot of pack power struggles, increased sensual tension and a visit from Edward.  Ahhh, Edward's here so I can deal with the lack of Anita working.  She needs a bit of a break after Bloody Bones anyway.<br /><br />If Bloody Bones was Jean Claude's book then the beginning of this one is Richard's but that isn't necessarily a good thing for those of us who were rooting for the werewolf.  We get to know him better and he shows a lot of weakness and protests his nature far too much.  Anita tries to toughen him up and he gives it a go only because he loves her but his heart doesn't seem to be in it.  Poor Richard, I wish he had stopped with all the protesting and given in completely to his baser nature sooner, if only to get on with things, because even I'll admit that it made me like him less as a character in this book.<br /><br />Anita really has her mean on in this book.  She is very unforgiving bordering on cruel on more than one occasion.  I don't remember her being quite so hard in the earlier novels and she's totally lost her dark sense of humor.  She still sleeps with her little stuffed penguin but she's got a mean streak and she's not afraid to let it show.  I found myself emphasizing with her less and less as the book went on and near the end I started to actively dislike her.  This book is where the series dips Anita's petite little toe into the world of sex and power and her old life of animating and being an \\"almost\\" regular girl comes to a sad end. *sniff*<br /><br />This one should really get a 3 1/2.  It's better than a 3 but it aggravated me too much to earn a full out 4.<br /><br />**My original review from 1997 in all its cringe worthy fangirliness.  Feel free to giggle at my expense:<br /><br />Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Extraordinare, is back with another spellbinding adventure that is full of unexpected twists and some eye opening and jaw dropping turns! This time Anita is once again up to her ears in bloody bodies but in addition to her usual corpse raising and vampire slaying she's also being hunted down by the best Assassin money can buy. She's got to figure out who has put such a high price on her head and why. As if this isn't enough to worry about Anita's love life is a major mess. She's torn between her growing attraction and affection for Jean Claude, the sexier than sin Master Vampire who tempts her with his every word, and her loyal and gorgeous werewolf boyfriend Richard who wants marriage and a normal life. Unfortunately, neither is willing to share her on a permanent basis. I can't say enough good things about this sexy and witty series of books. They've got great dialogue, fast paced plots, fascinating characters and _incredible_ sexual tension. Instead of petering out and getting stale like some series do these books just keep heating up! I really love the way Ms. Hamilton is slowly developing these characters and revealing new surprises with each book. The adventures, magic, gore, and creatures are a big attraction for me but the reason I eagerly turn the pages is to delve into these fascinating characters lives and watch the new developments in their ongoing menage.Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Extraordinare, is back with another spellbinding adventure that is full of unexpected twists and some eye opening and jaw dropping turns!<br /><br />This time Anita is once again up to her ears in bloody bodies but in addition to her usual corpse raising and vampire slaying she's also being hunted down by the best Assassin money can buy.

Eight years earlier the love of his life shattered his dreams and he's made a vow that he will never open his heart again.  Besides this little obstacle there are many other things conspiring to keep these two apart:  murder charges, stubbornness, miscommunication, insecurity, another suitor, a tragic accident involving a family member and some more miscommunication.<br /><br />Readers will admire the way Violette struggles to pull herself up out of the dregs of society and become a real Lady but may tire of some of the choices she makes and the lack of communication between this couple.  The hero is sweetly protective of the heroine and a man devoted to his family but he has one heck of time admitting to his feelings when it comes to matters of the heart.  The sexual tension and love scenes are tamer than the previous Joyce book I've read so readers looking for a sweeter story will not be disappointed with this gut-wrenching and tear-jerking readitting to his feelings when it comes to matters of the heart.

On the way to the shelter she is attacked by a ruthless vampire and transformed into one of the undead. <BR> <BR> Jameson Bryant's life has been haunted by the evil DPI (Department of Paranormal Investigations/vampire killers) because he has a rare blood type that will allow a vampire to transform him into a creature of the night.  He escapes from their clutches but during this last set of tests they happen to take more than just Jameson's blood.  They've take his sperm in order to start their next phase of experiments. <BR> <BR>  Jameson finds Angelica near death suffering from self imposed starvation and although he knows she is dangerous something about her calls out to him and he is compelled to help her.  Too hungry to resist what Jameson offers she drinks from him and cannot stop . . .  Just as she realizes she's ended this beautiful, kind man's life a DPI agent shows up and in her fear and confusion she believes him when he says he can make her mortal again.   The DPI fear vampires and it is their intent to exterminate the race.  In their neverending paranoia they discover it may be possible for a newly turned vampire to become impregnated.  Angelica naively becomes their guinea pig in their newest and most heartless experiment to date.  <BR> <BR> Fortunately Jameson's vampire friends show up in time to transform him and when he learns of the results of the DPI's experiments he sets out to find Angelica.  Although she thinks he's a monster and he despises her for cutting his mortal life short they must join forces if they are to save another innocent from the hellish clutches of the DPI.   <BR> <BR> BORN IN TWILIGHT is one of the best books I've read in a long time and the most original and emotional vampire novel I've ever read.  The best thing about this story is the care Ms. Shayne takes to develop the love story and the characters.  She didn't take the easy way out and let them fall into a silly love/hate relationship so prominent in many novels.  The characters struggle and grow and slowly begin to like each other almost against their will.  They were real people and when they fall in love you know it's for eternity.  This romance is the stuff dreams are made of. <BR> <BR> Ms. Shayne's amazing storytelling talent shines in BORN IN TWILIGHT.  The ultimate page-turner, BIT is a not to be missed read for lovers of a fast paced, darkly sensual, deeply emotional, tear jerking story.  Although BIT is a spin-off of her popular Wings In The Night series (for the now defunct Silhouette Shadows line) it very easily stands alone	1997-03-16
