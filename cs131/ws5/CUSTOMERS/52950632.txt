This short book (70 pages of text) is Holmes' essay on the theory, origins of, developmental trajectory of, and end results of both healthy and unhealthy narcissism.  It is remarkably free from jargon, so it is appropriate for the lay person, but also has enough references to guide the college student or early graduate student.  The writing is quite good, in contrast to most of the stuff I have read on narcissism.<br /><br />I also liked the linking of the psychoanalytic concepts in narcissism to examples from literature (Ovid, Oscar Wilde, for example), and, of course, the Greek story itself.<br /><br />This short book took about two hours to read carefully.	2005-10-12

My wife and I found this book very helpful, prior to our first trip to Japan.  We have been somewhat fearful of this trip, because of langugage and obvious cultural differences.  Nevertheless, this  book added to our understanding of current cultural traits, ideas, and ideals in Japan; their historical origins; their meaning to both Japanese and first-visit foreigners; and the countervailing Western forces eroding at the \\"pure strain\\" traits or ideals.  All in all, this book is a fascinating synopsis of Japanese thinking about unique Japanese traits.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that at the end of each brief chapter, the editors have written a number of thought-provoking questions.  These questions ask the reader to expand one's thinking and make clear cross-cultural distinctions.  Besides making the book even more useful to persons like us, these questions also make this book a sure winner in any advanced high school or college class on Japan.	2005-10-07

Truman's book is no exception.<br /><br />It is better than some of the others, however, because he has no axe to grind about humor.  Instead, he points to the \\"Lego\\" building blocks of humor and where one can find them: current events, personal experiences, marriage, travel, sports, church or religion, pets, and so forth.  Truman also spends considerable time describing how to sell humor to people who want it, but he is totally discouraging about how much one will be paid for this.<br /><br />If you are looking for a laugh in this book, you will find a couple; but if you are looking on how to write something laughable, then perhaps this one is it.	2005-08-18

This is a memoir of a driven man--driven to perform, to excel, to understand, to lead others--doing the hardest task on the planet, which is that of defending democracy.  Exum writes about his time from high school, through University of Pennsylvania ROTC, training and Ranger School, through his tour with the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan, and subsequent career-ending injury in a freak sports accident.  He retired as a Captain.<br /><br />This is clearly a man's world, that of finding bravery and a place in the halls of warriors.  Tough, gritty, occasionally humorous, appropriately introspective, devoid of any kind of coddling and women, Exum presents himself modestly, as most driven people might do.<br /><br />This is what my Army friends call a \\"quick read,\\" no less worthy for its speed.  Exum adds to the public knowledge of Ranger training and Afghanistan, and how a handful of American warriors took down a regime whose tribal and religious brutality marked it as pervasively totalitarian.  The reading public will acknowledge Exum as the hero and warrior that he came to be.  Thus, this is also a \\"grateful read,\\" and sets into context the news flashes we get every night on CNN.	2005-08-01

Don Cohen's book testifies to his love of math and kids.  While other reviewers speak of how informative, diverse, and refreshing his book is, I want to make a few brief comments on materials required and what instruction for young children presumes.  (1) Children will have to know about number lines, fractions-to-decimals, and will have to be curious.  (2) This is definitely not a remedial book for the un-curious.  (3) The methods in this book are really for small group tutorials. (4) This book requires that the teacher understand high school geometry and algebra.  (5) It is very helpful to have graphing calculators or a computer that kids can use to write programs in BASIC.  (6) Students will learn about (in no particular order) topics in measurement, number theory and number patterns, algebraic thinking, geometric reasoning, and a little bit about graph theory.  These materials are not simply about calculus.<br /><br />Some of the more powerful things that children will learn are: (1) indexing of numbers; (2) fractions; (3) programming in BASIC; (4) iteration; (5) exponents, and e; (6) ratios (such as t he golden ratio, etc.).  I had the hardest time with (7) continuing fractions, which are rarely taught these days and which, to me, are not intuitive.<br /><br />Perhaps the word \\"intuitive\\" sums up Cohen's approach:  his skills at math are sufficient enough that he can see connections and help youngsters intuit connections, which are then their \\"discoveries.\\"  He does not mind youngsters making mistakes, and he believes in constructionist math.<br /><br />I used Cohen's materials in a summer program with first graders, to solve Zero's Paradox, which, in calculus terms is:  What is the limit of the sum of (1/2)^nth power?  It took five weeks of daily discussion to help them learn about fractions, adding fractions, fractions less than one, graphing the sum, and understanding the idea of when \\"close enough\\" is a \\"good enough\\" limit.  We had a great time and the youngsters enjoyed the project.ct.	2005-06-29

Usually when one writes a negative review, Amazon readers say the review was not helpful.  Also, Amazon tends to make their \\"spotlight reviews\\" the good ones.<br /><br />This book is a decidedly mixed bag.  On the positive side: the author clearly identifies the schtick of famous comedians; he has made up exercises to \\"practice\\" the steps one needs to take to be \\"funny;\\" he makes good comments about how to be a writer or comedian in the public spotlight.  So this is a technically competent book.<br /><br />Yet little of the humor in the book is actually funny, or at least to my taste funny.  I never thought Jack E. Leonard was funny, I detested Don Rickles' aggressive and demeaning \\"humor;\\" Rodney Dangerfield was significantly depressed so I always felt sick when I heard his jokes; Jackie Gleason was a self-involved fat turkey who did not like women, etc., etc.  Yet we can see where Helitzer's favorite comics come from: his theory is that humor \\"is about superiority.\\"<br /><br />So much for irony, understatement, significant pauses, or just treating people to something funny.	2005-05-29

Joy does work on Mathematica 5.1, however, the current version, and it runs on both Mac and PC platforms (OS X for the Mac and Windows XP for the PC).<br /><br />Joy is a wonderful compilation of program-based notebooks that shorten the time-to-use Mathematica dramatically, for both novice and computer-savvy students and learners.

The math in this book will not intimidate the reader, and the general audience with a high school algebra or geometry course can find something interesting in almost all portions of the book.  (It was here that I learned that pi is not simply \\"irrational,\\" it is also \\"transcendental\\"--that is, not capable of being a root of any algebraic formula.)  The time format runs from 2000 BC to 1970s AD, when computers could be developed and used in order to compute values of pi.  My little PC can compute 3000 digits of pi in less than a second, using Mathematica.<br /><br />I had only one reservation about the book, which is the author's abhorence of organized religions.  He states several times that Christianity held science and math back through the post Roman Empire era until the Englightenment ages.  He is harshest on Christianity, but he also reserves a few hard barbs for the Persian and Muslim leaders.  I thought that the author's heartfelt views on religion distracted the reader from his mathematical insights about Pi.<br /><br />Amazon also sells a competing book, Alfred S. Posamentier and Ingmar Lehmann, Pi:  A biography of the world's most mysterious number (Prometheus Books, 2004).  That book has more \\"real\\" math in it, and less about the role of organized religion.	2005-02-26

I wish I had known about this summary when I was taking my Fundamental Concepts in Math course at the university.  I would have done a lot better!  I agree with the previous reviewer about adding REA's Problem Solver book for a complete set.<br /><br />The topics covered include: (1) Sets and relations, (2) Functions, (3) Cardinality and Order, (4) Topology of the line and plane, (5) Topological Spaces, (6) Bases and Subbases [sic], (7) Continuity and topological equivalence, (7) Metric and normed spaces, (8)Countability, (10) Separation axioms, (11) Compactness, (12) Product spaces, (13) Connectedness, (14) Complete metric spaces, and (15) Function spaces.  There is an appendix about Properties of real numbers.<br /><br />This is a technical book and not for a casual reader.  I believe this will be difficult for a teach-yourself-to-know reader, unless the reader has considerable math experience.<br /><br />Another book that I found helpful in Fundamental Concepts (not simply Topology) was Courant et al., What is mathematics? 2nd ed.<br /><br />My Fundamental Concepts professor taught the course with only lecture notes, and I was completely lost.  Had I had this outline, I think I would have done better, because this Outline has a number of solved problems and exercises.<br /><br />Good luck.	2005-01-08

It is a no-frills, basics package that all students can master, if they take the time.  I agree with the previous reviewer that students should make flash cards of definitions and theorems, but doing problems simultaneously, section-by-section, will not hurt.<br /><br />For students, this is a good book to practice basic math study skills: (1) predict what you are going to learn by skimming, (2) survey the material, (3) question the material (what do I not know now?) (4) read (no more than 45 minutes at a setting -- or you'll get a brain cramp), (5) recite (from your outline and flash cards, and (6) review and prepare for your test.  This book is well written but for new geometry students, it can be pretty dense, so you should practice reading and concentrating every day, up to 45 minutes at a setting.<br /><br />I found two problems with the book: (1) It says on the cover that it covers \\"solid\\" geometry.  It does not.  All the geometry is in 2 dimensions. (2) It says that it covers analytic geometry.  It touches analytic geometry only peripherally.<br /><br />Good luck!	2004-11-10

Robert MacKenzie is an educational psychologist who has specialized in handling school-related discipline problems.  This is his third book.  It is the best book that I have seen relating to what parents and teachers can do to help youngsters learn how to behave well.  Among its best parts: \\"detoxifying\\" \\"bad\\" kids into \\"aggressive learners\\" (those who challenge limits constantly), and \\"disobedient\\" kids into \\"kids who learn by testing and experience.\\"<br /><br />This book is appropriate for all teachers, school administrators who have site responsibility, and perhaps for central administrators who need help building a coherent system-wide set of policies on discipline.  This book also will assist parents in handling their children's school-related discipline issues, such as homework.<br /><br />The theoretical bases of this book are partly tough love (say what you mean, mean what you say, and do not say it meanly), natural consequences (if a child makes an error, let them experience the natural consequences, a la Dreikurs), and logical consequences (to defuse power struggles).  The heart of the book is setting limits with kids and shortening down the time from discussion to action (from warning to consequence).  There is no \\"cute\\" theory or exhortations to love the children more.<br /><br />MacKenzie sees teachers as integral to the guidance process, as more capable in helping children than the administrators or guidance counselors, who may be more distant from the problem and the child.  Thus, this book may leave teachers and parents feeling \\"empowered.\\"<br /><br />I was left with one question: In MacKenzie's view, when are youngsters expected to develop personal responsibility to \\"buy into\\" their own self-discipline and not have any problems in school?	2004-11-06

This is Ron Clark's third book (the others also available on Amazon), and the least \\"specific,\\" least detail-oriented of the three.  He states what he believes is necessary for good teaching in eleven short chapters: (1) enthusiasm, (2) adventure, (3) creativity, (4) reflection, (5) balance, (6) compassion, (7) confidence, (8) humor, (9) common sense, (10) appreciation, and (11) resilience.  Clark describes these traits of good teaching and parenting with many entertaining anecdotes.<br /><br />I think that that Ron Clark is a good writer, very gifted teacher, and excellent public speaker.  I thought his book was more entertaining than \\"useful,\\" however, to those in training or already in place in their schools, and that Clark's methods rely on Clark's genius, which is substantial.<br /><br />The book belongs to the genre of (romantic) \\"teacher lit,\\" which emphasizes warm ideas about so-called gifted teachers who can overcome all obstacles to reach all children (somewhat like Jaime Escalante, Jonathon Kozol, Marva Collins, and so forth).  That is why I give the book only three stars, even though I enjoyed it.	2004-11-03

Rozakis has no specific section for studying math, but her emphasis on organization, preparing, rehearsing, and so forth, can be transferred easily.<br /><br />Teachers can use this for a class-wide book in study skills.<br /><br />For older students (late high school and college), you may want to see Study power: Study skills to improve your learning and your grades, by William R. Luckie and Wood Smethurst, which I found to be geared quite well for that age group.<br /><br />Rozakis' book is far better than the one offered by Teacher Created Materials (Middle School Study Skills).  It also is better than Judith Dodge's The Study Skills Handbook (Grades 4-8), and Margaret Nuzum's Study Skills that Stick (with the exception that Nuzum specifically mentions math study skills).<br /><br />I hope this helps.	2004-10-23

Much of the book is direct at the teacher, who is urged to micro-plan his or her classroom experience, e.g., have pencil, pen, and paper, use homework helpers, getting set up for class, having a place to study, and so forth.  Ernst then writes about grading systems (not sure what that has to do with study skills), and then, finally, addresses some specific study skills.  The suggestions in the section \\"Reading This and That\\" seemed fairly elementary to me, and were not, in fact, process skills that students could use.<br /><br />I found Laurie Rozakis' book Super Study Skills to be more useful in this age group.

This book is Ron Clark's story about how he \\"identified\\" the 55 essential skills to get along in life...with the students he was teaching.  He then formulates these \\"rules\\" into his 55 Essential Rules, which he nails to the door of his classrom.<br /><br />Some of the rules make perfect sense (e.g., speaking respectfully) and some even Clark acknowledges are ludicrous (e.g., no \\"orange\\" snack foods in class--which he is willing to remove and throw ostentatiously into the garbage basket).  He seems not to group his skills and rules in any particular fashion, so \\"respect\\" does not preceed \\"caring,\\" for instance.<br /><br />These skills seem very simple: saying please and thank you, \\"ma'am\\" and \\"sir,\\" looking people in the eye, smiling, returning a question for a question, not saying \\"hunh?\\", and so forth.  Clark's accompanying workbook gives parents and teachers some specific methods for teaching these essential 55 skills.<br /><br />The book requires no more than 1 hour reading.  Curriculum implementation, however, is quite a challenge, and Clark underestimates the difficulty and complexity of the challenge.  It is possible to stir up quite a hornet's nest with poor implementation.  If the kids are not ready or prepared, they will experience a lot of what Clark does as a real challenge, and they will either resent the teacher or fight back.  The Workbook (also sold on Amazon) may be helpful.  Clark's book on the 11 essential qualities of a teacher is less helpful than this book.	2004-09-29

I was surprised, since I thought three-D technical drawings were all done on CAD, not by hand.

The Allies, held together by self-interest and the wish to destroy Hitlerism, won for a variety of reasons (production capacity, organizational skill, technical inventiveness), and Overy emphasizes the motivational and moral cause that called each country's peoples together.

This book gives a very clear description of &quot;who knew what, when,&quot; or &quot;who told what, when.&quot;  The authors convey the excitement of trying to develop contacts within Enron and Arthur Andersen, and how they had to protect their sources.  They describe in detail how they broke the story, and how, in 24 days, Enron and Anderson both imploded.  I remember reading the original Wall Street Journal articles and being amazed at how the reporters covered the company, even after the media feeding frenzy began three weeks into the implosion.<br />I agree with other reviewers who say the accounting schemes needed to be explained better.  Basically, one needs to know the relationship between a company's balance sheet and cash flow statement.  With that, the reader can understand how Enron tried to off-load its liabilities (from the balance sheet) and used Special Purpose Entities (such as LJM, LJM2, and the Raptors, which Enron funded) to inflate their income.  The Special Purpose Entities themselves &quot;paid&quot; for the Enron assets with stock that Enron supplied to the Special Purpose Entities (without charging Balance sheet &quot;Equity.&quot;)  Get it?  The house of cards was OK until Enron stock began falling.<br />The story ends in 2003, and there have been a lot of developments since then.  Nevertheless, this is an exciting story.	2004-06-22

I found the abbreviations and terms somewhat daunting (CCD, chrominance, luminance, NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc.) and the technical descriptions also somewhat daunting (ex: how the camera codes Red Green and Blue colors).  Later in the book, the author describes cameras, production and post-production in some detail.  These were all worthwhile subjects.<br />By the end of the book, however, I was sure that I did not want to invest in a digital movie camera set.  For that reason, it was worth the $25.	2004-06-02

Her intellectual foundations seem to be Ted and Nancy Sizer and the Coalition of Essential Schools forum at Brown University--and the urging to ask important questions of youngsters.<br />Simon believes that most modern schools disconnect kids from their important questions and focus wrongly on the \\"trivial\\" non-essential mechanical mass tests at the end of the year.  To this extent, she shares the liberal bias that objectivity and accountability are chimerical.  Simon also differentiates her approach from cognitive developmentalists (Kohlberg, Nodding, Gilligan), character educators (Wynne, Lickona, Ryan, Bennett), and the values clarification crowd (who get caught in moral relativism).<br />Instead, Simon is a \\"pure\\" educator: she believes that all good education, including moral education, has coherence, is honest, allows for critical reflection, raises questions about how humans should act, and explores questions into the unknown.<br />What I liked most from this book:  Simon gives detailed transcripts and stories from the three schools that served as her fieldwork.  These transcripts are about raising moral questions as part of the curriculum: e.g., in literature (War and Peace) or biology class.  I also agree with her pet peeve--that of missed opportunities to discuss moral and existential issues with kids.<br />I found all of the book easy to understand, but I am saddened that this book really falls into the genre of idealistic \\"systemic reform\\" books--that is, those books by  thoughtful writers who are fed up with the limits of American public schools, which educate few children well.  I believe that it would take thousands of Katherine Simons to implement moral discussions in classrooms--but perhaps some individual teachers will read this book and take heart.nderstand, but I am saddened that this book really falls into the genre of idealistic \\"systemic reform\\" books--that is, those books by  thoughtful writers who are fed up with the limits of American public schools, which educate few children well.

It would have simplified my search to identify a non-ideological, non-simplistic writer on moral development in children.  (From Nucci's references, I have now found others).  This is an elegant, thoughtful book.<br />I thought the book was strong throughout, but the parts that stood out were: (1) the clear conceptualization of moral development (e.g., fairness) , as contrasted to the development of conventions (e.g., why we brush our teeth), in children; (2) the clear statement about how culture and information modify moral standards; (3) the role of emotion in morality; and (4) the cognitive development of morality in children.  The literature review was fabulous.<br />I was a bit surprised that Carol Gilligan's &quot;ethic of caring&quot; morality was not mentioned more prominently, since Nucci writes so clearly about the development of fairness and justice.<br />This is a superb book, written on a high intellectual level.  Other writers I have found compelling have been William Damon, Carolyn Saarni, and Elliot Turiel.  (Turiel wrote the foreword to this book.)	2004-05-11

Everyone in the field of child and developmental psychology has praised this book, which is to child psychology as the Standard Edition is to psychoanalysis.  I had a copy of the third edition from my graduate training; this 1999 5th edition advances that earlier work.  Every graduate student dealing with children and adolescents should have this reference volume.<br />I loved the chapters by Carolyn Saarni (&quot;Emotional Development: Action, communication and understanding), whose other works I have read; by Susan Harter (&quot;The development of self-representations&quot;); and by Elliot Turiel (&quot;The development of morality.&quot;)  They are excellent examples of research, theory, and good writing, all at the same time.<br />This recommendation may sound silly, but I'll say it anyway:  This is the best compendium of theory and research on the social, emotional, and personality development of children and adolescents.  If you are a graduate student, this is a necessary volume.

First, let me agree with the other reviewers that this book is well written, better than most.  For that, a 5.  His first chapter on the definition of &quot;intellectual disposition&quot; and &quot;character&quot; is not tedious (thankfully) and is quite well written.  For that, a 5.  In addition, his emphasis on the practical classroom-based implementation of strategies is very engaging.  For that also, a 5.<br />However, Ritchhart's emphasis on process and content of thinking ignores one thing--the outcome.  How is one to know when intellectual character has been achieved?  And, assuming one has intellectual character, does it lead to better scores (gasp!)?  Sorry, friends, outcome does matter.  For this, a 1.<br />So, overall, a 3.  Great in some places, absent in others.  This leaves the book firmly grounded in liberal/process/metacognitive theories of education.  These theories are interesting to read but (1) difficult to implement (and, by the way, require intellectually oriented teachers), and (2) are absent demonstrated outcome.	2004-03-23

The question then is, &quot;How did this happen?&quot;  The answers are sometimes complex, but one central feature under each person's control is whether he or she can claim some amount of responsibility for their thinking, feeling, and behaving.<br />Self-responsibility and accountability are the heart of Branden's self-help book, especially the notion that each person is accountable for choices, decisions, actions, beliefs, values, management of time, choice of companions, and one's own happiness.  At some level, this self-help book is a refreshing reality-based tonic.<br />Branden also talks about self-responsibility in organizations, which I found helpful.  Less helpful, however, is his  condemnation of welfare, because he does not take into account the lack of responsibility in the people who made the welfare system so &quot;good.&quot;  Also, he does not take into account the realistic difficulties that people in poverty have, nor the success stories of families who have emerged from poverty.  In this sense, he presages O'Reilly.  He would have been more consistent by talking about the destruction of responsibility by drugs and alcohol.<br />This is a short read.

Nel Noddings has written a very persuasive book from a feminist perspective about how to bring children into the feelings, concerns, and behaviors of moral people.  Her writing is lucid, frank, somewhat elevated, and not the usual stuff of educational theory.  This is a thoroughly academic book.<br />Noddings proposes an ethic of care as the basis upon which all moral education should take place.  Central to this ethic of care is open-ended dialogue (What are you going through?), and discussion of a topic (i.e., not simply a conversation).  In giving someone our attention, we care for them and promote an ethical discussion.<br />She believes strongly that we live in a climate of violence, such that many children do not feel cared for and have no continuity in their care, so caring for these children and adolescents is itself part of the youngsters moral development (i.e., learning how to receive care).<br />She also believes that the structure of secondary education (organized around subject matter, not around students or their questions) militates against providing a moral education.<br />Her writing has a pessimistic tinge to it, in that she believes that coercion of students into particular subjects (against their will, in math, for example) is counter-to-moral caring.  This coercion puts Noddings firmly into the progressive-liberal post-modern feminist educational camp, and opposed to any sort of back-to-basics, learn-the-fundamentals education.<br />Despite her liberal slant, she has many good points, e.g., Children today need desperately to know how to care for themselves and for intimate others.Instead of tackling the subject of human life and love holistically, schools respond to various crises with drug education, sex education, and violence prevention courses (p. 33).  Uniquely among modern educators and many politicians, Noddings writes that education cannot be the route out of poverty for everyone [because] poverty is a social problem, not an educational one (p. 94)-which is a very refreshing take on the moral basis of American educational policy, and which conventional persons might think to be elitist (in the sense that the popular myth of education is that it is the one fair route out of poverty).  Her main goal of education is to raise competent, caring, loving, and lovable people (p. 99)<br />Other than her clarion call for moral education in schools, I am not sure that I liked this book, partly because Noddings dismisses so much of existing moral and character education as being fruitless, coercive, or capable of being coercive.  Readers who wish to have specific directions on how to implement a caring classroom will be disappointed because there are very few practicalities addressed in this largely theoretical book, other than the notion of using a modern caring feminist perspective in moral education.  Yet, like good moral questions, in reading this book you have to think about the topic, and Noddings does bring us to consider what we mean by moral and character education.because] poverty is a social problem, not an educational one (p. 94)-which is a very refreshing take on the moral basis of American educational policy, and which conventional persons might think to be elitist (in the sense that the popular myth of education is that it is the one fair route out of poverty).

This book reviews basic theory and applications of classroom management, emphasizing respect for the teacher and student, arriving at solutions to disruptive behavior jointly under the teacher's direction.  It serves as a good supplementary book in basic teacher education classes or to Froyen &amp; Iverson's Schoolwide and Classroom Management.  The embedded educational theory is positivistic rationalism (that all disruptive students can be brought to classroom peace through basically rational interventions and natural/logical consequences).  The book does not cover issues such as power struggles, except to imply that teachers should avoid them through the recommended techniques.  Nor does it cover school-wide discipline, antisocial student behavior, or poorly motivated students.  Therefore, there are some blind spots in this book.<br />Nevertheless, the authors thoroughly and practically describe what good classroom management is for the main body of youngsters in school.	2004-03-13

This book exemplifies the post-modern trend in psychological thinking, i.e., (i) There are no universally valid \\"givens,\\" other than this one; (ii) Truth depends on perspective and context; and (iii) Validity stems from a proposition's meaning, and so forth.<br />Langer happens to be one of the more articulate proponents of this kind of thinking, namely: (i) conditional teaching and (ii) creative distractions increase the \\"mindfulness\\" of a person's learning; that (iii) rote learning is verboten, (iv) that one should help youngsters move toward \\"mindfulness,\\" and (v) that \\"flexibility\\" in thinking, not raw intellect, is favored as an indicator of intellect.<br />Some of her techniques can be useful to educators and teachers: (i) conditional questions and presentations, (ii) mindful scanning, (iii) reading from more than one perspective, (iv) searching for differences, (v) shifting questions from \\"obvious\\" to \\"not so obvious,\\" and so on.<br />Despite the post-modern flavor, the embedded educational philosophy here is Progressive and Romantic, not Basics, so if you want something that will tell you how good it is to memorize the multiplication tables, this book is not it.  While I have do doubt that Prof. Langer is a very creative and unique person, the unstated educational philosophy here is as elite and as unfulfilling as a Bordeaux cookie.	2004-03-11

This 1992 book is the \\"grandfather\\" of all the books in character education.  Lickona compiles his experience in moral and ethical education, along with many, many examples from classrooms and schools.  Thus, this is an especially teacher-friendly book.<br />The theory is not expressed as clearly as it is in Ryan and Bohlin's Building Character in Schools, but Lickona's work is far more practical.  A teacher or parent will get more from this book.  I really loved his section on nine kinds of cooperative learning.  In a way, his book is a combination of useful techniques in classroom-based moral philosophy and core moral knowledge applied to real-life youngsters who need the teacher's (and parents') perspectives to arrive at moral soundness.<br />Lickona thinks it is necessary to infuse moral training into all that the school does.  He is flexible enough, however, to note that not all schools and not all faculty can support an infusion model.  As a result, he is very practical about what individual teachers in their classrooms can do.  This is a primary strength of the book.<br />I hope you enjoy this book.	2004-03-03

This book discusses the shift in American education from &quot;values-neutral&quot; and &quot;strictly content&quot; education toward a different and necessary ideal: educating youngsters to live a &quot;good life.&quot;  (This is the goal that movie watchers saw in the final scene of &quot;Saving Pvt. Ryan,&quot; where the older Ryan asks his wife and children, &quot;Did I lead a good life?&quot;)  Both authors are from the Center for the Advancement of Ethics and Character at Boston University.  They write primarily for educators and have teachers in mind.  They promote the idea that education is in &quot;its fullest sense is inescapably a moral enterprise&quot; (p. 190).<br />I found the book to be well writeen and filled with many good examples.  I particularly liked the Appendices (76 pages), filled with good advice.  Ryan and Bohlin also discuss how character education is different from &quot;values clarification&quot; and &quot;teaching a viewpoint.&quot;  In character education, students discover the importance of (or lack of) virtues; that there are multiple answers to moral questions; that characters in literature and history &quot;grow into&quot; their moral positions, and that character education wishes to inculcate the importance of &quot;knowing good, seeing good, and doing good.&quot;<br />This is the coming age in U.S. education.  This book along with some others (William Damon, The Moral Child; Bringing in a New Era in Character Education; Thomas Lickona, Educating for Character) will provide a good theoretical background.  Ryan and Bohlin warn us away from pre-packaged character education activities, and, as a result, I am not quite sure where to go from here (which is why I took off one star).<br />I hope you enjoy the book.	2004-03-02

I think this edited book is one of William Damon's best, because he brings together nine writers who each take a position on the prospects and future of character education in American schools and universities.  The essays are very well written and integrated,  and are accessible to upper high school and college-level readers.<br />Damon's position is that character education has been neglected because of &quot;false oppositions&quot; (either-or propositions), such as &quot;individual vs. the community,&quot; &quot;secular vs. the religious,&quot; and so on.  These oppositions are false because each &quot;side&quot; of the argument stems from adult perspectives, not the ideas and imaginations of developing children.  Additionally, advocates for each &quot;side&quot; fail to use the logic of &quot;both-and&quot; propositions.<br />As Damon says, &quot;I have never heard of a youngster being harmed by witnessing another person's expression of spirituality, even when the form of spirituality is highly unfamiliar to the child.  On the contrary, young persons are usually moved and fascinated...&quot; (p. xiii-xiv).  This is an example of how he wishes to understand the development of children and adolescents in areas of moral and character development.<br />The essays concern (1) how to transmit moral values when the transcendant American value is the &quot;autonomous self;&quot; (2) how character education is based on valid, scientific developmental psychology; (3) how to educate youngsters by &quot;moral exemplarity&quot; and by building a democratic community; and (4) how most Americans really are very united on the values that underpin character education.<br />I hope you enjoy this book.	2004-02-25

In this book he addresses in conversational language how American kids came to be the least empathic, least knowledgeable, and most indulged and self-indulged children in the world.  Obviously, this outcome is not entirely the fault of the kids themselves: the faults are multiple.  Nevertheless, this cultural battle has, at its stake, &quot;the lives...and hopes of our young&quot; (p. xii).<br />Damon documents the singular effects of under-privilege and over-privilege on youngsters, such that youngsters now lack wholesome ambition and are fundamentally demoralized.  He tries very hard to not sound like a Cassandra, but the statistics and examples are those that we read in our ordinary daily papers, so it seems reasonable to agree with him that youngsters in this country are in significant trouble.<br />Dr. Damon then offers a middle-of-the-road perspective on correcting these problems.  He clearly dislikes the fact that politicians take &quot;sound bite&quot; positions on this cultural war and use mistakes and myths to polarize the public.<br />He speaks clearly about &quot;respectful engagement&quot; with youngsters, expecting something back from them, not treating children as little ceramic vessels that will break at the first challenge in life, the benefits of discipline in terms of self-social-and-moral growth, and how schools, teachers, parents, community workers, and the youngsters themselves can recover the true spirit of youth--&quot;a transcendant sense of purpose linked to community and spirituality [morality].&quot;<br />I always like Damon's books.  He is reasonable and clear. He has a great passion for youngsters.  He believes that it is not too much to expect that all youngsters should be able to be honest, decent, respectful, fair, and responsible.<br />I hope you enjoy this book.	2004-02-24

The book is organized into activities that build (1) teamwork, (2) self-esteem, (3) communication, (4) self-discovery, (5) anger management, and (6) coping skills.  Almost all activities are designed for elementary school aged children, but Ms. Jones, under each activity, presents variations--either in the activity itself or in the intended age group.<br />The crucial part of using these activities occurs after the activity is done.  This is the &quot;debriefing&quot; part of the activity.  It is absolutely necessary to do this debriefing in order that the youngster(s) arrive at some understanding of the activity just completed, and its possible meaning to them.  It is assumed that the reader is comfortable with this type of debriefing, and has the skills to intercede in case the activity or debriefing are going south.<br />The things I liked about this book are: (1) Ms. Jones' energy and positive thinking about youngsters and her desire to provide them with challenging and thoughtful moments; (2) She explains each activity or game fully, provides lists of materials needed, gives some advice on structuring the activity; (3) This is therapy &quot;in action,&quot; so it attracts the interest and energy of the youngsters.<br />I had two small questions about some of this book: (1) Self-esteem comes from accomplishing something, and I thought self-esteem activities were the weakest section of the book; and (2) In regard to anger management, these activities must be regarded as an adjunct, not the central core, of an anger management therapy program.  When readers have a good therapeutic anger management therapy program at their facility (in their classroom), Ms. Jones' activities can help.<br />I was impressed by Ms. Jones' selection and believe it will help counselors, therapists, coaches, and recreational therapists.<br />I was impressed by Ms. Jones' selection and believe it will help counselors, therapists, coaches, and recreational therapists.	2004-02-24

William Damon has written a number of excellent scientific articles and books on social and self-development of children.  In this book, designed for a lay audience of parents and teachers, Damon outlines the moral development of children, all of which takes place in the social crucible of family, childhood and adolescent friends, and school.  He is a long way from being a naive moralist, however.  Instead, Damon focuses on the factors that encourage moral development (what he calls \\"responsive engagement\\" with children) and those that discourage it (authoritarianism, permissive parenting, disconnected parenting, self-centered, etc.).<br />His reasoning is quite clear.  I liked best his summary section (p. 117-119) on how moral development occurs in childhood, and I think it is the best summary for lay persons that I have ever encountered.  Another strength of the book is that Damon clearly contrasts competing theories well (for example, theories of \\"best parenting practices\\").  His summary of how to foster children's emotional and moral growth (Chapter 7) is quite good.<br />Damon's knowledge of the psychological/social literature is very broad.  This book is well-referenced.  Nevertheless, academic readers may be discontended, because this book is aimed at parents, teachers, and other lay adults.  Like many readers, the academic readers will look forward to reading Damon's other books.	2004-02-17

This book was not quite what I expected.  Silly me, I had expected something about how protocols would lead directly to school or academic improvement.  Instead, this is a book about how to run reflective teachers' meetings in schools.  The book presents about four dozen &quot;starting points&quot; for teacher in-service trainers, and ways to &quot;run&quot; the conversation(s).  It really was not bad, but I had a hard time seeing why the authors used the word &quot;power&quot; in the title.<br />I suppose this sort of thinking has some place in American education.

Shaffer, a professor at University of Georgia, has put his heart into this book on social and personality development.  Besides the production problems noted by other reviewers (no colors, repetition, and expense), this book has conceptual and organizational problems.<br />(1) Shaffer does not summarize human longitudinal studies, which illustrate some of the most difficult problems and long-standing findings in child development.<br />(2) It would have been easy for him to summarize prevalence rates, age-of-onset, or effect sizes of various developmental sequences, problems, or interventions in social and cognitive development.<br />(3) Shaffer overemphasizes the results of multicultural interventions (because they are trendy and \\"easy\\" to support?).<br />(4) Only chapters 4 through 6 deal with development.  The other chapters are about topical issues in development: need for achievement (but without countervailing emphasis from \\"newer\\" researchers); sex differences; aggression and antisocial conduct (what a great place to put studies of non-physical aggression like teasing and fashion-police in schools!); altruism and moral development; the family (but NOT from a developmental point of view [that is, the family develops and changes along with the child] or from an interactional point of view); and \\"extrafamilial influences\\" such as TV, computers, and peers.<br />(5) Shaffer stumbles on his assessment of schools, which have both poor achievement records and are sites of covert and overt student aggression.<br />Finally, (6) for Shaffer, personality and social development stop at the end of adolescence.  There is very little on the concept of identity consolidation and life beyond 18 years old.<br />The result is a book with a flawed design, and it is not really from a human development perspective, other than the three chapters I noted above.  It is workman-like and well-referenced, and the writing is satisfactory (but quite wordy), so it does not earn more than 3 stars.  Too bad!  Human development is a fascinating, live, palpitating subject, and is well worth studying.  I don't think this text will help college students appreciate the light and joy of children, adolescents, families, and the knowledge that has accumulated much over the past 100 years.<br />Because of these problems, I found this book hard to read.

Trained as an historian, Ravitch writes beautifully.  She sees the conflicts that have troubled American public education, the advocates for the various sides, and the results of conflicts with an historian's clear-eyed sense of proportion, cause-and-effect, and the consequences of certain policies.<br />The history begins in post WW II America, when the bomber plants were closing, America was further urbanizing and suburbanizing, and, having won the war, what else was there to do?  She describes the following decades clearly--the loyalty investigations, how Brown v Board of Education in Topeka stressed the then-intact system of discriminatory education, the rise of \\"social science\\" in education, the Vietnam War era of protest, drugs, reformers, radicals, and romantics.  Her history ends in 1985, with the \\"new politics:\\"  the rise of aggrieved groups, use of courts to make basic educational policy decisions, the return to ethnocentrism, bureaucratization, and fierce politicalization of the unions.<br />Diane Ravitch writes beautifully.  I know of no comparable history in American education.  She has taken a quantum leap from other historians' writings in education.  I loved this fluent and clear-eyed book.  In 1983 the Pulitzer History prize was won by a book called The Transformation of Virginia.  Ravitch's book is at a Pulitzer level.	2004-01-24

This is too bad, because it is a powerful scolding the the laissez-faire, \\"modern,\\" \\"child-centered,\\" \\"feminist you-can-have-it-all,\\" day-care and sex-education society that has little moral wisdom to pass to its children.  Her observations on how \\"experts\\" have caved into what she calls the \\"Americal Pastorale Child\\" motif are apt, and acidic.  Her fundamental axiom is this: that all (good) child development depends on a transmitted morality based on self-denial and self-discipline.  The only way to achieve these is not to depend on the \\"inherent\\" capacity of children to develop these, but, instead, on powerful, care-giving, available adult(s) who decline to take shortcuts, and who take moral stands in their lives.<br />I loved a number of sections of this book.  Hymowitz dissects Sesame Street elegantly as a public TV enterprise that teaches kids to watch TV, not learn literacy.  She points out that it is a paradox to teach children and adolescents to be free and also to have self-restraint.  She takes exception to the \\"expert\\" view that children and adolescents \\"naturally\\" develop empathy: \\"And why are well-nurtured teenagers so lacking this natural feeling when it comes to the suffering that their flagrant rudeness causes their parents?\\" (p. 61).<br />Great book, a little hard to read casually, but her message is not a casual one.  After you finish it, however, you may wonder, \\"Well, what do I do now?\\"	2004-01-22

Each has assembled existing data and impressions, and has answered questions such as, \\"What is it like to teach amid the torrent of popular culture?\\" and \\"How can one socialize children in a culture of obscenity?\\"  \\"How much exposure to violence, sex, drugs, and alcohol constitutes a problem?\\"  \\"What are the lasting effects of controversial music?\\"<br />I am a great fan of Diane Ravitch and Joseph Viteritti, based on their previous books, and their edited books.  This one is my favorite.<br />The writers are fluent with their data, so the academic part is easy to read.  More important, however, is that the writers describe \\"what it is like\\" (the \\"phenomenology\\" in academic language) to swim in this sea of obscene popular culture.  This makes me think that they have touched the lives of children, and have examined their own experiences in our culture.  Finally, even though their findings are largely that the culture has changed for the worse, they are not hysterical.  Their recommendations reflect an appropriate course (or set of courses) to take, for lawmakers, educators, parents, guardians, and, yes, even the purveyors of this media blitz of violence and sex.  Since nobody has their hands clean, it is good to read these writers.<br />One part I loved was the author who asked makers of pornography whether they would want their children exposed to it.  Their answers reflect a moral compartmentalization, because they make their living from what is so popular and desensitizing, and yet are very ambivalent about having their children see pornography--it is the way the world \\"is,\\" but not the way they might like their children \\"see\\" it.<br />Great book.

William Damon wrote this book 20 years ago, when he was at Clark University.  It is a comprehensive and well-written account of social and personality development: individuality, the origins of self in infancy, childhood; peer relations and the development of prosocial behavior; adult-child relations; adolescent social relations; and consolidation of adolescent identity.  He is a thoroughly academic writer, comprehensive and fluent in various theories of child development as well as the experimental and observational literature that supports or examines the theories and his commentary.<br />The only drawback is that this is a dated review, published twenty years ago.  A lot has happened in terms of infant-parent and child-parent interaction, degradation of the culture (TV, etc.), and children's personality.  Nevertheless, this is a good start, and worth the read...<br />Damon is now at Standford University/Hoover Institution, which seems very well deserved, given how fluent this book is (and so early in his career).  Other books by Damon on Amazon.com promise good reading, also, including Greater Expectations: Overcoming the Culture of Indulgence (1995), and The Moral Child (1990).	2003-12-25

This curriculum workbook springs from Goldstein's and Brooks' book, Raising Resilient Children, which (for some reason I do not know) is no longer available through Amazon.com (you would have to buy it used).  (Perhaps the authors are planning a second edition?)<br />This is a 9-week course covering: (1) Teaching and conveying empathy; (2) re-writing negative scripts; (3) Discplining in ways that promote self-discipline and growth; (4) Making decisions, solving problems; (5) loving children in ways that help them feel special and appreciated; (6) learning from mistakes; (7) Expecting success, \\"islands of competence\\"; (8) hope and courage.<br />It is accompanied by a video tape (not available from Amazon.com) but which would be good for persons planning parent groups or in-service for teachers.<br />The age-group that the authors write about is children, but with some modifications (especially with discipline) it could be applied to adolescents.<br />This book is an easy beginning to the practical aspects of resilience education.  It is graphically good looking and substantively good.	2003-06-25

The authors' contention is that resilience and \\"protective\\" factors create successes in all kids, but especially those \\"at risk.\\"  They see resilience as a \\"self-righting mechanism\\" that allows students to withstand the winds that blow around them.<br />They then propose four main areas to teach resilience: decision-making skills, explicitly connecting thoughts to feelings to action, building on interests and strengths, and a \\"healthy democratic community\\" that is centered on caring.  Up to this point, all of this seems pretty reasonable.<br />Unfortunately, the authors do not connect explicitly these four areas with their PORT-able method.  A teacher who wished to teach resilience to her kids would not know where to start, what exercises would help, or whether there are some things in school better left unsaid.<br />The second half of the book reminds me of re-warmed progressive educational methods, reframed for a post-therapeutic culture.  Conservative readers will have a hard time understanding just how educational attainment is connected to the resilience education (besides, the methods are unclear or left out completely).  In addition, the proposed \\"advantages\\" of resilience education are not linked with any data whatsoever about educational attainment from other studies (The authors often cite the work of British child psychiatrist Michael Rutter's 1985 work on resilience, but he did not connect resilience to educational attainment).  The last chapter also uses terms like \\"meta-reflection\\" and then thanks the reader for reading.  Really! So I found the theory OK, the methods absent, and the tone of the book, at the end, cloying.	2003-06-21

Resilience is defined as \\"the ability of a child to deal more effectively with stress and pressure, to cope with everyday challenges, to bounce back from disappointments, adversity, and trauma, to set clear and realistic goals, to solve problems, to relate comfortably with others, and to treat oneself and others with respect\\" (p. 1)<br />These ten principles are \\"idealized\\" child \\"mindsets,\\" which parental behavior supports.  The authors do not criticize parents for not supporting their children all the time.  Instead, they give numerous suggestions and examples of what a parent can do to improve their communication with their children.<br />The tone of this book is \\"talky\\" and easy to read.  Perhaps 2/3rds of the examples are about children; the rest, adolescents.  Almost all examples come from the authors' extensive psychotherapy and family therapy practices.<br />I have some quibbles with the logic of some of their conclusions, but, in general, parents will find this an easy and helpful read.  Although the topic of \\"resilience\\" is a part of the newly emerging field of \\"social-emotional learning\\" (SEL), educators will find this book harder to use.  The children in the examples attend schools, but there is no description of how to implement a resilience curriculum.<br />The authors also publish a workbook, \\"Raising resilient children: A curriculum to foster strength, hope, and optimism in children.\\"  This workbook is tied to a video that the authors have produced (but which is not sold with the workbook; the video must be ordered from the publisher and I have not seen it on Amazon.com).  This workbook provides exercises with which they can build the competence to support their children.  This workbook also gives the gist of their argument, and teaches parents directly how to implement the skills to support their child.	2003-06-18

McClain has fashioned a highly detailed, sophisticated, and complex history of Japan from 1603 to the present.  The historiography is superb (he obviously is totally bilingual and is fluent in Japanese sources).  The history is both descriptive (chronological, social, political, economic, family/personal) as well as analytic (how social structure affected the rise of industrial society, for example).  The overall effect is to make Japanese history clear and comprehensible.  The people of Japan stand out in distinct relief.<br />I was puzzled that the Boston Globe reviewer was much cooler toward this book than I think most readers are or will be.

I received a copy of the 10th printing of the first edition, copyrighted in 1995.  If you are using Mathematica 3 or 4.+, this book is out of date.<br />Also, you cannot use this book without understanding linear algebra; that is, you must be taking Lin Alg concurrently.  So it is not useful for self-improvement, or fun.  If you know Linear Algebra or Mathematica already, this book will not help you.<br />There are some major problems in the examples.  For instance, Johnson writes about For loops in Mathematica, but one example simply produced a runaway calculation (p. 29).  Also, (p.37) the Mathematica &quot;manual&quot; row reduction example needs a special warning: if you make an error, you cannot simply go back and correct it by overwriting; you have to return to the beginning.  Else, your results with have compound errors embedded.<br />Problems like these float elsewhere in the book. Too bad.<br />For students beginning Linear Algebra, a better book (and one we hope gets revised soon) is C-K Cheung et al., Getting Started With Mathematica.<br />I am sorry that Brooks/Cole and the Wolfram website still market Johnson's out-of-date and error-prone book.  If Johnson revises the book, hopefully incorporating Mathematica 4.2, I hope these errors get corrected.  At that time I hope I can change this review to a 5*.	2003-01-24

Righteous Victims is a \\"revisionist\\" history of the Zionist-Arab conflict, so its conclusions spark terrific controversy (as you can see from the other reviews on Amazon.com!)  I found this book very informative, balanced, and nuanced--a very well written analytic and descriptive history.  As the NY Times reviewer said, the book's tone is \\"calm.\\"<br /><br />Morris had access to more Jewish and Israeli sources than Arab-Palestinian-Muslim sources, so of course critics can claim that the conclusions are \\"biased\\" in some ways.  Nevertheless, at each turn in the narrative, Morris clearly describes the political, social, economic, demographic, ideological, intellectual, national, and military consequences of each \\"phase\\" or \\"stage\\" in the conflict, from \\"both\\" sides.  (The conflict is far more complicated than \\"two\\" sides, however.)<br /><br />No matter how one regards his conclusions, Morris's dual empathy--for a people nearly crushed under (centuries of European) anti-Semitism and Hitler, and for a dispossessed, poorly led, and impoverished people--comes clear.  The book is 784 pages (counting the index) so there is ample opportunity to find something to disagree with, but the thrust and conclusions are hard to escape: security eludes Israel, which has never felt safe; and the Palestinians are citizens of nothing outside the refugee camps.<br /><br />At some level, this book sadly reminded me of Yeats' poem, written in WW I, \\"Slouching toward Bethlehem.\\"  What new beast, in this terrible time for both Israelis and Arabs, is waiting to be born?	2003-01-13

The authors have used all of their journalist talents and sources to compile this excellent history of the war between Israel, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan. They use extensive public and private sources, archives, biographies, news conference transcripts, interviews, documents, and radio and television announcements and commentaries. They also include U.S. and Soviet sources.<br />A tapestry of many threads, this book weaves several complex themes together: Israeli hubris, Egyptian planning and diplomacy, the failure of intelligence agencies, the impact of the conflict on all of the countries, diplomatic constraints on all the involved parties, how \\"client\\" states used the superpower conflict, and how Israel barely survived the attack. The authors also include personal commentaries from \\"ordinary\\" people in both countries. The authors' research is so extensive that they easily point to \\"holes\\" or \\"fractures\\" in the thinking of the national and international leaders, as the conflict developed.<br />In addition, the writing is excellent, as only the Brits can do it. You will be entranced with their scope.<br />Another book you might find interesting is Two O'Clock War (also on Amazon.com), which details the U.S. airlift of crucial supplies during the war.	2002-10-16

He comes with Harvard's panache, having been a member of its faculty.  He hopes to build school faculties of leaders who can transform a school from &quot;ordinary&quot; to &quot;super,&quot; with close attention to the hearts of the kids and teachers.<br />This book ignores one of the major findings from Diane Ravitch's Left Behind, however.  She says, &quot;What American education most needs is not more nostrums and enthusiasms but more attention to fundamental, time-tested truths&quot; (p. 453).  Barth's thinking that teachers can somehow be leaders in a bureaucratized, systemically crippled system qualifies as a nostrum.  Barth celebrates &quot;craft knowledge&quot; (as opposed to what he calls &quot;booklernin'&quot;) He proposes, without evidence, that teachers who use these methods will have learning go &quot;off the chart&quot; (p. 11).  I could not find any reference at all to basic education, mathematical facts, reading good literature, or how to set standards for what he proposes.<br />Too bad.  A fairly well written book, Learning by Heart is loaded with unvalidated ideas, romantic hyperbole, and nostrums.  It may work for Harvard types, but not for most of the country.	2002-09-03

Michael Oren offers multiple perspectives on the context of the June, 1967 war between Israel and the Arab countries.  He uses Israeli, Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, US and Soviet sources.  He interviewed dozens of people to create this narrative.  He has an excellent feel for &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; narratives, so he also quotes extensively from diaries of the major protagonists.<br />In formal terms, this is a &quot;revisionist&quot; narrative, in that he acknowledges that Israel made the first strike in this war (for many years, it was hard to establish this position).  He outlines carefully the pressures on both the Israeli and Arab side, both internally and &quot;public&quot; or nationalistic pressures, and documents diplomatic pressures to avoid the war or to bring the war to a close, in that it was encapsulated inside the US-Soviet conflict.<br />Six Days carries military, political, diplomatic, and personal stories.

She writes with wit and compassion about girls' teen years and their need for relationships to help steady down the turmoil in family and the developing self.  While she cites various authorities on teen years, she has developed her own compassionate authority from her experiences.  She is, in a sense, a &quot;natural&quot; therapist, one of those genuinely helpful persons who has great empathy for teens.<br />It is not so much a &quot;survival guide&quot; as an affirmation of how important relationships are, especially when they change during a girl's maturation.  Roberts is clear about the importance of fathers in this affirmation.  In a divorce situation, she astutely observes that girls often reserve their anger and confusion for their moms and hold back on their (more distant) dads.  Her recommendations make good sense--talking things through, affirmation, being clear about limits, asking about the girl's feelings.<br />I think men will get a lot from this book, also.  We know that when fathers pull back from daughters in their teen years, many girls end up hurt/confused/wounded/angry, so it is important to maintain an appropriate relationship with your daughter.  Roberts is on the right track.	2002-08-31

She grounds the book in developmental psychology, and listens very carefully to children as they state or &quot;explain&quot; how they think and feel.  Her theory is largely constructionist, but also is framed by neo-Piagetian theory.<br />She outlines the development of 8 skills that make up for and &quot;create&quot; emotional competence: (1) Awareness of one's own emotions, (2) Ability to discern and understand others' emotions, (3) ability to use the vocabulary of emotion and expression, (4) capacity for empathic involvement, (5) ability to differentiate internal experience from external expression, (6) capacity for coping with aversive emotions and distressing circumstances, (7) awareness of emotional communication in relationships, and (8) capacity for emotional self-efficacy.<br />While this is a lot (!) and her writing is very precise, I loved her descriptions of children and their thinking and feeling.  I left this book with a sense of someone who genuinely cares for children and their development.  She listens very carefully.<br />I think clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and school psychologists or guidance counselors will get a lot from this book, but there is nothing &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;applied&quot; in her descriptions of children.  This is a book on normal social and emotional development, not intervention.  Nevertheless, much of the recent interest in social emotional learning must rest on the concepts she presents, so the book's usefulness is apparent.	2002-08-29

Teachers interested in Social emotional learning (SEL) will benefit from this book.  This book promotes use of the Sharing Circle as the primary vehicle for building social emotional learning in the classroom, and all 50 activities are geared to this method.  As such, it reminds one of Ruth Charney's work with the Northeast Foundation for Children.<br />As much as I liked the practical aspects of this book--how to set up Sharing Circles, problems that one might encounter, for example--the book does not speak about &quot;infusing&quot; SEL into a school.  These activities are an &quot;add-on,&quot; therefore.  Individual teachers will get a number of good activities to do with kids.  The second problem is that Ms. Schilling does not offer a framework from which to evaluate SEL growth in kids.  Usually SEL programs promote cognitive-behavioral adjustment, but there are no proposed outcome criteria here.<br />So, in all, not a bad start, and just what it advertises: activities, not theory or outcome.<br />This book mimics Schillings two other books: Level II: Middle School and Level III: High School.  These two other books use exactly the same structure and outline.  About half of the activities in this book overlap Level II; about half of Level II overlap Level III.	2002-08-29

Doty develops activities in 5 areas: (1) awareness of self and others, (2) approval of self and others, (3) responsibility, (4) personal meanings, and (5) honesty and ethics.  She also has brief sections on creating thematic units (an infusion strategy for SEL or EI), and evaluation rubrics for these 5 areas.  As such, this is an OK introduction for teachers who need some basic introduction and suggestion for activities.  She develops positive discipline with natural consequences, but her work is more teacher-centered than other natural consequences advocates such as Northeast Foundation for Children (e.g., Ruth Charney).<br />I found her book better integrated than Dianne Schilling's three SEL/EI activities books.<br />Four other points:  While these are passably good activities, many of them are \\"teacher suggested\\" rather than coming from some idea or problem that students voice.  While she does use circle discussions, many of the activities are \\"teacher led\\" and can be typical didactic lessons.  While some of the activities are on target, some are self-esteem bromides.  Finally, while some activities are developmentally appropriate, they are not linked to developmental milestones, so they are \\"generic\\" K-8 activities.<br />This book will be useful to teachers who would like suggestions about where to begin.	2002-08-29

On the positive side, this book is a checklist of fairly obvious parenting issues with boys.  It also offers a long list of bromides.  Examples from the 200 recommendations in this list are: Be yourself [as a parent, I suppose];  Don't tease [mixed messages are hard to decode].  Some recommendations are better than others, e.g., Stop the glorification of violence.  Some of the \\"quotes\\" from men look so canned that they seem to have been made up.<br />On the negative side, this book addresses only peripherally emotional intelligence, which is something it said it would help you raise.  For instance, the authors say very little about boys regulating and coping with emotions, their expressive behavior, or relationship building.  In addition, the authors say nothing about ethical values which are meant to be part of emotional intelligence.  After all, con men have emotional intelligence: they read their mark carefully.  The difference is that their behavior is divorced from ethics.<br />Too bad.<br />This is a companion book from the same publisher about girls' self-esteem.  Parents might find that book relatively more helpful.	2002-08-28

The good parts of this book:  the recommendations are practical, reasonable, and, in the long run, pretty straight-forward.  Some examples of the 200 items:  Get your priorities straight; Teach her to set healthy boundaries.  In all, not a bad checklist.<br />This book probably is useful to parents or caregivers who need to review or talk about these items.  For parents or caregivers to a child with moderate academic, social, or emotional problems, however, this book is insufficient.  Readers should turn to books by Myrna Shure, Martin Seligman, and others.<br />This book matches a similar book for boys, from the same publisher, 200 Ways to Raise a Boy's Emotional Intelligence.

The stories are enchanting, and the information interesting.  This is not a &quot;how to&quot; book, however.  Instead, it is a general overview with many particular examples and explanations.  The author's recommendations are straightforward and affirming, to fathers, mothers, and sons.  He cares for and accepts the foibles and modes of boyhood.  Biddulph has a whole chapter on the effects of testosterone, and I thought that was a little overdone, since our humaneness, as he notes many times later in the book, is not biologically determined.	2002-08-26

Myrna Shure tells parents and teachers (from a cognitive-behavioral point of view) how to help 8- to 12-year-olds cope with ordinary and not-so-ordinary pressures of growing up.  Her method is central to establishing a positive social emotional learning climate in a classroom.  She also helps parents avoid the traps that parents fall into: power struggles, &quot;telling&quot; (i.e., ordering), &quot;explaining,&quot; and so forth.  Her belief is that if children in this group can &quot;think&quot; better about emotional issues, then they will handle the pressures of adolescence much better.  Therefore, while her work addresses immediate issues of growing up in 8 to 12 year-olds, she also thinks &quot;preventatively&quot; about the 13 to 18 year-old group.<br />Shure proposes teaching youngsters five fundamental skills: (1) understanding another's feelings and point of view; (2) understanding motives; (3) finding alternate solutions; (4) considering consequences; and (5) planning sequential steps to arrive at one's goals.  Her emphasis is on the child's intrinsic motivation to do better and be part of a group, not on extrinsic rewards (as in &quot;ordinary&quot; behavior therapy).<br />She has great empathy and flexibility with kids.  You will see in this book a perceptive, creative, and sensitive grown-up working with kids and parents.  You will learn how to develop and apply these five skills with children--either in your home or in your classroom.  The I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) program is worth the ticket of admission, but to get a chance to &quot;hear&quot; her good heart is a double bonus.<br />I also liked her time-frame.  Children need time to grow.  She is not an instant-fix-it expert.  She respects kids enough to value their own pace, for themselves.	2002-08-26

Kathy Greeley narrates her year-long journey with a group of \\"typical\\" eighth graders in Cambridge, MA.  This group had a six-year span in reading levels (and presumably math, too, but her job was Engligh/history/language arts).  Coming with the \\"social-emotional learning\\" focus and Coalition of Essential Schools tenents, she crafted a marvelous experience for these kids--one well worth reading.<br />She shows what a very bright, dedicated, and resourceful teacher can do.<br />She clearly is above-the-norm.<br />It appears that her classroom was pre-MCAS, which is the standardized testing that takes place throughout Massachusetts at the end of the eighth grade.  Therefore, her evidence of growth is limited to her description, which is moving and compelling.  The biggest gap in the social-emotional learning \\"camp,\\" however, is the lack of documentation of superior growth on standardized measures.  This reflects the fractious divide in American education, unfortunately, between the \\"conservative\\" back-to-basics and Let's-test-'em crowd and the more \\"liberal\\" multiple-intelligences and learn-better-when-you-work-well-together group.  Could we not ask the conservatives and liberals to show multiple outcomes to the good work they both do?  Greeley cannot be faulted for this problem, obviously, and her work deserves serious thought.<br />It appears from the back of the book that Ms. Greeley is still teaching.  Good for her!

This is a companion to Cohen's other edited book, Caring Classrooms/Intelligent Schools.  This book addresses an older group of youngsters in school--those passing into adolescence.  The 12 chapters cover the theory of social emotional learning (SEL) in schools.  A number of SEL curricula or projects are discussed, such as the Comer/New Haven project, the work from the Northeast Foundation for Children, a psychoanalytically informed educational perspective, the Resolving Conflict Creatively Program (RCCP), and others.<br />This is not really a &quot;how-to&quot; book, any more than was Cohen's other book.  Readers will benefit, however, because he systematically reviews SEL programs, and readers will be eager to pursue specific programs from among those referenced.<br />I missed not seeing any work from Myrna B. Shure, who is a good cognitive-behavioral SEL practitioner (the &quot;I Can Problem Solve&quot; curriculum).  Does her work not involve young adolescents?  If not, that is a disappointment.<br />SEL is important because we all 'swim' in a social environment.  When that environment is caring and concerned, when students can make heart-informed choices, they 'swim' better and are said to learn better.  We certainly know they are happier and appear more productive.<br />I know many readers will gain a lot from this work, and the other related books in the SEL field.  Good luck!	2002-08-18

The New Leadership Charter School read the Folger Shakespeare Library edition for its 2002 Shakespeare Festival.  The entire school saw the play performed at Shakespeare & Co in Lenox, MA.<br />Several other books were helpful in preparing the teachers and students for discussing Macbeth:  (1) The Cambridge School Shakespeare edition, which has many wonderful suggestions for class activities (but which is more expensive than the Folger edition); (2) Peggy O'Brien, Shakespeare Set Free, which has a great section on teaching Macbeth; (3) LitPlans on CD, which has a number of pencil-and-paper activities about Macbeth; (4) Greenhaven Press's Readings on Macbeth, which has 16 interpretive chapters on Macbeth, all of which teachers and upper level high school students will find useful; (5) Two books of college-level lectures on Shakespeare, with chapters on Macbeth (A.C. Bradley and Harold C. Goddard); and (6) Nick Aitchison's history of midaeval Scotland, Macbeth: Man and Myth.<br />Amazon has all of this stuff, and I found them all very useful.<br />The one interpretive book that I did not find useful was Susanne Wofford's Shakespeare's Late Tragedies.	2002-08-18

This very good book presents school safety concerns from three perspectives: (1) the high salience of current safety issues; (2) in-depth discussion of seven standards for school safety; and (3) questions that parents, teachers, and safety experts ask about school safety.  He concludes with an appendix which gives the list of seven school safety standards and specific recommendations for each.<br />I thought this writer was clear, dispassionate, very informative, and useful.  He does not have a \\"theory of discipline,\\" but instead incorporates the best of both reflective and \\"conservative\\" disciplinary procedures.  He is keen on building student self-discipline and safety through appropriate use of information (rules themselves), consequences (logical), resolution, and restitution; but he does not shy away from considering alternative programs.  He was very informative about safety for Special Education youngsters.<br />Most readers for this book will be professional educators in training.  It is more helpful for curriculum specialists and administrators than for teachers, but the integration of classroom rules to school-wide rules receives serious consideration.	2002-08-13

Jonathan Cohen, the editor of this book, believes that social-emotional learning (SEL) is the heart of good education.  The reason?  Human beings grow in their social environments.  When children care about each other, and feel cared for, they learn--a lot more than in environments where they feel anxious, frightented, or \\"out.\\"  Unlike \\"self-esteem\\" advocates, however, Cohen believes that positive school environments can \\"challenge\\" students to grow, so he is not simply dispensing bromides to children.<br />Cohen believes there are about 300 SEL curricula available in the marketplace.  This book gives teachers and administrators a perspective from which to choose.  The contributors also point to implementation of SEL curricula.  The belief is that it takes 3 years, with consistent support to teachers and administrators, before SEL really \\"takes hold\\" in a school, although the results are faster in smaller schools and in younger children.  Cohen believes that thoughtful teachers can implement SEL in their classroom, even if the school administration is not implementing in other classrooms.<br />I particularly liked Stuart Twemlow's chapter on the bully-victim-bystander \\"drama\\" in school, and various approaches to intermittent power struggles in schools.  Another very interesting approach is Myrna Shure's I Can Problem Solve (ICPS), which is a cognitive-behavioral approach to early high-risk behaviors.<br />There are other books that are more \\"exercise\\" and \\"unit\\" oriented that can help teachers more directly.  Look on Amazon's book search for any writings by Ruth Charney (Northeast Foundation for Children), Roxann Kriete, Maurice Elias, and others that Amazon will pop up for you.<br />Great book!  Intended mostly for educators, this book is useful for all the \\"special disciplines\\" in school (psychologists, social workers, guidance counselors, administrators) as well as teachers interested in SEL.	2002-08-13

This is a college/university text of 15 essays on Macbeth, all written by college/university English lecturers and professors.

It is filled with post-modern criticism and headings like \\"On the Fringe of Patriarchal Discourse,\\" and a chapter on Macbeth as a male Medusa.<br />I hate giving negative reviews on Amazon, since readers tend to say that negative reviews are not helpful.  Oh, well.  Here are some other resources that will help you get good hands on Macbeth, which I used in setting a unit for 7th through 11th graders who were about to see Macbeth:<br />Peggy O'Brien, Shakespeare Set Free.  Great activities and thoughtful things that youngsters can do.  O'Brien is a great writer, too.<br />A.C. Bradley, Shakespearean Tragedy.  This is an old book, originally published in 1904, long before post-modernism, and it went through 26 printings.  Bradley gives the best description of what Shakespeare meant by tragedy.  Bradley does not have activities for youngsters, however.  Just a powerful way of thinking about Macbeth.<br />Greenhaven Press Literary Companion, Readings on Macbeth.  The Literary Companion series addresses Macbeth in 16 very informative chapters.  Topics include the historical context of Macbeth, dramatic allusions, witches, the poetry of evil, and so forth.  Very good essays, but not immediately translatable into activities for 7th thru 11th graders.<br />There!  I hope this was helpful.  If you purchase Wofford's book, you'll get an essay on male fear of maternal dominance, object relations theory applied to Macbeth. Bon chance.	2002-08-08

This book is a compendium of 44 articles on leadership, intended for higher education audiences, especially management students in college.  The authors also include 19 self-assessment instruments for the reader.  The book finishes with 11 case studies and &quot;experiential&quot; exercises (as opposed, I guess, to cognitive exercises?).<br />The topics are slanted toward social-psychological (roles, gender effects, group dynamics, leader behaviors, cross-cultural contexts, and so forth).  As a result, the writings can be tediously &quot;scientific.&quot;  The book is very well referenced, but, as the authors state, it is not a review of the leadership literature.<br />The cover drawing is one of five people putting sails on a boat that is not in the water.  I presume this is sort of a Magritte comment on leadership.  I think it also is a comment on the patchwork tedium of the subject.  And after all the sails are on, what does one know about leadership?  And, is one a leader?	2002-08-02

Prof. Seligman is one of the Deans of American psychotherapy and a founder of the cognitive-behavioral method of psychotherapy.  His interest in kids is obvious--as well as is his experience.<br />The theory revolves around several basic concepts.  At its most basic, What you think and what you do equals how you feel.  Prof. Seligman's method is designed to help children not draw inaccurate inferences (cognitions) from events and behavior (for example, \\"I'm a jerk\\" if someone does not play with you.)  He correctly notes that optimism and hopefulness are just as learned as is depression.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy, and drugs (psychopharmacology therapy) are the two main treatment modes with demonstrated positive results.<br />The method itself is quite simple and is very useful to children, families, parents, and adults who work with children.  I have given this book to parents and coaches.  However, the writing itself is more complicated than the theory--I suppose a Dean of psychotherapy is entitled--so readers will have to work at extracting Seligman's nuggets.  It's worth the time, no doubt.	2002-08-02

This book consists of 64 excerpts from (mostly) modern writers about leadership, with a social-psychological perspective.  (The non-modern excerpts are from, for example, Plato, Machiavelli, Tolstoy, Lao-tzu, Carlyle, etc.)  There are a couple of chapters dealing with women's leadership.  The editor, J. Thomas Wren, has struggled to find common grounds--e.g., modern views of leadership, leaders and followers together, the leadership environment.  Nearly all writings are slanted toward social-psychological, around concepts like \\"transaction,\\" \\"transforming,\\" behavioral theories, system perspectives, influence, tactics, organizational decision-making, and so forth.<br />A friend noted the paucity of \\"high quality\\" mass leadership in today's America--he was speaking of the Enron mess and the financial predations of high-power executive America, the corruption of the political process by highly expensive campaigns, the stagnation of our drug \\"war,\\" and the pervasive ironic cynicism in public commentary.  This book does not deal with the absence of leadership, unfortunately, or the inability of America to handle fast-moving problems (such as global warming, and our contribution to it)--but it is great background material and well worth reading.	2002-03-01

Reader reviews on the 4th edition are split (see below), but I liked this book in the calculus class I was taking at University of Massachusetts.  The breadth is good (almost too much for a two-semester class), the content well presented, and, yes, many problem sets are well done (although I learned to hate related rates problems in the first semester).  Students will need some additional materials, however: (1) the Student Solutions Manual (James Stewart, 4th ed.) which gives the answers to all odd-numbered problems (Brooks/Cole guards its teachers' answers and reserves the even-numbered ones for the teachers' edition).  (2) The CD/ROM Journey Through Calculus (Win 98/2, Pentium II or &gt;) was helpful in the first semester, but less so in the second.  Most teachers require use of a TI-86 calculator, so you will need not only the TI manual sold with the calculator, but also (3) Single Variable Calculus 4th ed., James Stewart (&quot;Calclabs with the TI85/86&quot;), which was annoying because the sequence of button-pushing was not all that clear, and the correct answers to problems are not given (so you have no way to check)--but you need the book to figure out the TI-86, which is not intuitively obvious.<br />I sometimes wonder: what other calculus books are out there?  And how much of a market share does Brooks/Cole have, with this integrated set of materials?	2002-02-02

This author has created a semester-long guide for a high school leadership class.  She covers the theory and some of the skills of leaders.  As such, it is more cognitive than not, and even though she uses daily class exercises and feedback, it is not experiential.  Her curriculum guide does not involve group projects or group process.  She is oriented more toward intellectual and using ego-ideals than experience.  She has midterm and final exams in this book.<br />Nevertheless, many of her points are well taken and worth reading.<br />For teachers interested in building classroom experiences that affect skills of leaders (e.g., active listening, self-concept and self-esteem, values, vision and goals, stress management), you might consider Susan Fritz's Interpersonal Skills for Leadership (Prentice-Hall, 1999), even though it is written for a college-level class.  Using both MacGregor and Fritz, you will be able to create a very interesting set of cognitive and experiential lessons, aimed at both conceptual and skill-building outcomes.	2002-01-24

Appreciative Inquiry is a method for getting the best, most positive, upbeat, and energizing images of your organization to the fore.  AI contrasts to problem-focused inquiry, which usually provokes blame and evasion.  A large cadre of Organizational Development and Human Resources types has developed AI, and they swear by its positive effects.  The book contains nearly two dozen case examples of AI interventions, ranging from small organization to large multi-national corporations.  The authors present a coherent theory (social constructionism) and method to bolster AI's techniques.  It has much in common with post-modern psychotherapy, the construction of \\"magic solutions\\" (\\"best practices\\" in their terms), and centering on the individuals' perspectives (rather than some larger, \\"objective\\" truth) about an organization.<br />It is clear that you have to be sophisticated to do AI interventions.  One imagines that you should belong to an AI network, be thoroughly trained, and be supervised.  The AI intervention probably does not work without the requisite OD/HR training and perspective.  If you are interested, this is your textbook.<br />I found the book moderately difficult to read and digest, partly because the authors have created such an elaborate theory behind the intervention.  The authors are less than candid about \\"failed\\" interventions (p. 206), and terms like \\"co-creating\\" and \\"sociotechnical\\" (what?).  I came away from this book believing that AI is something like Public Discourse applied to businesses.<br />If you want to use this book, plan on studying it in detail and enrolling in AI workshops.	2002-01-23

The author is a professor of management at RIT in Rochester, and a clinical psychologist.  It is clear he has no love of post-modern therapy, because most of the self-sabotage that he talks about comes from the individuals themselves, and the scripts they bring to work, not their company, not the work demanded of them, and not from their circumstances.  He is best in his insistence on confronting the individual's patterns of behavior, or, really, misbehavior, which stem from faulty self-esteem, faulty anger control, depression and political blunders.  You get a sense he does not let his patients pull a lot over him; he confronts your shortcomings directly, and this is probably the essence of the book.<br />The problem is inside you, not your company or your work situation.  If you are a victim, it is your own fault, and your own problem to fix.<br />I found the book very telling.  My family members have suffered repeated demotions, firings, unhappiness at work, and divorces over the years.  I have lost three excellent career opportunities due to self-sabotage.  While I found the book telling, its prescriptions are remarkably simple:  figure it out, get over it, and fly straight.  Thus, his method is more cognitive and rational-emotional than analytical, but you know that, under the surface, he has dealt with a lot of personality disorders.	2002-01-23

Uncritical and glorifying, the author's love touches the reader, but he adds little to our understanding of the history, tradition, or educational methods of West Point.	2002-01-19

They address a difficult question in adolescent growth: how can we promote the development of young leaders?  They propose a stage theory of leadership development in teens, over five leadership skill areas (information and thinking, attitudes, communication, decision-making, and stress-management) in three chronological developmental levels (\\"I'm not a leader,\\" \\"I am a leader,\\" and \\"I'm going to step up and do it\\").  The general thrust of development and leadership training is toward ever-more responsible and conscious decision-making and action on the part of the teen.  They are looking to develop persons who \\"influence others in an ethical and socially responsible way.\\"<br />Few books address leadership development in adolescents, but this one does.  It is a great relief from business-oriented \\"leadership\\" books, such as Jack Welch's Straight from the Gut, which promote ersatz values and celebrity status as examples of leadership.  Instead, these authors see the teaching of leadership as one of the most ethical acts that a community of caring adults can provide for teens.  They see leadership as a central element in democratic and humane behavior.  This book is not, however, a \\"how to\\" book and contains no experiential exercises or adventure tasks.<br />The authors stop short, however, of examining in detail why we do not do better in educating young leaders.  It is not clear why they do not take the next obvious step, to advocate that leadership skills (which they outline well) should be embedded into the social curriculum of all middle and high schools, on a daily basis.  After all, if we are serious about developing young leaders in society, perhaps we should be more explicit about it, and weave a deliberate web of development into every teenager's life.	2002-01-18

The author is a professor of management at USC, so his perspectives on leadership are limited to those qualities found in executives and in very large businesses that support the training of executives.  The most helpful aspect of his book is that McCall urges large companies to develop systematic training for executive leaders, rather than leaving younger executives in a sink-or-swim situation.  He also has a bias against ruthless, cut-throat competition and male testosterone-driven demonstrations of power and wealth that executives can get drawn into or promote.<br />Nevertheless, the book is limited: it says very little about leadership as a quality found in other people, other settings; implies that leadership is a unique quality of exceptional people that can be taught to those up-and-coming risers primarily; and supporting data is quite limited.  He stumbles when he talks about leadership per se by using an example of a child violin prodigy, as if this child-becoming-virtuoso should be our model of leadership development.<br />It also is overwritten, the way stuff from Harvard Business School Press is overwritten: breathless, breathtaking, fawning over winners, etc.	2002-01-18

The Folger Library edition of Shakespeare&#8217;s Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream has the best documentation, so this is what New Leadership Charter School (Springfield, MA) used in its recent Shakespeare Festival. The Cambridge School Edition is easier to read (larger print), has good documentation, and makes interpretive analytic points that the Folger edition does not have, but it costs more. Teachers should note the book edited by Peggy O&#8217;Brien, Shakespeare Set Free, which has a good 24-item curriculum on teaching a unit on Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream. (The book also treats Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth.) This is an excellent resource. Another good resource for teachers is the CD-ROM, &#8220;LitPlans on CD: A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream.&#8221; It has good vocabulary drills, class activities (e.g., Scrambled Names), crossword puzzles, and so forth. At an interpretive level (say, for a college-level class), consider Readings on A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream, edited by Stephen P. Thompson, a part of the Greenhaven Press Literary Companion series. I found several chapters very useful, e.g., the play&#8217;s festive spirit, the depiction of female power, dreams and the play&#8217;s structure, reason and imagination, and so forth. Less helpful was Bloom&#8217;s Notes on the play (Harold Bloom, editor), which had basic thematic and structural analysis, but critical views were simply reprints and abstracts of ancient articles from English journals.  This is one of Shakespeare&#8217;s delightful and lyric comedies, and kids from the 6th grade up can understand elements of this play. Give the Folger Library edition a whirl; you will not be disappointed.	2001-08-27

Chester Finn's new book is said to be the best book on charter schools yet written.  And in many respects, it is.  He and his two co-authors have packed in statistics and numbers, and they have reported interesting interviews and sidebars from persons who have started or implemented charter schools.  They remain upbeat about the ultimate outcome of charter schools, and believe that by the year 2010 we will have witnessed a proliferation of school choice in America.<br />I love their optimism, and I wish I could be so optimistic, too.  Finn and his colleagues believe the unions will eventually accommodate to the charter schools and quit trying to kill them with thousands of small cuts.  They believe that charter schools, which exemplify American inventiveness and determination, will survive the non-existent capital funding, which prevents them from building and owning their own facilities.  (You do not have to have a MBA to figure out that charter school rents are paid from lower teachers' salaries.)  They even believe that charter schools will eventually force, by market competition, the public schools to change.<br />I cannot see exactly why the unions will quit their attacks, why public authorities will open the capital facilities question, or how charter schools will avoid massive re-regulation (as in special education or bilingual education).<br />For these reasons, then, I think Finn and his colleagues are persuasive idealists, but I am not persuaded.  Even 3,000 charter schools across the country will not change the face of public education in America.  Only when parents receive vouchers will there really be a free-market change.  Charter schools are just the way-station.  Not bad ones, but not the revolutionary change that Finn imagines.	2001-06-03

Kilbourne writes about the psychology of mass marketing, which is something she detests and refuses to let go of.  Her remarks are often cloyingly accurate--that mass marketing turns people in addicts, disconnects people from genuine and authentic feeling, substitutes objects for people, turns people into objects, and values consumerism above community.  Given that mass advertising is the water that we fishies swim in (nearly a zillion ads by the time we are ten years old), it's a pretty depressing and gives me a quasi-paranoid headache.<br />In contrast to another reviewer, however, I did not think Kilbourne was in the least bit funny.  Angry--and she has enough to be angry about, every day, ranging from TV to magazines--but no, not funny.<br />Nevertheless, she writes very well and convincingly.

The essays are arranged in themes (e.g., &quot;Old New York,&quot;  &quot;Victims and Victors&quot;) around particular authors (e.g., Edith  Wharton, Henry James, the Prairie poets, and so forth).  Her essays concern  novelists and short-story writers, but she has several essays on those who  come from poetry, drama, and non-fiction prose.  Her introductory essay,  &quot;Locations,&quot; is worth the price of the book alone.<br />Elizabeth  Hardwick writes so fluently that you find her drawing imaginative  comparisons, remarkable analogies, and passionate connections.  She strikes  me as forgiving the personal foibles and erratic paths of some writers,  while she searches for how these informed the writings.<br />My favorite  essay was her commentary on the American novelist Joan Didion (&quot;In the  Wasteland&quot;), whose &quot;unconsoling&quot; work is &quot;a carefully  designed frieze on the fracture and splinter of her characters'  comprehension of the world,&quot; marked by a peculiar unease and  restlessness.  Yet she also considers &quot;older&quot; American novelists  (Melville, even has comments on Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Wharton).  Her  essays about more modern writers (the loss of bearing, from Fitzgerald's  Gatsby to Capote's murderers, to Mailer's squalid &quot;real&quot; life)  are also remarkable.<br />I am puzzled that Hardwick has no essays about  American protest literature, or any reformulation images.  She does not  write about any African-American writer, and I wonder about this omission.  Is she saying implicitly that these writers have no location in American  literature?	2000-09-15

Michael Stone has written a book that takes us beyond the fictions of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;--to describe how a  homicide unit, initially established to combat New York's soaring homicide  rate, actually brought down the drug-driven gangs that dominated  Manhattan's upper West Side, the Bronx, and Brooklyn.  He writes with  energy and enthusiasm about the individuals involved in this unit, the  bureaucratic struggles, the courts and jails, and you are left with a vivid  sense of the work and difficulties faced by these investigators,  prosecutors, and judges.<br />He also has an excellent lead-in chapter about  New York's economic decline and the changes of the 1960s and 1970s that  coincided with the infestation of drugs; and the various political forces  that impinged on the police force, including the anti-corruption efforts of  reformers.<br />This was a great read on a weekend day.

In the 1930s he clearly had a grasp on the directions of  mathematics, but his slant definitely is toward geometry and calculus.  He  does not even mention mathematical logicians.<br />I liked the personal  descriptions of the lives of mathematicians.  Yet this book only begins to  give a slant on the history of development of mathematics, the cross  currents of the field.

(This review applies only to the Folger Shakespeare Library Edition)  Most curriculum guides (e.g., State of Massachusetts, McREL) say that Romeo &amp; Juliet is an upper middle-school play.  It can be treated as a short tragedy (3,159 lines overall) and involves a number of strands from  both the Theater and English/Language Arts guidelines.<br />This is the best  book for individual students to purchase, because it is inexpensive and  well organized.<br />I found another version more helpful for teachers--the  Cambridge School Series edition of R&amp;J.  This costs more, but has a  number of excellent activities and discussions that teachers can  use.<br />Also, don't forget some video versions of the play, available  through Amazon's video store.  The 1964 Zefirrelli R&amp;J features a  comely lass but also reflects an Italian director's ideas about a young  girl sobbing.  The 1996 Dicaprio/Danes &quot;moderne&quot; version, set in  &quot;Verona Beach,&quot; is excellent, but you will see that major  sections of dialogue have been cut, in favor of music and the visual  expressiveness inherent in film.  The 1992 HBO/Thames Films version is the  most accurate in terms of dialogue, but also runs 3 hours.  Also, there is  Prokofiev's ballet, which, as you can imagine, reflects the Russian  composer's genius--who else could do the ballet scene of the death vault,  where all movement stops?<br />	2000-08-01

Orlando Patterson's thesis is that America's experience with slavery and post-Reconstruction violence against black persons(extending over another 100 years), and black men in particular, continues to taint and distort American race relations. On one hand, he writes breathtakingly well, passionately, fluidly, and coherently. It is hard not to feel the shame and sorrow of American racial life. On the other hand, he characterizes modern racial life - and especially the thinking of white men - as tortured as that which preceded the Civil Rights era. His examples? Dennis Rodman and his sexual encounter with Madonna. O.J. and the murder of Nichole. By using these examples, he substitutes (white? male?) prurient interests for good sociological analysis and the results of yellow journalism and bad justice for coherent models of how America thinks about race.<br />He is a brilliant writer, so he almost carries it off. Almost.<br />I was reminded of Garcia Lorca's play, Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding). In America, we are wedded together, at times loving one another and at times drenched in the blood of our past. Even this fine writer and thinker knows that we cannot restore innocence to our thinking and behavior, which is why Lift Every Voice is the first hymn in our hymnal. In the face of our bloodlust we can never find innocence, but better to go ahead as best we can than to be captured in the idea that our bloodlust is permanent, indelible, and inevitable. Can we never truly love one another, as our ancestors could not and did not?	2000-07-14

Heifetz creates a psychological-social-political theory of leadership, which he defines as &quot;an activity&quot; that allows for &quot;adaptive work.&quot;  Leadership is the work that points out discrepancies beetween  what we say we do, and what we actually do; or between our values  (democracy, inclusion) and our actions.  Leadership ultimately involves  reconciling our values to our behavior.  Leadership is not merely finding  &quot;technical&quot; solutions to &quot;adaptive problems,&quot; but,  instead, is about finding more congruence (for both leaders and followers)  between what they say and hope, and what they do.<br />The author's writing is  very clear.<br />I most liked his simple phrasing of complex issues; how the  threads through the incomplete theories of leadership (Carlyle, James  MacGregor Burns); his practical orientation; his emphasis on followers'  responsibility; his way of describing how leadership fails; and his notions  of leadership succession.  I also liked that this is not a &quot;how to  do&quot; leadership book (the &quot;ten best ways to be a leader&quot;  genre) aimed at a particular audience (business leaders, educational  leaders), but, instead, is a thought-provoking discussion of ideas about  leadership.	2000-06-06

Galileo wrote that philosophy is written in the grand book of the universe, in a language of characters, circles, triangles, and other figures.  Somewhere in this grand offering came the number e, which is the  limit of the expression (1+1/n)^n, as n approaches infinity.  It is a  curiosity number, one that bridges Napier's original logarithms (which are  to the base 1/e) and the origins of calculus.  It was discovered at a time  of exploding international trade, which is based on compound interest,  whose formula you will recognize in the definition of e.  It is the base of  natural logarithms, a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal.  e cannot be  the solution to a quadratic equation that has integer coefficients.<br />This  is a splendid book about a number as strange and useful as pi.  Well  written, this book can be handled by bright high school students and  college students who have an interest not in solving math problems (the way  we usually teach math), but in the history of math and this curious number.

Lial and Hornsby have written a college-level intermediate algebra text that demonstrates the best and the worst of US math instruction.  On the positive side, this is a lavishly produced book: great detail, lots of  graphs and clearly ordered explanations, excellent colors, nearly 1 1/4  inches thick with what they consider the 11 essentials of intermediate  algebra (listed above in the Amazon.com notes).  The books comes from  Addison-Wesley-Longman, from which you can purchase an integrated set of  videos and CD-ROM of testing problems (not used or viewed for this review).  Theirs truly is a work of love.  On the other hand, they represent the  most tedious part of American math instruction, which is interminable  problems--5,921, to be exact--which roll through the book, section after  section.  Their extraordinary work makes me wonder how any college math  teacher in a 3-credit course could hope to get through 2% of the problems  in a semester.  Many of the problems are repetitious, going over the same  features (of problem solving) again and again.  I fear that only the grinds  and math gearheads will appreciate this.<br />Even more worrisome, however, is  the absence of conceptual integration, other than that these 11 topics are  &quot;important&quot; if you want to go to advanced algebra or college  geometry.  The one pertinent conceptual comment was that polynomials are to  algebra as numbers are to arithmetic, but the authors never followed up on  this.  It is not clear, for example, why inverse functions are related (or  not) to conic sections.  The handling of systems of linear equations  borrowed liberally from matrix algebra, but the authors chose not to  demonstrate more general solutions and stuck with solving the problems  &quot;manually.&quot;<br />More than concepts in math, American students know  how to solve problems, which presumably is why this book, reflecting its  intended audience, is so problem-saturated.  Even so, when we test our best  students against the best from other countries, we do not fare too well.  Perhaps it is because we ignore the structure of the thinking in math, and  substitute problem-solving instead.  The result is that attentive students  will know the notes, and some will know the notes quite well, but not the  music.students against the best from other countries, we do not fare too well.

In this sense, then, Gardner's book continues a tradition that  disappoints.<br />This is not to say his essays in creative and gifted leaders  are not interesting-although some are not interesting, such as the portrait  of Alfred P. Sloan of GM-or that his list of desirable leadership traits is  off base.  Gardner does attempt to say things that other leadership writers  do not-such as the need for the leader to create a unifying \\"story,\\" and  how the audience (or \\"followers\\") affects the leader's range of  capabilities.  At the end of the book, however, you have had a whole bag of  leadership popcorn, and still are hungry.	2000-05-24

This is a very interesting and quite good book about the US invasion of Haiti and the restoration of the Jean-Bertrand Aristide regime.  It centers around a Special Forces group in the boonies, whose job it was to make sure  that the transition to &quot;democracy&quot; did not get blown up, and that  the American soldiers were &quot;safe.&quot;  (Our soldiers were not tasked  to improve any amenities of Haitian life, such as roads, bridges,  marketplaces, or schools, although there was some involvement with helping  piece together the electrical grid.)  Along the way are great sections on  the history of Haiti, the original slave rebellions, class and wealth, the  Carter/Clinton deal with Gen. Cedras and his crew of thieves, the common  thuggery of an impoverished state, and the internal workings of the US  Army, particularly the splits in command between infantry and special  forces.  It is a source of wonder and amazement that our soldiers, the best  trained assault soldiers in the world, maintained steady discipline through  six months of ambiguity and privation.  Shacochis has little good to say  about the very-high-level upper commands, which he thinks were out of touch  with the day-to-day ground situation, and in one instance cashiered a  captain capriciously and in another instance court-martialled another  captain who protested Haitian human rights violations (overcrowded, filthy  jails, no due process) too vigorously.  He concludes that our troops risked  their lives not so much for democracy as to restore order, where enemies  became newly found &quot;friends&quot; and ex-thugs were incorporated into  the newly reincorporated local governments.  Truly an excellent book.	2000-05-16

I do not want to repeat what the above Amazon reviewers have already said.  Nevertheless, I think Heifetz's Leadership Without Easy Answers is the  best book on the modern theory of leadership around.<br />Heifetz integrates  &quot;great man/great woman&quot; (trait) theories of leadership with  &quot;great times&quot; (situational) theories, and defines  &quot;leadership&quot; as &quot;an activity that fosters adaptive work and  addresses the value conflicts that people hold.&quot;  He distinguishes  &quot;technical&quot; problems that may not require leadership (adaptive  work) from &quot;adaptive problems&quot; which people experience as  threatening to themselves or their group.  (The conflict over abortion, for  instance, can be seen as an adaptive problem, because it represents a value  conflict that provokes work-avoidance--scapegoating, dishonesty, polarizing  conversations, etc.)<br />Heifetz sees leadership as being  &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;authentic&quot;, and the leader is always  working towards using authority (formal and informal) to help members of  contesting groups arrive at solutions that promote fundamental values (such  as democracy, equality before the law, freedom).<br />This book is not a  &quot;how-to&quot; book and does not promote charismatic leadership (which  the author would view as largely work-avoidance and dependency-fostering).  Heifetz is an excellent writer and communicates well with both academics  and interested citizens.	2000-05-11

Ravitch and her contributors assess new political and educational policy initiatives from a positive, clear-headed point of view, toward the goal of understanding what works well, and how to make that happen elsewhere.<br />The emphasis on school improvement, away from what Ravitch calls the &quot;decrepit factory model of schooling,&quot; calls for a discussion of (i) the history of school improvement movements, (ii) the emergence of structural reforms in the early 1990s, including vouchers, contracting, charters, and deregulation, and (iii) specific examples of system-wide reforms from Chicago, the Milwaukee vouchers, and the Edison project.  Good examples of deregulation include Texas Governor George W. Bush reducing state-imposed regulation on local districts from 490 to 230, and Michigan Governor John Engler a similar proportion.<br />This book grew out of a seminar hosted at New York University from 1994-1996.  There is newer information available, for example, on the Milwaukee charters, but these contributors are not dated and convey their hopes and ideals about education fully.  Chester Finn is always a pungent writer and worth reading.  I especially liked Valerie Lee's chapter on the promise and results of Catholic school education.<br />I think Ravitch's contributions to educational reform are unique.  Trained as a historian, she brings to the discussion of educational reform a new and refreshing viewpoint.  You do not have to be a policy wonk to enjoy this book.  END	2000-05-07
US	52950632	R2O5JS4WXDLBPR	0300036248	178890253	Afro-American Literature in the Twentieth Century: The Achievement of Intimacy	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	A useful and difficult book	Michael Cooke's discussion of 20th century African-American literature comes from the best methods and writing available to comparative literature specialists.  He discusses in detail how the historical position of  African-Americans affected the development of literature motifs and styles,  especially around the portrayal of &quot;self,&quot; which, due to the  profound racism of America, always involved either veiling the self (for  protection and ironic subversion of white dominance) or  movement-toward-intimacy (in the face of dangers and distortions).  His  themes develop from W.E.B. Du Bois' articulation of &quot;the veil&quot; in  Souls of Black Folks, and, as Henry Gates says, the development of an  authentic black American aesthetic.<br />Cooke's writing is elegant and  comprehensive.  You have to be a dedicated reader, however.  The themes are  clearly stated, but his ability to use multiple sources and references  requires some substantial background and adept thinking.  I believe that  sections of this book would be appropriate for an honors-level high school  African-American literature course, or the whole text for a college-level  US or African-American literature course.<br />I believe that Cooke's insight  into the development of intimacy within the black literary spectrum is well  worth considering.	2000-04-20

These are easy exercises to learn and implement, but they presume the development of  intimacy and therefore are not useful for groups that need merely to  articulate opinions, brainstorm, or problem-solve.<br />Some of these  exercises are appropriate for teenaged groups.  Other exercises, e.g.,  eyes-closed touch, or group massage, will require some extra lead-in time,  to manage anxiety.<br />Some of the &quot;trust building&quot; exercises are  well known and are part of any reasonable group development course, for  example, backwards falls.  You can find these in other programs, for  example, Project Adventure.<br />Still, a reasonable collection of things to  do.  Group facilitators will need to think through exactly how to implement  these, and not merely take them &quot;out of the can.&quot;	2000-04-20
US	52950632	ROYMDR6BJJ77I	0070507058	47853157	Analyzing The Curriculum	Books	4	18	19	N	N	A good start to understanding curriculum changes, and fights	Posner's field is curriculum development, and he has written extensively about how teachers, administrators, supervisors, and ultimately the public thinks about curriculum and curriculum reform.  In this book, Analyzing the  Curriculum, he presents tools to understand the conflicts within education  and education reform, by underlining the implicit assumptions in all forms  of curriculum reform.  These assumptions include (1) how learners learn,  (2) how teachers teach, (3) the locus of reform (university-based,  collegially based in the school); (4) the political contexts of reform.  He  provides several detailed examples of curriculum analysis, ranging from  Jerome Bruner's Man: A Course of Study and Jerrold Zacharias' Physical  Science Study Committee (both university-based reform curricula) to the  &quot;whole language&quot; movement.  In each case he is fair to the merits  and demerits of the curriculum in question.<br />This is the kind of book you  can imagine teacher education colleges use.  It has a steep price and  apparently  is not discounted.	1999-12-09

She had only 163 student teaching-days per year, and 73% of her children were at  the poverty level.  Class sizes ranged from 29 to 32.  In this context,  Carr gives a clear and ample description of what she does, how she does it,  the level of detailed thinking and organization, and her methods for  handling slips and pulls within the child's growing repertoire of reading,  writing, and spelling.  Fully two-thirds of her day is devoted to Language  Arts, and she also uses projects and families to support her devoted  attention in this area.<br />This is a great book for beginning teachers, and  persons who are interested in classroom &quot;management&quot; of time,  materials, students, and physical locations.  Her &quot;reflective  teaching&quot; is extraordinary:  she finds a place where her children can  belong, and shine forth.<br />I found it interesting because Carr's devotion  shines through: she provides over 800 books in her first- and second-grade  classrooms.  This is a dedicated person and educator.	1999-11-17

The authors understand the difficulties of beginning teachers, the schisms in  their thinking (do I teach the subject first? or classroom rules first?),  and the pulls on their energies.  The authors provide an excellent summary  of how to arrange the social, emotional, and cognitive elements of  instruction; the rules and principles for encouraging student excellence;  and the overarching principles that are brought to bear on the  student-teacher relationship.<br />This is a textbook appropriate for  student teachers, and for those who would want to teach better.	1999-11-16
