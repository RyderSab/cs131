You can almost see their actions shine through with each page you turn. And the chemistry between Rafe and Willow.

The book was truly a masterpiece.<BR>Carolyn Brown never loses her touch with any of her writings. She only gets better and better!!!!!!!! I've said that before. I will continue to say that.

Two thumbs up and six stars to this book, The Marshal's Destiny. If you have yet to read it, believe me you will not be disappointed. A mind tingling, heart melting sensation that will indeed have you on the edge of your seat. Honest edge of your seat drama. It was like I was sitting in front of a big screen watching all the action. When Maggie had to drive the stagecoach when Seth was injured and her thoughts turned to Joshua when she whispered his name, it was awesome! The way they were almost miles apart from each other yet so close was incredible. It was like you were cheering, no turn here or go there and you will find each other. Then when Joshua thought of Maggie in the arms of another when he saw her being greeted by another man, my heart melted. Not to mention he didn't come to be sociable and she cornered him the same way. I can't say enough about this book! Joshua and Maggie, I will never forget. A must read! I am so glad that I bought it! This was an incredible love story. I want to read more of the brothers and others in the book and hope they perhaps have their own series down the road. This book was absolutely captivating! Ida and her husband and all of the characters were a family that sticks in your mind after you have finished the last page.<BR>Again hats off to Ms. Admirand. I noticed that Jeffrey J. Faville did the cover illustration and design on this one too. (He also did the one for Maggie's Mistake). He does excellent cover illustration and designs.	2003-03-19

Never a disappointment with any of Carolyn Brown's books. Emmas's Folly was great. Violet's Wish wonderful, but Maggie's Mistake will always be a touching remarkable love story between two hearts that were meant to be together from day one. Ms. Brown's books get better and better with every word that she puts on paper. This one I have read three times. I buy her books because I know there will never be a disappointment in any of her writings. <BR>At first the two characters are a bit stubborn in confessing their love for one another but in time their hearts open up allowing them to see they were meant for each other. A drawing together yet pulling away by two souls searching but never quite reaching out to grab what is right in front of their eyes. A love that others can so openly see when they are together. I loved this story. If two people were ever meant to be in love, Everett and Maggie were. And for Ms. Brown to introduce James and Elenor and their story - Kudos! Great thinking! She's a great writer! To see through Maggie's eyes all the new discoveries and adventures was enough to not only cause Everett's heart to elate but mine as well. I was swept away by every bit of their journey. The story was tender, touching and made your heart soar. The whole book was superb! I loved the parts of banter with Carolina and Maggie throughout the story. I'd say Anna Marie and Carolina should spend a month locked away in a small dug out for a month. That might be a help for them. The heart touching words when Maggie spoke to Everett on the way to Ruby's not to mention afterwards over Everett's amazement for Maggie that rolled in his mind. The chat over the sister and James when she and Everett were at Violet's home. Ms. Brown has once again created a remarkable masterpiece. I am so glad that it ended the way it did because I thought I might have to go find the two and club them both if their hearts hadn't opened up. Twelve stars and two thumbs way up for Maggie's Mistake! The cover illustration by Jeffrey J. Faville was very good.	2003-03-13

One that you will want to keep on your shelf and read over and over again. You can't help but fall in love with Brianna and Trey, and the boys that she sets out to help in the beginning. This was a most tender moving love story from the beginning of her capture of Trey to the end. I loved the way that Brianna was a strong and determined woman. The way that Trey slowly falls for her and the admiration they both have for each other is so touching. The soft tension between the two makes you want to finish the book as soon as you begin it.

I have always loved Loretta Lynn and thought her to be like family. I watched Coal Miner's Daughter and fell in love with it. I knew the movie probably had left some things out or added some moments that wasn't right. But if you only listen to Ms. Lynn in her speech and her singing, you can find that she is an honest woman and down to earth. I really enjoyed this book. I loved the part about the wringing of the chicken neck and the tourists. Some people just go into a supper market and buy meats, they don't really know what the process use to be for others. This book is about life. Thanks for sharing the moments with us. I wanted to wake up this morning and go to Hurricane Mills and see her. Been here in Nashville for two years and haven't really seen many people. Did go to the Opry twice to take my mom but Ms Lynn wasn't preforming. This book is a keeper.

Even better go out and buy it. You will not be disappointed. The second book, after Emma's Folly, and one that will hold your attention from the first page to the last is a delightful book read. From the moment that the wounded man falls on Violet's front porch to the last page where your heart leaps for joy because of a happy ending, you are on the edge of your seat with this book. And when an unmarried woman, even a widow woman allows, an injured man to enter her house, you know there is going to be talk abounding everywhere. There's always that roaring gossip that some people can't wait to spread like a wildfire. You're right, the woman that we wanted to stomp to put those flames out is back. Can anyone forget Anna Marie from the first book when she tried to keep our Emma and Jed apart? She is back creating mischief again. <br />The characters in this book will have you laughing and crying. When Jim finds out about the person staying with Violet, naturally he has to head straight over and voice his opinion, being a man and all. I couldn't help but to laugh out loud with some of his comments he directed to Violet. This is truly a wonderful book to read. <br />When Violet soon discovers who the injured man is, she realizes she knows him. The memories all come flying back even thicker than before. A love that has been burning inside the two people, all these years, still consuming them as they banter with each over the littlest things. Even the little episode with the puppies was heartfelt. Puppies and children have a way of bringing grown-ups to their senses. You couldn't help but feel no matter how hurt the two had been; their loving hearts was like the coals of a dying fire still lingering. And nothing, not even drowning water poured over that little flicker of flame was going to put that fire out. At times, I wondered whom did I want to pull off to the side and give a sharp tongue lashing to first, Violet or Orrin. <br />This book is fabulous. Ten plus again for Carolyn Brown!!! She indeed has done it again!!! I have never been disappointed in a Carolyn Brown book. And I know for a fact, I never will. If the tornado from the first book had you on the edge of your seat, the fire will practically consume you. The emotions afterwards when Orrin couldn't find his Violet, the caring, every word that Carolyn Brown instills during this time leaves you mesmerized. If that doesn't have you hooked then the thoughts rushing through Violet's head when the evil men once again return to finish their dastardly deeds will have your heart slam into your chest. When the thoughts of Violet willing to risk death over rejecting Orrin at the altar troubled her mind, I couldn't help but feel emotion during this moment. The thought of him having to live with rejection, to her, was much worse than her death for her beloved Orrin. That was an emotional moment right then.<br />This book not only is fabulous but incredible. They indeed did make beautiful music together but it wasn't just for hours. It turned into a lifetime. What turned into years of being separated, ended up in music that brought them back together after all the odds that had been before them. A love that would last throughout all ages and reap many bountiful rewards. I loved this book. I loved these characters. Carolyn Brown once again brought us new family members to place in our home, right alongside, Emma, Jed and their family. I am getting weepy eyed now thinking about them. And just like Emma's Folly, after reading it, I had to read it again. I will have to read Violet's Wish again. It is one of those books that stays with you forever. Just like a loving family should be. And a loving man and woman when they say I do. Go out and get this book. You will enjoy it!!! Carolyn Brown fans will not be disappointed.	2002-08-07

O'Conner	If anyone is looking for a fabulous book read, I would suggest Falcon's Return. I fell in love with the character of Marshall and Brooke.

From the first page to the last, I didn't want to put the book down. Even the birds made the whole story a must read.

It leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen to the characters. When my boss handed it to me to read at work, I was sure that I wouldn't care for it but it was fantastic. And I am so glad that it had a happy ending where two people found each other. It was well written and the part about the Indian had me guessing until the end. Excellent reading.	2002-05-27

There is so much to learn from Sarah in the book concerning, life, dropping everything to go out west to find gold, to find heartache and eventually love. Sarah Glory is a good book for any reader who loves historical romances and earlier times. After reading what others had to suffer, you find yourself being blessed for the simple things that you have in life. Sarah Glory is a good book read.	2002-05-27

I can not begin to tell you how it made my day when I finished reading it. It was so GREAT that I read it again. And I am going to purchase it to go with my collection of other books I have, with this one being number one. It leaves you wishing that the story could continue. After reading about little Molly and the way she clung to Emma, I awoke the next morning wondering where my Emma was. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to push Matthew into another county. I am so glad the way Emma handled Anne Marie, too. I wanted to tell Jed to stop being so stubborn. I even wanted to send him a telegram to get to Atlanta and bring Emma home where she belonged. These characters leave you wishing that you were there with them. And the part during the tornado. If you have ever been in that situation, you are as much sitting on edge while you are reading that chapter as if you are in your own cellar waiting for the storm to pass. Ms. Brown is an excellent writer and should get thumbs up all the way to heaven. If Oprah ever needed to find a book that truly expressed love, devotion and a caring spirit that touches your heart, not to mention, have you awake with the characters still floating in your mind, she should read Emma's Folly. My goodness, Carolyn Brown is terrific!!!! If you don't read this book, you have missed something wonderful. It is a breath of fresh air. And we need that everyday. I can hardly wait to read the others ones.	2002-04-16
