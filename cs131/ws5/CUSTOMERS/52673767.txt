The title of the book sets out its thesis pretty clearly, but what it doesn't show is the methodology the authors use in making their claim.  After a roughly 30-year cycle of Republican majority (including the Republican Congress of 6 of Clinton's 8 years), Judis and Teixeira predict that we are on the cusp of a perhaps thirty year cycle of Democratic supremacy in Congress and in the White House.<br />To make this claim, they look at voting trends and data of the last 70 years (though they focus on the last four elections).  Their argument is that with the growth of postindustrial \\"ideopolises\\" across the country (cities and suburbs that are more dependent on the creation of ideas and services than goods) and the end of the backlash against '60s liberalism, its only a matter of time (barring additional incidents like September 11th) before the Democrats reascend to their heights of the '30s to '60s.<br />It's a compelling argument, and their use of statistics and solid voting data helps a lot.  If it's not required reading in both the Bush and Kerry camps it should be.  It suffers a little for having been written before the 2002 midterms, but the new afterword written in 2003 for the paperback edition helps recitfy that.  It could also use a little ethnography to go with its statistics and political science, too.<br />In spite of that, this book should be a must for pundits in this election cycle.  Anyone with an interest in how Americans vote (if not always why they vote they way they do) should read it, too.  It's vastly more useful than all the exposes, testimonials and pseudohistorical analyses that the average bookstore's \\"Politics\\" section is littered with...	2004-03-08

Pocket Books' Lost Era series, encompassing the time between the beginning sequence in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and the first Next Generation episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, is one of their better recent ideas.  Using the various bits of backstory accrued throughout 21 seasons of Next Gen, DS9 and Voyager, the contributing authors have shown various bits of this timeline through the eyes of important characters of the period.  On the whole, it has done so very successfully, too.  Most have been highly readable and very interesting.  It's a shame &quot;Deny Thy Father&quot; is neither.<br />On The Next Generation, Will Riker's past became a very interesting time for him.  Where originally he had a Kirk-like golden-boy past about him, over time he was shown to have overcome any number of moral issues to bring him to where he was then.  Among these issues were his drive to succeed and his alienation from his father.  Taking the span from the end of his second year at Starfleet Academy to his early weeks of his first posting on the U.S.S. Pegasus, Jeff Mariotte dives into some of these issues of Will Riker's - and his father's.<br />However, while he has his history down cold, he misses much of what made both characters (Will and his father) so dynamic.  Will comes off as shrill and immature while his father is equal parts coward and cold-hearted jerk.  Admittedly, these are all traits the characters strive to overcome, but in playing up these character flaws he loses the voice of the characters.<br />Also problematic is Starfleet Academy, where much of the action takes place.  Starfleet Academy has been problematic for writers throughout Star Trek's history, but few mangle it so badly as Mariotte.  While it is unlikely that Starfleet Academy would be much like modern West Point, also would it not be much like a modern high school - which is what it feels like.  The characters are caricatures, exemplifying the very traits Starfellt would not want, and the situations the characters are put in to are laughable.<br />It's a shame this book is not better, especially given the high standard set by the rest of the series.  Will Riker's past is a fascinating area begging for a good telling.  Unfortunately, this book does not provide that.  If you're working your way through the whole Lost Era series, go ahead and pick this one up, too, but I don't recommend it as stand-alone entertainment.	2003-12-02

I didn't finish Walter Shapiro's &quot;One-Car Caravan&quot; feeling that my vote in the 2004 Democratic Primary would go to a different candidate, but I did finish it feeling I had a better grasp of who each of the 'major' candidates were as people - and maybe feeling a little more comfortable in the thought of what would happen if any of the candidates that make me nervous get the nod.<br />Shapiro's book covers the five 'major' candidates of the 2004 Democratic Primary Election: Dean, Edwards, Gephardt, Lieberman and Kerry.  To a lesser extent it also tackles Bob Graham (who entered the race late and has since dropped out) and Al Sharpton, who gets his own chapter in Shapiro's examination of &quot;vanity candidates&quot; - candidates like Sharpton, Moseley-Braun and Kucinich who enter the race with apparently little hope for winning.  Absent from the book is Wesley Clark, who did not enter the race until the book was nearly published.  <br />Shapiro's book is based less on policy positions and public facades (although each get their due in the book) than on the candidates as people, and on the whole, each comes off well.  Shapiro's biases in the book are reasonably up-front: he identifies himself as a Democrat and he states his personal position as being closest to Howard Dean, and for the purposes of this book it works well.  Clearly stating his own stance allows him to deal relatively even-handedly with each of the candidates in turn, although its hard to shake the feeling that maybe he's a little harder on Howard Dean as a result initial Dean-leanings.<br />On the whole, it's not a deep, life-changing read, nor will it necessarily cause you to rethink your views on the 2004 Democratic candidates, but it is definitely worth reading.  Shapiro is careful in the time he gives each candidate, and at the end of the book you come away feeling like you know the candidates more intimately than you could ever from watching ad spots and debates.  It's a worthy goal for any political book, and Shapiro writes it well enough to keep you engaged through all 215 rather-quick pages.  If the 2004 Democratic hopefuls or the American political process interest you at all, I recommend giving it a shot.	2003-11-10

Having read numerous travelogues of Japan in the past few years, I began to despair that each one felt that it had a need to carve out a specific niche in the realm of travel writing on Japan.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does lead to increasingly stranger ideas for armchair travel.<br />As a result, I found it a nice touch that &quot;Japan Diaries&quot; is essentially a transcribed daily journal of two month-and-a-half to two-month trips taken to Japan across a ten-year stretch (1987 and 1997).  Without being condescending or offering &quot;the key&quot; to understanding Japan (as far too many Japan travelogues try to do), this book offers a very readable, very day-to-day view of visiting and living in Japan - especially when you come to the country with minimal first-hand experience with Japan itself.<br />However, if it doesn't offer an arrogant viewpoint it's also not the most insightful book on Japan, either.  Not that the author doesn't work hard to give a good background on the various things she talks about - and to be very clear to lay out her own biases in everything she talks about - but she also occasionally fails to understand what's going on around her, such as the background reasons for why foreigners find it so hard to rent an apartment in Japan.<br />On the whole, though, this is definitely light, interesting reading, perfect for a couple of days on the beach or a long airplane flight.  Sherman does as good a job as anyone else I've read of making you feel like you were taking the trip with her.  And when it comes down to it, isn't that what travel writing's really all about anyway?	2003-08-19

For my money, Robert Charles Wilson has written some of the most thought-out science fiction in the market today.  He is exceedingly good at taking a central idea, drawing you in, and then pulling the lens back to a much wider perspective that shows things being completely different than you'd expected - but that somehow manage to be logically consistent and equally as fascinating.  Even with that high standard, &quot;Blind Lake&quot; not only lives up to that ideal, but is possibly his best work to date.<br />The book deals with many themes that are familiar to readers of his other books.  Not just wildly different perspectives of a given story or concept, but also the ideas of divorce, gender, loss, being cut off from the outside world, and knowing that something just isn't right, but not knowing how to fix it.  These are all mixed together masterfully in a story of a mid-to-late 21st Century research complex of scientists whose complex is suddenly completely quarantined from the outside world for reasons that undoubtedly involve them, but seem to be completely unapparent.  While slowly ratcheting up the tension level throughout the story, he creates an amazing page-turning tension that had me up until 3:30 am working my way through it.<br />Beyond that, though, the story also deals with how we would try to understand aliens on their own terms if we could view them without having contact with them.  What types of classifications would we use?  What types of stories would we tell ourselves - or not allow ourselves to tell ourselves - about these beings?  As an anthropology student, I find these questions every bit as fascinating from an anthropological perspective as from a scientific perspective.  In fact, I'd even recommend this book to anthropologists as a study in how to perceive a people you share virtually no common link with.<br />Beyond all of that, though, this book is a great read.  If you've liked Wilson's other books, I can't imagine this one disappointing, and if you haven't, this is as good a place to start as any of his other books.  They're all stand-alone anyway.  I very much hope to see this book nominated for the Hugo Award in 2004...	2003-08-19
US	52673767	RXTQEUQJRMWJB	0380978598	19223003	Roma Eterna	Books	5	23	29	N	N	What It Would Have Taken For Rome To Not Fall...	Robert Silverberg's \\"Roma Eterna\\" is actually a collection of short stories he wrote between 1989 and 2003 detailing a Roman Empire that never fell.  While each story is a stand-alone tale within the alternate history of the world, taken together, they read much like another recent alternate history that details a radically different history of Euroe and Asia: Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"Years of Rice and Salt\\".<br />It becomes apparent very early in the book that Silverberg envisions not merely one but a chain of events as being necessary for Rome to not fall: a failed Jewish Exodus, Christianity never arising, a strong Emperor heading off the Third Century crisis, a definitive destruction of the Northern barbarians and Persia and an assassination of Mohammed before he could spread the word of Allah.  In the context of world history we as we know it, the chain is a pretty fragile one, but it does make for an interesting exercise in history - much like the entire book.  Some of his ideas have a very real ring of possibility to them: a Rome squandering the military might of a generation on an unsuccessful attempt at invading the Americas, Eastern and Western Empires that eventually fall on each other in a series of Civil Wars, a Rome grown fat and decadent on trade throughout the world that breeds emperors even more insane and bizarre than those known historically.  However, for each of these interesting and realistic twists, he allows himself more than a few historical parallels: the World Wars, Leonardo da Vinci, the French Revolution - and his modern Rome (of 1970) bears a great deal of resemblance to a modern Europe under a traditional Roman hegemony.<br />In all, though, I really liked this book, although I suspect it's not for everyone.  In fact, I would direct scholars or fans of Roman and Byzantine history towards it before I would the average sci-fi/fantasy/alternate history fan.  He knows his Roman history well, and he's not afraid to make obscure use of it.  Sometimes this makes for neat touches (like having the Eastern Empire fall to the West in 1453, the year the Eastern Empire in actuality fell to the Ottomans), and sometimes it just makes for a lot of names and dates.  The book is basically one great conceit to the 'what if' bundled inside an extensive history.  If that's your sort of thing (and it certainly is mine), you'll love it.  Otherwise, you may find youself rapidly bored or confused.	2003-06-27

Before writing this review, I should probably confess that the only other book in Bova's Solar System meta-series that I've read is \\"Jupiter\\", and I started \\"Saturn\\" immediately after finishing it.  I understand that \\"Jupiter\\" is one of the best books in the series, so my review might therefore be a little biased...<br />Anyhow, \\"Saturn\\" tells the story of a giant habitat full of scientists, 'liberals' and other free thinkers sent out to permanently study Saturn by the fundamentalist governments of Earth - with, of course, a few spies thrown in for good measure.  The trip takes two years and, in fact, also takes up three quarters of the book.  Along the way, Malcolm Eberly, the head of Human Resources on the ship, plots to take over the running of the station in a behind-the-scenes coup of social engineering.<br />Much of the story is told from his perspective and from that of his assistant Holly who very much highlight the evil, scheming fundamentalist/naive, good scientist dichotomy in the book.  It's not a dichotomy I have a problem with in theory, but much of the book reads like a great experiment in pseudoanthropology with Saturn used mainly as a backdrop.  Even the actual meat of character interaction comes off a little forced between many of the characters.  He does a convincing enough job having people with very large egos interact with each other, but once any human interaction gets past that, the book seems a little two-dimensional.<br />Once the action does switch to the planet itself (and I won't give away any of the major surprises), the payoff is surprisingly trite given the way \\"Jupiter\\" ended.  \\"Saturn\\"'s ending is also awfully abrupt by comparison - not that \\"Jupiter\\" took that long to wrap up.  Presumably Bova means for a sequel to follow this.  I hope so as there were major plot points left unfinished.<br />In all, it's an okay piece of science fiction, but it does stumble into a few potholes along the way - as well as making nearly pointless thetitle of the book.  If you're a huge fan of the series no doubt you'll go out and get this one, too.  If you're not, you're probably better off waiting for the paperback.	2003-05-28

Pocket Books, the literary rights-holders of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Universe, recently announced that they were drastically paring back the number of nonfiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; books that they would be publishing over the next few years.  I find this very unfortunate.  What I find even more unfortunate, though, is that the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager Companion&quot; is such a poor release that it may drive sales even lower and stop them from releasing any more nonfiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; for quite some time.  I really hope that's not the case, though; I've been hoping for an updated version of the &quot;Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot; or the &quot;Star Trek Chronology&quot; for a while...<br />Anyway, the Voyager Companion is a shockingly bad release given the wonderful nature of almost every nonfiction Star Trek book that has preceded it.  Almost devoid of behind-the-scenes info, it instead gives the types of pointless tallies (shuttlecraft lost, contacts made with the Alpha Quadrant, etc.) that you can find in almost any obsessive fan's website.  Given the high standards set by the Next Generation and DS9 Companions, it seems the author would, Paul Ruditis, would only have to copy the format to ensure success in this book.  Instead, he seems to want to drag us into the fictional Voyager world without explaining how the creative process for the series went.<br />Admittedly, that's not completely accurate, but it is very close.  A reprint of the writer's &quot;bible&quot; from the first year of the series - with its page and a half of commentary is a nice addition, and each season's chapter does have an opening section that talks a little about the changes the producers brought to the series every year.  There are also occaisonal text-boxes that highlight characters, races and aspects of the show, but the neat behind-the-scenes stuff has to share a lot of room with quotes taken from episodes.  What little actual commentary from the creative forces of the series exists is reduced to a very small fraction of what you got in the other two Companions.<br />All in all, I find it very, very hard to recommend this book.  I'd save my money for 2004's expected season box sets of Voyager instead.  Here's hoping, though, that one unfortunate nonfiction Star Trek book doesn't bring the entire line to a screeching halt.	2003-05-16

It revisits ground from \\"Lords and Ladies\\" and \\"Carpe Jugulum\\", which is fine, because with usual Pratchett flair, he tosses in enough wry satire, strange humor and generally good storytelling that you don't always notice when he goes back to some of his older material.<br />While the Nac Mac Feegle (the Wee Free Men last seen in \\"Carpe Jugulum\\"), little woad-tattooed Pictsies, do feature in a large chunk of the book, the heroine is Tiffany, a nine-year-old witch's granddaughter and budding witch herself who must be the singularly most sensible (but still likeable) character I've ever read in a book directed at an audience less than 18 years old.  She struggles to cope with the death of a grandmother who, even though she died more than a year ago, has still had a huge impact on her life.  She also struggles with making sense of the world - both as a young girl and as a human being, and she struggles with the Queen of the Elves/Fairies (last seen in \\"Lords and Ladies\\") in what becomes a metaphor for maturity and clarity in a large, scary world.  Pratchett's moral is that just because you're not yet officially an adult, it doesn't mean that you can't understand the world any less well.  This is a theme he's played with before, but it's always appropriate no matter how many times he brings it out.<br />As a huge Discworld fan, I really enjoyed this book - possibly even more than \\"The Amazing Maurice...\\", although it's probably not at quite the same level of literary excellence as his previous work.  Fans of Pratchett in general will undoubtedly appreciate his jabs at academia, fairy tales and the Harry Potter series (which future books about Tiffany may someday parody more explicitly).  For fans of Discworld, not only are Tiffany and theNac Mac Feegle two of his more interesting creations (which is saying something), but the cameo by Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg at the end is delightful.  Missing, though, is the obligatory cameo by Death - possibly for the first time ever in a Discworld book.<br />Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone regardless of age or knowledge of Discworld.  As with \\"The Amazing Maurice...\\" the Discworld cosmology is relatively light, so if you're not familiar with the Disc, it won't get in the way of enjoying the book.  If you are, though, his subtle touches and revisitations throughout the book make it a more integrated work than his last foray into Discworld-Young-Adult.  Either way, though, it's a great book.	2003-05-04

Harry Turtledove's \\"Darkness\\" series - originally supposed to be a four-book series - is now in its fifth book.  However, given that there's less than a year's worth of World-War-II-as-Fantasy left to tell, he probably will not suffer much further from Robert Jordan's Syndrome...<br />This book takes us through most of 1944, from the aftermath of the massive tank battle at Kursk (Durrwangen in the series) and the retaking of the Ukraine (Grelz) by the Soviets (Unkerlanters), through a possible late version of Guadalcanal or an early version of Iwo Jima (on Becehsely), the Warsaw (Eoforwic) Uprising, Omaha Beach and the liberation of Paris (Balvi), the crumbling of [German] forces in Belgium and the Netherlands (the withdrawal from Valmiera) to the Soviet armistice with Finland (Zuwayzi) and the flip-flop of Romania & Bulgaria (Yanina - which to this point in the series had been playing the role of Italy).<br />As before, the majority of Turtledove's attention goes to the Soviet-[German] (Unkerlanter-Algarvian) conflict with Western Europe playing a smaller role and the Pacific War (save the Manhattan Project) being given only casual attention.  While Turtledove certainly deserves credit for bringing the half of the European War attention that we in America so often fail to give it, it would have been nice to see him give the Pacific War its due as well.  As always, he highlights the evils of war in general and how it affects the footsoldier and the villager every bit as much as the general and the minister.  His characters are reasonably three-dimensional in terms of their perspectives even if he never lets you forget the \\"funny hats\\" - identifying characteristics - of the characters (possibly a necessity given the size of the cast of characters he has to work with here).<br />As with his other \\"Darkness\\" novels, I enjoyed this one.  I do hope he wraps up the story in the next book, though (which has been tentatively titled \\"Out of the Darkness\\" for some time now and will probably see the light of day in 2004).  Harry Turtledove's series are always interesting and I'm glad to have read them, but it would be nice to actually see him find an ending for at least one of his series at some point.	2003-04-27

Before I get started on the meat of the review, I have a quick warning for anyone who might be thinking of starting the series here: don't.  Go back and pick up &quot;Eye of the World&quot; and work your way forward.  By Book 10, Robert Jordan expects his readers to be familiar with the story and spends minimal time catching people up - even those that may not have read &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; recently.<br />The later books of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series seem to be devolving into a sort of Xeno's Paradox - the closer the series gets to the final battle, the closer Tarmon Gai'don seems, but we never seem to close more than half the remaining distance in any one book.  In fact, with this book, we seem to close very little distance at all.  The name, &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;, implies that major decisions are made in this book that will affect the course of the series.  In fact, major decisions are made - by Mat, by Perrin, by Egwene, by Rand, by Elaida, by Tuon and a few others.  Unfortunately, though, the book ends before we see much action that results from any of these decisions.<br />Most of the main characters are present for this installment, breaking a pattern established in the last few books where one of the major characters is left out - or all but left out - of each book.  Nynaeve may be the one exception here (she has a brief, nonspeaking scene), but Rand has minimal time in this book as well.  He doesn't appear until page 540 (out of 680) and his arc is left to two chapters and the epilogue.  In fact, the climactic events of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; are pushed off to the side for pretty much the entire story.  Instead, the focus is primarily on Perrin, Mat and Egwene.  Each of them reaches one (or more) crucial decisions that seem to be on the cusp of being borne out at the beginning of the next novel.<br />Then again, we thought that to be the case books ago.<br />If you're a &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; junkie like me, I hardly needto encourage you to get this installment - just be warned that it seems almost a prologue in-and-of itself for the remainder of the series.  Also, be warned that you might want to read over &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; again to refamiliarize yourselves with many of the minor characters - especially the Aes Sedai.  More are introduced with each book and I, for one, am starting to find it very hard to keep more than eight or ten of them straight.  A quick rundown on each in the glossary really wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Nonetheless, this book is solid Robert Jordan and in spite of the lack of movement, I was still happy to get my (now every three-year) &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; fix.  If you're as big a fan as I am, go pick it up.  If you're a little less so, you may want to wait until the paperback comes out.  It'll help minimize the time (and possibly disappointment) until Book 11 comes out.	2003-01-07

Reviews I've read of &quot;Shopgirl&quot; so far call it everything from a latter-day Jane Austin novel(la) to an incredible book of self-discovery.  I wish I could say quite as many nice things about it as so many others have, but I'm afraid much of the book fell short of its hype for me.<br />The story is a fairly simple one, and, in fact, it only takes a hundred and thirty pages to tell.  It's the story of Mirabelle, a depressive Neiman's clerk and part-time starving artist, her slacker almost-boyfriend Jeremy and her May-December romance with a fifty-something millionaire.  It follows her life as she stumbles from revelation to depression to just plain ennui in a narrative style that I can't make up my mind about.   As an ever-shifting present, the narrative style seems to reflect the characters' ennui half the time and seem like a bad freshman English composition the other half.  While I appreciate Steve Martin's efforts at keeping the style consistent with the moods of the characters (almost always down), I feel like I have to stop myself from grading his work.<br />The book takes place mostly in L.A., and for some of the book, reads like an anti-&quot;L.A. Story&quot;, with people who live in a place the rest of us see as semi-surreal, but unlike the persistent (and possibly medically-induced) happiness of &quot;L.A. Story&quot;, the characters here live in a perpetual funk.  Furthermore, the narrator's viewpoint is such that the characters themselves are (almost) always laid bare, but the humor - most of it dark - has to be wanted to be found.  Otherwise, you find yourself floating along in the same cheerless state as the characters.<br />None of this makes for a necessarily bad novel, though, and, in fact, makes for quite the observant satire on L.A. life.  If I have one main complaint for the book, though, it's Martin's use of supporting characters.  In particular, Mirabelle's father and her co-worker (and unknown nemesis) Lisa are given interesting stories that are never resolved.  They're simply forgotten when the main love triangle is patched up.<br />On the whole, I find this a book not devoid of merit, but I would have liked a little more humor to balance the ever-present unhappiness the book seems dangerously close to drowning in sometimes.  Likewise, I would have liked to see him experiment a little more with the narrative style.  I can appreciate what he was doing, but, with me, it never quite worked.  If you're a fan of Steve Martin's other work, you may like this as well - it has a tang of personal intensity that almost makes you wonder if it's inspired by real life.  Just be warned that it may not be as comedic as you've come to expect from him.	2002-12-30

While \\"Voyage of the Shadowmoon\\" is a switch to fantasy for Sean McMullen, a lot of his style from the \\"Greatwinter\\" Trilogy carries over to this book.  His sense of epic remains unchanged - the end of the book is far, far away (both geographically and plotwise) from the beginning.  His plot twists can sneak up on you - unlike some authors (notably Robert Jordan) plot developments surprise you without a lot of narrative foreboding.  He continues his passion for unstable academics - the learned in his world frequently have more depth (and insanity) than any of his other characters.  Perhaps most importantly, though, his sense of humor remains unchanged - it can be slippery at times, but he's just as comfortable in the dry and sardonic as he is in the silly.  Oh, and he still has a taste for strange romances.<br />\\"Voyage of the Shadowmoon\\" follows a circle of world leaders, spies, priest-academics and a vampyre in the ultimate chase for the ultimate doomsday weapon.  As with his \\"Greatwinter\\" series, he's quite content to begin with Earth-shattering events (almost literally) and then explore what people will really do in the face - or the lure - of unstoppable power.  In that, this book works equally well as political allegory (nuclear winter, anyone?) and epic fantasy.  His chases are gripping, his ability to think through a given situation thoroughly impressive, and his sense of timing truly offbeat, which makes this - for my money - the most original fantasy novel since George R. R. Martin's \\"A Clash of Kings\\".<br />I really can't praise this novel enough - even the characters are thoroughly memorable - especially the chivalric vampyre Laron, who after seven hundred years of otherworldly exile has little left to hold on to beyond his chivalric code and a morbid sense of humor.  His world is very well realized and plays out with threads and references taken from across two thousand years of human literature.  If you liked the \\"Greatwinter\\" series, this one is everybit as good - and has at least some potential to continue as a series (although it could easily be left as a standalone novel as well).  If you're looking for something to tide you over until the next Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind or George R. R. Martin novel comes out, this is an excellent place to look.  Even if you're just a fan of political or historical fiction, it still works.  Give it a shot.	2002-12-10

The mid-Fourth Century Emperor Julian is definitely one of the more fascinating characters in the later Roman Empire.  In a time of growing Christianity and crumbling power, Julian was a strong leader and a devout Hellenistic Pagan.  He brought decisive victories against the barbarians invading Gaul (modern-day France) and the Persians - the eternal thorn in the side of Rome, but died in a catastrophic overshooting of his resources in the midst of attacking the Persians at the heart of their Empire.<br />Ford's treatment of Julian and the times in which he lived is both strong and disappointing at the same time.  The sense of military tension and the increasing Orientalism of the Imperial Court come through strongly, and Julian's campaigns in Gaul and Persia are well-researched.  Nonetheless, there's a very \\"Middle Ages\\" sense to the Christian church of timelessness and doctrine - when it should be in the midst of faction purges and self-definition - as well as a close-knit feel of Roman politics that never existed.<br />Admittedly, there's little reason to make \\"Gods and Legions\\" another \\"I, Claudius\\", but the political life of the novel is boiled down to half a dozen or so memorable characters.  To write a novel about the Roman Empire that glosses over politics is like writing a novel of Eighteenth Century America that glosses over the British.<br />It's obvious from his postscript that Ford has done his research - he's thoroughly combed the best sources of the times including Julian's own writings for the sense of power and contradiction that the man's legacy carries even today. However, the contradictions he focuses on loan themselves more to Julian's character than his history.  He uses Ammianus Marcellinus (a fourth-century solider who wrote a great deal about Julian from a first-hand perspective) very hazardously, practically quoting directly at some points and totally ignoring him when he wants to give Julian a more mystical, fantastic presence (which can besomewhat odd considering that Ammianus was one of his chief supporters in the historical record).<br />In all, Ford's book makes for a decent novel and a decent military grounding in Julian's accomplishments, but fails in numerous accounts to give as accurate an impression of the time as Ford would have you believe.  If you have a casual interest in Roman history, it's a decent way to kill a plane ride, but I'd caution the serious student to take this book with a grain of salt.	2002-12-02

While Terry Pratchett is always funny - and one of the wittiest writers in fantasy (if not all of publishing) - many of his last ten books seem a little short of the sparkle that his earlier work had.  This is certainly not a problem for \\"Night Watch\\", though.  In fact, it's his very return to many of his old formulas that, surprisingly, makes it such a success.<br />As with all the Discworld books, \\"Night Watch\\" takes three or four popular themes in literature - or fiction or science fiction or whatever - and plays with them and their conventions.  For this book, he's taken the idea of everybody's reminiscences of the 'good old days', time travel stories (especially those like \\"Back to the Future\\") and revolutions (specifically the French Revolution and at least a couple of Roman revolutions I can think of).  All of this is, of course, woven into the story of Sam Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, being thrown back in time thirty years to a pivotal revolution in the city when he was just starting as a recruit.<br />All the stereotypes are there: from the dingy, cowardly watchmen that he must whip into shape to the know-it-all monitoring wise people (monks, in this case) and the young versions of many of the other Ankh-Morpork denizens we've met in the past five Watch books.  What really makes this great, though, is that he has fun with all of these stereotypes and still manages to tell a story that's both engaging and like going back to visit old friends (albeit cowardly, somewhat-corrupt ones).<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to the Terry Pratchett fan as well as to the fantasy fan or even just the humor fan.  While going back to \\"Guards! Guards!\\" (the first Discworld book about the Watch) may be helpful for those of you that aren't familiar with the series, it's still strong enough that it can hold it's own.  If \\"Night Watch\\" is your first Terry Pratchett book, you may miss a lot of the references, but you'll still be in for an excellent read.	2002-11-05

One thing I will say for David Weber is that he certainly has no compunctions about throwing the reader in in the middle of his main character's career.  In the process of reading \\"On Basilisk Station\\" I had to go back and check two or three times to make sure that this wasn't the third or fourth book in the series.  Not that this is a bad thing - he gives us a character in this book that is fully realized and has a well fleshed-out past.  It also leads to many pages of plot exposition, but I'd rather have more characterization in most cases than less.<br />\\"On Basilisk Station\\" is the beginning of his \\"Honor Harrington\\" series and it owes a big debt to Imperial Britain for virtually every aspect of the main character's navy (and universe) - with the exception, of course, of technology.  Using some rather tried-and-true aspects of military writing - the surly, resentful crew, the mission of exile and the evil empire next door, Weber creates a very readable universe with characters that are, while not exactly inspired, certainly fun to read about.<br />If I have any one complaint about the book, it's that he loves his characters so much, he's afraid to really get in a torture them on a psychological level - unlike writers like George R.R. Martin or Lois McMaster Bujold - but he certainly knows how to write good space battles and that makes up for a lot.  This book makes for great summer or diversionary reading. but it misses greatness by a hair.  Nonetheless, I'm definitely pushing on to book two, \\"The Honor of the Queen\\" and I encourage anyone looking for good, old-fashioned Imperial-style science fiction to give this a go.  It's a lot of fun.	2002-10-12

Most books dealing with the spread of American pop culture (and pop business) influences these days like Disney, Coca-Cola and McDonald's have very little good to say about the growth of any of them in previously unexposed markets.  That's why, perhaps, it comes as surprising that \\"Golden Arches East\\" comes out with a mostly positive look at the effect McDonald's had had throughout East Asia.<br />In this book, five authors look at the impact McDonald's has had in five different East Asian entities: China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.  Much of the early chapters is given over to looking at the material aspects of McDonald's in East Asia: the marketing aspects, the reconceptualization towards a standard Asian consumer, the effect on the Asian food industry, etc..  All of this makes for very fascinating reading and shows just how marketing has to be changed from country to country (or even region to region).  Likewise, it deals with very nuts-and-bolts issues of how McDonald's has impacted the lives of the average Asian consumer - and the impact is bigger than you'd think.<br />However, later chapters (especially those dealing with Taiwan and Korea and the Afterword) move to more conceptual issues of McDonald's - issues of modernity. Americanization and cultural identity.  In an anthropological context (which is what this book tries to maintain), these are all very important, but somehow the later efforts seem to either fall flat or fall back on the line used so often in studying Asia these days, \\"But things are changing now\\".<br />While the overall message of this book is positive, there are the standard overtones of just how much the world has changed in the past half-century.  I really recommend this book for the nuts-and-bolts stuff in the first two or three chapters, but the later didacticism tends to fall a little flat.  Nonetheless, this book offers useful information to both the business student and the cultural anthropologist.  If either East Asia or McDonald's interest you, I recommend giving this book a shot.	2002-10-12
US	52673767	R2GBR3KV7I7YHB	0674768949	427709144	Riding the Black Ship: Japan and Tokyo Disneyland (Harvard East Asian Monographs)	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Co-Opting Disney...	Like McDonald's, Coca-Cola and they other highly visible aspects of American culture, Disney has long been taken to be one of America's many types of &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; - a part of American culture forced on the rest of the world whether they like it or not that quickly gets absorbed like candy by most other countries.  In &quot;Riding the Black Ship&quot;, Aviad Raz makes a very compelling case for how Japan, in fact, reworks Disney to fit its own image in a very non-traditional way.<br />Drawing on visits to Tokyo Disneyland, interviews with current and former employees and comparisons with the American Disney parks and Japan's other theme parks, he looks at how Disney is presented, not only to Japan, but to the park's employees and to the country itself.  He represents this as three aspects: &quot;on-stage&quot;, &quot;backstage&quot; and &quot;off-stage&quot;.  He takes us through how employees are trained, how rides are conceptualized and how the people of Japan see the park - among other things.<br />From this he boils down his argument to essentially say that, while the illusion of being &quot;just like America&quot; is preserved at great lengths, Tokyo Disneyland subtly alters just about every aspect of the park to appeal to a more Japanese audience.  More interestingly, this is mostly done by the Japanese management and can be used to show how Japan deals not only with cultural influences, but with the entire world.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in cultural anthropology, Japanese business practice or just a curiosity about Disney.  In anthropology, arguments and perspectives like these are being used with greater frequency, but rarely are they exhibited as well as in Raz's book.  It's very readable and it makes some fascinating - and important - arguments about how Japan sees and deals with the world today.	2002-09-30
US	52673767	R2UDNQ8PYV5DE4	1930846118	475425031	Black Projects, White Knights: The Company Dossiers	Books	5	45	45	N	N	Layers and Crevices...	I've been following Kage Baker's \\"Company\\" series of novels for a few years now, but it was only with the publication of this book that I discovered just how many \\"Company\\" short stories she has written as well.  According to her own notes, she has written more than twenty.  Fifteen of them are showcased here.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with this series, it tracks the lives of a number of immortal cyborgs working for a company from the twenty-fourth century that has found the solutions to both immortality and time travel and uses them to send agents through time to collect bits of history.  The catch to this, though, is that recorded history cannot be changed, so the operatives must work in the shadows of history - collecting artifacts after ships are sunk, graves are sealed, etc.  This introductory story is actually an excellent introduction to the plot and the dramatis personae of the series.<br />For those of you that are familiar with the \\"Company\\" series, the fifteen short stories in here cover most major characters we've seen so far - including Joseph, Lewis, Mendoza and her very mysterious lover - and manages to dig around in their stories enough to shed greater illumination on all the characters without making the collection necessary reading for those that are sticking only to the novels.  It also details the childhood of Alec Checkerfield, a young mortal from the mid-24th Century who is undoubtedly another aspect of Nicholas/Edward, in four separate stories.  Each is excellent, if slightly surreal, but they serve to raise more questions than they answer about him.  Incidentally, for those of you curious, the breakdown for how often each character is featured in the collection is: 3 for Joseph, 3 for Mendoza (one featuring both of them), 1 for Lewis, 4 for Alec, 2 for Kalugin, 1 about Budu, 1 indeterminate and 1 introductory story telling a little about all the characters but not featuring any of them.<br />Each of these stories is a gem and I reallylike how they flesh out the \\"Company\\" universe more fully.  If I have one complaint, it is that I wish more of her stories would feature places other than California or Britain and she'd get out and play around with other parts of the world more.  However, this is minor given the level of detail that she knows about both.  This is 'must-read' material for the established Kage Baker fan and a not-half-bad starting spot for the novice - although you may want to pick up \\"In The Garden of Iden\\" first if you're really curious.	2002-09-14

Bean's nemesis from the first two \\"Shadow\\" novels is almost absent from the book - putting in only three small appearances in the text.  However, his presence falls over every other characters' thoughts and actions to the point of paranoia.<br />Beginning with a raid by Peter Wiggin, the new Hegemon, to remove him from his Chinese custodians, Achilles finds himself as the new Assistant to the Hegemon, an action that immediately alienates virtually everyone - including Bean and Petra - from Peter.  From there, we follow even more of the Battle School kids from \\"Ender's Game\\" through a world that is becoming more paranoid, more frightened and more ready to fall apart - all while Peter's access to what few resources he has as Hegemon are being systematically stripped away by a man he thought he could use to his advantage.<br />\\"Shadow Puppets\\" focuses on even more of the other supporting characters of \\"Ender's Game\\" - Alai, Han Tzu (Hot Soup), and Virlomi - and brings the Middle East into the mix of Asian politics that Card set up in \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\".  The Battle Schoolers have evolved from pawns in the previous books to major figures in their respective countries and will undoubtedly be the ones, in his final \\"Shadow\\" book, that run the world once it is united by the someday-great Hegemon Peter Wiggin.<br />Bean and Petra are, of course, also of major focus in the book and their relationship hits a critical point as Bean tries to come to terms with his impending mortality.  Both characters begin to accept their humanity more which, of course, raises the stakes against Achilles.  Likewise, the memory of Ender (who is, of course, headed off to the colonies) colors everyone's pereceptions and actions, almost much as Achilles' actions do.<br />If I had any one fault with the book, it is that it feels a little 'fit in' between \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" and the final book, which is yet to be written.  Some of the hurdles the characters must jump through feel a little forced and Achilles has definitely passed his prime as a villian, but these are minor quibbles.  \\"Shadow Puppets\\" is definitely a solid novel that continues to juggle humanity, politics and personal natures quite well.  Card is continuing to show that he can work with shades of gray in characters that are doing their best for the common good.  If you've read the other two novels in Card's \\"Shadow\\" series, there's no reason to stop now.  If not, go back and pick up \\"Ender's Game\\" or \\"Ender's Shadow\\" - or both.	2002-08-19

When I first picked up \\"Worlds That Weren't\\", I was expecting an alternate-history version of \\"Legends\\", the 1998 fantasy anthology in which prominent fantasy authors wrote novellas based in worlds that they were best known for in the fantasy genre.  My guess was partly right.<br />Two of the stories - S.M. Stirling's \\"Shikari in Galveston\\" and Mary Gentle's \\"The Logistics of Carthage\\" do in fact take place in universes the authors have previously explored.  Each about a generation before the main action of the novels (or series), Stirling's story revolves around the father of Athelstane King (the hero of \\"The Peshawar Lancers\\") and Mary Gentle's deals with the 'parents' of Ash from \\"Ash: A Secret History\\".<br />The other two, though, seem to be independent works.  Harry Turtledove's explores what would've happened had Socrates gone with Alcibiades to Syracuse (in Sicily) and if Alcibiades would not have fled following his summons back to Athens during the Peloponnesian War.  Without giving too much away, he reenvisions Alcibiades as a possibly less-successful Alexander the Great a full 80 years before Alexander's time.  Walter Jon Williams, on the other hand, takes a look at a Tombstone, Arizona to which Friedrich Nietzche had been medically exiled.  He had Nietzche (sort-of) joining the Clantons against the Earps at the famous O.K. Corral shoot-out and creates a much different legacy for the Old West.<br />All four novels are well done and each author knows his or her territory well (and, more importantly, provides details about the real-world events in their respective afterwords), but some succeed better than others.  Turtledove has problems resisting the temptation of having characters dwell on alternate fates (i.e., events as they actually happened).  Stirling's Neobritish Empire has all the hallmarks of good action on a broad, fascinating canvas, but ends up reading more like a James Bond story than as alternate history.  Even his afterword comes out much that way where he talks about the creative process more than the dynamics of his world (much of which, admittedly, you can get in the appendices of \\"The Peshawar Lancers\\").  Gentle's and Williams' works seem to fair better, but I am much less familiar with their work than with Turtledove's and Stirling's.<br />On the whole, though, all four stories are very well done.  The book represents a couple of days worth of diverting, fun reading and it's not always necessary to be familiar with the authors' worlds (or the history involved) to enjoy the stories.  Nonetheless, though, for people reading the books for their historical merit, you may wish to read the afterwords before the stories to refresh the given histories.  Most of them do not give away the stories turn out (Turtledove's being a partial exception).  I would still like to see a \\"Legends\\"-line anthology of alternate history stories, but, in the mean time, this will hold me over.	2002-07-12

In looking for something to read during a rather stressful finals week, I took the recommendation of a friend and picked up Bryson's &quot;In A Sunburned Country&quot;.  Not only did it turn out to be a wonderfully light read, but it filled me so full of legitimately interesting Australia trivia that I'm torn between wanting to go there and trying to find my way onto an all-Australia version of Jeopardy.<br />Bryson does an impressive job of detailing the entire country through a series of four trips between 1997 and 2000 that cover all the Australian states and provinces except Tasmania.  In the process he visits everything from the famous (including events like the 200 Sydney Olympics) to the incredibly obscure and gives more than equal weight to the biological curiosities of the island (which go much further than simply marsupials and the Great Barrier Reef).  Through this he has done extensive historical research and takes us through such bizarre events as Harold Holt, the Prime Minister in 1967 who dived into the surf one day on vacation and was never seen again.  In his honor, the people of Canberra (the capital) named the municipal swimming pool after him.  He discusses how Aum Shinrikyo (the cult behind the Sarin Tokyo gas attack) may or may not have set off the world's first nongovernmental nuclear explosion in a desolate corner of the Outback - for some reason, it's never been investigated.  He takes an in-depth look at Australian cricket matches and the general bizarreness of Australian politics.  Even with all of this wonderfully witty Australian history and the numerous biology lessons, he still finds time to visit every major city on the continent.<br />If there are any flaws to be found in his book, it is perhaps in the way he leaves his discussions of the Aborigines hanging as he ends it.  He spends a fair amount of time discussing the intense difficulties in Caucasian-Aboriginal relations over the last two hundred years and finds much to be unhappyabout.  He takes a serious (if brief) look at the cultural prejudice inherent even today in the Australian culture, but he ultimately ends with shaking his head and noting that he doesn't see an answer either.  While glad to see the subject addressed, I found the scope of his discussion disappointing.  Admittedly, a travelogue may not necessarily be the best place for this discussion, but to get so far into the discussion and then abandon it seemed unfortunate.<br />Nonetheless, this doesn't interfere with my enthusiasm for the book as a whole and I am at least glad to see the topic tackled somewhat substantively.  This book is simply wonderful from cover to cover.  It makes great summer reading, great waiting-room reading, great reading for when you're stressed out or just plain great reading period.  Having read this one, I'm now going to have to take a look at his other works.  I may have to take a look at visiting Australia sometime, too...	2002-07-07

Finishing up the three-book Janus Gate series (and still without an accurate back-cover description), &quot;Past Prologue&quot; winds up the numerous temporal paradoxes for the crew and sets the stage for Pocket Books' relaunch of their Original Series novel line.<br />Building on the events of &quot;Present Tense&quot; and &quot;Future Imperfect&quot;, &quot;Past Prologue&quot; follows Kirk's trip into his past as he comes to terms with a life-threatening embassy visit his family made when he was 14.  Kirk and his father must hunt for his younger self (not knowing he's been thrown to Captain Kirk's present) through a city on the verge of civil war and in the midst of a Federation withdrawal.  Back on the Enterprise, both Sulus, both Chekovs (alternate future and present), Spock, Uhura and the 14-year old Kirk must find a way of reactivating the Janus Gate's time-travel capability without alerting the race who has come to seal it off.<br />The novel moves more quickly than it's predecessors, but it does so at the expense of some interesting character development.  Both sets of the Sulu/Chekov duo work well together on paper, but any effective scenes between older and younger counterparts are brushed aside.  Likewise, Kirk's efforts in the past with his father open some rather large dramatic questions that never get adequately answered.<br />Ultimately, the pacing and style of the book overcome much of that, but the oddly unsatisfying ending wrecks much of what Graf has built throughout three novels.  Without giving it away, the ending comes off as unsatisfying and repetitive of previous Trek works (without having the interesting spin that went with many of the recycled ideas up until there).  If you've come this far, you might as well finish the series - it's certainly not a complete waste of time to do so - but it certainly doesn't live up to what Graf built in Books One and Two.	2002-07-03

Picking up where \\"The Depths of Time\\" left off, \\"The Ocean of Years\\" forms the second part of Allen's \\"Chronicles of Solace\\" and sends Admiral Koffield and the crew of the Dom Pedro IV hurrying back to the Solar System to find word of Oskar deSilvo's whereabouts.<br />Allen's universe here revolves around an Earth and its colonies linked together by a series of timeshaft wormholes: that is, a series of fixed-distance wormholes through time that allow ships (none of which are capable of faster-than-light travel) to objectively experience a hundred-plus year trip through time in a subjective period of days or weeks.  The concept is a bit complex (requiring a chart and full-page explanation at the start of each book), but comes off as oddly plausible once you think through the myriad implications of the system - which Allen seems to do well.<br />In this trilogy, outer terraformed colonies are beginning to die and the only answers as to why are linked with their terraformer - Oskar deSilvo.  A man thought dead halfway through the first book, he is hiding in an undisclosed location having provided, essentially, a maze for the crew of the Dom Pedro IV to run to find him.  Taking them the libraries orbiting Neptune to Earth to the long-ruined, fungally-overgrown Mars, the book is essentially a series of mysteries laid out and solved by the crew in their attempt to not only find out where deSilvo is, but what implications his pre-hibernation discoveries have for the worlds colonized by Earth.  <br />While this book makes an excellent middle chapter in the trilogy - building on the first one and naturally extrapolating much higher stakes for the third, it does suffer from a few small problems.  One is that it's virtually impossible to understand if you haven't read \\"The Depths of Time\\".  While he tries to being new readers up to speed, he does so over the first hundred or so pages of the book, creating a bit of a jumble in terms of the action occurring.  I found even havingread the first book six or nine months ago, I was getting lost having forgotten many of the main details.  Likewise, his pacing occasionally suffers from unpredictable stutters.  Stylistically, it lags or surges forward at odd times.  There were parts in the middle - and near the end that dragged by as you waited for characters to move on to the next key.  In the same way, occasional pieces of the puzzle were laid out only to be immediately solved by the characters - not giving the reader a chance to try to stay one jump ahead of the mystery.<br />Nonetheless, though, this is still an outstanding book.  His universe is based on a novel idea and is well extrapolated from that point.  The shadowy, background villains stay suitably shadowy and a good sense of paranoia slowly infuses the book.  If you read - and enjoyed - \\"The Depths of Time\\", definitely give this one ago (after having, perhaps, flipped through the first again).  If not, go back and pick up \\"The Depths of Time\\"; it's worth the read.	2002-06-26
US	52673767	R3DK2CV1VHOMTE	0415195748	724729155	An Anthropologist in Japan: Glimpses of Life in the Field (ASA Research Methods Series)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Part Travelogue, Part Case Study...	As Hendry points out in the afterword, it is becoming more and more common in anthropology today to ground your observations and anecdotes in personal experience to give the reader the ability to judge your work based on your deductions.  This, however, is the first time that I have seen an anthropologist turn his or her work into what is essentially a &quot;My Year in Japan&quot; book.  Previously mainly the realm of travel writers and JET participants, her work shows her year - and her methodology - through the eyes of someone formally trained to observe Japan.<br />As an exercise is research methods, this makes for a fascinating book.  As an anthropology student studying Japan, I find it fascinating to study other people's approaches to the same thing.  As a future researcher, I found the back-door into her creative process and her perspective on Japan to have interesting similarities and differences to mine.  As someone with a continual curiosity about Japan, I found her observations on politeness and wrapping in Japanese society to have interesting and far-reaching implications for the way Westerners view Japan.<br />However, while her actual work on politeness and wrapping in Japanese society becomes something that she discusses researching and discovering, she never presents her finalized work.  It would have been nice to see an article or two produced from her research added as an appendix to give the anthropologists reading the book a sense of how her creative process was synthesized into a final product.<br />This means that ultimately, I have to look at the book as a travelogue, too, since she seems to be casting a net for a wider audience here.  In this, it comes up as well researched, but a little wanting as well.  It is clear that her time in Japan is well spent, but she never dives into anything completely.  In most cases, it is because her reason for being there is her research, and that is what gets her primary focus.  However, she never seems to fully jump into her research for fear of losing the nonacademic reader.  Even a little more frustrating from both points of view is that she frequently foreshadows important points in the beginning of the book (her eventual meetings with local temple priests and yakuza, for instance), while ultimately rushing through the encounters at the end of the book.<br />In the end, this book is left fishing for an audience.  It seems to ultimately be most useful for the person studying methodology or the creative process.  It is still a fascinating book - Hendry's extrapolation of the verbal and physical wrapping of Japanese culture is a point that should be discussed in greater depth by anthropologists today.  Likewise, her narrative, if occasionally frustrating, is certainly enjoyable and comes from an apparently unique travelogue perspective.  I would certainly recommend it unreservedly to the student studying Japan or anthropology.  I might be a little more reticent on recommending it to the travel reader, though.	2002-06-22

Oddly enough, though, not once does the action of the story take place aboard the Enterprise.<br />Picking up from the cliffhanger in the first first book, Lieutenant Sulu of the Enterprise finds himself swapped in time with an older version of himself that is struggling to hold on in a Federation almost overrun by the Gorn.  Likewise, Captain Kirk has been swapped with his teenage self.  While we do not see the time Captain Kirk has been sent to, we see a how the crew reacts to having a teenage version of their respected captain stuck with them.<br />While the ideas are again not new: time-travelling technology from an ancient culture, a future in peril and balancing the needs of now against the needs of the future, the way in which L.A. Graf spins them are quite fun.  Again, she's created a meat-and-potatoes &quot;Star Trek&quot; story that reads like a well-done episode (and a preview of the crew's five-year mission).  She gets the interplay between Sulu, Chekov and Uhura down well and the book definitely stands on those three, relegating Kirk, Spock and McCoy to the periphery.  She even manages to throw in an unexpected twist or two while tying the story together (in its back-and-forth-through-time aspect) quite well.<br />Her future timeline (one in which Kirk never commanded the Enterprse) is reasonably well thought out as well.  She constructs an entire future timeline and does a good job of showing what Chekov and Sulu could reasonably have become given those circumstances.<br />Again, it's not Shakespeare (or even &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;), but it really doesn't have to be.  It's a fun, light read and should be taken as such.  If you're a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan - or even a general sci-fi fan looking for something not too strenuous to take to the beach or the park, you could do worse than this.	2002-06-17

While I was an avid &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel reader in junior high and high school, I've found that in the last seven or eight years, I've really drifted away from &quot;Star Trek&quot; in any nontelevised form.  Once a year or so, I may pick up a novel that has a relatively interesting premise, but I find myself more often than not disappointed these days.  Anyway, I picked up &quot;Present Tense&quot; needing something to tide me over in Honolulu until my furniture (and books) arrived from the mainland and found that it was, to my surprise, pretty decent.<br />L.A. Graf's work has often been a cut about many of her &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer-colleagues'.  This one proves no exception.  While the plot isn't necessarily anything new - something's draining power from the ship and people are trapped on a planet below - she writes with enough heart and interest in the characters that it reads like a good, old-fashioned &quot;Star Trek&quot; plot.  When you throw into the mix a brand-new Ensign Pavel Chekov, perspectives from oft-ignored Uhura and Sulu, an attention to detail surrounding the events of &quot;The Naked Time&quot; - which chronologically just precedes this, and a certain amount of creepy cave-crawling, you get a fun, if light, story.<br />Being the first book of a three-book series, there's a lot of set-up here, but it does a good job of laying out mysteries that have a certain amount of thought to them - and can't be answered immediately.  While it does, eventually, become a time-travel/alternate history story, it works fine as a mystery/adventure first.  Even the set-up for the time-travel stuff is good, though, as Graf lays it out in little chunks rather than dropping it all at the end.<br />My only real regret about the book is that, as a serial, it's the first of three books to buy.  Pocket Books, the publishers of &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels, occaisionally release three-book sets, all penned by one author with two books released one month and one the next.  Why they don't release it all as one trade paperback that costs the same as three mass-markets, I don't know, but the serialization does prove a minor nuisance as you have to keep going back for more books.<br />Other than that, though, this is good, old &quot;Star Trek&quot;.  Not much is new, but that's not really necessary here.  What's important is that it's moderately engaging and true to the series.  If you're a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan and you're looking for some very light summer reading, this is a good place to find it.	2002-06-14

Tom Clancy's works have, like it or not, taken on a great deal of topicality in the last ten years.  From worries over Ireland and the Middle East to jumbo jets colliding with American buildings and the worry over nuclear and biological terrorism, Clancy's works have developed a certain level, for better or for worse, of credibility recently.<br />So, 1994's \\"Debt of Honor\\" is a bit baffling.  Of all the countries the US could consider a security threat in the modern age, Clancy picks Japan to turn his attention to.  Dusting off the tired ideas of thinly-veiled Japanese racism towards the US, continued anger over the events of World War II, and \\"the famous Japanese inscrutablility\\", Clancy shows us a Japan itching for an excuse to start a nuclear stand-off with the US.<br />I could outline the reasons why this idea is ludicrous (beginning with China and Korea), but by this point in his series, his world has become a sort-of alternate history where the US has completely disarmed it's nuclear stockpile and dismantled it's Japanese and Korean military bases, where Korea has reunified and Japan has economically pulled itself up by it's bootstraps and (apparently) mended fences with it's East Asian neighbors.  So, while I had a great diatribe for why his idea of Japanese nuclear proliferation would never work, I find it completely inappropriate for a world that has become a caricature of ours.<br />Ultimately, this book serves as a warning against the dangers of nuclear disarmament.  After bringing the world to the brink of nuclear winter in \\"The Sum of All Fears\\", Clancy's moral in \\"Debt of Honor\\" seems to be that we must always keep at least a few nuclear ICBMS squirreled away in case our best friends decide to point them at our back.  One almost wonders why he didn't imagine a new 'Axis of Evil' comprised of Japan, Britain and Sweden.<br />Anyway, within his own world, his logic makes a bizarre sort-of sense, but within the confines of real-world topicality, most of it falls apart.  Attacks on the stock market digitally and the final cliffhanger ten pages or so have jarring implications for the real world, but one must not extrapolate to the rest of the book.<br />Purely as an exercise in fantasy, I found this book to be sufficiently interesting by page 450 or so to keep me going, but I barely made it that far - needing a mental diatribe against his Japan-bashing to keep me going.  His knowledge of military units is, I am certain, superb, but he should truly study Asia in greater depth before trying to tackle it again.  His analysis of Japan ultimately comes in as poorly studied and poorly understood.  He falls back on ethnic stereotypes and fear of in what hands the Japanese government lies rather than pushing for his own analysis, or even seeming to understand that the Japanese are every bit as disparate in their opinions as any other country.  <br />For an author making his reputation based on \\"what could be\\", Tom Clancy misses the mark disturbingly in this book.  While he shouldn't always look back to Russia for inspiration 10 years after the end of the Cold War, he shouldn't cast around so desperately for a new United States adversary, either.	2002-06-11

Before reading \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\\", I had been told it had a reputation as one of the finest novels based on Dungeons and Dragons ever written, and that it was good enough to stand on it's own as fantasy outside the world of gaming fiction.  Having now read it, I found it was more like revisiting a somewhat well-run D&D game rather than a landmark fantasy epic.<br />Plotwise, the book cruises through a few pivotal weeks in the lives of nine main (and another four or five secondary) characters as they catalyze the greatest war that the planet Krynn has ever seen.  In the nine, you find your typical D&D adventuring gang, some fighters (including a barbarian and a paladin), a rogue, a cleric and a mage.  All we really needed to make this the stereotypical gaming group would be a bard - we've even got the standard backgrounds, romantic entanglements and character conflicts.<br />It's basically fluff, but it's certainly readable.  Having been a former gamer, I found it nice to go back and escape into a D&D world briefly without having to write up a character concept or worry about whether or not I stocked up on trail rations in the last town.  As a fantasy fan, I found it nice to have a good, old-fashioned meat-and-potatoes story of good vs. evil.  However, the Tolkien and George R.R. Martin fan in me wanted a lot more from the characters.  None of them really hit three-dimensionality and only one or two even made it past being total stereotypes.  Even the story was rather straightforward - betrayals and love triangles happened rather than being formed and, in most cases, came completely out of left field.<br />Ultimately, I recommend this book to the fantasy fan looking for something very light to read on the beach during summer vacation or the lonely D&D fan missing his or her group.  If you're looking for something more substantive, though, stick with Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan or even Terry Pratchett.	2002-06-02

Though &quot;A Tenured Professor&quot; was written in 1990, it's just as topical for the post-Internet boom world as it was for Reaganomics and Bush Senior's recession.  A story of a liberal economics professor who finds the key to predicting boom and bust cycles for stocks based on consumer hysteria or pessimism, it is told as a satire, but it cannot escape the sting of realism from time to time.<br />Galbraith himself, aside from being a Professor Emeritus of economics at Harvard, has a great deal of familiarity with the country's political landscape, having been, among other things, a former US Ambassador to India.  His familiarity with Washington politics in both parties comes through with striking clarity.  At times he need only to refer to a Senator or Congressman obliquely for me to know exactly who he speaks of.  Economically, as well, the book sparkles with a cynicism and perpetual questioning of whether or not economic interests control political ones.  Even his academic knowledge is impressive - it's obviously that he is both very fond and somewhat sardonic of Harvard at the same time - but it is not so much a book about academics as it is about the direction of our country.<br />If it struggles anywhere, this book struggles with it's own style.  Galbraith is obviously highly intelligent and an accomplished economist.  He is not, however, first a novelist.  This becomes apparent when he has to push the plot along from time to time in with forced dialogue or grope for it within his satirical meanderings.  However, he has enough experience with the novel as a form that it never grinds to a halt.<br />In spite of it's form - or maybe because of it, this book does have an important comment to make about the interplay between politics and economics in the United States today.  He does so so effectively, in fact, that you worry where satire leaves off and cynical reality begins.  I found myself reading this book hoping for the former and worrying over the latter.  I would recommend anyone with an interest in modern history or the process of government-running to read this and judge for themselves.	2002-05-24

In spite of the book's subtitle: \\"Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time\\", what \\"The Salmon of Doubt\\" contains, among other things, is the 79 rough-draft pages of what was probably going to be his third Dirk Gently novel.  I say probably because he states many times in his various interviews and essays that \\"The Salmon of Doubt\\" may have eventually morphed into a Hitchhiker book or, perhaps, an unrelated, stand-alone book.  What was included, though (pulled from three different drafts) is definitely Dirk Gently.<br />The rest of the book, though, is mainly interviews, essays and letters that he wrote over the course of his life and career.  Ranging from his views on religion (an avid atheist) to his status as an author and a conservationist to his love of music and his memories of school, the book feels more like a conversation with him than a memorial.  This seems to be for the best, though, as it gives a very thorough, balanced view of the man - including some of his shortcomings.<br />Of special note is the essay he wrote for P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Sunset at Blandings\\" - a discussion of the brilliance of Wodehouse's work and what it takes to read an unfinished book.  Many of the passages seem especially poignant when reading the Dirk Gently chapters.<br />Also of note is the lament by Richard Dawkins, longtime fan, friend, biologist and author of \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" and \\"The Selfish Gene\\".  After reading repeatedly in the first three chapters how Dawkins' books changed Adams' life, it is touching to read how his books had such effect on Dawkins'.<br />Ultimately, this book is worth reading for anyone who was even a casual fan of Adams.  It contains all the intelligence, wittiness and passion that makes his works worth reading (or listening to - or watching), but gives the feeling that you are actually getting to know the whole man for once.  The tragedy of Adams' death seems most poignant after finishing the book and wishing that you could sit down and discuss his life, his theories or his opinions with him and knowing that the chance is forever past.  If his books have ever interested you, read this one, too.	2002-05-15

Lois McMaster Bujold's first new Vorkosigan novel in two and a half years not only moves the story line to nearly two years after Miles and Ekaterin have been married (a story, presumably, to be chronicled some time in the future), but is the first novel since Mirror Dance to take place primarily outside the Barrayaran Empire.<br />In brief, it is a story of Miles playing troublshooter for a diplomatic incident gone horribly wrong in Quaddiespace - home of the quaddies first introduced in the novel \\"Falling Free\\".  With tensions between quaddie and the Barrayarans stretched, tensions between Cetaganda and Barrayaer taking a turn for the worse, tensions between the trader Komarrans and the militarstic Barrayarns never far below the surface and a deadline for Miles and Ekaterin to return home for the birth of their first children, and deaths reported on the Quaddies' Graf Station, everything seems stretched to the breaking point even in the first chapter.  As Miles investigates the situation, a relatively simple murder mystery rapidly transforms into a very palpable suspense with ties to many aspects of Miles' past.<br />As implied, it helps greatly to be familiar with Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga universe before reading this book.  In particular, the events of \\"Falling Free\\", \\"Cetaganda\\", \\"Mirror Dance\\" and \\"A Civil Campaign\\" all feature with varying degrees of prominence in the story.  While one could take the novel on it's own merits and probably enjoy it very much, it is much more effective when taken within previously established history.<br />While not her singularly finest Vorkosigan book to date, it is nonetheless quite good and is certainly better than the majority of science fiction available today and ranks in quality with most of the rest of her series.  It weaves together old strands of plot - perhaps eternally tying up one or two - while leaving other others wide open to, undoubtedly, bedevil Miles in the future.  I most certainly recommend this to the Vorkosigan fans eagerly awaiting the next installment of the series, but I would steer first time Lois McMaster Bujold readers back to \\"Shards of Honor\\" or, perhaps, if not wishing to go back quite so far, \\"Komarr\\".	2002-04-22

Lois McMaster Bujold has demonstrated a talent in her many books for having middle-aged characters fall in love (\\"Shards of Honor\\", \\"Falling Free\\", \\"A Civil Campaign\\").  She's also well-known for creating damaged - but not broken - heroes and heroines who pull victory from the jaws of defeat at the last moment.  These talents have held her in good stead in her Miles Vorkosigan science fiction series, but they perhaps even serve her better in \\"The Curse of Chalion\\", Bujold's second fantasy novel.<br />Her protagonist, far from being another Miles Vorkosigan, actually reminds me a bit of a cross between Brother Cadfael from Ellis Peters' series of the same name and her avuncular spymaster Simon Illian from the Vorkosigan novels - a kindly, frustrated teacher with a worldly past who follows his cause to and past the point of selflessness.  This character is definitely unique, though he shares the same spark of and for life that so many of her other characters have.<br />The story is one of unexpected boons and dangers, familiar danger (from within and without), intrigue, love and trust.  Her world is better put together than many multi-novel series I have read and her religion system is surprisingly well thought out.  The narrative is strung together surprisingly well and weaves to a wonderfully  well-choreographed ending.  <br />I really can't recommend this novel enough.  It's got the political and social cohesion of a George R. R. Martin novel, the heart of an Orson Scott Card novel and the humanity of, well, a Bujold novel.  It is, however, it's own unique entity and stands quite well on it's own merits.  If you're a Bujold fan that's skittish of her non-Vorkosigan Saga stuff, I definitely recommend giving this a shot.  If you're a fantasy fan that's a little wary of reading fantasy from a science fiction author, I also recommend trying it.  I recommend this to everyone, really, but I am hard-pressed to think of other types of readers that would need cajoling to read it.  \\"The Curse of Chalion\\" is simply the best fantasy novel I have read this year.  While I look forward to more from the Miles Vorkosigan universe, I hope she returns to this one someday as well.	2002-04-16

The 576-page \\"Rulers of the Darkness\\" should have wound up Harry Turtledove's World-War-II-as-fantasy epic and brought us through to the end of the war.  If nothing else, it should have at least brought us to the Algarvian (the German-equivalent country's) surrender.  It certainly had the length to do so.  As it is, though, it takes us only through the first nine months of the equivalent of 1943.<br />\\"Rulers of the Darkness\\" covers the retreat from Sulingen (Stalingrad) through the battle of Durrwangen (Kursk) to the retaking of Grelz (the Ukraine) by the Unkerlanters (Soviets).  In all, this covers about nine months of time and the first 55-60% of the book is just the preparations for the Kursk-equivalent battle - about three months in all.  Turtledove also works in, as before, the magical equivalent of the Manhattan Project and the Kaunian (Jewish) and Valmieran (French) resistance movements.<br />However, as before, virtually all other aspects of the war are ignored or are missing completely from his book.  The equivalents of Finland, Belgium, Britain, Japan and the Netherlands are all given minor attention while the Italy-equivalent has been all but forgotten and anything representing China or Southeast Asia is completely absent.  The Pacific Conflict between Gyongyos (Japan) and Kuusamo (America) is given more attention towards the end of the book and something looking a lot like the Omaha beach invasion of France takes place in Sibiu (The Netherlands), but much of World War II is still largely ignored.<br />As always, I appreciate Turtledove's efforts to distance the immediate emotional reaction felt from words like \\"Nazi\\", \\"Soviet\\", \\"concentration camp\\" and \\"atomic bomb\\" from the lives of people trying to survive an alternate World War II and to show shades of gray where we tend to see only black and white in school texts.  Nonetheless, he does this forgetting much of what made World War II a 'world war' - virtually the entire Pacific War.  The plights of the Chinese, Koreans, and Southeast Asians were every bit as terrible as the plights of those who struggled under Nazi Germany - or Soviet Russia.  To ignore them, I think, does a disservice to his work.<br />That said, though, \\"Rulers of the Darkness\\" remains good, compelling fiction - especially in its second half.  If you've followed the series so far, I recommend continuing with this book.  If not, go back to the first - \\"Into the Darkness\\".  Turtledove's \\"Darkness\\" series has gotten to the point where it's compelling enough as it's own tale and not just as a rehash of World War II.  Nonetheless, I wish he would finish it rather than continuing the story for at least another two books.  He only enriches the publishers by stalling out the series.	2002-03-13

The first page of \\"Starfleet: Year One\\" states that it is \\"unrelated to the events depicted in the television series Enterprise\\".  If the reader wants to enjoy what little there is to enjoy in this book, it's important to remember that.<br />\\"Starfleet: Year One\\" is the novelization of Michael Jan Friedman's twelve-part serial released by Pocket Books in all their Trek books between mid-1999 and mid-2000.  Expanded here, but originally written before \\"Deep Space Nine\\" had left the airwaves and before anyone had a good idea what the fifth Trek series would be, \\"Starfleet: Year One\\" tells the story of Earth cobbling together a very small Starfleet in the wake of the Earth-Romulan wars.  However, continuity already established in the fledgling \\"Enterprise\\" shows that much of what occurs in \\"Starfleet: Year One: could never happen.<br />The basic plot line (not that the single sentence above doesn't sum up most of what you need to know) is that, given six ships from Earth Command and a mandate to fill them with a mixture of races, a very young Starfleet find itself torn between trying to establish itself as a military presence or a scientific/exploratory one.  Half of the new starship captains fought at the final battle of the Earth-Romulan War and are very militaristic and half are scientists, merchants or loners who fit the 'explorer' category.  Tensions build between the two factions to see which side will have a captain chosen to command the U.S.S. Daedalus, the first of a new fleet of vessels that can travel Warp 3 and hold over two hundred people.<br />None of this is makes for bad writing necessarily, but Friedman fills his work with every possible continuity reference imaginable.  While he primarily draws from the Original Series episode \\"Balance of Terror\\" and the Next Generation episode \\"Power Play\\", he draws even the most incidental plot points from so many other episodes that you begin to think that he fears that if even one continuity reference is missing, the narrative will completely fall apart.  For example, he sets up a three-page dialogue just to make a continuity reference about the book responsible for the Original Series episode \\"A Piece of the Action\\".  Likewise, not one of his characters (and there are many) has a personality that can't be summed up in one sentence.  Most of them essentially end up as caricatures of one personality trait or another.<br />Friedman's premise certainly isn't bad, and he definitely did his homework in compiling a backstory, but it ultimately falls flat on his annoying characters and Saturday-morning-cartoonesque storytelling.  The ending, likewise, comes out as a bad mix of science and fictional anthropology with a trite moral tacked on to it for good measure.  While the way is open for a sequel - or a series - I find myself oddly grateful that there will never be any more books in the series.  Even though I like the universe he cobbles together, I'm grateful that the rather sad caricatures won't be back for more adventures.<br />This is a book that, ultimately, I find myself recommending only to the die-hard \\"Star Trek\\" fan that won't let the continuity issues bother him too much (possibly an oxymoron, I know).  Otherwise, if you're interested in the beginning of a much more well-realized \\"Star Trek\\" universe, go watch \\"Enterprise\\"., the narrative will completely fall apart.  For example, he sets up a three-page dialogue just to make a continuity reference about the book responsible for the Original Series episode \\"A Piece of the Action\\".

The last few years have seen a spate of new histories covering the last three hundred years of Japanese history.  From Herbert Bix's and John Dower's Pulitizer Prize-winning looks at Japan in the Twentieth Century to Marius Jansen and now James McClain's examinations of post-Sengoku ('Warring States') societal evolution, Japanese history is again attracting the attention of mainstream American readers.<br />McClain's new book takes us from Tokugawa Ieyasu's country-uniting victory at Sekigahara in 1600 (with a brief stop to quickly explain the millennium of history leading up to the battle) to Yoshiro Mori's cabinet of 2000-2001.  It covers political history, governmental development, economic evolution, societal change, educational systems and intellectual debates through this entire span of time giving a very synthetic view of Japanese history.  <br />If anything, McClain's book weighs in a bit more heavily on the economic and governmental development side of the equation, leaving political history to books that have covered it many times before.  He shows all of modern Japanese history (defined as 1600 AD to the present) as dynamic, evolving and never quite fully under the control of any one person or group.  A view that has gained a great deal of credence in modern years, it makes this history of Japan very timely.<br />Unsurprisingly, the past century of Japanese history takes up the lion's share of the book and he shows the tragic mistakes of the century in much the same way he showcases the triumphs.  If any one thesis appears in his book, it is that Japan continues to evolve, hangs on to the past and appears to be at the cusp of a new societal evolution as the century ticks over.  The first two are hardly news, and while the third may be a little controversial in some circles, these views merit reiteration in a historical retelling.<br />On the whole, McClain's book makes for a very necessary addition to the available reference works on Japanese history, especially given the economic and societal bent to his writing.  His sources are impeccable and his work is conservative enough to stand as a good history while being just radical enough to push a few boundaries of intellectual thought about Japan.  It doesn't hurt that the work is quite readable as well.  If I ever teach a course on Japanese history, this book will serve as the core historical text.	2002-02-22

Not so much another retelling of a year of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the ultimate reference guide to Season 12 of the series, &quot;Doctor Who: The Scripts, Tom Baker 1974/5&quot; tells virtually everything you could want to know about the production and execution of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the first year of Tom Baker's tenure as the Doctor.  Included here are the scripts (complete with changes made during shooting) for all 20 episodes across the 5 stories of the year, story histories, production notes, casting choices, transmission information, music notes, prop histories and inventories, scene sketches and maps, reproductions of newspaper clippings, notes on potential but unmade stories, changes made for American TV, audience reaction polls, and a ton of footnoting for just about every reason imaginable.<br />More than any other behind-the-scenes science fiction book I've read, this one really tells you what tough choices and concessions had to be made, why they chose person A over person B, what got cut for budgetary reasons (a common problem with Doctor Who) and what concessions (or lack thereof) were made for continuity.  This book is a massive undertaking, and, indeed, authorship is spread between numerous people.  If there is a question you want answered about Season 12 of Doctor Who, the odds are really good it's in here somewhere.<br />While I find it hard to recommend this book to the casual Doctor Who fan, it's invaluable to the die-hard Whovian or the student of film or TV production.  This is simply the finest production book I've read and I dearly hope to see them tackle other seasons in the same way in the future.	2002-01-21

The most recent in a long string of books by Westerners on &quot;My Year in Japan&quot; or &quot;My Trip Through Japan&quot; or &quot;What I Have To Say About Japan That Is More Profound Than Anything Ever Said By Any Other JET Teacher&quot; that I have read, Will Ferguson's &quot;Hokkaido Highway Blues&quot; is the most realistic, introspective, important Japan travelogue I have read so far.<br />Reading at many times more like &quot;Dave Barry Does Japan&quot; than the standard book of foreigner angst, Ferguson manages to temper his humor with a realistic look at Japan that usually manages to be honest but not cynical.  Early in the book he discusses the standard foreigner complex about Japan in which you neither love Japan nor hate it, but lovehate it.  Keeping that in mind throughout the book, it gives a good idea for the feel of the entire book.<br />Ferguson covers everything from the Ainu to love hotels, but still manages to dig into ideas like aestheticism, prejudice and deconstructionism without coming off as either lecturing or glib.  He understands, perhaps better than any popular author of Japan I've read so far, that to take a balanced, fair look at Japan, you have to be willing to understand and accept Japan's serious issues side-by-side with its beauty.<br />The narrative itself covers his almost-two-thousand mile rip across Japan that roughly antiparallels Alan Booth's famous trip in &quot;The Road to Sata&quot;.  He hitchhikes (virtually) the entire way and describes the people he meets on his trip, intermixing them with trivia and points of historical and anthropological importance along the way.  His narrative ranges from melancholy and introspective to manic, but always keeps you pacing along with him during his journey.  It also keeps you laughing at the most surprising moments.<br />If I have one problem with his book, it's the very abrupt way it ends, with little sense of reflection, completion or deep understanding.  By the time he hits CapeSoya in Nothern Hokkaido (the northernmost of the four main Japanese islands), his narrative has sped up to the point that his commentary has been left behind in favor of simply making it to the end of his trip as fast as he can go.  His ostensible reason for the trip in the first place is to follow the cherry blossoms northward as they bloom in Japan, but much as he outstrips their blooming in Hokkaido, he begins to outstrip his own interest in storytelling in the last half of the last section.<br />That said, though, the book is still excellent.  I laughed continuously and I appreciated his tempered view of Japan.  For anyone interested in seeing Japan through the eyes of someone who has throroughly examined the country, I definitely recommend this book.  I certainly recommend it far more than any other extended Japanese travelogue I've read to date.	2002-01-16
US	52673767	R1ZQMVGXSEZQMM	0451458486	353854112	The Peshawar Lancers	Books	5	56	60	N	N	Sort of a Neo-Victorian Imperial James Bond...	S.M. Stirling's latest foray into alternate history is one with a rather inspired premise: after Europe and America are bombarded with comets in 1878, the British Empire must pick up its scattered pieces and reclocate to India.  Now, a hundred and fifty years later, the new Britanno-Indian Empire struggles its way through 21st Century politics.  While some of it reminds me of the early chapters of Robert Charles Wilson's Hugo-nominated &quot;Darwinia&quot;, &quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot; shares much thematically with Stirling's &quot;Islander&quot; saga: Western culture gets rocked back on its heels, but ultimately struggles and survives in a world that it has unintentionally changed.<br />Stirling has given a great deal of attention to his world - and it shows.  Especially interesting in their own alternate-historical merit are the five appendices at the end of the book that deal with the events of the cometary impact, the British Exodus to India, the state of the world and the British Empire and the level of science and technology in his world of 2025.  He has given thought to all of the major players in a world that seems almost more like Asia of the 1920s than the 2020s, but every country comes off as believable and most fall within what I could even see as plausible - given a little dramatic license, of course.<br />The story itself is a great deal of fun, too.  The main character, Athelstane King, is an Imperial Army captain, a young manor lord and a reluctant conscript into his Majesty's service following the uncovering of a conspiracy by the Russian Czar in Samarkand.  The story follows him, his armsman, his sister, an Afghan assassin, the Imperial Heir-Apparent and a Algerio-French emissary through Bzyantine plots and a very-well-realized Imperial India.  It deals out action, romance, culture and history in equal measure and does so in a way that never drags or lectures.<br />My reservations about the book (and I have one or two) are relatively minor anddeal mainly with personal differences in interpretation than complete implausibility.  Having recently flipped through David Cannadine's &quot;Ornamentalism: How the British Saw Their Empire&quot;, I find myself wondering if even in the necessity of survival, whether or not the British fleeing to India would have 'gone native' to the extent they have in Stirling's book.  Certainly, the intergration of British and Indian culture makes for an interesting story and Stirling certainly researched the dynamics of Indian culture well, but I find it a point that I wish I could agree more fully with.  Likewise (and this is an even less important point), I question his portrayal of Dai-Nippon (Greater Japan) a bit.  As with India, he has certainly studied the culture and history of Japan, but I am not entirely certain how well he has acquainted himself with the attitudes of the times.  Given the Japanese propensity for technological innovation and the fact that in 1878 Japan was coming out of a civil war and seriously looking to compete with Western powers (and that it would have been on the other side of the world from the comet impacts), I think Japan would have embarked on a far more ambitious plan of expansion with less recovery time that Stirling shows.  Nonetheless, this too is a very minor point.<br />That aside, though, I highly recommend this book.  It's a great read, it's terribly well thought-out and it is very easy to find yourself getting caught up in this very compelling world.  I hope not only that this book becomes part of a wider series (it ends on a half-closed note, but certainly with the possibility of much more), but that Stirling takes us to other parts of the world - French Algeria, the Caliphate of Damascus, Greater Japan, the barbarian wilds of America and Western Europe and the rest of the Angrezi Raj (Britanno-Indian Empire) in books to come.  I, for one, eagerly await them.	2002-01-12

Centering around a Ph.D. candidate studying in Rome in the late 1930s, early 1940s, it tackles the idea question of &quot;What would you do if you had the chance to save the Roman Empire?&quot;<br />Perched at the very edge of the twilight of the (Western) Roman civilization, it realistically tackles the political, scientific and cultural problems of the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. in southern Europe.  De Camp was not only a famous science fiction author (a lesser-known contemporary of Isaac Asimov), but he was a published historian and classicist in his own right.  This book showcases all three of those fields in one go - at the height of his writing talent.<br />The short story paired with this, &quot;To Bring The Light&quot; by David Drake, is less meant as a serious contender in terms of literary quality than an homage to de Camp's work.  Dealing with the founding of the Roman civilization in much the way that &quot;Lest Darkness Fall...&quot; deals with it's death throes, it succeeds in showing the David Drake's admiration for de Camp's work.<br />Ultimately, though, I'd buy the book for &quot;Lest Darkness Fall...&quot;: it's a surprisingly ignored but wonderful novel that paved the way for what has become an entire sub-field of science fiction.  Whether you like alternate history or not, though, this book should not be missed.	2002-01-01

Having dealt with many of the other major members of the Valdoria-Skolia-Selei family, Asaro now turns her attention to Dyhianna, the Ruby Pharoah and the woman that created the means by which the Skolian Imperialiate functions as it does: the psiberweb.<br />For those of you not familiar with Asaro's Skolian universe, in a nutshell, humans crawl their way into the stars in the twenty-second century to find out that, surprisingly enough, humans already occupy most, if not all, of the inhabited planets in the galaxy.  Two warring Empires, the Skolians and the Eubians, have fought to control about three-quarters or so of the inhabited planets in the galaxy between them.  The Skolians are, in theory, a democracy, although power is uneasily shared between the Skolian ruling family and an elected council.  They run their Empire-Democracy through the means of a sort-of collective mental net in which sufficiently sensitive telepaths can communicate instantly with each other, providing an unparalleled means of coordination within the culture.  The Eubians, on the other hand, are not only tyrannic and imperial, but they are obsessed with genetics and virtually all the ihabitants of their Empire are slaves.  Earth, which finds itself the great Switzerland of the galaxy, finds itself often on the sidelines holding together an alliance that provides the pivot on which the galactic balance of pwer hangs.<br />All of her previous books have dealt with various members of the Skolian royal family, but Pharaoh Dyhianna has always been a rather shadowy background figure.  This book deals with her (from a first-preson perspective) in the wake of the Radiance War that nearly destroyed both the Skolians and the Eubians.  It shows Dyhianna in a very surprising light - a woman who is not always easy with her power or the galactic attention she recieves.  She is fiercely intelligent, but also quite jealous of her and her family's privacy and power,  Dyhianna's saga in &quot;Spherical Harmonic&quot; involves her finding herself (literally) after the end of the war and her impressive struggle to reunite her fractured family.<br />As with the best books in the Skolian Saga, this one focuses equally on politics, physics and family.  Asaro in this book also avoids her sometime tendency (which, admittedly, occurs more with male than female protagonists) to discuss their romantic exploits in quite graphic detail.  It is tender, exciting and surprising all in one go.  I recommend the entire Skolian Saga, but I do not recommend starting here if you're not familiar with the series.  Begin with &quot;Primary Inversion&quot; instead.  If you are, definitely read it and if you've been put off by some of the other books in the series, this is book to return to the series with.but also quite jealous of her and her family's privacy and power,  Dyhianna's saga in &quot;Spherical Harmonic&quot; involves her finding herself (literally) after the end of the war and her impressive struggle to reunite her fractured family.<br />As with the best books in the Skolian Saga, this one focuses equally on politics, physics and family.

For &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;, Terry Pratchett's 28th Discworld book, he states in the Author's Note at the end that he did a lot of research into rats before writing this book.  It shows.<br />This also marks Pratchett's first Discworld book for the young adult set.  It actually serves as a pretty good introduction to the Discworld, giving us an entirely new set of characters to play with thart aren't bogged down in the already established Discworld cosmology (save the necessary cameo by Death, the famous anthropomorphic personification).<br />The story is a spin, obviously, on The Pied Piper of Hamlin, but with Pratchett's usual fairy-tale-crashes-head-on-into-real-world take on things.  The rats (and cat) talk - and scheme and scam - but do so in a way completely at odds with the standard Disney-like children's book characters.  They're really more characters trying to come to terms with being saddled with things they never wanted - like sentience - than anthropomorphic animals.  In fact, stories like Peter Cottontail (and the Brothers Grimm) are parodied throughout the book.<br />In keeping with Pratchett's previously mentioned belief in previous books that kids are just as capable (if not more, in some cases) of dealing with nastiness, death and general unpleasantness, Pratchett doesn't really pull any punches in his narrative.  He treats rats as they really are - smelly, foul, incontinent sometime cannibals.  That's not to say that, like all of his protagonists, they're not actually good beings - they're just not cute, fluffy and sweet.<br />However, all this said, it's still a story about humankind - and ratkind - triumphing over it's baser beliefs and practices.  It's a great story and which, as with all of Pratchett's best books - deals out humor, suspense and creepiness in equal measure.  I recommend it for kids, adults, Discworld fans and those new to the series.  It's as good as any Discworld book he's done so far and it doesn't need the established background to tell a great story.	2001-12-24

In his second collaborative Discworld 'picture' book (the first Being &quot;Eric&quot;, which never received a proper release here in the States), Terry Pratchett shows that the momentum he seems to have regained in his last two or three books continues to mount.  While the story is his shortest novel yet, it's packed with enough adventure for two of his regular novels.<br />Featuring not only Cohen the Barbarian and Rincewind, but also Carrot, the wizards of Unseen University and Leonard of Quirm, he somehow manages to combine the legend of Prometheus with the Apollo Program while tossing in evil overlords, Schrodinger's Cat and everything you ever wanted to know about dragons.<br />The story is vintage Pratchett and the illustrations are all gorgeous.  While sometimes threatening to overwhelm the text, they work to immerse us in the Discworld in a way that, surprisingly enough, surpasses Pratchett's usual work.  From beautifully rendered characters and Discscapes to the notes of Leonard and technical schematics, they give you the feeling of a Discworld almost real enough to touch.<br />If you're a Terry Pratchett fan, I can't recommend this book enough.  Even with the somewhat steep price tag, it's well worth adding to a Pratchett collection.  If you're not overly familiar with Pratchett, I recommend starting at a different book in the series, perhaps &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; or &quot;Small Gods&quot; and then moving on to this one after getting a feel for the series.  However, once you've gotten a feel for the series, definitely come back to this one.	2001-11-02

Since the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese government in 1997, the former British colony seems to be slowly slipping out of the world's attention.  In Mr. Fenby's look at the year 1999 as Hong Kong lived it, we see not only why we need to watch Hong Kong closely, but we realize what stakes China is playing with as it slowly comes to terms with theis quasi-democratic city and its place in the world.<br />Mr. Fenby writes the book as essentially a journalist's diary that spans the entire course of 1999 - the final year that Mr. Fenby was editor of the South China Morning Post, arguably the premiere English-language newspaper in Hong Kong.  He details not only the key figures in Hong Kong politics and the economy - at a very personal level - but also how China deals with Hong Kong and how the events of 1999 (everything from Falun Gong to the Taliban) shaped China's responses.<br />I think Mr. Fenby sees 1999 as not only the year that China stopped observing Hong Kong and began acting, but also the year that many of the fundamental agreememnts laid down between China and Hong Kong got tested.  He shows the slow erosion of judicial and political autonomy caused, not through outright repression, but by behind-the-scenes deal-making and a desire of the political powers-that-be in Hong Kong not to ruffle mainland feathers.<br />His book is eminently readable and in many parts reads more like a political thriller than a diary or a report.  If there is one criticism with the book, it is that when Mr. Fenby loses his job at the South China Morning Post in July of 1999, his personal hurt comes out quite clearly in the course of the narrative and possibly influences his objectivity throughout the rest of the year.  However, were it me, I think that I would be hard-pressed to maintain even Mr. Fenby's level of detachment.<br />All in all, the book is not only fascinating and illuminating, but it is also quite enjoyable.  I found myself caught up in the power play between China and Hong Kong as if it were a first-rate novel.  However, the book is not a novel, and it does contain some rather chilling messages for the future of Hong Kong.  If you have any interest in China - or interest in China's relationship with the Western world - I recommend not missing this book.	2001-10-29

The Tokyo subway sarin gas attack of 1995 is an event that continues to baffle and anger the Japanese.  However, as Murakami points out in his book, it is also something the Japanese would prefer to condemn and move on from rather than analyze and try to understand.  Murakami's approach is to interview survivors of the attack, relatives of those that have died, and members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult that, while not involved with the gas attack, were members of Aum at the time the attack occurred.<br />The first two-thirds of the book are dedicated to the survivors and relative interviews.  While touching, shocking and surprising, after the first dozen or two, they begin to take on a numbing quality.  So many of the stories share so many themes (&quot;I had to get to work...&quot;, &quot;I'm not so much angry as confused&quot;, etc.) that, in retrospect, they run together.  In fact, the two things about the attack that stand out most in my mind are that (a) while some of the survivors and family members are incredibly angry over the situation, most are not so much angry as confused and hurt, and (b) while almost everyone agrees that the situation was handled incredibly poorly by the emergency services and lives were lost as a result, no one wants to sue.  They merely wish to get on with their lives.  <br />Where the book really shines, though, is in the Aum interviews.  Murakami profiles members of the cult who came from different backgrounds, had different aims in joining Aum and saw different sides of it as members.  In this section, we begin to see the breakdown of the &quot;salaryman phenomenon&quot; in Japan at a personal level.  People who joined were mostly intelligent, if highly misguided, and wanted more from their lives than office work could give them.  Between the two groups, Murakami begins to show a Japan wtih serious social issues straining below the surface of an otherwise quiet and conformist society.<br />Admittedly, this sort of classification may be a little premature for Japan, but it does indicate the Japan faces the same problems today that many others (like the US) face.  I recommend this book not just for those interested in the gas attack and the people were that committed it, but also for the political scientists and the social anthropologists wanting a look at the problems and difficulties facing Japan as a country.  While, as Murakami himself says, he is primarily a novelist and this is his first real attempt at nonfiction, I hope he revisits this format in the future when looking at other modern problems in Japan.	2001-08-06
US	52673767	R1OT6HY9W8W0VP	0399146911	912336131	American Fuji: A Novel	Books	4	4	6	N	N	An Incredibly Effective Look at Expat Life...	Having read just about every book that deals with foreigners living in Japan, I think that Sara Backer's book probably captures the ambiguity, the contradictions and the conceptual gap between the English-speaking world and Japan better than any other novel or travelogue I have read thus far.  That said, the plot does leave something to be desired.<br />The protagonists of the book are a recently fired American professor of English living in Shizuoka, near Mt. Fuji (obviously, as you can see from the title, Mt. Fuji imagery plays an important part in the book) and an American novelist visitng Japan near the anniversary of his son's death - an exchange student who died during his year abroad.  Both characters deal with their situations very realistically: Gaby, the professor, who has lived in Japan for years, finds herself running up against racism and misogyny frequently, both subtlely and bluntly, but never stops finding the time to appreciate the aspects of her life that make her life in Japan worth living.  Likewise, Alex, the novelist, finds himself overwhelmed with the imagery, the arrogance and the cultural confusion of Japan, but still struggles (frequently unsuccessfully) to find a point of connection in almost every Japanese person he meets.  Even the country itself is portrayed very effectively - sometimes elegantly, sometimes ludicrously and sometimes as one great contradiction.  She even balances these three aspects of life in Japan, something most authors forget to do.<br />However, the plot itself rapidly devolves into overused plot devices and even a few stereotypes by the middle third of the book.  Needless sentimentality is shown, not just on the part of the main characters, but even in the authors descriptions of character reactions.  Likewise, many of the supporting characters (such as Marubatsu, Alex's son's sponsor in Japan who is a  professor at Gaby's old university and Lester, an expat friend of Gaby's stuck teaching for Berlitz) begin as very interesting people, but rapidly become predictable and one-dimensional.  However, no one should really read this book for the plot.  If you do, you're missing the only really valid reason for reading it.<br />The plot aside, though, Backer provides a more balanced, a more knowledgeable and ultimately a more believable Japan as seen through the eyes of Americans than of any author I've read thus far.  She avoids the sermons given by such supposedly reputable authors of Japanese culture such as Bruce Feiler or T.R. Reid.  She avoids overplaying the kitsch of Japan in ways that authors like William Gibson fail to do and she offers Japanese that are capable of failure and who don't even necessarily understand their own culture in a way that James Clavell never succeeded in showing.  Perhaps, in fact, this is where her novel shines best: it balances the contradictions of Japan and the difficulties of life there while not making a value judgement on the culture as a whole.  It shows Japan as a fascinating culture, not a 'good' or a 'bad' one.<br />So, if you enjoy reading about Japan or about East Asia in the 20th/21st centuries, definitely give this book a try.  It describes the lives of Westerners in Japan today more effectively than any other book I've seen so far.  Just don't read it for the plot.	2001-07-21

Simply put, Reid credits virtually positive aspect of East Asian culture - from Malaysia to Japan - at the feet of Confucianism.  In the process, her ignores 2500 years of Taoism, Buddhism, Shintoism, Islam, Christianity not to mention national policies, cultural groups, and historical figures (other than Confucius and Mencius, of course).  Furthermore, he holds up issues like education in Japan as triumphs of Confucianism while ignoring - or possibly being blind to - the serious issues caused by such institutions in the way they are practiced today (such as the current problems in Japanese education with entrance exams and the chronic failure of the Japanese educational system to teach critical and synthetical skills).<br />In reading this book, I questioned the Washington Post's wisdom in making him their Tokyo Bureau chief.  It seems from his talks of jet-setting around East Asia that he was spoon-fed the glamorous, exciting parts and never dug further than the obvious and publicly acknowledged social ills when reporting.  While he knows the facts of Asian history, he seems blind to many of the motivations behind the hatreds that occur there between groups and countries.  For example, he more or less brushes off Japan's half century occupation of Korea with comments on how it is a shame that Korea can still hate so much after so long, seemingly completely ignoring fifty years of pillage, enslavement, subjection and tyranny.<br />The one redeeming quality of this book (and still not enough to save it from a minimal rating in my eyes) is that the travelogue/anecdotal part of this book is quite entertaining.  His discussions of aspects of East Asian life like indoor beaches and Japanese takes on American fast food are both well written and funny.  However, none of this excuses the rest of hisbook.<br />On the whole, Reid's book is not only a bad argument, it's bad journalism.  He fails to dig deeply or think critically and in the process makes an argument than in parts is even offensive.  To top it all off, he even includes a section at the end on what is wrong with the thesis of his book.  He not only spends three pages discussing why he has done such a great thing in including this section while failing to realize that it is standard practice in academic writing, but then spends most of that section pondering whether or not &quot;Asia&quot; is a valid concept (a worthy discussion, but not truly relevant to the meat of his thesis) and devotes less time to the actual substance of what's wrong with his argument than why he deserves accolades for writing about it.  Unless you enjoy a running mental diatribe against the author while you read a book, I recommend staying far, far away from it.	2001-07-10

For those of you that aren't familiar with Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, they're broken up into what are, essentially subseries.  Different novels focus on different characters throughout the Disc and each follow a certain storytelling style.  The Rincewind novels, of which this is one, are a sort-of antiheroical adventure mixed with what are, essentially, various travelogues.  &quot;Interesting Times&quot; deals with what happens when the Disc's least impressive wizard - and greatest survivor - meet the Agatean Empire - a rather odd hodge-podge of Imperial China and feudal Japan run through Pratchett's colander of Discworld reality.<br />&quot;Interesting Times&quot; follows a half-mad, half-Machiavellian plot where Rincewind, the aforementioned 'wizard', gets shipped off to the Agatean Empire following a request by the revolutionary &quot;Red Army&quot; for the &quot;Great Wizzard&quot; that will help them in their time of greatest need.  What results from this is a mad rush through Chinese peasant culture, Japanese martial arts, an group of ancient barbarians with a most unbarbarian plot and revolution that can't help but have things go the right way for them.<br />As with most of Pratchett's books, &quot;Interesting Times&quot; is a joy to read.  Pratchett somehow seems to take every 'commonly known' reference about East Asia, mix them together in a large metaphorical bag, and spread them throughout his book, regardless of the history or accuracy involved.  As with all of his works, what transpires is less a view of what foreign countries are actually like, but how it is that we as people view foreign cultures.<br />Having recently reread &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, I found myself liking it more in retrospect than I did when I first read it.  It's charming, introspective and loony all in one go.  A brief word of warning to the odd East Asian scholar who made read it, though: it's not so much about what Japan and China are like as what people think theyare like.  Nonetheless, it's a book that any Terry Pratchett fan should read.  It's even a book that any fan of Japan or China should read.  It's also not a bad place to get into the Discworld series if you're looking for a place to start.	2001-03-19

Harry Turtledove continues his (sort of) retelling of World War II in &quot;Through the Darkness&quot;, the third book in his World-War-II-as-a-fantasy-epic series.  The third book in the series is just as effective - and enjoyable - as the previous two and takes us from the equivalent of early spring 1942 through the winter of 1942-43.<br />This book covers the continuation of (primarily) the equivalent of the European theater of the war and details the fighting up through this world's equivalent of the end of the seige of Stalingrad - Sulingen in Turtledove's world - by Algarvian (German) forces as well as the Lagoan and Kuusaman (British and American) victory in North Africa and the continuing research by the Kuusamans (Americans) into the the nature of magic (read: The Manhattan Project).<br />As with the previous books in the series, this one does not parallel World War II exactly and while most of the major countries that fought in World War II are included (the major exception being China), attention is definitely focused far more on Turtledove's equivalents of Germany, France, Poland and Russia than it is on the countries representing America, Britain and Japan.  In fact, the Pacific War practically does not exist in the series as the role of China seems to be portrayed by Unkerlant, the Russia-equivalent, and the entire Pacific War is told from the perspective of one character given roughly equal weight with the other people whose stories are told.  To put this in perspective, the Poles and the Jews have three characters, the Germans three, the Soviets two, the French two, and the Americans, Finns, Belgians, British and Dutch one each.<br />As with the previous novels, the story of the war is told through each of the characters and many important events are either lived through or mentioned as background information, depending on whether or not he has a character in the appropriate location.  The characters are all pretty standard for this style of story (the Darkness series is very similar in style to the Worldwar series and the Great War series) and while entertaining, none of them have great depth.  The real fun of the story is in comparing the story to the actual history.<br />I, for one, learned a fair amount of history after reading this book, much like I did after reading the previous two.  If anything, it reminded me how little I knew of the European Theatre of the War and has definitely given me the incentive to read more about World War II - which, after all, may well be Turtledove's point in writing the series.  He certainly does a good job of presenting World War II from a nontraditional viewpoint and definitely reminds us that not everyone that fights for an evil cause is evil - or that everyone that fights for a good one is good.  <br />On the whole, I definitely recommend giving this series a try.  While I regret the fact that so little attention is paid to the equivalent of the Pacific side of the war - the history of the Pacific War is every bit a fascinating and terrifying as the European War - it's definitely a worthy read.  If you haven't read the previous novels already (Into the Darkness and Darkness Descending), though, I definitely recommend picking those up first.	2001-03-08

I think that perhaps no modern fantasy writer is as likely to have a graduate seminar in the humanities taught about his works in a hundred years than is Terry Pratchett.  Pratchett is the only modern fantasy writer I can think of that successfully mixes parody, social commentary, allegory and themes of the humanities into stories that you have to read on multiple levels to fully appreciate.  Thankfully, he continues this with &quot;The Truth&quot;.<br />For the first time since &quot;Men at Arms&quot; - or &quot;Soul Music&quot;, depending on the chronology you use for the series - we are given an invention of the modern world and shown how the semi-medieval city of Ankh-Morpork copes with it.  In this case, it's the printing press.  Pratchett is back in full form after a couple of worrying books and in this one he does a good job of mixing the methods that made his Ankh-Morpork City Watch subseries so wonderful with the allegory of books like &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and &quot;Soul Music&quot; while being far lighter and somewhat more subtle than he has been in the past.<br />&quot;The Truth&quot; also introduces a new subseries to the Discworld that hopefully we will see a lot more of.  The staff of the newspaper works wonderfully together in this book and I hope we see as much plot development from them in future books as we've seen from the subseries that focus on the Ankh-Morpork City Watch or the Witches of Lancre.<br />All in all, I thought this book was a return to the glory days of Pratchett that I remember reading from &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; to &quot;Interesting Times&quot;.  If you're a serious Terry Pratchett fan you've probably picked it up already, but in case you haven't - do so.  If you're a new fan of his and looking to find a place to get into his works, there are worse books than this to start with.	2001-03-03
US	52673767	R2R9UFSPGJN01P	015100448X	225010826	Mendoza in Hollywood: A Novel of the Company	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Impressive Inconstistency or Slow Plot Exposition?	About two-thirds of the way through &quot;Mendoza in Hollywood&quot;, I found myself getting rather disappointed with the book.  The sotry was beginning to drag, I was starting to find Baker's inside knowledge of California more a self-serving egotism than a colorful plot setting and the promised reincarnation of the other big protagonist from &quot;In the Garden of Iden&quot; had not yet shown up.<br />The last hundred pages were a very impressive surprise.  Interesting new twists were added, more information - and speculation - about The Company were slowly unpeeled and a few new genuinely fascinating questions popped up.  Plot points that seemed overused or pointless even found their way into interesting and inexplicable threads.  In retrospect, I find the book even more fascinating than I did immediately after I finished it.<br />Like its predecessor, &quot;Mendoza in Hollywood&quot; differs very markedly from what came before.  The glib parody of Joseph in &quot;Sky Coyote&quot; is replaced by the much more down-to-Earth - and depressed - Mendoza as she once again takes the stage and the plot evens out a lot.  Her fligts of fancy in this book avoid parody and instead involve conspiracies, the paranormal and the glory days of Hollywood in the 1920s (even though the book itself primarily takes place in 1862/1863).  The realism in the book may not be more pronounced than in &quot;Sky Coyote&quot;, but at least Baker is using creative license to advance the plot and not to make social commentary.<br />Taken in retrospect, I really enjoyed this book.  Baker takes a lot longer to work up to the action than she did in &quot;Mendoza&quot;'s predecessors, but the plot entanglements certainly make up for this fact.  As with the first two Company books, this one is not without its drawbacks, but the story and mystery that she weaves are such that they are relatively easy to overlook.  The first two Company novels were wonderful and this one continues the saga impressively.	2001-02-08
US	52673767	R2BVFAS3OA20PN	0380731800	701049138	Sky Coyote (A Novel of the Company, Book 2)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Shift Into Parody?	I was very impressed with the historical accuracy and the sense of historical parallax in &quot;In the Garden of Iden&quot;, so I found myself having to consider my reaction to Baker's second book in her &quot;Company&quot; series, &quot;Sky Coyote&quot;.  It's not an easy book to digest immediately after reading &quot;Iden&quot;, so it took me some time to decide that I liked it.<br />There are certainly many wonderful things about the book.  The viewpoint of Joseph, the &quot;erstwhile mentor&quot; of Mendoza gives the book a surprisingly light-hearted feel and makes the setting of the series almost new again.  The way she gradually peels back layers of the mysyery surrounding the Company also makes me want to keep reading just to find out what's going on and whether or not my suspicions are going to be confirmed.<br />However, I question find myself questioning her use of parody in this book.  It gives a radical departure from the book before - frequently a good thing with sequels - but to do so it heightens the suspension of disbelief required when reading it.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the tribal scenes and I found the commentary on modern society cute if not quite charming.  It just wasn't keeping in the same style as not only the book before, but much of the rest of &quot;Sky Coyote&quot; itself.  Every time we dealt wih the Native Americans in the story the old historians' quote, &quot;The past is like a foreign country; they do things differently there.&quot; kept floating through my head.<br />Ultimately, though, the book is still a very worthy read.  Baker succeeds in making the Company - and the series - an entity that we want to know more about.  Joseph is a character I look forward to reading more about in &quot;The Graveyard Game&quot; and, presumably, other books after that.  Baker has me firmly hooked to the series and I'm interested to see where she takes it from here.  I just hope she steers a course in 'recorded' history a little closer to the plausible in future books.	2001-02-04

Time travel is nothing new to science fiction.  Even the idea of people travelling through time to preserve (or to try to alter) the timeline of the world is not new to science fiction.  The idea of hiding in the shadows of history to preserve that which would otherwise be lost, though...<br />I was really impressed with the premise of &quot;In the Garden of Iden&quot;.  I thought the idea of a company that could make employees of 'indigenous' people and send them along ('along' mind you, not 'through') history to preserve plants, animals, art works, etc. only as long as they did not change history in the process to be a neat, if not revolutionary idea.  Baker pulls off the idea quite well to in this book.  She gives us a good feel of history unfolding while the characters of the book go about their mission in a country that's teetering on the verge of a new dark age just before it's greatest era begins.<br />The science in the book is well-researched.  The history in the book is very well researched.  Even the romance manages to push the reader into an interesting parallax between love and practicality.  Surprisingly enough, the one thing that bothered me about the novel was the stipulation in the premise that people sent back couldn't change &quot;recorded history&quot;.  I found myself wondering what constitutes 'recorded history'.  We as a race have so much difficulty sorting the fact from the lie and the myth in our 'recorded' history - even in the past century - that I wondered how valid an argument this could be.  Perhaps it's an idea that she'll pursue in a later &quot;Company&quot; novel.  I'd be interested to see what she could do with it...<br />All in all, I really enjoyed this novel.  I blew through it like I haven't blown through a science fiction novel in a long time.  While some of the topics it deals with are quite heavy, the overall read is really light.  If you're looking for a fun, light book with a genuinely interesting premise, I recommend picking &quot;In the Garden of Iden&quot; up.  Personally, I'm looking forward to getting on to the rest of the series...	2001-01-31
US	52673767	R5F1VURLSQ4KB	0824814886	173179686	Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan	Books	5	35	35	N	N	The Definitive Book on Edo-Era Culture and Prostitution...	For anyone doing serious work on sexuality (Japanese or otherwise), prostitution or Japanese history or even Japanese political culture, &quot;Yoshiwara&quot; is not to be missed.  Seigle has written not only a comprehensive, but fascinating and accessable book about the history of the licensed prostitution quarter near (now inside) Tokyo during the Tokugawa Era.<br />She gives a fascinating (if at times - by necessity - disturbing) look at how sexual politics and popular culture were regulated and maintained during the Tokugawa Shogunate.  She gives equal weight to everything from architecture and anecdotes and gives an impressively complete cross-section of life in the district throughout the vast majority of the Yoshiwara's history.  The picture she gives is also one that shows rise, evolution and decline of the district in equal importance.  Even the cultural impact of the Yoshiwara upon cultural phenomena like style and societal standing are covered in admirable depth.  <br />I have found this book of great use in studies of both Japanese sexuality and urban history.  Seigle does a wonderful job of neither romanticizing nor attacking the Yoshiwara, but is (on the whole) content to lay out as complete a history and case study as she can.  For any serious student of Japanese history or culture, I recommend not missing this book.	2001-01-16
US	52673767	R3H6RSSPCJ5SNJ	0312876513	882430933	Shadow of the Hegemon (The Shadow Series)	Books	4	73	82	N	N	The Next Great Political SF Novel?	Orson Scott Card says in the afterword to &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; that this book is as different from &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; as &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; was from &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.  He's right.  Where &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; turned and looked at the universe 3000 years hence and examined, in great detail, religion and life, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; turns and looks at political interplay and fear in this world 150 years from now.<br />What made &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; stand out for me was the political aspect of the novel.  Orson Scott Card has done a better job of painting national politics and intrigue across a worldwide scale better than any science fiction or fantasy writer I've seen since George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;.  The scope that he uses is very impressive as he takes the political action of the novel across most of the Asian continent and shows situations that are, on the whole, relatively plausible.<br />Card's work in blending national policy with personal motivation is very impressive.  However, there are a few small areas I quibble with.  I think that the world community he paints one hundred and fifty years hence is a little tainted by personal bitterness, both to the US and China.  Whether he meant it to or not, it does, to me, detract a bit from both the plausibilty of the book and the overall quality of the writing.  Likewise, while I am not a student of South and Southeast Asia, I question his wisdom in using just once source apiece - as he states in the afterword - when creating his India and Thailand circa 2150.  This fact appears rather obvious when reading characters' discussions of these two countries.  Card trys very hard to make the countries he creates plausible extrapolations of today's countries, and they suffer for these two reasons.  <br />Nonetheless, the novel is still a wonderful read.  Card takes a couple of classic premises for novels and blends them into a story that, if it occaisonally lacks for original plot twists, one that shows how well he grasps both individual struggle and national interplay.  <br />On  the individual side of the novel, Bean, Peter and Petra all take on additional depth in this novel and all three become characters that I am eager to read more about in the remaining two novels in Card's &quot;Shadow&quot; series.  As adolescents and teenagers, they are as believable as they were as children in &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;.  As people, they develop more depth to their character - especially Peter - and move in directions that are, if predictable, certainly arrived at unpredictably.  <br />In retrospect, what definitely stands out for me in this book, are the political machinations.  I'm sure that will be what primarily stands out one, five, or ten years from now.  Anyone with an interest in political struggle should read this book, as well as any Orson Scott Card fan who wants to see him successfully tackle new areas of writing.  While I do have minor reservations about the world as he creates it, I have none about the way his characters move it and move through it.	2001-01-02

I saw a reference to it the other day and I was surprised how vividly some of the stories still stuck out in my mind.  Sadly, I have read little of Silverberg's work, but this book definitely made me want to dig out more of his novellas and short stories.<br />The two that stuck out the most admittedly were those with ties closest to my interests: ancient history and invertebrate zoology.  The novella for which the book was named, &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;, sets the stage for what becomes a selection of wildly different and surprising stories.  In &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;, Silverberg does a surprisingly good job of meshing ancient history and culture clash with classic science fiction concepts and plot twists.  &quot;Homefaring&quot;, on the other hand, lays out most of the plot surprises right off and spends a great deal of time exploring the implications of the setting: a civilization of intelligent lobsters.  Aside from minor evolutionary-morphological quibbles, the story was a wondrously bizarre surprise.  The other three stories were equally as deft in mixing plot and setting, but possibly through my own prejudices, they don't stick nearly as well in my brain.<br />Silverberg discusses in his introduction that he enjoys working in the novella format and it really shows.  In all five stories, Silverberg really gets the chance to sit down and enjoy the worlds that he's working in.  Each have their own impressively creative spark that really make you wonder how one can come up with such ideas.<br />If you're looking for good, classic science fiction, then Silverberg's work is one that you should definitely pick up.  If you want a good example of what the genre has evolved from in the last twenty or thirty years, it is still well worht reading.  Either way, I think anyone looking to broaden their field of science fiction reading should try this book.	2000-12-20
US	52673767	R1HO91AJYK2Y4H	0520216369	978862680	Importing Diversity: Inside Japan's JET Program	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Not Just About JET...	David McConnell's book is a fascinating look at the JET Program.  It is not only exhaustive and comprehensive, it is also the only real look at the JET Program in an academic light.  However, that is not its only appeal.  The book digs into serious questions of how Japan sees itself with regards to the outside world and how the Japanese bureacracy works.  <br />McConnell essentially takes the JET Program as a case study behind the inner workings of the Ministries in the first two chapters of the book and shows how decisions are made in a practical sense in Japan.  He covers the formation of the program, the trobleshooting that was done, the improvements made and the reasons behind justifying the programs.  He even delves (a little) into the give and take between the different Ministries when it comes to issues like funding, jurisdiction and accountability.<br />McConnell also manages to establish an American viewpoint in his book, making it a useful work in the field of US-Japanese relations.  He looks at the problems and the successes of the Program through American eyes and helps give depth to issues that Americans and Japanese see completely differently.<br />So, yes, &quot;Importing Diversity&quot; is an incredibly useful tool for learning about the JET Program.  Anyone who is applying to the program should read it.  However, students and scholars of Japanese Politics, International Relations and Cutural Anthropology should read it as well.  It is not to be missed by anyone with an interest in modern Japan.	2000-12-18
