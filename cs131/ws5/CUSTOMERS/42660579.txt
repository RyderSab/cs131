It seems to be his forte, whereas he certainly cannot make the same claim for either American history, Church history, or theology.  With this book, it seems clear that the nativism evident in the United States during the 19th century is, sadly, alive and well.<br />Catholics in the American colonies prior to the Revolution were not exactly regarded as first-class citizens, especially in New England.  Even in Maryland, founded as a haven for Catholics, Catholics were stripped of the franchise as soon as they were outnumbered by Anglicans.  There was exactly ONE Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independance -- Charles Carroll of Carrollton -- and the author of the Declaration, Thomas Jefferson, held extremely negative attitudes toward the Catholic Church.<br />In reality, the Congregationalist Calvinists, the Evangelical wing of the Church of England, and the Masonic Lodge exercised far more power during colonial times (and the 19th century as well for that matter) than the Catholic Church EVER has throughout the entire history of America.<br />As far as the \\"mark of Cain\\"?  Lurid speculation based on bias with no supporting evidence.<br />This book is embarassing to the literate.  Negative stars.	2002-06-14

That is a plus.  There are not many other plusses. <br />The first victim?  The mentor of his main character.  Other victims?  Like in his previous books, young children.  Many readers may well have a difficulty with this aspect of the book. His ultimate villian was completely unbelievable, the motive was weak and the resolution non-existent.<br />The sub-plot involving the gambling difficulties of the main character's husband never did make sense to me, and did not significantly add to the overall development.<br />Certainly not the worst mystery writer I've encountered -- but certainly not the best either.	2002-06-14

The victim:  the young daughter of an officer with connections with (but not part of) the conspiracy.  Although written in 1998, the plot is extremely timely, in light of the events of the past year.<br />Like his first novel, the criminal investigator involved in the case is a woman with a seriously messed-up private life.  Such a convention is rapidly becoming stereotypical, and this might be off-putting to some readers.<br />For this reviewer, however, the book was weakened by an unsatisfactory ending and the use of children as victims, which I find distasteful.	2002-06-14

In this novel, Mr. Bean has provided the reader with a &quot;serial killer&quot; set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin not long after the real serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.  Also surprisingly relavant to the times are the indications of child abuse by church officials. <br />It is evident that Mr. Bean did, at one point live in Milwaukee as his descriptions of neighborhoods, etc. are quite true-to-life.  It is also evident that not all of his research was quite as good as it could be.  While towns, neighborhoods, and landmarks were quickly recognizable, his understanding of the hierarchy of the Church in Milwaukee was quite lacking.<br />I found the book itself to be dark and disturbing, albeit with believable secondary character development and a sympathetic main character.  I found the revelation of the actual murderer to be a bit unbelievable.<br />Four stars for a reasonable mystery; minus one for using children as victims.

The notion that virtually the entire Roman Curia fails to make the \\"Rapture\\" is insulting and offensive.

Although his period of ministry was relatively short, ending with martyrdom, the influence he had on the Church, not only in Carthage, but throughout the Christian world was profound.<br />In these two essays, Cyprian deals with the problems presented by the &quot;lapsed&quot; -- those Christians who, under threat of persecution, renounced their faith in some manner.  He also deals with the Unity of the Church under the authority of the See of Rome and the Successor of the Apostles.  Sometimes, Cyprian is eisegeted in such as fashion as to suggest that the North African church was independant of Rome.  Those who make such suggestions have simply not read nor understood Cyprian in his entirety.  While it is true that he was a man of strong passion and conviction -- and was not hesitant to criticize the Bishop of Rome -- Rome held his submission and his obedience -- even when he felt Rome was in error.<br />A lesson, perhaps, that modern-day Catholics might do well to emulate.<br />A wonderful, necessary addition to any serious student of Church History.	2001-10-25

He did not want the post, nor did he feel himself worthy for the honor.  This book was written partly as an apology as to why he did not wish for the honor -- and partly as an instruction manual as to how the clergy should behave, and how they should counsel and treat those who are in sin and/or who come to him for guidance.<br />Although, due to human sinfulness, the Church no longer speaks with a united voice, Christians of all backgrounds and faiths would benefit from this book.

Books	4	34	39	N	N	A reasoned and honest approach. . .	. . .demonstrating that even among extremely conservative evangelical Protestants, some ministers and scholars are beginning to realize that the extremely popular doctrine of pre-millenial dispensationalism (see the popularity of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series) was not the view of the early Church, was not the view of the Reformers, was not the view of the revivialists of the First Great Awakening -- and is, in fact, of recent and doctrinally dubious origins.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Woodrow's booklet will never sell as many copies as &quot;Left Behind&quot;! But, he can rest secure in the fact that he has tried his best to encourage and educate his fellow believers that Scripturally -- and historically --  there IS another answer.<br />(As a personal aside, I can attest that dispensational premillialism was unknown in 11th century France!)	2001-09-20

It takes a big man to admit that he was wrong, especially when such an admission will cost him &quot;friends&quot;, supporters, and financial remuneration.<BR>Mr. Woodrow is a big man for writing this book and admitting that he was unknowingly deceived by the pseudo-scholarship silliness put forward by Alexander Hislop. He is also a big man for withdrawing his previous book from print -- at enormous financial cost.<BR>No, Mr. Woodrow is not a Roman Catholic. Those that now accuse him of &quot;selling out to Rome&quot;, etc., seem to be more interested in spreading their polemic than researching the actual facts of the matter.<BR>Anyhow, this theologian congratulates Mr. Woodrow for his courage, his integrity, and his Christian witness -- even if there are details on which we would (sharply) disagree.	2001-08-29

This could have been done without recourse to hysterical nativism. Then his theories could have been judged on their own merit.<BR>But as it stands, there is little to debate. Most reasonable apologists, upon encountering so much polemic, won't bother to look for the actual theology, and will simply toss the book aside.<BR>Sounds like a good plan to me.	2001-08-29

The writing is poor at best, the characters are flat, the issues are cut-and-dried (ALL good vs ALL evil), and the plot is inane and unbelievable (even for Christians like myself who do believe in the Second Coming of Christ).<br />Even worse than the writing is the theology.  LaHaye and Jenkins espouse a particular form of pre-millenial dispensationalism which was absolutely unknown in the Early Church -- and absolutely unknown to the great Reformers as well.  They represent a peculiar brand of American fundamentalism (virtually unknown even to Protestants in other parts of the world) which has been prevelant for only the last 175 years or so.  Yet LaHaye and Jenkins portray this relatively recent, extreme minority view as THE norm for &quot;correct&quot; biblical interpretation.<br />If a prospective reader finds this genre interesting or entertaining, permit me to recommend CS Lewis's &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; (especially the third book) or Michael O'Brien's &quot;Father Elijah&quot;.   Don't waste your valuable time or money here.	2001-08-23

The entire relationship between Buck and Chlohe is Jr. High stuff.  Eating cookies at each other over the telephone?  Come on, guys -- you're supposed to be adults here!  And Buck?  A thirtysomething, world travelling, unbelieving virgin?  Sorry -- not likely in the 21st century.<br />Problem Two:  The theology is worse than the writing.  LaHaye and Jenkins have built their entire scenario around an extreme minority viewpoint (even for Protestants) restricted almost exclusively to the United States.  The average uninformed non-Christian reader is going to assume (wrongfully) that this viewpoint represents the Christian position -- and that's just not the case.<br />Problem Three:  The inherent anti-Catholicism of the authors begins to come to the fore in this volume.  The notion that the Pope is 'raptured' because he has become a theological Lutheran is not only insulting to Catholics -- but to Lutherans as well.  (These two bodies tend to share similar views on the interpretation of Revelation -- and LaHaye and Jenkins would be just as opposed to the Lutheran view as to the Catholic view).  The notion that most of the rest of worldwide Catholicism is NOT 'raptured' is just as insulting.  All LaHaye and Jenkins have done here is to demonstrate that they know very little about Catholicism -- except that they hate it!<br />I am less impressed by the second volume in this series than I was with the first volume.  Don't waste your time or money.	2001-08-23
US	42660579	RDUDKFT3W3RGC	1569470111	144685302	Stealing Heaven (The Hera Series)	Books	2	13	20	N	N	A good, but one-sided book. . .	. . .which doesn't present a balanced perspective -- OR the both sides of the story.<br />This is an entertaining (and at points, steamy) historical novel detailing the relationship between the great theologian Peter Abelard, and his much younger female student, the intelligent and witty Heloise.<br />In the 11th century, teachers in University were expected to be celibate (whether or not they were members of the clergy).  While not (to my best knowledge) a matter of canon law, such celibacy was a deeply ingrained custom.  Peter Abelard was neither the first nor the last teacher to throw such customs to the wind -- his case remains noticed because of the dreadful vengeance directed against him.<br />Yes, Abelard violated custom by his affair with Heloise.  However, any work which would portray Abelard as a ruthless aggressor and  Heloise as an innocent victim are reading their own 20th and 21st century feminist perspectives into an 11th century situation.  Both individuals were adults, both were consenting, both were aware of the customs and social mores, and both were aware of the possible penalties.  This work does the relationship a great disservice by suggesting otherwise.<br />The real villian in this story is Heloise' uncle.  Here was a man who engaged in his own extended sexual dalliances, and who took a personal vengeance against the greatest teacher in Paris -- a vengeance in which the punishment did NOT fit the crime, and which caused untold harm to the University.<br />Finally, the author includes a strong undercurrent of homosexuality throughout the novel.  I remain unconvinced that this was necessary.  First, she accuses Abelard of numerous homosexual encounters with his students -- an accusation which flies in the face of the best history we have, which states that Abelard did indeed keep his celibacy until his meeting with Heloise.  Second, her descriptions of rampant lesbianism in the various convents in which Heloise found herself was unnecessary tothe story and another historical liberty.<br />I enjoyed this book (and the movie, for that matter) but the pure student of church history will realize that the author's agendas play a much larger role in this novel than is strictly appropriate.	2001-08-18

Fascicle 1 (English and Latin Edition)	Books	5	19	21	N	N	A &quot;must read&quot; for anyone. . .	. . .who wishes to understand the perspective of Peter Abelard.<br />Peter Abelard is possibly one of the most misunderstood theologians of the entire High Middle Ages.  Unfortunately, he is primarily remembered for his love affair with his equally brillian student Heloise -- and the fearsome revenge exacted upon him by her angry uncle.<br />It is unfair to remember only this!  Abelard was a brilliant theologian and a brilliant teacher at one of the most renowned universities of his day (the University of Paris).<br />Sic et Non, arguably Abelard's greatest work, is his demonstration (much to the chagrin of the ecclesiastical authorities of his day) that the Early Church Fathers did NOT agree on all issues, and that it was possible (indeed, quite easy) to use the Fathers to argue against the Fathers.<br />It grieves me that more scholarly attention is not given to Abelard.	2001-08-14
