On the surface, the book has a very commercial feel, and I read it cover-to-cover in two sittings. It's a great yarn about growing up and the dysfunctionalism of adolescence. But there are a myriad of deeper layers to this story. It's a discussion of class in American culture. It's a narrative analysis of feminine deference inside male systems. It's a sociological deconstruction of clicks. And Lee Fiora, the prep schooler through whose eyes we watch everything, is one of the most complex and nuanced teenagers you'll find in literature. <br /> <br />Honestly, PREP was a book I read way back in August in manuscript form; however, I didn't really appreciate it until after I finished Tom Wolfe's I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS a couple weeks ago. You don't realize how well Curtis Sittenfeld nails the voice in PREP until you read a book in which someone completely misses the mark. There are books where the author takes on the persona of the teen protagonist--Salinger of course, PREP, Tom Perrotta's JOE COLLEGE, even to a lesser extent DBC Pierre's VERNON GOD LITTLE (a decent but not great book, no matter what the Booker Prize committee said). Then there are books that sound like a 70-year-old man pretending he remotely has a clue about the culture and social norms of today's young people. I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is most definitely the latter. <br /> <br />Pick up a copy of PREP. Recommend it to your friends. Put down your Bret Easton Ellis, your Hunter S. Thompson, your Dave Eggers--Because I think you could be staring at the next big generational novel.	2005-02-08

Then there are books that sound like a 70-year-old man pretending he remotely has a clue about the culture and social norms of today's teens. I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is most definitely the latter. <br /> <br />The latest by Tom Wolfe misses the mark in almost every conceivable way. He doesn't know how today's kids talk, act or interact with their peers. It's one of the more disappointing novels I've read in 5-6 years. If Wolfe's name isn't attached to it, this manuscript doesn't see the light of day.	2005-02-02

On that day a half-century ago the 4-minute mile was finally, irrevocably broken. They said it couldn't be done, that it was beyond the scope of human endurance. Even as the 20th century wound down, this penultimate event was treated with a hallowed reverence; Sports Illustrated chose the 4-minute mile--the perfect mile--as The Greatest Sporting Achievement of the Century.<br />On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the perfect mile, and with the Summer Olympic Games in Athens only weeks away, THE PERFECT MILE by Neil Bascomb couldn't be any timelier.  And with the movie adaptation of THE PERFECT MILE currently in production with Universal, Spyglass--the same studio that produced a little movie called SEABISCUIT--expect this book to have a loooooong shelf life. <br />Speaking of SEABISCUIT, Neil Bascomb has a charismatic narrative voice not unlike Laura Hillenbrand's. In THE PERFECT MILE, he weaves together the biographies of three amazing and strikingly different athletes--Bannister, the Oxford-educated amateur sports-for-sports-sake archetype with his come-from-behind running style; Landy, the Aussie with the unorthodox training methods, and a relentless wire-to-wire front runner; and lastly Santee, the American, a tough Kansas-born farmer's son that history forgot. <br />Three men, one quest: The Perfect Mile. <br />READ THIS BOOK, PEOPLE!!!	2004-05-04

Each chapter is a self-contained story, with divergent and seemingly random settings--Haiti in the dictatorial 1960s, Manhattan in the 1970s, Brooklyn and Queens in the 21st century. And yet slowly, irrevocably, the reader is drawn into the shared love, the shared remorse, the shared history, the shared hope, the shared rebellions--both personal and political--that circle round this unassuming man...this husband...this father...this friend...this torturer...this dew breaker.<br />About three-quarters of the way into THE DEW BREAKER I couldn't see myself giving it anything more than 3-1/2 or 4 stars. This is a book that rewards patience, one whose ultimate purity is not realized until the very last sentence, when that &quot;pendulum between regret and forgiveness&quot; swings one last time. Given what's going on even as we speak in the island nation of Haiti, THE DEW BREAKER's timeliness is nearly as haunting as Ms. Danticat's prose. Maybe this isn't a book for everyone...but it should be. <br />Postscript: I bought the audio edition of THE DEW BREAKER after I read the print book. For those of you who find yourself tripping over some of the Creole dialect in print, try the audio. The narrator, Robin Miles, is an extraordinary talent.	2004-03-10

Ever wonder how it is that you're not about to sit down for tea and crumpets, looking forward to your wife cooking you a dinner of stuffed cow intestines? Don't laugh.

The Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam have all been captured memorably, but the American Revolution seems to resists cinematic treatment. More than any other book, 'Washington's Crossing' provides the opportunity to correct this strange oversight, for in a confined chronological space we have the makings of both 'Patton' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' starring none other than George Washington. Fischer has provided the script. And it's all true.&quot;<br />David Hackett Fischer has indeed done that, Mr. Ellis. And the canon of Revolutionary War literature has a new cornerstone	2004-02-17

The buzz surrounding the acquisition of this title was huge: 7-figure deal, movie rights sold, six-figure first printing, etc...then the reviews, ranging from awful to average, started coming in. The characters are two-dimensional, the story arc bloated, and the conclusion so implausible that by the final pages the book's already tenuous credibility vanishes--much like the three hours of my life that I'll never get back reading this amateurish effort. Seven figures? For this book? There's a publisher about to take a serious bath on this turkey.<br />Edit: I see this book is now on track to sell a whopping ONE-TENTH of its announced hardcover first printing of 250,000.

TWELVE answers that question with a resounding YES. It IS compelling and highly readable; it is NOT great literature if the author's age is taken out of the equation. <br />Without the author's connections, this book would be justifably relegated to some obscure advanced writing course to perhaps be resurrected as an infinitely better novel 10 years from now when Nick McDonell's skills as a writer had matured. As it stands, the book was published, whether we like it or not. <br />About the highest complement I could pay TWELVE is that it was far less of a waste of my time than either Stephen Carter's EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK or Jean Auel's SHELTERS OF STONE. A literary wunderkind like Nick McDonell falling short but showing promise is far more inspiring to me than two supposedly \\"mature\\" writers producing two of the most overrated, unwieldy \\"editor challenged\\" pieces of ... in the history of commercial fiction.	2002-07-16

Maybe the fact that I had just read Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT prior to picking up a copy of A THOUSAND COUNTRY ROADS negatively influenced my opinion of the book. Like it or not however, when an author like Ian McEwan transports a reader in a way he hasn't been transported by fiction in the last 10 years, you tend to raise the bar for everyone else. And whereas ATONEMENT showing up on the New York Times bestseller list almost singlehandedly restored my faith in the reading tastes of the American public, A THOUSAND COUNTRY ROADS popularity will most likely vanquish it. <br />Waller has been and always will be a bad writer. His over-the-top, hypersentimental prose reads like a bad Hallmark card that someone tried to awkwardly mold into a novel. An argument can be made that THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY was classic escapist literature--a book that juxtaposed the cold, austere mood of the time with something sweet, flighty and tragically romantic.

Being born and raised Roman Catholic in America, I'm well aware of the personal struggles faced by Roman Catholics who are torn between institutional Catholicism as preached by the Vatican and personal Catholicism as espoused by the majority of Roman Catholic parishes in America. <br />This book tries to paint the Roman Catholic Church in broad brushstrokes as dogmatic and overbearing, and quite frankly I would agree that the upper echelons of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, especially under the restrictive policies of Paul VII and John Paul II, are all that and more. However, what this book fails to address--which is a typical mistake of the proverbial outsider looking in--is that the Roman Catholic Church in America has survived in direct proportion to the independence its parishes and pastors are given. The Church survives because most priests are left alone by the Vatican to address the individual needs of their parishoners. And within the context of this relationship, an inverted pyramid of power has slowly supplanted the former pyramidial hierarchy that placed the Holy See at the top. The \\"Vicar of Christ\\" has become more of a symbolic figurehead, and we as Roman Catholics--AMERICAN Catholics--will admit to as much if you back us into a corner.<br />Ultimately, if the message this book preaches was really all that attractive, then a pragmatism-first-Christianity-second \\"Catholic light\\" religion like Episcopalianism would be the rule rather than the exception, and Roman Catholicism wouldn't be the single largest Christian denomination on the globe. And this is coming from a complete pro-birth control, pro-choice, gay-friendly left winger who thinks priests should be allowed to marry and that women should be allowed in the priesthood, so don't start throwing the labels on me.	2002-04-02

For my liberal bretheren to summarily dismiss Mr. Goldberg's BIAS without any credible argument to the contrary--which almost every negative BIAS review contained herein manages to do--simply confirms his message. <br />Whether you choose to believe it or not, the liberal media bias has always been the proverbial elephant in the living room: it's huge, it's obvious, but nobody wants to talk about it.

Brand's THE FIRST AMERICAN is a superb recent example.) Mr. Ellis' FOUNDING BROTHERS manages to be that \\"perfect\\" history, but in the span of an exceedingly accessible 300 or so pages. Without in any way debunking our Founding Fathers, Mr. Ellis has succeeded in doing what no text has done before; that is, he has taken these great men off a picture on a wall and created (for better or worse) real flesh-and-blood \\"politicans\\" that we can relate to on a 21st-century level. <br />The audio version--which by the way is produced by Recorded Books--makes the subject matter even more accessible.
