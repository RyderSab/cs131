With credentials like those, she obviously knows her physics. So the only real question is, can she write readably on the subject. And I think she can -- mostly. I certainly understand more about modern concepts like string theory, supergravity, and the ideas of 10- and 11-dimensional spacetimes that physicists are using now than I did before reading the book. While some points are still not clear, it is hard to tell whether this is because they are too complex for anyone but a  practicing physicist to understand or because Prof. Randall still hasn't explained them thoroughly enough. And I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt there. <br /> <br />Her format derives, it seems, from the type of book that George Gamow wrote describing relativity and quantum mechanics using the adventures of the fictional character, Mr. Tompkins. One difference is that, in this book, the story is a relatively minor part and the physics takes up the bulk of the book, the reverse of Gamow's books. In fact, one can probably ignore the story and get most of what Prof. Randall has to say. Though it is somewhat interesting to follow her characters, Icarus and Athena Rushmore (and she obviously chose her characters' names with care; Icarus is a devil-may-care type who dies in an accident while Athena, his younger sister, is the smart one who loves owls! I wonder if Randall intends Athena to represent herself.) <br /> <br />I mostly liked the book; as I say, I don't think I understand _everything_ yet, but I know a lot more than I did before I opened the book. If you have an interest in the subject matter of this book, I recommend that you read it.	2005-09-09

The book is a good introduction to the principles of historical linguistics, with many clear examples of the techniques used by linguists in tracking back the history of languages. Examples are primarily from English, Latin/Romance, and, oddly enough, Basque.    Trask is an American-born linguist teaching in the United Kingdom, and his treatment of developments in the history of the English language is very good. He must also be expert in Basque, as many examples in the book are from Basque and its dialects.    One very good thing about the book is that he does not try to impose his own opinions on the reader on topics where linguists are not all in agreement. Thus, he presents the ideas of linguists with whom he disagrees on some of the phyletic relationships among the world's languages, and presents both their arguments and those of their opponents, without putting down the ideas which he does not accept. This level of open-mindedness in a field which still has many controversies is a very strong point in this book.    However, if this book is to be used for self-study, rather than as a classroom textbook, it suffers from the fact that each chapter ends with a number of exercises, none of which has answers given. And you can't really be sure you're thinking the way the author wants you to without the answer guide. Perhaps there is an \\"instructor's version\\" that has those answers, but if so, that is the one you need to get. This set of exercises without answers is what took my rating down a notch.	2005-09-03

As another reviewer has pointed out, he does not succeed very well in the latter goal, but in the rest of his goals he succeeds very well. <br /> <br />The book is quite thick and will not read quickly, but there is a lot of interesting material in it. I'm not very fond of his organization, where he has a chapter on the standard language followed by an \\"interlude\\" on nonstandard varieties, but at least he gets to cover both that way. <br /> <br />I would recommend the book, but not so whole-heartedly that I'd give it a top rating.	2005-09-02

The author does not try to go back to the very beginning of language itself, but takes his story from the point where words already existed, but most grammatical structure had not yet evolved, still before any language of which a record survives. <br /> <br />The author uses examples in present-day languages to illustrate processes in linguistic evolution that are currently taking place or have taken place recently enough to be well documented. This lends a lot of credibility to his ideas. <br /> <br />Because the author was born in Israel (presumably having modern Israeli Hebrew as his first language) and has become a specialist in Semitic historical linguistics, he presents more examples from Semitic languages than one often sees in popular linguistics books intended for the English-language reader, but it is all written in a very easily understood way, and I find the book as readable as if it had been written by a native speaker of English, though with a few signs that the English which the author learned was more British than American.  <br /> <br />There is only one negative comment I would make, and that does not sufficiently detract from the value of the book that I would deny it a 5-star rating: I wish that the author would more clearly separate his own personal speculations from the ideas which are believed by the majority of linguistics professionals. It is clear that a lot of the ideas presented in this book are the author's own, but it is not clear how many.	2005-06-06

Just days apart, two books came out on the same subject. This book competes with Michael Downing's \\"Spring Forward\\" and, in my opinion, wins the competition. <br /> <br />For one thing, the background history of timekeeping goes back further in Prerau's book than in Downing's. And it is placed in a more logical place in the book. Additionally, this book is, in my opinion, better written, reading in a way that holds my interest better. Prerau also uses maps and illustrations intelligently. <br /> <br />In addition, Downing seems not to have thoroughly proofread his book, occasionally writing \\"east\\" instead of \\"west\\" and \\"latitude\\" instead of \\"longitude.\\" <br /> <br />For all these reasons, although both books pretty much cover the same material, unless you have a great desire to have both books in your library, this one is the one to buy.	2005-05-02

As it happens, two very similar books came out only days apart, this one and David Prerau's \\"Seize the Daylight\\". If I didn't have Prerau's book to compare with this one, I might have rated this one higher; but Prerau's is so much better than this book that I cannot give a 5-star rating to this book. <br /> <br />Both books give some background history of timekeeping. Prerau's goes back to ancient days and covers the previous changes from temporal hours to equal hours, from apparent to mean time, and from mean local to standard time. Downing's book starts at a later point, and also devotes less space to the details, as well as putting this material in a flashback chapter, which makes for inferior organization. <br /> <br />In addition, I find this book is not written as well as Prerau's, which does a better job of holding my interest, and in addition, Downing makes a number of minor (but significant) errors such as writing \\"latitude\\" when he means \\"longitude\\" or \\"east\\" when he means \\"west.\\" This causes a bit of difficulty on some occasions. <br /> <br />I cannot say I didn't enjoy this book, but I liked Prerau's better.	2005-05-02

I think this book is one of the best of the set. <br /> <br />The author attempts to write the book at a level accessible to someone with a very small background in mathematics, even nearly omitting the use of calculus (though he finds that he cannot totally omit calculus). I can't easily put myself in the place of his intended reader, since my mathematical background is rather better than that, but I still think this book is better at putting a highly abstruse mathematical topic within reach of the general public than most authors can manage. <br /> <br />The book melds history with mathematics, I think quite successfully, giving the reader a chance to learn about some of the people involved as well as learning what interests mathematicians so much about the Riemann hypothesis. <br /> <br />If you are not math-phobic, you might like this book. try it!	2004-12-15

Hamilton's creation of the algebra of quaternions, while an important mathematical innovation, was thought of in many minds as primarily a physical tool, to be used in many of the applications that today are done by vectorial methods (and, in fact, the terms \\"scalar\\" and \\"vector\\" were invented by Hamilton, but with slightly different meanings than their present ones). Grassmann developed a quite different system, much closer to our present vector algebra, but unrecognized because of his obscurity and his books' unreadability. The true founders of modern vector analysis were the American physical chemist Josiah Willard Gibbs and the British physicist Oliver Heaviside, working independently of each other. What is interesting is that both Gibbs and Heaviside arrived at identical systems by modifying Hamilton's quaternion algebra to make it more accurately reflect the needs of physical scientists. While both Gibbs and Heaviside started with Hamilton's methods, the system they both arrived at was closer to Grassmann's in structure. And all this is clearly put forth in Crowe's book. <br /> <br />One other thing that the book makes clear is that J. Willard Gibbs, far more humbly than most scientists involved in priority disputes, clearly recognized that Grassmann had anticipated his ideas, although Grassmann's books had not come to Gibbs' attention until Gibbs had completely worked out his own system. And Gibbs, though he had based his ideas on Hamilton's, also recognized that Grassmann had the superior approach. (Though this may have NOT been a sign of humility, because in this regard Gibbs ended up using Grassmann's ideas to justify his own.)  <br /> <br />Crowe's book is very readable, makes all these points quite clearly, and is highly recommended if you are interested in the subject.	2004-10-29

I've earlier reviewed another book by the same author on the same subject: \\"Real Choices/ New Voices,\\" as well as another book on the same subject, \\"Electoral Systems: A Comparative Introduction,\\" by David M. Farrell. I gave the first one 4 stars, and the second 5, which poses a problem. I really want to show this book as a lot better than Amy's other book, but still not up to the Farrell book. But I cannot give it 4 1/2 stars, so you'll have to note, if you read this review, that I certainly mean to rank it higher than the 4 star figure I gave it, but the existence of Farrell's excellent book precludes my giving it a full 5 stars. <br /> <br />Amy states in this book that most proportional representation (PR) advocates fail to acknowledge the negatives of PR and only mention its good points. What he fails to reveal in this comment is that Amy himself, in his other book, is guilty of this! This book, by contrast, is far more balanced, and this makes it a much better book than Amy's other one. <br /> <br />I would certainly be more inclined to recommend this book, as giving a more balanced treatment of different voting systems and their advantages and disadvantages than \\"Real Choices/ New Voices.\\"  However, the very best book on this subject I've seen, excluding a long out of print book by Lakeman and Lambert, is \\"Electoral Systems: A Comparative Introduction.\\" David M. Farrell does such a good job that it has to be the top recommendation, with this book somewhat behind.

It has a good introduction to group theory, which is the principal branch of mathematics that deals with the topics needed to understand symmetry, and it covers some types of symmetries usually neglected, like color symmetry. It's not at a very high level, which is good if you're starting off, but not if you already have a good dose of the necessary material. In other words, this is an introductory book and will not satisfy you if you are looking for a more advanced text, but I recommend it as a first book.	2004-07-09

But how about the best centerfielder? Mantle, or DiMaggio? In my lifetime, I've been a fan of both, so either one might qualify... and yet, whichever you leave out, you're leaving out one of the Yankees' greatest players. By restricting your all-time best Yankee team to one at each position, you're forced to choose, and yet, at other positions (like left field or third base), the best one you can find is nowhere near the SECOND-best centerfielder. (I'm assuming, when I talk of left fielders, you consider Babe Ruth a RIGHT fielder, as Neyer does: he played left on the road and right in Yankee Stadium!)<br />I'm sure there are similar problems with other teams; I know the Yankees best, so I gave Yankee examples. But this is the problem with any book of this type. <br />Still, it's fun to look at the lists in this book. I'm not sorry I bought it. 4 stars, yes... but certainly not 5.	2004-05-01

Sure, I liked it a lot, but it does need some negative comments here. But I decided I liked it enough to give it 5.<br />At first, I felt that the book was not as well integrated as I'd like. With further reading it grew on me. McWhorter covers a lot of topics in comparative/historical linguistics, and does so in a very readable style, but the breadth of his coverage seemed to me at first to be just too great. As I said, as I read further, I changed my mind somewhat. I still think that it could be somewhat better integrated, but I think it's not as badly integrated as I first thought.<br />One thing that I can fault McWhorter on is that if you have read his other book, &quot;The Word on the Street,&quot; you'll find him repeating some of his ideas. They aren't at the same level of prominence: major theses he advances in the earlier book become minor points here. But it does seem he could at least change his examples. He gives the SAME example of a sentence that is traditionally considered ungrammatical which everyone naturally uses, and the SAME example of a passage in Shakespeare that is universally misunderstood because of semantic change over time, that he used in the other book. But he's not as bad as Keith Devlin, who has published popularizations of math with whole chapters taken verbatim from earlier books. So again, I can't fault McWhorter that much.<br />Other than these two comments, however, I have only positive things to say. I think that this book is a good treatment of historical and comparative linguistics, of dialect variation and pidgin/creole structure, and such at a level accessible to the interested general public. And so I recommend it to all interested readers.	2004-03-15

Jo Ellen Barnett has written two books here, hidden between one set of covers. The first part goes over the history of how we have measured (and, truly, how we have defined) the time of day, starting with the &quot;temporary hours&quot; of a sundial (longer in summer, shorter in winter, and not even counted during the night), and transitioning to equal (but still based on the sun) hours (local apparent time), then to local mean time, to standard (time-zone) time, and ending up with the current Coordinated Universal Time, based on atomic phenomena. The story is absorbing and well written, and would be an enjoyable book all by itself.<br />Then she has a second part, concerned with the way we have determined the age of the earth. This could be said to start with the speculations of the Babylonians and Greeks, but really took off in earnest with medievals' attempts to build everything on a Biblical basis, reading into the Biblical account whatever they needed to build their chronology. When the geologists tried to account for their own observations, however, it was clear that the few thousand years the Bible literalists derived for the age of the earth was far too small, but physicists like Lord Kelvin (while arriving at a longer time than the Bible provided) still reached an age of the earth too brief to mesh with the geological evidence. Only with the discovery of radioasctivity and the refinement of the techniques of deriving chronological data from radioactivity measurements could the physicists and geologists be reconciled.<br />Both parts make it clear that ultimately time has become defined in terms of atomic phenomena (though different parts of the atom) and only through our measurement of these can accuracy be attained (whether in the case of the time of day or the time the earth has taken to evolve since its origin).<br />Unlike some other two-part books I have reviewed, this one puts them both together successfully. It is a very interesting book.	2004-03-10

S. Government) and on the Circuit Court for the D. C. Circuit (the level just below the Supreme Court), both of which gave him a reason to interact directly with the Justices of the Supreme Court.<br />While Starr goes back to the beginning, especially the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison, where the Supreme Court first asserted its right to make the ultimate decision as to what is constitutionally permitted and what is not, his primary focus is on the recent history of the Court, after the death of Earl Warren. He goes into what the Court has decided in the Burger and Rehnquist years, and even more importantly, the judicial philosophies of the Justices who have served in these years, and how those philosophies caused them to decide cases the way they have.<br />The book ends with the 2000 election and the Bush v. Gore decision, which overruled what many feel was an unjustified Florida Supreme Court decision and paved the way for George W. Bush's inauguration as President. This part of the book may be controversial to some, but it certainly shows that Bush v. Gore was well within the envelope of the kind of decision the Court has made in the past, despite protests by Gore partisans that the Court was acting politically.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in how the Supreme Court functions today.	2004-03-10

If I had written this book, I would have included at least the following for each unit: (1) All other units in the SAME system (i. e., if we are talking about a pre-revolutionary French unit of length, all other pre-revolutionary French units of length)  and (2) the nearest-sized SI unit. Unfortunately they frequently leave out conversions between units of the same system that would be useful, and often units of the same approximate size are converted to different SI units, making comparisons difficult. (For example, one foot-size unit may be expressed as so many centimeters, while another as such a fraction of a meter.)<br />Both of these omissions can be circumvented by using a calculator and working with what these authors have chosen to include, but the book would be easier to use if they had done what I would have.	2004-02-27

It provides samples of the scripts used for most of the important languages of the world, but not all. There are some errors (a newspaper illustrated to show the Hebrew alphabet used for writing Yiddish is described as being published in the wrong place, as I, who can read Yiddish, could easily determine) but it is more accurate than a lot of other books on the subject.<br />The book is slim, and talks of writing systems more than languages. Thus &quot;Russian script&quot; really means Cyrillic and includes all the languages that use Cyrillic script. It is not a book to learn a language from, but rather a reference on alphabets, and for that purpose, I think a good but not great one.<br />The author does appear to be somewhat obsessed with newspapers. If a script is used for writing newspapers, it is important to the author; otherwise not. And for every script, the author gives an approximate count of the newspapers published using that writing system. But this is hardly a serious flaw.<br />This is not a perfect book on the subject, but it is one I liked. So I certainly recommend it.	2004-02-21

It is one of only a couple of books for which I was ever willing to pay that much money, and that alone should be a clue as to how much I liked it.<br />There are chapters on most of the important languages of the world, as well as some of the language families that include these languages. Each chapter is by a different expert (actually, a few people wrote more than one chapter), and so there is some unevenness in the treatment. But in general, each of the single-language chapters gives a relatively detailed summary of the grammar and vocabulary of the language it covers; the language-family chapters describe the common features of languages in the family. The level of detail is not that of a textbook in the language, but rather enough to give someone like myself (interested in linguistics, but not fluent in anything but my own native English) a good feeling for how the language works.<br />The first book of this type that I ever saw was Mario Pei's &quot;The World's Chief Languages.&quot; This book goes into more detail on any individual language than Pei's book did, but covers a smaller number of languages (though more varied ones). It belongs in the library of anyone who wants to know a little bit of how a lot of languages work.	2004-02-21

I'm taking literally the definition &quot;5 = I love it!&quot; and on that basis this book cannot get 5 stars, though I can't say exactly _what_ I don't quite like.<br />The book does a good job of taking the reader through the steps needed to explain &quot;why the calculus works&quot; -- and it really doesn't require calculus to understand most of this book, though you need calculus to understand the _motivation_ for a lot of what the book does. You need only have a decent grounding in high school geometry and algebra to understand the book. Still, it isn't an _easy_ read. I've found myself putting the book down and coming back to it later several times. Yet I can't say that the book is hard to read because it's badly written; I think it's written decently well. I think it's just that the topics it covers are harder going than a lot of the math I read.<br />So, while I don't _love_ this book, I'd recommend it to someone who wants to know something about the motivation for all those weird epsilons and deltas and the non-intuitive definitions of topics like continuity. It does that job, and does it as well as any book I know of.	2004-01-29

It covers things like dimensional analysis and the effect of choice of units on physical formulas, as well as the history of units (as promised in the title), but it jumps from topic to topic in a chaotic manner, with topics that are closely related scattered among different chapters and things that ought to be separated lumped together in one chapter.<br />Another reviewer talked of the errors in some of the equations in this book.

For those who do not know what this number is, it can be defined in many ways, but the simplest is as the number which, when it is squared, is increased by 1. The fact that all the other definitions gives the same number is the reason for its great interest among recreational mathematics fans.<br />The biggest problem with this book is that it tries to do two different things. One of the &quot;two books&quot; that I see in this one is about the _mathematical_ properties of the golden ratio. And this part of the book covers a lot of ground, and as a result I like it very much, as one of the few recreational math books I've seen recently that is easy to read yet still teaches me something I didn't know before I read it. The other part, however, is simply a refutation of claims made by many people that this or that artist consciously employed the golden ratio in his work. And it's interesting at first, but becomes tedious as he marshals more and more evidence refuting these claims. If the book confined itself to a discussion of the mathematical properties of the golden section (which is intimately related to such things as the Fibonacci sequence, Penrose tilings, and quasi-crystals), it would have merited 5 stars from me. But the attempt to refute all the artistic claims causes it to bog down for me, and causes me to cut one star off.<br />One thing that totally puzzles me is his terminological decision to use &quot;phi&quot; rather than &quot;tau.&quot; Since &quot;phi&quot; comes from a tribute to Phidias (a famous Greek architect/sculptor) and one of the points of the book is that neither Phidias nor his contemporary Greeks actually used the number in their designs, his statement that he uses &quot;phi&quot; to conform with most recreational mathbooks is strange. I would, as I have said, gone with &quot;tau,&quot; which was the earlier-introduced symbol and has the merit of coming from the initial of the Greek word for &quot;section&quot; (in keeping with the term &quot;golden section&quot; for this number).	2004-01-14

This is one example of the kind of history that can be informative and yet hold the reader's attention, though I admit it is a subject that has interested me a lot anyway.  <br />The book's primary thrust is the history leading to the fact that we do not normally use the metric system in the U. S. I must say that it makes a good case for an idea that I'd never run across before: that this is primarily because the French, in devising the definition of the meter, departed from an idea that many people, including Thomas Jefferson, thought would give the most internationally reproducible standard. Reading this book, it really seems he has his facts right, and his argument is convincing.<br />I found that the book clarified a number of points that I have wondered about.<br />One negative thing is that his appendix in the end has some (probably typographical) errors: one table shows 101, 102, etc. for what slould really be 10 with exponents 1, 2, etc.) and in several other tables, &quot;grains&quot; becomes &quot;gains.&quot;	2003-12-29

Clegg covers both the concept of infinity and its companion, the concept of infinitesimal, from Greek days to the present, in a way I found very readable. I have very little to complain about except that I found it sometimes frustrating that his treatment oversimplified and didn't give enough details.<br />(For example, he has a chapter on Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis. I think that, next to Cantor, Robinson's ideas are probably the most important on the subject of anyone who has worked in it, yet I felt I did not get an adequate picture of Robinson's ideas of infinity and infinitesimals from the chapter.)<br />Still, it is the best book on the subject at a &quot;popular&quot; level I have seen.	2003-12-29

About two months ago, I reviewed &quot;Understanding Map Projections&quot; by Melita Kennedy and Steve Kopp. While in certain minor ways this book falls short of Kennedy and Kopp's book, it is generally head and shoulders above it. And while it is true that Snyder's book is almost twice the price of Kennedy and Kopp's book, it is worth it. Other books of comparable value cost much more.<br />The only negative thing I really have to say about Snyder's book is that he tries to do two different things in it. This book is both a history and a survey of map projections, and what is appropriate for a history may not be best for a survey. In particular, it means that Snyder covers the various projections not in a sensible order (grouping similar types together), but chronologically. Projections popularized, say, in the 19th century are all covered in the same section.<br />I prefer the organization of Kennedy and Kopp's book, and I think the use of color in that book makes for a more attractive book. But my primary rating of a book on map projections is going to be based on three criteria: (1) Does it cover a large variety of different projections? (2) Does it give illustrations of what they look like? and (3) Does it give formulas or other information by which one can actually construct maps on the projections listed? This book ranks much higher than Kennedy and Kopp's on two of these three criteria (the first and last), and does not fall very far short of it on the remnaining one.<br />Over a hundred projections (actually, close to twice that many) are treated in this book, from familiar ones to novelty projections that never will be used in a serious atlas. And a large proportion of them are illustrated (though not all, and the ones that are do not use color as in the Kennedy &amp; Kopp book) and either have the formulas for plotting them or are described in terms equivalent to giving formulas (By contrast the Kennedy-Kopp book has almost no formulas, and the descriptions do not allow you to produce them).<br />If you don't want to spend over $50, this is the one map projection book to buy.ns do not allow you to produce them). <br />If you don't want to spend over $50, this is the one map projection book to buy.	2003-12-17
US	28406807	R3JKEY0NBC5MY7	0271020016	307504743	Vulgar Latin	Books	5	31	31	N	Y	An excellent book	Many of us have some exposure to Classical Latin. Some of us had it in school, others have other exposure. But the thing that we tend to forget about Classical Latin is that just about nobody spoke it and only a few were able to write it. The language that Latin-speakers actually used was the one described here.<br />\\"Vulgar Latin\\" (a name that the author doesn't really like, even if he uses it for reasons of its being the best-known name for it) was the normal speech of the Latin speaking world, and as a result, the language that developed into modern French, Spanish, Italian, and the other Romance languages. If you want to know more about the history of those languages, you should read a book such as this one.<br />It is hard to tell how much of what I like about this book is due to its author and how much to the translator. The book was originally written in French in the 1960s, and an updated version (written also in French, but not published) was used as the basis both for a Spanish translation in the 1990s and for this one. Prof. Herman states in his own preface that his original French was turned into a much more readable English style by Prof. Wright, who is himself a professor of Romance languages in England. In consequence, much of the extreme readability of this book seems to be the translator's contribution.<br />In any case, I found the book informative, while yet relatively easy to read. There is not much about a book that can be considered negative when it is both of these. Thus, it deserves the highest rating.	2003-10-24

Unlike Sabato's book, however, it is \\"The Insiders' View.\\" That is to say, it was produced from a conference attended by many of the principals: Gore workers, Bush workers, and media workers. And I found it interesting as a guide to what the people were thinking as they managed the two campaigns and the media coverage.

Where it is good, it gets a high score, but it cannot be rated 5-star in my opinion because of a serious lack of what I consider important information.<br />First, the good part. The book is very attractive; most map projection books stick to black and white line drawings illustrating projections and geometric properties, but this book uses color in a very helpful way. It also provides its information in a well-organized manner; each of the projections it describes has a page devoted to it, with an illustration depicting the projection (usually a world map if the projection is well-adapted to that purpose, or a map of Antarctica if the projection is better suited to smaller areas), a list of some of the important properties of the projection, and some information on where it is used.<br />My strongest negative criticism is related to the fact that the authors seem not to be sure how much mathematics the reader considers comfortable. Thus there are equations giving the transformation of coordinates from one geographic system to another, but not the equations that define the various projections; and I think these equations are really necessary in a book of this type.<br />The other criticism that I have is that the computer program used to draw the illustrative maps of the projections has too low a resolution, at least in the case of the world maps. (The maps of Antarctica seem all right.) Thus a lot of the lines have the kind of jaggedness that comes from this insufficient resolution.<br />I suppose &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; as this book is much less expensive than other map projection books, but I'm particularly disappointed because there are so many good things about this book.	2003-10-10

I tend to look at elementary books like this one from the point of someone who doesn't need to learn from it but might want to use it as a text if teaching or tutoring someone. I learned almost nothing from this book, but I didn't expect to, as it's all material I learned ages ago. But for someone encountering this material for the first time, this would be an excellent book.<br />I see this book as used primarily in a pre-calculus math class or for tutoring someone about to take calculus. It gives a good exposition of material that will be encountered at the time a student takes calculus, but at a level that assumes the student has only the algebra that most students entering a calculus course have taken. And from that point, it explains the elements of drawing graphs of algebraic functions and the ideas of tangency that are so critical to differential calculus, and does so in a clear way, with helpful diagrams. It is a slim book, and probably by itself could not be the only text in a pre-calculus math class, but on the subjects it covers, it is the best I have seen. (And that is underrating it, because there aren't many books on the subject. So one might say that &quot;the best there is&quot; isn't really as high praise as it deserves.)<br />This book certainly deserves a 5-star rating.	2003-10-10

He is a Washington Times reporter, and shares the paper's conservative viewpoint. But given that (and this should be obvious from the book's title), this is a good summary of the happenings of Election 2000 (from the Bush partisans' point of view).<br />The liberals took the position that people's preferences ought to count, whether they took the trouble to learn the rules of the game or not, and consequently see the final decision of the US Supreme Court as unjust. The conservatives set great store in &quot;playing by the rules,&quot; and they thus condemn the Florida Supreme Court and applaud the US Supreme Court. I personally agree with the conservatives' position here, and so I admit that I am no more impartial in reviewing this book than Sammon was in writing it.<br />Reading this book, it becomes totally clear that the Gore side was willing to try to use the rules when they helped the Gore cause, but to ride roughshod over the rules when the literal meaning of those rules would interfere with their goal. The point that nobody on the Gore side seems to make is that the campaigns were predicated on the rules being what they were (e. g., Bush didn't bother to campaign in Texas; if this were an election by straight national popular vote, he certainly would have done so) so the fact that Gore won more popular votes is really irrelevant. And by any fair investigation of the election of 2000, Bush won on the criteria in place in 2000. So Gore's attempts to reverse the election's outcome really constituted conduct unbecoming a leader. And this book documents these attempts, one by one.<br />Yes, the report ignores any questionable behavior on the other side. But the facts show that there wasn't much, while there was a lot on the Gore side. So the book covers most of what is really important to know about Election 2000.	2003-09-27

And since it seems to be close to my own preference in this regard, I wanted to give the book a high rating. But it misses for two reasons.<br />The mathematics is done using a notation that is sometimes a bit difficult to follow. (And I say this as a holder of a Ph. D. in theoretical chemistry, i. e., one thoroughly familiar with the kind of mathematics that is presented in the book!) And the writing is hard to follow in some places (especially because he'll make lists of points as A, B, C, D and then refer to them by those letters, making the reader go back to find out what he's talking about!)<br />Another reviewer stated that what this book really needs is some editing by someone else. With that judgment I concur. The _material_ in the book is first-rate. The _presentation_ could use some improvement.	2003-09-27

I have to compare this book with another one which I recently bought: &quot;Infinitesimal Calculus&quot; by James M. Henle and Eugene M. Kleinberg. Both books are basically the same in that they use the concept of infinitesimals to provide a more intuitively satisfying basis for the concepts of calculus than the common, &quot;delta/epsilon&quot; limit approach. Yet the two could not be more different in the way they go about it.<br />Henle and Kleinberg's book uses a concept of infinitesimals developed by Abraham Robinson, known as &quot;nonstandard analysis.&quot; In this system, an expanded number system, the &quot;hyperreal number system,&quot; is created, which obeys almost all the same rules as the real number system but includes infinitesimals (numbers different from zero but smaller in absolute value than any other real number), as well as infinite numbers (larger than any real number) and finite but nonstandard numbers. By contrast, the &quot;smooth infinitesimal analysis&quot; used in this book has no infinite numbers, and does not obey the normal laws of logic (in particular, the law of the excluded middle). Bell is well aware of the difference between these two approaches, and gives detailed and valuable comparisons between them in this book.<br />Oddly, nothing could be further than infinitesimals from the ideas of the intuitionist mathematicians like L. E. J. Brouwer, yet Bell's logical system is based on the modifications to logic which Brouwer had to make so that his intuitionistic program could work. And Bell refers to his logical system as intuitionistic.<br />My own personal feeling is that nonstandard analysis has the merits of the logic being familiar and of its being based on the extension of the real number system in a compatible manner, but smooth infinitesimal analysis makes the mathematics easier to _do_ (as, in nonstandard analysis, it is continually necessary to extract the standard part of a nonstandard number, and a corresponding step isunnecessary in smooth infinitesimal analysis). So both have their merit.<br />Another contrast with Henle &amp; Kleinberg's book is that the other book ignores applications, while this book is strongly oriented toward the use of calculus in physical applications.<br />I was tempted to give this book 5 stars, but I find the mathematics in some places rather dense and hard to follow, which was my reason for deducting one star. But I am glad to own both of the two books, this one and Henle &amp; Kleinberg's.	2003-09-26

It is clear that Rucker has read Edwin Abbott's \\"Flatland,\\" and bases his story loosely on it. Even his choice of \\"Joe Cube\\" as the hero's name (a cube is the 3-dimensional analog of a square, and Abbott's hero was literally a square!) is an allusion to Abbott's book. It is really hard to write why I did not like the book without giving away the ending, however. My biggest problem is that, early on in the book, you decide on \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys,\\" but in reading the whole book, you end up having to change your earlier assignment of those roles, in a way I find unnerving.<br />I read this book at about the same time as Ian Stewart's \\"Flatterland.\\" Both are in a sense alike in being fictional sequels to \\"Flatland,\\" though Stewart's book is more closely resemblant to Abbott's original. This book is more of an adventure, while Stewart's is more didactic in terms of conveying a good impression of the spaces it treats; it also covers more varieties of spaces than this book.

Therefore Amy minimizes the disadvantages of PR and emphasizes its advantages. While Farrell has his favorite system (and it is one of Amy's preferred systems, as well as one I like), he only mentions it near the very end; Farrell's book is much more impartial and leaves it to the reader to evaluate the various electoral systems, an approach that I prefer.<br />I very much recommend this book.	2003-08-23

Newton's concept of calculus was based on continuity, while Leibniz used a conceptual framework based on infinitesimals: numbers smaller than any real number, but less than zero. In the 19th century, a rigorous basis was established for Newton's conceptual framework, but it became an article of faith that infinitesimals could not be rigorously used as a basis for calculus. However, in the 20th century, a rigorous basis was established for an infinitesimal-based treatment of the calculus, as a result of Abraham Robinson's \\"nonstandard analysis.\\" This involves expanding the real number system to a much larger number system, the \\"hyperreal number system.\\"<br />In the physical sciences, it is common to use an intuitive treatment of calculus that includes infinitesimals; however, nearly all books on basic calculus avoid them and ignore Robinson's ideas. I only know of two exceptions: a book by H. J. Keisler (who edited Robinson's papers) and this one. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.<br />Keisler's book is unfortunately out of print and nearly unobtainable. It is a complete textbook of calculus, using the approach through nonstandard analysis. Its treatment of the hyperreal number system, however, I find hard to understand. By contrast, this book has a very much clearer treatment of the hyperreals; I think I finally understand how they are constructed after reading this book. But this book is _not_ a complete textbook of calculus. It covers the theory, and covers it extremely well, but does not even attempt to teach how to _use_ calculus. Therefore, it would not be appropriate as a sole textbook in a calculus class, for example.<br />I have read other work by Henle, and it is clear that his forte is explaining unusual number systems. He does a great job in this book at what he does. I just wish he had added more material on how to actually _use_ calculus. Unfortunately, the reader will have to augment this book by another, and since no other in-print book that I know of uses this nonstandard-analysis-based approach, there will be a disconnect if anyone tries to combine it with another book.	2003-08-22

Books	4	36	39	N	Y	A good summary	In 1960, James Cooke Brown developed an idea for a language based on predicate logic, which he called &quot;Loglan.&quot; in 1986 Brown's followers split into two groups, mainly based on Brown's desire to retain a tight proprietary control. The other group (naming itself the Logical Language Group) had to reformulate the vocabulary, and as a result, &quot;Lojban&quot; was created. This book is a description of the resulting language. (Of course, none of this history is given; in particular, the bitterness of the Loglan/Lojban split is not even hinted at!)<br />The main difficulty that the reader may have with this book is one that is not specific to these authors or this book, but endemic to all LLG's writing on Lojban. At some point it was decided that normal words like &quot;noun,&quot; &quot;verb,&quot; and such, as well as the expressions like &quot;simple predicate&quot; that J. C. Brown used in his Loglan article, were inappropriate to the description of Lojban, and only Lojban words like &quot;lujvo,&quot; &quot;gismu,&quot; etc. are to be used. They _are_ defined in this book, but their constant use can be a barrier to easy use of the book.<br />You will not learn to speak or write Lojban from this book (it is sparing in vocabulary) but if you want an idea about how Lojban works, this book is an excellent introduction as long as you can take the constant use of Lojban words for grammatical terms.<br />One caveat, however. The book claims that &quot;Lojban is not a word-order language; it is a particle language.&quot; Nothing could be further from the truth. This reviewer helped to create Voksigid, which is truly a particle language as opposed to a word-order language, and one reason was as a reaction to Lojban.	2003-08-20
