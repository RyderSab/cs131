While Stoll's writing is still engaging, and his contrarian views interesting, so many things he discusses are (in his own words about the Internet) \\"stale, incomplete, misleading...or simply wrong.\\"  The most prominent example is his assertion that \\" The Internet is a poor place for commerce.\\"  There are other assertions in the book that are equally dated.  (Stoll, it might be noted, after calling the possibility of e-commerce \\"baloney,\\" now sells Klein bottles on the Web.  So much for his predictive abilities.)<br /><br />While it is certainly no crime to have gotten predictions about the growth and use of the Web wrong--after all, almost everyone did--this book, with its almost-Luddite overtones regarding the internet, is really not worth the time except as a nostalgia item.	2005-07-24

The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the \\"best of the SF genre.\\" They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.<br /><br />And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is \\"Rocketship Galileo\\" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary \\"Nazis on the Moon!\\" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.<br /><br />Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.<br /><br />There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce \\"Joan\\" as \\"Joanne\\" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced \\"Joanne\\", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.

But seriously.<br /><br />Douglas Adams' books will always have a warm place in my heart.  The combination of science fiction (sorta) and irreverent, Pythonesque humor, was a revelation to me when I first picked up this book, and it continues to be a source of enjoyment and pleasure as the years go by.<br /><br />If you don't know the basics of this book by now, I'm surprised.  But to recap:  first, the Earth is destroyed.  Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />And I'm not kidding.<br /><br />This series of books, as they careen through the galaxy, into the past and the far-future, introduce you to paranoid, depressed robots, wacked-out sentient elevators, torture devices hooked up to fairy-cake, and entire planets destroyed because they have exceeded the \\"shoe event horizon,\\" always entertained me; no small feat.  The characters are interesting, can be related to and, despite the comedic tone, stick with you like the best characters do.  The adventures are ridiculous and riotous, but good clean fun.<br /><br />If you want spaceships that are dank and furnished with old mattresses, or space captains that have baths on the bridge, or aliens that have all the sex appeal of a road accident, this is the book for you.  If not, give it a miss, and you're poorer thereby, but it's your life.  And above all, of course, don't panic.	2005-04-11

I think \\"Cryptonomicon\\" is one of the best books of the last half of the 20th century, and a perfect capstone for the century itself.  I will always give anything by Stephenson a try.<br /><br />But I didn't like this book.  Frankly, I didn't like the series all that much.  We have, what, 2700 pages, and where is the narrative drive?  The creation of a stable currency?  The creation of calculus?  The adventures of Jack Shaftoe?  The background of Enoch Root?  Just what the devil is going on here?<br /><br />I can hear Stephenson in my head now, insisting that such a vast canvas, such a lot of complex material, requires a lot of verbiage.  Could be.  But personally, I like my historical background in my stories to be just that:  background.  I mean, I like \\"Shogun,\\" but if it had stretched into two more books and contained even *more* details about the Portugese, the British explorations of the seas, the Japanese feudal system, the codes of the Samurai, and so on, well, my circuit breakers would have tripped out from overload.  As they did with this series of books.<br /><br />Others have noted, and I concur, that one of the main characters of this book, Daniel Waterhouse, is dull.  Indeed, he is *supremely* dull.  I can forgive a lot, but when I don't give a rip about the main character, why bother to read?<br /><br />Stephenson made much of the fact that he used a pen and ink to write this.  Neal, please:  go back to the computer.  Perhaps if this had all been online, the major narrative skein could have been teased out, and the 2700 pages could have been sweated down to 800 or so.  But man, you write it in ink, I bet you want to keep it.<br /><br />It is basically Stephenson's gift with language that gets this book 2.5 stars, honestly; the story itself is not compelling.  I don't care if he chooses historical fiction, science fiction, fantasy, or whatever, for his next novel, I will give it a chance.  But I hope he regains his earlier form, and exhibits a little more brevity; I am not willing to slog through another 2700 pages--or even 900--again with so little reward at the end.ce.

A book that is both loved and reviled by man.  A book with a lot of ideas, interesting characters, and situations.  A book on which literally years of attention and work were lavished; one in which even the character names are significant.<br /><br />But yeah, is it any good?<br /><br />I like this book.  I've enjoyed it many times since I first read it, oh, 20 years ago or so.  But in my opinion, it's not a \\"great\\" book.  It's interesting, even fascinating, but I find the plot and action a little bumpy (i.e., it doesn't \\"flow\\" [or \\"scan\\" as us writing geeks say]), and a good chunk of the book--towards the end--I honestly find dull.  But the quality and influence are undeniable, and so I have given it four stars.<br /><br />I don't need to really provide a synopsis; you can read those up top.  A few details:  this book contains one of Heinlein's classic characters:  the wise and cantankerous older person (Jubal Harshaw).  Jubal is a whale of fun to me, though, and makes the book more enjoyable.  Also memorable (to me) are Gillian Boardman (Mike's nurse and companion), and Ben Caxton (a reporter).<br /><br />Personally, I loved both the first third of the book--where Mike first comes to Earth--and the middle third--which Mike spends learning something of Earth at Jubal's house--to be the best parts of the novel.  The final portion, where Mike goes out into the world, I find a bit overwrought and forced; it felt to me more that Heinlein was trying to outrage and upset his audience more than entertain it, and I find that somewhat irritating.<br /><br />It should be noted also that, in this post-60s age (remember that the novel was writting during the 50s), the actions in that section of the book have, at least in my case, lost their ability to shock and surprise, and I found them dull and, frankly, pedantic.

I looked forward to many hours totally wasted looking up the rankings of various artists that I enjoyed, or (sometimes even better) hated.  (Nothing like a little shaudenfreude when reading a scathing review of, say, R.E.O. Speedwagon, the hacks.)<br /><br />Like many other reviewers, I have been stunned--literally stunned--by some of the omissions, particularly in the light of who they decided to include.  I mean, Marky-Mark?  They even mention Wahlberg's acting career, for crying out loud!  The Lox?<br /><br />Why, one wonders, is Motorhead included, but not Metallica?  You have Steely Dan, and Walter Becker gets his albums included, but not Donald Fagen?  Where's the logic there?  Brian Eno's albums are listed, but not the equally-influential Robert Fripp?  What happened to Michelle Shocked?  ? and the Mysterians?  Andy Summers?  But of course, as other mentioned, those only scratch the surface of the head-shakers.  How in God's name can you have The Traveling Wilburys, but not George Harrison?  Mick Jagger's pretty lame discography is there, but not Pete Townshend.  No Pete Townshend.  I could scarcely believe it.  I could understand leaving off Robert Fripp--a nerdly musician if ever there was one--but the author of \\"My Generation?\\"  What the hell were they thinking?<br /><br />Folks, this is a decent book, but if you buy it, be completely unsurprised when your favorite, slightly obscure artist (No Adrian Belew!  No Little Charlie and the Nightcats!  No Mojo Nixon!) is unmentioned.  And if you own and enjoy the previous editions, my advice is:  save your money.	2004-12-02

Bush has become an extremely polarizing figure on the American political scene.  Bush seems to be for the Left what Clinton is for the Right; a man--and a President--who can make people froth at the mouth simply at the mention of his name.  A number of people that I know from the California Bay Area literally cannot listen to him or watch him speak.<br />As history moves on, and some distance is put between the past Clinton administration and the current Bush administration, it will be fascinating to see how historians view these two politicians.  Dissimilar as they are, they both share an ability to connect with people *as people* that most other modern politicians lack (Al Gore and John Kerry both suffer from this difficulty).<br />This book, unfortunately, does not paint a very balanced portrait of either Bush or his administration.  Given access to one of the most secretive White Houses in history, Sammon had an excellent chance to bring us some insight into how Bush and his team work during this very difficult time in U.S. history.  What we are given, alas, is what we could probably expect from a reporter from the Right-wing Washington Times, a man lauded by Rush Limbaugh.<br />This book contains the oft-repeated (and wholly-inaccurate) charges that the press is hostile to Bush (when in fact his administration is given a pass on behavior to a greater degree than any other in history); it serves as another forum from which to bad-mouth candidate Kerry (casting aspertions on his Vietnam service); it glosses over the gaps in Bush's own service; and so on.  In short, the lack of balance and perspective make this book appear more as if it was vetted by the RNC than written by an independent investigative journalist.<br />I look forward to reading unwinking analyses of the most recent two presidential administrations, ones that look at both the positive and negative aspects of two men who had enormous impact on our country.  Unfortunately, this book will not help us make such an evaluation.t help us make such an evaluation.	2004-05-11

It's characters are sharply drawn and believable, and the portrait of life in the town that they inhabit realistic and strong.  It's amazing to consider that the author was only 23 when this book was first published.  It's an amazing achievement.<br />And I detested it.<br />It's stupifyingly depressing.  The characters, almost without exception, lead sad, desparate lives with little chance for happiness.  It takes place in a time and a location that not only am I not familiar with, I can't identify with in the least.  Perhaps it helps if one is from the South, or is from a rural environment, or grew up in the earlier part of the last century, or is (maybe) a woman.  I don't know; I'm a late-20th Century urban Yankee, and I couldn't related to it at all.<br />Many people complain that not all movies nor novels should have happy endings.  Life isn't that way, they say; why should fiction?  Perhaps I am a philistine, but I feel that that is *exactly* why I want my fiction to end (more or less) happily.  Life *is* difficult and a struggle, and I do not need to bring more depression, lonliness, sadness, and struggle into it by seeking it out in fiction.  Read the editorial reviews above:  the book is about &quot;the damned, the voiceless, the  rejected.&quot;  It &quot;takes us on shattering  voyages into the depths of the spiritual isolation  that underlies the human condition.&quot;<br />That may be your cup of tea, but it is most certainly not mine.  I found this book astonishingly depressing.  I will never read it again.  Which in no way detracts from my very real appreciation of its literary qualities and the superb writing.<br />How can one balance out those two conflicting feelings?  I gave it three stars, because that's the best I can do.  Judge for yourself if you want to go on the &quot;shattering voyage,&quot; and make your purchasing choice accordingly.	2004-05-02

However, it is clear that Mr. Reagan did have a belief structure to his life, which makes the examination thereof a not-unreasonable task.<br />However, I found this book to be overly-facile and simplistic.  Further, I do not detect the depth of research that, in my view, one should bring to as important a subject as an ex-President of Reagan's stature.  Like him or not, one must admit that Reagan presided over the executive branch during some momentous events and that, further, he had not-negligible skills as a President.  But after reading this book, I must admit that I still don't understand either Reagan the man or Reagan the president any better, nor do I feel that I have many insights, if any, into how his faith played into his policy decisions.<br />I am afraid that, unlike the other reviewers, I cannot recommend this book.  There is an excellent book waiting to be written on this topic, but this isn't it.<br />I must admit that, in light of the current effort to canonize Reagan, I am completely unsurprised that my review has received so many &quot;unhelpful&quot; votes.  I guess anything less than 5 stars is going to get that.	2004-04-02

Fantasy, horror, science fiction, mystery; he refuses to let himself be stuck into a particular category.  As an abstract thing, I admire that very much.  However, for a lover of SF, it's sometimes frustrating.  I loved Simmons' &quot;Hyperion;&quot; it was without question one of the best, most moving science fictions novels I have ever read.  And yet I like this one better.<br />Please note that I don't necessarily think this is a &quot;better&quot; novel than &quot;Hyperion&quot; by some objective standard of &quot;better;&quot; I just enjoyed it more.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is unquestionably a better film than &quot;The Matrix&quot; (despite &quot;The Matrix'&quot; good qualities); I enjoy &quot;The Matrix&quot; more.<br />Enought preamble.  This is a wonderful read.  It moves fast, it has interesting characters, and the various story lines and allusions are blended in to the main action of the novel with wit, fun, and style.  And the book has dimension; if you are familiar with Greek history, or with Homer's &quot;Iliad,&quot; you will get even more from this book.  There's history, science fiction, sociology; it's a blast.<br />And what was most interesting for me:  (very minor spoiler ahead) my favorite characters were not even people.  I just loved the picture of the future history of the artificial lifeforms occupying the asteroids and outer portions of our solar system.  They are drawn with care, sympathy, and great good humor.<br />If you like Simmons, and if you like science fiction, I think you'll love this book.  Interesting characters (with the unfortunate but typical usual collection of science fiction cardboard characters--you can't have everything), a quick-moving, interesting plot, interesting settings...I really couldn't ask for more.  I was looking forward to this book from Simmons, and I was not dissapointed.  Buy, read, and enjoy.	2003-11-04

However, that would be incomplete; I have only read one other of Robinson's books--The Years of Rice and Salt--and based on that book, I have not tried any of his others, even his highly-regarded Mars trilogy.  If you loved &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt,&quot; you should probably read a different review, because we don't share similar sensibilities; I didn't like that book at all.<br />That being said, this is an enjoyable but very uneven book.  The view of Antartic life is wonderful, both the Polar culture and that of McMurdo.  The scene of those two places is well drawn, interesting, and involving.  I really came to enjoy several of the characters, even though most of them are--let's be honest--pretty sparsely drawn or even two-dimensional.  But still, Wade, X, and especially Spiff and Viktor were enjoyable folks to read about.  Their adventures, little and big, made fun reading, and of course the setting is simply awesome.  I think Robinson does an especially good job bringing home to you the vastness, cold, and emptiness of Antarctica (I had a friend who went there for several seasons doing graduate research).<br />Unfortunately, I have two big problems with this book:  the action is very uneven, and one of main characters--Val--I found stupendously annoying.  One at a time.<br />First, the action.  I honestly believe that *everyone* will find this book uneven, and will love some of it, and hate other parts.  The dicey bit is, we're all going to love and hate different things.  For example, a large portion of the book is taken up with an adventure trek (much like today's adventure climbs up Everest) along the same path that Amundsen, the first man to make it to the South Pole, took.  I found almost all of this stupendously dull.  Frankly, I couldn't care less.  There is an especially long section where Val, the guide for the trekkers, is leading them on a long march across the Antarctic plateau, and it goes on for nearly 25 pages.  Walking.  A little dialogue, a lot of internal monologue (the guide's) and a whole lot of walking.  25 pages.  Forgive me, but for me, that's stupifying.  Indeed, on re-reading, I skip the whole thing.<br />But perhaps for you, it would be the best part of the novel, and the things that I love--such as the sub-culture of the folks who are at the Pole--would bore you to tears.  It's hard to say.  But I'm fairly confident that *some* of it will be interesting, and some of it dull.  You've been duly warned.<br />With regard to Val, I will say little.  She is a main character, and it's always a tough ride when you dislike a main character.  Let me just say this:  she keeps saying (and thinking and showing by her behavior) that she is &quot;toast,&quot; i.e. done being a guide in Antarctica.  Well, I got it the first time; I really didn't need to be told another half dozen or more times.  I also found her approach to relationships pretty irritating, her view of men simplistic and absurd, and her physical attributes (how many women does one meet who are 6'4&quot;?  I've met exactly, um, none) to be almost unbelievable.  But who knows; you might like her.  In fact, there are probably plenty of folks who do.<br />So there you have it.

I did not come to \\"Quicksilver\\" expecting Snow Crash II.  Or The Next Diamond Age.  Or really anything directly related to any of Stephenson's other novels.  If Stephenson has shown anything, it's that he really doesn't repeat himself.<br />And that's great; I was ready for that.  Indeed, I prefer it over all these other Science Fiction authors--Robert Jordan is a prime example of this--who set out to write trilogies, or who write a series of novels for no other reason (or so it seems to me) except to capitalize on the success of the first book in the series.  I know that many folks really enjoy those series, and I have no problems with that; I just find it tiresome.<br />But the deal is, I found this book immensely disappointing.  This is not, as others have noted, a novel; it's a history book.  It's a very good history book, with sparkling detail, Stephenson's wonderful language, interesting settings, and all the rest that we've come to expect from this gifted author.  What it doesn't have, so far as I can tell, is a plot.  There was no narrative drive, no forward motion.  Perhaps, as one reviewer has noted, all that will kick in with the next two books in the series.  But even so, I like my books to stand on their own (there's plenty of drive in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" for example), and this one really doesn't.  (I also miss Stephenson's trademarked hilarious \\"riffs,\\" such as the amazing \\"Deliverator\\" opening sequence in \\"Snow Crash,\\" or the bizarre-yet-endearing-and-also-hysterical dissertation on the correct way to eat Cap'n Crunch in \\"Cryptonomicon;\\" they are almost entirely absent here or, much sadder, present but leaked of their absurdist color.)<br />I have said before that I would be perfectly willing to admit it if Stephenson put out a stinker.  Well, this isn't a stinker, but this is certainly no great work of literature.  Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I like my novels to have plot.<br />Still, this is a book that is better than so many other books out there, and Stephenson is such a superior writer, that I will no doubt buy his next book as well, hoping it will be better.  But for you Stephenson neophytes, I would recommend his other works, especially \\"Snow Crash\\" and \\"Cryptonomicon.\\">Still, this is a book that is better than so many other books out there, and Stephenson is such a superior writer, that I will no doubt buy his next book as well, hoping it will be better.

US	53017068	REEEZUT7WUMW0	0440178002	191357398	Shogun (Asian Saga)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Highly Enjoyable Quasi-Historical Epic	This book is--as my dear old Grandma would have said--a ripper.  In case you are one of the 9 people who haven't heard of it, it is a consistently-entertaining adventure/political intrigue story set in medieval Japan at the dawn of the Shogun era, just prior to the expulsion of Europeans from the Japanese home islands.  It is based on the true story of William Adams who, as near as I can find out (there appears to be precious little in English on the man) really did sail to &quot;The Japans&quot; in the early 17th century, and did indeed become a samurai.  But as others point out, it ain't history, and it isn't a language lesson, either.  It also purportedly contains anachronistic touches, such as the highly-stylized samurai code (which apparently wasn't codified until quite a bit later), and so on.<br />That aside, it's a pile of fun.  This isn't &quot;great literature&quot; by any stretch, but it's interesting and engrossing.  It's a bit too long, weighing in at something close to 900 pages, but if you are fascinated by the Japanese medieval culture, or by the political intrigue of the Elizabethan era, you'll enjoy this.  If digression from accepted history bothers you, or a somewhat-windy style of writing irritates you, give it a miss.  But speaking personally, this is the only Clavell novel that I've really been able to get into, and I've even re-read it a number of times.	2003-09-19
US	53017068	R1VH4DIDIYFCE9	0785787283	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	3	14	18	N	N	Famous Novel is a Very Mixed Bag	Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the \\"best of the SF genre.\\" They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.<br />Still reading?<br />This novel is almost the quintessential definition of \\"mixed bag.\\"  Heck, not only is it a mixed bag, but if you don't like Heinlein/think he is a fascist/think he is a libertarian/think he glorifies war/think he wishes he were Hemmingway/think he is unbelievably egalitarian, by God this book will give you plenty of ammunition (sorry) for your point of view.  Which is, I'm sure, part of its enduring appeal.<br />This book is really two books rolled into one (and in less than 200 pages!).  The first book is, as the author himself admits, a celebration of military service, a glorification of the common G.I. (although in the book he's more of a space Marine than an Army regular).  As such, it's a slam-bang adventure story told in a first-person, very spare style.  It follows the by-now classic arc of aimless civilian, harsh boot-camp (think Louis Gossett in \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\"), and difficult-but-rewarding service in a tough war.  It's a hell of a yarn.<br />The other book is really the problematic part; an argument in favor of (indeed, pretty much a polemic for) the franchise being earned rather than granted gratis to everyone.  In the case of the book, this is earned through \\"federal service,\\" and there are lengthy discussions and debates as to why this is a good system.  And in the end, it is this assumption--that a better government would arise out of requiring federal service prior to being given the vote--that causes all the outrage (or plaudits) from readers of this book.<br />But the question is, does it make for a good book?  And the answer is, not always.  The blend of political jerimiad and coming-of-age war story is often jarring, and occasionally irritating.  The blatant speechifying by \\"older and wiser,\\" whether you agree with it or not, frequently comes across as thinly-viewed authorial lecturing.  And is that what you want in your books?  It's up to you, honestly.<br />That said, *I* like this book, and I have re-read it a number of times, but I am certainly not blind to its faults.  Not Heinlein's best, but perhaps one of his more influential books, and certainly one of the two (the other being, of course, \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\") that generates the most discussion.  The choice is yours.er government would arise out of requiring federal service prior to being given the vote--that causes all the outrage (or plaudits) from readers of this book.<br />But the question is, does it make for a good book?

I was disappointed in both respects.  As a fantasy novel, this is perfectly servicable; the writing is spare and fine and (admirably for a fantasy novel, as all too often they drown under the author's delusions of what constitutes \\"fantasy writing,\\" in my opinion) pretty much crystal clear.  I found the characters to be a bit wooden, but that is hardly death in a book.  I've read plenty of books with flat characters that I've enjoyed greatly.<br />But the world; ah, the world.  The world's the thing in fantasy books, isn't it?  And I couldn't accept this world, this world of almost-but-not-quite medieval Japan.  It was frustrating.  I didn't know what I could hold on to.  *Is* it medieval Japan, or not?  What pieces of the culture were made up (for the author's convenience, or because that was the world the author created, I had no idea), and what were drawn straight from history?  I felt almost as if I were going cross-eyed trying to decide.  And after a while, honestly, I just gave up.  I wanted medieval Japan, not almost.  And while, yes, many fantasy novels draw on almost-medieval England, they somehow don't frustrate me nearly as much as this novel.<br />Perhaps if you are more forgiving of this almost-but-not-quite thing, you will enjoy this novel.  For me, it was just frustrating, and I didn't.  Make up your own mind about that before you plunk down your 10 bones, and you'll probably be okay.	2003-09-13

If you look at my history, you'll see that.  I feel that far too many Amazon.com reviewers give out 5 star reviews all the time, and once a book is awash in laudatory reviews, it's almost impossible to tell if it's really good, or simply draws a lot of fans to tappity-tap in gushing reviews.  If you see what I mean.<br />2) I love Neal Stephenson.  I would read pretty much anything by him.  I acknowledge that he's put out some stinkers (\\"The Big U,\\" anyone?), but I love his stuff.  If he put out another stinker, I wouldn't be blind to it's stinkiness, but this ain't a stinker.<br />If you're still reading, here's the deal:  this is a wonderful book.  I don't know that I'd stack it on the top of a pile of \\"Great 20th Century Literature,\\" but I'd sure as hell read it again rather than plow through, say, Faulkner.  Some have compared this to \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" and while I understand the comparison--Pynchon and Stephenson both have a tendency to \\"riff;\\" sort of the authorial equivalent of Robin Williams going off on a comedy tangent--Stephenson's prose is for me far more accessible.  Perhaps it's an age thing; Stephenson and I are of an age (born rather than coming of age in the 60s).  As some say, perhaps you have to be of that age and a nerd.  I dunno.  But I love his stuff.<br />There's almost too much in this book to discuss, but in short, there are two intertwined stories:  one set in WWII, and involving a literal ship-load of gold; and one set in the 1999 present, and involving a virtual ship-load of gold.  The inter-relationship of the characters is nicely done, if perhaps a bit forced.  The inter-twining of the stories is pretty jarring at first, but one becomes accustomed to it.  And the settings (corporate geekdome during the heyday of the internet boom; various WWII locales) are for me fascinating.  But then I'm a geek who lived through the internet boom, and I'm rivited by WWII.  If you aren't, you should probably give it a pass.<br />Finally, to me the language is a delight.  Does it slow the story down considerably to read a 3 page dissertation on eating Cap'n Crunch?  Or an encounter between a Marine and a bunch of Japanese soldiers in a sushi bar just prior to Pearl Harbor?  Or a comparison on the relative skill and courage required to either pull seriously impacted wisdom teeth vs. take a major relationship risk?  Or read about the formulae required to fairly divide up Granny's valuable antique furniture so as to take into account both its monetary and emotional value?  Hell yes.  But it's damn wonderful all the same.  Not to mention hilarious.<br />If any of this sounds funny, or interesting, or potentially entertaining to you, give it a go; you won't be dissapointed.  If it doesn't, heck, give it a miss; there's plenty of good books out there.  Few as good as this one *for me*, but you're not me, so judge for yourself.vited by WWII.

Pynchon also has both detractors and admirers, and which category you fit into will certainly influence your enjoyment of this book.<br />Pynchon is in love with language, and has considerable gifts as a writing stylist.  His prose is thick with description, one might even say artistic digression.  If that pumps your 'nads, this will probably be a great book for you.  Personally, I find his style to be overwrought and self-congratulatory; as if he is saying, &quot;Look at the cool things I can toss off--ain't I talented?&quot;  Plenty of other people disagree, of course, and find it hilarious, fascinating, brilliant, or what have you.  I didn't.  I found it stupifying.<br />Further, Pynchon's penchant (sorry) for picking up and dropping plot lines is for me vastly irritating.  One friend once pointed out that life is like that; plot threads in life don't always intertwine neatly by the end.  And sure, that's true, but why the heck put a lot of effort into reading fiction when it turns out frustrating and irritating like life?  I have plenty of frustration and irritation already; I don't need to plunk down 10 smackers and spend a lot of time getting more.<br />Other reviewers have commented on the post-60s boomer navel gazing that is also prevalent in the novel, and I certainly agree with that assessment.  Obviously I'm not the right person to recommend this book if you're a Pynchon fan, but if you're on the fence, I would skip this one and read &quot;The Crying of Lot 49,&quot; a collection of his short stories, or bite the bullet and give &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; a try.	2003-09-07

Some may find the episodic nature irritating--England, Canada, Japan, the Northern Passage, Siberia--but I personally loved it.  I know nothing of Siberia, and while I suspect that the descriptions of it here are, ahem, somewhat romaticized, they certainly *are* fascinating, at least for me.  The descriptions of the other locations, especially those of shipboard life on a tramp steamer, are also well-done and interesting.  And of course Johnny Porter, for all his supposed emotionlessness, is a great character, full of suppressed rage (at least to me).<br />Davidson is a wonderful writer, the story moves along well, and the final chase scene across Siberia is, for me, almost worth the book by itself.  The small touches of irony that Davidson adds (a Jewish writer lovingly mentioning the highly non-kosher meals that Porter eats, for example, or the obvious point made by the damage done to Porter at the end and how it relates to what he was trying to get out of Siberia) make the book enjoyable on second reading as well.  I think thriller lovers will really enjoy this book.  It is nothing at all like LeCarre; it's more like what Crichton would write if he was a much better artist with the language.	2003-09-07

Telushkin--clearly a writing machine--has penned a highly enjoyable overview of Jewish humor, complete with plenty of jokes.  He has broken down the humor by category, but truly, this is just a fun romp through a type of humor that has so permeated American culture that many of the jokes have been translated into other formats (with rabbis changing into Priests or Pastors, for example).<br />This ain't anything to knock your socks off, but it's an enjoyable read.	2003-09-07

One of the typical knocks against Heinlein is that his books usually star the &quot;Heinlein Hero,&quot; a brilliant, tough, sensible Renaissance man; hard if not impossible to kill, ever rising to the occassion.  Manny, our hero in this book, is not one of those men.  He is hardly brilliant, doesn't want to get involved, and is pitched into the main action of this story--an updating of the American Revolution, but set on/in the Moon (or &quot;Luna&quot;)--almost by accident.  Manny is, to be honest, one of my very favorite Heinlein characters.  (One of the others being Henry Gladstone Kiku of &quot;The Star Beast,&quot; but I digress.)  Manny has a distinctive voice, and is one of the few characters of fiction who, for me, stays with me after the story.<br />The story itself is enjoyable, if a bit bumpily paced.  To me it had a bit too much start and stop action, but I am completely willing to forgive that given how much I enjoy the characters, the setting, and the fascinating (to me) circumstances conjured by Heinlein in setting up his society in Luna.  Not only has Manny stayed with me, but the Lunar society I find one of his most solid &quot;worlds;&quot; so much so that I was greatly pleased when he revisited it in a later book (&quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;).<br />If you have enjoyed Heinlein but not read this book, I believe you will really like it.

I will not dispute any of this; this is an excellently-written book that does a wonderful job exploring the mother/daughter relationship.  (Not being either one, I'm somewhat handicapped at commenting on how accurate it is in that area.)<br />I do think, however, that one should be aware of Gornick's take on what constitutes a memoir.  Gornick has written that she views the lives on which a memoir is based to be the \\"rough draft.\\"  She feels that the \\"memoir\\" does not need to be held to the strict standards of truefulness that other non-fiction is.  (For details on Gronick's take on what a memoir is, please read her piece in Salon:  [...]<br />Personally, I find her explanations unsatisfactory, and her justifications to be rationalizations at best.  I do not get enjoyment from the literary technique of an unreliable narrator, no matter how many literary persons find it to be a brilliant technique for exploring whatever (the universality of subjectivity, the unreliability of supposed objectivity, the capricious nature of life, or what have you), and similarly I have trouble with the concept of a \\"memoir\\" that is, at it's base, a piece of fiction.  Perhaps I am a philistine, but I much prefer something like \\"The Ladies Auxiliarly,\\" which, while certainly *based* on the author's life, does not pretend in any way to *be* life.<br />That caveat aside, I *do* honestly think that this is a very good book that many will enjoy.

He noted that some folks promote their religions by giving out pamphlets from fold-up tables.  He noted, \\"If someone asked a Jew about Judaism, he'd have to do this,\\" and he plunked down a stack of about 10 books on his desk with a loud whack.<br />That's how it gets after 3500 years, I'm afraid.<br />Well, here it is for your perusal; Judaism between two covers.  It's not complete, but it's pretty much the best damn overview of Judaism that I have ever seen.  It's well-written, concise, informative, and thorough.  There is very little authorial agenda in the book, and he clearly tries to treat potentially hot \\"political\\" issues (such as the divisive \\"Who is a Jew\\" issue) as even-handedly as possible (Telushkin is an Orthodox Rabbi).  Further, the book is laid out in such a way, like encyclopedia entries, that a person looking for information on a particular topic--such as the Jewish take on Jesus, say--can find it quickly and easily.<br />If you are interested in learning about Judaism at all, or if you are a Jew yourself who wants a good starting point for educating yourself, I highly recommend this book.	2003-08-13

And sadly, I have been profoundly disappointed by both.<br /><br />I have no idea what Trevanian's purpose was in writing this novel. Was he trying a deconstruction of the Western genre, a la Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven?\\" Was he trying to make some strange point regarding the Western in general? What purpose did he possibly think he was serving by presenting us with all these unpleasant characters in a profoundly unpleasant situation? And then (sorry for the spoiler, folks) putting on a depressing ending to boot? I am utterly baffled.<br /><br />I must add that I am further suspicious of Trevanian's motives; part of the way through this (very short) book, I began to suspect that he was sneering down his nose at all us American Western-lovers (I, by the way, am not a very big fan of Westerns [e.g., my favorite film \\"Western\\" is either \\"Little Big Man,\\" or \\"The Shootist,\\" neither of which can really be considered conventional westerns]--and I got a very strong impression that he was condescending to us to write a \\"literary\\" Western novel. Whatever the hell that is.)<br /><br />In any even, I cannot recommend this book. The characters are unpleasant. The plot is unpleasant. The outcome is unpleasant. And the miasma of authorial sneering (for me) hung over the entire novel. I would give this one a firm miss.	2003-04-02

But honestly, I can't understand all the rave reviews for this book.  The main characters are, to me, completely uninvolving and uninteresting cyphers.  There is no plot that I was able to detect.  And worst of all, the overall feeling of constant whimsey I found to be oppressive and cloying.  If one wants whimsey in reasonable doses, I would recommend &quot;Neverwhere&quot; by Neil Gaiman, a book that, in my opinion, has some of the same elements that many reviewers seem to enjoy, without the overwhelming cloyingness that made this book a chore for me.<br />Obviously, the mileage of others varies considerably, but I found this to be a long, uninvolving book whose atmosphere is opressive.	2002-06-23

The information on passport stamps, for example, is very handy if you plan on traveling in other countries in the Middle East.<br />However, I have to disagree with avalonwitch and agree with alfassa; the pro-Palestinian (or anti-Israeli; pick your poison) bias in this book is very strong and pervasive.  Right from the beginning, one notices things such as the fact that B.C. and A.D. are used, rather than the Jewish or Muslim equivalents (or the widely-accepted B.C.E. and C.E.)  There's a sidebar swipe at the Mossad, for example, that concentrates on their \\"bungles\\" (of which there are, of course, some) rather than such successes as the detection of the Iraqi nuclear reactor, the successful capture of Nazi war-criminals, and so on.  This attitude is all through the book.<br />That said, there's some good stuff here.  I just wish Lonely Planet's editors could have been more even-handed.  After all, while Israel has certainly done some things that are pretty awful (e.g., Lebannon), the Palestinians aren't exactly free of blame, either (e.g., strapping bombs to themselves and going to discos to blow themselves up).  An even-handed approach would have made this another excellent Lonely Planets guidebook.	2002-06-11

Hitchens' has been appearing on radio programs of late to promote this book, and I caught one such program this morning.  To be frank, even thought I agree with some of what he has to say, his tone was so full of  hatred, anger, and know-it-all superiority that I was completely repelled.  I kept hearing a line from &quot;Broadcast News&quot; over and over in my  head as Hitchens continued to spray his invective and vitriol: &quot;It  must be nice to always know better, to know that you're the smartest person  in the room.&quot;<br />If you are looking for a well-balanced, dispassionate,  factual discussion of the pros and cons of Clinton and Clinton policies,  look elsewhere.
