Only $18.00 for over 600 pages of one of the most widely  read masters of horror in our times. Most people become familiar with Poe  through mandatory reading assignments in middle school. How many of us were  forced to memorize &quot;The Raven&quot;--and now are so glad we did?  <br />This heavy yet sturdy book allows one to spread their ravenal wings so  to speak and enjoy Poe at will. Perhaps with a snifter of warmed brandy  while seated in a leather buttoned wing chair, one can read through  &quot;The Telltale Heart&quot;, &quot;Murders of the Rue Morgue&quot; or  one of our favorites, &quot;A Cask Of Amontilliado&quot;. Listen! Sounds of  the Carnival in Spain, bawdy drunken laughter, the echoing steps down into  the dank wine cellar, the lure of tasting a rare wine, the viciousness  taken upon the despised know-it-all, chaining him to the wall, entombing  him in, brick by brick until the very last one is in place, the realized  screams as the torch is thrown and his death ends his arrogance by a  supposed mere simpleton. <br />One can only imagine Poe's daily thoughts,  dreams, and nightmares. Whether drug induced or not, Edgar Allen Poe's hand  to paper still thrills us today and forever. This compilation would make a  great gift for literary lovers and students who will become enthralled by  this scary genius.<br />other reading suggestions: &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; by  Stephen King <br />Thanks for your interest &amp; comment vote--Goldcoast	2000-09-04

This wild and wacky paperback book is chocked full of the wildest stories  about all sorts of sports we have ever read. We like to use Charles  Reichblum's other book, Knowledge In A Nutshell, for all types of trivia,  this Nutshell is specifcally for we sports nuts!<br />Almost 200 pages of  laugh out loud stories and the true facts behind them. Some are almost  unbeliveable. But, we defer to &quot;Dr. Knowledge&quot;, the author, who  has collected and researched these outlandish sports anecdotes for over 50  years now. We enjoy his straight forward writing style and sense of  whimsy.<br />Read about when Harry Karry actually played baseball at Wrigley!  Or, about the pseudo-football team some bored stock brokers made up in 1941  and called in their every game winning scores to the press. One of our  favs, which Amazon mentions is how Gaylord Perry hit his 1st major league  homerun on the same day the 1st man walked on the moon! And that manager  Alvin Dark had predicted it 7 years earlier by referring to Perry's lack of  power during batting practice by saying, &quot;A man will walk on the moon  before Perry hits a home run in the big leagues.&quot; Do you know how did  the &quot;hatrick&quot; came into play during a Stanley Cup playoff game?  Who hit 3 homeruns into 3 states in the same game? What did Gary Player do  to Tony Lema at Pebblecreek on the 18th green? Hoaxes, jokes, unreal  oddities, this book has it all.<br />A great gift to yourself or anyone into  sports with a sense of humor and wanting to know more than just the stats.  Ya could win yourself some bucks at a Sports Pub!	2000-09-04

There used to be a dozen fresh roses delivered weekly in her  honor from one time husband Joe Dimagio. No more roses, Joe has left us  too, but, Marilyn's simple yet elegant tombstone is still there.<br />And for  those of us that will admit to our quirky yet noble curiosities, this book  enhances the lives of 75 famous people with information and full-color  photographs of their final resting places. Some seem to reflect how they  lived--larger than life, some quiet and unassuming.<br />We found this book to  be completely fascinating. Well designed colorfully detailed cemetary  photos along with little known factoid bios cover such famous people as the  afore-mentioned Marilyn Monroe to Martin Luther King, Jr., Golda Meir to  Jackie Robinson, James Dean to Irving Berlin. There are gunfighters, sports  legends, military heroes, writers , explorers and more.<br />With this unique  hard stock paperback book, one can whistle through the graveyard in the  comfort of their own home. Or plan to visit these legends on an historical  vacation in The States and Europe. One could then whisper, (sorry, we  cannot resist)--I see dead people's graves! Seriously, as the author and  photographer Gregg Felsen stated,  &quot; Most of these people overcame  great obstacles and adversity on their roads to greatness in their  respective fields. This book is meant to honor these remarkable  people.&quot;<br />A great gift for those interested in famous people,  history, photography, travel, and death.	2000-09-04

The curved artistic forms of  Yoko Ono &amp; John Lennon show them as they were--as one. You just want to  slowly trace your finger over their shapes.<br />There are over 200 photos to  delight the senses. Most are of famous people which Ms. L has had contacts  with from her work at Rolling Stone and other venues. These performers seem  to open up to this photographer and are willing to show something more than  their &quot;star&quot; profile.

Bill Quinn, a love interest,  is on his 4th tour of duty as captain of the tunnel rats--finding,  fighting, escaping from 'neath a matrix ravaged earth.<br />This is Ms. Steel  at her best.

Candles flickering, lush voices whispering, and men, some actual boys,  servicing women in passionate gentle ways. From the absolute gorgeous cover  to the lyrical words by authoress Kathy Hepinstall--we become lost in a  world of patient men and recovering women. <br />The central character,  Charlotte, herself had been violently raped by three Servicemen during WWII  in Louisiana. Becoming pregnant, reclusive, she finds a means of  redemption. And so do the men who softly kiss, carress, and fill the  desires of women needing everything but the actual act of intercourse. We  especially liked one section:  &quot;Back at the House of Gentle Men, women  had already begun to choose their courtly mates for the night, and the  house was beginning to rock with gentleness, as room by room, kisses were  asked for and received. ... Despite the fact that electricity had been  restored, the men were lighting candles so as to cast a soft light on the  lonely, not-yet-soothed faces of women who had managed to escape their  families, children, spinsterhood or dead husbands' ghosts.&quot; <br />Simply  yet artistically told is a delving story into Charlotte's life, those  around her and quite possibly, something we all need--comfort.<br />An  interesting well crafted debut.	2000-08-31

Here, day to day life is  not just a jungle, it is a survivor's path of dirt, grafitti, wretched  poverty, petty crime, and the force 's obstacle course of keeping some  modecum of decorum in their lives, as well as in their assigned  neighborhood.<br />Franco is mourning her violently lost lover Maggie. Almost  as a turtle wears it's shell, Franco's tough exterior is a protective  armour of grueling workouts, alcohol sprints, workaholic tendencies, and  self -imposed isolation. Strangely, the tracking of a serial rapist and  murderer brings her back to life. <br />I did enjoy this criminal read. There  were a few too many characters for my tastes. And at times the writing was  trite. Also on the negative side, I wanted to visualize through the  author's words the take down of the rapist. That is like the pay-off in a  crime story. Like pulling on a  one-armed bandit till it spews the action  for you. Well, no whistles and bells here--just played off with a newspaper  story. I'm not sure if Ms. Clare had a reason for that or if she just ran  out of ideas. <br />In fact, I am wondering if someone else wrote the spicy  narratives found before most chapters. Now, those were tightly woven  glimpses into the rapists life as the story progressed. I anticipated them  and found them original, not so forced as some of the book  seemed.<br />&quot;Bleeding Out&quot; is an easy to read criminal novel  needing a few more twists than lesbianism.

The difference  is an emotionally and physically inbalance of toleration. In this easy to  read informative book, Dr. Elkind has put together in Q and A form some of  the more recent solutions for migraine sufferers.<br />Interestingly,  migraines can be genetic. I have a very good friend who has kept track of  her medical history and found that on her maternal side, migraines run  rampant. She has also found that one of her triggers to such pain is  bologna--the food. I have witnessed her using ice packs, darkened rooms,  medications--anything to stop the excrutiating pain which sometimes goes on  for days. I must admit though, I have also noticed her using her migraines  as a way to defer from work or any unwanted activity. Leading me to  believe, as mentioned in the book, migraines can almost be emotionally  contagious. <br />I liked the way this book is arranged and can be used often  by sufferers or those around migraine patients. It is helpful and fairly  complete. There are some newer meds on the pharmacutical market now.

Having two teen sons leads my nose of curiosty to all sorts of helpul books. No one source is a panacea. However, I am happy to know I am not  alone in this wonderous yet sometimes bothersome Generation X. Baggy pants,  booming music, wild hair colors, peculiar body piercings all are cries for  individuality. But is there any sort of ambition under those generational  masks? Yes--boundless ambition, in need of direction.<br />This book by David  Stevenson and Barbra Schneider comes in hardback and paperback. I suggest  the paperback. You are going to want to refer to it time and again. One  theme I have noticed in many books including &quot;The Devoicing Of  America&quot;, is that of isolation. Teens today are wrapped into computers  &amp; video games so much, they have gotten away from a guiding hand. They  are alone and lost.<br />Surprisingly, compared with the 1950's generation,  today's teens have fewer long-lasting relationships and spend much more  time alone. Many stay in college longer in lieu of leaping into marriage.  They need more guidance than ever before. Would we expect a lone traveler  to be told you must reach point A and not give them any map, or ideas or  support? No, everyone needs some direction.<br />The study these adolescence  experts did of over 7,000 teens shows this generation to be the most  ambitious of them all. These teens expect to go to college, graduate and  find high paying jobs. On the other hand, when asked how, few had answers.  They just expect it. And some of the blame rests on we parents and  teachers. Teens take the wrong courses, choose the wrong colleges and then  enter college with unrealistic expectations.<br />Through this book, we can  find helpful ways of directing teens and even pre-teens of today without  adding pressures. I found the following of several students ( Grace,  Elizabeth, and Jake) throughout their high school years and then  re-visiting them in college interesting case studies of comparison of tools  which can be implemented by any care giver.<br />Again, getting back to basics  is a central theme. Of course it does not solve everything. It is a first  step. It is a way of beginning a successful trip through adolesence to  positive adulthood. A way to make dreams come true. Be there for your teen.  Communicate. Listen.<br />Of course, you can lead a horse to water, but you  cannot make him drink--leave the book out, you'll see, the ponies of today  will also quench themselves and find help in becoming strong stallions of  tomorrow.<br />--CDS--which can be implemented by any care giver.<br />Again, getting back to basics  is a central theme.

A place for a person to remember the good things, let the little  things go and strive to move foreward.<br />Lacking was an effective way to  work with these type of people. Just listing an activity, such as making a  photo album, or writing a journal, still does not cover the enormous amount  of patience one must have to direct one of dementia.

He just has a way of drawing me in to his  characters with their transitional dialouge. I want to know them, care  about them, and of course despise horrific villains. And as for action  adventures, well, let's just say he moves a plot around like a Chinese  acrobat with an inner ear problem!<br />In &quot;By The Rivers of  Babylon&quot;, we meet an extensive group of characters who begin a journey  of peace for the Middleast. Two Concordes take off from Lod airport. A  mysterious Lear jet invades their flying space. Not known to the pilots and  passengers is the fact that a rebel Palestinian guerilla, Rish , has had  bombs planted in the tails of each bird as they were being built a year  before. Leading to an exciting kidnapping and forced landing.<br />What I  enjoyed the most in this compelling book were the strategies of war. How  different eras as well as nations handled nightime invasions for example.  And how one must do anything to survive--anything. This seemed to be a  pre-cursor to &quot;The Lions Game&quot; by DeMille. Similar themes,  however, I was intrigued with the setting of Babylon. The history involved,  the colorful descriptions of the Euphrates river, how Mesopatamia had been  a glorious city and it's ironic downfall.<br />Highly recommended reading for  the adventure lover.<br />Your interest &amp; comment votes are  appreciated--CDS	2000-08-22

This is one of the most fearless yet frightening technological ages we are  privledged to live in. We can zap off an e-mail to Grandma with cute lil  pix attached--and not have to hear her inquiring personal curiosities.  We  can leave a message on a business colleagues text pager--without explaining  why we cannot make that 5 pm meeting. Our children can hide behind a  pixeled monitor and act like they are tough teens with their verbage of  garbage--and feel they can do the same amongst society. <br />This amazing  book delves into a subject which is coming to the forefront. Just what are  we losing by being so advanced in communications? Alot. Rich moments of  physical contact, eye contact, a closeness of the human spirit which  propels us to care. Everything is becoming too cold now, impersonal. Don't  get me wrong, I have a fax, computers, pagers, cell phones and use them  all. I also took a hard look at myself and others who enjoy such  &quot;toys&quot;. I like taking the easy way out. And the more e-connected  I am--the more I lose in communal inspiration.<br />Author , John Locke,  explains that talking, simple talking, a la sitting on the bench in front  of the old soda shoppe, pulling back a swig of an icy bottle of root beer,  discussing something as simple as the weather or the school bake sale,  builds and maintains relationships. Without the personal touch, we are  losing sense of self. We are becoming a tunnel visoned society. Not that  these wonderful inventions are not helpful or needed, but at what cost?<br />I  was on a cruise ship a few months ago. Before we left port, I was sitiing  on the aft deck, relaxing, people watching, anticipating making new  acqaintances. As I looked around, I counted at least 20 people on their  cell phones.

Since my brother noticed my review on the last book he sent me, a true  story of submarine espionage during The Cold War, &quot;Blind Mans  Bluff&quot;, I guess he figured to warm up my library with another real  life adventure--&quot;Horses Don't Fly&quot;. As I opened his package, I  admit, I sighed. However, this book is enthralling and compelling as any  fictional novel I have ever read.<br />Frederick Libby wrote his impactful  memoir in 1961. He passed away in 1970. There are so many questions I want  to ask him. His marvelous capacity for recalling specific details on his  life as first a cow puncher out West to his becoming the first American to  down five enemy planes during WWI is fascinating indeed. I truly think of  him as being the first Marlboro Man. Not in a negative tobacco way, as a  rugged, adventurous, spirited man who can capture your attention as fast as  he learned to be a pilot and use a machine gun. Which was one day!<br />Some  of my favorite parts of Libby's experiences are during his stand with the  Canadian army. Through sensitivity, detail, and even humor, he recreated  scenes of comraderie with fellow pilots I shall not soon forget. Friends  lost in combat, poignant depictions of wartime London, even playful  pranks.<br />Libby was a true hero. With medals to prove it. Yet, his writing  reveals he was just a cowboy who learned how to fly. He tangled with the  Red Barron and won, but does not flaunt his ego. In this day of techno wars  and seeking singular positive influences--this man amazes me.<br />A superb  true to life memoir of a flying Ace in WWI.<br />--CDS--	2000-08-18

Man Ray envisoned  etheral impressions through his works. I discovered this beautiful book of  300 duotone photos at a quaint little shoppe by the University. Don't you  just love to happen upon old books unmasking new treasures? Me too. And I  will definately be seeking out more regarding Man Ray's career as a  commercial artist, photographer, and as a colleague of Marcel Duchamp and  the New York Dadaists.<br />These poses, these works of art, through Ray's  impeccably searching eyes, have a quality of hallowedness. An American, he  had moved to Paris in 1921 and quickly became one of the most celebrated  experimentalists of his era. Fascinatingly, he used a simple yet efective  innovation of solaraization, which bestowed a ghostly silver aura upon his  posers. Just truly remarkable!<br />Classic images of Salvador Dali, Breton,  Yves Tanguy, Jean Cocteau, and even Gertrude Stein are among this  embodiment. Also his creative assembled objects and a selection of fashion  spreads for Vanity Fair, Vogue, and Harper's Bazaar.<br />A truly gorgeous  photograpy book to be lost in.<br />Thank you for your interest &amp; comment  votes--CDS	2000-08-18

And I adore The Empire State building in New York City. (as if I need to mention location) This is an  informative book by Mr. Doherty and others giving us a detailed view into  dreams coming to life of the then tallest building in the world. How it was  built, human drama behind the scenes, how fast it went up---4 stories a  week, the limestone that was only brought in from Indiana, and other  fascinating information.<br />With a glossary, index, photo's of helmeted men  in 1930---daringly straddling beams above a floor of cement doom, one can  relive visiting this icon or enjoy true anticipation of using one of its 73  elevators to reach for the heavens on an open aired viewing floor where  everything from weddings to arm wrestling competitions take place.<br />Did  you know they began using outdoor lights due to an aircraft bomber, lost in  the fog and crashing into her 79th floor back in the 40's? And now, one can  see it adorned with special lit colors--Blue was done as a tribute to Frank  Sinatra, Blue &amp; White for Churchill, and Gold for the Pope.<br />Yes, the  building that may now not be the tallest, will forever hold a special place  in our hearts. As seen in many movies, from King Kong to Sleepless In  Seattle, we can step back and wonder who is behind those 6,000 windows (  you might spot Donald Trump, he owns part of her now ) and wistfully sigh  at the romance of it all.<br />other reading suggestions: &quot;The Majesty of  the French Quarter&quot; by Kerri McCaffety<br />--CDS--	2000-08-15

Top ten reviewer's, Mr. Mitchell's, suberb glimpse through his words sold me on this fascinating book. Anticipating  arrival from Amazon was like licking my lips for a taste of cafe au lait  and sugary beignets from Cafe De Monde.  <br />New Orleans or N'Awlnsss as  some say, is one grande damme of a city, one of my favorites. History,  vibrant colors, music, food, the naughty and the mannerly--I can never get  enough. We spent New Years Eve there cruising our favorite haunts and  finding new ones. This book by Kerri McCaffety shows mostly the hidden New  Orleans. Unique furnishings, paintings, gardens and secretive views from  galleries or balconies. One can almost feel Jean Lafitte, the pirate, stare  through you as you dare to cross Pirates Row behind the most photograhed  church in the country, St. Louis Cathederal in Jackson Square.<br />One of my  very favorite photos is one of the first, a frosty icicle adorned tropical  courtyard--a true testament to contrasting Crescent City. Another is the  dreamscaped dome in a three story townhouse. Harrah's in NO, has almost  captured that feeling in their Jazz Bar.<br />The only thing I wish, is that  there were more photos of , well, the rollicking side to this humming city  on the Mississippi. There are a few great shots of Mardi Gras, Bourbon  street, Cafe De Monde and the French Market. But I want more! <br />Again,  thank you to Don Mitchell for reviewing so well.

Feel mad when your numbers do not pop in a multi-million dollar lottery?  Shredding the ticket to bits like an overdue bill.  Does envy creep through  your gut while glimpsing that cherry red Porsche purring effortlessly by  your 8 year old Toyota? Rationalizing, well, at least yours is paid for.   Well, don't. In &quot;The Golden Ghetto&quot;, we get shocking glimpses  into lives of some of the rich and famous which were left on the cutting  room floor with Robin Leach. Apparently it is not all champagne wishes and  caviar dreams.<br />Authoress, Jessie H. O'Neill, knows of what she writes.  Her father was a workaholic with no time for his family. Resulting in a  common money disease referred to as affluenza. The disease of money. Can  you imagine? Wealth CAN be a disease causing specific dysfunctions of those  feeling entitlement, it is theirs for the asking, not earning, coveting the  guilt that lies therein.<br />In this book, which is provocatively written, we  become privy to Ms. O'Neill's personal story. She is the grandaughter to  Charles Wilson. I had never heard of him and was surprised to learn he was  past president of General Motors and served as Secretary of State to  President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The manner in which she reveals family  secrets of disorders--alcoholism, drug abuse, manic-depression, suicides,  lack of fulfillment leading to wanton irresponsible behavior, makes the  Kennedy family look *curse*-less.<br />As I read her story and others she  divuldged, newsworthy names began to surface. Kurt Cobain, Elvis, JFK, Jr.,  Princess Diana, Freddie Prinze, Sonny Bono, Hugh Grant, Boy George--such  odd behaviors and risks from  people we seem to think, have or had it all.  How could they be unhappy? How could they take such risks? The very fact  that today we have almost one new millionaire every 63 seconds--usually due  to tech stocks and or options. And, the written information regarding  lottery winners and their usual fall from grace withina years time of  sudden wealth, makes this well written book extremely timely.<br />I enjoyed  this psychological profile of a disease which has no immunization. It does  have a cure. Possibly why the authoress is a therapist herself. <br />Highly  recommended for medical or feel better &quot;I am not rich&quot;  reading.<br />--CDS--	2000-08-11

Holder holds fast to two tests of a euphemism: 1) It must be  a substitute for blunt precision or disagreeable truth 2) That a euphemism  once meant, or still does mean, something else entirely different. In  short, a way to be politically correct. A softer, kinder, way of speech so  to speak.<br />In this work of almost 500 pages, we learn the art of not  saying what we mean. Some are almost common language now. Such as  &quot;bowel movement&quot;, &quot;working girl&quot;, &quot;Native  American&quot; and &quot;downsizing&quot;.

This inspiring book has been a catharsis for  them--and for me. The third edition, from the early '90's, still evokes the  child in all of us. Sometimes, simple gets the point across easier.<br />Using  a manner of a friendly family Doctor or confidant, Earl Grollman writes  about how to cope with the grief, the anger, the hopelessness of it all.  Death is never easy--especially if there were unresolved issues.  Illustrations and ideas seem to work for adults as well as the younger set.  We find &quot;remembering aloud&quot; our best moments with those we have  lost in the last few years to be of great importance in an ongoing healing  process. Vocalizing to each other our rememberances brings on a gush of  needed tears, shadowed smiles and sometimes loving laughs.<br />&quot;Talking  About Death&quot; helps heal the child in all of us.

Either  tossed and forgotten or picked up and treasured. As quoted in  &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;--death ends a life, not a  relationship.<br />This is a blessing of a book. Collective stories of others,  careful research into the subject, ethical debates over the stigmatism of  suicide, and even the dealings with the coroner and police--makes this a  complete suicide survival guide.

The threat--to kill one hostage an hour  unless demands are met.<br />Enter Arthur Potter, the FBI's senior hostage  negotiator. Killer Lou Handy may just be Potter's downfall.

Tales of children being huddled away from abusive  parents, by an anitiquated legal system--only to be delivered right into  the hands of foster parents leading to continued abuse, degradation,  neglect, injury, and even death.<br />No, this is not easy reading. It is a  needed slap in the face reality of a read. Murphy writes, &quot;In the  present system, the parent's victim status becomes more important than the  child's neglect.&quot; Unlike some other books by social critics, this  compelling book offers solutions; such as restructuring child welfare  bureaucracies into two agencies, one to provide services and the other to  investigate child abuse.<br />The story of the five children placed in foster  care and found to be barely living in a basement, was more than shocking.  These children would tell their social worker everything was okay, lying to  prevent further abuse. A system that rips everything away from these  orphans of the living--their hopes, dreams, hearts, and souls desperately  needs revamping.<br />How can we complain about the children of today, when  our legal systems are only serving procreation of our citizens of tomorrow?  We can do something, save one child at a time. We must start somewhere. Be  a mentor, be a Guardian Ad Litem in your local county, be a saviour.<br />A  rivetingly raw book.

Is there something up  there besides the Vikings to evoke such horrifically fascinating plots?  <br />&quot;Intense&quot; is an understatement for this perfect blend of  crime, mystery, judicial proceedure, and serial killer genres. Solid as ice  Detective Sam Kovac and partner, sassy wise-cracking Nikki Liska, from  &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; are back. <br />This time, these two hard-edged  cops put their lives and careers on the line while involved in a potential  suicide of an officer from Internal Affairs, Andy Fallon. Andy was gay.  Andy told his infamous father &quot;Iron Mike Fallon&quot; he was gay. And  Andy was found hanging in front of a mirror smeared with two words--I'm  Sorry.<br />Super sleuthing divulges secret cases from the past, Police  Department hush-hush cover-ups, a retiring Captain Ace Wyatt who just might  be more than Hollywood bound, another recent murder of a gay police  officer, and deep delving into family issues.

Crime family Ramos has set him  up and plucky Stephanie Plum is there for him--in any way he wishes!<br />You  know, I'm thinking this series would work on T.V.

Her invitation to a grand party with the  elite did not mention her capture and entrance to a secret world of sexual   slavery. Delving deeply into Domination and submission, Isabella learns  well. She returns to New York as a dazzling, not so naive,  &quot;Belladonna&quot;. And vows to have her own way with her captors from  England.<br />Some of this novel is slow, bogged down in details and  dialougue. But, &quot;Belladonna&quot; is a passionate kinky poison treat  of a read.<br />Thank you for your interest &amp; comments--CDS	2000-07-23

In one opening line, &quot;The first time my husband hit me I was 19 years old&quot;, we are swept into a seductive,  violent, tense world.<br />I was engrossed by this woeful tale. Yet, I found  myself frowning most of the time. Lines forming on my face from a bit of  bogged down writing, but mainly from the subject matter.  I prefer to read  more escapism, but once in a while I need to slap my reality senses into  order.<br />A good read, especially in the beginning. If it helps one woman  escape this sort of brutality, Ms. Quindlen has done her job well.<br />Thank  you for your interest &amp; comments--CDS	2000-07-23

Enjoying &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot; led me to this short and sweet love story.<br />In this novel, we meet Noah Calhoun. A  rugged scamp of a man who is still yearning for the past love of his life.  Allie Nelson is now a socialite engaged to a wealthy attorney. Alas, she  also craves her long ago romance with the boy that took her breath  away.<br />Sparks does a complete job of making a twist on an old plotline.  Including conundrum victories and glimpses into aging human behavior. As I  was pulled into these characters lives, the haunting song &quot;Where've  You Been&quot; by Kathy Mattea, kept whirlpooling in my mind.<br />So, if you  are in the mood for action adventure, look elsewhere. If you want a simple,  sweet, enduring love story.....grab your hankie and indulge.<br />other  reading suggestions: &quot;The Last Valentine&quot; by James Pratt<br />Thank  you for your interest &amp; comments--CDS	2000-07-22

In &quot;Point Of Origin&quot;, there are several plots twisting and turning the reader. Sick psycho Carrie returns from &quot;Body Farm&quot; to  threaten Kay and retired FBI boyfriend Benton Wesley. Add a special  assignment from the government, to now help forensically in the case of a  burnt to the ground horse farm...including a body, and Dr. Kay has her  hands full.<br />I enjoyed this book. However, at times I felt the scenes were  perhaps overwritten, clogging down the penned rich rhythms we are  accustomed to. Or, maybe there was just TOO much going on.....rather  dizzying, like several kittens bouncing about with frazzled balls of  colorful yarn.<br />Ms. Cornwell apparently was getting EVERYTHING in to  complete this series. And for Scarpetta fans, there are some sad endings  besides the series.<br />Still a classic Cornwell chiller.<br />Thanks for your  interests &amp; comments--CDS	2000-07-22

How do I even attempt to feel their loss? And, how, how do I keep my two teenage sons safe? <br />While  taking in &quot;Rachel's Tears&quot; I cried, I smiled, I celebrated this  young womans fiercely guided life. As I read her journal entries, gazed  upon her sketches, an unanswerable question persisted, &quot;why&quot;? Why  would two evil boys do what they did at Columbine in 1999? And if it  affects me, a total stranger, as a wrecking ball smashing solidly and  squarely into an impenatrable fortress.....how, oh how do they go  on?<br />Tonight we watched 20/20 on T.V. and witnessed some of what they have  gone through. We watched as a family. We cried as a family. And we prayed  as a family.<br />We all have certain burdens to bear. Rachel's life was  short, but her families memories, their dedication to God, their inner  strength will forever remind me not to complain but to sustain.<br />A  powerful read.

After some shennanigans from the government with Jack's  galpal, he willingly searches for a killer who leaves no clues.

In, &quot;The Long Road Home&quot;, readers are witness to a profound story of victory of the human spirit.  <br />We meet Gabbie Harrison at a young age and follow her harrowing journey  from vile physical child abuse by her wealthy mother, irritating ignorance  from her father, and a 10 year old girl who is then totally abandoned into  the hands of a strict yet loving Mother Superior.<br />It is here at St.  Matthews Gabbie meets Father Joe Connors. Going against all they know to be  immoral, a relationship of impossibilities flowers.

This psychopath makes them all look like suicides.  Using the fewest of clues, Dewitt begins his relentless search.

Yep, I had the Kleenex with aloe  handy.<br />However, &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot;, seemed more like  trippingly slow steps of two teenagers finding each other while pushed  together during a Christmas play.<br />I wanted to like this book, I really  did. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was an unoriginal plot of boy meets girl,  boy starts to take on lifes impending adulthood. I just could not wrap  myself around Landon Carter and Jaime Sullivan.<br />I might attempt to read  it again...when I am in the mood for Sparks' emotional coupling of humor  and remembrance.

He and co-author Tom Block are right on target in this updated  and re-released disaster novel. <br />In &quot;Mayday&quot;, we meet John  Berry, a survior of an errant missle blasted Straton Flight 52. He is a  private pilot and takes on the responsibilty of landing this flying coffin.  The dead and brain damaged souls aboard are grahically depicted as  decompression at 66,000 feet would dictate. <br />I am an avid DeMille fan and  have been working my way through all of his books since &quot;The Lions  Game&quot;.

However, Simon Clark's debut left me numb and nauseous. Not from the horror. From his overly descriptive clumbsy writing, (how many ways should one describe  clouds?), repetitive cliches, and lack of control of leading the reader to  emotional curiosty.<br />In &quot;Nailed By The Heart&quot; we meet a family  that buys a seafort in England. A village of weird characters. And the Saf  Dar. A supposed religious group of horrific murderers. Half way through the  book I found myself saying, &quot;Ok, get on with it already!&quot; and  skipped to the last chapter. It was as if I had not missed a thing. The  conclusion is sappy.

The chaos of a viciously vengeful Libyan psuedo-defector continues from  there.<br />I liked this book.

And the sidebar  mentions from some of Demilles other books mixed in from &quot;The Gold  Coast&quot; and &quot;Plum Island&quot; were good to see.<br />Parts of it I  read out loud to my husband, He loves Corey's sometimes sexist but funny  ways.
