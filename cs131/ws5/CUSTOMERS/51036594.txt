The Catholic Youth Bible (CYB) is a misguided attempt to interpret Sacred Scripture according to modern standards in an effort to make the Bible, and the Catholic Faith, more appealing to young people. Generally, young people see through such attempts to make religion fashionable, and rightly find them unappealing. Furthermore, by pandering to religious pluralism and other decidedly un-Catholic ideas, and by ambiguously presenting Church teaching, the CYB compromises the Catholic Faith. Thus, in an effort to make the Catholic Faith appealing, the CYB is neither appealing, nor is it Catholic. A young person of high school age is better served with an unadulterated Catholic Bible and a catechism of the appropriate reading level.<br />The CYB highlights the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) with over 650 short articles. These articles are designed to teach something about the Bible or make suggestions about how to live these teachings.<br />The CYB claims to be Catholic because \\"its introductions and articles reflect Catholic interpretation of the Bible and [because it] contains all seventy-three books and letters that form a complete Catholic Bible (pg. vii).\\" Throughout the CYB, however, \\"Catholic Christians\\" are referred to in the third person and their \\"beliefs\\" are presented as subjective opinion. Some articles, under the heading, \\"Catholic Connections\\", are intended to show the biblical basis for some Catholic beliefs and practices. This heading is rather confusing in that it implies that only certain sections, and not the whole of Sacred Scripture, have a connection to the Catholic Faith. <br />Other articles, intended to show how the Bible is \\"multicultural\\", represent distinct cultural perspectives. These articles introduce irrelevant cultural experiences, traditions, and poetry. Some even present non-Christian religious ideas and prayers. Ironically, these articles foster racial fixation in the context of Sacred Scripture which otherwise transcends racial difference. <br />Also, some of the \\"Live It\\" and \\"Did You Know\\" articles contain unnecessary and disturbing images. One article, for example, gives an account of the group rape of a teenage girl (pg. 43 No Way Shechem!). Another considers what menstruation must have been like for women of the Old Testament (pg. 123 Monthly Periods).<br />Ostensibly a version of the bible that will appeal to \\"modern\\" Catholic Youth.   But it doesn`t take much searching to find objectionable content in the CYB. According to the CYB the author of Sirach is \\"sexist\\"  (pg. 810 The Sexism of Sirach), the author of John's Gospel is anti-Semitic (pg. 1249 \\"The Jews\\" in the Gospel of John), and the sin of the Sodomites is ``inhospitality`` (pg. 25 Be Kind To Strangers). The rest is predictable. There is far more error in this Bible than I could possibly address in this space.<br />As the CYB purports to be Catholic, however, let us take a look at how it presents Church teaching. On page 1237 under the heading \\"Catholic Connections\\" and titled \\"The Eucharist\\" we find, \\"In Luke's account of the Last Supper, Jesus asks his disciples to remember him and all that he did, as they share the loaf of bread that he identified as his body given for us and the cup of wine that he identified with the New Covenant sealed by his blood.\\" This is not consistent with Church teaching, which states \\"by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the wine into the substance of his blood (Catechism of the Catholic Church #1376).\\" <br />I do not recommend this Bible to anyone, for any reason.

The presence of sin in the Church is not news.  However, to use this reality in a dishonest way to \\"reel-in\\" people's emotions is, simply put, an objective evil.  However, the phenonema of people believing anything and everything they read is nothing new.  As another truly Catholic author, G.K. Chestern wrote early in the last century, \\"Statements are made so plainly and positively that men have hardly the moral courage<BR>to pause upon them and find that they are without support.\\"<br />And that's really the question here; do the things cited by Caroll support in any way the thesis he tries to propose?  The reality of original sin, no matter how tragic, has nothing to do with women's ordination.  The reality of original sin, no matter how tragic, has nothing to do with accepting gays.  The reality of original sin, no matter how tragic, has nothing to do with needing to accept liberal textual criticism and an entirely pointless, \\"Jesus seminar-esque\\" Jesus.  It also has nothing to do with the divine truth of Catholic doctrine, and all that derives itself from that.<br />The problem is that he, like Gary Wills, uses the faults of individuals (even in collective) as a vehicle to promote completely unrelated ideas; particularly his vision of a church which is in no way distinguishable from liberal, modernist, secular society.  The church would effectively cease to be the City of God on earth, but rather become a building where nothing significant or worthwhile takes place.  It would be a place where the ideas preached inside are simply re-statements of ideas passed around by the media and on the streets.  Catholicism, in short, would simply become another new-age \\"feel good\\" religion, and not the religion where people are convicted of their sins, and are moved to repent (which involves the acceptance of immutable and objective - not subjective and relativistic - moral codes), trust in Jesus, and have their lives changed for the sake of following Jesus, no matter how little society at large thinks of you.  THIS is the legitimate mission of the Church.  The mission of the Church is not to conform itself to the wisdom of this age (Rom. 12:12).<br />And if you really think about it, this is the logical deduction of the Church that liberals envision; a Catholic Church that is entirely indistinguishable from secular society at large.<br />If you want some intelligent commentary on the real issues, their roots, and VALID, Godly solutions, I suggest reading Michael Rose's \\"Goodbye, Good Men\\", and George Weigel's \\"The Courage to be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church.\\"	2002-09-05

Books	4	38	40	N	N	Recommended even though newer collections are available	...This is an excellent resource, no two ways about it.  I find myself using it all the time, looking up things I find quoted in books, tracts, etc.  I found it very convienent to be able to get the whole set at once, and I might add, for a very good price ....<br />Just a caveat: this is not, and does not advertize itself as a complete compendium of the writings of the authors represented in this set.  For instance, Origen, Jerome and Athanasius are given particularly brief treatments, as are most of the writers presented in volumes 25-38.<br />...  This is a great resource, but some 120 years after initial publication, the body of manuscripts and scholarship used in translation has been improved upon.  This cannot be looked upon as an intrisic weakness in this series, but rather an effect of aging which falls on all older works which rely on a body of historical writings which are under constant study.<br />Regarding the introduction essays, I don't have a huge problem with them.  Not all of them are openly polemical.  This was compiled by Protestants, so one should not be surprised to find pro-Protestant essays therein.  One cannot possibly confuse these with the writings of the Fathers themselves, and can be easily skipped.<br />However, I did pick up a fair amount of attempted \\"damage control\\" in the footnotes, i.e. the footnote on Irenaeus' Against Heresies 3:3:2.  Other examples could be cited.<br />In any case, I am not citing these things to \\"unpromote\\" the work, but simply discussing the points ....  I am aware that there are newer translations of these writings available, but are only available piecework and for much more money.  <br />This is indeed a great place to start, but people wanting more complete writings and/or more current scholarship might want to consider the Ancient Christian Writers series.	2002-03-23

Before I begin my review, allow me one caveat: the casual reader, to be sure, who stumbles upon this work after seeing it quoted in popular apologetics books (i.e. Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism), risks being in over his/her head completely.  Such was the case with me about 3 and a half years ago when I was starting out my study of doctrine and history.  For 3 years this book sat on my shelf, all attemts that I made to read it having failed because I lacked the proper foundation.  It was only after I spent considerable time studying history and especially the ancient heresies that I was able to grasp what Newman was saying.  The following example, taken from a passage found on pages 314-315, should demonstrate my point:<br />\\"It is very observable that, ingenious as is their theory and sometimes perplexing to a disputant, the Monophysites never could shake themselves free of the Eutychians; and though they could draw intelligible lines on paper between the two doctrines, yet in fact by a hidden fatality their partisans were ever running into or forming alliance with the anathematized extreme. Thus Peter the Fuller the Theopaschite (Eutychian), is at one time in alliance with Peter the Stammerer, who advocated the Henoticon (which was Monophysite). The Acephali, though separating from the latter Peter for that advocacy, and accused by Leontius of being Gaianites (Eutychians), are considered by Facundus as Monophysites.  Timothy the Cat, who is said to have agreed with Dioscorus and Peter the Stammerer, who signed the Henoticon, that is, with two Monophysite Patriarchs, is said nevertheless, according to Anastasius, to have maintained the extreme tenet, that \\"the Divinity is the sole nature of Christ.\\"  Severus, according to Anastasius, symbolized with the Phantasiasts (Eutychians), yet he is more truly, according to Leontius, the chief doctor and leader of the Monophysites. And at one time there was an union, though temporary, between the Theodosians (Monophysites) and the Gaianites.\\"<br />That being said...<br />The premise of this book is to examine the developments of doctrine that have occured both within and without the Catholic Church since the earliest times.  In the earlier part of the book, Newman spends considerable time discussing the methods used by the Anglican Divines to discern developments from corruptions, and shows how their methodology is flawed, and how in many cases they rejected things which had more early concensus than things they accepted.  <br />Other points he makes throughout the book is the treatment of the Catholic church by the various heretical sects and dissident groups.  He shows how despite their disagreements with each other, they were usually united in opposition to the Catholic Church, using the same blasphemous phrases to describe her as the Reformers did and many Protestants continue to this day, while the latter group would generally accept the body accused of these things as orthodox in earlier times.<br />After his rather long introduction, so to speak, Newman lays out his seven principles which will serve to distinguish developments from corruptions: 1. Preservation of Type, 2. Continuity of Principles, 3. Assimilative Power, 4. Logical Sequence, 5. Anticipation of its Future, 6. Conservative Action on its Past, and 7. Chronic Vigour.  Newman then goes on to examine each of these in detail (though the first 4 are examined in far greater detail than the latter 3), showing how doctrinal developments in the Catholic Church throughout history, as well of those proposed by groups deemed heretical, have fared when these 7 principles are applied to them.<br />The details of his agruments are covered well in other reviews, and indeed a thorough examination of them cannot be done justice here in my 1,000 word limit.  Suffice to say that this book will be guaranteed to give the informed reader, be he symathetic or skeptical, something to ponder seriously, as this is indeed the most comprehensive work written on the subject of the development of doctrine.	2002-03-20

True, its a whole 7 years too late in coming (sounds ominous, doesn't it? Isn't something supposed to happen seven years after the rapture spoken about in Left Behind?  I guess this series hasn't been released in real time)... but hey, it needed to be written.<br />I'll share some of my favorite passages:<br />Page 19: \\"We left Buford surprised in the big tube part of the airplane. We join him again now. He walked out of the cockpit in time to suddenly see a woman walking toward him, but more importantly, towards the lav, which is what people in the know call the airline restrooms. She had the kind of look that attracts TV Baptists. Her hair was big, bleached, and beautiful. Her face was tastefully painted, and her outfit was a very classy evening dress. Buford smiled. For a split second he thought neither of Haddie nor his wife. His mind and eyes walked toward him in slow motion. Suddenly she was gone. Her dress was empty and it slid down onto the floor under a pile of blonde wig. Buford stopped. He was surprised. The people on either side of the aisle were surprised, at least those who were still there. Some of them had dissapeared as well.\\"<br />Page 30 and 31: \\"...there are only two options when writing apocalyptic literature,\\" Buff said. \\"The first is as follows: When writing dialogue, at the end or in the middle of every line the author must insert the phrase 'he said', 'she said', or someone's name followed by the word 'said.' Of course, real authors of fiction prefer the word 'said' to all the many creative options that an amateur will come up with. But they will lace it through their dialogue, not distracting from what is being said by saying 'said,' but using it so the reader can keep track of the speaker. Only the good apolalyptic writer, or an eigth grader writing for an assignment, will give you the 'said' phrase following every speech. But there is also the other option. The second option is to leave the speaker completely unnamed. This is useful because he is it hip and keeps the reader interested, because he is always trying to discern the speaker. It goes something like this:<br />'Why?'<BR>'What?'<BR>'Where have you been?'<BR>'Nowhere in particular. How is the Rapture treating you?'<BR>'Well, the traffic is rough.'<BR>'Is your mother still a masseuse?'<BR>'Sure, you need a rubdown?'<BR>'Are you ready for a physical relationship?'<BR>'No.'<br />\\"In this way the reader is forced to go back and count lines in order to discover the speaker.\\"<br />The humor extends to more serious points, which subtly point out the gross errors in dispensational eschatology and theology. Page 43 points out their neo-gnostic leanings: \\"She got on her knees and crawled to a window. It wouldn't open. In a last reaction against the evils of the material world, she kicked the glass and crawled out into the sky.\\"<br />Thankfully the author doesn't only parody the two dimensional characters and amateurish dialogues. He also points out the errors of dispensational theology and makes it fun to read about. <br />Finally, since I've been among those who shakes his head when I see so many people reading the \\"Last Days Goofiness\\", I really needed to read this book to get a good laugh. The last book that I read that was even remotely funny was \\"An Objetive, Scholarly History of the Early Church\\" by Dave Hunt.	2002-01-14
US	51036594	R3R9H8HMRQIEWE	1931047170	34724783	The Listener's Bible NIV	Books	4	101	130	N	N	5 for delivery, 4 for content, 3 for translation = 4	I purchased this for several reasons, but mostly because I love Scripture.  Having read most of the Bible at least once, and other parts numerous times, I figured that this would help me keep refreshed, as I listen to it during my frequent 2 and a half hour road trips in my car.  Well delivered Scripture can be a better companion than even good music at times...<br />Max McLean has a wonderful delivery, and the subtle, simple music in the background adds just the right amount of color.  I especially liked his telling of the 4 Gospels.  It sounded real, fresh, but never over-dramatized.<br />As a Catholic, I do have two objections.  One cannot however be considered an objection, as I bought this knowing that it was a Protestant translation, and therefore is missing the Deuterocanonicals.  Alas, I won't have the pleasure of hearing Max recite those; I'll simply have to read the text to keep refreshed :)<br />Third - and this is actually a criticism, is the translation used.  While the choice of the NIV was logical for the producers, as its a popular and easily-readable translation, I do take issue with the way some things are inconsistently translated.  I was actually not aware of a few finer points of translation until I heard this, my previous Scripture studies having used other translations (NAB, KJV, RSV, Jerusalem Bible).<br />While I feel that the NIV is an accurate translation overall, and don't want to accuse the translators of intentional doctoring without a compelling case, there are two words that seem to have been inconsistently translated in order to de-Catholicize the Bible on the two foundational points of Catholic/Protestant contention.  The two words are paradosis and ergon, which mean, respectively, tradition and works.<br />In every single case where faith is stressed when discussing justification, the NIV translates the word ergon as \\"works.\\"  When works are being elevated, the NIV translates the same word - ergon - as \\"deeds\\" or \\"actions\\" (thoughwe should have expected the Greek word poieo if it were correctly translated this way).  See James 2:24.<br />Regarding paradosis, the word is correctly translated as \\"traditions\\" when traditions of men are condemned, but mistranslated as \\"teachings\\" (which is actually didaktikos in Greek) when the adherance to Tradition is commanded (see 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 2 Thessalonians 3:6, and 1 Corinthians 11:2).  However, to be fair, I did notice that in the printed edition of the NIV, the correct translation of paradosis is given in the footnotes here.<br />Every translation suffers at least some from the inherent bias of the translators, but these instances seem too uncoincidental to be innocent.  The entire Catholic/Protestant seperation rests on the issues discussed in these verses; why the need to doctor the text if the issues are as \\"perspicuous\\" as they're proposed to be by some?  In any case, I see no reason to throw the baby out over 4 verses of bathwater :)<br />I do VERY highly recommend this set, as it truly does bring Scripture alive and makes it very accessible to anyone.  Its not hard to find time to listen to CDs, so no more excuses for not reading the Bible!	2002-01-02

Like another reviewer noted, this book reads quickly depite being nearly 600 pages long; I finished in it 5 days.<br />Within the pages you will find everything that is music to conservative Catholic ears.  Modern issues and conflicts, both inside of the Catholic Church, between Catholics and Protestants, and between Theists and Atheists are covered, and apologetic arguments are presented in deep philosophical discussions between characters.  I absolutely loved how the author managed to work these things into the plot and into conversations, in a way that seemed entirly natural and relevant to the plot.<br />The plot itself was believable, with enough tragedy to be realistic and enough &quot;loose ends&quot; to make the reader use his imagination.<br />Some readers have compared this to Dosteovsky; I have dissent, unfortunately.  While this is a fine novel, sure to pique the interest of modern Orthodox Catholics and Protestants alike, the level of description and especially character dialogues were not on par to Dosteovsky.  At times, the conversations seemed mechanical in fact, and lost believability.  While this was of minor concern to me, it does in my view deprive the book of comparison to Dosteovsky.<br />In any case, I HIGHLY recommend this book, as it offers much more than a fictional story: its a sound presentation of the issues facing the Church at this day in age.  I look forward to reading the other books in the series.	2001-12-19

The author gives a very reasonable account of the history of inquisitional methods since Old Testament times, and how the logic of the medieval Inquisition is derived from them.  <br />Special attention is given to the cultural context and concerns facing the Church at the time, how abuses were curbed, and what certain figures did to make sure that the Inquisition did not become a means for clerical abuse and self-interest. <br />One of the best features of this book was the pointing out of errors by past Inquisition historians.  Walsh reveals inherant bias in some writers, and outright ignorance of evidence in some cases.  The chapter on Llorente was particularly helpful.<br />The problem I had with this book was that the author seemed to be a heretic himself, by Catholic standards.  He went so far as denouncing salvation sola gratia.  On page 222 we read, &quot;Was not Luther's doctrine of salvation by grace alone a restatement, with a somewhat different emphasis, of the old despairing dogma of the Alumbrados, the Manichees, the Gnostics, the Buddhists?&quot;<br />I don't know where he was trying to go here - perhaps he meant to say &quot;faith alone&quot;, but salvation sola gratia has always been the infallible dogmatic teaching of the Church (See Council of Trent Canon 1).<br />For things such as this, I hesitate to give this to Protestants.  Though it might help clarify the issues surrounding the Inquisition, it might unnecessarily &quot;confirm&quot; their worst fears regarding the Catholic doctrine of justificiation.  I simply penned some notes into the margin of this page pointing this out.  <br />Overall a good book, but it has its flaws.	2001-12-19

I was greatly interested in this book when I saw it, because I am interested both in the study of apologetics and Christian theology, as well as comparative religions.  As far as my study of comparative religions goes, I prefer to let the adherents of those religions speak for themselves.  So when I saw this book, which is authored by one Evangelical Christian and one Mormon, I was sold.<br />Though the authors are very direct and honest about how strongly they feel about their positions (as they should be), they are unbelievably charitable.  There is a lot to be learned here, not just for those interested in learning the language the other groups speak and how they define some terms differently, but in learning the language we all should speak; that of love.<br />My only complaints come in some factual blunders committed by the authors.  Some of them are pretty big too, and for the most part show an ignorance of history.  <br />The first big one occurs on page 39 when Bloomberg is discussing how the canon of Scripture came about, he refers to the councils of Hippo and Carthage as &quot;Ecumenical&quot; councils.  This is simply untrue.  The councils were actually provincial or local councils, and certainly did not include all of the world's Catholic Bishops as do ecumenical councils.  This may seem minor, but the distinction is actually massive in regards to the authority of the council's decisions.<br />The next red flag came about on page 57, where Robinson is discussing what it means for Scripture to be inspired.  In the last full paragraph of the page, he states what are, in my firm opinion, ideas contrary to 2 Peter 1:20 (even though he quotes that verse in the next paragraph).  My advice therefore is simply to refer to that passage carefully as you read this page.<br />Moving to page 61, Robinson claims that &quot;Mormons do not believe that the fullness of the Gospel has been available to Orthodox Christians since the 2nd or 3rd century.&quot;  My problem isthat I have read many of the writings of the early fathers - and even those which are pre-Nicene in origin sound completely orthodox to me, a devout Catholic.  If nothing in those &quot;pre-apostasy&quot; writings sound any different doctrinally than things written in the 4th, 5th, 13th, or even 19th or 20th centuries, just what did they get wrong, and where do purely Mormon ideas appear in those early writings?  I think this a major problem that more Mormons need to address.<br />A valid point that Robinson makes on page 69 seems to be a valid challenge only to those who adhere to &quot;sola Scriptura.&quot;  He asks Bloomberg, &quot;Give me some biblical criteria of canonicity that exclude LDS Scriptures, and you create a problem for me.&quot;  His point, which Bloomberg actually concedes, is that Protestants have no Biblical criteria to declare a closed canon, at least in principle.  This is another case where it seems that neither author ever considers that the Catholic Church might be the actual Orthodox Christian body.  In any case, this question would have been painfully easy for a Catholic to answer, and literally impossible for a Protestant.  The Canon is closed because the Church established by Christ acted upon the teaching authority given to it by Jesus Christ and infallibly declared it so.  <br />From this point forth I found little objectionable in the book, and even applauded Bloomberg's implicit acceptance of the idea of the development of doctrine on page 126, regarding the Trinity.<br />Overall an excellent book, but like all things, this should simply be a starting point for more serious students of comparative theology.<br />I wish a book such as this existed between Evangelical Protestants and Catholics.	2001-10-04

While I am not a Baptist (but at one time was affiliated with a non-landmark Baptist Church), my interest in this book was not so much for the purpose of refuting landmarkism, but to examine the various Christian or quasi-Christian bodies deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, and heralded as heroes of &quot;true christianity&quot; by  Foxe's book of Martyrs, Dave Hunt, and the others who, denying that the Catholic Church is a Christian body, have to stay faithful to the words of Christ in Matthew 16:18 (and in doing so, label gross heresies and anti-Christian groups as &quot;true Christians&quot;, calling that which is evil good).  <br />The scholarship is excellent, as McGoldrick is careful to use original sources when possible, and when not, he honestly addresses the credibility of his secondary sources and is careful to extensively footnote everything.<br />For this purpose I am greatly indebted, as the book is useful to this end as well.  The fact that McGoldrick misunderstands Catholic soteriology can be forgiven, as that was not the scope of this work.  I highly recommend this to every honest Christian, regardless of denominational affiliation.	2001-06-19

In this, Patrick Madrid's newest book, the author gives some practical advice from personal experience, the wisdom of the saints, and the Word of God itself.  <br />Some of the things which are dealt with are preperation, examination of personal motives and conscience, and different situations one will deal with in the field of apologetics.  Moreover, Madrid instructs the reader in dealing with frustrations, remind them always that it is the Holy Spirit, not the evangelist, who does the actual conversions, and therefore trust must be put first and foremost not in self, but in Him.<br />One of the better features of the book is the recommended reading list at the end.  Divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced, it should prove to be very useful to budding apologists and those who simply have a desire to learn.<br />My only gripe is this: the text is poorly formatted.  The right-hand columns are not justified, which makes the book look unprofessional, and this is really unheard of from professional publishing houses.  Hopefully they will fix this for the next printing.	2001-06-19

Scott Hahn is back again with another book that while new, has a certain air of familiarity to it.  This could justifiably be called a compendium of several of his other works, revised with an injection of the friendly writing style Dr. Hahn adopts in book form.  Much of the material can be found in EWTN's library, as transcripts from a series of videos he did several years back.<br />In any case, the book offers and explanation and apologia for all of the Catholic Marian dogmas.  A large part of the book's focus is on typology, a very effective angle to use when dealing with this issue, and for me, the most convincing.  Added to this are the standard Catholic apologetic arguments.<br />Surely, like any work of apologetics written by any religious body, the arguments will convince some, and others will be unmoved.  However, nobody can doubt that this is a book that Dr. Hahn wrote out of love for our mother, and our Divine Father and Brother.<br />I do wish that he had addressed some doctrines in more depth, such as the assumption.  At the end of the book he mentions an out of print work which I've been so far unsuccessful in finding. The main arguments in favor of the assumption are given in his account of a conversation he had, but it leaves the reader wanting.  Also, hearing his take on the current issues (co-redemptrix, for instance) would have been interesting.<br />The book is however worth reading, but as the jacket suggests, this is more effective when paired with a sort of Bible study.  Its not effective as bed-side reading, and though easy to read quickly, a lot would be lost if a reader does not study the verses brought up in the book.<br />While this is a good book, I enjoyed A Father Who Keeps His Promises and The Lamb's Supper much more.	2001-05-23

I came to know more about God's love in this 240 or so page book which I was able to read in two evenings than I have in volumes of systematic thoelogy...<br />In what is perhaps one of the most encouraging books I've ever read, Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe of Roe vs. Wade) shares with us the story of her upbringing, her involvement in the (in)famous Supreme Court case, and how she was used both by the men who caused her to desire an abortion, and ironically(!), the people who she turned to for help.<br />In the end, it was the love of Christ expressed through a group of Christian pro-life activists who moved their office next to her abortion clinic who started to soften her heart.  Building on a friendship with a young girl named Emily, Norma befriended her former arch-enemy, and in one culminating moment, decided to give her life to Christ.<br />The later parts of the book are concerned with the reaction she received from her former cohorts and the liberal media, and exposes the double standards employed when people don't tow the liberal line during interviews and such.<br />Needless to say, Norma is now a pro-life activist herself, who has founded her own ministry, Roe No More ([...]  <br />If you only have the time to read one book this year - or have one to recommend to someone, this should be it.	2001-04-30

True to form, Hahn used his friendly, conversational writing style in this book as a means of communicating with the reader.<br />In the book, Hahn walks the reader through many of the more important parts of the Old Testament, showing how in every major dealing with man, God played the role of loving Father as a means of caring (and disciplining) His people.  In turn, the reader is led to a realization of the kind of love that God has for us - not the &quot;love&quot; of a courtroom judge, but rather, the love of a father in a family room who treats his people as His children.<br />Also in the book, he further demonstrates where some things fulfilled in the New covenant were foreshadowed in the Old (typology).<br />However, the most intriguing part of the book was his chapter about Christ's last words on the cross, &quot;It is finished.&quot;  Truly, the book is worth the price to have a copy of that extremely interesting chapter, and how Christ's words relate to the Eucharist, the sacrafice of the Mass, and the Passover Hogadah.<br />This is sure to be a very pleasant and encouraging read for the Catholic and non-Catholic alike.	2001-04-30

Scepter has done a great service by binding the 4 Gospels and the book of Acts into one very nicely laid out, quality, hardcover volume. The only thing missing from this, as opposed to the individual paperback editions, is the text of the Latin Vulgate. Most people (like myself) won't find that to be a problem, and what's left is the text of the RSV Catholic Edition (not to be confused with the inclusive language NRSV) and the full commentary from the paperback editions.<br />This is the first Bible commentary that I have been absolutely unable to put down. For starters, this commentary, as far as I can tell, is absolutely faithful to the Magisterium, and the explations truly reflect the interpretation of Scripture in light of 2,000 years of Biblical scholarship. Within the commentary, one often finds quotes from Saints, Fathers, and Church documents which address the passage, something that I find indispensible and immeasureably interesting.<br />The work is also extremely well cross-referenced, and provides an excellent opportunity for in-depth study. This is a work intended for those truly interested in deepening their understanding of Scripture in light of the Orthodox Catholic teaching. <br />All in all, this is the best commentary on the Gospels and Acts that I've seen. I only wish that Scepter would release the rest of the NT in hardcover format...	2001-04-24

He tells of his childhood, his relationship with his father and neighbors, and the role God played in his life.<br />In the book are touching stories of poverty outreach projects, his work for Habitat for Humanity, as well as the dilemmas he faced when his Presidential duties conflicted with his faith convictions.  I do believe Carter to be a good example of someone who lives out his faith, and does not simply confess it with his lips.  He has, as Paul said, the three virtues; faith, hope and chairty.<br />Some people will find his somewhat modernist points of views as troublesome.  Conservatives who are uncompromising on such issues as abortion will have mixed feelings about Carter to begin with.  At the same time, this book will be accessible to more people who might be turned off and wouldn't read it were it authored by a more conservative individual.  Its not the best work I've read, but for someone seeking a light read and a feel-good spiritual autobiography, this may be for you.	2001-04-20

It gave me a lot to think about, but my lack of convictions at the time prevented me from putting his ideas into actions.  That came about 5 months later.<br />In any case, Harris has tackled what is indeed a difficult issue for young Christian adults.  What of dating?  He argues that its not sinful in and of itself, it does foster temptation and can lead to sin very easily.  I wholeheartedly agree just based on personal experience and observation of others.  Its really hard to argue with his logic here at all.<br />At the same time, he takes the role of humble messenger, and does not for a moment make the reader feel that he thinks himself to be better than anyone else.  Most of his wisdom comes from past mistakes and personal experience, which makes him very easy to relate to.<br />Some of his points were a bit drastic, but there would certainly be nothing wrong with living up to those things (having your first kiss at the wedding altar, for instance, seems to be a bit much).  In any case, you don't have to agree with everything he says to get something out of this book and apply it to your life.  I highly recommend it for all young Christians, single or otherwise.	2001-04-20
US	51036594	RXA36D7LAG858	0884940624	67668543	Mormon Doctrine	Books	5	149	165	N	N	Excellent, concise resource	First of all, let me start out by identifying myself as a devout Catholic evangelist.  Over the past year, the study of comparative religion has interested me greatly, and at first, my approach to study was marred by the use of unreliable and biased resources.  I made the mistake of trying to learn about Mormons by reading anti-Mormon literature.  However, what I found there (in books such as The God Makers, Kingdom of the Cults, etc) was not only appalingly uncharible and vindictive, but also appalingly deceitful and false!  Unimpressed with their rhetoric and straw men tactics, I decided instead to do what I should have done in the first place; ask the Mormons what they believe.<br />Aside from the BOM and D &amp; C, this is the first resource I purchased.  The layout was impressive - very easy to use, concise, and well cross referenced.  I was at first dismayed at the lack of an index, but that became a moot point since the book is so well laid out.  Furthermore, although I know this is of course not scripture any more than the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas are to Catholics, it does present a good yet fallible summary of, well, Mormon Doctrine.  My only complaint is that McConkie is a bit too brief in covering some points, and doesn't always give references to relevant sections in the canonized books of the Mormon Church.  Because of this, further study is not always easy to persue.  On the pro side of that, this book can rightfully be considered a &quot;primary source&quot; when citing, by and large.<br />While I still disagree with many aspects of Mormon theology, at least now I can be confident that what I am stating on a particular point is actually what the LDS church believes.  Persuing Mormon literature (and conversations with Mormons) prevented me from going down the fiery path of polemics and hatred for Mormons.  As a Catholic, I know all too well what it is like to be on the receiving end of hatred and bigotry which roots itself in misunderstanding.  As someone who is oftentimes on the receiving end of counter apologetics, I know well the difference between mere theological disagreement and outright bigotry.  The distinction makes all the difference in the world when it comes to dialogue.<br />Persual of literature such as this will require some extra effort, yes, but it will also help you obey the commandment not to bear false witness.  There is no excuse for lazy research.<br />Anyway - I fear that this book review had turned into an admonishment for my fellow apologists to be honest.  However, since I think it needs to be said, and it does tie into this book in a sense, I'm keeping it here.  In any case, if you want to learn about Mormonism, don't listen to idiots like Dave Hunt.  Rather, you do well to start here for a good, reliable primer and a lasting resource.	2001-04-10

This book is a great &quot;next step&quot; for those who have only read primers on the issues, such as Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism.  What you will find here is about 600 pages of intense interaction with the Biblical and historical data pertaining to the proper role of Scripture in the life of the Christian believer.<br />The best part, to me, was the section dealing with the famous verses in Scripture that protestants often use to show that the Bible teaches this doctrine.  The arguments are more than adequately refuted, and in some cases, the reader is shown how these verses (especially the case of the Noble Bereans) actually support the Catholic doctrine!  Did not the &quot;less noble Thesselonians&quot; also look to Scripture alone?  Did they, based on their private interpretation, reject the *oral* teaching of Paul? Yet it was the Bereans, who although very wise to make sure Paul's oral Tradition harmonized with Scripture, ultimately accepted a Truth that was not explicitly there: that Jesus Christ of Nazereth is the Messiah.<br />To all those who say that the authors rely on straw-men arguments in the point-counterpoint section, I say this: try reading the book!  The points given in the Point-Counterpoint section, far from being straw men, are VERBATIM quotes from Protestant apologists!  If these protestant apologists do not fairly represent sola scriptura to you, the point of this book is all the more enforced: sola scriptura = doctrinal anarchy.  In the very beginning of the book, the authors acknowledge that there are many definitions of Sola Scriptura.  It would have been  impossible to cover them all in detail.  Rather, they provide arguments that refute all possible definitions of sola scriptura by implication and logical deduction.<br />A very highly recommended read for those who are serious about learning the true Catholic position.  This book will for sure be too weightyfor those who only like to read Pop tabloid theology (Dave Hunt, Jack Chick, Tim LaHaye etc), but is rather a work for the serious inquirer.	2001-04-08

Books	5	19	21	N	N	A true work of understanding and charity	This book was truly the result of what happens when people take their blinders off and look at each other objectively.  Having a shared Catholic/Evangelical authorship made the book very interesting indeed, especially for someone like myself who has deep personal ties in both of these camps.<br />The first part of this book discussed ECT, the Evangelicals and Catholics together pact, being careful to point out what it does NOT say, so that people don't get the idea that its false ecumenism.  It does however go at lengths to explain the areas in which we do fully agree, and therefore can be said to have a common evangel.<br />The middle parts were interesting to me, as they explained sotierology from early and modern viewpoints.  It didn't get too heavy, but it may not be of extreme interest to some readers.  Next, church structure is discussed in a way that should help both Catholics and Evangelicals understand what each mean by &quot;church&quot; and the historical and Biblical reasons them.<br />Lastly was an essay by a man named David E. Bjork, an evangelical who tells of his experience evangelizing Catholics in France.  What is so special about that?  He encourages them to become better Catholics, rather than rip them away from a perfectly valid church, their roots, and their heritage!  This was very heartening for me, as I've thought for some time now that this is how evangelism should be done in Central America and Western Europe.  Further, his efforts seem to be having a good effect.<br />This is an encouraging book that I recommend all Catholics and Evangelicals read.  For those endowed with open mind and a spirit of charity, there is much to be learned from the authors.  I pray that all future cooperation and dialogue is as charitable as this.	2001-04-06

When I was handed this book by a devout evangelical friend, I was a bit skeptical that he was doing so in an effort to &quot;witness&quot; me and my Catholic faith.  Soon after getting into this, I realized that the subject matter at hand was instead something dear to both of us (and to all of us united in Christ).  Since that time, I have become somewhat of an admirer of Hank Hannegraff.  His sincerity and charity, even in points of disagreements, are true models of what the Church should look like.<br />That being said, there was almost nothing in this book that I disagreed with.  As a matter of fact, it was literally FULL of positive citations from Catholic sources (Summa Theologica by Thomas Aquinas, several different works by Peter Kreeft, St. Augustine, St. Jerome, etc).<br />Theologically, he does an admirable job in offering his apology for the doctrine of the resurrection.  On the theological side, I applaud him for emphasizing the importance this event has on the Christian faith.  I hope that modernists and liberals take notice of the fact that if they reject this doctrine, they reject their entire faith, as Paul so clearly said.  The reasons that Paul said this make total sense after reading this book.<br />Concerning historicity, the book is slightly weaker, though he does raise some very valid and thought provoking philosophical and probable arguments in favor of the resurrection. While not bound to convince well informed skeptics, it will serve as an excellent starting point for those skeptics who may be persuaded to dig a little deeper into the subject.  For those who have already been bestowed with the gift of grace, it will serve to deepen their convictions, and grow in their walk with God.  <br />The last section, the Q&amp;A section, was well written, as one would expect from the &quot;Bible Answer Man.&quot;  He covers a lot of great questions, again basing some of his answers on one of my favorite Catholic writers, Peter Kreeft (the work that Hank often cites, &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Heaven, but Never Dreamed of Asking&quot; is a very worthwhile and informative read.<br />The only part I &quot;object&quot; to was a very brief treatise on sotierology :)  Other than that, I really enjoyed this book.	2001-04-06

I first read the original edition, borrowed from a friend, and later purchased the revised edition.<br />One thing that I had hoped would be updated was Kennedy's writing style.  I don't know what he had in mind, but if he considered at all that this book may have been read by informed critics or even marginally intelligent people, he would have refrained from making such absurd claims about the people he cites.<br />Common to this book is such language as &quot;Source x, who is without a doubt the smartest man to ever live&quot;, and &quot;this man, undoubtedly the most brilliant mind of his time...&quot;, etc.  In most cases, he makes these claims about people I've never heard of.  Others I have.  The problem is, when you make such sweeping claims, it hurts your credibility as an objective researcher and writer.  He'd have done better to just cite his sources and give a brief presentation of their credentials and leave it at that.<br />That being said, he does cover a lot of material, and though sometimes he's unable to resist resorting to Bible-thumping, many of his arguments are very good.  I wholly agree, for instance, with his chapter on Moral Absolutes.  Doctrinally, I have very few problems with the book and the defenses he gives.<br />I was a bit troubled by his brief yet harsh treatments of Catholicism.  For instance, he overstates somewhat the happenings of the Inquisition, filing those involved as &quot;non-Christians persecuting Christians.&quot;  I wish he'd have addressed the Peasants Revolt, Protestant witch hunts, and the English reformation to offer some balance, but that is probably wishful thinking.  However, a comment on page 147 is absolutely laughable: &quot;I'm quite sure that no Christian would ever torture anyone.&quot;  Well congratulations, Mr. Kennedy, you just called John Calvin, your mentor, a non-Christian (see: Michael Servetus, tortured and executed by John Calvin in Geneva).  I appreciate your candor in denoucing the father of Presbyterianism - your denomination - as a non-Christian.  I also found that his implication that Catholics are illiterate (p.156) to be absurd and offensive.  Its too bad emotional bias got in the way of scholarly honesty, but sadly this happens all to often  in this camp.<br />I hesitate to give this to anyone, as I believe his writing style is a turnoff that serves to repel, not witness.	2001-04-06

Nobody should find it surprising that this book did not convince such and such friend to convert to Catholicism.  Why?  Because this is not a theololigal treatise on any subject, its a pair of related conversion stories.<br />As with most conversion stories, the answers to the questions raised will be very concise, but in no way complete, nor should they be.  The intent was to document, in more detail than the cassette version of the Scott Hahn conversion story, the initial and later reasons for the conversion.  Yes, some apologetics material is contained within, but nobody should expect it to be thorough.  As I say about several books, this is good &quot;primer&quot; material for those wanting a sort of foundation into Catholic thought and belief before they bury themselves in heavier works which might otherwise go over their heads without having first this foundational background.<br />Overall, the book is a good read, and personally I could hardly put it down.  I could truly relate to what the Hahn's went through, and it was a heartening testimony that two people whose hearts and minds were so hardened to Catholicism, yet they were able to overcome their misconceptions and investigate the Church with an open mind.  The power of God's grace knows no limits indeed!<br />Keeping in mind what this book is supposed to be, and what it is not supposed to be, I heartily recommend it.	2001-04-06

While I don't hold the same affection for this book as I did two years ago, I still view it as a good work overall.  No, its not in any way thorough (its largely a collection of tracts, and each point he discusses have been addressed elsewhere in books going into the hundreds, even thousands of pages), but its an excellent starting point. My biggest problem seems to be with his approach and writing style.<br />First of all, the writing style does come off as a bit harsh at first.  While it can be said that he is going on the offensive against people who are are far less charitable in their accusations (Chick, Swaggert, Brewer, etc), the issues he discusses are not unique to anti-Catholic fundamentalists.  Therefore, I think it would have been better to leave his polemics at the beginning of the book, instead of extending them to the later chapters where doctrinal differences are discussed, since I could envision many very nice, charitable Protestants interpreting his somewhat negative attitude as applying to them, too.  I don't think that this was his intent, but it doesn't rub off well.  However, most Protestant friends who I've loaned this book to don't mind, generally saying &quot;Well I don't mind, it just shows how passionate he is about it.&quot;  Still, it remains a concern to me since I value charity so highly.<br />Secondly, I found some parts to be dissapointing.  The weaknesses were not weaknesses in Catholicism, but rather weaknesses in his research or just laziness.  For example, while he's refuting &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot; by Lorraine Boetter, he rightfully shows how poorly that work was footnoted, and how some charges went completely without documentation.  The problem is, Keating does the same thing.  While discussing the Stossmeyer speech, he rightfully deems it a forgery, but gives no source to back it up. All he had to do was cite Newman Eberhardt's &quot;A Summary of Catholic History&quot;, but strangely, he fails to do this (it is cited in the Catholic Answers Tract entitled &quot;The Anti-Catholic Bible&quot;).  In another part, answering accusations that Catholics believe things with no Biblical support, he retorts that Protestants do the same thing, but offers not examples.  The least he could have done was cite the Canon of Scripture, symbolic eucharist, altar call, The Sinners Prayer, etc., but he did not.<br />Once you get into the &quot;meat&quot; of this book, it gets much, much better.  He does an excellent job of refuting arguments brought forth by fundamentalists who try to re-write church history, or place distinctive Catholic doctrines embarassingly late. Also, he does a fine job supporting the Eucharist, baptismal regeneration, and virtually all disputed Catholic doctrines from scritpure and history.  No, his arguments are not thorough, and in a couple isolated occasions he offers scripture passages that don't really prove his point.  This is a slight weakness in the book, not with the Catholic position.<br />I still recommend that people start here, because it really does a great job of giving an overview of the controversy, and outlines briefly the Catholic defense.  But by all means, don't stop here.<br />Recommended readings:<br />For better treatments of Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura, read &quot;Not by Faith Alone&quot; and &quot;Not by Scripture Alone&quot; by Robert Sungenis.

This book, insofar as accomplishes what it set out to accomplish (outlining the Book of Revelation from a dispensationalist perspective), does a reasonable job. However, I cannot give it any more than 2 stars due to the fact that I found the scholarship practiced during it writing to be appallingly poor. Therefore, my following critique will not be concerned so much with his interpretation of Scripture than with his competency as a researcher. There are plenty of good critiques of the Dispensationalist system of theology out there, and I would have little to add to them. I will recommend a few at the end of this review.<br />On that note, let us examine the question of scholarship in more depth, starting with his treatise on the dating of the book of Revelation. On page 28, he makes a number of inexcusable factual blunders, and even a few blatant misstatements of fact. The paragraph in question:<br />\\"It is difficult to understand why anyone would question the A.D. 95 date for the writing of Revelation when it was so readily accepted by the early church. No other date was offered for almost 4 centuries, and even then it was not taken seriously. Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp (who was a disciple of the Apostle John) wrote Against Heresies around A.D. 180. He is accepted by all scholars as a reliable authority on the first 150 years of Christianity. He wrote that John received the book of Revelation on the Isle of Patmos \\"towards the end of Domitians reign.\\"1 And it is a known fact of history that Domitian was murdered in the year 96. Moreover, he was famous for banishing people to Patmos and other Greek islands. Irenaeus' statement was accepted as accurate by such early church fathers as Clement, Victorinus, Tertullian, Jerome, Eusebius, and others. The fact that he was only one generation removed from the Apostle John has traditionally carried great weight with historians.\\" (LaHaye, Revelation Unveiled, Page 28)<br />I honestly shook my head in disbelief when I read this passage. When I looked up his citation of Irenaeus, I shook my head even more. Now, it is not my place to judge a person's honesty, but as soon as I read this, I immediately had serious doubts whether Tim LaHaye actually read Against Heresies. First of all, he only quotes a mere six words, which he could have easily lifted from another source. Indeed, the footnote does not quote Irenaeus, but rather pages 750-751 of Volume II of Philip Schaff's 8 Volume History of the Christian Church (which oddly is missing from this book's Bibliography). Seeing that I own that set, I looked it up. The quote was not there (I have scanned the two pages from Schaff's History of the Christian Church that LaHaye lists in his footnote (750 and 751), and will e-mail them to you upon request for verification). So in any case, we are left with a secondary source footnote that when checked does not even say what LaHaye claims it does. Perhaps Irenaeus really did say that, but at this point I have no proof. Irenaeus' book, Against Heresies, is rather long, and I haven't read it for about 2 years.<br />But more importantly is that if he had actually read Against Heresies, he would hardly be advocating it as a reliable source on anything except the dating of the book of Revelation (assuming that that quote is actually there). The reason is that it condemns - in harsh words sometimes - views that deviate from what would today be considered to be distinctly Catholic Doctrine - Real Presence in the Eucharist, Baptismal regeneration, Sacramentalism, the Mass, the Primacy of Rome, etc. In other words, though it was written against the Gnostics, Orthodoxy at the time was Catholicism, and the Heresies that Irenaeus writes about derivatively condemn many of the beliefs of LaHaye himself, and Protestantism at large. But oh how I wish that Protestants would take his advice and read Against Heresies! Don't believe me? Consider the following quote and ask yourself if LaHaye would have promoted this work had he read the following passage:<br />\\"But since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the succession of all the churches, we shall confound all those who, in whatever manner, whether through self-satisfaction or vainglory, or through blindness and wicked opinion, assemble other than where it is proper, by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, that church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the apostles. With that church, because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree, that is, all the faithful in the whole world, and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition\\" (Against Heresies 3:3:2)<br />Further scrutiny of this passage reveals even more errors. Notice that he says, while speaking of Irenaeus' writing, that \\"Irenaeus' statement was accepted as accurate by such early church fathers as Clement, Victorinus, Tertullian, Jerome, Eusebius, and others.\\" Fact: Irenaeus, by LaHaye's own admission, wrote Against Heresies around the year A.D.180. Fact: Clement was martyred under the persecution of Domitian, sometime in the late 1st century. Clement could not in his lifetime have accepted a statement allegedly made by Irenaeus some 85 years after his death! In fact, if LaHaye's dating of Revelation is correct, it is questionable if Clement even knew of its existence, since he died at about the same time as its composition.<br />I had the opportunity to ask Mr LaHaye's colleague Thomas Ice about this, and his reply was that Tim must have been referring to Clement of Alexandria. While this is at least chronologically possible, the view also negated, in the writings of Clement of Alexandria's himself. In Miscellanies 7:17, we read, \\"For the revelations of our Lord at His advent, beginning with Augustus and Tiberius, was completed in the middle of the times of Tiberius. And that of the apostles, embracing the ministry of Paul, ends with Nero.\\"<br />So, Clement of Rome was silent on the point because he was not even alive yet when Iraneaus wrote Against Heresies, and Clement of Alexandria clearly supports the Nero-era dating of the book.<br />Another area where LaHaye's wide practice of pseudo-scholarship is evident is his treatment of Catholicism. From reading his sources (which consist of exactly two sensationalistic books, Lorraine Boettner's Roman Catholicism and Alexander Hislop's The Two Babylons), it is clear that LaHaye has never studied Catholicism much outside of what he was taught at Bob Jones University. On page 266, he presents Hislop's The Two Babylon's as a book which was \\"to my knowledge never refuted.\\" Well it's obvious that LaHaye didn't look very hard. Karl Keating deals with it extensively in his book, 'Catholicism and Fundamentalism', and Ralph Woodrow - who himself published a book entirely based on Hislop's thesis earlier in his career, has recanted his errors and written an entire book which is nothing but a refutation of Hislop called 'The Babylon Connection?' Among the absurd claims made by LaHaye through Hislop is that celibacy has no warrant in Scripture, and that nuns are just an imitation of Roman vestial virgins (p. 269). LaHaye's practice of poor scholarship continues (virginity is not and has never been a requirement for entering a convent, and celibacy is absolutely promoted as an ideal in Scripture (i.e. 1 Corinthians 7:6-9, 7:27-38, Matthew 19:10-12)). I could go on, but won't in the interest of space.<br />One final point: as almost all sensationalistic Anti-Catholic works, LaHaye accepts Boettner's list of \\"Catholic Inventions\\" at face value and reproduces them here. I will give him credit for actually citing it though, for few authors do. Catholic Answers has a tract called \\"Catholic Inventions\\" which thoroughly answer this. For example, I think most people would agree that the claim that Rome invented the damnable practice of Anointing the Sick in 526 A.D. is just absurd (no, I am not making this up. He actually makes this claim on page 59). Far from being a damnable invention, the practice is a good one invented by God, as described exactly in James 5:14: \\"Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.\\" I know that many Protestants have historically had an aversion to the book of James, but come on...<br />People, we as Christians are capable of doing so much better than this. It seems as though Christianity is declining along with the rest of society in our ability to think critically. In Plato's Apology, Socrates defines a fool as someone who, on virtue of being skilled in one thing, thinks himself skilled in everything. Wisdom therefore comes with one's realization of their deficiencies. Timothy LaHaye, no doubt, knows a great deal about dispensationalism. He should not be considered an authority on Patristics and much less on Catholicism.ith Augustus and Tiberius, was completed in the middle of the times of Tiberius.

US	51036594	R1VOFZM4I966JS	0801038758	615803186	Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: Agreements and Differences	Books	5	153	163	N	N	Charitable and Fair - but I'm still Catholic :)	I bought this book on a whim one day while browsing books, and I was very pleased with what I found.  I had previously read Catholicism and Fundamentalism by Karl Keating, as well as some books by Scott Hahn, Stephen Ray, among others.  Reading those works, I became familiar with the arguments, and subsequently, the critiques of less than fair polemic works.<br />The positive comments from Catholics on the back cover (no less a figure than James Akin praised the work for its fairness) made me give in and buy it.  The first section was wonderful, presenting the great amount of agreement we have in very charitable terms.  The second section, where differences are discussed, the authors seem to go out of their way to &quot;get it right.&quot;  Most Catholic arguments for a given position are presented, and then refuted in generally kind, charitable terms.  There are some exceptions though, where they leave out the most convincing arguments for the Catholic position.  One glowing example is the chapter on justification.  On page 227, some Catholic Scriptural arguments for their position are presented, and they cite such things as Matthew 5:12, 25:34, Romans 2:6, among others.  Curiously missing from this, and hence never discussed, is James 2.  One has to wonder why they would decline to interact with the one verse in the whole Bible that contains the clause &quot;faith alone&quot;, and condemns it (James 2:24).<br />While I think that many of their arguments are very inadequate, and at times they seem to apply a double standard when quoting the fathers (depending on if the fathers seem to support or refute their positions), others are very well presented.  In fact, their chapter on baptism got me thinking very, very hard.  Wonderful stuff indeed.<br />This work stands miles apart from other works that are often used to refute Catholicism.  In general, other books written in opposition to Catholicism lack scholarship, as if the authors don't want their readers to checkthe sources, but rather just accept what they're presented as fact (oftentimes fabricated out of thin air).  Further, some authors show no interest in presenting the Catholic defense of a given doctrine.  Geisler and MacKenzie go out of their way to footnote everything, present facts fairly, and make a genuine effort to initiate REAL discussion about the issues, and that is something that is greatly needed.  Readers who are truly interested can easily identify and consult the source documents in their own time. <br />This is the book I give to my staunch Protestant friends who need to learn what the Church really teaches, but won't trust Catholic sources.<br />The actual arguments and methodology contained within only merit 4 stars from a scholarly and logically consistent point of view, however, given that this book sets a new standard in dialogue, I have to give it 5.  I truly hope this sets an example for the future of dialogue between Catholics and Evangelicals.	2001-03-15

It may also serve to shed new light on the Liturgy for non Catholic Christians.  For all Catholics who read this, you will never go to Mass with the same attitude again.  You will see it in a whole new, beautifully new light.  This much is guaranteed.<br />Readers familiar with Rome Sweet Home may be overwhelmed by the &quot;weight&quot; of this book.  While not extremely difficult reading, the book's length is misleading.  The book does go into great detail, and the reader would do well to pause every now and again to read the relevant passages that Dr. Hahn cites (and there are MANY of them).  Rome Sweet Home, while a heartening conversion story, is only that; a conversion story.  As such, it was not meant as a theological opus or even a complete explanation of the issues which caused him to convert.  For readers wanting to know about the &quot;exciting, innovate discoveries&quot; Dr. Hahn only talks about in passing in his conversion story, here is your granted wish.	2001-03-12

John Kippley, both in this book and with his his organization, the Couple to Couples League International, has done a great service for Catholic couples during our age of high dissent.  To get an idea of how powerful an argument this book gives, I may mention that this was the book that started Scott Hahn on his path to Catholicism (his review appears on the inside back cover).<br />Kippley proves his case from every conceivable angle; from scriptural covenant theology, from the Magisterium, and from scripture directly.  While he is presenting his case, he does a wonderful job dispelling objections, handling the hard cases, and putting an end to the propoganda that our liberal society pits against what they like to call &quot;Papal roulette&quot;, or Natural Family Planning.<br />I very highly recommend this book for couples, singles, and teachers who are interested in this topic.  Whether you are unconvinced but are sincere in following God's will (Catholic or Protestant), or if you are already convinced and would like a more effective tool with which you can share this teaching with others, this book is for you.	2001-01-18
