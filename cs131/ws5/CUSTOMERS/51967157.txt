The story of the expulsion of the Acadians from what we now call the Canadian Maritimes is told here with a rare combination of passion and objectivity.  Faragher shows how the Yankees and the British, at both the governmental and the individual level, systematically set out to wipe the Acadians from the land -- and from the earth.  Looked at with 21st century eyes, this historic episode is clearly seen as a shameful American story of ethnic cleansing.  Faragher does not call for collective guilt, but for acknowledgement;  yes, this is part of our nations' histories -- Canada, Britain, and the US --it happened here.  This is particularly poignant in 2005, which marks the 250th anniversary of the beginning of Le Grand Derangement, where thousands of children, women and men died and thousands more were deceived, robbed, brutally treated, sent into a most painful exile and in some cases held in de facto slavery.  This is not an easy subject to read -- but it is an important one, and its lessons will stay with me for a long time.	2005-07-23

I'm a fan of Penguin Lives series, which,  tend to give a somewhat alternative -- and fascinating -- view of their subject. Not so with Nuland's Leonardo.  I struggled with Nuland's use of Freud as a reference point for Leonardo, and with his belaboring Leonardo's presumed homosexuality as a reference point for understanding his life.  By the time I made it past this, I admit I didn't give Nuland's manuscript my fair attention. And I'm content leaving it that way.	2005-05-02

This book was ultimately unsatisfying . . . two young men go out into the desert, being so DUMB it is hard to believe.  Almost no water, inadequate supplies, no trail smarts.  They get lost.  One of them dies, and the survivor's story is not very believable.<br /><br />Did he kill his \\"friend\\"?  If so, why?  The law has spoken, the survivor got, as one reviewer put it, \\"a slap on the wrist,\\" and the young man is still dead.<br /><br />The book has to be unsatisfying, because only the survivor knows the truth.  However, as a real-life mystery, the story is interesting.  As a window into the stupidity that sometimes overtakes even relatively intelligent human beings, it's worth your reading time.<br /><br />That said, I've only given it 3 stars, because I wanted more: The writer has obviously done a lot of primary research, but the difference between an okay book and a really good one would have been more analysis; more speculation; more conclusions.  To be fair, the survivor is alive and free, and there may be legal restrictions on what can be said . . . but I wanted more from the writer.  And so the star level stays at 3.	2004-12-23

The book traces the stories of a family of slave owners, their neighbors and friends, and the slaves whose lives are in their hands.  In addition, this incredibly well-researched novel presents a vivid picture of the casual and brutal violence that was part of a society where the majority of its members were legally considered Property.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read, because there are parts of our history that it is more comfortable to gloss over, or to forget.  \\"The Known World\\" contributes to the essential task of remembering, and honoring the courageous men and women whose emancipation was written with fear and blood and pain.	2004-12-23

There are many paths to personal integrity, Lawson seems to say -- don't be so quick to assume that yours is the best way.<br /><br />The novel moves between an academic setting in Toronto and the land of muskeg and mosquitoes that is the far north, the settings of the protagonist's current (and emotionally sterile) life and her emotionally intense and challenged past.<br /><br />If you've spent any time in the Ontario northland, Lawson's prose will paint familiar pictures behind your eyes.  The story's outcome is predictable, and some of the characters are too one-dimensional to be real -- but these flaws don't alter the fact that this book is an enjoyable read.	2004-12-23

Leavitt drew heavily on the autobiography of poet Sir Stephen Spender (World Within World), and Spender took umbrage, such that the lawsuit resulted in the remaining copies of the first edition of \\"While England Sleeps\\" were destroyed.  In this second edition, Leavitt has made what he considers minor revisions, enough apparently to satisfy the terms of the judgment.<br /><br />But the book is still ponderous.  Rather than Sir Stephen Spender's lilting prose, you have Leavitt's self-focused upperclass Englishman who dabbles in love with a working class man.  Leavitt insists the unrelenting sexual details are essential, I might agree if they were well written.  They aren't.<br /><br />Read Spender.  Skip Leavitt.  Unless you're interested in the dynamics of the lawsuit (which is why I gave it two stars, rather than one), this book isn't worth your time or money.	2004-09-06

He's also wedded to using the keyboard instead of a mouse, arguing that memorizing keyboard controls will cumulatively save you a lot of time.

Karen Armstrong is -- here's the word again -- an amazing woman.  Having read all of her other books with the exception of her autobiographies, I envisioned a solid academic, with cadres of graduate students pulling together masses of data for her review.  No -- Armstrong is a theological autodidact!  Her personal religious and spiritual journey has, to paraphrase one of her favorites, T. S. Eliot, said, led her to where she started only to know it for the first time.  The God she ran from as a young adult has come to greet her in a very different form -- but I'll leave the specifics of this reverse quest for you to discover for yourself.<br />Where her earlier work was clever and provocative, Armstrong has matured into one of the most thoughtful liberal religious writers of our day. She recognizes that the world cannot be healed without dialogue, and that you cannot have dialogue without running the risk that YOU may be changed.  &quot;It is not enough to understand other people's beliefs, rituals, and ethical practices intellectually,&quot; Armstrong says.  &quot;You have to feel them too and make an imaginative, though disciplined, identification.&quot; (p. 290.<br />As one might expect from the breadth of her writings, Armstrong draws from the wells of myriad religious traditions, identifying what this reviewer believes to be the enduring truth, the thread that unities all genuine religious searching.  She learns from her own varied experiences, grows from adversity (e.g. a failed PhD thesis; years of undiagnosed epilepsy; and, of course, her much-noted years as a Catholic religious) and confronts both herself and her culture with unfailing honesty.<br />Although Armstrong is far from the end of her journey (one hopes), she has adopted a theology of orthopraxy, which draws her into authentic living, honoring and accepting both weaknesses and strengths.  Armstrong attempts to ground her life in the conviction that &quot;compassion is a habit of mind that is transforming. . . You have to be prepared to extend your compassionate interests where there is no hope of a return.&quot;  This reviewer is particularly delighted by her conclusion, based on her exhaustive research of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, that &quot;fundamentalist movements distort the tradition they are trying to defend by emphasizing the belligerent elements in their tradition and overlooking the insistent and crucial demand for compassion.&quot; (p. 295)<br />These points and many others, emerge in the theological commentary that forms the final chapter in this book.  This chapter alone could form the basis for several month's active discussion.<br />If you read no other spiritual or religious work this year -- make it this chapter.  But be warned -- Armstrong's honest exploration can be dangerous to your complacency!ansforming. . .

He contends that we can choose and/or learn how to be &quot;thrivers,&quot; i.e to move beyond victim or even recovery status, and experience &quot;Stress Induced Growth&quot;. We can grow and be transformed through the pain and suffering of our lives.<br />He cites many examples from his interviews, of people who have indeed experienced what an outsider might call horrific experiences-- and shows how their unique perspective (which he assures us is learnable) has let them create a &quot;good life&quot; despite their problems.<br />Pearsall cites more scientific research that substantiates his position, so the reader who wants &quot;hard data&quot; can follow his references.<br />This is a useful and even inspiring contribution to the Positive Psychology literature -- I gave it a &quot;4&quot; because I wearied of Pearsall's frequent references to his own (significant) crisis experiences.

This is a standard biography, i.e. it starts at the very beginning, lays the groundwork for an understanding of the Mitford sisters' social class and era, then proceeds through to the present, where only two sisters remain alive.  If you're looking for deconstructionism, you won't find it here -- Lovell approaches her subjects with apparent objectivity. In fact, she refutes many criticisms offered by earlier biographers, such as the widely-held assumption that Unity Mitford was Hitler's mistress.<br /> At the same time, Lovell is clear that the family's friendliness toward (and Unity and Diana's unabashed embrace of) Naziism is more than politically incorrect seen from the standpoint of today. Lovell filled in many gaps in my knowledge about the life of the upper class in Britain in the pre- and WWII period, making it easier to understand what has always seemed to me to be the naivete of their politics . . .such as the mother continuing to insist that \\"Hitler was a personable, charming and thoroughly nice man\\" based on a few pre-war social engagements.<br />I love the comment from one British peer (and friend of Jack) that, during his tenure as president, Kennedy did for sex what Eisenhower did for golf.<br />The book moves quickly through less interesting details.  It leaves one with a strong picture of the life of this amazingly diverse family -- and a better understanding of their class and the era in which they lived.<br />I recommend this book highly to biography-lovers and WWII buffs.	2003-09-02

This book came to me highly recommended, so I was doubly disappointed.  Cohen does better in his other books, but this one is &quot;spirituality lite,&quot; big time.  The format is standard for this genre:  A page for every day, with a catchy title.  A quotation to spark your interest . . . his sources are varied, and this part is okay, though not particularly inspiring.  music, contemporary writers, scriptures, with the most prevalent being &quot;A Course in Miracles.&quot;  Then comes a thought-provoking paragraph or two . . . and here the disappointment takes hold.  Cohen tells obviously-created stories which he claims come from his personal experience, or trite examples from the lives of famous people.  Sometimes he quotes stories from world religious traditions without attributing his sources (as on June 12 where he tells the well known Buddhist tale about the man and the tiger, stopping to taste a strawberry as he falls).<br />Next comes a prayer/meditation. These are good.  If you do buy the book, turn first to these italicized sections near the bottom of each page.  May 7, for example, &quot;Spirit of Love, open my heart. Help me to be at peace with all my relationships . . . &quot;  Then an affirmation, and these range from excellent (as on May 7, &quot;I create peace with my loved ones and myself&quot; to the banal (July 10 - &quot;God's timing is perfect.&quot;).<br />Save your money.  Choose another book for your daily meditations.	2002-10-21

Or at least that's how I feel about branching out into new directions, after reading Barbara Winter's excellent book.

Her concept of Multiple Profit Centers, where the alternative to 9-5 is not \\"one big thing\\" but many small ones, is incredibly empowering.  She compares it to the circus performer who keeps a lot of plates spinning . . .tending to one now and then another . . . and if a few crash, just go ahead and set another to spin.

It felt good (that's why he gets two stars).<br />  The movie's out and I expect it will be enormously successful.  I see it, though, as a setup for a more-trendy sequel in which Sparks' writing talent be better used:  the 57-year-old Baby Boomer protagonist who's been carrying a torch all those years finally meets someone -- the woman from the story -- and finds a way of participating fully in the now.  Another three-tissue tale.<br />  BTW (and perhaps a propos of nothing) -- did anyone else notice that Sparks' protagonist is almost exactly the same age as his late parents (Landon Carter is 57 in 1999, therefor born in 1943; his parents were born in 1942.)

The mistress of a 17th century Great House would never have attempted to partner her son and heir with her maid, no matter how desperate she was to see her son married off. Nor would a ladies maid be likely to have the freedom of movement within and without the house that Tobin's protagonist does. The ending was predictable, as was the romantic involvement.

Erlich paints the beauty and complexity of northern Greenland (before reading this book it never occurred to me to think of Greenland as HAVING a &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot;!) and the struggle a tiny minority are having to maintain their ancient -- and sustainable -- ways of life.  I'd classify this first of all as a love story between woman and land, but it is a love story in which the sentient observer is aware of the problems with the beloved, and yet still remains committed.<br />This is not a &quot;been there, seen that, got the T-shirt&quot; travel book -- Erlich is drawn to Greenland no fewer than seven times, in various seasons, and she lives with the people in traditional housing (including tents on the ice).  She encounters the brutality of bureaucracy as well as the incredible hospitality of the Inuit -- and at the same time she does not shrink from the pervasive alcoholism and domestic violence that are a sad feature of northern life, nor does she neglect to mention the impact even in Greenland of the growing pollution in &quot;the south&quot; (i.e. North America).  Her thesis is essentially Romantic in a philosophic sense . . . subsistence living was/is hard but authentic.  The coming of modernity, with its internet connection, TV, store-bought goods, etc., has removed both the means and the incentive for a life of integrity.

Barker explores the inner dimensions of World War I -- its effects on soldiers and those who care for them, both physically, psychologically and emotionally, in all senses of the word &quot;care.&quot;  In these times (fall 2001) when the US is heading towards who-knows-what kinds of upheavals, this sensitive portrait of what was supposed to be &quot;the war to end all wars&quot; is an important addition to our understanding.	2001-09-27
US	51967157	R2DOBO2XARP5SF	0452272726	296956896	The Eye in the Door	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	If you only read one war book -- make it 3 -- this trilogy!	This is #2 of the Pat Barker trilogy about World War I, and this second book is as important as anything you're going to read about war in this challenging season (fall '01). She looks at the inner workings of fear, prejudice and scapegoating -- in the case of WWI Britain, homosexuals and pacificists.  Scapegoating is alive and well in America right now, as we look for someone to blame, or someone on whom to take out our tensions.  All too often it looks like the &quot;someone&quot; is a fellow American with whom we disagree.  Read this book, for a deeper understanding of the stresses and strains of war -- on soldiers, yes, but also on us all.	2001-09-27

I highly recommend this book to any woman -- particularly any mid-life woman -- who is exploring what it means to be a spiritual creature, and any man who looks at the women in his life and wonders what might be going on for them.	2001-09-25
US	51967157	R1ISMDZ061YAPM	0486400484	988877464	The Aran Islands	Books	4	27	30	N	N	The times are a-changing . . .	. . . on Aran as everywhere else.  I have had the privilege of spending two weeks on Inish Mor, one 4 years ago and one in the summer of 2001.  The difference between the two visits was enormous . . . where on the first visit I saw perhaps 5-6 cars a day on the little roads, now there are minibuses beetling along everywhere.  The pony carts are strictly for the tourists.  I missed the women setting up kiosks on the road, selling their beautifully made sweaters.  At the same time, throughout the summer, the young people put on a nightly concert featuring traditional Irish music and dance -- and it is fantastic!  So wonderful to see the beauty of the old traditions taking hold in the hearts of the young men and women.<br />BUT ... what is quaint to the tourist translates into abject poverty for the native.  Reading Synge gives one a sense of what WAS, and how hard it has been (and still is) for families to make a go of it on Aran.<br />Read it with respect, and remember . . . all things are changing.	2001-09-25

A reality that those of us who are white too often choose to ignore, and those who are African American may well choose to forget.  Well written, this book makes clear the horrors and the complexities (and the joys also) of African American experience in America. I was particularly chilled by the description of a slave auction to which the white middle class folks came for entertainment . . . and then the sheer inhumanity and brutality &quot;bothered them and so they looked away.&quot;  How true, even today!  READ THIS BOOK . . . you won't be able to put it down.	2001-09-10

The subject matter is clearly fascinating . . . an insider's description of the turbulent history of China over the past 150 years . . . And yet ultimately the book disappoints.  The writing is stilted and often turgid . . .where was the editor?  The high drama of China reads like an old-fashioned text book, and reminds me why I used to &quot;hate history&quot; in school.  A good editor or secondary writer could have made this a blockbuster.  I'm sorry.  It didn't work for me.	2001-09-06

I have been to Glendalough twice, spending a week there each time, with many hours in the company of the authors of this book.  Michael Rodgers and Marcus Losack know and love the area of Glendalough.  They are deeply grounded in the spiritual heritage of Celtic Christianity and, in addition, honor the deeper and wider aspects of spirituality that are present in this ancient site.  In an era when Glendalough is in danger of becoming just another spot on the tourist trail, Michael and Marcus' book helps you to go deeper into ancient traditions, whether your pilgrimage is in person or in your heart.	2001-08-16

This is part of an ongoing conversation, and should be read in dialogue with the (in my mind) better book, The Battle for Christmas by Nissenbaum.  However, Restad's book is an excellent one for anyone who seeks to understand the &quot;whys&quot; of the cultural traditions that bombard us.  As well as get some handle on the &quot;hows&quot; of doing things differently in your own life.	2001-06-05

This book bored both my husband and myself . . . and we're eclectic readers, hard to turn off once we've committed to a book.  Levine's earlier work is good, but IMHO by now success has gone to his head.  Take a &quot;Marriage Enrichment&quot; course or something, but don't waste your $ on this book.	2001-06-05

On the whole, though, this is a good de-mystifier for those who are a bit afraid of tofu. The &quot;cheesecake&quot;, &quot;Mayonnaise&quot;, &quot;hollandaise sauce,&quot; and &quot;eggless egg salad&quot; are staples in my home.  Well worth adding to any cook's library.	2001-06-05

And then, life happens.  Sometimes the traditional liturgies are just what we need.  And other times, whether through physical or psychological distance or spiritual alienation, there we are.  Alone.  With limited resources.  Here's where having York's book at hand can make all the difference.  She writes from both practical experience and compassionate wisdom -- I believe this book is important both for those of us who will someday be grieving (as who among us will not) and those of us who have unresolved issues of grief in our hearts.  Don't miss this one!	2001-04-25

I've read widely in books on this topic, and I'd have to say this one is more superficial than some others that are equally available.  Not a time-waster, but you come away with &quot;helpful hints&quot; rather than the realistic nurturing and empowering you need in order to be able to act in a time of grieving.	2001-04-25

Sarah York brings intelligence, wit and astute observation to the complex subject of human transformation.  No stranger to suffering herself, York's accessible text quickly builds your trust level to the point where you are able to see how her insights and illustrations touch points of meaning in your life.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is contemplating or in the midst of change . . . or everyone who wants to go deeper in their quest for meaning.	2001-04-25

This is more a &quot;social history&quot; of a particular part of WWII than a book about &quot;the war&quot; per se.  As one who was born in 1944, I came away deeply enlighted and even more deeply moved.  This is history  as we need to read it . . . so that history may not repeat itself.	2000-06-11

Scholars should give this book an A+ for breadth of coverage and depth of analysis . . . but as a lay person in the field of academe, I celebrate its honesty and passion. While the chapters are uneven, each portrays a working  writer who, for one reason or another, claims her Appalachian heritage as  foundational in her life. By connecting with the rootedness of these  widely-varying women, my own life --and spirit-- are immensely enriched.  This book adds a unique perspective to the &quot;spirituality of  place&quot; genre that includes such popular writers as Kathleen Norris and  Thomas Berry.  Take a chance -- read it! If it touches you as it did me, it  may change your life.	1999-05-04
