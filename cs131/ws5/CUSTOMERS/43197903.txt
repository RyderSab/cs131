In this book MacDonell started with how he became a Canadian soldier and then described how he was sent to the Pacific War zone during the World War II. When the Canadian army lost the battery in Hong Kong, he became the prisoner of War. He depicted how the Japanese in the Prison of War camp in Hong Kong, then Japan treated him and other soldiers. After years in the prison, he was eventually released in the year of 1945. He then described how he struggled through and became a successful businessman. It is an excellent memoir. The only minor &quot;mistake&quot; is the inconsistent of the names of the place. For instance, the Hong Kong Tai Tam Reservoir sometimes is romanized as &quot;Ty Tam Reservoir.&quot; Other than that, the book is well written and organized.	2003-03-31

He then found out that his mother had secretly arranged to be buried alone, instead of in the share plots that his father had purchased years ago. Winbery then felt that, as Ruth's first-born son, he has the obligation to explore the family history to reconstruct his mother's life and to seek the answer of his mother's fateful decision. This book is about Winberg's family history and memoir. He finished this book with the help of his daughter, May-Lee Chai. I read some book reviews before I picked up this book at the library. I disagreed that this book is full of &quot;fictionalized events.&quot; I think this book provides very good discussion about family history and its roots. It is an enjoyable reading.

However, this book provides much in-depth information about the old Chinese customs-especially the role of Chinese women at the turn of the century. This book is filled with conflicts of traditional Chinese values vs. Western values. I admire Chang Yuyi's courage to tell her own story to her great-niece, Pang-Mei who took the time to write the story. Hsu Chi-Mo (Yu-i's ex-husband) was one of my famous writers since I was at junior high school. I read all poems, collected works, letters, essays, and diaries, etc. I was so fond of his romance with Luk Siu-Man. I learned that he had a \\"trouble marriage,\\" however, it is the first time I am able to read about the other side of his life through his ex-wife, Chang Yu-i. Through this book Yu-I unveiled the \\"dark-side\\" of a famous scholar to the whole world. It is a great book. I enjoyed it very much.	2003-03-23

This book started when Anh Vu was a twenty-year old medical school student in Saigon in 1975. The situation of Vietnam became worse and worse. She found that her life at the medical school became very uneasy. Her classmates disappeared or left the country one by one. So, I thought it is another book, which depicts how the Vietnamese escaped from Vietnam when Saigon was fallen to Viet Con in 1975. However, I read further, I discover that it is not only a war-time memoir, it is also about how Anh Vu and her family discovered of, and relationships with God. Vu's grandfather is an opium addict who finds his way to redemption with the help of missionaries. The family believes that they won't be able to escape from Saigon without the help of God. It is definitely a good book. I enjoy it.	2003-03-23

In this book, Catherine tells her true story. As a transracial adoptee, Catherine has spent eight years to search her \\"true\\" families, including her \\" mother and father, sisters and half-sisters. It is a wonderful book. A review says that \\"Catherine takes us through the tortured labyrinth of American racial and ethnic divides and miraculously makes us glad we took the trip.\\" I disagree. I don't think it is a book about American diversity issues in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is just a book about Catherine's search of her \\"true\\" family history. I admire her persistence to search and her courage to tell the world about her experience. However I feel extremely sorry for the McKinsleys, Catherine's adopted parents and brother (William). They love her by heart, but it is so hard for them to show their love to her. Catherine refuses to accept their love. I think it is not easy to be an adopted parents, especially Catherine's adopted parents. She refuses to accept them. When I read the chapters about the confrontations and conflicts between Catherine and her adopted mother, I almost cry out and tell her, \\"Stop it! Why aren't you be nice to your mother? Why are you so hard on her? What do you want from her? It is OK for you to look for your birth mother, but you don't have to be so hard on your adopted mother.\\" It is so unfair to her adopted parents. Catherine is now a renowned writer. I hope that she feels thankful to her adopted parents. It is them who gave her a very wonderful life and chance to be an educated person.	2002-12-09

She began training in the arts of dance and etiquette since then. In this book she tells her life story. She described her upbrining life at the Iwasaki okiya. I enjoy reading this book because there is no geishas in the history of Japan has the courage to come forward in public to tell her story! However I feel angry with her parents because they allowed her to be a geisha when she was only five years old. She was too young to make such decision on her own. In order to be adopted by Iwasaki okiya, she went to the court at the age of 10 and 12 to declare that she was no longer the daughter of Tanaka, her own parents. She also terminated her junior high education just because she needed to concentrate on her professional career. I feel terribly sorry for her when I read those incidents in her life. I agreed with her sister, Yaeko that her parents somewhat sold her to Iwasaki okiya for money. This book not only unveils Mineko's life but also help explain what it is really like to be a geisha. It is a wonderful book about the geisha culture.	2002-11-02

Having been arrested for small crime and be held at the jail, Sam Davis determined to go to college to make changes for his life. He encouraged his two best friends, Rameck Hunt and George Jenkins to do the same thing. They studied together and worked together and of course, partied together.

This book depicted his life story, including his school and university life in Hong Kong, moved to China and worked under the National government in China during the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong, his university life in Oxford, etc. I like this book for a few personal reasons: (1) when Yu worked for the National government during the World War II, he served at the Seven War Zone. It was the same area and same years that my father served for the Natinal Government. I heard the name of the places and people since I was a girl. I shared the information in the book with my 89-year old father. (2) Yu obtained his primary college education at University of Hong Kong, me too. I was graduated from HKU in 1989. (3) Yu's old home at Shelly Street at Central District in Hong Kong is very close to my old home at Caine Road.

Therefore, Carol was broken down for years when one of her sister, Shari died in a car accident in 1976. It took her years to &quot;back on track&quot; her own life, and then another sister Danielle died of cancer in 1993. In this book, Carol honestly depicted her relationships with family and her life. I like this book because it somewhat relates to my own life--I also have brothers and sisters died young too. I can understand how much pain she bore when her siblings died so young. It is a book that leaves the readers a heavy heart.	2002-06-24

She was totally blocked out the outside world for two years. I felt so sorry for her. However I admire her courage--her courage to set up an undergroud school for girls and boys at her home.

I like this book because it depicts the real life of a gangster leader and shows how he gets away from the authorities and how he runs his \\"business.\\" The book unfolds like an action movie. For instance, in one scene Kon is attempting to smuggle a large amount of heroin around his waist at the airport. When he is about to be body-searched, he drops his expensive Minolta. The camera smashes on the ground, distracting all the security guards. They apologized as Kon walks away with the drugs. It is pure drama.

He failed the BAR examination eight times but eventually received his law degree at the age of 54. Unfortunately he died in his early 60s. As a second generation Italian-American, Merullo was raised with parental expectations, but made his own way.

This book offers a general history of libraries, from ancient cultures up through the origins of American public libraries. I found this book is very informative and I think the editors did a very good job on compiling the photos and illustrations. I like this book. However I found there is a mistake on Page 40. On this page there is an illustration about papermaking in Far East in the ancient time. The caption indicates that it is an illustration of early Chinese papermaking. Unfortunatle it is completely wrong. The characters/languages in the illustration are NOT wriiten in Chinese, but in Japanese. Also the clothing of the man in the illustration apparently is not in Chinese style--he is wearing a men's style kimono. I am not very disappointed when I notice the mistake. I believe that one incorrect illustration won't degrade the value of the book. And, I really enjoy this book. It is not only a &quot;coffee-table&quot; book, but also a very good reference book!	2002-04-16

I am so grateful that Will provides possible survival skills for the people who work at libraries. Especially there is no library schools in this world will have regular classes to teach the future librarians how to deal with difficult/problem library patrons or library workers. I hope that library schools will consider to put this book on the required reading lists for their students. I encourage anyone who works at the libraries should read this book.

I like his written style and the way he approaches the topics. Unsolicited Advice is a book of questions that are asked from the people who work at the library, including library pages, library clerk, professional librarians, and even library directors. The most impressive thing of this book is that Will Manley creates &quot;humorous&quot; titles to the answeres. For instance, when he &quot;advises&quot; new librarians not to compare the ways the previous library they worked, he makes up the title as &quot;When Husband are dead they look better,&quot; and when he mentions that it is not a good idea for husband and wife work at the same library or the same department, he says, &quot;People go to work 40 hours a week in order to get away from their spouses.&quot; These kinds of titles are &quot;honest&quot; and most important, they are humor and makes you laugh from the bottom of your heart. In addition the illustrations are great too. they will make your laugh and think and even feel the real meanings of Will Manley's answers. It is a great book for anyone who work at library. Hey!

After I read this book, I feel very sorry for the author, Jennifer Lauck. I am sorry for her uneasy childhood and the experience she had when she grown up. For me, it is an \\"American modern version\\" of Cinderalla's story. Unfortunately it is not just a story, it is a true life story. I also admire Jennifer's courage--the courage to make her life to public. I just wonder if her adopted family read this book what will they think and feel about it? Will they feel shame or guilty to put a young girl in such a terrible situation? Or they feel it is a \\"makeup\\" storybook? Or they simply denied as they did when Jennifer asked them why they mistreated her when she first came to live with them. I guess they probably just keep silent. There is one thing I do want to point out about this book. As a reader, I would like to have this book be published with Jennifer's first book, Blackbird rather than it is published as a separated publication, even though the book might be turned out a very \\"thick\\" book.

However, I noticed that there is a subtitle under the title, &quot;An American Woman's Life inside Japanese Prison Camps in the Philippines during WWII&quot; then I realized that it is NOT what I thought. This is a truth story about a young woman, Evelyn Whitfield who spent three years in a prison camp during the Japanese occupation. In the book she portrayed the life in a civilian prison camp (of course it was different from military prison camp). In the camp, prisoners suffered from starvation, lack of medical treatment, mulnutrition, etc. However, I didn't find any in depth torture or physical abused by the Japanese soldiers. That was the good thing in that camp. But I was surprised. This book is not as &quot;horrible&quot; as other wartime stories/memoirs.

However, there were still a few &quot;lucky one&quot; be able to escape from these old customs. Of course, it wasn't easy.

However, she was too young to see the emotional layers underneath the cheerful surface. Only had she entered the convent, she realized the conflicts between a normal life and a community life. Most important was that she had to  &quot;give up&quot; her family, including her father, her mother, her brothers, and her sisters. She was only allowed to see her family on special occasions. After 12 years struggling and trying very hard to fit in the community life in the convent, she gave up and decided back to the &quot;world.&quot; In this book, Mary Wong described the strictness and restrictness life in the noviate. What I like most is that she shows her respect and love to all the nuns she learned and lived with. Even though she left, she still believes that &quot;best things are more than bad things in the life of convent.&quot; This is a book that reminds my own experience in Catholic school in the mid-1970s.

This was a novel that I loved. The story was about a Japanese woman, Hana who came to the United States to married a man she had never met before. The story was happened from 1918 to 1943. The author, Uchda san, successfully combined the story with a very strong history background. He allowed the readers be able to &quot;learn&quot; the real life of Japanese-American particularly before and during the WWII. At the same time, he unveiled the &quot;conflicts&quot; between the second generations and with their immigrated parents in the United States. However, there is one thing I would like to point out. In the book, the author sometimes utilized the Japanese romanization style instead the English translation. For instance, he used &quot;Oji san&quot; instead of &quot;uncle.&quot; If the reader has no knowledge of Japanese, I am afraid that they will lose their interests as the story was continuing.	2001-07-15

I couldn't down the book once I started reading.... Mr. Hall provides a very rich history of the Chinatown in New York City during the mid-1800s period. He is succeeded to &quot;enable the reader to smell history.&quot; In the book, Mr. Hall describes his father &quot;denied&quot; his identity of Chinese which shows the typical dilemma of the new generation of Chinese immigrants in the United States. However, I was &quot;confused&quot; by the subtitle, &quot;a family memoir of chinatwon&quot;. I expect that the book mainly describes the author's family history, rather than concerns on the hisotry of Chinatown history.	2001-07-10
