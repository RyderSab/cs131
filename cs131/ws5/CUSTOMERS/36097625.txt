The garrison was overrun and killed by troops under command of Nathan Bedford Forrest, one of the founders of the first KKK. Add the fact that many of the dead were black and the politically correct liberal left school of history is in full cry. The worst book on the subject is Richard L. Fuchs &#34;An Unerring Fire: The massacre at Fort Pillow&#34;. The only thing missing in that book is Forrest in formal Klan robes riding about extorting his lynch mob of an army to kill all blacks.<br /><br />Mr. Ward avoids these mistakes and produces what is the most evenhanded book we are likely to see. The Union Army in west Tennessee was a series of second or third-rate units with sever leadership problems. Black marketing, speculation in cotton, a hostile population and a habit of &#34;foraging&#34; contributed to the poor condition of these units. Into this mix came two distinct sets of regiments raised in the area; the United Stated Colored Troops comprised of freed slaves and the white &#34;loyalist&#34;, many of whom had deserted from the Confederate Army. Being in the USCT or a Tennessee Union regiment didn't change racial attitudes, dividing local commands even more. The isolated forts were to be abandoned but the profit in cotton was to attractive for Memphis to act quickly.<br /><br />Into this mix rode General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his very able command. Forrest had made Memphis his home before the war and many of his men were from the area. The book covers this 1864 raid in detail giving us a good understanding of the conditions Forrest's men face and the stories of &#34;foraging&#34; they had heard. Fort Pillow was targeted, invested, refused to surrender, overrun and a massacre occurred. Forrest lost control of his men but was never charged with any crime. It was impossible to build a case against the man that would hold up even in a Reconstruction Court.<br /><br />Having said all of this, why don't I like the book? &#34;Damned with faint praise&#34;; sums up the author's treatment of Forrest. In any question on where he was or what he was doing, the glass is always half empty. He should have been stopping the massacre not checking the gunboats on the river. However, these boats could have slaughtered his command if they had fought. &#34;The Wizard&#34; is used so often, in referring to Forrest, that it becomes a snide remark. Likewise, his Christian name was not &#34;Nathan Bedford Forrest, slave trader&#34;.<br /><br />The stories from the saviors of the massacre are told in stunning detail, as is the fate of the Union POWs, both white and black. This section of the book clearly illustrates how the &#34;hard hand of war&#34; was being applied. This is not a pleasant book to read but it is the best coverage of the subject I've found.<br />Having said all of this, why don't I like the book? &#34;Damned with faint praise&#34;; sums up the author's treatment of Forrest.

The author produces an agenda ridden work of little or no value except to those already convinced of Forrest's guilt. As an historical account, the book is unable to carry the overwhelming weight of his agenda and collapse. Forrest is the major bogeyman of the politically correct liberal left school of history. This work establishes Mr. Fuchs firmly in this group.<br /><br />Purchasing this book will help you understand Fort Pillow to the same extent that listening to speakers at an anti-war rally will help you understand American foreign policy. The second option is free.	2005-10-13

My reasons are simple; he is an excellent writer and makes a good case for each of his points.  Rafuse takes the time to tell the reader what he hopes to accomplish and attains his objectives.  Along the way, I am informed and each point is supported with references.  His books on the 61-62 war years highlight the growing realization that this is not going to be a short glorious adventure.  In bringing this point home, he keeps the reader within the attitudes of the time and increases our understanding of the events as they happened.  \\"A Single Grand Victory\\" was part of the mythology of the Civil War and weighed heavily on the generals of both sides.  The title is both their hope and fear.  This caused some actions that seem stupid but are logical within this context.<br /><br />In this short but well written book, we get a good campaign overview with an operational battle study.  Well balanced we understand the problems both commanders face and how close the battle came to being a Union victory.  The myth of taking Washington, pursuit of a defeated army is well cover with very logical reasons why they did/could not happen.  My only objection is that the book lacks enough maps to keep the reader fully informed.  This is a common problem, many publishers seem to think military history books do not needs maps.	2005-08-04

Maybe not the best general or the easiest one to deal with, he stands head and shoulders above many of his peers.  This is an excellent military biography of General Price during the Civil War and while over uses is a \\"warts and all\\" story.  The author pulls no punches in saying where Price was wrong and where he was ill served by superiors and peers.  Very even handed, it is clear that price had many admirable qualities coupled with some quirks but he did care and he did try his best.<br /><br />A second plus of this book is the excellent introduction to the war in the West.  Price was at almost all the important battles and each is covered.  The overview of his 1864 Missouri Campaign and almost unique, most histories do not mention it.  Price usually disappears after Corinth but here we follow him to the Trans-Mississippi and defeat.<br /><br />Castel's appraisal of Price is very fair and worth the price of the book.  Couple with the battle histories this is an excellent buy.  The maps are sufficient for the book and tend to be at the campaign level.  However, I did not find that to be a problem when reading about any of the battles.  The writing is crisp, to the point and moves.  Overall, this excellent book will increase your knowledge of the war in the West and needs to be in your Civil War library.	2005-08-04

Knowing the outline and resolution, meets the needs of the majority.  An interest in naval history may lead some deeper into the role of Confederate raiders built in English shipyards.  Most have accepted the story that the victory at Antietam and the Emancipation Proclamation killed any chance of intervention in the war.  Others argue that their never was a chance for intervention and American paranoia was responsible for the whole crisis.<br /><br />Howard Jones lays out a very logical and complete history of British Intervention, American reaction and Confederate expectation.  Systematically, he walks us through the economic, political and humanitarian reasons for intervention.  Not from America's point of view but from the English and French government's viewpoint, following with a quick course in why they thought that the North could never conquer the South.  With this foundation, the reader is ready to understand what \\"Neutrality\\" was for all both sides and why the problems were unavoidable.<br /><br />The one overlooked part of the puzzle is sympathy for the Confederacy and Anti-Americanism in 19th Century England.  While not a driving force, it existed and is considered as it influence the course of events.  The loss of cotton, the plight of the mill workers and the needs of the mill owners play across the pages too.  In addition, the CSA'a heavy-handed tactics in trying to blackmail England with cotton get good coverage.  Each piece is given the right consideration and explanation to keep the story moving while giving you the information needed to understand the process.<br /><br />Most of the story is in London with side trips to Paris, Washington and Richmond.  The book is peopled with a large number of people, most of whom I did not know about.  A short cast of characters with a bio, would have been helpful.  Other than that, I have no complaints about this book.  The subject is one I knew almost nothing about and is vital to the course of the war.  This is war by diplomacy, both nicely spoken and bare knuckles brawling.  Overall, it is a fascinating story of how close intervention came to being and how it was prevented from happening.knew almost nothing about and is vital to the course of the war.

This ignored subject is usually covered in a few pages at the end of a Gettysburg history.  We all know the AoNV managed to get back to Virginia, that it was a horrible experience and that the AOP was unable to force a battle that it could win.  Kent Masterson Brown has taken these few facts, coupled with extensive research and built a story of escape, pursuit and human suffering with few equals in American history.  Somehow, a complex series of stories come together in a compelling narrative that engages and then astounds the reader.<br /><br />This story starts with the failure of Pickett's Charge and ends about two weeks later, with the AoNV safe in Virginia and Meade forever dammed for \\"allowing Lee\\" to escape.  In between is hell.  Rain, mud and floods on a scale that rival the more famous \\"Mud March\\", coupled with thousands of sick and wounded men being transported to safety or death.  Tens of thousands of animals create an incredible amount of filth and draw every fly for miles.  This book allows us to \\"see\\" what this meant in very personal human way that adds to our understanding.<br /><br />Interspersed are battles with the Union Cavalry, worn out, badly beat up from Gettysburg but still \\"game\\" and spoiling for a fight.  Meade must determine Lee's intentions, mount an effective counter and supply his army while caring for thousands of wounded.  The author details these problems and allows us to understand what this means.  For the AOP, pursuit was almost as bad as retreat was for the AoNV.  Short of everything, burden with the dead and wounded from Gettysburg and working blind, they group their way south not really ready to close in for a kill but hopeful.  In the end, Lee has time to entrench, the Union Corps commanders advise Meade not to attack and Lee crosses the Potomac ending our story.<br /><br />Of note is the treatment of blacks, both slave and free, in the Army of Northern Virginia.  This topic generates controversy but is present in a straightforward factual manner that adds importance to the book.  Much of the personal in the AoNV's supply trains were black and most units had a number of slaves with them.  Kent Brown tells the story of these men, during the retreat without sensationalism.  He makes no effort to minimize the essential services they provide to the army and their masters either.  Their story is woven into the very fabric of the retreat and together produces a compelling honest book.n Virginia.

This is a great alternate history of the Civil War that has captured the characters \\"warts and all\\".  In place of images, we have flesh and blood people trying to win and willing to pay the price of victory.  It is not possible to consider this as a stand-alone book but as the finial story in the epic summer of 1863.  \\"Gettysburg\\" is the alternate history that planted the Army of Northern Virginia firmly in Pennsylvania.  \\"Grant Comes East\\", is the logical continuation as the CSA tries to capitalize on its' greatest victory.  Battles are an integral part of both books but political considerations consume much of our attention.  Double-dealing, backstabbing, jockeying for advantage and the secret agendas of Stanton and Sickles cause Lincoln problems, just as Davis is second guessing Lee, every step of the way.<br /><br />This book is the end of the war.  Both sides have paid a very high price to keep Lee and Grant in the field.  In spite of setbacks and numerous problems, both men know they must win the war not next year but now.  The South has no more resources and the North has seen to many defeats.  While the authors remind us that Tennessee is an important front, the war is here in the East.<br /><br />Civil War armies were hard to destroy.  No one battle was going to keep the men from rallying at some point.  In the first of the modern total wars, armies not cities are the objective.  This grinding down process is captured in an entertaining and informative story.  That pulls you in and ties you to it.  While the outcome is not in question, the path to it is.  The \\"path\\" is the story of grinding unrelenting combat.  Taken from the history of the 1864 Overland Campaign, the authors give us a very real feel for both the men in the ranks and the generals in charge.  We come to understand in very graphic terms what is required to destroy the other army.<br /><br />One again, the more you know about the Civil War the more fun the book is.  Quotes, things that happened, should have happened or that we wish had happened are worked into the story.  Do the authors play with us?  YES and it is great fun!<br /><br />This is an excellent series and this maybe the best book.  I started hating the idea of the series and ended one of the biggest fans.

While they do not require a great deal from you, you can have a good time with them.  George Walsh's Civil War books are \\"beer n pretzel\\" books, easy to read, informative and great fun.  They are an excellent introduction to a subject.  While providing the more experienced reader a good review relaxation and enjoyment.  My expectations are that I will enjoy myself without having to think overly much.  \\"Whip the Rebellion\\" meets my expectations while surprising me a couple of times.  First and foremost, this is a fun read while being informative.<br /><br />The book provides a good overview of Grant's rise to command without burdening the reader with all of the complex side issues.  The book gives us a glimpse of the early relationship between Grant & Halleck, with enough details to help us understand it.  Did Grant drink?  This book has a simple but very good and complete coverage of the subject.  The complexities of Mead's command problems are not given adequate coverage but are mentioned in passing, as they did not change the main story line.  The book lacks maps but this is to common lately.  Faulting Walsh for not writing a complex history is like faulting Pfanz for not writing \\"beer n pretzel\\" history.

Officers have to learn how to fight their command too.  Missing these classes makes all the drill worhless and a defeate possible.  US Grant understood this and Belmont is his first training class for himself and his army.  This small battle is either overlooked, ignored or used as an example of Grant being beaten on the field.  All of those ideas are the wrong approach to understanding this battle.  Was it important to the war?  Not really.  Was it important for giving semi-trained troops a taste of combat and instilling in them the habit of victory?  Yesand this was Grant's objective.  When he had accomplished his objective, he pulled back.  Did everything go well?  No, some officers didn't control their men, some men went off on tangents, orders were missed and a series of small problems made for a harder day than planned.<br /><br />All of the above makes for a good story and Nathaniel Hughes Jr. tells it well.  After laying a good foundation, he takes us through each phase of the battle telling us what is going well and what isn't.  Move and counter move occupy the book as Polk & Pillow, move to first stop and then try to destroy the Union invader.<br /><br />A series of good well placed maps allow us to follow the action.  A series of illustrations place faces to the names.  Coupled with good clear writting make this an enjoyable and informative reading experience.

Very few of us have talked to a Union soldier or even someone who had talked to one.  With each year, the number of greats increases before grandpa as these men slip away.  Photography was a toddler during the war and the stiff formal posed pictures taken do not help either.  The carefully posed \\"candid shots\\" look almost as formal as their portraits and that blur, in the back, is someone who moved.  We cannot see them marching past in movies, smoking and laughing as we can soldiers of the World Wars.  No matter how many books we read, war games we play or movies we see, these men stay stiff and formal frozen in time.  This removes the human aspect from the war, costing us a real understanding of the feelings it invoked.  A cannon ball flying through the ranks was much more than a subtraction from regimental strength or an increase in casualties.  Real men, fathers, husbands, sons died or were maimed.  They had hopes, dreams, suffered lonely days, laughed and sang.  This book is a step toward recapturing 21 of the Union dead, restoring flesh and blood to that formal picture, while telling the story of the war in very personal terms.<br /><br /> Mr. Crawford has struck a balance between history and humanity in this book.  The format is simple and elegant; each chapter is one Union Soldier's story told in a simple way that helps us understand him.  In some cases, the story contains information from his letters in others the last letter is the focus.  Six officers and 15 enlisted men, important to their families but not to the overall history of the war, populate this book.  They die in big battles, skirmishes, as POWs, from illness and possible foul play.  Some anticipate their death and those letters show how brave a man can be.  Expecting to die, these men went forward determined to do their duty no matter what their fears.  Others are struck down unawares.  They write home saying they are fine but within weeks are dead from illness or an unexpected bullet.<br /><br />Reading this book has brought home how little armies at war change over the years.  From the American Civil War to Viet Nam to now, lonely soldiers far from home determined to do their duty write letters home.  This book drives home that point not by preaching but by showing us the man behind the picture.fine but within weeks are dead from illness or an unexpected bullet. <br /> <br />Reading this book has brought home how little armies at war change over the years.

This small book was able to instruct and entertain me at the same time.  No small feat considering how much time was spent waiting and how little time fighting.  Why Richmond, as short of resources as it was, spent so many resources on a navy escapes me.<br /><br />They did and this book is the story of that effort.  John Coski maintains the right level of technology, ship building, problem solving, research and tedium through out the book.  This gives the reader both a real feel for and appreciation of what happened.  Peopled with a large number of unfamiliar names, introductions were quick but I could recall them easily.<br /><br />The Richmond Navy Yards are the heart of the story.  Peopled with a large variety of workers, many Black, they struggle to construct the heart of the squadron.  Shortages, problems and the draft are constant problems speeding and slowing construction.<br /><br />For the men at Drewry's & Chaffin's Bluff, Richmond is luxury.  Much of the time in tents sometimes with little food in bad weather, they wait for the Union Navy.  The men on the ships consider the men at the batteries to be living in luxury.  Trapped in ironclads that are ovens or iceboxes, secure behind a wall of torpedoes and sunken obstacles, they wear down the ships and themselves patrolling.  At last, the James River Squadron came out to fight in January 1865.  The operation is well-documented and great fun to read.<br /><br />This is a Savas Beatie book and they continue to do an outstanding job.  The book is full of period illustrations, pictures and the excellent maps we expect from this house.  In addition to the naval maps, a general campaign map for 1862 & 1865 insure we understand the overall situation.	2005-05-17

McClellan is not an easy task.  Few Civil War books have anything good to say about him, fewer still defend his actions in the field.  His victory at Antietam is often listed as a draw or even a Confederate victory.  This \\"victory\\" is because McClellan should have destroyed the Army of Northern Virginia and their survival is a \\"victory\\" for them.  His problems with military intelligence and the chronic over estimation of numbers is a \\"character defect\\" that he used to keep from fighting the army he created and loved to much to use.  When pressed, even his harshest critics, will admit that McClellan created the Army of the Potomac and that it was the premier Union army during the war.  Finally, they will acknowledge that McClellan always obeyed orders from Washington, even when he disagreed with them and felt they hurt his army.<br /><br />This book covers McClellan's background and actions up to being removed from command for the last time in 1861.  While not taking a position, each incident is completely covered and footnoted.  This allows the reader to both check the author and to draw well founded conclusions from the text.  For this reason, \\"McClellan's War\\" should become an important milestone in the evolving debate about his service.  The amount of information packed into this book is staggering.  While the book is so well written that, it reads like a good novel.  The combination produces a very enjoyable and dynamic learning experience.<br /><br />Everything is here.  All the questions about relations with Congress, Lincoln and Scott, are examined and both sides presented.  Coverage of the question about reinforcements during the Peninsula Campaign is complete with attention to the critical sequence of events.  McClellan's feelings about and support of Pope are fair and well documented as are his difficulties with Stanton.  The Antietam Campaign is a major item in the book and very well covered.  What McClellan did and did not do, how it influenced R.E. Lee's plans, and the subsequent events is very well done.  The condition of McClellan's army, the problems he faced and the effect they have on the battle of Antietam is a revelation.<br /><br />The author takes the time to explain the theory of Conciliation and the political exchanges between its' supporters and the Abolitionist.  The lucid discussion of the development of both these ideas and the background of the people that supported them is an important contribution to ACW this book makes.  After reading this, I gained a much better understanding of the early war and how the policies developed as the war progressed.<br /><br />Over all stands Lincoln, literally towering over McClellan.  The book details the pressure Lincoln is under and the changes in his attitude towards, the South, McClellan and the war in the first 18 months of the war.  In addition, we come to understand how the two men, wanting the same victory, were unable to bridge the widening gulf between them.  McClellan, with his background and beliefs, was unable to understand or respond to Lincoln's problems.  Lincoln, forced to respond to pressure and discarding the policy of Conciliation, could not give McClellan the time and resources he needed.  The strength of the book is we understand both sides and have sympathy for both men.<br /><br />In the emerging debate on McClellan, Ethan S. refuse has written his name along side Joseph L.

The book details the pressure Lincoln is under and the changes in his attitude towards, the South, McClellan and the war in the first 18 months of the war.  In addition, we come to understand how the two men, wanting the same victory, were unable to bridge the widening gulf between them.  McClellan, with his background and beliefs, was unable to understand or respond to Lincoln's problems.  Lincoln, forced to respond to pressure and discarding the policy of Conciliation, could not give McClellan the time and resources he needed.  The strength of the book is we understand both sides and have sympathy for both men. <br />In the emerging debate on McClellan, Ethan S. refuse has written his name along side Joseph L. Harsh as authors of \\"must read\\" books on the subject.	2005-05-07

For the enthusiast, a battlefield can be one of the best places on earth as you see more than words can convey; gain understanding of the what, why and how of the action.  You can connect with the men; hear the guns while seeing their view of the battle.  Talk to someone who has walked Pickett's Charge, climbed Missionary Ridge or stood looking toward The Sunken Road and you will feel their connection to that event.  Each National Military Park is unique and the experience of one is not the same as another.  Shiloh, in majestic isolation, is the park closest to what the veterans wanted to tell us about their service.  This book is the story not of the battle but of saving the battlefield and determining how that story would be told.<br /><br />In December 1894 Congress passed an act to \\"establish a national military park at the battlefield of Shiloh\\", with a budget of $75,000.  This was in response to pressure from veterans who wanted their battle commemorated.  From 1862 to 1894, only a military cemetery was in the area.  Except for the cemetery, the battlefield had returned to farmland.  Whenever a body was found, the cemetery would come out to remove the remains for burial.<br /><br />This book, details how a small group of men converted several thousand acres of land, thousands of personal accounts and the Official Records into the park we have today.  It is great fun to read about this effort and the writing is crisp and easy to follow.  The author tells a good story, keeping our attention while generating interest.  The amount of detail this small book is amazing as we work through land purchases, mapping the battlefield, placing units amid the chaos of battle while trying to find a place to live and work.  It took a strong person to do this and we were blessed with a series of them, each making a unique and necessary contribution to the park.<br /><br />Monumentation produced a new set of problems as regiments fought the official interpretation preferring their memories.  Shiloh went through a series of \\"battles\\" with veteran's groups, state lobbies and the War Department that lasted for years.  Lastly, the author gives us a glimpse of the emerging question on the Hornet's Nest complete with historical background.<br /><br />While this is a small book, it is well worth the money.  I have gained a real understanding of what was required to build the National Military Parks and will carry that with me each time I visit one.ion to the park. <br /> <br />Monumentation produced a new set of problems as regiments fought the official interpretation preferring their memories.

This is a clear, concise, comprehensive account of the Island War in the Pacific.  Clearly written, Leckie puts his reader into the picture while teaching, producing a potent combination of entertainment and learning.  You can get hooked on history reading Leckie; I did as a teenager.<br /><br />Robert Leckie lived many of these actions and his personal experiences makes the narration more real as the reader senses his feelings and experiences.

The battle is overshadowed by Appomattox Court House a few days later and largely forgotten. Visitors to Appomattox will be hard pressed to find information on Sailor's Creek although the Rangers can give you directions to the battlefield. This very desperate, full-fledged battle destroyed two corps of the AoNV leaving Lee little offensive capability and less supplies. The time lost trying to save them contributed to his army being trapped at Appomattox.<br /><br />Mr. Smith has written a very readable, intelligent account of the events leading up to the battle. His coverage of the battle is clear, allowing us to follow event easily with a minimum of confusion. The impact of the battle on the campaign and the men involved is well covered. The aftermath for the Confederates taken prisoner is very interesting. Overall, this is a very readable battle history but it could be improved.<br /><br />My two objections are;<br /><br />1) Maps. Publishers need to understand that battle histories need them. This book has far to few maps and far to many Illustrations. This is not problem unique to this book, publishing houses need to reconsider the lack of maps in battle histories.<br /><br />2) Bias. Both sides were very brave, tired and hungry. Members of the AoNV had it worse than the men in the AOP but courage and dedication were not unique to either side. Mr. Smith overly emphasizes the out numbered scarecrows in butternut facing the blue clad hordes. Some of it is true but to often detracts from the story.<br /><br />Overall, I like the book and feel it is a good value. It could be better but it is a good book and you will gain an understanding of this battle including the questions about the name.	2005-04-03

Four in the first months and four during the course of the war.  All of us know some of the names, students of the war know more but few can name all eight men.  They were diverse but in many ways similar, all West Point educated, all intelligent and well to do by the standards of the times.  One never led an army in battle, one was killed in battle, two fought with President Davis almost constantly and one almost destroyed his army.  Overall, most of them were not very good generals being unable to work within the system to produce victory on the battlefield.<br /><br />Each man is the subject of a 30 to 40-page essay covering his life, outlining his pre and post war activities but concentrating on the war.  Each essay is written by a different person, which both adds and subtracts from the book.  Taking a positive approach to J.E. Johnston or Braxton Bragg is a challenge but taking a very negative approach detracts from the book.  Depending on your view, the essay on AS & JE Johnston, Bragg and Hood will be enjoyed or disliked.  I found the JE Johnston essay to be very negative and overlooked many of his contributions.  Bragg got a fair and even handed critique, while Hood is cast as a tragic figure.  Beauregard's essay was excellent and I enjoyed Cooper's essay the most.<br /><br />The book is badly needed and while not a \\"must have\\" is a valuable introduction, I would have liked it much better if it had been less partisan.	2005-02-18

Mixing in a good deal of greed, a chance to capture large amounts of cotton, called white gold, can move along just about anything along.  The Red River Campaign of 1864 qualifies for one of the best examples of this.  The idea was to deal the CSA in the Trans-Mississippi a deathblow and drive them from northern Louisiana.  40,000 Union soldiers and 60 ships are to converge of the CSA forces at Shreveport.  Lack of cooperation between the army and navy, poor communications and worse leadership resulted in a resounding defeat for the Union.  The book shows that a resolute leader can succeed over odds, even if his superiors are not helpful.<br /><br />This is a well-written book with maps in the right places.  The author expects the reader to know nothing about the campaign and keeps us fully in the picture.  This is an excellent campaign history and a good addition to your library.	2005-02-02

Our Civil War history is limited to the VMI Cadets at New Market and the invasion of 1864 by Early.  We now have a book that fills in the gaps telling us the why, where and how.  Reading this book explains why a hard-pressed Lee would detach Jubal Early to The Valley on more than a desperate gamble.  All of this sets up the reasoning behind Sheridan's return to The Valley and his actions.<br /><br />This is a very well written book presenting the 1864 campaign in Western Virginia in a logical sequence allowing the reader to follow the events with few problems.  How events in one place influence another area is well detailed giving the reader a clear picture of the overall campaign.  The author manages to place events within the 1864 Overland Campaign without detracting from the story.  This is one of the strong points of the book, giving us a full and clear understand of the war.  The only problem is maps.  There are not enough of them and the ones we have are poor and badly placed.	2005-02-02

It happens off to the East if you are reading about the Trans-Mississippi.  It happens off the West when you are reading a book on Shiloh.  When you read about Forts Henry & Donelson, they clear the way for it to happen and it had to happen to allow the Vicksburg Campaign.  If you read about the 1862 campaigns in Virginia, Island No. 10 makes Pope into McClellan's chief rival.  Setting up all the questions about Second Manassas and did or did not the AOP with hold troops allowing Pope to be defeated.  In 1862, Island No. 10 is one event that seems to be included in every story but is not important enough to be a story.  We all know about it but we lack knowledge of the campaign falling into the always their but never central to the story.<br /><br />With no large battles or star players, it is easy to see how this happened.  Pope's reputation is destroyed in six months and Foote dies within a year canceling the Union leaders.  The Confederacy never commits a major player to the defense of the island.  After surrendering, reputations destroyed; captured and imprisoned the commanders are relegated to minor positions when exchanged.<br /><br />This small book covers the actions of both sides as they struggle for control of a critical position on the Mississippi River.  Island No. 10 is the tenth island south of the Ohio River and a key defensive position in stopping the northern advance from Cairo.  Generals Polk, AS Johnston and Beauregard all had other things on their mind and the island was never a primary position.  We are given an excellent but concise understand of the \\"bigger issues\\" caused this to happen.  When Union General Pope took New Madrid, he cut the position off from most river traffic.  Flag Officer Andrew Foote with ironclads and mortar ships launched a prolonged bombardment.  Each side builds and abandons positions on the river, conducts raids and endures the boredom of siege operations.  The reader gets a good understand of the move counter move of constant action.  The book's maps keep the positions clear, while photos and illustrations give us the feel of history unfolding.  The infighting between the armies and navies is a piece of ACW history seldom seen.  The Confederate commander would not risk his ships wanting to save his ships for use in defending New Orleans.  The Union commander was convinced his ironclads were all that stopped Confederate control of the Mississippi.  The Confederate ships fled as Pope tightens control below the island and Foote faced with increasing pressure and near mutiny allowed a couple of ironclads to run past the defenses.<br /><br />The Union City series ironclads, weak by later standards, were the decisive weapon in 1862.  We see that here, as they are able to defeat anything the CSA can throw at them.  Reading this book, helps us to understand the CSA's withdrawal to Corinth and the thinking behind the attack at Shiloh.<br /><br />Larry J.

As both sides struggle to lean how make war, Western Virginia succeeded from the Confederate States of America.  This is the story of the first campaign of the Civil War, the foundation of George B. McClellan's reputation.  Facing a divided Confederate command structure, aided by William Rosecrans and operating in friendly territory Mac had all the trumps.  Robert E. Lee, unable to grasp the idea that any Virginian would not follow the state's lead was slow to react.  When he finally was forced to take command, it was to late and his reputation suffers for it.

The specific event is quickly lost as the series of events come to life and the result occurs.  The result is the important event that makes history.  We may find mention of the minor event in a good history.  If you wish to learn more, you will find few detailed studies.<br />The Battle of Ball's Bluff is a very minor event in the American Civil War.  In terms of a \\"battle\\", about 3,500 are involved on both sides, hardly qualifying as major skirmish in four years.  Depending on who is speaking, the \\"battle\\" is a slight demonstration, a reconnaissance in force or an attempt to occupy Leesburg.  Whatever it was, it became a disaster for the Union force.  They lost over half of the men involved, as once again a Union force fled the field of battle.  Confederate losses were about ten percent of the Union's and they captured about 500 prisoners.  Defeat at Ball's Bluff following defeats at Manassas and Wilson's Creek deepen the gloom in America.  To make things worse, Senator Edward Dickinson Baker, a close friend of President Lincoln, is killed leading a regiment.<br />This poorly planned unintended battle suffers from a lack specific objectives.  Everyone tries to evade responsibility in the aftermath.  McClellan has evidence that the army is not ready to enter the field.  Lincoln starts to question his officer's abilities as he mourns Baker.  The congressional Radical Republicans are certain the West Point officers lack zeal.  The Confederate's view of Yankee shopkeepers deepens as their moral climbs.  The Union solider in the East suffers a second bad defeat in three months.  The battle of Ball's Bluff brings the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War into being.  What had been private mussing, discussions over dinner or dissatisfaction flares into a witch-hunt that bedevils the administration and the army for the length of the war.<br />What is the Battle of Ball's Bluff?  What was the overall plan, if one existed?  What happened on the field?  This book answers our questions by providing an in-depth look at this operation.  The author answers, to the extent possible, the questions that have existed for 150 years.  The eight chapters cover the lack of planning, objectives, information and fighting in detail.  With so few units and such a tight space, the action is easy to follow.  The author writes in a direct descriptive prose that is clear, informative and very readable.  Maps and illustrations are in the right places and easy to follow.  An Epilogue follows the participants through life making them more than names that exist for a few hours.  Seven Appendixes cover Order of Battle, provide in-depth answers to some questions, a look at the Memorials and the battlefield.

Beatie is writing what should become the classic series on The Army of the Potomac.  This is the second volume in the series dealing with the time from the defeat at Bull Run to the preparations for the Peninsula Campaign, September 1861 to February 1862.  Readers of Civil War history will find few books on this six-month period and for good reason.  This is NOT a battle book.  This is NOT a campaign history.  This is a history of preparation, problems, misconceptions and politics.<br /><br />Central to the story is George B. McClellan, fresh from victories in Western Virginia and given command of a defeated army.  He determines not allow the army to be pushed into another battle.  The priority is training, organization and more training.  McClellan's severest critics admit that he excelled in this job and built a very professional army from the raw volunteers.  His struggle to do this is the heart of this story.<br /><br />To enjoy this book, you must rethink the American Civil War returning to a time before the total war when many still felt that peace without victory was possible.  The newspaper's lists of the dead and limbless men on city streets are not yet common.  The war is still a great adventure to many.  Acceptance of the theory that the history of North America could depend on one great battle that would establish the Confederacy or save the Union is common.  Many Newspapers preach this idea, Politicians endorse it and Generals accept it.  Preparation for this battle is McClellan's goal and he works at it with a single-minded purpose day and night.<br /><br />The book deals with the small upsets, the friendly fire incidents, poor leadership, failed logistics and miscommunications that kept McClellan from achieving his goal.  While he feels unready, the public is demand action and expenses are mounting.  The major military battle is Ball's Bluff; the major battles are the removal of General Scott and the establishment of the Joint Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War, the first a victory and the other a defeat for McClellan.  How events and personalities interact and react is the heart of this book.  McClellan, Lincoln, the Radicals, the War Democrats, the press, political generals, West Point graduates all march across the pages making demands on each other and seeking advantage.<br /><br />The discussion on the selection of general officers; the interaction between the states and the Federal Government is worth the price of the book.  It is something that you seldom see in a history but builds a real understanding in the serious student.  How the War Democrats expect the war to be fought and their feelings toward the South get full treatment too.  Not the standard quick dismissal but an intelligent walkthrough with \\"logical\\" reasons that supported their ideas, most of these reasons will be disproved in the coming months but for now they are \\"logical\\".  The reaction of the Radical Republicans meshes with the expectations of the people, feed by the press, to produce an overheated atmosphere of doubt.  McClellan's personality causes him to make a series of bad choices that creates an opposition movement.  Unable to build a real relationship with the Republicans he is isolated, surrounded by enemies in a trap of his own making.<br /><br />In December 1861, McClellan is ill for three weeks.  In the history of the war, this is a small event but a major one on the road to his dismissal.  A helpless McClellan showed Lincoln how little he knew and how dependent fighting the war was on one person.  This was not a good experience for Lincoln, who moved to correct the problem.<br /><br />This is not a fun read nor do we have sympathy for many for the principles and several are despicable.

Detractors say this book is to correct errors in first one but supporters say that this book introduces and expands on the subject.  In either case, this small book, under 300 pages, contains a wealth of ideas and information on the idea that James Longstreet lost the Battle of Gettysburg.  The accusation that he destroyed Lee's perfect plan of attack is part of American History and still hotly debated in Civil War groups.<br /><br />Mr. Tucker details the Lee & Longstreet Gettysburg controversy from the battle to the 1960s.  In addition, the relationship of two men from Gettysburg to Lee's death is covered in detail. Unlike many authors, he supports each of his points with statements from participants giving an authority to this book lacking in many works on the subject.  The book quickly covers each of the participant's roles at Gettysburg and within the controversy giving us an understanding of why in addition to what.  In some cases, the action or lack of action at Gettysburg had more to do with their position than anything else did.  When accusations were made, who made them, who supported them is the heart of this book and often critical to understanding the truth.<br /><br />This controversy filled the balance of Longstreet's life as he defended himself against charges that he destroyed the Confederacy.  Many times, Longstreet's failing health or memory caused problems when trying to defend himself.  This has muddied the truth and in some cases supported the charges against him.  Mr. Tucker works to clear up all the questions and provides valid and supported answers to each accusation.  This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the Battle of Gettysburg and the relationship of Lee and Longstreet.	2004-10-24

This is not Ed Bearss three volume 1,800+ page detailed history of the Vicksburg Campaign and no one should mistake it for a substitute to that work.  It is not a one-volume history of the campaign either, being to small for that.  My first statement was this is an impressive book but then I told you what it is not.  You might now ask what is this book and why should I part with my money to own it?<br /><br />You are buying ten articles on the Vicksburg Campaign, an introduction, Epilogue, endnotes and index contained in 220 pages.  Interspersed are maps and photographs of the participants.  Even with the reasonable price, this will not sound impressive to many people.  The physical characteristic of the book hide some very interesting and sometimes startling articles dealing with a person or aspect of the Vicksburg Campaign.  Together, they form a very coherent picture of the campaign that is both captivating and informative.<br /><br />Highly recommended is \\"Playing Smash with the Railroads\\", \\"Spades are Trump\\" and \\"First Honor at Vicksburg\\".  The first covers the Grierson Raid from La Grange to Baton Rouge.  This is the story of fast movement and misdirection as Grierson moving south cuts the railroads and upsets Pemberton.  An excellent map complements the article, making it easy to follow the path of the raiders and their pursuers.  \\"Spades are Trump\\" provides a look at siege operations and the progress Grant's army was making toward reduction of the defensive works.  Scheduled was a major assault for July 6.  The closeness of siege lines to the defensive works, the several mines in place, forced Vicksburg to surrendered rather than be stormed.  The story of the 1st Battalion, 13th U.S. Infantry both explains the desperate initial attacks, the decision for a siege and ties the Civil War to the present day.  This unit attacked the Stockade Redan on May 19 and today wears \\"First at Vicksburg\\" with pride.<br /><br />The city and the citizens have full coverage with a quick history of the city and life was like under siege.  Both are well done and convey the carnage and disruption of war.  Unlike many books, the surrender and events leading up to it are covered.  Grant finds himself forced to give more \\"generous terms\\" by the realities of transport capacity and not wanting to deal with thousands of half starved POWs.<br /><br />This is a strong book that does not require the second volume, however, the two volumes provide a more complete history of the campaign and siege.

Sears continues to hold his position as one of the most readable of ACW authors.  Able to inform and entertain at the same time, Sears catches the reader and never lets go.  Some will question the need for \\"another\\" book on Gettysburg.  Others will point out that this could be considered a rewrite of Coddington's work.  I have not tired of Gettysburg books nor of Sears' work.<br /><br />This is an excellent book.  Those that say nothing can be done with Gettysburg need to read this, Sears proves them wrong.  He bring a very fresh and intellgent view to the Lee/Longstreet confrontation of the Second.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about Gettysburg and want a new book on the campaign, this is the one!	2004-10-09
US	36097625	R1PV54RASOVOD1	1574883534	922423661	Glory Enough for All : Sheridan's Second Raid and the Battle of Trevilian Station	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	Just Excellent!	Mr. Wittenberg is the author of several books on cavalry operations in the Eastern Theater, all well documented, informative and very readable.  This book is my personal favorite.  He hits the \\"sweet spot\\", balancing a solid battlefield history with personal experiences of the participants.  The history set up an experience, which amplifies and explains the history bridging the story to the next incident.  The result is an informative history of Sheridan's cavalry raid in June 1864 with an in the saddle feel rarely found in nonfiction books.<br /><br />The heart of the book is the battles of Trevilian Station on June 11 & 12, 1864 and Samaria Church on June 24, 1862.  Trevilian Station is Sheridan's attempt to cut the vital Virginia Central Railroad and Samaria Church is Hampton's attempt to capture Sheridan's wagon train.  The two battles do not stand-alone but exist in Sheridan's cavalry raid, with the raid firmly placed in Grant's Overland Campaign.  This means that the reader never forgets the total operation and the war.  Very often, battle histories do not include or spend very little time on the larger issues causing us to miss this vital information.<br /><br />This raid contains a who's who of Eastern cavalry personalities: Philip Sheridan, Wade Hampton, Fitzhugh Lee and George Custer are well known, Thomas Rosser, Matthew Butler, Alfred Torbert, Wesley Merritt and David Gregg much less so.  Each man has an interesting word portrait with a detailed account of his role.  Mr. Wittenberg draws some interesting conclusions about the battle and the men.  As always, his conclusions are well supported and thought provoking, making for a book that is both an introduction with something for the more knowledgeable too.	2004-09-26

The Civil War buffs had a great time with the book and found it to be well worth the money.  The politically motivated cannot get past hating the author and never gave the book a chance.  If you want to hate the author, this series is not for you.  If you are looking for a history of the Gettysburg Campaign, the book by Sears or Coddington is recommended.<br /><br />I am a Civil war history buff and like many of this type something of a Gettysburg nut.  When the book came out, I refused to even look at it and said very nasty things about it on the [...]  Many of the alternate history Gettysburg books are nothing more than junk written for the \\"Lost Cause\\" crowd.  These books have nothing to do with history and less to do with entertainment.<br /><br />One afternoon in Borders, with nothing else to look at, I pick this up ready to hate it.  In about two pages, I was hooked!  The more you know about the Civil War the more fun the book is.  However, if you know nothing about the war, this is still a great read and may start you on a life long interest.  The book is so good and the historical descriptions so accurate that some buffs worry that people will not understand this is fiction,<br /><br />\\"Gettysburg\\" is a very logical, very well written alternate history.  The things that change the course of the \\"real battle\\" are all possible.  The change in R.E. Lee that makes most of the story possible did occur about a year later.  Yes, the CSA has a run of good luck but a good history of the battle of Antietam will show you that is possible.<br /><br />This is the first book in the best alternate history series on the market.  My advice, buy \\"Grant Comes East\\" at the same time and save on S&H.	2004-09-26

I feel this is a very important book and one that a serious student of the war should read.  Additionally, I feel that this book should be read after Connelly and Horn to preserve a balanced picture.  Woodworth presents a more favorable view of Bragg than I have seen from other authors.  Some of this is fair and some maybe the author's perceptions of Bragg.  It takes getting used to and the more you know about Bragg and his failings the better off you are.  He scores many good points and made me modify my view of Bragg and the problems he had with Polk and Hardee.<br /><br />His treatment of Jefferson Davis is very fair.  His points are valid and well supported, showing where Davis did well and where he did poorly.  The reasons for the decisions are supported and logical, given Davis' personality.  This is the best part of the book and balances the blame the \\"Eastern Block\\" that is found in other books.<br /><br />I am less happy with his treatment of Longstreet, feeling that he has accepted the \\"Lost Cause Myth\\" and not explored the situation.  Rather than dismiss Longstreet, I would have liked to see an explanation of his relationship with Davis and Lee's influence in this area.<br /><br />This is a well written, easy to read informative book.  Not without faults but a valuable addition to my ACW library.	2004-09-10

Sumter.  Mr. Detzer treats us to a very readable beginning of the American Civil War and the city that started it.  1861 Charleston is well drawn, very understandable and engaging as a city on the brink of war.  Major Robert Anderson determined to do his duty with little guidance from above and constant criticism from below, takes center stage.  Washington, distant and unsure is as much of a problem for him as the Rebel guns in the harbor.  Presenting the position of the Confederate Government and the \\"fire eaters\\" in Charleston as they see events helps the reader understand the decisions made.  While not agreeing or disagreeing, the author informs and guides the reader through this complex time.	2004-08-23

Daniel is an event in the ACW community.  He has an established reputation for scholarship and readability that some authors can only envy.  A book on the Union Army of the Cumberland by him is a milestone.  No real history of this army is in print.  Except for some battle histories, the majority by Peter Cozens, the AOC might not exist in print.  This book is a good start to correct a deficiency in ACW history.<br /><br />First, this is a readable book populated with very well drawn characters.  Second, the battles and campaigns occur within the life of the army.  All to often, an army seems to spring from battle to battle without an idea of how or why.  We understand how the campaigns come about and why the battles occur where they do.  Most of all, we come to understand the relationships between the generals.  Thomas' reasons for refusing to replace Buell and the effect it had on him is an interesting and on going story.  How this action and Rosecrans' habits echo through the army's history is one of the best subplots in the book.  This is not the reason for the book but these two men have a major impact on this army.<br /><br />Objections, the maps could be better and more of them would have helped.  The post Chattanooga history seems rushed; another 100 pages would have made this a better book.  I would have liked to follow Thomas and the major elements of the AOC back to Nashville and seen them face Hood.  These are \\"nits\\" and do not detract from this excellent book.	2004-08-23

Neither the author nor the publisher wanted this type of \\"New\\" edition.<br /><br />Eric Wittenberg felt the original was \\"a bit muddled in places\\" and wished to fix this.<br />The discovery of official reports to and from Custer on the fighting in the East Cavalry Field created an opportunity to include additional vital materials.<br /><br />In 2005, Lost Triumph: Lee's Real Plan at Gettysburg and Why It Failed has Stuart and Pickett making a coordinated attack on July 3.<br />Principally those who cannot believe Lee ordered unsupported attacks accept this idea.  The new edition takes a detailed look at this idea in a twenty-page appendix.<br /><br />Lastly, the landscape at Gettysburg has changed since 2002; the new Visitor's Center is an important one.<br />Equally important is the personal GPS, which is now a common item.  These changes caused a rewrite of the driving tour.<br /><br />All of the above went into this edition.

The Union Cavalry had many handicaps at the start of the American Civil War and that was only one of them.  Trapped by official disapproval and high command's indifference the cavalry had real problems.  This is the story of the journey from ugly stepchild to equal on the field of battle.  At the start of the war, official Union policy refused to raise volunteer cavalry regiments.  The existing Regular U.S. Army Cavalry would be able to perform all the duties required and the government had no need to incur the additional expenses.  Late to the field, badly trained and saddled with a tactical doctrine that guaranteed failure the cavalry endured and learned.  In 1863, the Cavalry fought the Cavaliers of the Army of Northern Virginia to a stand still at Brandy Station.  This is the story of the two years of abuse and misused that plagued them.  Even more, it is the story of the AOP's Cavalry growing and developing their role in the winning of the war.  This is first of a series of excellent book on the Union Cavalry by Eric J. Wittenberg.  This book builds a solid foundation that will help the reader understand the real price of victory in 1865.	2004-08-15

Many times the reader's prior knowledge of the battle becomes critical to the enjoyment of the book.  Noah Andre Trudeau once apologized for writing another book on Gettysburg.  His point was with so many Gettysburg books on the market reading a book on Gettysburg is like visiting a childhood friend.  Only a few words are necessary to recall shared experiences from a long acquaintance.  Other battles are strangers we may have heard about but lack knowledge of.  This lack of shared experiences and the common ground of an old friend can make an introduction awkward and difficult.  Becoming \\"lost\\" on the battlefield is a common problem as the action moves past but leaves us clueless to the importance or location of the event.  The \\"little picture\\" takes full control leaving the reader with only the vaguest idea of how we arrived on the field, why we are fighting the battle or where we will go afterwards.  The less prior knowledge you have of the battle, the more likely you are to encounter problem understanding the battle.  This book will often end up on eBay or sitting in the bookcase with a scrap of paper marking where you gave up.  We all have bought this book and each time we wonder, \\"What is it that makes a good battle history?\\"  What do we need when being introduced to a battle to make a pleasant and informative beginning?  What will keep our interest and make us want to finish reading the book?  \\"Champion Hill Decisive Battle for Vicksburg\\" by Timothy B. Smith from Savas Beatie LLC is a battle book that can answer these questions.<br /><br />Civil War buffs are familiar with Grant's Vicksburg Campaign; some of us can even name most of the battles.  We know that the battle of Champion Hill located between Jackson and Vicksburg is the critical battle of the campaign.  Grant's defeat of Pemberton caused the latter be trapped in Vicksburg and forced to surrender on July 4, 1863.  Good start, now how much do we really know about this battle?  Champion Hill, as most western battles, suffers from a lack of available books making a new book something of an event.  Sam Elliott, the actor and Civil War author, has characterized Tim Smith as \\"a fine young Civil War scholar\\".  This book shows why he can say that.  The writing is sure, swift moving and compelling.  The opening chapter outlines the frustration of the Vicksburg Campaign while introducing the main characters.  This gives us an understanding of how few options Grant had and why he chose what many considered the most dangerous one.<br /><br />This is a battle history.  The promise is a battle and a battle is what they deliver!  In the package is a clear concise, descriptive account of the campaign that ends in the siege of Vicksburg.  Not one battle, but Port Gibson, Raymond, Jackson, Champion Hill and Big Black occur during the nineteen days of May between crossing the Mississippi River and arriving at Vicksburg.  Thirty-eight maps ensure we don't get lost or have to go searching for a map.  The map you need is always on the page or only a couple of pages away.  I never had to bookmark a map or try to figure where the action is with a map that did not fit.  Theodore P. Savas did the maps.  As the editor, he makes sure the maps are informative, timely, detailed and easy to read.  Photographs of the people involved, while never required add a nice touch.  They help the reader see the characters as flesh and blood people, giving them a face in a way that words alone will not do.  The book gives us seventy-eight photographs of the characters and puts them where we encounter this person.  I find this nicer than a section of photographs in the middle of the text.  Something else I like is the 16 page \\"Modern Photographic Gallery\\" of the battlefield with a map showing the location and angle of view of the photographs.  No matter where I was in the book, I always had access to a map, pictures of the participants and in the back a view of the terrain.  This made for a very smooth and enjoyable introduction to the battle of Champion Hill.  The chapter on the aftermath details how the loss at Champion Hill drives Pemberton into Vicksburg, the impact on his men and the sever loss of materials is very well done.  Equally informative is how victory lifted the spirits of Grant's men, built confidence in them selves and in their leaders.  This explains the collapse of Pemberton's army and the hasty retreat into the Vicksburg fortifications.  \\"Thereafter\\" gives us a short what happened to of many of the people involved, who survived the war, what they did and where the others died.  Notes, index and Order of Battle complete the book.<br /><br />Of more than passing interest, Tim Smith takes the side of General John A. McClernand, something very few historians do.  More than one Net ACW group has had an extended debate on this.  I expect the subject that will only heat up as more people read the book.  His treatment of McClernand is very evenhanded, reporting when he did well at Port Gibson and badly at Champion Hill.  However, it is clear that Mr. Smith does not share the standard historical view of the man.  This is an interesting development and it remains to be seen where it will go.  Are we seeing the start of another rethinking of ACW history or this is an idea that will go nowhere?  Using the author's support of McClernand to dismiss the book is a very bad idea and those this do will be the poorer for it.<br /><br />What we have is an exceptionally good battle history, complete with maps and photographs.  This may not be the best battle history ever written but it is one that should be in your library and sets a standard that other's should try to reach.r where I was in the book, I always had access to a map, pictures of the participants and in the back a view of the terrain.

The 2nd Vermont Birgade were men who want to to something but were unwilling to enlist for years.  Accepting a bounty they gave nine months to the war, that nine moths ended in July 1863 at Gettysburg.  At the end of their enlistment they stood fast on July 2nd &amp; 3rd beating back the Longstreet's I Corps.<br />Making good use of letter, we follow this group of men through the reality of a Civil War enlistment.  Eight months of picket lines, sickness, death and being away from home with no action.  Quickly changes as we race north after the AoNV into two days of very hard battle.  In reading the book, you see how little life in the army has changed and the impact Gettysburg had on the men for the balance of their lives.<br />Very well written, easy to read and follow.

The maps while not really good, do allow you to follow the action and provide the position information needed. They seem to be the only weak point in the book and this seems common to current ACW history books.<br />The first thing you find is how bad leadership was in 1862!  Only Grant seems to be willing to fight and take chances.  Halleck and Buell worry and find reasons why things can not happen while Grant is doing them.  Of intrest is Halleck's actions against Grant and how he is pulled up short by Lincoln.  This books continues to show Halleck as the fool that he was.  It shows that Lincoln getting him out of the field was one of the best things he did.<br />Pillow seems to be the only fighter the CSA had in the area and his performance has ups and downs.  For the balance, infighting, stupidity and indifference are the nicest things you can say about them.  AS Johnston comes in for the usual blame in this are, all of it well deserved.  He is unable to command and unwilling to take real postive action when attacked.<br />If you have an intrest in the early days of the war and or U.S. Grant this is a &quot;must read&quot; and well worth the money.	2003-12-28

This is the first book from The Valley of the Shadow Project and may become the classic Civil War home front book.  Two counties, one in Pennsylvania one in Virginia were selected and life during the war closely documented.  Very few of the people in this book are even minor players in the war, which is the books greatest strength.  Without &quot;important&quot; figures, the story concentrates on what's in the newspapers, changes in prices and local problems, in other words the normal daily life of the people living in the counties.<br />An excellent introduction tells us about counties and the people free, slave, white, black, rich, middle class or poor.  We learn how they make a living, farmers for the most part, what industry and jobs are open to them.  How they learned of the events beyond the county and how they reacted to them.  We are taken through the election of 1860 and into war.<br />We gain an understanding of a war that isn't generals and battles but separation, death and sadness.  Battles are reported in terms of local men killed, wounded or missing and in letters that are printed in the paper or passed from house to house.  Fear of the enemy army and invasion is very real and happens.  Politics is very important and the divisions in the North contrast with the solidarity in the South.  As Pennsylvania's Democrats and Republicans fight for power and over emancipation.  While in Virginia, the papers report the problems as evidence the North's war effort is failing.<br />This is a book for the serious student of the war and for a person who wants to learn about life in America 140 years ago.  This is one of the most informative books on the Civil War that I've read and recommend it to you.	2003-12-14

The author agrees with all of the revisions with out presenting any of the things that made them impossible at the time.  Did/did not Chamberlain order the charge, probley not, but his actions that day inspired it and he did hold the line.  Longstreet was late, yes, but it had as much to do or more to do with Lee's actions than anything else.  Pickett's Charge was a bad idea and nothing Longstreet could do would change that.  Mlavern Hill and Fredicksburg had already proven this to everyone but Lee.<br />Sears' book is much better and if you want a large format book look at David J. Eicher's &quot;Gettysburg Battlefield&quot;.	2003-08-22

I had never heard of the Battle Of Carthage when I picked this book up the first time.  It looked interesting, had a nice cover design, was a Civil War History and I'm a buff.  What I found was one of the best small battle histories I've ever read!  Well written, multiple maps, where you need them, pictures, notes, OOB this book has it all,including a Battle Field tour.<br />Unless you have no intrest in the Civil War you will like this book.	2003-02-23
