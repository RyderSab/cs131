This book started off well and you really got a feel for this wonderful and special older woman who was a healer and the central character.  As the book progressed it became a struggle to read because of the other characters and their inter-relationships.  It simply never came together for me.<br />I have, however, enjoyed other Kaye Gibbons books.	2000-10-20
