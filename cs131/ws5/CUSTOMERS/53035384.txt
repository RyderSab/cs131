I read \\"Sugar Blues\\" over 15 years ago, and the health community is only now falling in line with what the author had been preaching, decades earlier.<br /><br />This health classic is a MUST read for anyone who wants to get well, or just improve their health.  It is my opinion that it should be required reading, for anyone who goes grocery shopping. It's packed with convincing and interesting facts, examples and anecodtes.  It even touches upon some historical accounts concerning the consumption of sugar, and it's negative impact.<br /><br />Another excellent book is, \\"You Are All Sanpaku\\" by George Oshawa.	2005-05-05

It teaches the basics of the rosary AND beyond; so that even veteran rosary enthusiasts, can benefit greatly from this book.<br /><br />The rosary is a powerful form of prayer and meditation, and this book lays it out with a direct, and easy approach.  Most of all, it includes some fascinating and inspirational anecdotes from John's personal experiences with the rosary.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-28

A REAL PAGE TURNER YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT DOWN	\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" represents the BEST in today's historical fiction, because much of it is based on little known, and fascinating facts.

It could have also been titled \\"The Tragedy and the Triumph\\".<br /><br />It is something of a \\"poor little rich/famous girl\\" book, but written without a real shred of self-pity.  Tatum is too intelligent for that, and she is strong.  You can tell that she has done a lot of work on \\"righting\\" what has been wrong in her life, much of it due to circumstances beyond her control. However she also freely admits her mistakes, sins of commission and ommission.<br /><br />I came away from this book admiring her and learning not to judge others too harshly, 'cause ya just never know what they've been through and what they come from.	2005-01-15

If you liked \\"Running with Scissors\\" you will want to read \\"Dry\\" the sequel to Burroughs' childhood memoir.  Written without a shred of self-pity but lots of insight and humor, this book is both entertaining AND educational. It is not all laughs, however.  There is some real heartache, disappointment and tragedy between the covers.  There is an added bonus in that it taught me quite a bit about the disease called alcoholism, and recovery from it.<br /><br />Burroughs is a wonderful writer.  If you have not read any of his works, you don't know what you're missing!  He's truly excellent, funny, and unique in his style.<br /><br />All in all a wonderful read.	2004-10-07

Although it is a well written and researched historical novel, I kept asking myself \\"WHAT is WRONG with this author!?\\". It seems she has a perverse delight in all the ugliness she describes in utter detail (without a shred of redemption or hope). It is unnecessarily macabre to the extreme and describes utter and complete ugliness, depravity, perversion, cruelty, and despair WITH ENTHUSIASM AND RELISH.  ALL ugliness, ALL the time.  It's unrealistic.<br /><br />After reading this novel, the most abject horrors described by Charles Dickens, would seem like paradise in comparison. Holman REALLY \\"gets into\\" the grotesque and disgusting. Sick Sick Sick.	2004-09-29

This book had me mesmerized and I zipped through it in no time, due to the simple fact that I could NOT put it down!  When I was finished, I immediately ran out and bought Augusten Burroughs' \\"Dry\\" (also an excellent read)which is the sequel to \\"Running with Scissors\\". Now, I can't wait to read his latest book, \\"Magical Thinking\\".<br /><br />I like Burroughs' attitude and appreciate his sense of humor, and outstanding writing style.<br /><br />He has relayed a memoir of his childhood that is almost beyond belief.  The most fascinating thing about it, is that he not only survived to tell the tale, but has done so in such a fabulously entertaining way.  All with a sense of humor!  You'll be laughing out loud. Guaranteed. I love this guy!	2004-09-14

I read this book 3 years ago, and I'm  STILL experiencing recall and flashbacks to some of its passages.  For example: I might be doing nothing much in particular, as I set myself down to dinner at a family style restaurant...and WHAP!!!  I will recall a passage from \\"Nickled and Dimed\\" concerning the not very pretty or easy plight of many waitresses and cooks who work at such establishments. And \\"Nickled and Dimed\\" does it all with a sense of humour, to boot!<br /><br />Very thought provoking and enlightening for anyone who wants a better understanding of the working poor and the flaws in our socio-economic system.<br /><br />\\"Nickled and  Dimed\\" should be required reading for every politician and social worker in the United States.	2004-07-17

They work, and the results will speak for themselves.<br />I remember my Mother, Grandmothers and Aunts explaining the same &quot;Rules&quot; to us when we were children.  For example: Most of the girls I knew were told never to accept a date unless the guy asked you out at least 3 days in advance.  Why? Because, being too readily or easily available made you look like you had no self-respect and were desperate.  It was an embarassment. And...the boy who asked you out on such short notice was also suspect.  Why? Because it often was interpreted to mean he couldn't find anyone else, and you were the last resort! Or he felt you were not that much a &quot;hot commodity&quot; and he could afford to wait to the last minute. Not exactly flatteringh, huh?<br />It's interesting that conventional wisdom like this, is now published in book form and turned into a bestseller.  Why? Because, a lot of women have not been taught any of this conventional wisdom. As a result, they have been wearing their hearts on their sleeve. They have made themselves too available, too forthcoming, too desperate. As a result they are getting very, very hurt.<br />&quot;The Rules&quot; are NOT about manipulating men, either.  They are about having self-respect, self-esteem and having an independent life of your own.<br />&quot;The Rules&quot; should be required reading for every female over the age of 13.	2004-06-29

This would have been a better book if the protagonist (the pilot's wife) wasn't so unbelievably stupid.  She and her husband essentially lead separate lives, for years. This is because of his job as a pilot (supposedly).  She just goes with the flow and never stops to think if things should really be THAT separate.  So....She is easily deceived on a consistent basis, and for a long period of time...yet was totally surprised when the truth was revealed after  her husband dies.
