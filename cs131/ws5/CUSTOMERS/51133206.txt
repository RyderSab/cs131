I've read & kept all 16 of her novels. Everytime I finish 1, I'd sigh & think this is her best. Then I'd consume another & say she's outdone herself once again. Before I encountered SIMA, my favorites were Love, Come To Me, Forever My Love, Midnight Angel & Somewhere I'll find you, but this 1 takes the cake. It has the most romantic story & compelling characters ever penned (right up there alongside Lucia Grahame's The Painted Lady). U can't compare Jodie Foster - Richard Gere's corpse & corpse chemistry (in Sommersby) to Hunter & Lara's intense sexual tension. Meet Hunter, the lustiest &  sexiest man alive (oh well in romance fiction anyway) that'll make U swoon (have your smelling salts handy). In my biased opinion, he's the most exceptional, unforgettable, adorable, fascinating, passionate, gentle, loving, charming, dashing, wondrous, sensual hero ever created (did I leave anything out ? =P). Lara, a burned heroine with a heart of gold!, was reduced to a mixed state of confusion, misery & sexual daze whenever Hunter was in the vicinity. She's understandably frigid after the painful beddings she endured from her insensitive husband in the past. She resented the fact that just when she had her independence, here comes her long-lost husband to wreak havoc on her life. Lara desperately wanted to believe that Hunter's really a changed man -as he claimed to be- who'd never hurt her again (in & out of bed) & not a chameleon. Hunter was hopelessly entranced by his wife & tried his damnedest to convince her that somehow a second chance was being given to them to rediscover love & trust. Like Lara, I also fell in love with Hunter more with every page I devoured (done 'bout 101 times already), for his unwavering determination to break down her barricade & ice-melting ways to weaken her senses. Hats off to Lara too for not giving in too easily. She panicked at the thought of fulfilling her bargain to make love to her hu!sband after midnight. She put her desperate plan to divert Hunter's amorous attentions into gear by inviting Hunter's former mistress to the ball. Her outrageous scheme backfired & pushed an enraged Hunter over the edge. He finally took matters into his own hands & my oh my... that scalding HOT stairwell scene & the ones that followed were nuthin' short of breathtaking (gulp !) & guaranteed to curl your hair, toes & fingers (yes, really). Ms. Kleypas has really brought her trademark erotic scenes 100 notches higher here. The dramatic chapters at the end were heartsplitting & what a beautiful ending (sniff) !. Words can't do justice to what U'd feel when U finally put this sensational classic down on your bedside table. I never wanted the pages to end then & there. I'd be the happiest woman on earth if Ms. Kleypas'd be so kind as to include Hunter & Lara in 1 of her upcoming books (wistful sigh) !he put her desperate plan to divert Hunter's amorous attentions into gear by inviting Hunter's former mistress to the ball.

I own every single 1 of Ms. Leigh's novel, so believe me when I say that here's an author that makes you buy the book by its cover. Lady Graeye Charwyck &amp; Baron Gilbert Balmaine had  unknowingly entwined their fates together when they abandoned cautions to the wind at a secluded waterfall. He's enraged when he found out that Graeye is Edward's daughter &amp; the sister of Philip Charwyck, who was responsible for his limp (read Warrior Bride). Graeye's disastrous attempt to release her imprisoned father prodded Gilbert to return her to the abbey, despite the undeniable desire pulling upon his barricaded heart. When an unexpected dilemma came up, Gilbert kidnapped her from the abbey but reluctantly agreed to Graeye's terms : she will suffer no unwanted attentions from him as long as he refuses to legitimize their love for each other. Traitors &amp; archenemies wreaked havoc not only in their lives, but also Ranulf &amp; Lizanne (Gilbert's sister)'s. Snappy banters, colorful heroes &amp; heroines, extremely hot love scenes, swift story-telling &amp; a suspenseful climax made up an exquisite medieval romance !!!!!	2001-05-20

This book swept me up &amp; had me in stitches up to the sooo-happy ending !!! Grouchy heroes always tug at my heart, but this one scores even higher 'cuz of his Italian temper &amp; reluctant protectiveness towards the love of his life. Not a lot of novels out there feature a spoiled brat to spice up the story. The 1st encounter where Kate almost - and let me quote - 'endangered Burke's hopes of siring an heir' is hilarious &amp; it gets even better since then on. No matter what the other scathing reviews said, I LUUUV this extremely funny, merry, passionate tale of 2 lovable characters fighting their hopeless attraction. It's well-written, fast-paced, overflowing w/ witty banters, dynamite chemistry, crisp plot &amp; sensual love-scenes. In short, it's a page-turner ! This is only Ms. Cabot's 3rd book that I've read (after Lady of Skye &amp; Improper Proposal) but she's on my must-buy list. It'll charm the wits out of ya !!!	2001-04-16

U'll never look at your significant other the same way again, once U put this book down. Don't know 'bout U, but it's the best silhouette I've ever read. It tackles some heavy issues like adultery, denials, rediscovery of  love &amp; a miracle when U almost gave up on it. 12 years of  seemingly-perfect marriage is suddenly shattered into pieces by Max's  confession that he's leaving Celine, 'cuz he's in love with a much younger,  up-and-coming lawyer from his lawfirm. To make matters worse, he expects to  remain friends with Celine, partly because his family adores her. Max's  mother calls it infatuation, Celine's friend calls it 'middle-age crisis'.  To Max, it's something special that he thinks had been missing from his  contented marriage. Hurting, Celine undergoes some changes, like new hair  color &amp; style, make-up &amp; more provocative dresses. To his dismay,  it creeps up on Max that his estranged wife's never looked more stunningly  desirable in his traitorous eyes. Jealousy began to strike him as he's not  the only 1 who notices his soon-to-be-ex wife. Bitter accusations &amp;  explosive confrontations resulted in a miracle that paved the way for  reanalyzing their feelings for each other. Max is trapped in the eternal  triangle &amp; wrecked by enormous guilt. He's torn, realizing that no  matter what he decides, someone's heart is bound to be sliced. I love the  electricity (in &amp; out of bed) between the separated couple, believable  dialogues &amp; circumstances that keep me spellbound &amp; the adrenaline  rushing thru' my veins. By hook or crook, get this HTF classic. I never  wanted it to end !	2000-03-13

Abby has always adored Cash since she was a grubby kid. The night of her father's death, their relationship took a dramatic turn that left Cash beating himself up for getting her pregnant. He feels like a  craddle-snatcher with the 15-years age gap between 'em. So he made an  honest woman out of Abby &amp; a mutual agreement that they'd reconsider  their marriage after the baby's born. Abby may be a 21-year-old college  gal, but she's one heck of a fighter when it comes to getting what she  wants, and she's always wanted Cash. Their marital bliss starts going awry,  as she's suspected all along, eversince - in the throes of labor pain -  Abby confesses her love. Scared the pants out of him, Cash begins putting  distance between him &amp; Abby (emotionally &amp; physically), even though  he knows that he's hopelessly in love with his young wife. This book is  romantic, heart-twisting at times, written wonderfully with smooth  dialogues, believable characters, great chemistry &amp; a very satisfying  ending.

This book really deserved the Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice award for Best Harlequin Presents 1994-95 that it won. Absolutely quality romance delivered by an author that helps U escape for an hour - or two - from your  nerve-wrecking day-to-day life. Nicolas Santino never forgave Sara, his  wife, for what he believed as an ultimate betrayal of his love. He doesn't  accept that Lia is his daughter. Until one day every mother's nightmare  came true, Lia has been kidnapped. That means he has to save the little  girl's life with every ounce of his intelligence &amp; money. But seeing  Sara again after 3 years of separation has unwittingly opened up his  suppressed desire for her &amp; made him think of starting new. Sara has  grown up from the painfully shy girl that everyone - from Nicolas' adored  father &amp; high-class friends - snubbed into a strong-willed woman who  fights tooth &amp; nail to get what she deserves &amp; not being  brow-beaten anymore by Nicolas &amp; the bullying father-in-law. But of  course, Nicolas, the dark-haired, sexy-as-hell Sicilian millionaire, scored  a few points himself in their battle of wills, with his unflinching  determination to break down Sara's barrier. Provocative is the word - as  mentioned in the back cover teaser - to describe the buzzing sexual tension  throughout the story. The ending could've come out straight from a romantic  classic movie, a reminiscent of the first moment the 2 of 'em met that left  Nicolas lovestruck. If you're a sucker for corny stuff like this, then it's  definitely the one for you.....	2000-02-07

U wouldn't wanna miss this spectacular novel, if U know what's good for you. Ms Goodman's great writing talent is shown to the fullest this time. This book has one of the  best premises &amp; plot-driven stories I've ever read in a historical. 447  pages - and small fonts, mind U - filled with fantastic, sharp banter  between Christian &amp; Jenny consumed my attention 'till 5 AM. Some of the  bone-chilling, disturbing scenes are mercilessly depicted. But, the  sizzling platter of love-scenes &amp; rich secondary characters are  compensation enough. Christian is a bitter, restless war hero &amp;  reluctant heir to the newspaper tycoon. Jenny is the mysterious, striking  beauty whom he saved from nightmarish stay at a mental hospital. Her  presence is the turning point of his wretched life. I love it when  Christian finally came to his senses &amp; admitted that He loved her &amp;  asked her to marry him. What a nice change from the usual  arrogant-know-all-to-the-end heroes. I never thought  photography could be  that interesting 'till I read this masterpiece. Jenny is very smart for her  sex - too smart perhaps, 'cuz that was what landed her in the mental  institution in the 1st place thanks to her evil stepfather &amp; brother -  but vulnerable too. Whenever the 2 of 'em are thrown together, the  sprinkler system is in danger to go off. Simply an all-around terrific  writing from the consistently high-quality novelist that'll churn your gut  &amp; I don't mean puking.....	2000-01-17

Years - and dozens of Christie - later, it still stands high as the most amazing murder web ever-penned. A touch of romance here  &amp; there doesn't hurt either.

The scalding HOT sexual tension virtually burned a hole thru' the pages. The murder web is relentlessly spun with unexpected twists &amp; turns that at times it felt like reading an Agatha Christie - the longer, romantic  version. Unless you're an antecedent of the likes of Poirot &amp; Holmes,  you'll be left awestruck by the stunning ending. I confess that of 7 Chase  novels that I've devoured so far, this one is the most remarkable. No, my  sides didn't hurt quite like when I read her other hysterically funny  efforts. The only humor you'll find here is when the mighty Dowager (from  THE LION'S DAUGHTER) shows up to wreak havoc on those happen to be in the  vicinity. After I read the prequel, I understood more how the dashing, cool  Esmond became the man that He was. He's my 1st golden-haired perfection  that I fell in love with (dark-haired rogues were more attractive before he  came along). I truly wish Ms Chase would be so kind as to write another  book that'll give me a glimpse of Esmond &amp; Leila. How beautiful their  children must be, having a fiery temptress as a mother &amp; an  electrifying knock-out as a father. But then again, I need to get a life =P  ; )	2000-01-07

With only less than half a dozen books, Ms. Sands has proved herself to be a writer of enormous talents.

Definitely not the kinda book U wanna read in public  ( like the airport ), unless you're willing to subject yourself to odd  stares from people. I guarantee you'll be laughing your a** off reading it.  Grumpy Amaury &amp; virginal Emma are sooooo adorable, trying to boss each  other around without much success from beginning to the end.

When I read the title &amp; synopsis, I knew this novel'll be a 1st-rate weeper. But I was positively astonished by how highly-charged it turned out to be. Even the cover says it all, a dark-haired hero wearing a mask &amp;  a glove gazing somberly at the angelic heroine. What a pair ! The 1st half  of the book is amusing &amp; delightful. Infatuated since childhood, Laura  dressed up as a grubby maid to win Alex's shielded heart and - thanks to  her adoring uncles - managed to enrage &amp; charm Alex with her constant  &amp; indiscriminate devotion. The 2nd half is almost too painful to read  (don't get me wrong, I consumed the book in 1 sitting), as Alex was called  to war again &amp; tragedy struck in the hardest way imaginable. The ending  is too wonderful - not the usual 'all is well' - to describe, tears &amp;  laughters included &amp; wrapped up in a 380-page package. I was so  impressed by this incredibly moving keeper that I went on a mission to  collect all of her titles from the Auctions &amp; so far 6 Ranney PBs have  proudly graced my shelf.

So much for thinking that he had a normal sexual  preference before he met the twins ! Charlie is my kinda heroine,  impulsive, inventive, quick-witted, mature, soft-hearted ( when it comes to  people &amp; animals in plight ), prone to disaster, and 1 weakness, a  loathing for confined carriages. Radcliffe, not to be outdone, also had a  scene-stealing performance of his own when he had to save his beloved from  the villain's clutch.

Because Philippa threw a bucket of water on Dienwald &amp; sent him flying toward a goat, who reared back &amp; kicked  him on the thigh. Ms Coulter should be given the lifetime-achievement  entertainer award ! Philippa is tall &amp; gangly, saucy, courageous,  strong-willed &amp; unruly. Against Dienwald, Edmund (his brat) &amp; the  people of his keep, she matched 'em word for word &amp; gradually won their  admiration &amp; hearts (although Dienwald is the most reluctant of all).

At times it felt like I was reading a longer, romantic version of an Agatha Christie mystery. I was riveted from the 1st letter to the astonishing ending. The twist &amp; turns of the dilemma kept me on the edge of my seat &amp; sent my head spinning. Could the culprit be him ? or  her ? or both ? I thought I've met the most mesmerizing heroes &amp;  heroines of the decade in Lord of Scoundrels &amp; The Last Hellion. But  once again, I was dumbstruck by the brilliance of Ms Chase's writing style.  Esmond is a cool, charismatic, gut-churning handsome former villain whose  past unknowingly entwined with Leila's. He's put himself thru' hell &amp;  back in the span of 10 years, only to be rendered helpless the moment he  set his eyes upon the fiery Leila. A match made in heaven !(or is it hell?)  Treat yourself to a Wonder Web of murder, deceit, unrequited love, acted  out by vibrantly alive characters. U'll never know where or with whom U'll  end up in search of the real killer. The atmosphere whenever Esmond &amp;  Leila were in the same vicinity virtually crackled with sexual tension.  Their pent-up passion really paid off in sensuous love-scenes that'll fog  up your reading glasses. Fate &amp; circumstances kept throwing 'em  together to solve the puzzling riddles which of course, punctuated their  longing for each other.

The humor is on the same level as Lord of Scoundrels, but the story is too convoluted to me. The family tree is a bit confusing that I had to re-read some parts a few times. I love Vere &amp; Lydia (but I still think the  hysterically funny  Dain &amp; Jessica are incomparable). I also like the  secondary characters, the dim-witted Bertie, who turned out to be not that  slow as he got himself hitched to a bispectacled girl (1 of Lydia's charity  cases). The other thing that I always love to see is the leading man &amp;  lady from previous novel show up in the sequel &amp; still manage to make  me crack up big time. The part where Vere conversed with Lydia's beloved  dog, Susan keeps me chuckling with glee. The only thing that bugs me a  little bit is that Vere keeps calling his Duchess - Grenville, instead of  Lydia, throughout the story, which doesn't sound that romantic. Lydia  certainly is a perfect match for Vere. She punched him, belittled him,  loved him, and stuck with him through better and worse times. Vere may not  look like a besotted fool on the outside, but he is a helpless romantic at  heart, collecting precious keepsakes (Lydia's hairpin etc). Overall, this  is a very lovely book U won't want to miss in your lifetime. Hmmm.... Now  I'm gonna start on my 4th &amp; 5th Chase novels, Viscount Vagabond &amp;  The devil's delilah, which are sitting dutifully on my bed as I type this  rave review.

It's hard for me to pick which Balogh novel is the best, because she writes such compelling characters in her every book &amp; scintillating but gut-wrenching stories. I must say this one is my favorite 'cuz I'm sooo  crazy for David. Wish every hero in every romance novel could be as  terrific &amp; passionate like him. I don't find Rebecca interesting  enough, she should've chosen David over Julian (one of my favorite names,  by the way =P) if she could just see him clearly as the kind-hearted guy  who's been in love with her since they were growing up together. She's also  too skittish when it comes to lovemaking. Even when she has the baby &amp;  all the wonderful things David has done for her, how could she still have  split feelings when Julian showed up out of the blue ? I guess there  wouldn't be much of a story if all went well early on. I agree with most of  Ms Balogh avid fans out there, no one can write more poignant, touching,  endearingly human heroes &amp; heroines better than her. She knows how to  describe every nuance of feeling the character has to suffer for love. Pls  treat yourself to this magnificent classic &amp; it'll never leave your  keeper-shelf.

Can't remember the last time I broke into constant giggles reading a romance novel. I had such a FANTASTIC time that I re-read it again &amp; again &amp; again... Hard to believe I've never read anything by Chase  before this. Dain is certainly the most self-loathing hero I've ever come  across in quite a while. It's so pitiful he can't believe it even when it  hit him right between his crossed eyes that Jessica is in love &amp; lust  with him. Jessica is by far the brightest, toughest, lustiest heroine ever  penned. Ms Chase is a genius author to be able to write such a witty  love-story &amp; enthralling characters. The part where Jess shot him  calmly as if she's merely handing him a candy is truly a classic. Not a  dull moment I had devouring every page. The awfully painful childhood Dain  had - born with a giant nose &amp; scrawny body - made him a cynical man  who questioned the existence of the Lord above. He learned to protect  himself by laughing at his foes &amp; everything else. He even referred to  his by-blow as 'it' 'cuz the boy is the exact image of himself when he was  8 years old. Intriguing hero &amp; heroine, funny &amp; heated sparring,  toes-warming love-scenes &amp; a lovely ending. No words can do justice to  the exhilaration U'll feel reading this brilliant book. Thank U Ms Chase  for presenting this sparkling jewel to us all !	1999-12-06

An alluring story of unbridled passion, young love, betrayal, a real page-turner &amp; what a turn on ! The huge gap in age reminded me a bit of Jane Feather's characters. So what if Justin is cruel &amp; heartless on  the outside ? He's only embracing his belief that if he can't have Megan,  no one can either. Just my kind of hero, a tortured soul, he put his heart  up on his sleeves &amp; came roaring back when he couldn't have her  anymore. He did what his desperate mind told him to do, the only way to  bind Megan to him is by kidnapping her. A rape is too harsh a description  (Mrs. giggles' review) for Justin's lovemaking to the  reluctant-but-as-much-in-love Megan. I just wish there were more authors as  magnificent as Ms. Robards out there. Plenty of heart-pounding battles of  will &amp; toes-curling sex with an ending that'll leave U sniffling for a  box of kleenex !	1999-12-04

Will I ever be so lucky as to find another lovely romance novel in this lifetime ? WOW ! That's 1 way to put into words everytime I finished re-reading it ( done 'bout 99 times already =P ). How often Fleur's  haunting green eyes gazed down upon him from the walls of his cousin's home  in London ! When Anthony first set his cool gray eyes on Fleur from a  distance in a restaurant, she was full of life &amp; love, with her famous  husband on her side. He saw her again 2 and a half years later. But this  time Fleur is a penniless widow with a frozen heart due to the loss of her  baby &amp; husband. Desperate for money to pay her blackmailer, she  accepted Anthony's marriage offer, thinking that she could fool him into  believing that she married him for love &amp; affection. When he found out  her terrible secret, she had no choice but surrender to his terms : her  freedom &amp; a fortune to live on if she agreed to 5 nights of  unquestioning, unrestrained surrender to what he planned to teach her. I  love the sensuous development of the story when Fleur's heart is melting  layer by layer with each of Anthony's lazy seduction. Every  misunderstanding &amp; quarrell is painfully gut-wrenching &amp; oh what an  ending ! Of course, as the previous reviewers hinted, the love-scenes  literally burn up the pages &amp; left me clamoring for more from this  unknown author. I don't know why she didn't make it to the top of the best  of the best-seller list. U have got to read it to believe my gushing review  !	1999-12-02
US	51133206	RG8EXNWOOCZRA	0821752855	3905367	Love's Charade	Books	5	6	10	N	N	A PERFECT NOVEL 2 CURL UP WITH WHEN IT'S RAINING............	First of all, I'm a die-hard Feather fan. This book really satisfies every criteria that I usually look 4 in a romance classic, fabulous title, small font &amp; margin, and 478 pages ? Just can't ask 4 more ! oh did I mention  Justin is my favorite hero name ? If U wanna read something that has  adventures, actions, lots of love &amp; lust, intelligent plot, marvelous  setting, charming banter between the characters, cheeky heroine &amp;  mature hero, this is the ONE. I love the fact that Ms Feather always  depicts the girl as the one who keeps her man on a merry chase from 1st to  the last page. It makes U wish the story would never end. Huge gap in age  doesn't matter much 2 me, as long as he's head over heels in love with the  opposite sex &amp; still keeps a straight head. Danny is stubborn &amp;  learns &quot;love &amp; obedience don't come hand in hand&quot; in a hard  way. She often gets herself in trouble because of her impulsiveness, then  get a good verbal trashing from her husband, Justin, later on. Even when  she has a baby, she still follows what her heart tells her to do, which  drives Justin absolutely crazy wanting to tie her up &amp; lock the door.  Anyway, treat yourself to a fantastic, sparkling gem of a book &amp; U  won't regret it !	1999-11-29

I accidentally stumbled upon this classic at my nearest libray &amp; never let go of it since then. For those unfortunate avid romance fans who haven't tasted her sensational debut, U can check out the Auctions &amp;  prepare to be impressed with how far the bidders are willing to go. That's  how incredible the author is. Her blistering whew-get-me-a-handkerchief-HOT  writing style is incomparable. I also devour Susan Johnson, Stephanie  Laurens, Thea Devine, Bertrice Small, Iris Johansen etc (who pens their own  high-degree trademark) like popcorn, but Ms Schone simply outshines 'em  all. I don't care what the other reviewers say, I personally think this is  a fantastic, splendid, superb, flawlessly-written romance/erotica. Morrigan  / Elaine is sensitive, prideful, mysterious &amp; raw. Charles is the  perfect husband &amp; lover to bring his sleeping beauty alive with his  mediterranian-blue eyes, charms, lovemaking (the grass, the bed, the  river...oops did I ruin it 4 U ?). The bottom line is, I thank my lucky  stars for finding this treasure. If only I could vote for everyone, I'd put  this title up there as the best book of the millenium =P :)	1999-11-28

I believe this is the only QUICK title I will not have sitting on my keeper-shelf. Whatever happened to the used-to-be witty sparring between the hero &amp; heroine ? I always  giggled &amp; sighed over the intelligent plot &amp; the charming  characters of her previous books -- which were all marvelously-written  thank U very much -- after I read 'em. I also re-read 'em all from time to  time. Sadly this one really missed the mark by 10,000 feet. I found myself  skipping over some pages just to get to the finish line sooner. Next time,  I'll also pre-screen her upcoming novel from the library.....	1999-11-28

From the first minute, Marlie - a lonely psychic - was attracted to him like steel to a magnet. Not a moment too soon, their relationship took a turn from  weariness to can't take eyes-or hands-off each other.

The characters are intensely alive, the plot is uncompromising, and the love scenes are immensely blistering. This is one of those novels U just have to sacrifice your spare time for. Yes, some readers will be disturbed  by the violent scenes, but the author takes U to the heart of the story. I  love Francois &amp; Catherine's heart-rending relationship (more than  Jean-Marc &amp; Juliet's).

I agree with every fan out there who adores this magnificent book. Gillian and Christopher are obviously meant for each other, although Gillian needs to  be more convinced as she thinks that she doesn't deserve Christopher's  love. The humor, the plot, and the characters are just splendidly written.  The only thing that doesn't quite satisfy me is the love scenes. They lack  fireworks. But overall, it deserves as many stars as U can count. =P	1999-07-19
