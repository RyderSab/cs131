Some books, after all, are great for read-once inspiration. Other books simply demand that you get your own copy, because it's earned a spot on your shelf.<br /><br />I've been working with The Thimbleberries Guide for Weekend Quilters for the last couple of weeks, courtesy of the Scottsdale Library, and I'm just finishing up one of the quilt projects. I'm probably going to order my own copy of the book; but the key word is \\"probably\\" (as opposed to \\"definitely, I'm doing it now!\\"). It has some compelling features... though it's not perfect, either.<br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff. The 25 projects in this book are  mostly full size (double and queen-sized) quilts, though there are several smaller quilts (such as the one I chose, a table runner). Most have an accompanying project, such as pillowcases to go with the quilt, or a fabric-trimmed rug.<br /><br />Not all of them are gorgeous, but none of them are lame. The designs are primarily using traditional blocks, such as flying geese, though a few projects also incorporate applique. While the quilts aren't labeled for expected skill, they all seemed pretty straightforward to this still-a-beginner.<br /><br />One thing I *love* about the book -- and which earned it a star all on its own -- is that each project is shown with a color photo and matching quilt diagram, _plus_ another picture showing the same quilt done in different colors. That works wonders, when you're trying to visualize how this quilt will look with the fabrics you already have in your stash.<br /><br />Each project is laid out in sections, to accomodate the premise of the busy weekend quilter who can grab time in small chunks. That's a strengh of the book, but it also contributes to its weakness. (At least for me; it may work exactly the way you prefer.)<br /><br />Every project gives a complete list of fabric you'll need (1/2 yard gold print, 5/8 yard red print, etc.); that's standard. However, most quilt books have you cut all the fabric in one fell swoop, so you can get done with that task and put away the rotary cutter. Instead, this book treats each part of the project (cutting the blocks, making the border, etc.) as a separate project. You cut out the fabric for the blocks, then piece them. THEN you cut out the fabric for the quilt center, and piece that.  Then you cut for the border, etc.<br /><br />If you're really working on the weekend-quilter schedule -- just a little bit at a time -- maybe this works for you. In my case, I found it irritating. I had to leave my entire setup spread up (on the dining room table, as it happens) over the course of most of a week, as I wanted to get this silly little table runner done (in addition to working 60 hours a week). I'd rather have done ALL the cutting, then tackled the piecing. Which, of course, I could certainly have done, if I had realized the non-standard way the book presents the project. Instead, I kept being surprised that I had to cut stuff AGAIN! If you know this ahead of time, it may be less annoying; you'll expect it.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is a very good book. The author is cognizant that you have limited time, and has designed a book full of attractive, do-able quilts that you can be proud of.yard gold print, 5/8 yard red print, etc.); that's standard.

While a lot of his statements are indeed based on the numbers (and I could quibble with a few of them myself), I think his premise and conclusion are clear enough: there are things women can do to move ahead in their career, and many women aren't doing those things. That alone makes this book worth your attention.<br /><br />For example, the author points out that there are some professions that are nearly all male, which women don't seem anxious to enter. Garbage collection, for example. Jobs that involve being outside, dirty, or in danger pay more... and those are held primarily by men. When women DO enter those careers, the professions tend to get safer.<br /><br />I've been a woman in the computer industry for a long time; I've written and spoken on the subject on a few occasions (including doing my own share of debunking statistics). One statistic offered by the author resonated with me: a person who works 45 hours a week earns 44% more than a person working 40 hours a week. I've seen more women drop their pencils at 5:01pm than I've seen men do so, in my industry; I'm convinced that women who put in a few extra hours will have more career opportunities than those who don't.<br /><br />All of which feels like a heck of a tangent from \\"is this a good book? should you fork over your own hard-earned clams to buy it?\\"  But, to the contrary, I think it demonstrates how much this book demands that you RESPOND to it (particularly if you're a women, or work with any women). Even I, who try hard to write dispassionate reviews, feel compelled to give personal anecdotes.<br /><br />If you come to this book with preconceived notions, this book probably won't change them. However, if you're looking for ways to move your own career forward -- or to understand why some women you work with seem to be stalled -- I heartily recommend reading Why Men Earn More.eading Why Men Earn More.	2005-09-20

Unfortunately, it only serves to demonstrate that these books are written by individuals who know the area, and whose text reflects that person's interests. Art/Shop/Eat Los Angeles is okay... but for my next trip, I'll probably choose another guide.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the series, here's the scoop. The emphasis is on art, and on the set of most-famous museums in the area. Each of the \\"big\\" museums (here, that's the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Getty Center, the UCLA Hammer Museum, LACMA, and the Norton Simon Museum) get several pages devoted to them, complete with the open hours and highlights of the collection. The book also lists additional artsy stuff in the area, from the Disney Concert Hall to the Chinese American Museum. Plus, you get a list of interesting shops and restaurants, most of which are close by the highlighted museum. And it all fits in a book small enough to stuff in a pocket.<br /><br />Plus, you aren't laden with a guidebook meant for the people who are interested primarily in Univeral Studios or Disneyland. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'd rather pick a book that caters to my interests.)<br /><br />It's a decent premise, and in the case of the London book it succeeds quite well. This one, however, is... okay. Only okay.<br /><br />On the plus side, some of the \\"alternative\\" museums and recommended spots are delightful, the sort of destinations that you'd expect to learn about from a native. In addition to the Japanese American Museum, it lists a Museum of Neon Art and the Olvera Street marketplace. (Not that I had time to visit any of them, but it got me interested.) The maps of each area are small but they manage to be clear; on the other hand, for a city the size of LA, you'll still need a separate map.<br /><br />The small size of the book makes many of the listings TOO brief, however. My getaway weekend started with a desire to see the Gamble House, which earned all of 3 sentences. I'm not sure I'd have \\"discovered\\" it with that little information. And its listing for the Huntington Library and Gardens certainly didn't do the place justice; we went there because of a friend's recommendation, not because this guide sold us on it.<br /><br />The listings for lodgings is essentially useless. I can't judge its shopping recommendations as I didn't try them. But for restaurants... I'm a bit irritated. In two trips to LA, I managed to eat at three of the recommended restaurants (primarily because of suggestions made by people in the egullet.com forums). When I read the listings afterwards, they're accurate enough; but beforehand, I didn't have a sense of what the place would be like. At least it gave me SOME idea about places to eat.<br /><br />Maybe that's a side effect of the book's enforced brevity. I'm not sure what the problem is; the London book is the same size, but I didn't feel as though the information was as \\"thin.\\"<br /><br />One really dumb omission: no index. If I was sure that I'd seen a listing for the Water Grill, but I didn't know where it was... I had to flip through the entire book to look for it.<br /><br />The book is an okay guidebook, especially if you only expect to spend a few days in the area and you don't want to invest in a heavy tome. But before my next trip to LA, I'm going to shop for another guide, to see if someone else can do a better job.he book makes many of the listings TOO brief, however.

This one has Cochem Castle on the Mosel River; the port of Hamburg; houses in Dinkelsb&uuml;hl; the Berlin cathedral; Freudenberg, in North Rhine-Westphalia (that's the one on the cover, which you see here on Amazon); Wernigerode, in Sachen-Anhalt; Travelm&uuml;nde in Schleswig-Holstein; Castle Lichtensetin in Baden-W&uuml;rtemberg; G&ouml;ttingen in Lower Saxony; Castle Albrechtsberg on the River Elbe; Niedernjesa in Lower Saxony; and the skyline of Munich. They're all very pretty. It'll certainly do a good job at decorating my kitchen wall for all of 2006.<br /><br />However, you turn to a calendar for date management, too; otherwise you could just frame photos. This one is good. Not only does it have the next and previous month displayed, but the events shown are truly international. July 17 is Ocean Day in Japan and Constitution Day in Korea.	2005-08-29

They mostly have a \\"country\\" feel rather than embellished avant garde quilting. (Not that I think you'd mind, but you might has well have the right expectations.) They're in varying color schemes, so it's bound to match your decor at some point during the year.<br /><br />This is also a functional calendar, with next- and previous-month listings (my current calendar forces me to flip back and forth, which is annoying), as well as the usual American holidays.<br /><br />In addition to the quilt photos, the calendar promises that it includes instructions on how to make each one. I didn't put a lot of hope on that feature, because I assumed the instructions would require me to cut up the calendar -- and what if I liked the October quilt and wanted to make it in April? So I was particularly impressed that the instruction are a 28-page booklet  attached to the last page. You can (and I probably will) detach it so you can make the quilts independently.<br /><br />This would sure look good on your craft-room wall. Personally, it'll be put to work in my office -- I could use its bright color scheme and large, readable print.	2005-08-29

The book does a great job of explaining how to think about stencilling a room or window, and the author also has a good sense of humor. There are lots and LOTS of symbols and figures, though many of them are fairly small so you'll have to blow them up with a photocopier.<br /><br />How helpful is it? While I appreciate the overview, and it helped me understand the process, our tools have (thankfully) improved since 1910! I'm probably going to read another book on basic stenciling before I start decorating my living room -- but I probably will be satisfied with a library book. (There are some black-and-white line drawings in Sutherland's book, but no how-to color photos.) I think this one will be the one I'll turn to, over time, for actually _doing_ the work rather than learning the basic skills.<br /><br />The author was clearly involved in the Arts & Crafts movement, so this is as authentic as you can get. The patterns and motifs are absolutely lovely (assuming you like Arts & Crafts, bungalow, and  Mission style as much as I do), and there are plenty of \\"Oh cool, I hadn't thought of that!\\" suggestions, such as for ceiling treatments, that make me glad I bought this book.	2005-08-28

As a beginning quilter, I figured I could use all the help I could get. However, the book languished on my side table for quite a while, because I began with the wrong expectations.<br /><br />Most books for novices are \\"follow the bouncing ball,\\" showing you how to create a project step-by-step. This one is different; it's more of a visual encyclopedia. So, if you're trying to learn the basics (first you choose the fabric, then you cut it, then you stitch...), start with another book before this one.<br /><br />But DO pick up the Quilters Ultimate Visual Guide, because it's a truly excellent reference book. At some point, you'll have a \\"simple\\" question for which you don't know the answer, and this book seems to have them.<br /><br />Case in point: I've finished a small wall quilt. (Yay!) I want to hang it up. How the heck do I do that? This book shows me several options, including how to construct a sleeve to hold a dowel, and advice about using a dowel versus a curtain rod.<br /><br />It's not the first quilt book you should buy. But it's sure to find its way into your collection.	2005-08-13
US	53079248	R1INU3FGO6IFMN	0802714471	585623524	A History Of The World In Six Glasses	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Enjoyable, even if it isn't very deep	The premise of this book is great, and the author does a good job of covering the territory. Essentially, he explains the importance of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca Cola as a historical catalyst. The Pilgrims landed in Plymouth because they ran out of beer; sea exploration was enhanced because spirits (such as rum) took up less storage room and didn't spoil (as beer will); the Pope blessed coffee, so that consuming it wouldn't be sinful (after all, it was a drink that came from the infidel Arabs). And so on.<br /><br />If you're looking for lightweight mind candy that's also educational, A History of the World in Six Glasses will be just dandy.<br /><br />Although Standish does a good job, it's best to think of this book as an introduction to gastronomy-as-history. If you do get seriously interested in the ways that food and drink moved history along in its path, though, you'll find at least a few options for further exploration. For example, you might want to check out _Beer in America: The Early Years--1587-1840_ to understand its role in the American Revolution in more depth. I'd wholeheartedly recommend _Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How It Transformed Our World_ by Mark Pendergrast. And I'd encourage you to dive into _Nathaniel's Nutmeg_ by Giles Milton, to learn more about the spice trade (so THAT's why the Dutch traded away New Amsterdam to the British!). These books are much more in depth, which is both their strength and weakness. You might want 60 pages about coffee's role in history rather than 300. But, since I'd read them before I read this book, I found Standage's overview an eensy-bit thin. I don't consider that a serious demerit, however; if you like what you read here (and I think you will), you'll simply be glad to discover that there's more to learn.	2005-08-10
US	53079248	R48KB9J0X2OEC	1588163989	479420212	The Good Housekeeping Cookbook	Books	3	34	39	N	N	Acceptable general cookbook, but there are better options	Ordinarily, I wouldn't have bought this book. However, I received The Good Housekeeping Cookbook as a premium for joining a club, so I've examined it with an eye to where it'll fit into my collection.<br /><br />Everybody needs one or two general cookbooks. Even if you're a devoted foodie and you love to cook, at some point you have a hankering for a basic middle-America comfort food dish, maybe an old favorite from your childhood. I discovered this years ago, when I realized that, despite an impressive collection, I didn't have a single recipe for tuna fish casserole.<br /><br />At first glance, the Good Housekeeping Cookbook looks like a candidate for the job. It has 1,500 recipes, frequent photographs of the finishd dish, and 24 chapters that range from meat to quick breads to canning and freezing. In an effort to \\"update\\" the 1950s-style recipes to modern tastes, you'll find recipes for jerk chicken, Thai beef with basil, and tofu egg salad. If you're the sort of person who only wants to own one cookbook, the sheer number of options will keep you quite happy. Even though it doesn't have a tuna noodle casserole after all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those recipes are largely disappointing.<br /><br />Oh, they'll work. You'll definitely be able to make something edible for dinner, using this book. It just won't be awesome. It won't be authentic, either, but I don't think the typical buyer for this book is looking for that. As long as it tastes good, that's fine.<br /><br />There are two major problems with this cookbook. One is a pretence of healthy cooking, which basically means a fawning obsequience to the notion of fat-is-bad. For instance, a recipe for cooking a fresh ham has you take off all the skin; the result is sure to be a dried-out lump of meat. Margarine is substituted for butter in a trout meunierre recipe, when that's a dish wherein the butter taste really matters. (It also leaves out capers, but I could live with that.)<br /><br />Yet, the instructions for baking the traditional turkey blithely tell you to stuff the bird (with, I should mention, some pretty good-sounding stuffings); in  recent years, the accepted practice has become to cook the dressing separately, for both health and cooking reasons. (By the time the stuffing is cooked, the turkey is dry.) Also, the turkey photo shows a light-brown bird; it isn't cooked yet!<br /><br />A greater sin is the book's wimpiness when it comes to spicing. I'm not speaking only of a fear of heat, such as the jerk chicken recipe that uses a single jalapeno for a 4-serving meal, or a Cajun Meat Loaf that uses 1/2 tsp cayenne for 2 pounds of meat. The recipes use entirely too light a hand on ANY flavoring, such as the aforementioned caperless fish. \\"Classic Swiss Fondue\\" uses 1 tablespoon of kirsch; most recipes use about 1/4 cup. Roast chicken with 40 cloves of garlic uses only 6 thyme sprigs; most such recipes braise the chicken, and they use a lot more thyme (and celery, which this recipe leaves out). At best, you'll have one-note, bland dinners.<br /><br />Perhaps the book is meant for beginners, I thought. But I don't think it succeeds very well for that purpose, either. There are few \\"serve this with...\\" suggestions for meal planning, which was certainly my big challenge when I first started. Because most beginners are also young (and thus broke), a good beginner's book has lots of options for the budget-conscious; the Good Housekeeping Cookbook is somewhat weak in that regard. And you learn almost nothing about the cooking process, so this book won't help you improve your skills.<br /><br />You might like to cook that way, however. If, like some of my relatives, you're unadventurous when it comes to food, but you simply want ideas for dinner, this book will be adequate. But if you're looking for one basic cookbook, there are better options. One of them is Mark Bittman's How To Cook Everything, which also has a gadzillion recipes; it, however, also has excellent recipes and instruction on how to accomplish new tasks (such as, if I recall correctly, how to butcher a lobster). I also own the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (the one with the red-and-white checked cover), which is where I turn for those \\"basic\\" recipes, such as casseroles and biscuits; I'd certainly choose that book over this one.<br /><br />This book is okay.

Schwartz brings back the memories of the food we (and our parents) grew up with, and provides plenty of history that we never knew.<br /><br />In 21 chapters, Arthur Schwartz covers NYC's food history. For example, a whole chapter is devoted to Delmonico's, which brought us such well-known dishes as the Delmonico steak, Delmonico potatoes, eggs benedict,and lobster newburg; the restaurant introduced the upper crust to such newfangled ingredients as eggplant and artichokes. The restaurant was important as a see-and-be-seen destination, but its less obvious influences are longer-lasting: it was the first successful a la carte restaurant in the U.S.<br /><br />Five chapters are devoted to the food and influences of the major (and many) immigrants who came to New York City: the Germans (from delicatessens to Luchows), the Jews (the interview with Sol Kaplan, the original owner of Guss' Pickles, may make the book worth the purchase price), Italians, Irish, Chinese -- you get the idea. Other chapters focus on something historical or quintessentially New York: hot dogs, the glamour years (including the 21 Club), the golden age of cocktails.<br /><br />Schwartz gives plenty of fun history -- at least it's fun if you have your own memories of Dinty Moore's, or remember your Mom wishing she could go to the Rainbow Room -- as well as a wonderful business and social context (such as the low regard with which the Irish were held in the 1800s, or why Diamond Jim was such a major figure in the City).<br /><br />Even better, he provides recipes for many of the dishes that make New Yorkers most nostalgic. Everything from the original Thousand Island Dressing (introduced at the Waldorf) to a good knish. I haven't tried any of these, but they do make me swoon. (NYC has a reputation for pizza and bagels; the truth is you can get good versions of these in most major cities. Pickles and knishes, though -- that's another matter.)<br /><br />All in all, it's entertaining and interesting -- and a lovely way to bring yourself back to childhood. It'll be a likely present for one of my sisters, who lives in California now; it's probably a good present for any of your ex-NYer friends, too.<br /><br />Would it be as useful for a non-New Yorker? Not quite as much so. My husband grew up on a midwestern farm. Although he lived in NY for a couple of years, and he likes _New York City Food_, this book isn't quite as compelling for him..

There are a lot of things I like about this cookbook. Unlike a lot of \\"American\\" German cooking, the recipes represent regions outside Bavaria. Hannelore Kohl (who, yes, is the wife of the ex-chancellor) divides the book into 9 regions, and presents typical recipes you'd find in each one. About half the recipes are accompanied with a photo of the finished dish, which can be somewhat inspiring. (\\"Yum, that looks good! Maybe I'll make this Winemaker's beef stew tonight!\\")<br /><br />The recipes themselves are of mixed value. Several are excellent. Since we bought this cookbook about five years ago, her recipe for pork goulash with beer and mustard-pickles has become one of our standbys. The Harz potato salad with jagdwurst (smoked ham sausage) makes it worthwhile to search for the ingredients. (Fortunately, I have a good German deli nearby.) The Frankfurt Green Sauce (essentially herbs and sour cream served over hard boiled eggs or boiled potatoes) is really delicious, and one of the simplest versions I've found for this recipe.<br /><br />And, if you're hankering for a huge collection of meat-and-potatoes recipes -- heavy on the meat! -- you need look no further. There's little here for a vegetarian. Not much for chicken and fish, either, though there are a few moments for goose and duck fans. Helmut Kohl must like his pork and beef.<br /><br />A few recipes are less successful. I made her pork roast stuffed with onions; it called for 6 onions. I managed to pry 2 sliced onions into the cavity, and had 4 left over. (Oh well, it's not like onions will go to waste around here.) The meal tasted great, but I do like to think I can rely on the instructions.<br /><br />You'll find plenty of regional specialties, from maultashen (Germany's answer to ravioli) to saurbraten to the Frankfurt specialty \\"hand cheese with music.\\" Sometimes, the recipes are good but not superlative. I always consult this book, but often I use the instructions from another cookbook.<br /><br />The index, frankly, stinks.

I certainly agree with the opinions that this is a very funny, readable and personal story. Many of us -- at least many of us food enthusiasts -- wonder what it would be like to dine out nearly every evening, to constantly judge the merits of a restaurant (how do you keep notes?), to stay anonymous. Heck, I've always wondered how one gets a credit card with a Not-You name on it, a question that Reichl answers in the first few chapters.<br /><br />Those questions alone -- and Reichl's great prose -- make the book entertaining right there. In fact, I snuck out of work early and read the book straight through in a single day. (Shh, don't tell anyone.)<br /><br />However, Garlic and Sapphires exceeds simple enjoyment. Reichl is  occasionally philosophical about what she is doing, by donning wigs and dressing up as other people -- ostensibly in her efforts to be anonymous. She became an actor, really, not Ruth-in-a-wig. Without beating you (or herself) over the head with it, Reichl examines how much of our self-image is wrapped up in our physical presentation.<br /><br />For example, at one point, Shirley -- the woman who sells the wigs -- comments about her customers, most of whom are women with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. \\"Shirley was beaming. 'I wish,' she said fervently, 'that you were here to talk to all my customers. These poor women come in wth no hair on their heads, and they have such a great opportunity to remake themselves. It's their chance to try on new personalities. But what do they want? To look as much like their old selves as possible.'\\" Reichl's friend Carol counters with the opposing view. In only a few paragraphs, you've seen all sides of an \\"identity\\" issue -- in the middle of an anecdote about choosing a carrot red wig.<br /><br />And the food. Did I mention the food? I learned more about fois gras than I ever knew.<br /><br />This book manages to be funny, thoughtful, and educational all at once, and you can read it over a weekend. Thoroughly enjoyable: I recommend it.er knew. <br /> <br />This book manages to be funny, thoughtful, and educational all at once, and you can read it over a weekend.

Julie Sahni's \\"Classic Indian Cooking\\" was one of the first cookbooks I purchased. The cover's long gone; the binding is cracked; many pages have food stains. While I own (and like) at least a half-dozen Indian cookbooks, this is the one I turn to first.<br /><br />Why? The recipes manage to be authentic without intimidation. The author is one of the best at introducing you to something new and unfamiliar: making the subject simultaneously interesting and non-threatening. As others have mentioned, there are no pictures, only a few illustrations, such as how to slash chicken pieces for tandoori marinade; Sahni's prose is so good that you really don't need it. (And face it: with all those yellowish curries, most Indian food isn't aesthetically gorgeous. I've long since decided that, to taste wonderful, Indian food has to look like baby poop. I'm not sure that photos would be helpful for a cook new to Indian cooking.)<br /><br />The book opens automatically to several recipes. I've made each of these dozens of times: tandoori chicken (I've tried other recipes and always come back to this one); samosa (savory pastries with spicy potato filling); kali dal (buttered black beans); khatte channe and safaid channe (chick peas in tamarind  and ginger sauce, respectively -- awesome veggie options, using ingredients I'm likely to have in the cupboard); saffron pilaf with peaches (in fact, when we see the first great peaches in the market, we automatically buy the ingredients for this dish).<br /><br />Some of my cookbooks fall open to one or two favorite recipes. That's not enough for this one, because there are too many recipes that I turn to often. It has several Post-Its sticking out the side, an old envelope stuck in between pages to help me keep my place (this one has a post-date of 1999), a grocery store receipt marking the instructions for making ras malai (which she translates as \\"cheese dumplings in pistachio-flecked cream sauce\\" but I call \\"heaven on earth\\").<br /><br />If I had to cut back to only 5 cookbooks, this would be among them.chio-flecked cream sauce\\" but I call \\"heaven on earth\\").  <br /> <br />If I had to cut back to only 5 cookbooks, this would be among them.	2005-07-17

This friend spends a week at a beach house every summer, so it seemed as though a build-a-sandcastle manual would be just the ticket. After looking through this book, I'm positive that I made the perfect purchase.<br /><br />I haven't made any of the sandcastles personally (Arizona is a little low on beachfront), but the instructions and photos in this book make me yearn to do so. There are LOTS of pictures -- at least two on each page -- and the text gives plenty of advice about sand-sculpting methods, building, and carving. The section on the basics was particularly interesting; so *that*'s why my childhood attempts always fell over!<br /><br />The author writes with a clear voice, and doesn't take herself too seriously. This is about having fun, after all. Even if you're as far from a beach as I am, this is an entertaining book to read!	2005-07-09

My house needs curtains, seat cushions, wall hangings. And I'm new to all of this; while I'm just-past-novice at sewing and quilting, I've never even paid attention to how one constructs a pillow.<br /><br />As a result, I've looked at several books about home decor, and I've bought a few. So far, this book has helped more than the rest of 'em put together.<br /><br />First, it doesn't try to make you a specialist. I don't need to make curtains in dozens of styles; I just want to make a few ordinary ones that look nice. By separating the book into sections, I get the most common designs without the advanced stuff I don't expect to need, and I don't have to buy four books. (Well, I probably wouldn't have bought one for tables, anyway.)<br /><br />Another advantage to its lack of specialization is that it includes a few items you wouldn't find elsewhere, such as instructions for making a shower curtain. As it happens, I'd already finished that project before I got this book, but these would have helped me just as well. (As an aside: after making a shower curtain from scratch, I'd never buy another one. It's so easy, and it looks wonderful.)<br /><br />Also, this book gives very clear instructions, with photos that really DO show the process. It also doesn't make assumptions about your sewing skill, or your comfort with the equipment. For me, the \\"Aha!\\" moment came when it explained that it may be helpful to use a walking foot (more commonly used in quilting) to deal with heavy or bulky fabrics. I'd already ripped out the seams on a seat cushion *twice* by the time I read that, and had become disheartened with the project. Armed with that single bit of knowledge, the project was finished in a weekend.<br /><br />I've another cushion project to start -- my husband is building a window seat -- and then it's time to begin on the curtains and window shades. I did buy a few curtain-specific books, but I suspect I'll turn to this one first.this one first.	2005-07-04

As you can see from the rating I've given it, The Wine Lover Cooks With Wine is a winner.<br /><br />In his earlier book, the Wine Lover's Cookbook (which I also like a lot), the author's premise was that you had a special bottle of wine and wanted to make a dish that would complement it. This one is similar, in that wine is an inextricable part of the meal. Primarily it's an ingredient, though each recipe also has two what-to-drink recommendations to accompany it, which may not be the same as the wine used in cooking. (For instance, the Asian eggplant salad, which I'm apt to make as \\"what to take to the Fourth of July BBQ,\\" suggests serving either sake or riesling.)<br /><br />I think the author was stretching his definitions in a few places, because some recipes use only a little wine; that is, don't expect that you'll neccesarily be pouring 2 cups of expensive stuff into your dinner.<br /><br />However, the \\"about wine\\" portion of this book isn't the key ingredient, so to speak. It's about cooking, and this is a REALLY nice cookbook. Some of the recipes sound fancy, as though you'd be likely to find them in the kind of white-tablecloth restaurant where the waiters speak in hushed tones and begin by asking, \\"Would you like sparkling or still water with your meal?\\"<br /><br />However, most of the recipes are, if not dead easy, simple enough for you to make on a weeknight for the family, and delicious enough for them to say \\"Wow!\\" For example, I made \\"Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Spicy Orange-Port Reduction,\\" served with his recommendation of cinnamon-scented couscous. (But not the wine, which happened to be Zinfandel or Merlot; as it turns out, I've made most of the recipes at lunchtime, when I have to go back to work afterwards. Darnit.) This is essentially a \\"marinate and then brown the meat, create a pan sauce, and reduce\\" recipe. You've done that plenty of times, but with less interesting liquids.<br /><br />Best of all, this is an inexpensive cookbook; at least half the recipes have useful and attractive photos, too, which are rather inspiring.of times, but with less interesting liquids. <br /> <br />Best of all, this is an inexpensive cookbook; at least half the recipes have useful and attractive photos, too, which are rather inspiring.	2005-07-02

I wanted a short-and-sweet guidebook that would direct me to the places I most needed to see (expected destinations like Pike Place Market), as well as a few less obvious places to go. Since I couldn't spend very long in town, I wanted something small and portable enough to stuff in my purse. Top 10 Seattle did a good job at this goal.<br /><br />In addition to the top ten overall spots, and in some cases the top ten at each spot (such as the most important places to see at the aforementioned market), the book covers each of the major neighborhoods, with recommendations in each one. Not all of them are \\"tourist\\" spots, either; for instance, it directs you to walk a few blocks off Broadway (where I was staying) to check out the architecture of area homes. That was good advice, and I wouldn't have ventured that way on my own.<br /><br />Each neighborhood gets restaurant recommendations, too; we relied on it for one or two meals and were generally pleased. There's also shopping recommendations, though I didn't explore them as much.<br /><br />The book also has very clear maps, which was definitely appreciated, though I'm not sure how helpful they'd be if you go outside their major areas of focus.<br /><br />Where the book falls down is in the details. Not the info on each site (it's tiny, that's what I wanted) but in logistics. If it's 10am on Sunday, which of these places will be open? Should I go downtown on the off-chance that the museum is open? The book gave me no guidance.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this was a good book to carry along on a short trip. I'd do it again.	2005-06-28

There's plenty of information for someone wholly new to the subject. What's harder to find is a book for someone like me, who knows the general differences between grape varieties but is far from confident in ordering or picking a bottle for dinner.<br /><br />Despite its age -- this book dates from 1996 -- A Perfect Glass of Wine does the job. St. Pierre covers each grape variety in detail (5 or 6 pages), as well as a worthwhile section on choosing glassware and accessories (corkscrews and decanters). You'll also find lots of pretty photos, though they add no illumination to the text.<br /><br />The book is entertaining for the anecdotes (such as a story about the Rhone Rangers, fans of Rhone wines). However, it's especially educational for people who want more than a description of riesling's acidity or even which dishes work well with it (the author recommends cold, cracked Dungeness crab and sourdough, for instance).<br /><br />St. Pierre includes these, but what I found most valuable was his unabashed opinions about wines from each geography. For instance, still in the riesling section, he says, \\"California has had success with both styles, but not enough . . . They had great fun challenging Germany's best, but consumers, not sure of what they were getting when they bought a bottle, opted out.\\"<br /><br />The writing is often simply great, including quotes that make the wine business seem personal (\\"As Dan Duckhorn, one of the prime [Merlot] movers, later said wryly, 'We had a steep experience curve.'\\"). And he explains the variations in, say, Merlot, in terms understandable to a not-quite-beginner.<br /><br />You DO have to keep in mind that the book is dated. From the text, it's evident that the pinot-grigio-everywhere craze hadn't quite taken off when this was written. But so what? I really enjoyed this book, and I think you will, too.	2005-06-26

The author has to make the situation worse-and-worse for the protagonist, yet move the story forward. Yet, very little can be resolved, because there's a Book 3 to follow.<br /><br />Kritzer does a great job. In the first book of this trilogy (don't even think of skipping it; you'd be lost), Lauria re-thought her role in the world. Instead of doing whatever Kyros wanted (in particular, catching slaves and returning them to their owners), she joined a peculiar rebellion, and earned a sense of purpose. (I won't say more, in case you didn't finish Freedom's Gate yet.)<br /><br />In Freedom's Apprentice, Lauria aims to free all the slaves she'd previously recaptured, as atonement for her previous actions. As she travels around her world -- joined by her blood-sister Tamar -- she learns more about the nature of magic, what it takes to control it, and sets an even larger goal.<br /><br />Oh dear, that sounds like the vague \\"back of the book\\" text, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers. The bottom line is that this second book is at least as good as the first; the author makes her world and her people believeable; and this tale is a fine place in which to lose yourself for a few hours. Recommended.	2005-05-18

I had household projects to finish, a few errands to run, that sort of thing. None of them were accomplished, because -- for the first time in a long time -- I fell headfirst into a novel and didn't even want to climb out.<br /><br />Dissolution was a good book, which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, because \\"murder in a monastary\\" is a familiar trope, it doesn't have as much of a sense of surprise or historical interest. Or perhaps the author is simply getting better with each book -- which is quite an accomplishment, considering how well he writes now.<br /><br />Dark Fire succeeds on a number of levels. The protogaonist is interesting, both as a man of his times and an \\"enlightened\\" person who considers difficult questions. The writing immerses the reader in the era: not just the intertwined mysteries to be solved, but the smell of the Thames, the desperation of the beggars who once worked for the monastaries, the fascination with the discoveries arriving from the New World. And boy -- did Sansom pick an interesting time to write about, with political and religious upheaval that affected nearly everyone.<br /><br />Yet, he doesn't let the scenery get in the way of the story. As with most mysteries, it's difficult to discuss the plot without giving it away. I'll just say that it's deliciously complex without being so twisty that you lose track of what's happening.<br /><br />Great book, in other words. The sort we all love to discover. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a novel to keep your mind  engaged without requiring serious scholarship.	2005-05-09

Yet, I know (with vast experience) that sometimes the add-on gizmos are junk; if you want to do the job right, buy the right tool. So I bought this book when I was buying other parts, and I needed to fill out the order to get free shipping.<br /><br />I'm glad that I got the book, because it did help me make a decision. Perhaps the best part of this book is a chapter that enumerates grain mill sources (including Internet URLs) and evaluates each mill available. For instance, my add-on is described as having (among other attributes) \\"flour texture adequate but not superfine; offers many attachments including oat flaker, grater that handles nuts, and meat grinder that makes peanut butter.\\"<br /><br />So, if you're looking for help in making a decision about investing money in a grain mill, this book definitely will help. In my case, it saved me money. Now that I know the process of grinding, etc., I realize I probably won't bother with the attachment (at least not until my kitchen remodel is done and I have more storage space).<br /><br />However, the book has a lot more information, which you may welcome or, like me, find a bit \\"much.\\" The author spends several chapters explaining how grain is milled nowadays, the virtues of fiber, and an analysis of all the great nutrients to be found in whole grain bread. With *great* detail, but no pictures. I've been a health-food person for 20+ years; while she did a good job of imparting the information, there was little I didn't know and hey, I was sold on this stuff long ago. (If we don't make our own multi-grain bread, we buy it at a whole foods market.)<br /><br />In addition to its health benefits, the author gives \\"self sufficiency\\" as another primary reason to mill your own grain. If this is something that's important to you, you probably already know it. For me, that's a ho-hum point. I already did my time living on an island off the coast of Maine, learning how to cook on a 100+-year-old wood stove. Its charm wore off after the tenth load of wood I had to bring in. I'm all for self-sufficiency, as long as I don't have to work up a sweat.<br /><br />Anyway, the strength of this book is very much in the last half of the book, which explains how to choose a mill (electric? hand-cranked? a community mill?), the classes of wheat (I learned quite a bit in this section), and other grist for your mill (such as quinoa or rye). She even discusses the mundane details of how to store grain and deal with pests. There's a few recipes, but these are mainly guides for people new to whole-grain cooking.<br /><br />The problem is an overload of information. I didn't need three or four chapters to explain why squishy white bread is bad and why fresh grain is better. If you're considering this book, you probably don't, either. Even though the information is well-intended and the author clearly believes what she's talking about, after a while, the explanations begin to sound like lectures (\\"Okay, mom, I HEAR YOU!\\"). I found it off-putting. The book could easily have been a (5 star) 75-page pamphlet instead of a 262 page book, and sell for a list price of $10 instead of $15.<br /><br />But if you're interested in milling your own whole grain, don't let my criticisms stop you.

More likely, you like deviled eggs, but you're a little tired of the standard repetoire. Or you cook for people who like non-threatening food, and you want to throw a little excitement in their lives.<br /><br />In any of these situations, you might consider this little cookbook, which does indeed have 50 recipes for deviled eggs. These sort of books can be rather lame; I've certainly encountered several of them that have two or three decent recipes, and then two dozen recipes that you'd never consider making.<br /><br />Happily, this sweet little book avoids that trap. It's separated into several sections: the hard facts (an introduction to boiling eggs and other preperatory steps); good old eggs (the expected batch); slightly cracked (interesting variations); lucifer goes uptown (fancy recipes, such as one that uses caviar); and hell breaks loose (spicy recipes).<br /><br />The introductory section is a little sparse. While it does provide some tips on cooking the eggs (such as turning your carton of eggs on its side, to ensure that the yolks are centered for easy fillin), it leaves out a few more suggestions that I think are common. (For instance, I long ago learned to make the filling inside a Ziploc sandwhich bag, then cut off the corner to  squish it into the eggs... no mess, and evenly mixed filling.)<br /><br />But the star here is the recipes, and they're... they're NICE. There are about 10 recipes for your basic deviled egg, one of which is sure to match the way your Mom made them. (With or without Worcestershire sauce, for instance.) I've made one or two of these and they came out fine. Okay, I should admit that I scarfed down the whole batch and didn't leave any for anybody else.<br /><br />The \\"slightly cracked\\" section uses various unusual (but not weird) ingredients, such as avocado or deviled ham. Some of these veer into the \\"ya gotta be kidding\\" range, such as \\"strawberry cheesecakes on the half shell.\\"<br /><br />But the author makes up for it with the fancy stuff, which has recipes for deviled eggs based on bloody marys or served with hollandaise. And the spicy variations are sure to appeal to the \\"if it's hot it's good\\" crowd, with one recipe using chipotle pepper and orange zest; another is \\"wasabi tuna eggs.\\"<br /><br />It's not haute cuisine, but it's a useful little book. If you're called upon for potluck dinners or office parties, it'd be a handy one to have on the shelf.rry cheesecakes on the half shell.\\" <br /> <br />But the author makes up for it with the fancy stuff, which has recipes for deviled eggs based on bloody marys or served with hollandaise.

(\\"No, move it more to the left!\\" or \\"The dough should feel like _this_.\\") Alas, we don't always have someone to call upon, so we turn to books written by experts. Often, they know their skill... but are imperfect at getting the point across.<br /><br />That's not a problem here. \\"Finish It With Alex Anderson\\" is very much like having a friend standing at your side. While it includes 6 full quilt projects (they're nice, but not astonishing), the primary emphasis of this book is on -- as promised -- the steps in finishing a quilt, making good design choices for borders and other \\"edgy\\" issues.<br /><br />I'm a rank beginner at quilting, and I've gotten confused over the stupidest things. For example, I know that it's easy to miter corners on the binding... once you know how. Most books give an arm wave to what's involved, as if you've seen it done and simply need a reminder. Alex Anderson's shows several different ways to bind a quilt, with so many pictures that I can't do it wrong. And, in fact, I didn't; my binding looks great, and I finally understand what I'd missed before.<br /><br />Great book. This one won't get far from the sewing machine.	2005-03-26

The first, on applying color theory, is pretty good, and made me want to learn more. Ah, I thought. Now that I have the basics, the rest of the book will go into the subject in more depth.<br /><br />But it didn't work that way. Instead of extending the initial overview (which covers the effects of different color palettes on decorating rooms), the second section switches into an introduction to faux finishes and how to apply them. That's very nice, but it it's no longer about decorating with color; it's now about decorating with paint.<br /><br />More formally, the sections of the book include: A sense of color; the color palette; color effects in your home (which sounds like color theory but the first subhead is \\"quick paint effects\\"); color and style (primarily the use of stencils).<br /><br />I took the book out the library, so I'm happy to have picked up the bit of wisdom this book had to impart. However, I suspect there are much better books out there to serve my initial impulse: to learn how to choose colors for my new home.	2005-03-22

In a sense, that's what the author has examined here: if you had the single \\"magic\\" capability of swapping between two universes in a flash... what could you accomplish that you couldn't do now? What would you bring back and forth, and who would benefit?<br /><br />It's a great premise, and the author does a good (not blow-me-away-wow but good) job at exploring it. Miriam is a high-tech journalist who loses her job and, on the same day, through a series of mishaps, discovers that staring at her birth mother's locket can bring her to an alternate universe. (It's in the same place as Boston, for instance... just a different history that brought the people there.)<br /><br />Do be aware that this is the first of a series; the author doesn't wrap up very much at the end, so you may not feel as though the book has closure. Also, the story is heavy on political intrigue, and brings up economic theory; that may be a turn-off or something you appreciate.<br /><br />While the story isn't perfect -- there were a few places in which I thought the protagonist simply wouldn't DO that -- the book held my interest, and I stayed up late to finish it.  It also re-sparked our old discussions about what you could do with this particular single magic spell: would *you* have made the same decisions that Miriam did? that her family did? Any novel that instigates philosophical conversations gets a positive nod.	2005-03-03

(God forbid that anybody see all my mistakes) This book has helped me move to the next level, by giving me both the inspiration and the clear instructions to create a baby quilt for my nephew's first child. I'm doing the quilting now, and I feel really good about giving this (adorable) quilt to the new baby.<br /><br />Among the things I appreciated is that EVERY quilt has a full color photo, with enough detail for me to figure out how it's supposed to go together. There are plenty of choices, all of which are simple and attractive. (Okay, \\"incredibly cute\\" is probably a better description. But the designs are all sweet rather than sappy.)<br /><br />Also, the instructions are very clear about how much fabric you need, so I didn't feel as though I had to make guesses or rely on my unconfidant quilting math.<br /><br />If you're a first timer, this may not be your very first quilting book; there are others that do a more thorough job about the basics of rotary cutting, for instance. But if you're like me, for your first non-table-runner project you want something that's manageable but non-trivial. This book is a great guide in achieving that goal.	2005-02-21

If what you want is an overview demonstrating how gorgeous a bathroom can be, given an unlimited budget and (often) a lot of space, then you'll probably find this a five-star book.<br /><br />That wasn't what I was hoping for, however, so I'm personaly a little disappointed. First, when you can buy the finest (such as lots of marble) then it's easy to create something beautiful. For my purposes... as a new homeowner, I've been considering doing one of my bathrooms with an Asian theme. This book didn't give me much in the way of ideas for that. On the other hand, it's so pretty that I don't really mind.	2005-01-19

They're great \\"take my mind out of gear\\" easy afternoon reads, like watching an old Kathryn Hepburn movie. (Okay, so it's implausible. So what?)<br /><br />This novel continues where the last one left off (it starts barely a month later), but it's not quite as satisfying. The author got a little too caught up in the \\"zanyness\\" of her characters (and in my book, \\"zany\\" lives right next to \\"slam the book shut\\"), and forgot about telling a murder mystery.<br /><br />Or... sort of. I did zoom through the book in a couple of evenings of bedtime reading. So I can't be complaining TOO much about the plot. It certainly held my interest.<br /><br />In short: this is an enjoyable diversion. If you haven't read anything by this author before, however, you should definitely start with the first two in the series. If you've read them... you'll probably like this book, but shouldn't feel as though you MUST rush to buy it immediately.<br /><br />(But can anyone figure out why Amazon has this listed under Italian cookbooks?!)	2005-01-18

The universe that the author created is interesting, the characters are largely believeable, and the tale kept my interest. It was a fine book to read on an airline flight... not a story to change one's life, but better-than-usual mind candy.<br /><br />Some of the society's features were rather appealing, such as a monthly tradition among the townspeople to state your Intentions (i.e. your current short-term goals) and report how you'd done on the last one. Other story elements are a little simplistic, but not in an annoying way.<br /><br />Adults shouldn't think this is a story only for kids; I didn't realize this book was classified as Young Adult until I looked at the Amazon listing. The writing isn't \\"childish\\" in any way, though there's nothing offensive to younger readers.	2005-01-14

On the plus side, it offers suggestions for gifts beyond the straightforward baby quilt; for instance, one quilt design also has instructions for making matching baby bibs, and another has a matching stuffed animal to accompany the quilt. That's quite charming. However, the designs are just a little too \\"sweet\\" for my taste.<br /><br />More importantly, the book isn't quite sure whether it's for beginners or for more advanced quilters. It devotes 35 pages to basics, but the project recipes are surprisingly sparse. For instance, the instructions say to make 6.5\\" square blocks, but never tell you \\"you'll need 2 yards of Fabric 1, 3 yards of Fabric 2.\\"<br /><br />I did get some good ideas from this book. However, to make a baby quilt for my nephew's first child, I'm going to turn elsewhere for guidance.	2005-01-09

Nigella Lawson seems to be the kind of cookbook author who causes people to respond to *her* more than her recipes. I suppose some of that is inevitable, as she has the sort of sultry girl-next-door looks that make us ordinary women contemplate a pact with the devil. But the book is, after all, about the recipes and menu guidance she provides. And I think she does a very good job at that, indeed.<br /><br />This isn't simply a \\"holiday recipes\\" book; Lawson takes the \\"feast\\" theme to heart, and gives recipes for all sorts of occasions in which you're apt to be called to the kitchen. Sure, that includes Thanksgiving and Christmas (which she lumps together), as well as Valentine's day and Rosh Hashanah. But it also includes \\"a Georgian feast\\"  (whose menu includes green beans in herbed yogurt, walnut crescents, and a chicken stuffed with basmati, garlic, and sour cherries), several feasts for making with/for children (the Halloween recipes include a \\"slime soup\\" -- actually a pea and cheese soup), and even a set of dishes to cook for funerals and grieving friends. Not to mention feasts for oneself, such as things to cook at midnight.<br /><br />As you may have gathered, these recipes are organized by the nature of the event, which could get tedious if you wanted to look for all the soup recipes. But isn't that the point?<br /><br />The recipes -- let's get to the meat of the matter, so to speak. While I don't think I'm going to change all my traditional dishes, I'm guaranteed to be inspired by some of her suggestions. I certainly am looking forward to using up my Thanksgiving turkey leftovers in her \\"North American Salad\\" (wild rice, dried cranberries, cooked turkey, cranberry sauce, pecans and parsley). The \\"easy holiday trifle\\" -- which uses dried apricots, cardamom, and a panettone -- is likely to be my contribution to the Christmas buffet. And I'm planning to make the \\"stilton rarebit with walnut and bibb lettuce salad\\" this weekend. Hmm, maybe I'll do it _now_.<br /><br />I own a lot of cookbooks that seem to have only one or two good recipes.

I'm not speaking only of those wherein the hero or heroine has to collect \\"plot coupons\\" (get the sword, pick up the magic stone, take them to the castle or you do not pass Go or collect $200). All too often, the author puts the main character in a situation that is obvious: she has to realize or accomplish Something Important and gosh, you think she will?<br /><br />In this novel (and in her previous series), Kritzer avoids these traps. Others have summarized the story pretty well: our heroine is the servant of a big cheese among the longtime Greek conquerers (in an alternate history wherein Alexander lived to a ripe old age before ascending to godhood, and wherein djinn have been enslaved). She's sent on a mission to inflitrate the \\"bad guys\\"... and ends up rethinking everything she knows about her society.<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn, even the minor ones. The writing held my attention. But what really impressed me was how often Kritzer surprised me: Lauria doesn't take the simple way out, she agonizes over her changing opinions, and at the end she is a very real, believeable character.<br /><br />This isn't a huge tome, either: it's suitable for a fun weekend read, not a lifelong commitment. Recommended.	2004-09-18

Aha, I thought: I've wanted a collection of Polynesian recipes, and this one is pretty darned inexpensive.<br /><br />Alas, I'm disappointed in what the book delivers. I had expected it to be a hoot, especially since I was initially recommended the book because I'd purchased and enjoyed The Gallery Of Regrettable Food. Instead, Retro Luau really does feel like a 1950s cookbook (with \\"retro\\" illustrations to match), with recipes including macadamia cheese puffs, upside-down pineapple cake, and teriyaki beef skewers.<br /><br />None of the recipes are *bad*, mind you (though they're heavy on mayonnaise in a 1950s sort of way). The next time I need to take a covered dish to a buffet party I'm sure I'll look through Retro Luau for inspiration, if not bring along the sweet-and-sour meatball recipe. If you want food like Mom used to make, and don't want to expend a lot of effort, this may be a good choice for you.<br /><br />But you should be aware that this is definitely a cookbook for creating a luau, complete with instructions for roasting a whole pig and how to make a lei. It is emphatically not a collection of Polynesian recipes that you might whip out for a different Sunday dinner. The book description says this, of course, but I hadn't expected nearly everything to be finger-food and munchies to serve 8-10 at a minimum. (Happy Ham Salad serves 20-25 people.)<br /><br />I may pull out this cookbook occasionally (especially since a close friend has a yearly luau-inspired party), but I don't expect any of its pages to get dog-earred.	2004-08-31

It's a good book -- but I can't work up my enthusiasm for it.<br /><br />For one thing: even though the photography is attractive, it's not terribly useful. Presumably to both save money and to give a sense of size-and-scale, most of the vegetable photos have several items in the same picture (Chinese broccoli next to choy sum next to mustard cabbage), with little circles (TOO-little circles) indicating the item highlighted in the text. The veggie photos are also smaller than the recipe photos; personally, I'd rather a good hard look at a healthy bunch of greens than a full-page picture of Asian gumbo with mustard cabbage and chinese sausage (however appealing that recipe might be).<br /><br />The information given is also... well, not quite minimal, but far from exhaustive. While the entry for Lotus root in Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini is two or three pages (plus recipes), there's really only 3 paragraphs devoted to it here. It's good information, mind you, just not that much of it.<br /><br />But note that I do give the book 4 stars. If you're completely new to Asian cooking, then this inexpensive book may be helpful (and a fatter book would be overwhelming).	2004-07-24

As a result, I tend to cook with natural sweeteners: honey and maple syrup in particular. This book caught my eye, because few cookbooks use honey as a primary sweetener (except for some health food cookbooks, which can still lean precariously towards the carrot-loaf crowd). Using honey adds liquid to recipes as well as throwing off the amount that recipes call for, so often it's not simply a matter of substitution. <br />  <br /> This book is better at the &quot;connoisseur's guide&quot; than at the recipes, though I have no complaint with the latter. It's just that the introductory section has a thoroughly enjoyable section on the flavors of honey (lavendar, buckwheat, chestnut) which I haven't seen anywhere else, and a list of sources for those of us who don't live near a great gourmet store. <br />  <br /> I *have* seen most of the recipes elsewhere, though these appear to be very nice versions, and the breadth of topics is admirable. The recipe chapters include bread and muffins; fruits and vegetables; main dishes; cookies and cakes; pies and tarts; other desserts; and syrups and toppings. Much of these are &quot;sweets&quot; (well DUH), and anyone looking for a natually-sweetened version of crispy walnut cookies or fresh gingerbread will be pleased to find them here. The book does fine with main courses too, from spiced honeyed carrots (your basic Thanksgiving side dish) to a recipe for pork loin roasted with orange and ginger that I'm itching to try. <br />  <br /> This is far from an exhaustive tome, but then it's an inexpensive book. It's quite an enjoyable cookbook, even if it doesn't blow my socks off.	2004-07-21

As a result, I grew up on boxed mixes: Bisquick, hamburger helper, and plenty of &quot;just add a pound of hamburger&quot; dinners. (How did I become a foodie after that upbringing?)<br />So, on one level I enjoyed this book because it brought back all the weird foods of of childhood, &quot;home cookin', box mix style.&quot; The author mentions plenty of dishes that would make us curl our noses today, involving peanut butter, Jello, and miniature marshmallows in configurations that MUST be illegal in some states.<br />However, what I found more interesting was the discussion of how we got from there-to-here. How and why did the food industry shove down the throat of the American housewife all these &quot;convenience foods&quot;? To my surprise, housewives resisted far more strenuously than my mother did. Cake mixes, for example, were roundly ignored until a psychologist realized that women didn't think they were &quot;really cooking&quot; unless they added an egg. (The fact that powdered eggs of the era were pretty awful also had something to do with it.) Also, the food industry was clueless about the products that *worked*: if frozen fish sticks will sell, then why not frozen chicken sticks? or frozen eggplant sticks?<br />A little less interesting (but still worth 3 stars, on its own) are the biographies of several of the people who had an impact on the food consciousness of the 50s and 60s, such as Poppy Cannon (whom I'd never heard of) and Julia Child.<br />From reading the reviews here, I rather expected that I'd find a lot of the data in this book interesting, and I wasn't disappointed. To my surprise, I also found the author to have a delightful sense of humor, and unafraid to insert her own opinions.<br />If you enjoy books about food, history, and how they intersect with people -- such as Uncommon Grounds by Pendergrast, or Kurlansky's Salt -- you'll almost certainly like this book.ertainly like this book.	2004-07-10

While I like the premise, this book wasn't compelling enough to make me feel as though it had to be in my collection.<br />There are, indeed, some very good recipes in here, as the other reviewers mentioned. Nothing that I couldn't live without, but I could certainly put together a few Sunday dinners from this list.<br />However, I'm dubious about the claim that each of these chefs put together a dinner for four on $20. If they managed it, they certainly don't shop where I do.<br />To be fair, one of the tenets of cooking frugally is to buy in season -- a point the compilers and the chefs do make. One additional suggestion, which they didn't highlight but should, is to buy locally. There's no way that, in Arizona, I'm going to buy *any* amount of lobster (for an appetizer, even) and keep the dinner budget under $20. Back when I lived on an island off the coast of Maine, where the dinner decision is &quot;Do you want lobster, honey, or would you prefer a hamburger?&quot; it would have been another story.  (You don't want to know what we Arizonans have to play for blueberries, either.)<br />As it turns out, most of the contributors to this cookbook are on one coast or another, so many of the most delicious-sounding recipes will exceed the arbitrary dollar amount.<br />That doesn't mean that this isn't a good cookbook. It really is quite nice. But if your eye moved to this listing because you're trying to cook well on a budget, you'll be disappointed. (As just one alternative... back when I had to watch every penny, I found Molly Katzen's original Moosewood Cookbook to be a good way to eat well and still have money left at the end of the week.)	2004-06-15

While most travel books devote a few pages (at most) for a museum, this one spends 22 pages on the National Gallery alone.<br />In addition to the mundane details, such as opening hours, charges, and tube station -- which are a lot less mundane when you're in need of that data! -- the museum listings show you the highlights (i.e. the art you'll want to see if you're on a mad rush), plenty of maps, and a wing-by-wing guide. For example, for rooms 52-53 of the National Gallery, it says (in part), &quot;The paintings in this room and the next were made before 1400, and show how the rather static, frontal style we recognize from Byzantine icons gradually incorporated greater realism, through the influence of Giotto.&quot; And then it tells you a bit about the paintings (or whatever) you're looking at. I'm not sure this is better than a live guide, but it's sure an improvement from wandering around the place, feeling as though I'm supposed to be impressed but unsure why.<br />The book gives detailed information about these museums: National Gallery, Courtauld Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, British Museum, Wallace Collection, Sir John Sloane's Museum, Tate Modern, Saatchi Gallery, Tate Britian, Queen's Gallery, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Each is grouped by neighborhood, so you can plan your day at Westminster or South Kensington, etc.<br />If that's all it did, it might be worth the modest price... assuming you're doing a trip devoted to museums. But if, like me, you'll spend only a bit of time in the museums,  buying (and lugging along) a book solely on that subject might seem silly.<br />However, that's where I was pleasantly surprised. Art/Shop/Eat London really does live up to the Shop/Eat part of the equation. For each neighbhorhood, the book includes a section called &quot;On Route,&quot; which lists commercial galleries as well as other, and smaller attractions (such as the London Transport Museum or the Photographer's Gallery). You'll also find a list of shopping destinations in the surrounding area, everything from bookstores to clothes to kids' stores.<br />*Quite* appreciated is a description of the eating and drinking at both the museums themselves and restaurants in the surrounding area.

Rather than try to show every street (you'll have an ordinary map for that), he makes it easy to find the places you probably care about (or the ones he thinks you should care about); the museums, train station, etc. are easy to find -- like the map you'd scribble on a cocktail napkin for a friend. Plus, he's reassuring about distances from one place to another (a ten-minute walk to the museum from the train station, etc.).<br />He also does a good-to-excellent job at, hmm, how shall I put this -- describing the experience of a place. I haven't been to Munich, yet, and his is the only guide that tells me that the biergarten tables with no tablecloths are reserved for customers who are drinking only (no food, in other words). And to look for a vomitorium in the bathrooms (!). When I'm traveling, I'm tripped up by the &quot;ordinary&quot; things I didn't know -- so this sort of information is reassuring. (Why do none of the guide books tell you that &quot;Ausfart&quot; is the word for &quot;car exit&quot; on the autobahn? As a friend of ours said, &quot;The first time I saw all those Ausfart signs, I thought, 'Wow, this is a really big city!'&quot; Ausgang, by the way, is the word for *people*-exit, a helpful item to know when you're in an underground parking garage, looking for the way out.)<br />Also, Steves is better at orientation than most. I think his is the only book that says you can get tickets ahead of time for the big Bavarian castles, so you don't spend time waiting in line. That sort of stuff is incredibly useful.<br />On the other hand... his priorities and taste do not coincide with mine. As another reviewer pointed out, Steves gives you the itinerary *he* thinks you should follow, and ignores or disparages other destinations. Maybe he thinks that Triberg is a tourist trap, but I spent 3 days in the area (in Hornberg, a few miles north) and I thought it was both a lovely town and a great base of operations for Black Forest exploration.<br />What finally turned me off was realizing how differently he travels than we do. (There. That doesn't seem so negative.) Steves gives a one-day itinerary through the Black Forest, starting in Frieburg and ending in Baden-Baden. To accomplish that, he has you zoom through the Clock Musuem in an hour (we spent two, though maybe it could have been less), and 1.5 hours at the Volksbaurnhof in Gutach. That's way too little time; we spent 3 or 4 hours there on two trips (obviously, we liked the place). Yes, in an hour and a half you can walk around this open-air museum, but you won't have time to watch one of the demonstrations, or read more than a few expanatory signs. If I followed his itinerary, I'd be skimming the surface of every destination rather than experiencing the place.<br />I own several guidebooks to Germany. It's probably worth looking through this one, especially if you happen to be planning to visit the sights he says are worthwhile. But it's far from a complete guide to the country, and you're stuck relying on HIS opinions -- which may or may not agree with yours.

Every city and state in the U.S. has a map book like this: the complete guide with EVERY road on it, 3 miles to the inch. This is the German equivalent and it's equally comprehensive. You get a full map of the entire country (even the eensy towns), and a little bit of helpful slop into France, where the countries border (i.e. they don't suddenly blank out the next-door country as do some U.S.-Canada maps). It's big and readable with useful color coding, scenic routes highlighted, and city maps for 28 towns and 19 districts.<br />There isn't much text in a book like this, but you'll be reassured to know that the extensive map legend is in English as well as German, French, and Italian.<br />It is not, however, a map book to drag along for your next vacation (unless it's measured in months). The book is huge (12&quot;x18&quot;, more than will fit in a carry-on bag for sure), and must weigh 7 or 8 pounds.	2004-05-08

First, you should know that I'm far from a wine expert. I'm working hard to get past the &quot;I just know I like this one&quot; stage, reaching towards the state of &quot;somewhat knowledgeable.&quot; Books like this are helping me achieve that goal, however.<br />The Wines of Germany is essentially organized in two parts. The first five chapters give an overview of the unique issues of the German wine landscape, covering the wine law of Germany; vineyard classification; German wine styles; going to market; and the German grape varieties.<br />The rest of the book is devoted to wines from each region, covering both the obvious regions (such as Rheingau and Nahe) and the regions that other dismiss in a few paragraphs (such as Sachsen and Saale-Unstrut). In each of those chapters, he begins with an overview that discusses everything from the hectares devoted to winemaking (&quot;The Rheingau has about 3,200 ha of vines, grown by 1,500 owners&quot;) to the geology to wine-growing history to the current market conditions. For each region, Brook discusses both individual vineyards and the producers. In other words, you can look up a wine by the village it comes from, and by a particular winery. (Some wineries, after all, have vines in more than one area.) Oh -- and there are excellent maps.<br />That sounds EVER so dry, but gosh -- it really isn't. What Brook does amazingly well is both explain what the issue is (such as the 1971 wine law), what it means to the winemakers and thus to the consumer, and how it'll affect the wines you buy (and their cost). Nor does he shy away from the politicial issues.I finally understand why the German wine labels are so confusing, for example, and why it took an entire chapter to make it understandable!<br />He's also immensely entertaining, and extremely opinionated, both about the wines and their producers, and the larger issues surrounding them. For example, he says, &quot;Baden wines and Baden wine marketing are, in short, a bit of a mess. No one is particularly motivated to sort it out. Individualist growers simply go their own way and trust in the quality of their wines to secure a share of the market.&quot;<br />But what about the wine ratings? After all, that's probably why you're considering buying this book. He gives great, pages-long coverage to the most visible of the wineries, the ones most likely to be imported to the U.S. (such as Prum and Dr Loosen), but don't expect a bottle-by-bottle rating. For instance, he says of Dr Loosen, &quot;...the Wehlener Sonnenuhr is invariably racy and zesty and delicate, as it should be, whereas the Urziger Wurzgarten is more spicy...&quot; He does mention vintages, but usually in regard to the region rather than an individual producer. But if you want to compare his opinion to yours, for a bottle you just brought home from the store, you may be disappointed; several sites and wineries get only a paragraph or so. On the other hand, with a book this complete, at least you can be reasonably sure that your bottle, no matter how obscure, will be mentioned.<br />What you *won't* find here is any kind of travel guide for visiting wineries. If that's any part of your goal, you'll also want to pick up a copy of A Traveller's Wine Guide to Germany. (I suppose it's dated, now, but it's far better as a tool for exploring the wine regions.)<br />Overall, I've found this the best book on German wines around. Well worth the money.a mess.

I recall sniffing at it: the hotels it listed were all the expensive, elegant places that I couldn't afford. And there was something about the itineraries that bothered me -- perhaps an emphasis on elegance (presumably at the expense of experiencing the real country).<br />However, during my vacation, we found ourselves following much of the Black Forest itinerary that the (then-current) book suggested, and discovered that one of the hotels we picked -- a lovely one in Triberg -- was on her list.<br />I've now been to Germany twice, and am planning a third trip. I've looked at this guide once more, and (now that I'm familar with the country) I am incredibly impressed by it. My initial criticisms, four years ago, were completely off the mark. I've done at least part of a few of her itineraries, and they really are very good.<br />While it's recommended that you stay a day or two in the major cities (such as Munich), these really get only an arm wave. (You'll want another book that focuses on them.) Where this book shines is in sending you -- in a car, this isn't for the train traveler -- along a well defined route to see stuff outside the litany of museums and yet-another-church.<br />In addition, those itineraries take  you through regions that other books simply ignore. I've found that several books completely ignore the Black Forest, or briefly mention Frieberg and Baden-Baden. The DK book (which does have beautiful pictures) gives a single page to Baden-Baden, for instance; this one has three or four, including some idea of what to expect at the famous spas.<br />Plus, unlike a lot of guide books, this one gives you some idea of how much time to budget for each leg of the trip. For instance, she points out that it's a 5-hour drive from point-a to point-b along this stretch of the Alpine Road, but between lunch and sightseeing you should expect to stay a full day.<br />The only earlier criticism that did apply -- an emphasis on expensive places to stay -- has been addressed, as there are now several places listed for 80 euros rather than 200.<br />I now have quite a collection of Germany tour books. This one's sure to be among the ones I pack along.u should expect to stay a full day.<br />The only earlier criticism that did apply -- an emphasis on expensive places to stay -- has been addressed, as there are now several places listed for 80 euros rather than 200.<br />I now have quite a collection of Germany tour books.

I knew how much it had helped us, when our mostly-Maine Coon cat grew old, to know that the breed suffered from lower back problems. We made adjustments in his lifestyle, which must have worked; the Maine Coon lived to nearly 19.<br />This was the only book I found that offered more than a couple of paragraphs about the Selkirk Rex (like the LaPerm, it's a relatively new breed); even so, most of the information here is about the Cornish Rex and the Devon Rex. That is, when it's about the Rex at all. Fully half the 100-page-or-so book is generic information about taking care of your cat, such as choosing a vet, feeding, and the declawing question. That's not necessarily bad, for those who haven't owned a cat before, and the book is cheap enough that I don't resent the &quot;extra&quot; information.<br />On the other hand, the information specific to the Rex (and to the Selkirk in particular) is good enough to shoot the review up to 4 stars.<br />First, it has incredibly pretty pictures of each of the Rex breeds, lots of them. If you want to compare your new (or proposed) kitty the best-of-the-breed, you'll have plenty of opportunity to do so. That might make it worth the money right there.<br />The authors trace the history of each breed, but more importantly they give plenty of information about the cats' temperment (these are all extremely social cats, and now I know that our kitten's insatiable curiousity will outlast kittenhood) and unique needs. For example, I'm strongly advised to pat-dry Meriwether after a bath (which is recommended once a month), rather than rub his fur dry, because that'll develop mats. It doesn't answer everything (is it just Meri, or are Selkirks all not-jumpers?) but that would be too much to ask for.<br />I've found some of this information on my Internet searches, but not all of it. If for no other reason than the collection of &quot;ooh, isn't she pretty!&quot; photos, I'm glad I got this book.retty!&quot; photos, I'm glad I got this book.	2004-03-21

But I'm a little daunted by the amount there is to learn about the subject (especially for someone who isn't &quot;handy&quot;), and I wish I had someone sitting next to me, showing how it's supposed to be done. Of all the books I've encountered, Quilting 101 is the closest to this experience.<br />First, it doesn't assume any sewing background. It starts out with an explanation of how bobbins work, for example, rather than blithely expecting that you've been using at least the super-easy sewing patterns for years. (I'm in the latter category, but far from confident.)<br />Also, this book has the best set of photos and diagrams that I've found. Many books try to get across how to straighten your fabric, for example, but this book uses four photos to make the process clear. Some of the pictures are a little *too* small (I'm still trying to figure out if I understand how to do a binding, and peering at the photo doesn't help much), but this is far better than I've seen elsewhere.<br />Finally, I really appreciate the gradient of the projects presented.  After a section that shows you each of the quilt-making steps, you start out with a hot pad and a an appliqued zippered bag -- not a lap quilt. You work your way up to checkerboard placemats and a table runner before you take on a flannel lap quilt. (I kept looking for placemat instructions, figuring that I'd rather make my really dumb mistakes on very small projects. This is the first book I found that had them.)<br />There may be better books out there; you can certainly find a lot of them with 'quilting for beginners' labels. But this one has finally gotten me almost all the way through my first quilting project. (I expect to finish this weekend. Wish me luck with that binding.)	2004-02-28

Their spines are more than a bit worn, because I've read them each several times. They're long out of print, though, so I'll review the series here.<br />These three novels all take place in the same world, in events that occur 500  years apart from one another. The stories are separate, though there are well-presented references to the earlier time. (One character in the first book, who's about 10 years old at the time, is remembered 500 years later as being a Great One.)<br />But what held me, and what keeps me re-reading these stories, was the worldbuilding, which I suspect was the largest contribution by C.J. Cherryh. There is magic -- but magic consists only of ill-wishing or well-wishing, nothing more. How much can people do with that? And how much will that affect the (inevitable?) evoluation of mechanics and science? These three authors do a good job at exploring those questions.<br />The first two books are especially satisfying, with strong characters that I quickly grew to care about. The third, by Mercedes Lackey, was... somehow unsatisfying. Acceptable tale-telling, but no more than 3 stars for that one. (To be fair, I've never been a big fan of Lackey's works, so take that with a grain of salt. If you like her stuff, you'll probably like this, too.)<br />I've often wished for a fourth and fifth book in this series. As is the case for the best SF/F books, the world came alive for me.	2004-02-04

In addition to an organized overview of the breeds, the text is downright funny. And the info is useful; for example, the author identifies the vocalization each cat has, so you don't get a talker if you prefer a quiet house, and points out the health problems to watch out for.	2004-01-21

It's similar (and fortunately doesn't rehash the same recipes, as I've seen them do in other collections), but I'm not sure these recipes will pry me away from my old favorites.<br />As with most Williams Sonoma cookbooks, there aren't a lot of recipes, but they're beautifully and appealingly photographed. The methodology is simple, which is particularly appreciated for side dishes (since your attention will probably be on fussing with the preparations for the main course).<br />Only seven of the recipes are for entrees, among them a butternut squash risotto, spanish omelet of potato, pepper and tomato, and veggie stir-fry with tofu. If you're a vegan, you probably have recipes for such things already (though these look pretty good - I haven't tried them). The book's strength is clearly as a &quot;what shall we have with the roast?&quot; solution, and it does a good job at answering that question. Organized by season, it offers both the obvious choices (simple sauteed eggplant, or fresh peas with mint) and more elaborate concoctions (jerusalem artichoke gratin, or shallots in red wine sauce).<br />Quite a few of these recipes look good (the shallots in red wine, in particular), but I don't think this book will cause me to shove my old On The Side to the back corner of the cookbook rack.	2004-01-11

There aren't all that many recipes -- perhaps 40 or 50? -- and few of them sound like a terrifically exciting and different thing to cook. Yet, the book flips open to three or four of its recipes without effort, and a few are on my Thanksgiving standards list -- the &quot;oh, you *have* to make your cranberry chutney again!&quot; no-brainers.<br />The recipes are simple without being stupid... only a little more involved than steaming that asparagus (make the &quot;asparagus with caper and pine nuts, with shaved parmesan&quot; instead, with not a whole lot more effort), or boiling carrots (the glazed carrots with marsala and hazelnuts recipe takes the dull veggie to new heights). Befitting the book title, you won't find a veggie main course here; they're all accompaniments.<br />Few, if any of the recipes, use chicken stock, so the book is suitable for vegans.<br />Not all the recipes are winners -- the baked ratatouille is pretty dull -- but the book's inexpensive enough to keep for its several winners.	2004-01-11

At that price, it had better be awesome.<br />Fortunately, Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini delivers... and then some.<br />If you're interested in non-mundane foods, particularly &quot;ethnic&quot; foods, then you've probably had the same experience I have. You find an odd looking vegetable in the grocery store, and are intruigued. You pick it up, and contemplate bringing it home. And then you realize that you have absolutely *no* idea what you'd do with one of these (other than think, &quot;I'm sure I read about bitter melons or chayote *some*place). So you sadly put the veggie back on the shelf, feeling as though you've missed out.<br />VfAtZ is a perfect answer to this dilemma. In this fat book (you could squash a *huge* spider with this tome), the author goes through all the &quot;interesting&quot; veggies with a predictable and welcome formula. There's a clear photo of the item, usually with some indication of size and with a &quot;cutaway&quot; so you know what the thing looks like once you chop it open. The author explains what the vegetable is (genus and all that jazz); where it came from (i.e. originally from South America, but now most popular in Asia); the varieties you can expect to find and the differences between them. I very much appreciate her clear instructions about choosing the vegetable in the market (i.e. heavy for its size, and no black marks on it), and the &quot;basic&quot; method of cooking (boiling, steaming, etc.) There's always at least a few recipes that highlight the essential tomatillo-ness or chayote-hood or whatever, plus a &quot;Pros Propose&quot; section where she gives you recipes from chefs and other cookbooks.  (The latter are intentionally vague -- &quot;he grills tomatillos with garlic and onlon&quot; without indication of quantities -- presumably for copyright reasons. You get the idea anyway.)<br />In short, after reading one of her 3-4 page entries for each vegetable (they're much longer for some items, such as the range of squash and mushrooms), you can confidently stand in the grocery store looking at the aforementioned veggie and Know What To Do With It.<br />Other reviewers criticize the book for not including EVERY vegetable (I admit I'd like more, but only because I'd enjoy anything this author wrote), and that the recipes aren't all that great. They're generally okay, but I admit that few of them are awesome. But I see the recipes as an exercise in learning about the vegetable rather than a source of &quot;what to have for dinner.&quot; I often reach for this book because some other cookbook was too vague.<br />Case in point: a recipe in another cookbook for a Sichuan hotpot suggested you could cook sliced lotus root in the hotpot. I dutifully picked up a lotus root at the Asian market. When I got it home, I had no idea how one slices it -- do I peel it first? What about these knobby chunks? I grabbed Schneider's book off the shelf, and five minutes later I knew just what to do. (It tasted darned good, too.)<br />I don't grab for this book when I'm trying to figure out what to make for dinner.

By any standard of fiction, this is not a great novel, and it may sour you on Heinlein's later work. Reading _For Us, The Living_ will be like looking at your favorite beautiful actress before she's put on makeup, possibly after a very bad night of drinking.  (Yours *or* hers.)<br />However, for one group of people this book is a no-brainer: anyone who's a budding author. Or creative artist of any nature, I suspect. The lack of &quot;makeup&quot; is itself instructive, because you see how he put it on; the book shows the artist's work before he honed and finished it.<br />This was the novel Heinlein wrote before he submitted &quot;Lifeline&quot; (his first short story), two years later; two years after that (according to Spider Robinson's introduction), Heinlein was guest of honor at the Denver SF WorldCon. FUTL demonstrates how much even a master has to learn -- and what's really astonishing is how fast Heinlein learned it. (Four years from this to the WorldCon?!)<br />If you're a writer, FUTL will reassure you that it's possible for a bad writer to get better. You'll also cheer at the points where the &quot;real&quot; Heinlein comes through (amusingly enough, the brightest moments of his voice show up in describing what a cat does - go figure).

Not just &quot;emmenthaler with riesling&quot; match-ups (though that's there, for us give-me-the-answer simpletons), but educational guidance about how to *think* about the subject: &quot;...red wine will often seem bitter when sipped with many cheeses, because the tannins in red wine are exacerbated by salt and umami. Many cheeses have a good amount of discernable salt, which brings the tannin to the fore.&quot; It certainly helped me a lot.<br />But if you *still* don't want to think about it, each of the recipes has a wine recommendation.<br />I've only tried one recipe so far, which was excellent: a carmelized onion, bacon, and gruyere fondue. The instructions are relatively simple and easy to follow; no complaints there. In general, the recipes are expansions on the familiar without being too much of a stretch for relatives who don't like &quot;weird stuff,&quot; such as cheddar-parmesan crackers, or cherry tomatoes with herbed goat cheese and shrimp. Unfortunately for me, a seemingly high percentage of the recipes use goat cheese -- and we don't LIKE goat cheese in my household. (There would be much screaming if I even tried to serve it.) There's also a tropism towards appetizers and a &quot;cheese plate&quot; rather than full-blown entrees; not that those are bad, but you should know what to expect.<br />The cheesemaking and winemaker profiles are interesting, in a read-once sort of way. While I like browsing through the book with the profiles interspersed with the recipes, when I'm actually looking for a recipe they get in the way. But I'll forgive this easily, because the photos (for both profiles and food) are simply gorgeous.<br />You'll enjoy browsing through this book. You'll probably find a few recipes to make again and again. (There's already a bookmark stuck into that fondue recipe.) But I'm not sure this will land in your dog-eared pile.us.<br />You'll enjoy browsing through this book. You'll probably find a few recipes to make again and again.

I love historical fiction, especially when it's well researched. The premise of this book is excellent: a modern woman is sent back in time, and must cope with the day-to-day details in that era. How could this go wrong?<br />But wrong it goes. I never did believe in the heroine. I find it hard to imagine that a woman could make it through law school and be *that* ignorant of history, from the long existence of slavery to the danger of drinking untreated water. I kept being thrown out of the story because I thought the heroine was such an idiot.<br />Maybe the authors could have gotten away with it (there *are* dumb heroines, who eventually wise up) if the storytelling were stronger or the facts presented were inherently more interesting (or at least new to me). However, it's as though the authors wanted to shove a bunch of research at the reader... and the exposition isn't interesting enough to warrant that.<br />Both Tarr and Turtledove have written far stronger books. If you like their work, choose another novel instead. If you're interested in stories that take place in the Roman era, I'd recommend any of the Steven Saylor &quot;Gordianas The Finder&quot; mysteries, which give a much better (and more riveting) view.	2003-12-08
US	53079248	R1SY1KFQLVL12N	1580084885	549221973	Caprial and John's Kitchen	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Lovely book, with &quot;fancy&quot; recipes that are also do-able	As the Amazon description accurately says, the majority of this book is a set of 50 entrees with side dishes. Each of them is appealing, with straightforward instructions (though a few annoying spots where you need to turn the page to see what the next step is). The recipes are &quot;homestyle&quot; without being ordinary, such as osso buco braised with mint and tomatoes (mint? in osso bucco? yeah, that could work!) accompanied by green beans with balsamic vinegar. Quite a few recipes are vegetarian, though not enough that I'd be comfortable giving the book to a vegetarian.<br />Each dinner -- which serves 4 to 6 -- has steps for what one partner can do (sear and braise the veal shanks) while the other one works on another part of the recipe (prep the vegetables for the braising liquid). While this might be helpful to less experienced couples (say, newlyweds, or a couple that's new to the two-cooks-in-the-kitchen dance), I find it more cute than useful.<br />My only beef with the cookbook is that it has a tendency to use ingredients that cost a bundle, at least if you're outside the Pacific Northwest. Several recipes use chantarelles and other wild mushrooms, for example, which I love but can't afford often. As a result, these recipes may be used more for &quot;special occasions&quot; than for ordinary suppers.<br />But they'll be used. There's no doubt of that. Ordinarily, when I get a new cookbook I find a half dozen things I'm anxious to try immediately; this time, I have at least twice that many that I'm ready to try.	2003-12-02

If you start reading Kage Baker's first fantasy novel, The Anvil of the World, you may wonder why the book is so highly rated. That's because the weakest part is the first section. Perhaps it's because so many of the characters have something to hide, or at least some unspoken backstory that Baker feels she must reveal bit by bit, but it took me quite a while to warm up to the tale. In fact, she has so much to hold back about the main character, Smith, that she writes about him almost at arm's length, and I didn't really care what happened to the guy.<br />You might not, either, because the tone in the first part isn't especially smooth (at least compared to Baker's other works, nearly all of which I adore), and it wasn't until the second part (I should really call them several related novellas) that it finally hit me that, Oh! She's being *funny*! I was taking it all seriously, with perhaps a bit of lighthearted commentary. (I bet it'd all be a lot better on a second read. Or you might not have this problem, since you've been warned.)<br />But do bear with that rocky start, because once Baker finds her stride, she immediately proves why so many of her books earn 5-star ratings. While showing us the adventures of one Smith, an ex-assassin who's looking for a better life, she creates a believeable world with distinct races and plenty of conflict to cope with. Her portrayal of demons as, to some degree, technology indistinguishable from magic, is nothing short of great. And the book might be worthwhile for the Fatally Verbal Abuse duel.<br />Do read it. And if it seems hard going to begin with, plod on through. It gets better. LOTS better.	2003-10-04
US	53079248	R2O2MVKIPRVZGG	0609600001	223818543	The French Vineyard Table	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A delightful cookbook -- even if you don't intend to cook	This is one of the prettiest cookbooks I've come across in years. Organized by wine region, it presents both photos and recipes for Burgandy, Provence, etc. The recipes are well presented, with clear explanations of unusual or hard to find ingredients (such as Bresse chickens or wild mushrooms) and they suggest subsitutions that don't make me feel as though I'll be using Velveeta cheese when only Emmenthaler will do.<br />The recipes look scrumptious -- though I haven't tried to make any of them yet -- and each uses the regional wines. A few of the dishes seem a little _too_ precious  (I can't see myself making a blanquette of frog's legs with cepes and gros plante wine, though I might order it in a restaurant). And others are unlikely: I'm not going to afford truffles anytime soon, but you'll find at least a half dozen recipes using them. That isn't a problem, though: several recipes are unpretentious and are begging to be made into Sunday dinner: fricassee of free-range chicken with roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms (not to mention 2 cups of Chardonnay), or lemon scallops with tomato and white wine (this time the author recommends one from Gaillac). It's a little heavy on the fish and fowl, with only a few beef, veal or pork dishes, in case that's an issue for you.<br />However, this book is worth it even if you don't cook a thing, because the photography is absolutely stunning. In addition to excellent food photography (most of the recipes are accompanied with a photo, which I appreciate), there's stunning photos of each French region, mostly of vineyards and other foodie issues (such as a photo of a prize winning Bresse chicken). But you'll get your quota of castles and rural French vistas, too, making this a worth book to look at even if you're simply considering a vacation in France.	2003-09-12
US	53079248	R39LLDU0GBIXQT	0836227255	395437998	The Hungry Traveler Germany (The Hungry Traveler Series)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Should be in any foodie's backpack on a trip to Germany	I may know the names of typical German dishes, but that doesn't help me decipher a menu when I'm visiting a restaurant in Germany. With a limited amount of time (and thus a finite opportunity to pig out on regional specialties), I wanted to make sure I was picking the best stuff to eat.<br />We took this slender tome with us on our last trip, and we were extremely glad we did. What's this dessert prepared with Muskatnuss? Ah, nutmeg! How do I ask for a hard-boiled egg at breakfast? (If you don't specify, I learned, you get it soft-boiled.) And so on.<br />We definitely had fewer surprises. And we able to order what we really wanted. The book also includes a section on regional specialties, so we knew enough to order Maultaschen when we had the opportunity to do so, not to mention an idea of what would arrive on the plate.<br />In addition to the Hungry Traveler Germany, I also have the Marling Menu-Master Germany (which appears to be out of print, alas).  Both are very good, earning 5-stars unquestionably, though this book is a bit larger (and thus may be awkward to carry; it fits okay in a fanny pack). If I had to choose, I'd take the Marling book with me on a trip, because it's organized by restaurant menu sections, rather than alphabetically. It's also small enough to fit in a pocket.<br />This one, though, has little extras that make it worth reading all the way through. For example, it warns you not to try to bring back any meat products (which I should have read before trying to bring home Black Forest Ham), and suggests made-in-Germany food related specialties that won't bother Customs at all (ranging from Christmas gingerbread to cutlery and table linens).	2003-08-16

Maybe it's because I never imagined myself as a recycled Hemingway, Bob Woodward, or Mark Twain; I've always written like myself. However, I found the first section awfully tedious. The author keeps knocking you over the head with the reasons to find your OWN voice rather than write like an ersatz Big Name Author. Enough already, I got the point. The reader probably doesn't need to be convinced, if she's already picked up this book.<br />If I'd stopped after the first third of the book (and I was tempted to, I confess), this review would have gotten only 2 or 3 stars.<br />Edgerton makes up for it, though, when he gets specific. Fortunately,  he does so often, with plenty of examples that show how to _use_ the rules you're read in other books. For example, instead of just saying that you shouldn't talk down to the reader, he provides the intro to one of his own short stories, then rewrites it with all the backstory that a less-experienced writer would be tempted to add. It works, because even the backstory-filled excerpt doesn't completely ... I found that compare-and-contrast analysis very helpful, and you probably will, too. (He has examples from plenty of writers, with all kinds of styles. Not just his own stuff, though he's certainly a good storyteller.)<br />The author also includes several exercises to help you \\"find your voice.\\" I didn't feel that most of the exercises were necessary, but one intrigued me: identify the weakest part of your writing (plot, dialog, description, etc.), read several examples of that writing aspect done well, then write a \\"report\\" as if you were writing a college paper. I'm not sure if doing exercises like this will work for you -- they don't do much for me, since I usually have paying articles to write instead -- but his are certainly better than the typical [boring]ones.<br />Another strength is that Edgerton doesn't write only for fiction authors. I'm a non-fiction author and editor by trade (primarily articles but also some books) and much of his \\"voice\\" advice is helpful.<br />Finding Your Voice did sensitize me to several issues of writer voice, and at the end of the book I felt I'd learned something useful. I don't think that I'd put this book on a writer's Must Read shelf, but I'm glad I invested the time in reading it.s.<br />Another strength is that Edgerton doesn't write only for fiction authors.

I don't want to know EVERYTHING about this topic, but I wanted to get some grounding in it.<br />This book was a perfect solution. It covers the &quot;investigations&quot; (or more commonly looting) of the Egyptian treasures, starting with Herodotus and ending, pretty much, with Petrie. (I was surprised that it didn't follow the history to Carter.)<br />The author manages to explain what each era was like, describing both what an individual (such as Belzoni or Petrie) did, the conditions in which the events occured, and why it was important. He also writes with humor and a steady non-judgemental hand -- pointing out what the detractors said (then and now) as well as the supporters' view.<br />It's not all fascinating stuff; there were some subjects that didn't hold my interest, but I didn't mind flipping over them.<br />The pictures are all in black and white, but they're all interesting and they illuminate the people as well as the places.<br />It was certainly enjoyable reading for a subject amateur like myself.	2003-05-27

(Plus, we really like Pigott's other book on German wine, which is now regrettably out of print.)<br />There's many things to like about this book, even if you aren't a wine snob. (I'm far from knowledgeable -- I simply like German wine, so I want a guide that'll tell me how to use my time and taste buds wisely.)<br />The book is organized into geographies, such as \\"Kaiserstuhl and Tuniberg\\" or \\"Ortenau.\\" Each section describes the overall characteristics of the area. (\\"Whichever the soil type, the Pinot family of grapes accounts for a good two thirds of all plantings.\\") It also provides a list of recommended producers, hotels and restaurants, and places of interest. These descriptions are very short, usually a single paragraph, so don't assume you can get away without a regular guide book as well. The pictures are lovely, too, assuming that you're the kind of person who likes to look at photos of vineyards.<br />The reviews don't pull their punches, and they give a sense of each place's value (\\"Excellent meat dishes and good ocean fish... fairly expensive food; moderately priced rooms\\") so you know what you're getting into. I don't think I happened to visit any of the recommended hotels or restaurants, so I can't tell you how accurate they are.<br />However, the irksome part of the book is its brevity when the details matter.  Perhaps I'm used to having my hand held more than they think I need. When we wanted to find a winery that was listed, we had no idea where to look on the regional map. (Germany has a lot of *tiny* towns.) Nor did I have any idea what to expect in regard to wine tasting customs. Accustomed to the well-marked signs in northern California, I was surprised by how much I had to search for the wine tasting room for the recommended co-op I'd chosen. (It was definitely worth the quest, however.)<br />I like this book quite a bit, though I think it's a good title to read before you go rather than to take along./>I like this book quite a bit, though I think it's a good title to read before you go rather than to take along.	2003-05-25

It's just not that much of a COOKbook	The description makes it sound as though this book is chock full of recipes from this very-old, very-beloved restaurant. But note carefully that it says 30 recipes. These are good recipes, without doubt. While I haven't tried them yet, they seem to be excellent instructions for the most old-standard of established San Francisco cooking, from sand dabs to cioppino. But 30 recipes isn't a lot, and you won't find anything very surprising. Get the best quality stuff and cook it simply -- that seems to be the Tadich Grill's key to success.<br />More than making me want to cook, however, this book makes me want to hop on a plane to the coast and rush over to the restaurant. It's more a history of the Tadich Grill, in the context of the history of San Francisco -- a foodie's guide to the City. And in that regard it succeeds very well. If you're curious how San Francisco restaurants came to be dominated by Croats, or you're interested in the culture that creates such a long standing institution, you'll enjoy this book. I'm not sure whether it's worth a full-scale investment to put it on your shelf (I took the book out of the library), but it's certainly an enjoyable read.<br />Now, let's see if there are any airline specials for San Francisco right now... I'm hungry!	2003-01-28
US	53079248	RA0ASZ9O1UQMJ	0441873804	400678812	Water Witch	Books	4	24	24	N	N	A perfect airline book	Water Witch isn't big literature, but it provides an enjoyable few hours in another universe. Initially, the book gives you the impression that this will be fluffy entertainment, but it delivers much more. You bite into cotton candy and find, say, a lemon meringue pie. Just a *little* more depth than you'd expected.<br />The story is fairly simple, but it would be easy to spoil the plot; forgive me if I'm circumspect. Basically, Water Witch takes place on a planet, long since settled by humans, where water is rare; only a water witch -- someone who's genetically sensitive to water and can feel its presence -- can control the precious resource. However, of the water witches have died out and the current princess, as you learn in the first few pages, doesn't have very much talent. Despite the short-of-water theme, it's definitely not a Dune knockoff, as the alien planet has several well thought out ecological resources.<br />The story is told from two viewpoints: Deza, the daughter of a con man, and Radi, who's engaged to the last princess of the Red City. Naturally the whole thing is a setup for a love story, and it doesn't disappoint.<br />All of the above makes this sound like a very serious novel, but it's a done with a light hand and a sense of humor. The humor of real people rather than silliness or laugh-out-loud escapades.<br />While the story doesn't have the interwoven zanyness that Willis accomplishes so well in her later work (which always makes me think of Katherine Hepburn movies like Bringing Up Baby), it does show signs of her development. The authors do a fine job of storytelling (sometimes you can tell whose hand was on the keyboard, so to speak, but it's rare), with more complex characters than in at least another one of their collaborations.<br />I enjoyed this book, and think it'd be a fine accompaniment on a long trip.	2002-12-10

This one is unique, because it collects a set of recipes you *wouldn't* have thought up on your own.<br />For instance, it's the only book in which I've found a recipe for goldenrod eggs (hard boiled eggs in a cream sauce, served over toast, with grated egg yolks and paprika sprinkled on top) except for a 1942 WWII-era pamphlet my mom had. It's the only recipe I've found for dutch baby pancakes -- sort of a cross between a pancake and a sweetened popover, traditionally served with lemon and maybe a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar.<br />Aside from completeness, the recipes are clearly written, entertaining (with sidebars that include breakfast menus from, say, a 1904 hotel menu), and educational.<br />I have at least three or four breakfast cookbooks. This is the only one I use regularly.	2002-12-01

There's a reason for that. This is the kind of book that people borrow, but never want to part with again.<br />A lot of consulting books are filled with fluff, common sense advice that you already know, or only ONE good thought in 250 pages. In 17 years of consulting, however, I've never found a better guide to solving the REAL business problems that you'll encounter. (And it's useful for more than just consultants, too.) Weinberg gets his message across in simple, memorable anecdotes that I can recite perfectly, fifteen years after I first read the book: The Orange Juice Rule, Rudy's Rutabaga Rule.<br />Here's one fer-instance. A client says that he wants something special done in a project you've already budgeted and possibly already started. Do you tell her \\"no way!\\" and lose the business? Do you do the extra work, grumbling about it (and maybe losing money on the deal)? Or do you apply the Orange Juice Rule? (You don't think I'll give away the answer, do ya?) I can't tell you how often I've applied the Orange Juice Rule and saved my business relationship as well as my own budget.<br />Besides, this book is just plain fun to read.

It's certainly that, but I'd be tempted to recommend this book even if you're so-so about wine.<br />That's because this travel book is straightforward and honest in its opinions; it says that the view from a restaurant is excellent but the food is only so-so, or just stick to their fish entrees. As a result, when the book does gush you know that it's sincerely meant, not an unrelenting PR spin about the expected tourist stops.<br />The book isn't perfect, however. One thing it lacks (as do most other Germany guide books) is any sense of distance between places; an occasional &quot;only a 20-minute drive away&quot; would have helped immeasurably.<br />We all have a limited amount of time available on our vacations; this book helped us use that time wisely.	2002-01-15

This book was an excellent tool for planning our trip -- the photos are beautiful, and the tour layout helped us figure out where we should go and what might be worth seeing. Its short descriptions of each stop helped us grasp what a place was about, and as a result we budgeted about the right amount of time for each stop.<br />As a tour book to take along, though, it's not nearly as helpful. On the plus side, it's the only book I encountered that imagines you might actually be *driving* through Germany (the rest of them start describing a city beginning with the train station, with no clue for car drivers on how to get downtown). Also, most of the other books don't quite grasp that you might explore outside the big cities; this one does just the opposite, which I appreciated. However, the directions from place to place are a bit sparse, and it provides almost no useful information about lodging or dining.<br />This is a good guide book. But don't let it be the only one you carry.	2000-10-22

It took me years to realize just how much I'd learned from it, although even at the time I would have told you it has the highest density of epiphanies-per-page I've encountered in any business book. His \\"orange juice rule\\" has helped me to do and say the RIGHT thing... wow, I couldn't even estimate how often.<br /><br />I've looked at a lot of consulting books. This is the one I keep coming back to.	1997-07-13
