Dick Lyles has done it again, proving he truly is one of the top parable writers of our time!  The purpose of a parable is to reveal universal and timeless truths through stories and characters that capture the reader's imagination.  WINNING HABITS presents  a thoroughly enjoyable story with truths that are especially relevant to our generation.  Although some readers may feel as though they've heard some of these lessons before (that's often the way it is with universal truths), a fun and interesting reminder presented in this easy-to-read format will benefit all.  In my opinion, we simply don't get enough of this kind of reinforcement in the hectic, high-pressure world we work in today.  <BR>To combat this pressure our team got together and ordered copies for everyone on our team.  We're also giving them as gifts for valued customers and vendors.  It's a great way to nurture our relationships on a positive footing.  The outcome is that we often talk and kid each other about the habits in a way that helps build meaningful comraderie.  <BR>I highly recommend this book to anyone but especially to people who, like the main character Albert, are early in their careers and looking for ways to develop a competitive edge.  I've personally seen the difference these secrets make and know from experience they can help everybody.	2004-01-19

The Devil Wears Prada is a great escape and a thoroughly entertaining read with one of a kind characters and dishy insight into the fashion industry.  It really had some great lessons about priorities as well as being a juicy little page turner.  Great stitting by the pool, traveling on long flights type of book.  By the way, the \\"reader\\" who wrote the one star \\"hackneyed, boring and ungrammatical\\" review obviously didn't bother to actually read the book because the heroine's name is Andrea, not Alex.

I bought this book with the great expectation that wonderful memories from my growing up years would send me down nostalgia lane. There was abosolutely no similarity to the Pueblo I know and remember in the novel.With the exception of a few familiar names like Gast the characters were far different from the people I knew well. The Gast's were neighbors of mine. They were well respected in the community and beloved by all who knew them. Julavits depicts Pueblo as being in the dust bowl. In the 55 years that I lived there, I do not recall one single dust storm as she described. I guess if you are going to write fiction, you may as well make everything up. <br />The story itself was difficult to follow because her style of dreamy surreality was boring. The plot was weak and the storyline odd and very depressing. Sorry Miss Julavits, your first attempt was a stinker.	2001-02-19

She was too psychotic to appreciate.  By the time Huston started revealing information about Saffie's past I had already formed a picture of a heartless nutcase and I found it hard to sympathize with Saffie.  Furthermore, I thought that Andras was a down to earth, sensible, young buck and I found it hard to believe that he would ever fall for a weirdo like Saffie.  There was also this whole notion of love at first sight - gimme a break.  When Andras and Saffie met I felt like I was reading a category romance from the grocery store.  The only reason that I would give this book two stars instead of one was because there were many instances were Huston showed her ability as a good writer.  I really liked the little passages from the narrator and the explanation of the title.   I probably would've enjoyed the book more if Saffie hadn't been such a head case.  She could've been mildly weird but her bizarre behavior was too extreme and made her seem completely weak and heartless.	2000-10-12

We've all been dumped for another woman.  We've all made stupid decisions in relationships and we've all put ourselves in a self-defeating relationship at one point in time.  I'd love to meet the  woman who was born perfect - born with all the right ideas about love and  relationships.  Sure, I wanted to tell Robin and Savannah to stop slutting  around but it didn't make me angry or annoyed with the book.  I noticed  that many of the other reviews expressed that they became angry with the  book because of the premiscuous behavior that some of the characters were  involved in.  Those of us who have been lucky enough to realize that sex  does not equal love should applaud Terry McMillan for showing this to other  women who are behaving like Savannah and Robin.  Furthermore, for those of  us who have been in Bernadine's shoes I was so glad to see that there was  light at the end of the tunnel - that she rediscovered herself and she  rediscovered love with the RIGHT man.  A worthwhile read for ALL women.  No  matter what race or lifestyle we lead every one of us faces similar  struggles.	2000-05-02

Morgan thrusts the reader right into mountain life a century ago.  From page one I could tell that Gap Creek was going to be full of surprises.  I was glad that Julie was portrayed as a strong woman but not as some kind of  unrealisitc feminist.  Morgan made Julie human by making her hard-working  and smart but also gullible and sensitive to pleasing her husband.  It was  refreshing to read about a woman who has real feminine feelings for once.   I'm so tired of modern day literature creating liberated women who have no  human qualities.  I have to admit that three quarters of the way through  the book I began to get a little annoyed because nothing good happened to  the characters.  But as I read further I noticed a spiritual transition  take place within Julie and Hank.  No matter what happened to them they  always had their hope and the couple seemed to find peace.  Hopefully,  Morgan will write a sequel to Gap Creek. The ending leaves plenty of  possibilites for a sequel.  I would love to read more about Julie and Hank.	2000-04-24

I enjoyed the interesting tid-bits of everyday life in the nineteenth century and the  little moments of wisdom that seem to come from Allende herself.   Characters such as Mama Fresia and Miss Rose could only be created through  the mind of a genius writer.  But the problem is that Miss Rose and Mama  Fresia are not the main characters.  The main characters are less  interesting and somewhat flat.  Further flaws besome present in the second  half of the novel when Allende focuses more on redundant descriptions of  old San Franciso and less on the intriguing plot of Eliza and Jouquin.  I  found myself skipping page-legnth paragraphs (for several pages at a time)  of space filling, unnecessary descriptions about secondary characters and  the scenery.  And even after skipping these pointless descrpitions I could  return to the book and still know exactly what was going on with the plot.   Allende also makes the mistake of throwing in secondary plots such as those  involving Esther and the blacksmith that have absolutely nothing to do with  the main characters or plot.  These secondary plots seemed more like an  attempt to fill space and to compensate for the fact that the main plot  seems to thin out and weaken three quarters of the way through the novel.  Sure, the book was entertaining - a good rainy day read but it is also  predictable and at certain times it reminded me of a category romance with  a trite formula.  There is no questioning Allende's talent and skill as a  writer and at moments Daughter of Fortune reveals Allende's genius.   However the novel is not her best.  Overall, Daughter of Fortune is a  decent novel from a brilliant writer.	2000-03-31

Rather than being a boring historical account of events that occurred during the Cripple Creek gold rush this book is a first hand  experience of a young girl who actually grew up in Cripple Creek during the  gold rush.  It is filled with lots of tid-bits about what life was actually  like back then - food they ate, clothes they wore ect.  as opposed to a  bunch of historical facts.  A good read if you're interested in what life  was like in Cripple Creek.	2000-03-06

The book's value is that in a very short period of time it helps the reader get in touch with an issue  that is affecting us all at some level today - how we cope with change.   This is one of those books that everyone should read, both to learn better  how to deal with some of life's challenges, and to provide an interesting  topic of discussion for cocktail parties.  <br />Another book, just released  with a testimonial by Spencer Johnson, that falls into this same category  is WINNING WAYS: FOUR SECRETS FOR GETTING GREAT RESULTS BY WORKING WELL  WITH PEOPLE, by Dick Lyles.  Like CHEESE, it also has a foreword by Ken  Blanchard, and it also deals with an issue that affects us all at some  level.      <br />Those reviewers who say these books are over-simplified miss  their true beauty.  The reason these books by Johnson, Blanchard and Lyles  are so popular is that they highlight simple truths in ways that people can  relate to them and apply them to their personal lives for personal  betterment.  Each book doesn't have all the answers.  But then, neither do  all the big fat books I've read that are more theoretical and deal with  their subjects on a so-called \\"higher\\" intellectual plane.  <br />My fervent  hope is that people will read the works of these great authors and share  their ideas with others for two reasons.  First, so these authors will  continue to produce classics like these.  And second, because if more  people read and apply these ideas, the better our world will be.	2000-01-22

Some will work in some organizations, while others might work elsewhere.  As often happens when one tries to generate ideas in abundance, not all will  be useful.  But being able to puruse the overall landscape of opportunity  has been helpful.  <br />My concern, however, is the focus that this book  places on recognition, as opposed to results.  For a deeper treatment of  human performance in the workplace, I suggest people also read RESPONSIBLE  MANAGERS GET RESULTS: HOW THE BEST FIND SOLUTIONS, NOT EXCUSES, by Gerald  Faust and co-authors.  This provides a balance to the overall perspective  of the leader.  Because after all, the main purpose for rewarding employees  is to achieve responsible performance that leads to organizational,  bottom-line results.	1999-12-23

The question should really be, how naive do we let ourselves be?  I didn't think that it was a huge shock that Kathryn didn't know about  her husbands double life. Based on the flashbacks that Shreve provides in  every other chapter it was clear that Kathryn's marriage was falling apart  and she jsut didn't want to face the truth.  Furthermore, the novel is one  of the most predictable I've ever read.  The whole question of how real we  really know someone is a good one.  Unfortunately, it is not well presented  in this case.  The whole idea of leading a double life with another family  is trite and similar to an episode of Dynasty or All My Children.	1999-06-18

There has never been and will never be a similar story.  While the novella is essentially a story of love and survival -two of the most  common storylines in  literature - the plot is totally unique to anything  that has ever been written.  London uses his themes of survival and love  through the life of a dog, Buck.  With all of the trite storylines in  literature The Call of the Wild is refreshing to read.

Boyle is not only one of the best contemporary writers but a great writer for all time.  The Tortilla Curtain is a truly informative yet entertaining reading experience.  Even if the plot was thin (which it  isn't) the novel would keep the reader entertained with the characters  alone.  It is clear that Boyle is a not only an excellent writer but a good  psychologist as well. Judging from his characters I sensed that Boyle can  read people well.  I know several Kyra's and Delaney's, apparaently Boyle  does too.  It is refreshing to read a contemporary novelist who doesn't  need to rely on fancy or abstract writing styles and metaphors to make some  weak point or send across a subtle message.  Boyle's message is clear,  enjoyable, easy to read yet strong and greatly important.  Only a great few  can say they have mastered that.

For a writer as prestigious as Tony Morrison one would assume that she has mastered the craft of novel writing. But it is  clear that Tony Morrison still doesn't understand how to develop a strong  plot as well as a clear theme.  The story is misguided from the beginning  as Morrison jumps back and forth from the town of Ruby and the characters  of the convent.  There are a million undeveloped characters and a number of  confusing family trees.  Morrison leaves it up to the reader to follow  along with her shaky stream of consciousness, leaving the reader  overwhelmed and bored. It is obvious that Morrison has taken advantage of  her place as literary master.  She has used her popularity and prestige to  sell another book.  All I can say is that I am glad I checked this book out  at the local library instead of wasting money at the university bookstore.	1999-02-04

Have people enjoyed this &quot;novel&quot; to sound  liberated and intellectual?  Or, is Bukowski's audience merely deprived of  great literature.  Bukowski's narrator, the postal temp, nymphomaniac  alcoholic, gave me such an ill feeling that I turned the pages to see if he  could possibly redeem himself in my eyes.  His numerous encounters with  women, while they may be true to life, seemed to be void fillers within the  work.  It was as if Bukowski was trying to emmulate Allen Ginsberg with his  raw and outrageous nature.  His attempts were meager and artificial.  Mr.  Bukowski, You are no Allen Ginsberg.	1999-02-04

Lonesome  Dove was a capitaving, brilliant story, perhaps one of the best novels ever  written.  Streets of Laredo is terrible.  It is one disappointment after  another.
