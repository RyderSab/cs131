A happily-wed, previous longtime bachelor suddenly loses his wife and daughter in an accident? No problem, he instantly hooks up with a close friend and in two months is happily living a new life. Financial problems for the couple? Of course not, suddenly we find that a forgotten clock they own is suddenly worth a fortune! And they even inherit a house from a complete stranger! A teenager lives a miserable life with her mother and grandmother in London and suddenly discovers happiness? Easy! Just whisk her away with some strangers to Scotland and force the reader to suspend his disbelief into believing she would be allowed. An so on... <br /> <br />Some people will enjoy this saccharine-sweet story, but for me life simply isn't the way Pilcher portays it. For her, people are either loving or selfish, and I don't buy this. It is exasperating to read this oversimplification of the complexities of life.	2005-06-03
US	49704382	RLDLYT9WD7Q74	038533690X	695041018	Mina	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Good intentions, weak plot	Mina paints an interesting portait of the hardships of the Irish and English people during the 19th century. We read about the potato famine in Ireland, religious discrimination, and the plight many people endured just to survive. It is based on this that I respect the book. Unfortunately, the author oversimplifies the plot and the characters, so every plot direction is completely predictable.	2005-04-27
US	49704382	RP2SDLT9DC40V	0374270325	101241499	A Man in Full	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A solid, first-class pageturner	Don't be frightened by the book's length, because once you pick it up, you'll end up hooked right till the last pages. But hooked in a good sense, because this is a pageturner that provides wide social commentary on many issues such as race, the insides of corporations, social class, sex, etc. The characters are wonderfully defined and each of them is interesting in their own terms, although the most fascinating is Charlie Croker. The book has everything: frantic action and suspense (in the Conrad sections), humor, a great insight into the characters' thoughts (most notably in Martha and Ray's date) and even some philosophy thrown in. The title is appropiate as the book deals with what defines manhood in modern society. Is it wealth, social prominence, or integrity? I also enjoyed the setting; Atlanta was a city I knew nothing about and I feel the book captured its spirit. <br /> <br />Some minor quibbles: there were too many descriptions about what each character was wearing, and about such person's garden, driveway, mansion, etc. I felt they didn't add much to the story. As for the ending, it seemed a bit rushed and contrived, but it worked for me. <br /> <br />I guess the best compliment I can make about this book is I never wanted it to end!	2005-04-20
US	49704382	R33CY095J28BM0	0385491026	75368334	Cat's Eye	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Masterful writing, as usual!	Cat's Eye deals with the unconfortable subjet of childhood bullying, and the psychological wounds that it inflicts on later stages of life. The novel's main character Elaine, is a conflicted and insecure painter whose friendship with Cordelia has marked her through childhood, adolescense and adulthood. Atwood explores complex childhood issues like the difference between boys' and girls' play and the effects of having a brother, and of course, the bullying itself. This part of the novel is extremely interesting, and the writing of course, sublime. Later on we see how Elaine grows, and we see how underneath the sharp-witted girl there is the childhood angst, still there.    What can I say about the writing? Beautiful, poetic, sharp, Atwood proves once again she is the master of imagery. Another gem is the description of Elaine's paintings, with great symbolism. Highly recommended!	2005-03-14

Lessing bitterly attacks the dogmatic views on communism and justice held by leaderships which were soon forgotten when they rose to power. Instead, her heroines are women (Julia, Frances, Silvia) whose political positions are not so defined but who rise above their circumstances to provide care and support to those around them. The section set in Africa is particularly intense and vivid. On the other hand, plotwise the story meanders too much and often loses focus, specially in the 60's part. I got the feeling that the novel would have improved with better editing.	2005-01-13

The story is exciting and the book is definitely a page-turner. Also, having worked in a multinational high-tech company, I had fun with the author's description of Wyatt and Trion and laughed with the wicked descriptions of the marketing departments.

Excellent story about the rise and fall of the Ashkenazi family, which covers different historical stages like the Industrial Revolution, rise of Capitalism and Communism, World War I, etc. But above all the novel deals with the issue of the nature of the Jewish identity, and it is here where it really succeeds. Singer enforces the fact that for every hardship endured, the Jewish community always ends up being the scapegoat.<br />What also struck me is the angry and pessimistic tone that Singer employs throughout the story. Most characters are mean and selfish, inflicting continuous suffering to others. As the preface points out (at least in the Spanish edition), Singer seems to have a premonition concerning the fate of the Jewish community in the years following the novel.<br />This is a fantastic historical saga, very educational and thought-provoking.	2004-06-29

Tony, Charis and Roz are wonderfully developed, but it´s Zenia who is the real star here. I would have loved to read a chapter under her point of view, I´m sure Mrs. Atwood would have been up to the task!!! But perhaps this is the whole point, maybe Zenia was a sort of personification of the three friends´ most deepest fears and weaknesses.<br />But still, what shines here is the writing, which puts this book a notch above others with similar soap-operaish plots. This is a high-quality page-turner.	2004-02-16

Orwell manages the difficult task of successfully combining the details of trench life, the description of the turmoils in Barcelona and a comprehensible analysis of the clash of several left-wing political parties during the Spanish Civil war. He even adds some deliciously humorous remarks! And the whole thing is absolutely entertaining, vivid and interesting.<br />Really, one finishes this book and feels a deep respect for this man. It's discouraging to learn that he and so many others who had fought in the trenches had to flee the country or suffer inprisonment and even death, only due to the deep struggle for power between political forces that belonged to the same side! I was impressed by how Orwell describes the passion and idealism that prevailed during the 1930's, specially compared to the sleepy, double-standard ethics of nowadays. <br />As a Spaniard, I admit not possesing deep knowledge about the Spanish Civil War, other than some family recollections and the usual basics. This book helped me learn about the complexities of the &quot;red&quot; side and about the everyday miseries of war.<br />Highly recommended!!	2003-12-17

As important as the characters is the historical setting, which is America during the Nixon-Kennedy campaign. Faulks creates three vivid characters, each with their own motivations and weaknesses, and paints a love story that is passionate and filled with longing, but also with resignation.<br />What I liked about the book is the sense of urgency it creates and the mood it is set in. Among the main characters, Charlie is the one I felt more interesting. I also enjoyed the sections set in England when Mary's mother dies, how her feeling are wonderfully explored. Faulk´s prose is literate although sometimes he gets too wordly when he describes the characters' thoughts, rendering them unreal. Also, I wasn´t very interested in the politics.<br />All in all, a good read. Faulks proves his versatility with this novel. Don´t expect another Birdsong though!	2003-10-23

I finally picked it it up this summer and I can´t recommend it enough. Whoever said that biographies are boring?<br />Sylvia Nash includes memories and opinions of a wide variety or people related to Nash´s personal and academic life. The maths are difficult to understand, and sometimes I thought that the author went into too much depths to try to explain them, but still, I read these parts with interest. The book is simmering with tension, involving the Cold War, the fierce competition for permanent posts in reknown Amercian universities, and above all John´s personal life. Nasar portays Nash as a person you admire but also despise.<br />As for the portayal of Nash´s mental illness, I was also pleased. I was specially surprised about how Nash´s family coped with the situation and how his colleagues helped him out with research contracts, during his better periods.<br />As for the movie, I enjoyed it a lot as well (I had seen it before reading the book), probably because the two are so different that the movie doesn´t seem like an adaptation of the book.<br />Don´t be put off by the book´s length!!! So far, this is my favorite book this year.	2003-10-03

The story is evocative and I appreciated how nicely it covers the 20th century in Canada, a country I dont know much about. I agree with other reviewers that this is not an easy read. The story of Laura and Iriss life is very involving, but the sci-fi sections and the encounters between the couple sometimes drag a bit. But all in all everything adds up to an original and exciting read which I recommend to everyone. And I love Mrs. Atwoods style...	2003-10-02

I cant deny that The Night Listener is engaging and easy to relate to. What I liked most is the way Gabriel describes the pain of losing a lover and falling into a depression. Its not easy to stick to him, but Maupins depiction of the loss is very accurate. However, the whole story about Pete and his relationship with Gabriel is unrealistic and creepy. We virtually cannot see the emotional scars that Pete carries due to his years of suffering. Perhaps the writer has tried to give us a clue, after all, we never know if Pete is really himself. But the fact that after a few phone calls, Gabriel and Pete are calling themselves father and son, made me feel very uneasy. Also, the subplot involving Gabriel and his father is cliched and boring.	2001-12-11

Irving´s new book left me pretty unsatisfied. The plot is contrived and clumsy and the characters feel wooden. And to think this comes from Mr. Irving, the guy who usually makes you root for his characters. The only ones I really enjoyed were Irma and Dr. Zajac, and they virtually diappeared midthrough! Worse still, Irving overuses the technique of telling the story, instead of letting his characters speak from themselves. I can´t recommend The Fourth Hand: Irving fans will find it disappointing and newcomers might as well try one of his better-known works.<br />What a shame it wasn´t better...	2001-11-15

At first I was excited by the story, even the humourous beginning intrigued me. Unfortunately the title of the book is misleading, since about two thirds of the novel is dedicated to Stingos trials and tribulations, and he is the least interesting of the three characters. The books power lies on Sophies story, wonderfully spilled in nonlinear fashion, with the true facts slowly emerging from the initial lies and decorations. Sophie is the antiheroine we seldom find in current novels: perpetually feeling guilty and unable to rebuild her life. Great story, its a shame it focuses so much on Stingo.	2001-10-16

The author tries too hard but the characters are simply too perfect to be interesting. Anna and her saintly devotion to her husband did not appeal to me at all.

Reminiscent in many ways to &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, &quot;When We Were Orphans&quot; is a fascinating novel. I am beginning to think that Ishiguro is one of the best English novelists around, and I can´t wait to get hold of his other works. The story revolves around Christopher Banks, a brooding well-known detective who has garnered a reputation among the high society of London. Very soon we discover that Banks is obsessed with his childhood, which ended abruptly when his parents were kidnapped in the English colonialised Shangai.<br />The book is divided in two sections. In the first, the story moves back and forth between Christopher´s present life in London and his childhood recollections in Shangai. I love how Ishiguro uses scenes to illustrate a certain feeling or point that Christopher wants to make, this is something that he used already in &quot;Remains of the Day&quot;. The family memories are particularly poignant and of course the language is crisp, beautiful and precise. In the second part of the story Banks sets off to Shangai to discover the fate of his parents. Ishiguro here takes more risks as we soon realise the implausibility of the plotline. Is everything in Banks´ imagination, or is he just embelleshing his discoveries? It is painful to discover how deluded from reality Banks is (and always was), and the extent to which his childhood traumatised him. The atmosphere of the Shangai section is dreamy and oppressive, and the pace in this part of the novel is much quicker, turning it into a real page turner.<br />I won´t give away any more of the plot. The great thing about this novel is that it can be read on different levels, and interpreted in different ways. I give it a solid five stars rating and urge you to read it at all costs.	2001-06-20

For me it was definitely a page-turner right till the end. The problem is that the pivotal event takes place right in the middle of the story and the novel lacks something after it. Don´t get me wrong, I still enjoyed it a lot, but it looked like another mystery book after the murder. For those who thought that the book would bear more resemblance to a Greek tragedy, I understand their disappointment. Another complaint is that we never get to really understand what is it that attracts this bunch of teenagers to Julian, who is portayed as an obnoxious, self-concious teacher. <br />Apart from this, I enjoyed how the novel revolved around the main character´s life in campus, with no apparent routine. Richard is an appealing character, and I was impressed by hoy the author conveyed his confusion towards the other characters in his book. I found him a very realistic character, and I appreciated that Tart didn´t make him behave as a hero. The other ones are well drawn as well, especially Bunny, but it is disappointing to see him disappear in the middle of the novel. Nevertheless I recommend you to read the book, you won´t be able to put it down.	2001-06-05

This is a great title for this book because that is exactly what it´s about. It is not a conventional story, it reads more like an autobiography of the author´s trips across the States. What follows is a frenzy of alcohol, sex, drugs, jazz and pseudophilosophy. I enjoyed Sal and Dean´s freedom but it was impossible for me to relate to them and Sal´s infatuation towards Dean, whom the book jacket describes as &quot;slightly crazed&quot;, was difficult to understand. It´s clear that Sal admired the intensity and passion which Dean showed in everyone of his crazy plans, but I suspect that underneath there was a surpressed love. I would have preferred, however, to know more about the other characters´ motivations (Sal, Mary Lou, Ed Dunkel, etc.) to go on the road, because Dean´s passion seemed to eclipse all the other characters.<br />I was thrilled by the intensity of the characters, this alone earns the book four stars. Not for everyone, but an exciting and thrilling ride.	2001-05-17

I really enjoyed the originality of the setting, the bizarre characters and Ignatius Reilly, what a riot! His dialogue is absolutely sharp and hilarious, we have to give credit to the author for this. And Ms. Trixie, ooohhhh!!! My favourite character of the novel, no doubt! But somehow the story lacks a plot, and Ignatiuss ramblings become derivative far too early into the book. Im sure I appreciated the humour and sarcasm in the story, but a better developed plot would have given it five stars.	2001-02-27

There is something very refreshing in the way this book is written; the prose is very straightforward as we see it through the eyes of Eddie, the novel's hero. My only complaint is that the novel seems too upbeat and unrealistic at times: Eddie seems to be unaffected by his grandfather's alcoholism, which gets worse as the story progresses. Also, his grandfather seems to recover with no particular difficulties. Eddie also seems much too balanced and perfect for the kind of life he lives, with no friends or parents. And it's not enough just being a Mann...<br />Still, if you happen to come across this book, give it a go. I'm looking foward to reading the sequel.	2000-11-20

It is true that is does not quite reach the emotional intensity of its predecessor, but it is still a great book, thunderously entertaining. Faulks is an inspired writer who can flesh out complex characters in an amazing way.<br />Of course, there were parts of the novel that I liked more than others. I didn't care much about the conflict between Charlotte and her father, or the way it was resolved. I also felt that the pace of the novel is uneven, slow at first but gradually increasing until the frenzy of the last section. Faulks does better when he recreates the atmosphere of the occupied French town. Of all the characters, I found Julien the most interesting, and Andre and Jacob's story completely drained me emotionally. I also loved how Faulks included references and characters from The Girl at the Lion d'Or and Birdsong.<br />For people who would like to know more about the activities of the English SOE agents in France, I heartily recommend reading &quot; A Quiet Courage&quot;, by Liane Jones (unfortunately out of print according to Amazon.com). This book is a real account of the activities of the English women sent as agents during World War II to France to help organise French resistance.<br />For an entertaining and involving read, try Charlotte Gray.

It is difficult to express the extent in which it has moved me. This is a winning novel, in all its aspects.<br />I found that the three main section of the novel complemented each other, unlike some other reviewers. The passionate affair between Isabelle and Stephen was completely believable and beautifully described. However, the heart of Birdsong lies in the muddy trenches, and it is here that it excels. We get a true feeling of what it was to be a soldier in WWI, and the image that we get is haunting. Some particular passages, like the prelude to the Somme attack and the last section when Stephen and Jack are trapped in the tunnel, are simply brilliant. There is so much compassion in these sections. All the characters are multidimensional, complex and utterly believable, and they will stay in your mind for days.<br />As for the flashbacks to the 1970s, I agree that it seems like a literary device. But they help make a connection between the WWI characters and our own lives, showing that many of our great-grandfathers could have lived through the same ordeal as Stephen, Weir and the rest.<br />The novel builds toward a fantastic, climatic ending, which I will not reveal because I believe you must experience it yourself. Birdsong is a masterpiece.	2000-10-13

I heard about this book many years ago but never  got around to read it, not really interested in a story about rabbits. Was  I wrong!!! I finally bought it and have enjoyed it inmensely, it is  definitely one of the best I've read this year. It starts off a bit slowly,  but the story soon picks up pace as the adventures of Hazel, Bigwig and the  rest start to unfold. This is more than an adventure story, not only it is  exciting, but the author manages to convey a certain depth to the story and  to the characters. He pulls this off nicely by sprinkling the book here and  there with stories and legends about mythological rabbits. I particularly  liked the part when one of the rabbits is telling a story and sudddenly he  stops, because a fox was coming. I found it very realistic.<br />In our  current world dominated by computers, traffic and money, it was really  refreshing to read this story about a bunch of rabbits who simply want to  find a place to live. This book should certainly appeal to everyone. Enjoy!	2000-09-18
US	49704382	R63ZVHQNPCR1W	034540047X	388275186	The Hotel New Hampshire	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Good, but a disappointment considering it is Irving	&quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; is an enjoyable novel, but it falls far from being memorable. Perhaps one of the reasons is that its structure,  themes and even settings are very similar to &quot;Garp&quot;, his previous  masterpiece. In fact, this novel could very well be called &quot;The World  According to the Berry Family&quot;. Unfortunately, what worked well in  &quot;Garp&quot; seems repetitive and somehow tiresome in this  novel.<br />First of all, there is the issue of Irving's constant recurrent  motives. I understand that every writer has his fixations. However this  novel seems to be driven more by these themes (Vienna, bears, prep-schools,  prostitutes, rapes, ...) than by the characters themselves. I mean, didn't  anyone find the whole Vienna section horribly tedious? Did anyone really  cared about the prostitutes or the radicals? And yes, these characters are  really bizarre, but was there really any substance behind? Not  really.<br />Another thing that really annoyed me is the irritating dialogue,  which is really a repetitive set of one-liners. This worked well in  &quot;Garp&quot;, but here it is derivative and tiresome. Yes, Mr. Irving,  the characters are bizarre, but it would have been nice to include some  more dialogue to get to know them a bit better. And what about the  ineffectual narrator? I would have preferred Frank, Franny or Lilly as a  narrator, since John was very unappealing. Also, Frank was very  underdeveloped.<br />Having said all this, I must say that the novel does have  its charms. Some characters, like Iowa Bob, Lilly, or even Egg, are  delightful. I enjoyed the part of the novel which takes place in The First  Hotel NH, and the ending was quite heartbreaking. Most of all, I liked the  loving, warm, cosy feeling of family unit that flows from the story.  &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; is an entertaining and original novel  which could have been much better.	2000-08-17

And it really succeeds, through the reactions, thoughts and dialogue of each character. Steinbeck shows no  compassion for his characters here, as all of them hide dark, deceptive  motives for the way they behave. In the end the book works like a mirror on  which we are reflected, and the image that we get is shocking and  depressing.<br />The plot moves slowly, specially at the beginning, and then  picks up as the bus starts its journey. I also thought that it would make a  great play, its format seems to be more of a play than a novel.<br />Read this  novel if you like a good, realistic character study, but don't expect much  entertainment.	2000-07-07

The Canadian society of the nineteenth century is portrayed with detail, thanks to the research carried out by the talented Mrs. Atwood. This clever writer uses  many techniques which contribute to the originality and the uniqueness of  this novel, like shifting the point of view from Grace to Dr. Jordan, or  allowing us to read the letters exchanged by the various characters of the  book, which I really enjoyed. I also liked the idea of including the  transcripts from Grace's confession and other accounts, which neatly frame  the story into the real events.<br />Why not five stars, then? I am not sure,  but I think that the murder story did not really grip me that much, and  Grace was a slightly annoying character. I was much more interested in Dr.  Jordan, his findings, doubts and fantasies.<br />Overall, a great book,  wonderfully written and highly recommendable.	2000-05-18

It is enormously entertaining, humourous, insightful, and filled with wonderful, bizarre and  Irvingian characters. Dr. Daruwalla, the main character, is one of the most  funny and likeable characters Irving has ever created. This book is  lightweight, compared to some of Irving's best known works, but it is  equally as enjoyable. An absorbing read from start to finish.	2000-05-08

It shows us what can happen when rationality and professionalism take over anyone's feelings. I found it difficult to root for the main character in this book, since he is holding  back his emotions and restraining himself all the time. The book is written  in first person and I was shocked about how Stevens, was always hiding what  he really felt. This is a masterful novel, in which everything excels. The  writing is beautiful, the dialogues are subtle, and the characters are  richly drawn. The author has weaven several themes in parallel  successfully.<br />The final encounter with Miss Kenton and the ending of the  novel are unforgettable. Read ths novel by all means, it will really touch  you and make you think about yourself.	2000-05-05

I found the premise very intriguing and I liked the way each chapter is devoted to one character, so we can see how the accident has affected each  of them. The atmosphere of a small town is nicely depicted. Of all the  characters, Nichole comes across as the strongest, and it is her chapter  that I enjoyed the most.<br />Overall, a good book, full of humanity. I  haven't seen the movie, but I am looking forward to.	2000-04-12
