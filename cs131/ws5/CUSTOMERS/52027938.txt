No old crones with shawls and crystal balls here.  Just lots of fun, practical advice about how tarot applies to our modern lives.  When I started tarot, I bought about a dozen books to guide me, including the classic texts.  The Smart Girl' Guide to Tarot has definitely become my favorite and most valuable resource for interpretting cards.  Unlike most authors who describe vague possible meanings, Emmi Fredericks gives witty and concrete guidance.  Fredericks clearly knows her stuff, and she's careful to include both traditional and alternative interpretations. <br /> <br />Much as I love this book and consider it a \\"must have\\" for any tarot enthusiast, it isn't comprehensive.  It glosses over the history of tarot and doesn't do a great job teaching about tarot spreads.  The illustrations are fun but don't show the classic symbolism you'll need to thoroughly interpret the cards.    <br />	2005-05-22

Not only is it a great hiking guide, but it also provides all sorts of useful information about the country and region in a very accessible format.  The authors have done a great job selecting hikes from a variety of regions and with varying skill levels.  Unlike most guides about Armenia, the directions are up-to-date and easy to follow - a notable accomplishment given the generally poor signage in the country.  Even if you aren't planning to hike, this book is an invaluable resource for anyone planning to venture beyond the city limits of Yerevan.  It points you to all the best sights.  Another bonus is the size - perfect for slipping in a pack or even a pocket.	2005-04-12

The cards follow the Rider Waite symbolism, but I find them much richer and informative than a Rider Waite deck.  Each card is a meticulous collage of medieval and renaissance art.  That necessarily means that there is some heavy Christian symbolism.  For some people, that will be a big selling point; for others, it's not so appealing.  For me personally, the art itself is so opulent and compelling that the Christian overtones are very secondary.  The cards themselves are a nice size on heavy cardstock and feel good in your hand.   <br /> <br />The guide that comes with the deck is brief but very instructional.  My major complaint is that it lists the minor arcana out of order - swords, wands, cups coins?  Reversals are barely addressed.   <br /> <br />	2004-10-17

Both are good stories and well told, but they don't belong in the same book, and each theme suffers from being linked with the other.  Ken and Andrew's journey from idealist do-gooders to disillusioned veterans with just enough hope left to justify one more mission - and the inevitable descent into hell - is heartbreaking.  Heidi's story is less interesting.  It's mostly just a outlandish series of sex and drug stories.  I'm recommending to my friends - and believe me, everyone in the development community is buzzing about this book - that they read Andrew and Ken first, then read Heidi separately.	2004-09-09

This is pretty much the definitive English-language guide for tourists.  You'll see people toting it along at all of the major historical attractions - with good reason.  Like most Eyewitness guides, it is incredibly user-friendly.  This book has it all - useful maps, readable background facts, helpful travel tips.  My favorite feature is the list of the top ten sites.  My only complaint is that the maps do not include the business districts - a serious oversight for the business traveler.  Nevertheless, no one should go to Istanbul without a copy of this book close at hand.    Since I wrote this review two years ago, I have lent the book to 8 people who were traveling to Istanbul, and they've all raved about it.  I was on a plane the other day making a connection through Istanbul and a distant acquaintance came over and showed me my copy that he'd borrowed via another friend.

There's no question that I was completely awed by Michael Frayn's intellectual creativity.  The story centers around a lost Bruegel painting that an English academian thinks he's spotted among his boorish and avaristic neighbor's art collection.  Frayn does an wonderful job of using the narrator's quest to authenticate the painting as a platform for discussing Netherlandish painting and history.  It's all quite impressive, but anyone who doesn't have a love of art history is likely to find themselves getting bogged down in some of the theoretical aspects.  Even though Frayn does a fine job describing Bruegel's known works, it might be very interesting to read &quot;Headlong&quot; with a copy of a book showing Bruegel's work sitting beside you.<br />My reservations about the book come from the rest of the plot which concerns the narrator's efforts to buy the painting without alerting its owner to its true value.  Yes, I know that the silly situations and outlandish schemes were supposed to be funny, but I personally found it so unbelievable that this very smart person would behave in such an outrageously stupid manner that it was more annoying than funny.  The farcical elements would undoubtedly have been more palatable if there hadn't been such a complete dichotomy between the incredibly sophisticated academic analysis and the silly plot.  It's frustrating because I think the whole scenario would have been funnier if the author had exercised a little more restraint.	2002-08-30

For anyone who wants to begin learning Russian, I wouldn't recommend relying on this book exclusively - you've got to have some language tapes or other means of aural study - but it makes for a nice compliment to more traditional texts.  Of course, the &quot;10 minutes a day&quot; concept is silly.  However, when study time comes around,I find myself turning to this book more than any other, especially when I only have a little time to study or when I've had a particularly draining day and don't feel up to more serious endeavors.  The stickers are great, and I've found the pronunciations to be pretty accurate.  It is a definite flaw that they don't show you the stressed vowels, but the individual pronunciations do account for the differences between stressed and unstressed vowels.  On its own, this book isn't going to teach you Russian, but it is a fun and accessible supplemental study tool.	2002-08-30

The authors do a great job of covering all the countries, and they have practical advice on necessary precautions.  The general information about the area is solid.  Every expat who lives here has a copy, and we all rely on it for advice on where to go and what to see.  Also, the historical review is thorough without being tedious, and the practical information on things like climate and local customs is generally dead on.  <br />Nevertheless, you can't rely on this book (or any other) for specifics like suggested hotels and restaurants or things like visa fees.  These all change so frequently in the CAR that everything is out of date before it's hit the printers.  Use this as a guide to the area, but don't rely on it for planning the details about where to stay and where to eat.	2002-08-27

The first thing I liked about this book was the heroine's career:  she's a modern day butler who can also act as a bodyguard.  Not only is this unconventional career interesting to read about (I never knew I needed a butler to iron my newspaper), but it also is the backbone of a unique suspense story.  Plus, I loved the subtle play throughout the book on \\"the butler did it.\\"  The second thing I liked was that the lead characters both had strongly developed and very realistic characters.  Neither is perfect - he's bitter about a recent divorce and she's emotionally reserved - but their character flaws read true and make for a more complex romance.  Finally, I liked the fact that Howard didn't try to keep the reader in the dark as to who the villain was.  It's usually so transparent in romantic suspense novels that I almost feel like the writer is insulting my intelligence when they try to be coy about \\"who done it.\\"  All in all, this is a good, solid romantic suspense novel and a compelling read.  I finished it in one sitting and will definitely put it on my \\"keeper\\" shelf.	2002-04-27

The prologue is a sublime parody of a typical interview for a position as a Manhattan nanny.  Scathingly witty and insightful, it is by far the best part of the book.  The novel, unfortunately, lacks the subtlety of the prologue.  Here, everything is taken too the extreme - the mother is truly a psychotic egomaniac, the child is the ultimate combination of brattiness and...neglect, the father is a malevolent ghost in his own home, and the nanny is a complete doormat.  The humor is dragged down by such extreme characrterizations.  This was particularly disappointing since the story has such great possibilities and the prologue proves that the authors are capable of a more honest comedic touch.  The book was a quick and entertaining read, but it could easily have been so much better.	2002-04-18

However, I admit that I was more than a little dubious that she would be able to successfully continue the series with the female Cynster twins, Amanda and Amelia.  They appeared in virtually all the other Cynster books as flighty husband-hunting debutantes.  &quot;On a Wild Night&quot; begins on a less than promising note as the two refine their plots for finding acceptable husbands.  This is not a premise that is likely to endear itself to most 21st century women.  Much to my surprise, Laurens manages not only to quickly transform Amanda into a likeable and sympathetic heroine, but also to create a romance that is more than worthy of the Cynster series.  The hero, Martin, is no fool and quickly spots Amanda's matrimonial intentions.  Even though the two are powerfully attracted to one another and their relationship rapidly becomes intimate, there are two hurdles standing in their way:  a scandal from Martin's past and his reluctance to admit the depth of his feeling for Amanda.  The last is straight out of every other Cynster novel - alpha male selects his mate but she refuses to accept him without a complete emotional surrender - but as always Laurens fills the romance with plenty of sensuality and the plot remains compelling.  Even though there are obvious similarities between all the Cynster romances, each one is still a unique and complete story unto itself.  Bring on Amelia's story!	2002-04-14

This is yet another romance where the heroine retains the help of a notorious rake to teach her - platonically - about passion so that she can seduce another man.  During the course of these &quot;lessons&quot;, the chemistry between pupil and teacher takes over and eventually leads to romance.  here, the book itself is OK, but the premise fares better in &quot;Educating Caroline&quot; by Patricia Cabot.  &quot;The Lady's Tutor&quot; by Robin Schone offers a much steamier take on it.  The hero in &quot;The Seduction of Sara&quot; is appealing and has some unique elements to his character.  Sara, not so much.  In the end this was merely a serviceable romance, not a really good one.	2002-04-05

The book begins when Caroline oversees her fiance with another woman.  The other woman turns out to be the fiance of Braden Granville, our hero.  Caroline plans to immediately call off her engagement, but her family's aristocratic credentials are questionable and her mother pressures her to continue the engagement to a marquis.  Caroline decides that perhaps her naivety is to blame for his wandering eye, so she solicits Braden's help in learning more about the romantic arts.  Braden has his own agenda which involves catching his fiance in compromising circumstances so that he can break his engagement.  No big surprises as to where all this eventually leads.  Normally I wouldn't have much use for a heroine who would willing remain engaged to a man who was cheating on her, but Patricia Cabot does a good job of making it work.  Both Caroline and Braden are strong, appealing characters, and their interaction is full of humor and sexual tension.  All in all, a very satisfying read.	2002-04-05

The plot is full of twists and turns, and it keeps you guessing right up until the very end.  The lead characters are compelling, and the love scenes are sufficiently steamy to keep romance fans happy.  The book is set in the San Juan Islands, and Lowell does an excellent job integrating the setting into the story.  She is also an expert at weaving interesting background research into her books.  Here, she not only educates you about all facets of amber and the amber trade, but she also makes the lesson very entertaining and a crucial part of the story. It's all a lot more interesting than you might have assumed.  My only complaint is that I would have liked to see more interaction between Hope and Jake, the lead characters.  Nevertheless, the chemistry between them is great and their witty banter makes for a fun read.	2002-04-01

The subject is engrossing and important, but the book itself is not well-written.  This accounts for the disparity in ratings that the book has received. <br />It is fascinating to read about Malika'a unique and frequently heartbreaking life.  The eldest daughter of a Morococcan general, she was taken from her family and adopted by the King.  Western readers will find the tales of her life in the royal household surprising and enlightening.  Not only was the lifestyle outrageously lavish, it was also consisted of customs and traditions that are completely different from our own.  Malika was allowed to return to her own family as a young teenager.  She only had a few years to get to know her father and enjoy life outside the confines of the palace.  Her father before General Oufkir was implicated in a coup attempt against the King and was assassinated.  The rest of the family - Malika, her mother, her oldest brother, three young sisters and three year old baby brother were summarily imprisoned.  For twenty years they lived in increasingly brutal and inhumane conditions, persecuted by the King for their father's crimes and forgotten by the world.  Thanks to their uncommon courage and ingenuity, the family was able to survive and eventually escape.  It's not easy to read about many of the horrors and indignities that were heaped upon the Oufkirs, but it's important that the world know about their story.<br />Unfortunately, the book is not worthy of this amazing story.  It was written by Malika with the assistance of Michele Fitoussi.  The first problem is that the book does not give sufficient background about either the history of Morrocco or General Oufkir's powerful role as one of the King's chief aides.  Those unfamiliar with Moroccanhistory will frequently find themself at a loss for context.  Second, given that this is Malika's first person account, it necessarily is a very one-sided version of history.  Not that I doubt her version of events - I just would have preferred a more complete and well-researched book that included not only Malika's story but also those of her siblings.  Malika frequently portrays herself as the backbone of the family, the strongest member who kept them all from succumbing to madness.  This very likely is true, but it would have a much greater impact coming from someone else.  Finally, the writing style is very repetitive and immature.  While Michele Fitoussi is very sympathetic to Malika's story and deserves much credit for persuading her to tell her story, I have no doubt that a more objective and skilled writer would have improved the quality of the book immensely.  Hopefully a serious scholar will undertake a complete telling of the Oufkir's story. I, for one, will be anxious to read it.	2002-03-31

The lead characters are classic Garwood - a brave, naive heroine and a strong, patient hero.  The genius of Garwood is that her heroines can be kind of flighty and ditzy and still be charming rather than annoying.  Here, Garwood does a wonderful job of blending her plot in with the Norman invasion of England and the subsequent relationship between the Normans and the Saxons.

Set in a midwest Polish Catholic community in the 1950s, it is a beautifully crafted glimpse of a time when the world was simpler and more innocent.  The primary characters are a grieving widower and a nun who is struggling with her vocation.  Spencer always does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into the emotional lives of her characters, and these two are particularly sympathetic.  The majority of the book focuses on their individual struggles before turning to the romance that springs from their mutual respect and support.  The love story is very sweet and handled with great sensitivity.  I also enjoyed the glimpse into the inner life of the nuns.	2002-03-16

The movie is very enjoyable on in its own terms, but it is a highly edited version of the real story that is so thoroughly examined in the book.  See the movie first, then read this well-written and very well researched book.  Sylvia Nasar does an excellent job of explaining Nash's very esoteric work to the layman, and she is also very good at describing the insular and peculiar world of academic mathematics.  Nash's story is compelling on its own terms, and Nasar wisely sticks to the facts.  My only complaint about the book is that the cast of characters is so large that it is very difficult to keep up with them. Nasar is very thorough in describing all the mathematicians who knew or worked with Nash, including descriptions of the work of each one.  While it makes for an excellent &quot;who's who&quot; of 20th century mathmaticians, many of the esteemed mathmaticians are only tangential to Nash's life and spending so much time on them bogs down the story.  Nevertheless, it's hard to criticize an author for being too historically thorough.  All in all, an intereresting and informative book.	2002-02-23

The dangers the family took for granted - terrorists, land mines, all manner of poisonous creatures - are almost incomprehensible.  Fuller's family fought to maintain white rule in Rhodesia, and she does an excellent job of handling the sensitive subject.  The Fuller family is colorful in the extreme, and Fuller's writing style brings them beautifully and lovingly to life.  Make no mistake, this was a tough childhood, and at times it is difficult to remain non-judgmental about the dangers to which the Fuller parents were willing to expose their children.

Most every American alive knows what it would take to get fit (exercise) and lose weight (eat less fat and junk).  To a certain extent, therefore, &quot;Get with the Program&quot; is just a re-formulation of the hard facts we all know.  What Bob Greene has devised is a realistic and relatively painless way of adopting those healthy practices into your life on a long-term basis. There are 4 incremental stages to the program which are simple and designed for each person to follow at their own pace. This means that you don't have to wake up tomorrow morning, starve yourself and run out the door for 2 hours at the gym.  Step 1 is simple:  start a minimum of aerobic exercise, basic stretches and some abdominal exercises a couple of times a week.  Easy enough.  Once you've thoroughly incorporated that into your life, you move on to stage 2 where exercise picks up a little.  Not until you reach stage 4 do you begin to actively change your eating habits; that can be months or years later.  This is a fitness program that isn't intimidating and isn't going to require you to drastically change your whole lifestyle immediately in order to get results and start feeling better about yourself.  This means that a lot of people who haven't been successful in weightloss or exercise programs before are finally going to succeed in making long-term changes to their lives. Again, this isn't a radical fad diet (in fact, the nutritional advice is rather skimpy - follow Greene's principals, but don't hesitate to supplement the nutritional info if you need to)- it's about making gradual changes at a pace you can live with.	2002-02-06

Not only does it successful incorporate most of the themes of the fantasy genre, but it also sets a new standard by which all later works will be judged.  I was particularly impressed with the way Marion Zimmer Bradley was able to incorporate all the elements of the Arthurian myths in such a unique and creative way.  Second, there is no denying that the book is a significant statement of feminist philosophy.  Bradley carefully explores the transition from matriarchal to patriarchal society with the advent of civilization.  At times I felt like I was reading textbooks from my college Women's Studies courses.  Third, &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; explores the rise of Christianity and its inevitable clash with pagan religions.  Here is where I thought the book stumbled.  Bradley spends most of the book exploring the idea that Christianity was intolerant of other religious beliefs and aggressively sought to eradicate them.  I found the ending (which I won't reveal) inconsistent with Bradley's formulation of Christianity and the beliefs of Avalon.  Nevertheless, there are many layers to this beautifully crafted novel.  Whatever their personal philosophy or beliefs, readers will be challenged by the multitude of viewpoints.  My biggest complaint about the novel is that I felt it could have used a better editor.  I love long, complex books, but this is a story that could have been told in 450-600 pages, not the 800+ of my paperback edition.  When I found myself getting bogged down in the middle of the book, I skipped about 100 pages and didn't feel like I'd missed a thing in terms of plot, character development or theme.	2002-02-04

Any fan of Linda Howard's Mackenzie series has anxiously anticipated the story of the Mackenzie's adopted son, Chance.  Sure enough, Chance is still his irrestible sexy self, and Howard has given him the perfect mate.  Sunny Miller is delightfully spirited and does a wonderful job of standing up to Chance's strong personality.  She also has a dark secret that Chance is determined to uncover.  It's great fun to watch the two of them match wits, and the sexual tension between them is intense.  The relationship alone makes this a satsfying ending to the Mackenzie saga.  The plot is fast-paced and suspenseful, but there are some inconsistencies that I found distracting.  For example, Howard makes a point of stating that Chance personally scouted out the location for a critical showdown at the same time that he supposedly never leaves Sunny's side.  When it comes to intrigue, Chance is good, but he's not that good.  This and a few other rough spots left me feeling like Howard was rushing too much to get this book out.  Still, the romance between the two lead characters was so strong that I'll happily forgive a few plot flaws.	2002-02-03

If you aren't wealthy, young, single and living in New York City, don't try this at home.  There are very few people who can wear the clothes shown on \\"Sex in the City\\" in real life without looking ridiculous, and the same applies to the advice in this book.  That doesn't mean it isn't an entertaining read.  Think of it as a glimpse of an exotic and fabulous make-believe world.  The women of \\"Swell\\" don't work in cubicles, don't have kids, can go out on the town every night, have weekend retreats and lots of zany friends.  In fact, their lives would make a great sitcom on HBO...sorry, the similarities are just too obvious not to repeat the comparison.  Sure, there are some bits and pieces in the book that will come in handy - hang over remedies, how to emerge from a limo at a big Hollywood premiere, how to throw together a last minute New Year's Eve party that culminates at midnight on a trampoline - but let's face it, this is not going to be a daily primer for your life.  The authors keep referring to Frank Sinatra and Holly Golightly as models to emulate.  It might work for you some of the time, but adopt it as a formula for living at your own risk.	2002-02-01

She knows all the elements that make for a great contemporary romance, but she just can't seem to make them work.  Zany characters - check; fun plot - check; witty dialouge -check; sensual tension - check.  The problem is that it all seems so forced.  Take \\"Next Stop - Paradise.\\"  The lead characters are promising, but the heroine is poorly developed.  She's a cop who used to work in some vague corporate job - that's about all we know.  She thinks the hero is sleezy because he has a television career debunking supposed miracles and strange happenings.  Last time I checked, it was promoting supposed miracles and strange happenings that was sleezy, not debunking them.  There's no real chemistry between the leads, and the love scenes are very rote.  Then there's the plot.  A sea monster and/or a very large reptillian egg appear on a beach.  Why do we care?  It never makes any sense, isn't explained and is nothing but a device to bring people together.  Way too much time is spent on the secondary characters - we learn more about the mayor's wardrobe than we do about the lead characters' feelings for one another.  Civil-Brown is striving to write like Jennifer Crusie, but the result is more like romance road kill.	2002-01-30

It is the story of Marilee Nelson, a nice Catholic girl from a small Oregon town who abruptly broke off her engagement to her football star fiancee, Joe Lakota.  A decade later, Joe returns to town with his fragile young son and quickly realizes that there were tragic circumstances that caused Marilee to break up with him years ago.  He proceeds to gently but persistently tear down her emotional barriers and try to recapture the romance of their youth.  Anderson is an extremely sympathetic writer, and she handles the backlash of physical and emotional trama very well.  Her characters are appealing, and the sensual tension is well-paced.  Unfortunately, this is ground that Anderson has traveled before, and more adeptly, in &quot;Forever After.&quot;  If you've enjoyed Anderson's previous work, you will like &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, but don't expect to see something new from this talented writer.	2002-01-28

The hero, Zack Warren, is very well drawn.  Thanks to Crusie's vivid prose, you really get a strong sense of his edgy energy and intense emotional reactions.  The heroine, Lucy Savage, just got a quicky divorce, and lives in a great house with her rather unique dogs, including one who performs a dog joke.  Even though she's suffering from a bad dye job that left her hair green, she is enjoying feeling independent and adventurous - handy since people are shooting at her and planting bombs in her house.  Zack, a police officer, moves in to protect her, and there's lots of fun reading as these two strong personalities try to come to grips wih their strong attraction.  A classic contemporary romance scenario.  My problem with the book is that the unknown threat that brings them together doesn't work.  The jumping off point for the back plot is Lucy's ex-husband, Bradley.  Zack believes Bradley has something to do with the bombs, etc.; Lucy is adamant that her ex is too staid and boring to be involved in a crime.  First, I couldn't reconcile the Lucy we see in the story with the doormat that married a man she always found extremely dull.  Second, the crime isn't very interesting, and the bad guys' motivation for threatening Lucy just isn't believable.  If you concentrate on Zack and Lucy and their relationship and ignore the rest, you'll enjoy this book.	2002-01-14

Dylan Taber, the hero of Rachel Gibson's &quot;True Confessions,&quot; fits the mold perfectly.  If only these guys existed in real life.  Unfortunately, that might spawn a massive crime wave among the women of America.  Not only does Gibson give us wonderful heros, but she also creates some of the most unique, realistic and relatable heroines in romance novels.  Hope Spencer is no exception.  These two meet in Dylan's hometown of Gospel, Idaho.  Hope is a city girl who's moved to town for the summer, and she finds its much more remote than she was expecting.  She's constantly surprised by the vagarities of the local populace - old ladies with purple hair, toilet tossing contests and Rocky Mountain oysters, to name a few - and they make wonderful fodder for her secret work as a tabloid writer.  Sheriff Taber is a reformed hell-raiser raising his young son with some secrets of his own.  Thanks to his new position of responsibility in the community and the twisted reputation of his predecessor, he's been living like a monk even though all the single women in town are after him.  Once he lays eyes on Hope, that becomes a whole lot harder.  Gibson has created two wonderful characters, and both the dialogue and the plot are funny and charming.  A great recipe for a contemporary romance!	2002-01-14

I'll accept some mea culpa here, but it's annoying to have a book hyped as a &quot;new&quot; release when there's nothing &quot;new&quot; about it.  Fortunately, these are three of my favorite works by Howard, and it's nice to have them together in a hardback edition.  Howard is a master at adapting the novella format to contemporary romance.  Her focus is almost exclusively on the characters and instantly building a sharp sexual tension between them.  In each of these stories, the characters meet for the first time and circumstances allow them to skip most of the subtleties of courtship and move straight into steamy and intense relationships.  &quot;Lake of Dreams&quot; is the first work I ever read by Howard, and ever since she's been one of my favorite authors.  &quot;Blue Moon&quot; and &quot;White Out&quot; are even better.  If you like contemporary romance - and you don't already own these stories - &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; is an essential addition to your library.	2002-01-06

Fans of the Bar Cynster series may be disappointed; even though these are regency romances, they are far tamer than the sensual Cynster series.  Nevertheless, both stories are fun and have compelling Cynster-ish heroes.  I found the heroine in &quot;Tangled Reins&quot; annoying - one of those spunky young ladies who proves her independence by doing exactly the stupid/dangerous thing the hero warns her not to do, thus allowing him to rescue her.  The heroine in &quot;Fair Juno&quot; was more interesting - a widow whose former husband fell into disgrace and committed suicide.  Unfortunately, Laurens doesn't develop the interesting emotionally angles here as fully as she might.  Despite my complaints, these were fairly innocuous stories and a light, pleasant read.	2002-01-06

Lisa Jewell's &quot;thirty nothing&quot; is an enchanting addition to the field.  The two protagonists - Dig and Nadine - are Londoners with dream jobs, cool flats and messed up love lives.  As these two life-long best friends turn thirty, they dispair that neither will ever be able to have a mature, committed relationship.  OK, even a native tribesman from New Guinea would know where this is headed, but the journey is lots of fun and well worth the trip.  The characters are beautifully fleshed-out, and Jewell's writing style is humorous and engaging.  Just because you know where you're going doesn't mean you won't have a great time getting there.	2002-01-06

He weaves together thousands of first-hand accounts of the action on that momentous day into a comprehensive and compelling read.  After setting the scene of the planning and preparation, he traces the action of all the myriad forces involved - paratroopers, bombers, naval crews of all sizes and the invading infantry - on each of the five invasion beaches.  The book includes helpful charts and maps of both the original objectives and the actual action.  The individual stories powerfully convey the emotions and challenges faced by the troops.  The majority of the book focuses on the American forces, but the Canadians and British forces are adequately addressed.  Ambrose does a wonderful job of explaining the military strategy and technical details without compromising the momentum of the story.  All in all, an exciting and highly readable account of a pivotal historical event.	2002-01-06

It's hard not to compare &quot;Boone's Lick&quot; to &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; - both novels are named after small, depressed post-Civil War towns and evolve into journeys across the Western frontier.  However, while &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; was a grand epic, &quot;Boone's Lick&quot; is more of a novella.  It follows the fates of the Cecil family - mother Mary Margaret, Uncle Seth, narrator Shay, dim-witted brother GT and assorted characters they meet along the way - as they set off across the Oregon trail to find their wayward patriarch.  As always, McMurtry's characters are uniquely memorable, and he effortlessly conveys both the grandeur and the challenges of the West.  McMurtry's realism is so comprehensive that he even weaves real historical characters and events into his narrative.  The story itself is charming - I read it effortlessly in one sitting.	2002-01-06

Standing on its own, I'd imagine that it would be considered a top-notch regency romance.  As in all of Laurens' books, the hero, Sebastian, is devastatingly handsome, madly in love with the heroine and woes her with single-minded determination.  The plot is entertaining, and the love scenes are intense.  My problem with the book?  It was difficult to accept the heroine, Helena, who appears in the Bar Cynster series as a family matriarch, as a somewhat flighty young girl.  Furthermore, the whole love story was tainted for me because of some facts that Bar Cynster fans already know about the conception of Sebastian and Helena's son Scandal.  These aren't characters who cried out for their story to be told; in fact, I would have liked this story much better if it had been totally divorced from the Cynsters.	2002-01-06
US	52027938	R19AAX3B4GVI89	0312253079	560044213	Alexandra: The Last Tsarina	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Readable but flawed study of a difficult subject	Carolly Erickson's biography of Alexandra, the last tsarina of Russia, is highly readable, but it relies on too few questionable sources and errs on the side of being too sympathetic to its subject.   Erickson excels at depicting the atmosphere in Petrograd during the early reign of Nicholas II leading up to the revolution. She capture the hardships suffered by the general populace and contrasts it nicely with the extravagance of the Russian nobility.  Her narrative flows nicely and brings the core characters to life.  Despite Erickson's skill as a writer, however, this biography is ultimately flawed.<br />Few biographers are unable to resist the temptation to portray Alexandra as a martyr who heroically nursed her hemophiliac son and was tragically murdered.   While Erickson acknowledges that Alexandra adamantly refused sound advice that contradicted her own beliefs, dominated her weak-willed husband and in the face of all reason insisted upon associating with popularly despised and discredited religious mystics, Erickson nevertheless attempts to portray her as a misunderstood victim of circumstances.  For example, she acknowledges Alexandra's complete failure to be accepted by the Russian court, but she lays the blame solely at the feet of their callous lack of sympathy for Alexandra's paralyzing shyness. Surprisingly, this shyness was never remarked upon during Alexandra's early life in Germany and England.  Erickson never considers that Alexandra, raised in rigid Victorian formality, disapproved of the much less restrained Russian court and made her feelings all too clear.  Erickson also seems to bend over backwards to justify Alexandra's continued reliance upon Rasputin, but there can be no excuse for her insistence upon maintaining the relationship despite the clear damage it was causing to the reputation of the monarchy.  Given the extreme political upheaval in Russia at the time, it is unlikely that anyone in Alexandra's position would have been able to avert the eventual crisis, but there is no doubt that her behaviour contributed to the downfall of the monarchy.  This biography, unfortunately, tends to excuse her behaviour rather than analyze it critically.	2002-01-05

Crace masterfully interweaves multiple time-lines in the lives of Joseph and Celice, including the tale of their decaying bodies after they are murdered on a beach.  Joseph and Celice were married middle-aged zoologists.  They were essentially unremarkable people, and their mundane lives are easily overwhelmed by their shared death.  Crace's prose is often lyrical and always beautifully crafted - a stunning juxtaposition to the gruelling and gruesome scenes he is describing.  Many people will be put off by his frank and vivid descriptions of dead bodies, but in many ways it is a fitting epitath for these pragmatic scientists.  Altogether a challenging and impressive read.	2001-12-31

How great it was to reconnect with this old friend!  King is so prolific and so populist that his work is easily dismissed by serious critics, and that's a shame.  \\"Dreamcatcher\\" is a perfect example of his brilliance at work.  The central concept - bodysnatching aliens - is an old one, but King gives it new life.  As always, his plot is imaginative, compelling, and just the right amount of horrifying.  His core characters are similar to the \\"everyman\\" lead in most of his novels, but more layered and finely nuanced.  There are characters within characters, literally and figuratively.  The story is beautifully paced, and King masterfully weaves the different plotlines together - much like a dreamcatcher.  Even things that would normally turn me off a book are surprisingly well done.  While I generally consider scatological stories juvenille and a [poor] attempt to shock, it actually makes reasonable scientific sense in the context of this plot, unpleasant as it is.  <br />An interesting little side note - the action in this book takes place in the November after the 2000 election, i.e. November 2001.  At the time King wrote the book, the presidency was still undecided.  As part of the story, the new president must speak to the nation and soothe everyone's fears about the threat presented by the alien invaders.  The speech leans heavily on the patriotic and is considered to be the new president's finest hour and erases the scandal of the election.  Eerie.	2001-12-04

Her job and her life are a study in stillness.  Martin tells her story with complete honesty and beautifully nuanced prose.  A description of a Saturday night:  &quot;...Mirabella in not afraid to go to a local bar alone, which this night she does, where she might run into someone she knows or nurse a drink and listen to the local band.  As she sits in the booth...it never occurs to Mirabella to observe herself, and thus is spared the image of a shy girl alone in a bar on a Saturday night.&quot;  He also perfectly captures LA at the turn of the millenium.  His description of a gallery showing:  &quot;The party needs a volume control but there isn't one, and everyone would be straining to hear each other except they are all talking simultaneously.&quot;  Even though their themes are ultimately very different, Martin's writing style and eye for detail kept reminding me of Fitzgerald in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.  Obviously, I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2001-12-01

Even though &quot;Shades of Twilight&quot; is less than perfect, it will still be a welcome read for Linda Howard fans.  Howard continues to do what she does best - deliver intense, steamy modern romances with a hint of mystery to keep the plot moving along.  The core romance is strong, and as usual, the hero is an appealing combination of  tender caring and strong masculinity.   My biggest problem with this book was that the heroine was just too passive - not the spunky, independent modern woman you'd expect in a Linda Howard novel.  I also wasn't crazy about the cliche Southern family all living together under one big roof with distant cousins pairing up.  That doesn't really work in a contemporary novel, but Howard comes close to pulling it off.  Despite my complaints, I did enjoy the book, and you will too if you have enjoyed other Linda Howard novels.  However, if you aren't familiar with Howard's work, better to start with one of her better novels.  &quot;After the Night&quot;, &quot;Dream Man&quot; or any of the MacKenzie saga would be great choices.	2001-11-24

Here, Small offers a surprisingly restrained and enjoyable story set in the middle ages.  The setting is a nice change of pace from the glut of regency-era romances, and Small does a pretty good job of striving for historical accuracy.  A fair portion of the novel is set in a convent, and it is an interesting exploration of the education and lifestyle experienced by young women of the era.  The core love story is very sweet, and even the villains have redeeming virtues.  Yes, there are still some explicit scenes some may find offensive, but they fit into the story better than in most of Small's books.   The heroine is actually treated nicely, and the emotional relationships among the characters are well done.	2001-11-22

Historian Christopher Hibbert brings his considerable talent  for writing personal biographies to the fascinating subject of Britain's King George III.  Not only is Hibbert's scholarship solid, but he also does a wonderful jo of combining all the important elements of the King's life into an entertaining and compelling read.  George III was on the throne for almost 60 years during a period of great social and political upheaval throughout the western world, yet many don't know much about him.  Americans especially know little more about him that the tyranical caricature popularized during the American Revolution.<br />The book begins with a chapter about the King's dissolute father whose personality and relationship with his family were remarkably similar to that of George III's own son, the future George IV.  Hibbert establishes George III's own unique personality by examing both his early upbringing and the key political players who helped shape his dedication to duty.  George III certainly lacked the flamboyance of both his father and son.  In contrast, he was sober and prudish, but nevertheless quite interesting and complex.   During his reign he weathered both the American and French Revolutions, long periods of war abroad, and various periods of political unrest at home.  Throughout, Hibbert paints a portrait of a monarch selflessly concerned about his subjects and dedication to providing thoughtful leadership.  As for his personal life, the King was faithfully resigned to an arranged marriage with a rather plain and increasingly unpleasant woman with whom he had 15 children.  The family dynamics make for great reading.  His relationships with most of his sons were difficult and a sources of much frustration since they frequently refused to comply with his strict mandates.  His many daughters were mostly confined to the royal household and were expected to wait attendance on the King and Queen.  A few daughters managed to ecape into marriage late in life, andothers had scandalous love affairs with the King's courtiers.  All of this family drama was further acerbated by the mysterious &quot;madness&quot; that George III began to suffer from periodically in his middle age.  By the time the madness begins, Hibbert has done such a wonderful job of establishing the King's decency and dignity that the reader cannot help but be moved as these very qualities are brutally stripped away by his disease.  Also, there is an appreciation of the magnitude of the political crisis it precipitated.  <br />My one complaint about this book is that, at least in this American's opinion, Hibbert almost completely glosses over the American Revolution.  His general analysis - that the Americans unjustly demonized the King - has some merit, but it virtually ignores the significant economic and social changes  that created the Revolution.  Perhaps such political theory is beyond the scope of this personal biography, but it should be examined more thoroughly, not only with regards to the American Revolution but also with regards to how these changes were successfully integrated into the British constitutional monarchy.	2001-11-19

I'd really, really like to be able to simply dismiss Jonathan Frazen's &quot;The Correstions&quot; as the scribbling of a pretentious little prig.  Unfortunately, it's not that easy.  The book, standing on its own merit, didn't justify the pre-Oprah hype, and it probably doesn't deserve to be completely lost in the post-Oprah backlash.  (For those who don' t know:  The book was selected for the Oprah book club; hundreds of thousands of extra copies were printed; in interviews the author said he wasn't happy about the Oprah selection and that his book really wasn't  appropriate for Oprah readers; perhaps figuring that anyone so stupid as to look this gift horse in the mouth wouldn't be smart enough to fill an hour-long show, Oprah cancelled his appearance). <br />Let's start with the cons.  First, Franzen's prose is frequently overblown and too self-conscious.  A sample description of a windy day:  &quot;A sheet of newsprint wrapped itself around a parking meter with erotic-looking desperation.&quot;  Please.   Let's just say he's light years behind Toni Morrison. Second, the book starts very slowly.  I'm an easy sell, and it took me over 200 pages to get truly interested.  A minor plot point in the book is that one of the characters has written a screenplay.  The big tip off that the screenplay is garbage and that the character has no idea what he's doing is that the screenplay begins with a six page monologue.  Hello!   Third, given that this novel is character-driven, it's unfortunate that a few of the leads are so poorly drawn.  The women in particular are ill-defined.  Which leads to point number four:  no question about it - there's a huge streak of misogyny throughout the book.  Rather consistent with the author's bashing of Oprah book club readers.    <br />Now for the reason we shouldn't all blithely ignore &quot;The Corrections.&quot;  This is basically the story of a family struggling to come to grips with the slow and painful deterioration of its patriarch from Parkinson's disease.  Here Franzen hits all the right notes.   The children have always known their father as a formal but unapproachable man.  Only as his dignity is being slowly and painfully stripped away do they begin to know him.   If Franzen hadn't cluttered the book with so many extraneous sub-plots and self-indulgent development of secondary  characters, this could have been a truly great book.	2001-11-12

This memoir of his experiences during the war was published posthumously, and clearly was not intended by the author to be published in this form.  Not that the book is without merit - far from it.  Webster was obviously a very talented writer and he does an excellent job of sharing his impressions and experiences.  His account of D-Day, the fighting in Holland and the final advance into Germany are all interesting and insightful.  The problem is that the manuscript is incomplete.  While the primary stories are here, all the connecting bits are missing.  For example,  the chronicle of the action in Holland ends when Webster is wounded and evacuated.  The narrative resumes when he rejoins his company in France, after their remarkable stand at Bastogne.  However, there is no real effort to explain what happened in his absence, and principal characters from earlier in the narrative have disappeared without explanation  and new ones appear without introduction.  No doubt these rough spots would have been smoothed over if the author had been available to edit the manuscript.  Nevertheless, the stories that are here are remarkably well told and offer a unique perspective on the war.  Webster was adamant about remaining a lowly private throughout the war, and as an intellectual among the lowliest soldiers, he had a unique viewpoint on army life.  Stephen Ambrose incorporates significant portions of Webster's manuscript into &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, and reading the two books together fills in many of the gaps in Webster's narrative.	2001-10-22

The first part of the book about the formation of the paratroopers and their early training will be familiar to those who have read Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; or watched the HBO miniseries.  From D-Day forward, however, the stories are very different.  In comparison to &quot;Currahee!&quot;, BoB appears to be an almost sanatized version of the invasion and fighting in Normandy.   In &quot;Currahee!&quot; Burgett does not hesitate to vividly describe the horrors of war - excrutiating wounds, rotting corpses, moments of incredible fear and agony.  Even if you think that you are prepared to face these grim realities, you will still find Burgett's frankness disturbing.  However, I encourage you not to let this put you off reading this book.  Burgett's experience in Normandy was extraordinary, and he does a masterful job of conveying all the terror, exhilaration and grief he experienced.  Since this is just one man's story, it necessarily captures only one perspective about a limited part of the invasion, but Burgett's skillful storytelling successfully conveys what many of the troops must have been thinking and feeling during those remarkable days.	2001-10-22
US	52027938	R1UHXH3SFRJZYH	0380812029	66659014	All About Passion	Books	5	19	21	N	Y	Another great regency romance by Laurens	&quot;All About Passion&quot; confirms that these days the best regency romances are being written by Stephanie Laurens.  This is the story of the Earl of Chillingsworth, a secondary character who appeared throughout Laurens' Bar Cynster series.  Chillingsworth is every bit as complex and appealing a hero as the Cynsters, and thankfully he isn't burdened with one of their silly names (Devil, Demon, Lucifer, etc.).   He recognizes that he has a duty to marry and beget heirs, so he cold-heartedly sets out to contract a suitable match.  Thanks to a childhood trauma, he is leery of deep emotions, and wants his marriage to be a politely distant one.  Much to his surprise, his bride, Francesca,  turns out to be the antithesis of what he was expecting.  Francesca is simply a great heroine.  She's smart, self-confident and passionate.  There's very little plot in this book besides the primary characters trying to work out their relationship.  However, since they are so well-developed and interesting, it makes for a good story.   If you don't read romance novels, you won't get much from this book, but romance fans will find it thoroughly satisfying.	2001-10-21

She is raised by the Sommers family, a beautiful sister dedicated to her spinsterhood and her very English, very conservative brother.  There are regular visits from the Sommers' sea captain brother, and Eliza is also partially raised by the Sommers' Chilean servants.  Even though the Sommers have high hopes for her future, Eliza impetuously falls in love with a penniless Chilean clerk who abandons her to join the California gold rush.  Thanks to her unconvential upbringing, Eliza has the courage to strike out on her own after him with the assistance of her Chinese friend Tao Chi'en.<br />Allende's remarkable talent accurately brings to life the English ex-patriot community in Chile, Tao Chi'en's peasant childhood and apprenticeship as a traditional Chinese doctor, the wild, untamed early days of the California gold rush and the rapid civilization of San Francisco.  To portray any one of these settings so realistically would be noteworthy; to combine them all so artfully in one book is truly breathtaking.  The scope of this book is amazing, and some readers may regret that we only get glimpses of some of the pivotal characters and that several plotlines and relationships are never fully resolved.  Personally, I thought this was another example of Allende's realism.  So often in life we only know a fraction of the life and personality of those who indelibly alter our own lives, and we seldom receive neat conclusions where all of life's mysteries are resolved.	2001-10-01

Notwithstanding the wonderful HBO miniseries based on this book, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is an entertaining and worthwhile read in its own right.  Ambrose skilly fully weaves personal accounts from the paratroopers of E Company into a compelling story of the war in the European theater.  Ambrose has earned his stripes as one of the premier historians of World War II, and with good reason.  His writing style is easy to read, he does a great job of individualizing the large cast of characters and he masterfully sets his story within the context of the greater conflict without distracting the reader.  <br />All this makes the book essential reading for those watching the HBO miniseries.  The miniseries is great cinema, but the medium is necessarily limited in how much background it can bring to each episode.  After the first few episodes I started reading the book along with the show, and it helped me in distinguish the characters and orient what was happening.  Also, the book gives you a greater understanding of why certain objectives were so critical to the war effort.  When I've read the part of the book that corresponds to a new episode, I get to focus on the performances and visual aspects of the show.  Reading the book only enhances the experience of watching the miniseries.	2001-10-01

This is the best and most practical cookbook I've bought all year.  In fact, I consider to be one of my top ten of all time - and I've got a lot of cookbooks.  These are the recipes you will turn to several times a week when you come home from a long day at work but still want to put something delicious on the table.  When I first started reading this great cookbook, I grabbed some post-its and began flagging all the recipes that I wanted to try.  I should have saved myself the bother, because I ended up flagging almost all of them.  From stir-fries to salads to dinner-in-a-bowl soups to baked potatoes to easy grilling recipes, it's all here and it all looks great.  <br />The magic of this book is that the editors from Bon Apettit have taken some of the best recipes from their outstanding magazine and cleverly adapted them so that they are very user friendly but lose none of their original appeal.   For example, peach pie is just about my favorite dessert, and when their recipe for Vanilla Peach Pie appeared in the magazine, it quickly became my favorite version of this American classic.  The Vanilla Peach Pie recipe appears once again in this book, but this time it calls for refrigerated pie crusts, not time-consuming homemade crusts.  Sure, you could make your favorite pie crust if you wanted to, but what makes this recipe special is the filling, not the crust.  You'll find such time saving adaptions throughout this book, and since the recipes are so easy and practical, you're much more likely to use them.  This is a true kitchen essential for everyone from beginning cooks to experienced pros.	2001-09-30

For the rest of you, hang onto your hats - you're in for a wild ride!  Robin Schone's unique talent blends emotionally intense love stories with imaginative and graphic erotic scenes, and she pushes those boundaries even further in &quot;Gabriel's Woman.&quot;  Gabriel is familiar to readers of Schone's &quot;The Lover&quot; as the aloof proprietor of an establishment that specializes in all kinds of sensual pleasures.  Gabriel himself, however, is not a participant.  As a youth he was trained to be a prostitute that pleasured men and women, but due to some unknown trauma in his past, he can no longer tolerate another's touch.  &quot;Gabriel's Woman&quot; begins with the grand reopening of the House of Gabriel.  An upper class woman appears and boldly offers to auction off her virginity.  Gabriel immediately realizes that the woman, Victoria, is a pawn sent to him by the mysterious man who brutalized him in the past.  For her safety and in order to discover the mysterious man's plot, Gabriel buys Victoria.  Even though his phobia of intimacy remains, he is inevitably  attracted to her and his long dormant sexuality is awakened.  Victoria has been unjustly forced from her position as a governess and was driven to the House of Gabriel by desperation.  Nevertheless, she too is immediately aware of the intense attraction between herself and Gabriel.  As she begins to know him better, she becomes determined to help him fight his personal demons and allow him to experience all the pleasure he has missed in life.<br />Both Gabriel and Victoria are immensely appealing characters, and the reader can't help but become invested in their quest to make each other happy.  As usual, Schone gives us several erotic scenes, some so extreme that even the most jaded reader will be startled.  At times the book reads like a sex manual, including step-by-step instructions for new uses for breath mints.  The surrounding plot is necessary to explain Gabriel's reticence, but it was my least favorite part of the book.  The overall gloomy atmosphere got tiresome, and when the climatic confronation with the bad guy finally came around, I was so sick and tired of ominous references to &quot;the second man&quot; that I wanted to scream.  Still, you don't read Schone for the plot, so this is a minor nitpick at best.	2001-09-29

Late twentyish-thirtyish singles coming to grips with their love lives, their careers, their friends. The twist is that in this book the focus is primarily on the male characters' early adulthood crisises, not the women's. This is an ensemble piece, and Lisa Jewell has created an interesting cast. There are two prinicipal story lines: Smith, Ralph and Jem, flatmates caught in an undeclared love triangle; and Karl and Siobhan, a long term couple struggling to discover if they have a future together. All the characters live in the same apartment building, and their lives become increasingly intertwined. Jewell has a wonderful command of both character development and plot, and this makes for a very entertaining, fast-paced read.  It would be hard not to like this book.	2001-09-17

Rule has been obsessed by the memory of their brief romance, and when Cathryn finally returns to the ranch as a young widow, he is determined to have her and won't take no for an answer.

Not only does Harold Schechter skillfully tell the story of Ed Gein's infamous crimes, but he also successfully puts the tale in the proper historical and sociological context. In order to understand the deviant Gein became, you have to understand the bleak society and loveless home he came from. His crimes are certainly shocking and unforgiveable, but it's hard not to see Gein as a pathetic figure. The oppressively lonely and essentially passive man Schechter portrays is hardly consistent with the horror story villains based on his story. I appreciated Schechter's research into and explanation of the studies that were done of Gein during his lifetime incarceration in forensic psychological wards. The author does a particularly good job of explaining the subtleties of legal insanity and how Gein could be considered sane enough to be tried but still be found criminally insane.	2001-09-16

The best writer of contemporary romances proves that she is still at the top of her game in &quot;This Little Heart of Mine.&quot; Susan Elizabeth Phillips plays matchmaker for two characters from some of her previous popular novels: Molly Somerville (Phoebe's little sister from &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;) and Kevin Tucker (the Star's backup quarterback from &quot;Nobody's Baby but Mine&quot;). Molly is all grown up and is supporting herself as an author of children's books. Problem is, her personal life is non-existent. Kevin is now the Stars' superstar quarterback, but he hasn't allowed himself to have much of a life outside of football. Both are feeling restless and dissatisfied, and when they accidentally spend a weekend together, the results are disastrous. Kevin comes away thinking that Molly is a flat-out kook, and Molly is left emotionally battered. Thanks to some more unusual circumstances, they end up running a bed and breakfast Kevin has most unwillingly inherited. OK, so far this all sounds like nonsense, but trust me, Phillips makes it work. The characters are richly drawn and quite charming. Not only does SEP add a lot of humor (you will laugh out loud), but she also creates a wonderfully tender and sweet romance that manages to avoid being sappy and cloying. I was particularly impressed with the way she was able to intertwine Molly's children's books into the narrative without making them annoying distractions. If you only buy one contemporary romance this year, this should be the one.	2001-09-16

Even though there are exceptions, the idea of the career oriented secretary starting an affair with the hard driving executive has sort of faded out in these times of sexual harrassment and hostile work environments. Nevertheless, if you consider it a bit of a period piece, you'll find this a delightful read. Rome is a sexy, aggressive business man who tragically lost his wife and two young sons in a car crash. A couple of years later he is still deeply grieving, but circumstances force him to spend some time with Sarah, his wife's former best friend and a beautiful co-worker that he has always found attractive. Sarah has long carried a secret torch for Rome, and despite her reservations she is privately thrilled when Rome starts pursing her. Rome obviously has some deep emotional issues to address, and Sarah's patient understanding and loving support allow him to work out those issues. At the same time, Rome's forceful personality help push her out of her cool reserve. The biggest hurdle facing them is that Sarah would love to have Rome's baby, but he is unable to tolerate the thought of another child. There's not much plot here, but the relationship is very intense and manages to carry the book quite nicely on its own. A very satisfying book that you can read again and again.	2001-08-28

It is the story of Bernie Root, the oldest daughter of a military family constantly on the move from one air force base to another. Bernie is returning to her family stationed in Okinawa after her first year at college and her first experience away from her tightly knit family. She worries that the changes she's made will alienate her from her family. Her proper plaid skirts and blouses with peter pan collars have been replaced by faded and patched blue jeans and a sloppy shirt. The Vietnam War is raging, and she has joined a campus protest group - quite the rebellion for the daughter of an air force officer. After their reunion, Bernie is shocked to find that it is her family that has changed almost beyond recognition, not her. Her formerly glamorous and vivacious mother is practically paralyzed with depression, her usually gung ho father expresses disgust with the Vietnam war, and the affection between her parents has disappeared. In order to discover what went wrong, she must revisit her childhood and uncover painful secrets from the family's past. Sarah Bird was a military brat herself, and in many ways this book is a nostalgic look at that lifestyle during the 1960s. She deftly portrays both the exaggerated family interdependence and the lack of other personal ties that result from a childhood on the move. The characters in the &quot;Yokota Officers Club&quot; are exceptionally well drawn. Bernie, Moe, Kit and Bobby in particular seem to come to life and jump off the page. Bird successfully combines all of these elements into a very touching story. While this book was not as funny as Bird's previous work, in many ways it is more compelling. I thought that the ending was particularly daring. There's no neat resolution, just a resigned acceptance of what happened in the past.	2001-08-27

In order to achieve this delicate balance, an author must carefully review the voluminous historical record and cull the mundane and marginally relevant details from those that provide real interest and insight. I can't speak authoritatively on the subject, but it is clear that Giles MacDonogh has exhaustively studied the life of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Both original sources in the form of personal letters and first hand accounts and later critical examinations of Wilhelm are well represented. Unfortunately, while this book may be a scholarly success, it is not a particularly good read. The subject is compelling, but MacDonogh's pedantic rendition never fully engages the lay reader. Wilhelm is one of the most contradictory and controversial leaders of the 2th century, but this book never really gives you a sense of his personality or his relationships with others. Instead of really delving into the heart and soul of his subject, MacDonogh produces a dry litany of historical facts. The only personal aspect of the kaiser that MacDonogh tries to address in any depth is his anti-semitism, but even here he is not completely successful.	2001-08-26

Nevertheless, Rowling's writing skills have clearly matured. Her unparalleled imagination is still at work, but she has added subtle nuances that make her characters even more interesting.

Having re-read this book for the first time in two decades, I have no trouble understanding why it is a staple of high school literature classes everywhere. It's a great book for teaching symbolism, foreshadowing and some of the themes of the romantic movement. However, as an adult, I pretty much found it to be an excruciating reading experience, and I'm not just talking about the fact that the language is dense and dreary. The very things that make it a valuable teaching tool can be very annoying to a more experienced reader. As I was reading I kept wanting to scream every time Hawthorne talked about the scarlet letter burning, glowing or being like a painful brand. I got it already! I can put up with slogging through the nineteenth century prose if I'm going to be challenged a little, but this book no longer did it for me.	2001-08-25

However, my reaction to the story was different than when I first read it in high school. I recall that back then I was hoping that Daisy and Gatsby's love story would ultimately yield a happy ending. Now, I found them both to be such shallow creatures that they inspired no pity. While I considered the characters to be emotionally stunted, that dooesn't mean I was not impressed with Fitzergerald's skillful rendering. As in most forms of art, in literature it is more difficult to accurately and interestingly portray nothingness than to describe a richly endowed subject. At this more cynical age, I found Daisy to be a remarkable emotional void, and Gatsby's quest to pour all of his hopes and dreams into such a shallow cauldron only confirmed his own vapidity. One thing that hasn't changed in all these years is my amazement at Fitzgerald's ability to set a scene. His descriptive passages are truly poetic, and his command of word choice in unparalleled. All this made for a stimulating and delightful read.	2001-08-25

It is important to keep in mind while reading this book that it is an anecdotal account of one layman's recovery from severe depression.  The major theme of the book is a sound one - a depressive must take control of his own recovery.  The author has done some research on the medical issues, and there are several helpful suggestions throughout the book.  He is most adept at setting forth a plan of how to get through a day-to-day recovery.  Making a daily task list and getting out and interacting with other people are good cooping mechanisms and give a depressive concrete goals to accomplish.  However, the book won't speak to everyone.  This is basically a 12 step program for depression.  Like most 12 step programs it includes a spiritual element of discovering a &quot;higher power&quot;.   If this is not something that is right for you, you will find this book of limited utility.  It begins with a lengthy discussion of the variety of religions and personal growth movements the author has dabbled in.  Some will find it helpful, others will be put off by it.  It is the nature of such anecdotal accounts that some readers will be able to relate to the author's experience and find it incredibly useful while others are not particularly moved.  Nevertheless, even those who can't buy into the whole program will find valuable suggestions for dealing with depression.	2001-08-19

Susan Elizabeth Phillips is known for her combination of humor and romance, and this book doesn't disappoint.  I laughed so hard that I cried during the first 100 pages.  This is the story of Lady Emma Wells-Finch, the very proper headmistress of a girl's school in England.  She is visiting Texas to do some research on a book, and decides that this is the perfect opportunity to ruin her spotless reputation (something that is necessary to save the school for reasons that are rather implausible).  Her friend Francesa Beaudine has persuaded Kenny Travers, a star golf pro currently banned from the PGA tour, to act as her chauffer and guide.  Kenny is drop dead gorgeous (think Pierce Bronson) and has a quirky sense of humor.  He plays on the fact that Emma has no idea who is and actually persuades her that his escort services are comprehensive - for a fee.  Emma seizes the opportunity to play the bad girl and hires him for the night.  Up until this point, the book  is absolutely hilarious.  While it remains funny (Kenny's sister is particularly amusing), it then takes a more serious turn as Emma travels to Kenny's home and helps him struggle with the ghosts from his past.  This is where I had a little trouble with the narrative.  Kenny is supposedly a decent, hardworking man who encourages everyone that he is an obnoxious oaf.  Huh?  Believe it or not, Phillips almost makes it work.  In any event it provides the background for a very sweet romance between Kenny and Emma.  This isn't SEP's best, but it's still a very enjoyable read.  P.S.  It'll be interesting to see what she comes up with for Teddy Beaudine.	2001-08-19

Considering that emotional intensity is pretty much the hallmark of romance novels, that is saying a lot.  It is the story of Cat Cochran, a very talented but struggling professional photographer, and Travis Danvers, a wealthy designer of superior sailboats.  Both are emotionally damaged - she by a wealthy but brutal ex-husband and he by a money-grubbing woman who manipulated a pregnancy in hopes of financial gain.  The two accidentally meet and are immediately attracted to one another even though each has similarities to the person that traumatized the other in the past.  Cat has not been paid by her some of her most important customers and is valiantly struggling to bring in enough money to support herself and her glomming family.  Travis wants to make her his mistress and put a price on their relationship.  He can't relax unless they've agreed upon a financial settlement.  Also, Cat is working so hard that she is physically exhausted and doesn't have much time for him.  Cat, of course, is wary of any financial dependence and isn't about to sell herself.  Despite their inability to come to understanding, they begin a fervent relationship that surprises both of them.  Naturally, all is not smooth sailing, and they both are placed in positions where they must confront and overcome their emotional demons.<br />Both characters are very appealing.  Travis comes off as a very realistic modern-day pirate type, and I was particularly able to relate to the way Cat balanced her physical exhaustion with her need to be with Travis.  Lowell does an amazing job of conveying that state where you are overwhelmed with responsibilities but are still giddily excited about a new relationship.  There isn't a lot of plot to this story - no mystery to solve or evil third party trying to drive the two apart.  The sole focus of the book is the relationship, and it packs a powerful punch.  A great read for romance fans.	2001-08-19

Louis de Bernieres has written a daring mixture of fiction, history, romance, classical mythology, travel log and cookbook.  This is essentially the story of the Italian and German occupation of a Greek Island, Cephalonia, during World War II.  Books about World War II - be they novels, historical studies or first-hand accounts - have been hugely popular in the US, but the course of the war in Greece will be new and interesting territory for many readers.  I understand that there has been some criticism of de Bernieres' historical research, especially as regards the partisan resistance, but this book certainly whetted my appetite to learn more about what happened in Greece.  <br />The plot itself revolves around Pelagia, the beautiful daughter of Dr. Iannis, the local physician and village elder.  Pelagia initially becomes enamored of Mandras, a local fisherman.  Her powerful initial attraction keeps her from noticing that he is not her intellectual equal, an oversight that evetually leads to disillusionment and tragedy for both of them.  Meanwhile, the Italians arrive to occupy the island.  A handsome young musician, Captain Correlli, is boarded in the Iannis household.  The doctor and his daughter do there best to show their solidarity with Greece by making the Captain as uncomfortable as possible, but they are inevitably seduced by his wit, intelligence and zest for life.  <br />The story is beautifully written.  Not only does de Bernieres do justice to the beautiful island setting, but he also powerfully conveys the misery and hardship of the fighting on the front lines.  All the classic themes of a great war novel are here - the unique brotherhood of fighting men, the conundrum of fighting against men you personal like and respect, the lure of brutality.  The plot is interwoven with Homerian references as well.  The large cast of characters are masterfully executed.  The narrative is told from several different points of view.All in all, a tour de force by de Bernieres.  I know that many people found the ending unsatisfying, but consider the parallels between Correlli and Ohysseus.	2001-08-18

It is the story of Honey Moon, a young girl from a rough background who rather accidentally finds herself the star of a TV show.  The romance in the book is generally pretty good, but the more interesting part of the book is Honey's growth from a tough, unloved girl, to an emotionally dependent wife, to an independent and fully mature woman.   As usual, Susan Elizabeth Phillips is adept at adding touches of humor and creating interesting, multi-dimensional characters.  It's a good read.  Nevertheless, if you're reading it just for the romance, you will find it only marginally satisfying.	2001-08-18

All of Schone's trademarks are here - an emotionally intense relationship, sensual erotica, historical accuracy - and they make for a compelling read.  Schone stumbles a bit in spending too much time trying to make her premise plausible and developing a mystery plot that is not terribly interesting.  Nevertheless, when she focuses on the core relationship, this book is nearly as good as any she has written and will be a delight for fans of her work.  A word of warning:  Schone's love scenes can be very graphic.  If that makes you uncomfortable, this book is not for you.	2001-08-18

Sure enough, this is a children's book that appeals just as much to adults as to children of all ages.  J.K. Rowling has successfully woven together all sortsof cultural icons, myths and legends and created a wonderfully appealing world inhabited by dragons, vampires, unicorns, griffins, trolls, witches, centaurs, warlocks, ghosts and giants.  Its a place that will appeal to any child's imagination, and adults will be impressed with Rowling's blend of reality and fantasy.<br />Harry Potter is an engaging lead character.  He is an outcast at home who discovers he is famous in a world he never knew existed.  He's clever but modest, loyal to his friends but not above holding a grudge against those who deserve it, brave in the face of danger but scared of failure.  The secondary characters are broadly drawn, but subtlety would be misplaced in this forum.  They are by turns outrageous, humorous, frightening and silly.  If only people in the real world were so easily classified!<br />In many ways &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a long introduction to the entire series.  The first half of the book basically consists of introducing Harry, explaining the world of magic, and describing life at Hogwart, the boarding school for budding witches and warlocks.  The plot doesn't begin to coalesce until about two thirds into the book and then it moves quickly and its filled with thrilling adventures.  Parents, you may be buying this book for your kids, but don't miss out on this great read yourself!	2001-08-14

When most of us think of the daughter's of Queen Victoria, we think of the tragedy wrought throughout the royal families of Europe by the hemophiliac gene passed by the queen's female descendents.   &quot;Victoria's Daughters&quot; amply proves that there is much more to learn about these 5 fascinating and very different women.  Jerrold Packard explores their lives from cradle to grave and offers much insight into how their formative years shaped the destiny of modern Europe.  Victoria and her husband Albert raised their elder daughters with the expectation that they would marry into other royal families and help spread their father's conception of a constitutional monarchy across the Continent.  Despite (or perhaps because of) their earnest efforts, quite the opposite happened.  In many ways, the younger daughters had an even more difficult task.  They were expected to devote their lives to the service of their demanding widowed mother and each had to struggle for a measure of independence, including the right to marry.  All five did eventually marry and several bred offspring that would rule throught the courts of Europe in the early 20th century.<br />Packard is an adept historical biographer, and he skillfully compares and contrasts the lives of the 5 daughters.  His research has been extensive.  Given the voluminous correspondence between Victoria and her daughters, this was no doubt a daunting task.  However,  he frequently opines as to what any one of the daughters was thinking in response to a given incident; it is difficult todistinguish which come from  his suppositions and which are based upon actual statements in the historical records.  In the same vein, Packard tends to state his congectures about how the daughters might have changed history as given facts.  For example, he is quite definitive in stating that if Vicki had been less demanding of &quot;Willy&quot; (Kaiser Wilhelm II) during his childhood, the course of the 20th centrury would have been drastically different.  While that might be true, there's also reason to believe that Willy's mental instability and Bismark's political maneuvering would have yield the same results regardless.  Nevertheless,  this is a thoroughly readable and very enlightening book.	2001-08-12

I was fascinated and amazed by the story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis when I read Doug Stanton's recently released book on the topic, &quot;In Harm's Way.&quot;   If you've read Stanton's book, you will find that even though it covers the same topic as this one, the two books are not duplicative.  There is little overlap in the survivors interviewed by Thomas Helm for &quot;Ordeal by Sea&quot; and those interviewed by Stanton.  Consequently, reading both books gives you a more complete picture of this poignant historical tragedy.   The story is an amazing one - 317 men surviving in the open water for 4 days during the closing days of the war in the pacific.   It is a tale of unimaginable horrors and incredible bravery.  Helm's narrative can be rather choppy, but the variety of first-hand accounts in the book are a valuable contribution to the historical record.	2001-08-12

If you're a fan of Linda Howard's (and if you're not, you should be), you will find &quot;Open Season&quot; to be a satisfying read even though it doesn't offer anything new.  If fact, I thought this book was VERY similar to Howard's &quot;Dream Man&quot; without the psychic elements. But hey, &quot;Dream Man&quot; was a great book, so a repeat isn't completely uncalled for.<br />The core story is about a small-town librarian, Daisy Minor, who wakes up on her 34th birthday and realizes that her hair is boring, her clothes are boring, her job is boring, she's boring.  Not to mention lonely.  Daisy decides that if she doesn't want to spend her life alone, she needs to get busy, and the fastest way to get results is to do a complete make-over into a &quot;party&quot; girl.  Sure enough, there is a beautiful, sexy woman under all her frowsiness.  Before she even starts her transformation, she butts heads with the new police chief,  Jack Russo, an apparent fish-out-of-water Yankee in this sleepy southern berg.  He's big, he's intimidating, he's rude.  He's also very sexy .  As Daisy ventures out to strut her new stuff at the local bars, he becomes concerned that she's way too naive to realize when she's attracted the wrong kind of attention.  Daisy  wants him to get out of her way so she can continue her man hunt.  Dane - I mean Jack - decides that he needs to stick close for her own protection.  Then he decides that he just needs to stick close.  Somewhere along the way there's a crime to solve and Daisy becomes a target for bad guys.  Which means, of course, that Daisy and Jack need to have some hot love scenes.<br />Howard's unique style and humor are evident throughout the book.  Daisy's schemes to get the word out that she's available are hysterical, and you will never see colored condoms in the same light.  Both of the lead characters are appealing, but Daisy is the more finely drafted of the two.  Her ernest attempts to be a party girl are charming.  I particularly appreciated that she isn't one of those ninny romantic heroines who has to go do something foolish that she's been warned not to do in order to prove how independent and spirited she is.  In fact, when Jack thinks she's left a safe haven he's found for her, she lets him have it.   Her response:  &quot;I'm safe here; why would I leave?  That's what always happens in movies; either the woman or the kid disobeys instructions and does exactly what they've been told not to do, thereby putting both themselves and everyone else in danger.  I've always thought that if they were that stupid, then let them die before they have a chance to breed.&quot;  Hallelujah!<br />The mystery plot is good, but the romance is better.  The secondary characters are well-developed, especially the bad guys.  All in all, this is a quick read, but a good one.	2001-08-10

This book focuses on Victoria's personal relationship with her family, her ministers and her staff.  Given her extraordinary long life, there is a lot of material to cover.  I was particularly interested in Victoria's contentious early relationship with her mother and the way the young queen was so successful in establishing her independence from the forces that hoped to use her as a tool for their personal ambitions.  Equally fascinating was her relationship with Albert, the Prince Consort.  Victoria's long widowhood and deification of her husband's memory is well-known.  Her infamous grief has overshadowed Albert's real accomplishments and contributions to her reign.  Hibbert also paints an in-depth portrait of Victoria's difficult relationships with her many children.  After reading the book I impressed both with the queen's obvious charm and intelligence and equally appalled by her selfishness.  In many ways Victoria's contradictory character shaped the world for nearly a decade.  Hibbert has done an excellent job of portraying all facets of Victoria's life and written an entertaining and highly readable book.	2001-08-06

On the surface, this book appears to be similar to recent spateof humorous novels about contemporary young single women struggling to find their place in the world (&quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot;, &quot;The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing&quot;, &quot;Until the Real Thing Comes Along&quot; - just to name a few).  While this book is frequently as funny as the others, it has a much more serious side.  &quot;Welcome to my Planet&quot; is really about a young woman trying to work through a serious depression.  Shannon, the main character, has reached adulthood without any real ambitions beyond a vague desire to marry and have someone take care of her.   Since she's still struggling to figure out how to have a relationship, she more or less falls into graduate school and starts building a future career despite herself.   Olson writes some very funny dialouge, but the humor is incidental to the character's struggle for emotional maturity and stability.

When I first read this book 4 years ago, it was the first time I'd read a contemporary romance and I became a huge fan of both the genre and of Linda Howard.  Only a great book could change my tastes in reading material, and this one certainly qualified.  I re-read it recently and was just as impressed as I was the first time.  This book has it all - great characters, sizzling sexual tension and an entertaining plot.  <br />The heroine, Marlie Keen, is an empathic psychic who starts seeing horrific murders through the eyes of the murderer.  Dane Hollister, a detective investigating the murders, is fiercely attracted to Marlie despite his reservations about her psychic abilities.  Thanks to her past experiences reading others' emotions, Marlie is extremely wary of her own intense emotional reaction to Dane.  As the two work together together to solve the murders, sparks start to fly.  The romance that follows is compelling.  Like Dane, I'm not someone who would buy the whole psychic thing in real life, but Howard makes it work in this book.  Both characters are wonderfully developed.  This is a great read for all readers, not just romance fans.	2001-08-03

Susan Elizabeth Phillips' fans have come to expect first-rate romances with enganging characters and lots of humor.  &quot;First Lady&quot; certainly delivers on those fronts, but it is nonetheless an intriguing change for this leader in contemporary romance.  The plot is a difficult one, and I can't imagine any other author handling it so well.  It's actually a pretty complex plot, but Phillips does an excellent job of bringing the details all together and keeping the plot flowing.  The heart of the story is the relationship between First Lady in disguise Nealy Case and rugged Mat Jorik, a burnt out journalist struggling to find a home for the daughters of his recently deceased ex-wife.  Not only does Phillips plausibly bring these two soulmates together, but she also manages to introduce a wonderful cast of secondary characters.  The romance alternates from steamy to incredibly sweet and touching.  This is an excellent read and lots of fun.	2001-07-31

Like most stitchers, I've used &quot;the Black Book&quot; for years.  The new edition is a must-have for anyone who does needlepoint.  All the good stuff you've used in the past is still there - lessons on how to begin, the tools of the trade, hundreds of stitches and how to use them, and fnishing instructions.  Part of the reason that Christensen has been such a universally used resource is that her step-by-step instructions on how to do different stiches are easy to follow. As wonderful as the old edition was, this new one is even better.  Not only are there more stiches - and very useful ones - but the information on tools and materials has been drastically revised.  One of the most significant changes that caught my attention is that unlike the previous edition, Christensen is now recommending routine use of frames.   Of course, this is consistent with what most of us have been doing for years.  Christensen makes some general observations about the new types of threads available and how to use them, but she doesn't discuss them in detail.  This is probably a wise choice since the vast variety of threads has been constantly changing and will no doubt continue to do so.  My one complaint is that when selecting projects to show in the book, Christensen has very deliberately chosen to drastically limit the number of projects that have holiday themes, particularly Christmas.  This seems like a strange choice since you only have to walk in to any needlepoint shop to know that Christmas projects make up the bulk of the business.  Other holidays, including those of different religions and traditions are also popular.  Personally, I almost never stitch anything but Christmas stockings and ornaments, and most stitchers I know are the same.   Other than this personal bias, however, I have found the new edition to be an excellent improvement on an already great book.	2001-07-16

Karen Karbo is a very funny writer, and she uses her humorous outlook to lighten the discussion of this very difficult and often painful subject.  Most every adult is either divorced, in a relationship with someone who is divorced or has friends that are divorced.  Learning to cope with ex's and their children is a skill most of us have had to learn.  Karbo's take on this is often dead-on.  The most helpful advice that she gives throughout the book is that it is imperative that an ex-couple's children not be used as pawns in their parent's emotional battle.  She accurately identifies all the subtle ways this is done by even the most consciously well-meaning parent.  If you're newly divorced or about to divorce and worried about how to minimize the trama on the kids, read this book.  I was particularly impressed by how well Karbo followed her own advice - you won't see her bashing her ex-husband in the slightest way in this book. <br />While Karbo's advice on how to handle children is very useful, I wasn't so taken with her advice about dating divorced men and women.  Karbo tells amusing stories from her own life, particularly ones about Carol the ex-wife of her live-in-boyfriend Matthew.  Carol is insane.  Years after the divorce, she continues to haunt Matthew's life with constant phone calls and blatant manipulation of their child.  While the stories are so outrageous they are often very funny, you can't help but feel that there is a certain pathos in poking fun at this woman's pain.  Also, I couldn't help but lose some respect for Karbo's ability to give wothwhile  advice on this subject since she continued to put up with episodes like having all her underwear torn up and other outlandish behavior.  Note to all women dating divorced men:  if  he still talks to his ex-wife about anything other than congenial conversations about the welfare of their children, run for the hills.  No exceptions.  This is a sign that the relationship is still on-going and not likely to stop anytime soon.  Even screaming fights are a sign that both parties are still way too emotionally involved, even if it's in a negative way.  While it may be easy to blame the ex-wife, as Karbo does throughout most of this book, the fact is that it takes two to tango - if your boyfriend didn't reward the behavior in some way, it wouldn't still be going on. <br />A couple of quick issues Karbo doesn't address:  When you're dating a divorced parent, you're dating the children too.  If you've gotten close to the children, breaking up with the parent has emotional consequences for them.  In other words, unless you're thinking there is likely a future in the relationship, watch yourself with the kids.  Next point:  if you do chose to marry or get seriously involved with a divorced parent, you have limited rights to complain about the kids.  No matter how hostile or ill-mannered they may be, you are the one who chose to enter their world; they didn't chose you.  Yes, you do get to set certain broad parameters of acceptable behavior in your home, but just remember that you're the one who asked to be there, not them.	2001-07-16

This amazing collection of first-hand accounts of the survivors of the Bataan Death March is brutal but compelling reading.  Donald Knox has interviewed an extensive collection of survivors and persuaded them to tell the excruciating details of their capture, their time in the camps and on work details and their release.   Their stories are alternately shocking and inspiring.  The book is an invaluable historical resource, and any student of the war in the Pacific will find it fascinating reading.  Since it is presented as a collection of interviews from different sources, some familiarity with the story of Bataan and American POWs in Japan will help the reader place each story in the right context.  These testimonials can be gruesome, but it's important that the POWs' stories be told.	2001-07-15

All of her trademark elements are here - witty dialogue, amuzing secondary characters, a hot romance.  This is the story of a small town art teacher, Quinn McKenzie, who adopts a stray dog and decides to finally take control of her life.  She breaks up with the steady but dull school coach, gets her own place and tries to initiate a romance with her ex-brother-in-law and close friend, Nick.  The problem is that the rest of the town thinks she lost her mind.  The coach refuses to accept their break-up and her boss blames her for the team's loosing streak and threatens to fire her.  Inspired by Quinn's new attitude, her Mom comes out of the closet and her  best friend leaves her happy but unexciting 20 year marriage.  As if things are bad enough, Nick refuses to sleep with her!  There's one amusing plot twist after the other, and the dialogue is priceless.   One of the things I love best about Crusie's novels is the way she makes the lives of ordinary people - Quinn is a teacher and Nick is an automechanic - funny, exciting, sexy and romantic.  This is a great novel that you will read again and again, laughing all the while.	2001-07-15

Even though I found that this book packed a heavy emotionally wallop and I couldn't get it off my mind for days after I read it, it is difficult for me to explain how such a simple plot could be so compelling.  Early one morning a pilot's wife, Kathryn, is awakened by a representative from the pilot's union coming to tell her that her husband's transatlantic flight blew up in mid-air.  There are no survivors.  Shreve does a remarkable job of portraying the initial stages of her grief and the complex effect the crash has on her relationship with her teenage daughter.   As Kathryn is struggling to coming to grips with the fact that her husband is irrevocably gone, the cockpit flight recorders are discovered and suggest that her husband was somehow responsible for the catastrophe.  Kathryn is certain that her husband was not suicidal, but as she begins to sort through his belongings, she relizes how little she really knew him.  Her husband regularly piloted a flight to London, and she goes there to investigate what he was doing the night before the fatal crash.  I won't reveal any more, but as you read the book you will not be the least bit surprised at what she discovers.  Even knowing where the story was leading, the emotional impact I felt upon her discovery was shocking.  The moral of the story is a simple one, but Shreve's masterful writing makes learning the lesson a very intense experience.	2001-07-14

Stephanie Bond is known as a romance writer, but this novel would barely qualify for the genre.  It's more of a mystery with a big dose humor thrown in.  It's the story of three very different women who meet in the Raymond Carmichael's hospital room.  The problem is that each of these women thinks she's Raymond's wife.  Raymond is murdered shortly thereafter, and his three wives are the chief suspects.  Each of the wives are very different, and you will find Ruby absolutely hilarious.  The interaction among the three is always amusing.  Mystery buffs may be dismayed that there are so many implausible and unexplained coincidences; you have to just accept that this is just a fluffy, fun adventure. This is a nice, light read, but don't expect a romance novel or a true mystery.	2001-07-14

When Worth Lansing's girlfriend cancels just as they are about to leave for a trip to Acapulco, he brings along Cyn McCall, a close friend and the young widow of his best friend.  When the two arrive in Acapulco, they discover that the resort is booked and they can't change Worth's reservations for a romantic, one-bed villa.  Sure enough, the sexual tension starts to build because of the setting and close proximity.  Are they willing to risk years of close friendship by pursuing a possible affair?   This is obviously one of Brown's earlier works, but her characters are well-developed and the romance moves along nicely.  There's more humor than you usually find in Brown's novels which is refreshing.  Nevertheless, the heroine is a little too neurotic for my tastes, and I personally didn't care for the simplistic and pollyannaish anti-abortion statement in one of the subplots (thus the three star rating - I don't care what the author's political views are, but don't use them to muck up my romance), but otherwise this was a very enjoyable light read.	2001-07-14

If you're not familiar with Bertrice Small's books and are likely to be offended by graphic [love] scenes, this is not the book for you.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  Personally, I generally enjoy Small's books because of the way she really tries to interweave her plot with actual history and because she creates such vivid and strong characters.  Believe me, there are no shrinking violets in this book.  Here, Hugh, the male lead, is ordered to marry Isabelle by the king.  In the beginning of the book, Belle is more of a spoiled brat than a hellion.  Hugh is an unusual but likable hero.  He isn't handsome, but he is kind and loyal.  Through a lot of plot twists, Hugh loses his memory and is more or less enslaved by a sorceress.  Belle comes to rescue him but becomes equally enslaved to the sorceress' brother.  Belle fairly willingly becomes his [love] slave while Hugh is busy with the sister.  Things only get weirder from there.  One of the things I liked best about the book was that once Hugh and Belle get away from the kinky duo, they don't automatically blissfully reunite.  They actually have a lot of emotional baggage to work through - a nice realistic touch as opposed to the pat romance novel ending.	2001-07-08

No dout about it - there are more cookie recipes in this book than you are likely to find anywhere else.  You'll find some exotic offerings as well as traditional home baked cookies.  My problem with this book, however, is that it doesn't tell you anything about the recipes; it just lists the ingredients and gives you the baking instructions.  This is especially frustrating when there are multiple recipes listed for a certain kind of cookie.  For example, there are 5 recipes for &quot;Ginger Cookies&quot;, but no description of what distinguishes each.  Yes, I can read that they have slightly different ingredients, but I want the author to tell me what is special about each recipe.  For example, which one produces a crisper cookie,  which one has a longer shelf life, which has the most intense ginger flavor?  Also, there appear to be some traditional international recipes here, but there is no explanation of the origin or tradition about the cookies.  Finally, the same recipes seem to appear again and again with slightly different names and shapes.  I think you'd be hard pressed to say that there are 1001 unique cookie recipes in this book.	2001-07-06

There's a reason that &quot;Lord of Scoundrels&quot; is near the top if everyone romance reader's list of favorite books.  Loretta Chase has written one fabulous regency romance.  Jessica Trent is determined to pry her nitwit brother away from the notoriously corrupt influence of the Marquess of Dain.  However, once she meets Dain she is mature enough to admit that there is an obvious physical attraction between them.  Dain also recognizes the attraction, but he is determined to avoid doing anything about it.   Dain had a particularly painful childhood, and he is convinced that he is such a flawed person that no one could ever ruly care for him.  That's why he's buried himself in the world of vice.  Since the two keep running into one another and since both want to discourage the other's advances, they each set out to destroy the other's reputation.  Dain thinks he'll have an easy job of it - afterall, merely being seen in his presence is enough to cause a scandal.  However, as Jessica cleverly points out, because he is publically seeking her out and clearly displaying his interest in her, he is actually ruining his own reputation as a heartless rake.  These scenes are amusing and emotionally intense by turns.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but you will be amazed at what Jessica does to get Dain to marry her.  That is only half of the story, however.  The rest involves the two of them trying to figure one another out and settle into the meaningful relationship that they both want .  This is a great read from cover to cover - enjoy!	2001-07-03

The books in Elizabeth Lowell's &quot;Only&quot; series (to which &quot;Winter Fire&quot; is loosely related) are the best of the western romance genre, and &quot;Winter Fire&quot; amply proves this point.  This is the story of Sarah Kennedy, a young woman who had to sell herself into marriage at the age of 16 to an abusive old man in order to support herself and her brother.  After becoming a widow, Sarah continues to try to support herself, her brother and a few other strays she has picked up in the harsh Utah territory.  One of her friends brings her Case Maxwell, a Civil War veteran seeking vengence against the Culpeppers, a rogue clan that tortured and murdered the young members of his family during the war.  When Sarah meets Case, he has been badly shot in a showdown with some of the Culpeppers, and she nurses him back to health.  Case has been  so emotionally taumatized by what happened to his nieces and nephews that he has completely shut down emotionally.  Much to his disgust, he finds himself becoming attracted to Sarah.  Sarah's horrible experience with her dead husband made her disgusted with men and sex, and she also does not welcome the attraction she feels for Case.  The two struggle to build a relationship while continuing to fight the Culpeppers and while searching for silver Sarah hopes will guarantee her future.  Lowell deftly handles the emotional drama in this story, not to mention sexual tension, without making all the characters so angst ridden that their eventual emotional reconciliation isn't believeable.	2001-07-01

The story of the liberation of the American POWs in Cabanatuan is wonderfully recounted by Hampton Sides.  Sides has clearly done excellent research, both looking at the documentary records and conducting interviews of key participants.  While the book is about the liberation of these survivors of the Bataan Death March, Hampton does an excellent job of including the history of the surrender of Bataan, the March and the harrowing years the in the POW camps.  Chapters focusing on a horrifying element of the POWs' internment alternate with chapters about the Rangers plotting their amazing plan to free them.  As you learn more about the blight of the POWs, you increasingly feel the same urgency the Rangers must have felt about achieving a successful raid.   Throughout the book, Sides shows the heroism of the POWs and the Rangers.  No reader will come away from this book without a profound sense admiration for the surviving POWs, an enormous respect for the bravery and skill of their rescuers and overwhelming sympathy and grief for those who did not return.  <br />One word of caution: the prologue tells the story of the gruesome massacre of American POWs by the Japanese at Palawan.  I think this is an important part of the book not only because this story should be told, but also because it explains the urgency of the Ranger's mission to liberate the camp at Cabanatuan.  Nevertheless, the details of this massacre are so astoundingly cruel and gruesome that they may seriously disturb some readers.  I gave the book to a friend who was so upset by the prolouge that he was unable to finish the book.  I do think it's important to read the story of Palawan, but if you are that sensitive, skip the prolouge and go straight into the main text.  Unfortunately, there will be  plenty of horrifying episodes in the text, but none as gruesome as the massacre at Palawan.	2001-06-30

This book is about Queen Victoria's unusual relationship with her highland servant, John Brown.  Most are familiar with the story because of the well-received movie, &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;.  While the story made a very interesting movie, for most recreational readers the topic doesn't merit  a full book.  Raymond Lamont-Brown has certainly done excellent research, and I do not doubt that his account of Mr. Brown and his relationship with the queen is as accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, oneof Queen Victoria's daughters drastically edited the Queen's personal papers when it came to the topic of Mr. Brown, so much of the historical record is irretrievably lost.  Nevertheless,  it seems clear that it is unlikely that there was a scandalous relationship and that the Queen simply considered Mr. Brown to be a completely devoted servant .  She consequently kept him in constant attendance and was tolerant of his brusque manner.  No matter how hard Mr. Lamont-Brown tries to find some actual drama, most of the relationship (and therefore most of the book) revoloved around the mundane routine of the royal household - daily ponyrides, picnics in the Scottish countryside, below-stairs jealousies, etc.  Any excitement in the book is the result of speculation, not historical fact.  If you have a serious interest in Queen Victoria, you will find this book worthwhile.  Otherwise, see the movie.	2001-06-30

Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of the best writers of contemporary romance as is amply proven by &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; .  This is the story of Rachel Stone, the widow of  a TV evangelist whose greed and hypocrisy continue to haunt their former home, Salvation, North Carolina.  Rachel and her son Edward are truly destitute, and she returns to Salvation in search of some of her husband's ill-gotten gains.  In order to conduct her search, she must outwit the current occupant of her former home, the widower Gabe Bonner.  Gabe is still in such deep mourning for his lost wife and son, that he has completely closed down emotionally.  Circumstances bring Rachel and Gabe together, and much to their mutual surprise, their initial antipathy and wariness begins to awaken emotional feelings neither anticipated.  Their sparing matches are hysterical and Phillips does a wonderful job building the sexual tension between the two.<br />This is actually a two-for-one romance.  In addition to Rachel and Gabe's story, the book includes the romance of Gabe's brother Ethan and his secretary Kristy.  Ethan is a reformed sinner who became a pastor, the kind that sharply contrasts with Rachel's flamboyant dead husband.   Kristy has been a part of his life forever and clearly always had a crush on Ethan.  When Rachel comes to town, she inspires Kristy to make some changes in her life which completely throw Ethan's world into a tailspin,<br />This novel has a unique plot, wonderfully developed characters, and extremely amusing dialouge.  Even if you aren't a fan of contemporary romance, this is such a sweet and funny novel that you are bound to enjoy it.	2001-06-24

And then there is the world's most amazing dessert:  Triple Coconut Cream Pie.   I don't particularly care for coconut, but I'd walk miles for a bite of this marvel.  Whenever visitors come to town, we inevitably take them to the Dahlia Lounge and insist, no matter how loud their protests, that they at least try a bite.  Without fail, they, too, become converts.  Trust me on this.  Douglas' recipes are well-written and adapted for the home cook.  He does a great job of explaining off-beat ingredients and preparations.  Where appropriate, he even includes photos of how to tackle some of the more unusual preparations that make his recipes even easier to follow. <br />Point number two:  Not only does Douglas give you his best recipes in this book, but he has also written what should be considered a mandatory guidebook to visitors and newcomers to Seattle.  Douglas generously mentions most of the other great restaurants in town and tells you when to go and what to order.  His description of the local markets is so comprehensive, it should be mandatory reading for every new cook who comes to town.

There's no such thing as tabula rosa readers when it comes to this book.  Each reader inevitably comes to the story with their own religious beliefs and education.  This is the dilemma:  do you consider Anita Diamant's story to be a pure work of fiction inspired by a brief portion of Genesis or do you consider it to be an attempt to flesh-out that story?  Putting my own prejudices up front, I pretty much considered this to be a pure work of historical fiction - an imaginative story well grounded in historical research.  From this point of view, I consider the book to be a huge success.  Not only is it a compelling story, but it is also beautifully written.  The author gives us a rich and fascinating glimpse at her interpretation of two ancient cultures.  Given that much of the historical record (biblical or otherwise) does not elaborate upon the private lives of women and families, no one should be surprised that Diamant has created/altered/expanded upon these subjects.  I think she did an excellent job of creating and contrasting a unique society where women had their own rights and powers and the more traditionally accepted assumption that women were frequently powerless and vulnerable in early patriarcal society.  Whatever your own personal views, you are sure to find this a compelling and thought provoking read.	2001-06-23

What were this guy and his cronies doing, holding a beauty pagent in prisons around the country?  If you can suspend disbelief a little and get past this initial problem, you're actually going to find a very unusual and sweet romance.  I particularly liked the heroine.  This was a woman who admittedly made some very poor choices in her life, but she was smart enough to realize her mistakes and take advantage of an opportunity to change her life around.  Osborne has some fun with the mystery of the missing wife.  The sexual and emotional tension between the two lead characters is well done, and many readers will be surprised by the ending.	2001-06-21

If you have read and enjoyed Susan Johsnon's novels in the past, you are in for a treat.  If Johnson is a new author for you, this book is a good place to begin.  All the traditional Johnson elements are here - devastatingly handsome but tormented hero with the ultimate rake's reputation, an appealing heroine who is smart and independent, VERY steamy love scenes. thorough historical research that adds realism to the story.  I was particularly impressed with the Johnson's handling of this hero's tortured past - as the reader discovers his past his dissolute behaviour makes sense.  My one teeny tiny complaint is with the story's initial premise - the heroine wishes to become the hero's mistress so that her reputation will be ruined and she will therefore be left alone by her greedy relatives seeking to marry her off and gain access to her fortune.  After the plan is put into action and with no explantion the affair is actually kept quiet and she is launched into the ton as a great success.

The romance at the heart of the story has great emotional intensity and will be immensebly satsifying to romance readers.  What particularly impressed me with this book was Lowell's vivid description not only of the hazards and difficulties of frontier life, but I was also moved by the enormous difficulties for women on the frontier unlucky enough to be without reliable male protection.  Like the heroine in this story, Shannon, these women had to struggle with the common obstacles to survival while simultaneously protecting themselves in a relatively lawless land where single women were seen as fair game.  What was particularly nice about this novel is that Shannon was not looking for a man to help make her life easier; she will only surrender her independence for true love.  All in all, a very satisfying book.	2001-06-21

The book is a handy size for carrying along, so you can take advantage of the manuy great maps as you tour the area.  Spurrier warns you again and again that the only way to really get around LA is by car, but he does offer alternatives for those intimidated by the freeways and/or parking dilemma.  His selection of hotels and restaurants is broad - everything from Beverly Hills luxury to places with lots of attitude but not much polish.  In many ways, the rest of the book is an ideal primer for anyone moving to LA or planning to spend lots of time there.  Not only will you find a carefully selected list of recreational options, but you will also get helpful hints on when to go and how to get there.  There is a great section on what to do - and not to do - with children, but there is no mention of Disneyland.  Indicative, I think, of how this book is a true insider's guide to the city, not just a promotion for tourisim.	2001-05-30

The characters are one dimensional and the plot is too obvious.  Brett is a particularly unappealing hero.  I have no idea what the heroine was supposedly attracted to.  The one thing I did like about the book was the emotional reunion between the two leads where they try to figure out how to resume a their relationship despite their mistrust and guilt.  This intense scene is indicative of some of Howard's better work.  Basically, this is a semi-tolerable read if you are in serious Howard withdrawal, but most readers would be better served by picking one of her more mature works.	2001-05-30

Even though this is the second book in the series, I read it last and found it just as satisfying as all the others.  Nobody is doing Regency romances better today than Stephanie Laurens.  The plot of this book focused almost exclusively on the relationship between the two leads.  There was some sort of mystery plot surrounding the whole thing, but frankly I couldn't keep the cast of characters straight and didn't find it very interesting.  Not that it mattered.  The core relationship was more than enough to keep me entertained.  Unlike some of Laurens novels, the heroine in this book is a very level-headed, smart young woman.  As always, the Cynster lead was devastatingly sexy.  If we can't clone them in real life, at least Laurens has given us the next best thing - Cynster after Cynster.	2001-05-30

You don't have to know a thing about horse racing or even care about horses to love this book.  Laura Hillenbrand has written a book so good that it sets the gold standard for all racing histories and simultaneously transcends its subject and becomes a classic portrait of early 20th century America.  This is the story of the miraculous meeting of 4 uniquely self-made men - the exuberant owner, the mystical trainer and two colorful jockeys - and one less than promising racehorse.  Together they lived the greatest adventure in racing history.  Hillenbrand makes the technical minutia of racing interesting to the layman through wonderful anecdotes.  Not only will you learn the physical feats and tactical strategy a jockey must employ during a race, but you will also enjoy Hillenbrand's vivid description of the jockey's journeyman life.  The tale of Seabiscuit's rise from obscurity is filled with so many twists and turns that I don't want say to much about it, but suffice to say, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Be sure to read Hillenbrand's &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; at the end of the book.  The story of how she researched the book and the interviews she conducted is fascinating.  I don't care what Hillenbrand's next book is about - judging from how good this one was, I'll buy it sight unseen.	2001-05-30

Julie Garwood is a master of her craft, and &quot;The Bride&quot; is one of her masterpieces.  Think that all heroines in romance novels are sniveling ninnies?  Think again.  Jamie Kincaid is cabable, generous, funny and charming - and not in an annoying way.  You'll love the way she integrates herself into her husband's foreign Scottish household, not to mention the way she captivates his attentions.  Alex is the perfect example of the perfect leading man - a sexy, handsome alpha male waiting to share his life with the right woman.  I know it's a cliche, but you will laugh and you will cry as you read this novel.  I envy those of you who haven't read it yet.  You're in for a real treat.	2001-05-30

All of the Crusie trademarks are here in spades - witty dialouge, great leading characters, love scenes that manage to be both steamy and hilarious at the same time.  No one combines humor and romance better than Crusie.  No doubt about it, you will enjoy this book.  However, I must admit that as enjoyable as &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot; is, I think it is the weakest of Crusie's books.  The female lead's life is so out of control - Maddie thinks her husband is cheating on her and preparing to kidnap their child - that I found it a more than a little difficult to believe that she was able to start a romance with her long-lost high school fling.  I don't demand absolute plausibility in my romance novels, but this was just too much.  The secret of this book is engaging in a little willing suspension of disbelief and just appreciate the humor in watching Maddie cope with her increasing bizarre and frequently funny life.	2001-05-29

While interesting and entertaining, this should not be considered a definitive guide to daily life in Regency and Victorian England.  Kristine Hughes does a good job of giving the reader examples of historical writings on subjects such as etiquette and dress.  Nevertheless, these few anacdotal resources do not constitute authoritative evidence that this is actually how people behaved in their everyday life.  Just as a modern etiquette book reflects an idealized view of modern life rather than an accurate picture of how we really live, these original sources do not necessarily reflect the real lifestyles of the times.  So long as you keep this caveat in mind, you will find this a very entertaining and readable book.  The scope is extensive - everything from household appliances to travel to the various social institutions.  There are many topics that will peak your interest, but consider this to be just the starting point for your research.	2001-05-28

Dave Pelzer shares his horrific childhood at the hands of an insanely sadistic mother in this powerful memoir. You will be shocked by the increasingly bizarre tortures his mother inflicts and amazed by David's ability to withstand it all. Ultimately, the book left me feeling frustrated - I wanted to know why David's mother singled him out for her abuse and why his father, siblings and neighbors did so little to protect him. Then I realized that these were the same frustrations David has lived with most of his life. Furthermore, it's unrealistic to expect that there could be a rational explanation. Just as David does, the reader has to accept that the abuse was senseless.	2001-05-27
US	52027938	R1TK8GMZMPHF0N	0312261594	724183614	Female Intelligence	Books	2	5	8	N	Y	Not as funny as it thinks it is.	The premise of this book - poking fun at the experts who advise men and women how to communicate with one another - is promising, but the book didn't live up to expectations.  Lynn, a humorless and self-satisfied linguist, has developed a language she calls &quot;Womenspeak&quot; that she teaches to men who are at risk of losing their wives or their jobs because of their communication problems.  The majority of the book focuses on her attempts to teach this &quot;language&quot; to Brandon Brock, a famous CEO known as America's toughest boss.  Again, this is a premise ripe for amusement, but Heller repeatedly misses the mark.  First, the &quot;scripts&quot; she encourages Brandon to use are preposterous, not funny.  I know I was supposed to be amused when Lynn tells Brandon to initiate a conversation with a female executive by saying, &quot;Susan, I don't know how you metabloize desserts, but that chocolate mousse I had last night went straight to my thighs.&quot;  No female executive worth a damn thinks like that in a professional situation or wants her boss to talk like that.  Second, Heller grossly confuses insensitive behavior with sexual harrassment.  When a boss calls his female employees &quot;snookums&quot; or tells them their legs look &quot;hot&quot;, you're not looking at a failure of communications. Basically, this book is a very broad farce, not a witty and insightful look at the bizarre disconnects between male and female communications.  For a hilarious look at the same subject, chose &quot;Love Songs for the Tone Deaf&quot; by Asher Brauner.<br />Not only did I think that the author's humor was off the mark, but I also was unable to really connect with any of the characters.  Brandon was OK, but Lynn was a complete boor for most of the book.  Lynn's female friends make frequent appearances, but they were all so goofy and unappealing that I never learned to tell them apart.  I never could figure out why Lynn put up with them and couldn't have cared less if she was able to resolve her issues with them.  The only thing that kept me reading was the possibility of a romance blossoming between Lynn and Brandon.  That part of the book was actually pretty good.  Too bad it was surrounded by so much drivel.	2001-05-21

For those of you expecting a typical sizzling Bertrice Small romance, be prepared to get something different.  I actually found myself checking the cover again and again to make sure this was the same Bertrice Small.  There are virtually no [adult] scenes in this book, but the story is so compelling and wonderfully written that it doesn't need them.  This is the amazing story of Janet aka Cyra Leslie, a young Scottish girl kidnapped and purchased for a Selim, future Turkish sultan.  Even though this is not the life she would have chosen, she quickly adapts and is determined to make her life with Selim as pleasant as possible.  She forms a lasting bond with her fellow wives and finds herself madly in love with Selim.  This isn't a fairy tale romance.  Cyra has to share Selim with other women, and their life is repeatedly marred by violence and tragedy.  Her rise to power is fascinating, and all of the relationships in the book ring true.  The book is well-grounded in historical research, and the book reads like a true story.  Enjoy!	2001-05-15

Serious historians won't find much to peak their interest in this gossip-ladden review of the Regency period, but lay readers will find it an interesting and entertaining read.  The research supposedly comes from original sources, including newspaper columns about the foibles and follies of the haute ton.  Admist the many amusing anecdotes, the author tries to cover all aspects of daily living in England at the time.  Unfortunately, the structure of the book is such that there is a lot of repetition and I had trouble keeping track of (and interested in) the various many members of society that kept reappearing.  An amusing read, but not a definitive look at the era.	2001-05-12

Edwidge Danticat is a talented writer whose lyrical prose effectively transports the reader into the rhythms Haitian life.  The imagery is powerful and can be profoundly moving.  Unfortunately, I found that this promising start was irrevocably marred by the overblown ending.  Issues that Danticat addresses in the last half of the book include rape, sexual abuse, bulimia, abortion and breast cancer.  Any one or even two of these issues would have given the story the dramatic punch the author was looking for.  Two very marginal characters - one with genital mutilation and one with a history of incest - read like they were added to the story just to cover all the bases of female degredation.  There are so many ingredients in this stew of suffering that the reader is unable feel completely sympathetic to the victim of any one.  My predominant response to this book was disappointment that it didn't live up to its promising beginning.	2001-05-11

As he describes the days leading up to the legendary queen's death, he artfully illuminates the cast of supporting characters.  Thanks to Victoria's prolificate offspring, this includes most of the European nobility.  Packard also examines Victoria's daily life, both personal and public.  Furthermore, the significance of the great monarch's passing is put into context by his succinct analysis of the political situation in England and abroad.  All in all, a very interesting and well-written book that will whet your appetite for more information about this fascinating era.	2001-05-09

Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives, is a great regency romance hero - aristocratic, extremely masculine, very sexy.  He's made up his mind that Honoria Prudence is the wife for him, and he doggedly sets out to win her.  Honor is a refreshing change from most regency heroines.  She's sophisticated, not spunky; commanding, not wilfull; elegant, not dainty.  It's easy to see why Devil (yes, the names of the Bar Cynster cousins are silly - do your best to ignore it) is so determined to have her as his duchess.  Their courtship is wonderful - lots of tension and steamy love scenes.  Even better, we get to see their relationship mature after their marriage.

This book didn't do much for me.  The plot is old news - single woman with biological clock syndrome and her gay best friend decide to have a baby together.  Personally, I couldn't relate to Patty, the primary character.  She wants to get married and have a home life, but she can't get over her fixation with her gay former fiance.  Sorry, I can't believe that any woman with an ounce of self respect would act this way.  The secondary characters offered some promise, but they were never developed enough to carry the story.  The mother's issues were the most interesting part of the book.  If they had been more fully developed they could have added the emotional tension this story lacked.  Despite my complaints about this book, I did like Berg's writing style.  The dialogue is witty, and she has a nice ability to set a scene.  I will probably try some of her other books because the consensus seems to be that this was below par for her.	2001-05-04

There is no suspense about the facts of the story that forms the basis of this book.  Bob Rowe, a loving husband and father, beat his wife and three children to death with a baseball bat in 1978.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and served approximately three years in a criminal psychiatric ward.  Upon his release he remarried and had another child.  This book isn't your typical true crime book. Julie Salamon isn't interested in finding out the truth about what happened - that's already widely known.  Instead, the book is an invitation to consider some of the most difficult moral issues in our society: when does insanity excuse a crime?, should mentally ill patients be  punished as well as treated?, is it possible to forgive the most horrendous crimes?  Frustratingly, there are no definite answers and this case doesn't make the debate any clearer.  <br />Salomon clearly did an excellent job of interviewing a wide variety of people who knew Bob Rowe before and after his crime.  All points of view are represented, including unforgiving friends and colleagues and Rowe's extremely sympathetic second wife.  Because the Rowe's second son, Christopher, was born severely disabled, the original Rowe family was intimately involved with a support group for parents facing similar challenges with their children.  This group was the genesis of Salomon's book, and there is a lot of focus on these brave women and their relationship with Bob and Mary Rowe.  Given her reliance upon the memories of these women, it is not surprising that one of Salomon's underlying assumptions is that the strain of raising Christopher somehow contributed to Bob Rowe's breakdown and subsequent murder of his family.  I personally thought this was off base.  It seemed clear to me that Bob's breakdown was precipitated by his professional failures which existed quite apart from his home life.  The assistant DA had it right - this was an ego crime.  Bob Rowe was so self-centered that he killedhis family so they wouldn't have to witness HIS disgrace as a failed professional.  All in all, I found Rowe to be a not very sympathetic character, and I think he offers a persuasive example of why criminals who are found not guilty by reason of insanity should be required to serve the same number of years in a psychiatric facility as they would have to serve if they had been convicted and sent to prison.  A finding of not guilty by reason of insanity shouldn't be a get-out-of-jail-free card.<br />An interesting read that raises as many questions as it answers.	2001-05-03

I've read about the last Russian tsar, Nicholas II, and his family for years, but I never felt like I really understood their lives and their lifestyle until I bought and read this book.  The text is an interesting historical summation, but it doesn't reveal anything your average student of Russian history wouldn't already know.  What is so special about this book is the pictures.  Beautiful full-color photos of the magnificient palaces and locations frequented by the Russian royal family are displayed next to a comprehensive collection of historical photos from the era.  In addition to the classic royal portraits you have probably seen, there are many candid photos of the family going about their daily life.  Frequently, a historical picture is shown next to a gorgeous contemporary photograph of the same locale.  For example, a black and white photograph of two of the Grand Duchess rowing past the &quot;children's island&quot; at Tsarkoe Selo is shown with a brilliantly colored picture of the same spot as it looks today.  Thanks to these beautiful photographs, I have a whole new appreciation of the incredible luxury of the royal surroundings, and what a grand contrast it must have been to the lifestyle of the average Russian peasants.	2001-04-29

I'm a big fan of Stephanie Laurens and her Bar Cynster series of regency romances, but this is a difficult book for me to review.  On the one hand, this book has my favorite hero of the series, Demon, and it has some of the best love scenes.  The relationship between Demon and Flick constantly sizzles and when it bursts into flame - watch out!  I particularly liked the time they spent in London during the Season where Demon is simultaneously trying to court her and protect her reputation from being seen with him.  On the other hand, the heroine can be one of the most annoying ninnies you'll ever find.  She's one of those plucky young ladies who repeatedly proves her independence by deliberately rushing headlong into situations that even a three-year old could tell were dangerous.  After she has been saved by Demon from certain rape after being warned against chasing the bad guys all by herself, she actually says, &quot;There's nothing you can say or do that will convince me I don't have as much right as you to go hying after villains.&quot;  Oh?  How about the fact that you are too stupid to breathe?  It's a mystery to me why romance novelists can't write about heroines who need rescuing because their in peril through no fault of their own.

Jennifer Crusie is one of those writers I buy the second she comes out with a new book, and this was no exception.  I read it in one sitting and thoroughly enjoyed it.  For Crusie fans, it's not as good as &quot;Welcome to Temptation&quot; (what could be?), but it's better than &quot;Tell Me Lies.&quot;  Crusie's trademark writing is as good as ever - hilarious dialouge, hot love scenes, well-drawn cast of leading and secondary characters, fast-paced plot.  Nevertheless, this is something more than the usual contemporary romance.  I thought that the mystery at the core of the plot was exceptionally good.  They are usually so predictable in romance novels, but this one had some twists that kept me guessing.  Second, this book is really a pretty good study of the emotional chaos created by infidelity and divorce.  It takes a very honest look at the various stages women go through, including the immediate post-divorce insanity.

You will gain a whole new understanding of how your dog thinks and what he feels.  I was particularly impressed with his discussion of dogs' superstitious behavior.  I have a dog who will not stay in a room where there is a fire in the fireplace, but he is otherwise completely unafraid of fire (from candles or outdoor fires).  I don't know when, but he was obviously burned by a flying ember from a fireplace.  Stephen Budiansky would explain that he is unable to distinguish the circumstances of his injury from the cause of his injury.  This and other insights into how my dog perceives the world are invaluable. <br />Budiansky is not a professional biologist or veterinarian, but his research is thorough.  He does a particularly good job distilling technical biology and psychology into comprehensible and interesting reading for the lay person.  For example, his explanation of how dogs see colors is a fascinating blend of technical information and practical examples.  It's not light reading, but any dog owner will be glad they read this book.	2001-04-27

You don't have to be a history buff to be fascinated by Doug Stanton's compelling chronicle of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, the worst catastrophe in the history of the US Navy.  Shortly after delivering the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and hastened the end of World War II, the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.  The ship sank within minutes, leaving approximately 900 crewmen stranded at sea.  Incredibly, the ship's brief distress call was ignored and the Navy did not notice that the ship was missing for over 4 days.  Most of the surving crewmen were badly injured and virtually without survival equipment or even basic clothing.  After battling vicious shark attacks, dehydration, exposure and exhaustion for days, 321 men were eventually rescued.  Stanton's masterful recounting of this epic tale is a worthy testimonial to these courageous surviors.  He adroitly combines the historical record with the powerful and poignant personal stories of key survivors.  The result is a vivid, forceful book that you will long remember.	2001-04-25

This is generally considered to be the definitive biography of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra.  Massie's expert storytelling is well-suited to the compelling story of the last Russian tsar and his consort.  The history of Russia was no doubt changed by the deliberate myopia and general inadquacies of these two people.  Nevertheless, Massie manages to uncover a more sympathetic side to the ill-fated duo.  Massie's writing is as good as that of any acclaimed novelist - there's a fascinating and fastpaced plot, finely nuanced lead characters, an intriguing supporting cast, all against a beautiful background of a majestic bygone era.<br />This book was researched and written before the fall of the Soviet empire when the state archives were opened and new information about the Romanovs was revealed.  Consequently, this book is necessarily incomplete, especially as concerns the execution of the royal family.  Massie has since written another text called &quot;The Romanovs:  The Last Chapter&quot; which devels deeply into the newly available data and the forensic studies that followed.  Consider it an essential volume II to &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;.	2001-04-22

In this wonderfully nuanced book, Greg King explores one of the most complex and contraversial figures in Russian history.  Alexandra Romanov was universally reviled by the Russian people and scorned by the Russian aristocracy.  King does an excellent job of exposing the woman beneath the legend.  One the one hand you see the exceptionally devoted wife and mother who desperately fights to preserve her family and their heritage.  On the other hand, you see an unyielding and essentially stupid autocrat who is unable and unwilling to accept wise counsel or clearly see the dangers all around her.  The story of Rasputin is the perfect example.  She remains desperately devoted to the Russian holy man because of her belief that he can save her hemophiliac son  despite the overwhelming evidence that he is a serious threat to the empire.  <br />Alexandra is a fascinating subject, and King's balanced analysis of her character and her impact on the history of Russia is excellent.  King combines excellent research with complelling story-telling.  This book leaves you with a sense of sympathy for such a misunderstood woman and a simultaneous frstration that she was so stubbornly misguided in her attempts to influence political events.	2001-04-22

If ever there was a case that calls for an adept and lengthy analysis, this is it.  Andrew Cunanan is one of the most bizarre and elusive criminals of the modern era, and this is a marvelous study of his personal history and his crimes.  Maureen Orth is an experienced jouralist who began investigating Cunanan in the midst of his crime spree.  Her account benefits from having actually experienced all the false leads and baseless conjecture that tainted the criminal investigation as it was happening.  She does a thorough job of digging through Cunanan's childhood and the exclusive gay world he deliberately sought to infiltrate.  You can't help but conclude that there never was a &quot;real&quot; Andrew Cunanan; he was never anything more than a series of self-invented masks.  Orth does an equally comprehensive study of the first two victims, Jeff Trail and David Madson.  Frustratingly, both she and the professionals are unable to come to any conclusions as to what really happened with the two murders.  Lee Miglin's murder is even more mysterious.  Orth largely avoids sensationalistic theorizing as to why Miglin was selected as a victim.  In constrast, Cunanan's reasons for selecting the next two victims, Bill Reese and Giovani Versace, are readily apparent but no less disturbing.  The absolute conclusion one can draw from the book is that Cunanan was a conscienceless sociopath and egomaniac.  A truly sad and shocking story.	2001-04-15

This is one of the best and most useful cookbooks by a great chef that you are likely to find.  Too often such books aren't suited for the home cook and are more about ego than food.  That is definitely not the case here.  Andre Soltner was the owner and chef of the renowed Lutece, a New York institution, for three decades.  In this book he shares some of the history of the great restaurant as well as his Alastian heritage.  The focus of the book, however, is the food.  Significantly, Soltner recognizes that he is writing for the home cook.  He thoughtfully provides tips on how to find ingredients or acceptable substitutes for those of us who don't have access to an exotic wholesaler and suggests the best kinds of kitchen accessories to use.  It is obvious that Soltner cooks these recipes in his own home.  You don't need a first class professional kitchen to enjoy these recipes.  Also, the recipes are designed for suitable portion sizes; these aren't recipes to feed a crowd that have been shrunk to fit the cookbook.  Just because this book is practical, however, doesn't mean that it doesn't focus on the most sophisticated kind of food.  There is plenty of classical French cooking in this book, but it all seems like something you can accomplish in your own kitchen.  There are plenty of things in here that you won't want to cook - there's an abundance of organ meats - but you will thoroughly enjoy anything that you do prepare.  This is a great addition to any kitchen library.	2001-04-15

Linda Howard is a great writer of contemporary and historic romances, and here she successfully tries another subgenre - the time travel romance.  As a general rule, it's not my favorite genre, but Howard does a wonderful job.  This is the story of Grace St. John, an academic who is translating a mysterious ancient Scottish manuscript.  After her husband and brother are murdered in an effort to get the manuscript, she realizes that it contains valable and powerful secrets.  She learns to live in hiding and continues her translation.  She begins to have shockingly realistic dreams about Balck Niall, the Scottish warrior that features prominently in her translated text.  Meanwhile, hundreds of years ago in Scotland...Niall is having the same dreams.  Eventually Grace deciphers a formula for going back in time and shows up most unexpectedly in the midst of a bloody battle.  Naturally Niall is fiercely attracted to her, but he has reason to be suspicious of her sudden appearance and her motives.<br />There are so many things about this book that I like.  First, Grace is not one of those dingbat heroines who dashes headlong into dangerous situations just to show how spunky and independent she is.  Grace recognizes and appreciates the risks she faces and diligently does her best to survive.  Second, the time travel doesn't just &quot;happen&quot;.  That's always been my pet peeve with most time travel romances - suddenly one of the characters finds themselves traveling through time for no apparent reason.  Howard's explanation may be somewhat fanciful, but at least it IS an explanation.  Third, Howard doesn't tidy up 14th century Scotland.  This isn't modern times with old fashioned clothes.  This Scotland is dangerous and dirty and primitive.  Not that these things alone make the book great; it just that they minimize the distractions from the imaginative and sensual story Howard has created.  And that's another big point - there aren't alot of sex scenes in this book, but the ones that are there are incredibly hot.  Don't say I didn't warn you.ut the ones that are there are incredibly hot.  Don't say I didn't warn you.	2001-04-15

I've always loved his acting - he does a marvelous job playing droll English aristocrats.  This is more of the same, and even though it doesn't live up to the caliber of his acting, Everett's fans will enjoy it.  Parts of this novel are clearly autobiographical (not all, one hopes), and those are the parts that are the most successful.  Especially adept was his portrayal of the vain neurosis of a semi-young, handsome actor.  All in all, I prefer Stephen Fry's take on the modern English comedy of errors novel, but that only seems fair since I prefer Everett's acting.	2001-04-15

This is the most comprehensive guide to seafood you will ever find.  James Peterson has compiled great recipes and an amazing amount of information in this one volume.  He very systematically describes every edible variety of seafood you're likely to find.  He tells you what to look for when you are shopping, how to handle it and gives you a variety of options on how to cook it.  I was particularly impressed with the &quot;how to&quot; photographs that demonstrate everything from how to fillet a variety of fish to how to shuck oysters and peel shrimp.  The novice home cook will certainly benefit from this wealth of practical advice, and the more experienced chef will find all sorts of inspiring ideas for preparing favorite seafood.  Peterson artfully combines recipes and serving suggestions from a variety of culinary traditions.  He's equally adept at contemporary Thai-inspired soups and traditional French preparations.  He also gives you the information you need to branch out and experiment on your own.  For example, there are great charts suggesting pairings of shrimp and possible soup ingredients and a thorough offering of traditional sauces to mix and match with your own seafood preparations.  This is truly an amazing resource that anyone who loves seafood should have in their kitchen.	2001-04-11

Like many books by famous restaurant chefs, this isn't a terribly practical cookbook for the home cook.  Especially on dessert menus, many restaurants emphasize presentation as much as the quality of the food. Elaborate architectural wonders comprised of many different parts - pastry, pastry cream, cookies, fresh fruit and multiple sauces all in the same dessert - are the norm.  This book is a good example of that.  The pictures are beautiful and inspiring to look at, but these aren't recipes that most home cooks would want to conquer.  When we cook at home we want something lush and creamy and chocolatey that satisfies our craving for comfort food.  We're usually not concerned with creating a stunning visual presentation.  Furthermore, this book suffers from another common problem with chef cookbooks:  the recipes were originally designed to make large quantities for restaurants and the conversion to a home-sized portion is sloppy.  Too frequently you'll find that the recipes call for too much butter or not enough salt.  If you have a chance, take a look at the pictures in this book, but don't bother adding it to your collection.	2001-04-10

There's nothing like discovering a new author you love and settling in to read the backlist.  Stephanie Laurens is my new favorite, and I am having a great time reading all the Bar Cynster novels.  These are the best Regency romances I've read in years.  Don't worry about reading them in order.  Other Cynsters make enough of an appearance to whet your appetite for more but not so much as to reveal the plots of the books you haven't read.<br />&quot;A Secret Love&quot; is the fifth in the series, and it is Gabriel's story.  Althea Morwellan, Gabriel's childhood friend, is in dire financial straights and deperately needs his help.  For a variety of reasons, she doesn't want to come right out and ask for his assistance; instead, she creates &quot;the Countess&quot;, a mysterious figure deliberately designed to entice Gabriel.  Now this next part requires a certain suspension of disbelief. Gabriel and the Countess, aka Althea, have some very steamy encounters, but Gabriel doesn't figure out that the two are one and the same.  I, too, didn't buy it, but if you're willing to believe that Regency England was awash with gorgeous, sensitive, masculine, sexy men, you can probably live with this plot device.  It leads to a very sweet story about two people finding love where they least expected it.  Because of their shared history, there's a certain depth to Gabriel and Althea's romance that is quite appealing.  Additonally, the story benefited from the fact that the characters were full-grown adults (32 and 33 years old) and approximately the same age.  I really get tired of spunky, independent 18 year old virgins and jaded older males.  All in all, this is a great regency romance and you'll have a great time reading it!	2001-04-10

This is a book designed for those of us who don't usually read self-help books.  Anna Johnson has compiled lots of good, sound advice for getting your life in shape. Among other things, she covers finances, makeup, clothes, home decor, love life, physical health in this one engaging book.  For me, the best part of the book was her introduction.  Her philosophy is a good one - you're never going to have it all together in all parts of your life so don't feel like a failure every time your house isn't cleaned, you have a junkfood attack or run your hose.  Try to do a little better where you can, but don't think you can do it all.  This isn't anything new, but Johnson gives it to us with a fresh and modern perspective.  <br />Johnson has relied upon experts for many of the specific topics with generally good results.  Each topic is pared down to its bare essentials.  Sometimes it's easy to forget that these are just tips, not a must-do list.  Don't consider all of her advice to be dogma; many of them are just a reflection of her personal taste and lifestyle.  For example, she pooh-poohs waterproof mascara, but for those of us who were contacts and put in a lot of eyedrops, it's essential.  Similarly, ignore the rules on clothes and decor if they don't work for you.  Everyone has a different figure and no one style of dressing or article of clothing works for everyone.  Nevertheless, Johnson's taste is simple and classic, and you can generally feel safe following Johnson's advice to the letter.	2001-04-10

Jennifer Crusie is in a class by herself when it comes to contemporary romance.  I laughed so hard my stomach hurt more than once while I was reading &quot;Welcome to Temptation&quot;.  Who ever heard of a funny autopsy scene?  This book has one that should become a classic.  I'm absolutely awed by Crusie's ability to write a sex scene that is incredibly hot but still makes you laugh out loud. This book works on so many levels - the characters are memorable, the dialogue is snappy, the plot is interesting and the core relationship sizzles. <br />The two main characters are hysterical contrasts.  Sophie is the daughter of a con artist who has come to Temptation to make a film with her sister that may or may not be porn.  Phin is the unenthusiastic mayor of Temptation who has an election on the horizon and a gaggle of nosy relatives and neighbors intent upon scrutinizing his every move.  Both of them recognize the dangers of a relationship between them - she's bound to get hurt in a relationship with a &quot;townie&quot; and he's got to worry about the new anti-porn sentiment in town - but since Sophie's only going to be there for a few days, a light affair seems manageable.  Sure enough, Sophie's stay lasts longer than anticipated and things get complicated.  There's a dead body to deal with, a daughter to appease, a brother to pacify, and a mother to avoid.  Funny and sweet, this is a book to savor.	2001-04-09

The paradoxical nature of reality is that everyone perceives it differently yet everyone thinks that their version is the &quot;correct&quot; one.  If you've read any of the reports on the tragedy on Mt. Everest in May 1996, it's evident that no one person knows the whole story yet each person on the mountain that day has their own version of what happened.  I was hopeful that this book would add an insightful new perspective, but I was immensely disappointed.  Lene Gammelgaard's account is nothing but an exercise in self-aggrandizement.  She repeatedly suggests that the tragedy was the result of too many amateurs buying their way onto the mountain and putting everyone else in jeopardy.  Undoubtedly true, but Gammelgaard is being hypocritical at best.  Her silly &quot;spirit of the mountain&quot; claptrap, foolhardy demand that she be allowed to summit without oxygen and lack of familiarity with some of the most basic equipment mark her as one of the same crowd.  While &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; may have reflected its authors' biases, at least he was willing to acknowledge that there might be some and to look at his own mistakes that fateful day.  Gammelgaard makes no such concessions.  I'm glad I read the book just because it gives me a fresh perspective on one of the players, but it's certainly not a favorable one.	2001-04-05

This is a journalist's account of a tragic murder/suicide at Harvard in 1995.  The story is a fascinating insight into four contrasting cultures - the ex-patriot Vietnamese society of Trang Phuong Ho, the victim, the austere Ethopian culture of the perpetrator, Sinedu Tadesse, our own privileged and frequently xenophobic country and the rarefied and elitist world of higher education.  Trang's death is obviously maddeningly senseless and deprives us all of a talented and admirable young woman.  Nevertheless, I found Sinedu's story equally agonizing.  Her overwhelming loneliness and alienation are wrenching to read.  On the one hand, you desperately wish that someone would reach out to her.  On the other, you can appreciate how offputtingly needy she was and sympathize with Trang's decision to break away from Sinedu'e smothering affection.  Thernstrom does a particularly good job of investigating Sinedu's heritage, and the picture is unbearably pathetic. <br />The book does have its flaws.  Thernstrom inserts herself far too much into the story.  Her own experiences at Harvard were more distracting than helpful in setting in the context, and frankly seemed unnecessarily self-indulgent.  It left me with a niggling sense that Thernstom was capitalizing on the tragedy rather than objectively reporting it.  Similarly, I thought she made way too much of the fact that the administration wasn't anxious to cooperate with her story.  Aside from the obvious liability issues, it seems clear that Thernstrom made it obvious that she was looking to point fingers.  I personally thought she was overreaching in suggesting that this was a tragedy that should have been avoided.  While colleges could no doubt do a better job of tending the psychiatric health of their students, this was in many ways an unusual confluence of events that doesn't accurately reflect typical scenarios that colleges should be anticipating.  These quibbles aside, however, the book is a solid piece of journalismand a fascinating read.	2001-04-05

The first thing you notice about &quot;Love Songs for the Tone Deaf&quot; is that it is wickedly funny.  There are more insightful and slyly humorous observations in this book than I can begin to describe.  A few of my favorites:  the 4 species of hippie, ludicrous political correctness, the myriad failures of amorphous altruism. You can't read this book without laughing out loud.  In addition to being very, very witty, Asher Brauner has brilliantly captured an entire generation of would-be radicals.  <br />The narrator, Ronnie, is reluctantly drawn into the world of campus politics by his hippie girlfriend, Karen.  Even if you've never been to a campus protest or organized a petition (perhaps especially if you haven't done those things), you will recognize the well-meaning but essentially fad-ish campus radicals that are the target of the Ronnie's scathing contempt. In spite of himself, Ronnie becomes a leader of the cause and eventually even comes to support it.  His journey from mocking outsider to unwilling hero is hysterical.  Not surprisingly, his relationship with Karen changes as well - but not so much that they don't remain at the opposite ends of the optimism scale.  In many ways this is a story about why opposites should attract one another.  Anyone who's had a relationship with their polar opposite will relate to this book.	2001-04-05

Catherine Anderson writes romances that are so powerful and finely nuanced that they transcend their genre (not that I'm knocking romances!), and this book is no exception.  It is the story of Rebecca Morgan, a member of devout religious sect that firmly believes in non-violence and is traveling across the wilderness to settle in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Along the way they are attacked by a band of outlaws that brutal murder and rape all of the sect except Rebecca.  She is rescued by Race Spencer, a poorly educated former gunslinger.  The two could not be more different.  She is very educated and refined whereas Race grew up in the worst sort of circumstances and has never had an opportunity to go to school or enjoy any other civilized amenities.  Nevertheless, he is obviously very wise in the ways of the world and incredibly compassionate.  He is immediately attracted to Rebecca but recognizes not only that they are from completely different worlds but also that Rebecca has grown unhealthly dependent upon him after her recent trama.  <br />In any other book Race's mangled English would have driven me crazy, but Anderson does such a fine job of portraying Race's very practical common sense and understanding that it wasn't a distraction.  In fact, I could appreciate the humor in Race and Rebecca's frequent misunderstandings.  Rebecca's emotional fragility and irrational fears could be frustrating, but they are so realistic that they ring true.  This is an unusual story, but one that most readers will really enjoy.	2001-04-04

Let me reveal my prejudices right up front - I'm a big Elizabeth Lowell fan and I've loved all of her contemporary novels, especially the Donovan series.  &quot;Pearl Cove&quot;, however, is truly exceptional.  Archer Donovan is the oldest Donovan brother, and he has a definite edge about him.  He's physically amazing - of course - but he also has deep emotions that he keeps tightly controlled.  When his illegitimate half-brother's wife, Hannah, asks him to come to Pearl Cove, Australia following the brother's murder, he immediately leaves his comfortable home in Seattle.  The trip stirs up a lot of emotions for Archer.  There's his complicated relationship with the half-brother, his uncomfortable past as a secret operative, and his forbiden attraction to Hannah herself.  You're in for lots of love, lust and adventure as he and Hannah sort it out. <br />One of Lowell's fortes is her wonderful research which she artfully weaves into her story.  You'll learn any amazing amount about the fascinating world of pearls while you're reading this book - the way they're made, how they are appraised and the international pearl market - but Lowell so skillfully adds it to the story that you won't feel like you're getting a lesson.  You will also love her well-developed and exciting characters, not to mention the Donovan family.  I like my family quite a lot, but I'd be happy to be adopted by the Donovans...

I loved this book and the entire Texas! series when they first came out.  When I was going through some old books, I remembered how much I liked this one and reread it.  It's amazing how quickly it has aged.  It's still a pleasant read, but the idea of a successful thirty-five year old woman being so desperate to marry that she would propose to a man she hardly knew seems incredibly old-fashioned.  Admittedly I might feel this way because I'm older and more successful than I was when I first read this book and can't begin to fathom why anyone wouldn't love the lifestyle, but it still smacks of old-fashioned thinking.  I actually looked at the date the book was published and was shocked to find that it came out in 1991.  Also, being a Texan, the dark days of the oil bust seem so far away now.  Anyway, this is a nice light read, but it's not going on my keeper shelf.	2001-04-04

This is so much more than just a cookbook; it is a fascinating look at all aspects of Italian &quot;country&quot; cooking.  Lynn Rossetto Kasper's deep love for her Italian heritage seeps out of every page of this book, and you can't help but share her enthusiasm.  She takes you through the basics of Italian cooking in a whole new light.  For example, not only does she teach you how to make pasta, but she also unravels the mystery of how to pair pasta and sauce.  Even better, she tells you which brands of dried pasta are best and exactly how to cook them.  The section on tomato sauces is amazing.  She doesn't just give you a few recipes - she explains the four basic varieties of tomato sauces and when to use each.  Reading this book teaches you how to think about food like an Italian home cook.  Once you can do that, you don't need a recipe to plan a meal, just the right ingredients and a love for great food.	2001-04-04

This is the first full-length novel by Stephanie Laurens that I've read, and it certainly won't be the last.  &quot;All About Love&quot; is the story of &quot;Lucifer&quot; Cynster, a supposed rake who has retired to the country to visit an old friend.  He is shocked to find that his friend has very recently been murdered when he arrives in the charming village of Colyton.  He also immediately meets Phyllida, a beautiful young woman who is also the town busybody and clearly knows more that she's telling about the murder.  Despite their mutual mistrust, the two are surprised by their attraction to one another and begin to work together to solve the murder.  Before he met Phyllida, Lucifer had no intention of ever falling in love and marrying.  Likewise, Phyllida was quite content with her life in the village and was certain that she will never marry.  Most of the story is about how the two become comfortable with one another and the idea of falling in love and making a lifetime commitment.<br />Despite a couple of nitpicks - I really hate it when heroines insist upon putting themselves in danger just to prove their &quot;independence&quot; and the suspects were all so similar that I had a hard time telling them apart - this was one of the best books I've read recently.  Even though the plot was not terribly complicated or original (in my opinion, not really a flaw in a good romance), Laurens kept me interested all the way through.  The growing relationship between the two leads was particularly well written and even surprisingly realistic.  These two people didn't lay eyes on one another and immediately fall in love.  They met, were attracted to one another, and let the attraction develop into something deeper.  Laurens also writes great love scenes - hot but still sweet.  This is the 6th novel in a series about the Bar Cynster, but don't worry if you haven't read the previous books.  I haven't and it didn't make one bit of difference.  You can bet I'll read the other 5 and when I'm done, I'll really enjoy picking this book back up and reading the epilogue where the whole family meets at a summer gathering.	2001-04-04

John Irving has written a remarkable novel that manages to thughtfully address both sides of the abortion debate.  On the one hand he gives us Homer Wells, a remarkable young man who strongly opposed to abortion.  After all, he was abandoned at an orphange by a mother who didn't want him. and he can keenly appreciate the fact that he would not be alive if abortion had been readily available to his mother.  On the other hand, Irving paints a compassionate picture of the women who desperately need access to safe abortions - those who would otherwise risk their very lives to rid themselves of an unwanted baby and those who are victims of rape and incest.  <br />Even though this is a weighty subject, Irving manages to address it in a beautiful story that is often amusing, always entertaining and never preachy.  If you enjoyed the movie, you will no doubt also enjoy this novel.  This is a richer, more faceted story than the one in movie and sometimes can be surprisingly crude and brutal.  Nevertheless, it is a charming novel and one all readers will long remember.	2001-04-01

If you're a fan of romance, you definitely need to discover Elizabeth Lowell, and &quot;Only His&quot; is a great place to start.  This is the first in a series of 4 novels about the Moran siblings and life in the Colorado wilderness after the Civil War.  Lowell always does great research, but her true forte is creating unique and wonderful characters.  This is the story of Willow Moran, the only daughter in the Moran family, who following the death of her parents goes in search of one of her brothers, Matt Moran, in the Colorado Rockies.  As her guide she hires Caleb Black, a tall, dark and handsome man who, unbeknownst to Willow, has his own score to settle with Matt Moran.  Despite Caleb's misgivings, Willow handles the harrowing and dangerous journey across the wilderness surprisingly well, and the two are increasingly drawn to one another.  Only Caleb knows that there is certain tragedy ahead when and if they find Matt.<br />Both of the main characters are very well-drawn, and Lowell masterfully builds the sexual tension between them.  The love scenes are steamy and the action scenes are very compelling.  I ususally would skim through gun battles, but Lowell does such a good job that you won't want to miss them.  You'll be sorry to see this book end.  Luckily it's just the beginning of the Moran saga!	2001-04-01

Like many of Anita Shreve's novels, the structure  of this book seems to have started as a writing assignment Shreve might have assigned as a college professor.  The story begins with with Helen Scofield, an experienced journalist who began her career at a prominent weekly news magazine, visiting a young college co-ed.  Helen has come to turn over her research and notes from a famous story she wrote decades earlier about the girl's mother.  While we don't know the details, it is clear that the magazine piece had a profound effect of the family's life and that Helen has second thoughts about the story she wrote.  The research consists of transcripts and notes from Helen's interviews with Mary Amesbury aka Maureen English, a former colleague at the magazine, and those who knew her during her brief stay in St. Hilaire on the Maine coast.  It quickly becomes apparent that the subject of the piece is domestic abuse, as seen through the lens of the prejudices and ignorance of the early 1970s.  Shreve lays out the facts in the &quot;research&quot; and allows us to hear the original voice of the relevant characters and come to  our own conclusions about what happened and why.  At the end of the book we get to read Helen's original article and consider the accuracy and sensationalism of Helen's take on the story.  <br />The structure of the book certainly makes it a fascinating read, but equally noteworthy are Shreve's lyrical prose and vivid descriptions of the Maine shore.  One constant in all of Shreve's books is her obvious love for and familiarity with the rugged New England coast and the people who live there.  All in all, this is a wonderful book, challenging, intriquing, thought-provoking.  You'll be glad you read it.	2001-04-01

As always, Morrison's prose is masterful and her imagery is sublime.  It says a lot about Morrison's skill that this is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read.  For me, this was essentially a story about how much pain and abuse can be heaped upon one small, innocent child before she breaks.  Pecola, the young black girl at the heart of the story, has committed no crime except being ugly.  As she is repeatedly hurt, negligected, ostracized and violated by everyone around her, she concludes that if only she had blue eyes, she would suddenly become lovable.  Morrison invites all of us to examine our hidden prejudices when it comes to race and appearance.  It's not a pleasant experience, but it is a meaningful one.  This book stays with you, and you'll be glad it does.	2001-04-01

Sebastian Junger is a remarkable journalist as can you clearly see in the depth of his research and the precision of his prose.  He's also a very gifted storyteller, and he has chosen a particularly compelling subject.  This is a book about the &quot;perfect storm&quot;, an unprecedented collision of meteorological conditions that created  a cataclysmic storm in the north Atlantic in October of 1991.  The book actually consists of several different incidents that took place during the storm.  The most compelling is the story of the Andrea Gail, a commercial fishing boat that disappeared in the storm.  The exact details of the vessel's end can't be known with certainty, but Junger does a remarkable job of weaving together the most likely scenario from his research about the crew, the history of the vessel and the experience of other ships in the region.  He has even researched death by drowning, and he portrays a moving picture of the crew's probable last moments.  The other parts of the book are equally remarkable.  You will be particularly impressed with the bravery and heroism of the Air National Guard.	2001-04-01

This book isn't as funny as some of Andersen's previous novels, but the characters are appealing and the love scenes are hot.  The hero is more anquished than I care for.  I thought he had a pretty accurate view of his own limitations - someone with his history of emotional abandonment wouldn't be able to fall easily into a lasting relationship.  This also isn't the most original book I've ever read.  The setting was so similar to the one in Jennifer Crusie's &quot;Manhunting&quot; that I had a weird sense of deja vu the entire time.  Still, this is a fun, fast read by a consistently good author.	2001-03-27

This is one of the most unique romance novels you will ever read.  Rejar is a &quot;Familiar&quot;, a creature that is able to change itself from human form into a cat, who inadvertantly lands in Regency England.  He meets and pursues a young lady of the ton.  One problem - she's not too crazy about the idea of being married to a man who turns into a cat.  However, she can't completely resist the incredibly senuous Rejar.  Dara Joy's novels are always very sexy, but in Rejar she has created a particularly erotic hero.  I was very impressed with how well she creates this unique character, and I really enjoyed watching him discover this new world and work through having a relationship with a woman totally unfamiliar with his kind.  Fun book!  I can't wait for the next novels in this series.	2001-03-22

This is a disappointing sequel to Amy Thomson's novel &quot;The Color of Distance&quot;.  &quot;Color&quot; was the story of a human abandoned on an another planet who was forced to understand an alien lifestyle.  This story is the reverse - aliens are taken to Earth and struggle to understand the mysterious ways of humans.  The great appeal of &quot;Color&quot; was Thomason's wonderfully imaginative creation of a new world and a very different species with a unique culture.  This novel lacks that originality.  Thomason offers nothing new in her rendition of a futuristic Earth- environmental destruction, political divisions, xenophobia.  Added to this, there isn't much plot.  I managed to slog through this book, but I wouldn't recommend it.	2001-03-22

Turns out he was telling the truth, and the two go on a very exciting and surprising quest.  <br />This book is a lot of fun, and all but the most rigid sci fi fans will enjoy Dara Joy's wonderful imagination.  The plot is pretty good and the secondary characters are almost as much fun as the principals.  My only complaint would be that Deana is one of those annoying heroines who spends way too much time insisting that she's not good enough for the hero.  It's a minor complaint, however, and won't keep you from having a great time reading this book.	2001-03-20

There are two categories of people who will read this book:  fans of contemporary romantic suspense and fans of Mary Jo Putney.  The first group will probably find this to be a perfectly enjoyable read; the second will be sorely disappointed.  Ms. Putney is one of the very best historical romance writers around and as a huge fan, I wish she'd stick to that genre.  &quot;The Burning Point&quot; was OK, but if certainly didn't rise to the level of her usual outstanding books.  <br />Like other reviewers, I was very uncomfortable with a reformed d wife-beater as the hero.  We'd all like to believe that such men can reform, but unfortunately it's very rare.  I'd hate to see this book feed the fantasies of victims of domestic violence that their abuser is really is a wonderful guy and if they are patient enough he will turn into a sensitive, caring mate.	2001-03-12

She's one of the very best, and she consistently delivers great books.  &quot;Castles&quot; is my personal favorite.  The heroine, Alesandra, is particularly well suited to Garwood's blend of humor and naivete.  She's lead a plausibly sheltered life and is quite charming as she bungles her way through all the new experiences that come her way once she meets Colin.  Best of all, you feel like she's got a brain in her head and some common sense despite her general innocence about the world.  I also really liked Colin.  Yes, he is stuborn and frequently blind to what is staring him in the face, but in a believable way.  A very likable alpha male.  <br />A special treat for Garwood fans will be catching up on characters from previous novels - &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;.  If you haven't read the other novels, don't worry - they can be read in any particular order.	2001-03-06

Mary Jo Putney is better than any romance author I know at creating unique and exciting characters for each of her books.  I particularly loved Lucien and Kit in this book.  Lucien will be familiar to readers of the Fallen Angel series as the group's mysterious and aloof spymaster.  While investigating the Hellfire Club he repeatedly runs into an elusive woman who appears in a variety of guises and to whom he is immediately attracted.  Unlike many heros in romance novels, he is not a rake which makes his attraction to the mystery woman even more compelling.  Lucien eventually discovers that the woman is &quot;Kit&quot; Travers and unravels her story - she is searching for her lost twin.  The adventure that follows is very imaginative and unique, and the romance is particularly poignant.  <br />All of the Fallen Angels stand on their own very well - you can start with this one or with any one in the series.  Be forewarned - once you start you'll want to have them all.	2001-03-04

She not only creates wonderful three dimensional characters, but she is also subtly promoting a certain feminist philosophy.  The central theme running through all of Schone's books is the idea that women's sexuality is just as important as men's and that women should have the same freedom to fulfill their sexual needs.  &quot;The Lover&quot; is another variation on this theme.  <br />The heroine, Anne, is a 36 year old spinster who has spent her entire adulthood in Victorian England caring for her elderly parents and has never had an opportunity to have a romance.  Now that her parents have died, she decides to use part of her inheritance to purchase a male prostitute to teach her about sex.  The prostitute, Michael, has been in forced retirement since he was badly burned in an accident several years before.  Michael sees his relationship with Anne as a chance for redemption from his mysterious past.  As they begin to progress towards a relationship, they must both battle ghosts from Michael's past.<br />As always, Schone has done a wonderful job creating well developed and sympathetic characters.  Her love scenes are incredibly sensual and frequently very graphic.  I am particularly impressed with Scone's historical research and her efforts to make her characters and their relationship true to the time period.  I personally thought the mystery elements of the story were a bit overwrought - I particularly didn't like Michael's constant reference to &quot;the man&quot; - but those of you with a more gothic bent will appreciate them.  All in all, &quot;The Lover&quot; is a very good, very powerful book.	2001-03-03

I use them all the time and consider them to be the resource of first recourse when I need a new recipe.  While &quot;The New Basics&quot; is a good cookbook, it doesn't come close to the originals.  <br />You could tell that The Silver Palate Cookbook and The Silver Palate Goodtimes Cookbook were filled with recipes that Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins had been making for years.  I don't get the same feeling from New Basics.  Instead, you get a sense that they had to find recipes to round-out their repertoire.  Also, even though they do repeat a few recipes from the first two cookbooks, you can tell they really had to stretch in order to keep from completely repeating themselves, in part because the other two books were very comprehensive.  For example, the Silver Palate Cookbook has a recipe for creme brulee, but New Basics has a recipe for &quot;Fruity Creme Brulee&quot;.  You tell me which is the more &quot;basic&quot; recipe.  <br />If you already own and enjoy the other Silver Palette cookbooks, by all means get this one.  You will find lots of new recipes and ideas with the same focus on fresh ingredients and practical explanation of techniques that you found in the originals.  However, if you're looking for a cookbook with a wide variety of &quot;basic&quot; recipes, I'd recommend getting The Silver Palate Cookbook instead and working your way up to this one.	2001-03-02

Irony of ironies, I read this book the day before the 6.8 earthquake here in Seattle.  How did the section on &quot;How to Survive and Earthquake&quot; fare? Pretty well. Tip No. 1 is &quot;If you are indoors, stay there!&quot;  Having looked outside the window of my downtown office building and watched the light poles, electrical wires, stop lights etc. bounce around over the heads of pedestrians, I'd say that was pretty good advice.  The authors also suggest where to go - under a desk or table, under a doorway, in a hallway or against an interior wall - and stay away from glass.  I went for the doorway option, which wasn't that great an idea because the door kept trying to slam closed.  Next time I'll take the first suggestion and get under the desk.  The authors also suggest that you stay off the phone so that the lines will remain clear for emergencies.  Good advice, but virtually impossible to follow. The cellphone lines were immediately jammed (and I know this because, yes, I did try to check in with family). Nevertheless, the overall advice is very sound, and I was glad to have read it.<br />The rest of the book is a mix of things that might actually be useful someday and things that are just there for amusement's sake.  I'm absolutely positive that I'll never leap from a motorcycle into a car, but it was fun to read how to do it.	2001-03-01

Plus, there are lots of great tips on planning a party and cooking for a crowd.  I particularly recommend the Broccoli-Watercress Soup - I return to it again and again as the definitive cream of broccoli soup.  If you're not able to brine your Thanksgiving turkey (which is my personal favorite but very time consuming), the recipe and cooking method in this book is the next best thing.

I'm generally a romance reader, but the mystery half of this novel really engaged me and was a nice change of pace.  I think the romance side of the story suffered a bit for me because I hadn't read the previous books and wasn't up on on the history of the characters' relationship.

I was very impressed with the first half of this book.  It is the story of a former colonel in the Iranian air force who hopes that buying a house at a tax sale will allow him to recapture the lifestyle he and his family enjoyed in Iran.  The only problem is that the house was wrongfully foreclosed upon, and the former owner, Kathy,  desperately wants it back.  Kathy is a recovering addict who was already at a perilous point in her life.  I thought that the author did a particularly good job of portraying the despair, diminished dreams and routine humiliations faced by immigrants in modern day America.  I also thought Kathy initially showed some promise.  Would she or wouldn't she be able to avoid all the wrong choices that she knows are waiting for her?<br />The second half of the book left me cold.  Frankly, I skipped part of the middle.  Kathy wants the house back, Colonel wants to keep - how much more is there to say?  As with many of the other reviewers, the ending just didn't work for me.  By then Kathy and her beau Les had become such unsympathetic characters that I really couldn't care less whether or not they got the house back, and I didn't much care if the colonel got to keep it.  While I believe people can be as stupidly self-destructive as Kathy, this was too much.  <br />I think that the mixed reviews for this book are telling.  There is some very impressive writing mixed in with a very poor plot.  You'll find parts of the book worthwhile, but be prepared for  a letdown at the end.	2001-02-27

This isn't one of those exhaustive travel books that tells you everything there is to know about a place.  Instead, the authors selectively present everything you actually need to know.  The dining section was particularly helpful.  It wasn't an exhaustive list of restaurants, but it did give you a choice of a few places in each category.  The authors were also good about pointing out where the locals go and warning you about the places that are for tourists only.  Even better, they distinguish between the tourist places that are all hype and those that are still worth seeing.  The maps were helpful, and the book is small enough to fit into a purse or pocket.  You will eat well and have a great time in New Orleans with nothing but this book to guide you.	2001-02-20

If that's OK with you, you're going to enjoy this book.<br />Beatrice Small's story has elements of both the romanance and the fantasy genres.  Her premise - a female dominated society where men are little more than sex slaves - is not particularly original, but she has fun with it and it's an entertaining quick read.  As for the Susan Johnson story, all of her standard bits are here, but they don't add up to much of a story.  In fact, I never could understand why the characters were doing whatever they were doing.  In a book like this I'm willing to cut the authors some slack, but this one just didn't make sense. The offering from Thea Devine didn't appeal to me, but others may like it.  The true gem of this book is Robin Schone's contribution.  There's not much plot here, but that's OK.  The emphasis is solely on the characters, and Schone makes it work.  Despite the length constraints of the novella format, she creates two of the best written characters you are likely to see in any romance.  I've read other pieces by Schone, and this is her best work.	2001-02-16
US	52027938	R35U0HJUKJS9EN	0441006329	251318464	The Color of Distance	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Very imaginative first contact story.	Amy Thomson has created an amazingly complete and complex alien culture in &quot;The Color of Distance.&quot;  The story is about Juna, a human explorer inadvertently stranded on an alien planet.  She is rescued by the Tendu, a sentient race that adopts and cares for her until the humans will return and take her back to earth.  Most of the plot is about Juna and the Tendu mutually discovering the fascinating differences between their two cultures.  By far the most impressive part of the novel is Thomson's vivid description of the Tendu people and planet.  She has skillfully created a complete cultural matrix that is very different from our own but that nevertheless makes sense in its own right.  Particularly interesting was Juna's gradual discovery of the Tendu life cycle.  That alone makes the book worth reading.  <br />Even though I was impressed with that part of the book, I don't  think the book is much more than a fun, entertaining read.  There are no great themes here, and Thomson barely brushes upon the moral dilemmas inherent in the mutual discovery of other cultures.  For a truly brilliant handling of that theme, read &quot;The Sparrow&quot; by Mary Doria Russell.  My other complaint about &quot;The Color of Distance&quot; is that the ending was very cursory and little more than a set up for the sequel.  Despite that, this is a fun read.	2001-02-15

I remember reading and really enjoying this book many years ago and was looking forward to re-reading it when I recently came across a copy.  This time around the story didn't work for me, and I think it's because the premise - young adults have single night of passion, are forced to marry, live together celibately and eventually discover that they are in love - doesn't ring true for today's audience.  Other authors have made this work in more recent books, for example Susan Elizabeth Phillips, but it's just too simplistic here.  Spencer is a very accomplished writer and I continue to enjoy many of her books, but this one hasn't stood the test of time.  However, I do think that it might appeal more to younger readers who are just discovering romance novels.	2001-02-13

I've read a lot of romance novels and lusted after a fair number of heros, but Cal Bonner is the only one I wanted to lift whole from the book and take home for my very own.  He's incredible - a star quarterback with a killer body, tremendous wit, an impressive intellect and great values.  Sure, he can get a little grumpy and stubborn, but usually in a sexy, kind of adorable way.  Thank goodness Susan Elizabeth Phillips created Jane Darlington, a woman worthy of Cal.  Jane is an egghead physicist intent upon finding a physicially perfect but intellectually challenged sperm doner.  She mistakenly assumes that Cal is going to fill the bill, but boy is she wrong.  The ensuing struggle between these two is hilarious, touching and very sexy.  SEP always writes great books, but this is one of her very best.  Even if you're not a big romance reader, I promise that you're going to love this book!	2001-02-11

I must say I had my doubts aobut this one - I didn't think there was any way I could get excited about a hero named &quot;Bobby Tom&quot; who wears a cowboy hat, but I shouldn't have worried.  As always, SEP has managed to create a great story, unique characters, laugh-out-loud dialogue and sexy love scenes.  Bobby Tom is a football star forced into retriement by a career-ending injury, and beneath lots of good ol' boy charm, he's not too happy about it.  Not knowing what to do with his life, he agrees to star in a movie.  The producers are justifiably concerned about this infamous playboy's reliability, so they hire a babysitter - the none too tempting Gracie Snow.  The resulting relationship is just great.<br />SEP succeeds at doing a lot of things in this book that usually turn me off in a romance novel.  First, I don't like unattractive heroines that either miraculously become beautiful, but Gracie's transformation into a cute, perky and kind of sexy leading character works.  Second, as a former Texan I usually can't stand the loud, folksy stereotype that Bobby Tom initially appears to be.  However, SEP managed to make it work without being silly and does a good job portraying smalltown Texas.  I still refuse to picture Bobby Tom wearing a great big cowboy hat, but if it works for you...  Third, there is a secondary romance between two older characters, and I usually find that distracts from the main plot.  Here it's so well done and flows so seamlessly into the main storyline that I was glad to see it.  There are few authors who never fail to deliver, and Susan Elizabeth Phillips certainly falls into that category!	2001-02-11

Not only does Catherine Anderson do a great job creating wonderful characters and a very moving love story, but she also tells a great tale.  She has a particular talent for creating great heroes that seem like ordinary guys, but when it comes time to protect or defend their mates, they show an amazing depth of caring and commitment without turning all wishy-washy.  Heath Masters is a perfect example.  &quot;Forever After&quot; is about Meredith and her daughter, Sammy, who are in hiding from some shady characters from their past.  They happen to move next to Heath, a very sexy small town sheriff, and his dog.  Meredith's stringent refusal to accept his neighborly advances only whet Heath's curiosity.  Little does he know that Meredith and Sammy are going to lead his life in all sorts of unexpected directions.

It is the story of Harley, a nineteen year old singlehandedly raising his three sisters after his mother is imprisoned for killing their father.  Not only is he struggling to support his family, but he is also grappling with a family legacy of abuse, the magnitude of which is initially unclear.  Harley is one of the most complex characters in modern fiction.  He is simultaneously heroic, pathetic, frightening, sympathetic and abhorent.  The increasingly awful events in his life and the overwhelming responsibilities he has assumed magnify the usual child/adult dichotomy common to his age.  <br />Sensitive readers should be forwarned that there are many unpleasant issues in this book - child abuse, adultery, incest.  Nevertheless, O'Dell is a compelling storyteller and does an excellent job of making you care about the fate of her characters.  It's interesting to compare this book to Wally Lamb's &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot;.  Both books are about a man trying to maintain his sanity despite a tramatic past and in the face of horrendous circumstances.  O'Dell's book is by far the darker of the two and in many ways the more realistic.  Lamb's book is about the anguish of living with a schizophrenic identical twin, not an everyday occurence.  O'Dell's premise - children left to fend for themselves after their sole surviving parent is imprisoned - is unfortunately more common than we care to believe.  I did think the ending of &quot;Back Roads&quot; was overdone, but not so much as to overshadow the finesse of the rest of the book.	2001-02-06

On the one hand, Legendary Lover is filled with Johnson's trademark sensuality and historical research.  On the other hand, this book is virtually identical to the two other Johnson books I have read.  Johnson has found a successful formula and sticks very closely to it.  The hero and heroine meet, they immediately jump into bed for lots of intense sex, the hero virtually kidnaps the heroine and takes her to his private hermitage by a river where they spend a week or so running around naked and having lots more sex and then - 100 pages into the book - some sort of plot emerges.  What is it with these river houses?  If you've enjoyed the Johnson formula in the past, you'll probably like this one, too.  I do have one major complaint about the book, though.  I was really appalled by the fact that the hero repeatedly ignored the heroine's desire to use birth control.  Not acceptable today, not acceptable then.  No matter how urgent the circumstance.	2001-02-05

Reading this book is like going to live in someone else's skin for a week.  Not that it's always a comfortable place to be.  Dominick Birdsey, the central character, is a man trying to retain his sanity while he deals with the continuous calamities that keep befalling him and his family, most at the hand of his schizophrenic identical twin.  (Apologies for the pun.) At it's heart this is a story about how peace and maturity come from accepting one's heritage, for better or worse.  I've tried to recommend this book to friends, but they've been turned off by the subject-matter.  However, even when Dominick's life is at its nadir, the book is such a compelling read that you can't put it down.  You'll be glad you didn't.

Picking up this book was like attending a family reunion.  I had that same sense of visiting with people I hadn't seen in years but still cared about.  You want to reminisce and catch up on what everyone's been up to.  It's been years since I read Texasville and over a decade since I read The Last Picture Show.  Nevertheless, I was immediately able to fall back into the rhythms of Thalia, Texas.  &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; picks up several years after Texasville and once again focuses on Duane Moore and his family.  The book opens with Duane's decision to give up motorized vehicles, a move that shocks the entire town and throws Duane's wife into a panic. Pedestrians, you see, are unheard of in Thalia.  Typical of McMurtry's novels, the dialogue is extremely funny and true to life.  McMurtry has an amazing ability to point out the ridiculousness of most human behavior without demeaning his characters.  And he thoroughly captures the eccentricities of small town life.  Even though this is basically a story about regrets and missed oportunities, it never becomes melancholy or dismal.  This is a stronger book that Texasville, but no less entertaining.  I highly recommend this book for all McMurtry fans, especially if you've read the rest of the trilogy.	2001-02-01

I loved The Liar's Club, and anticipated an equally strong reaction to Mary Karr's second autobiography.  However, this book never engaged me.  Even though it was an autobiography, The Liar's Club had a clear plot and theme.  This book does not.  The first 70 pages read as a series of vignettes, with no coherent story emerging from the compilation.  I finally gave up and didn't finish the book - a rarity for me.  It's not that the writing was affirmatively bad.  Karr's poetic prose is still very clever, and her ability to potently describe her characters is as strong as ever.  I just never could get interested in the story.	2001-01-31

This is by far the best first novel by any author that I've ever read.  You will fall in love with the characters, including the Lexie, the most vivid child I've ever seen in a romance novel.  As a Texan transplanted to Seattle, I could obviously relate to Georgianne, but I was surprised at how much I loved John, the professional hockey player.

The plot turns the usual romance formula on its head.  Here, the heroine, Rowena Belleme, must seduce a very unwilling hero, Warrick deChaville.  Later, Warrick vows to seek revenge, but despite his best plans, he cannot resist Rowena.  One of my favorite things about this book is that Warrick is not a modern male lurking in medieval clothing.  He's a medieval warrior - he's violent, he treats his daughters as nothing more than chattel and he considers women to be little more than sexual conveniences.  Not that those are good things; it's just more realistic for the time period.  It is a sign of Lindsey's talent as a writer that she is able to work within these limitations and still create an appealing romance.	2001-01-28

The ensuing Odyssean voyage challenges the crew's perceptions about God and morality. The result is a divine exploration of the theory that religion is the opiate of the masses. <br />As original as the story is, it never quite rises to the grandeur of its themes, which isn't necessarily a criticism.

I think that just about anything is better with cheese, so this book is right up my alley.  Even if you aren't a cheese addict, you will find this book to be an interesting and useful resource.  The book is divided into two basic parts:  an encyclopedia of cheese types and recipes with cheese as a principal ingredient.  The encyclopedia is amazingly thorough - both in the varieties of cheese discussed and in their analysis of the history and processes behind them.  I particularly liked that the authors organized their presentation of cheeses into categories and subcategories of similar cheeses.  Very useful.  Also, it was nice that they included some of the more pedestrian cheese varities.  Too often books like this focus exclusively on varities that are rare and exotic - these specialties are fun for special occassions and to read about, but they are frequently hard to find and not always practical for everyday cooking.  Even though the recipes are not particularly flashy, they are well-designed to showcase special characteristics of the applicable cheeses.  A lot of effort clearly went into this book, and it pays off.  Oh, and lots of nice color pictures to browse through.	2001-01-26

Two separate stories are interwoven throughout the book.  One is the first-person accout by a photojournalist, Jean, who has sailed to the Isle of Shoals with her husband, daughter, brother-in-law and his girlfriend in order to research the murder of two Norwegian immigrants that occured on the island of Smuttynose in the nineteenth century.  The second is the translated diary of the survivor/witness of the murder.  <br />Jean's story never worked for me.  All of the characters were so unappealing and boring that I really couldn't care less what happened to any of them.  The underlying theme of grief, recriminations and regret is handled much better in Shreve's book &quot;The Pilot's Wife.&quot;<br />The diary was somewhat more engaging.  Shreve is an English professor, and she has devised what appears to be a scholarly exercise for herself.  The murders actually happened, and Shreve has used the transcript of trial of the man accussed of the crimes verbatim.  From these historical bones she crafts her own plausible version of what happened.  Even though this sounds like a promising basis for a story, its execution is surprisingly flat.  Shreve does do a wonderful job of conveying the grueling and tedious nature of a fisherman's wife in the nineteenth century.  The problem is that it is grueling and tedious to read about as well.  As with the companion story, none of the characters were particularly interesting.  I just couldn't buy Maren's obsession with her brother, and without that the rest of the story doesn't work.	2001-01-26

If you are a fan of euphemism and are turned off by candid, almost clinical, love scenes, this book is not for you.<br />The heroine in this book, Elizabeth Petrie, is the sexually frustrated wife of a prominent politician who has avoided sleeping with her for 12 years.  In an effort to woo him away from an imagined mistress and to satisfy her own needs, she asks Ramiel Devington to teach her how to entice and satisfy a man.  Ramiel, a notorious sensualist, eagerly undertakes Elizabeth's education with an eye towards getting her into his own bed.  The ensuing lessons are are a masterpiece of erotic fiction.  Not only is Schone able to build remarkable sexual anticipation, but she does it without the main characters even touching.  It isn't until well into the second half of the book that the two get together.  <br />The remainder of the plot is original, but a little overwrought and gothic in my opinion.  The secondary characters were well-crafted.  Some people may be turned off by the adulterous aspects of Elizabeth and Ramiel's romance.  However, I never thought of their relationship that way.  By the time Elizabeth strays, I thought it was justified by her husband's brutal rejection and realization that the marriage was effectively over.<br />All in all, I found The Lady's Tutor to be a remarkable book and would highly recommend it.  Nevertheless, it is not a book for everyone, and those with delicate sensibilities should look elsewhere.	2001-01-25

If you are already a fan of Beatrice Small, Susan Johnson, Thea Devine or Robin Schone, this collection of novellas will be satisfying.  If, however, you are not familiar with these authors, be forewarned that this is not tepid stuff.  These ladies are known for their graphic portrayal of increasingly erotic sex, so this book is not for everyone.  <br />Unlike other reviewers, I thought that Robin Schone's novella was the highlight of the book.  It was the only one that had fully developed characters with identifiable motives.  Yes, it is an unusual and unconventional story - you don't read many romances with an eunuch for the hero - but Ms. Schone makes it work.  In order to adapt an erotic romance into the novella format, the author must have a speedy means for getting the two main characters together.  Ms. Schone's plot is simple:  the heroine is a sexual frustrated widow who decides to pose as a prostitute for one night; the hero is a eunuch who wants to sample a taste of the erotic arts he has been denied all his life.  From this simple premise Ms. Schone is able to craft a intense and complex relationship.  <br />In comparison, the other three novellas are rather shallow.  Ms. Small's premise (an independent woman is turned over to a sexual &quot;master&quot; as punishment for rejecting various suitors) has promise, but the character's are sadly two-dimensional.  Also, the overwrought purple prose can frequently be outright silly.  Plot and character motivation are completely lacking in the other two stories.  In both an attractive couple immediately jump into bed, have lots and lots of sex, and instantly decide that they are in love.  No emotional build-up, no tension, no nothing.  <br />Despite my reservations about three out of the four novellas, I'm still giving this book four stars on the basis of Schone's strong contribution.	2001-01-24

For the first 300 pages, this is a great book that thoroughly engages you in another world.  While the plot and characters are all well done, the highlight of this book is the author's wonderful depicition of the Congo.  Not only does she do a wonderful job of evoking the setting, but she also skillfully interweaves the historical and political background of the region.  This will be a welcome discovery for most readers.    Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the first two thirds of the book was tempered by the incredibly long resolution.  Without spoinling it for new readers, there is a definite point where the primary plot is resolved.  The rest of the book felt like one big afterword to me.  Yes, I had become invested in the lives of the primary characters, and it was nice to find out what happened to them.  However, the tension and drama of the original storyline was gone.	2001-01-24

Gray has got to be one of the all-time hottest romantic heroes.	2000-11-28
