It seems that this book is a case of I will go and have wild fun and than write about how bad it is. He had wild sex with one of the hot porn stars of the moment who had some bad problems with life in general and the porn business as a whole but he does not care because you get wild monkey sex with a star. She kills herself and he feels bad.<br />I cannot think of anyone that would keep this book out for guest to see or your children. Well maybe if you are a swinger. The pictures are tactfully done. You may not think so if you do not like nudity or think that it should not be in a book. Let me state that I have no problem with nudity or the porn business as a whole but this book is trash. And it is not because of the pictures or the subject of the book. It is because of the written commentary. I have to give this review 1 star only because of the nudity, instead of the zero stars it deserves.	2001-05-21

She had already it and wanted me to read it. I did and I was really pleased with it.<br />Ensler explains that she is worried about the state of a world that cannot say VAGINA without blushing, but has hundreds of slang words for penis. This book is a collection of stories that were told to Ensler by hundreds of women from all walks of life who she interviewed. Some of the stories are verbatim what the women had to say about their vaginas, while Ensler takes more artistic licence with some.<br />There are stories about masturbation, sex, childbirth, rape, and many other things. Every way that our vaginas affect our lives, as women, are covered with a humorous or touching story. A great deal of this book is filled with humorous stories about nicknames for out vaginas and how women think about their own vaginas, but there is a disturbing rape scene in one of the stories. Although this story was incredibly disturbing, it is totally understandable why it was included: Rape, whether it is spoken of or not, is a tangible part of many women's vaginas.  All in all, The Vagina Monologues is an excellent book for any woman or any man who loves vaginas. Vaginas are one of the most underappreciated entities in our lives. Vaginas provide pleasure for our mates, pleasure for ourselves, the means for conception, and most importantly-birth. Most of us came into this world through a vagina. While this isn't a self-help book and it won't help you deal with specific problems with your vagina, it can help you learn to see your vagina in a whole new light.	2001-05-20

I have to agree that there are some aspects of the book I liked.

But I enjoyed reading it.<br />The story begins with a deadly superflu virus, aka &quot;Captain Trips&quot; being accidentally released from a government lab. This virus proceeded to wipe out most everyone except for a selected few that were to be summoned to either the good side or the bad side. The bad being of course, (the devil) Randall Flagg(aka &quot;The Walking Dude&quot;) And the good (representing God) being &quot;Mother Abigail&quot;, a 108 (I believe) year old lady that sat on her porch for the most part, invading the characters dreams with visions of herself as well did the Walking Dude contribute to their dreams as well. These dreams would come to the people in the form of the here and now and instructing them where they needed to go next and what they had to do. Scary stuff if you ask me.<br />The good side met at Mother Abigails and the bad side met in Vegas. Eventually the good travels to Vegas to confront Randall Flagg and do the ultimate battle. Flaggs group was going to set off a nuke war head..and just as it was to blast off a very huge hand (being the hand of God)came down from the sky and suppressed it, thus destroying the bad. It made chills run up and down my spine.<br />The main characters of this book were as follows:&quot;The good&quot;: Mother Abigail, Stu Redman, girlfriend Frannie, Larry Underwood, Ralph Brentner, Nick Andros, Tom Cullen and Richard Farris.<br />The most prominent characters of the bad was: Randall Flagg (The Walking Dude), Nadine Cross, which I suppose you could call his wife, if you will. A dude that was totally nuts and a pyro freak called Trash-Can Man and The Walking Dudes right hand man Lloyd. There were other characters though none as memorable as these. Flagg will just scare the pants off you with his changing features. Handsome at one point and then of course his &quot;true colors&quot; at another. Hideous to say the least.<br />I would recommend this book (or themovie) to anyone that wants a little fantasy realism mixed with horror. The description of the effects that the virus had on people will astonish you with its vividness. The personal stories of each individual will make you feel as though you know them and are traveling right beside them. A book that is well worth the read.	2001-05-20

Not only does the author take the time to explain even the most basic of sexual positions and situations, but time is spent explaining other aspects such as sexually transmitted diseases and performance problems. I think it is obvious to most people that if the man can't perform, he either needs to get some drugs or hot sex is never going to happen. And as for sexually transmitted diseases, please. I think the generation that this book is targeted towards has heard enough about std's to last them until they die of AIDS. I have to agree that there are some aspects of the book I liked. Her catagories on how to vary sex, and how to increase comfort level for those who are less experienced are rather interesting. Overall, I would have to say that one can gain all the useful information from this book by flipping to the good sections.

My professor gave us three choices to pick from, lesbians, gay men or STD's. I choice lesbians and read many books, saw several documentaries and even did some interviews. I learned so much about lesbians and started reading wonderful books such as this one.<br />This exquisite collection features some of the finest erotic writing around, and shows why the series has grown by leaps and bounds since its first edition was published in 1996. Every single story here is top notch, full of extremely sexy writing that also has something to say about life. Some are authors who are extremely well-known (and well-loved): Pat Califia, Joan Nestle, Cecilia Tan, Kate Bornstein, Jane DeLynn; others are newcomers or authors whose names may not be familiar yet, but whose work assures that they will be.<br />The level of their work proves that this truly is the&quot;best of the best.&quot; I'm talking about classic stories, like Cecilia Tan's &quot;Penetration,&quot; stories that are just so brilliant, they deserve to be read over and over again. Tristan Taormino has culled from the previous year's collections those stories that are full of all the heat, spark and sizzle of lesbian sexuality. She has also gone beyond the bounds of what is traditionally known as &quot;erotica&quot; -- some of these stories don't feature naked flesh pressed up against naked flesh, though most of them do. Some of these stories are sad, wistful, angry, confused. Some are subtle in their meaning, reaching for nuances far beyond the typical porn orgasm. Taormino also extends lesbian eroticism to encompass butch/femme, S/M, and transgender sexuality in a way that is truly remarkable.<br />Heather Seggal's story, &quot;When He Was Mary,&quot; is one of the sexiest and most moving examples of transgender erotica I've read, capturing the narrator's conflicting feelings over her lover's transformation from female to male as well as the love they still share. In Toni Amato's excellent entry, &quot;A Girl Like That,&quot; a butch teaches a lesson to a hot femme who's been strutting her stuff.<br />I reread some of these stories many times, especially the ones I'd already fallen in love with in previous collections. They stand out as truly original, sexy, provocative writing. Who could not remember &quot;Just Drops,&quot; where a bottom learns just how dangerous water can be? It's this creativity, the capturing of the ordinary and the extraordinary and turning each into sexual fodder, all with writing that truly takes the reader into the heart of the story, that sets this collection apart. This volume is an excellent introduction to the series or a welcome addition to a well-stocked erotica collection. I heartily recommend this it to any fan of erotica, lesbian or not. You will surely find something here that will turn you on and leave you hungry for more.	2001-05-20

This book claims to have good tasting easy to make recipes from all around the world-WRONG! The only thing this book has is pretty models that are half dressed. The recipes are not easy to make, they are quite complicated and take way to long to prepare. And after you're done, you'll notice that you just prepared a dish with as much fat or as many calories as any other regular dish.

One day, I came home tired and stressed after a big test. He had me lay down and he slowly, gently, and in a very erotic fashion, started massaging me. He started at the top and worked his way down, he then had me turn around(faced up) and he started massaging the front of my body. He must have not gotten half ways through the massage before I was so excited, I could barely contain myself. He stopped at different parts of my body and gave those areas special attention. It was a very satisfying and erotic experience. We did not have sex, but I certainly had several orgasms and I slept like a baby. I have since read this book and  we often treat each other to  a VERY relaxing, yet erotically charged massage.	2001-02-02

I was disappointed with this book, but I wanted to voice my opinion as to why. I didn't want to just say it was stupid like the other reader did. The majority of this book covers nail and hair tips, none of which are anything more than common sense. There's one chapter on skin care, which I did find interesting and informative. The book references white women, so if you're a women of color, you might not find any useful information. Although I'm white, my skin is dark, so I felt that I was at a loss here. The book does dedicate one chapter to women with darker skin, but it really doesn't offer anything useful. What I hated most about this book was it's format. It's written as a question and answer guide. Some people do prefer that type of book, I don't because you don't really get explantions in detail. The book was not a total waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend to someone, unless it was given to you as a gift or you bought it used.	2001-01-11

US	48483577	RE0VR9ASYWXAE	1886039496	61095147	Living with PCOS: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Very informative	I read this book and found it be very informative. It's written in plain english with no big complicated words, therefore easy for any person to read.   Through study, I have found that there are many women out there who suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome and they don't know alot about the disorder , which  causes irregular menstrual cycles, excess facial and body hair, weight gain, and adult acne. It's also a leading cause of infertility and if left untreated, the condition carries long term risk for endometrial cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.   This book sheds light on the condition, it explains it well, talks about over-coming symptoms, choosing a doctor, getting diagnosed and coping with the emotional impact. I think the book is very informative and I highly recommend it to all women, if you don;t suffer from polcystic ovary syndrome, chances are you might know someone who does.	2000-12-15
US	48483577	R35UGK85MY79GZ	0694524069	648069616	Wild Justice	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Fast paced and exciting	Wild, exciting, full of suspense and very fast paced. I loved it. I bought the audio cassette and it might not have been a good idea to listen to it while driving to work. I was so into it that I found myself driving a little erratic. The story is filled with suspense and I kept thinking, I knew who the killer was. Just the thought of people waking up with missing organs or beind killed and their organs stolen is a scary thought. The plot thickens as the story goes on and it's filled with twists. I really got into it.	2000-12-15

The whole book is shallow, the women only have sex, money, designer clothes and off the wall fantansies on their minds. This book was not worth the money or time.	2000-12-14

My boyfriend invited several of his co-workers over for a coctail party and I dazzled them with my wonderful, good tasting finger foods, hot and cold appetizers and pastas. They were all easy to make and fast, they looked so pretty and didn't last at all. This book has well over 100 different easy to make recipes, some of the wives are calling me and asking for my recipes...	2000-12-14

For one the book is very short, it concentrates most on facial massages which is ok, but it does nothing to target facial excercies. I have found that through good and consistent facial excercises you can  prevent forehead wrinkles, laugh lines and baggy eyelids.   Some people might find this book interesting or helpful, but I was not impressed. Good infromational books that I can highly recommend are-&quot;Timeless Face&quot;, this is a great book that thoroughly covers fingertip facial massages, facial excercises and general facial care tips. It has wonderful color pictures and in-depth useful explanations that are easy to follow. Another great book is &quot;Facelift&quot;, this book offers great tips on how just a few minutes a day can erase years off a women's face. Facial massages are beneficial to every women's face, but like our bodies, we need excercise to keep everything toned, that includes our facial muscles.	2000-12-13

My boyfriend bought me this book, but he should have read some of the customer reviews before he bought it. . . Book content:Jewels becomes curious about exotic dancing after she discovers her husband frequents strip clubs. Later, she divorces him and becomes a stripper. She talks about her disruptive upbringing, a boyfriend who leaves her and the different clubs she worked at. She offers basic tips on how to strip. Unfortunately, the author jumps from subject to subject and it's not clear as to what her point is. The grammar is bad and the sentence structure is way off. The tips on exotic dancing are not explained well and therefore, I'm not clear as to what she means. The beauty tips are nothing more than common sense. I found the small part on sexy clothes somewhat useful. I agree with the other readers that the book has way too many useless checklists and the author should not have wasted a whole chapter on nightclub rules and regulations.	2000-12-12

It offers tips on fuller lips,  more sensuous eye,  more prominent cheekbones and  complete makeover advise. The book includes good  advise on nutrition, exercise, hair, and dress and it caters to women from all walks of life, from models to moms, teenagers to seniors, women of all colors and sizes. It has lots of before and after pictures.  The book is well written and easy to read. I live in California and I'm always in the sun. This book will certainly help me protect my face against the suns rays. It's a good book and I highly recommend it to all women.	2000-12-11

From garter belts, to satin gowns, to thongs and one piece little see throughs, they're all beautiful.  The book has nice illustrations and talks about lingerie from the early days to now, but the book does not cover all the basics.  The book, in my opinion is worth reading if you want to know the basics on lingerie, nothing else.  As a part-time model, I have found that lingerie does not fit all women, even if they have flawless bodies. This book does nothing to suggest what would look better on tall women, skinny women or women with large/small breasts. I did like the book, but I felt like it was very basic and missing alot of useful information.	2000-12-11

The book is about the bears getting a new puppy and along with that comes new responsibilities and learning how to cope with the puppy and give it the attention it requires. Caring for the new puppy is hard work, but they realize that the work is well worth it when they consider all the love and affection they receive from their wonderful pet.

I read this book while pregnant with my son. The information contained here was not of value to me. The authors either put down men or somehow gives the reader the idea that men are of no use or help to us when we're pregnant. The part about breastfeeding was somewhat interesting and useful, but nothing else in this book was of any use to me.	2000-12-06
