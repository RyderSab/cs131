She couldn't possibly hope to match the sheer man power or size of the fleets at sea and hope to dominant world affairs. England would always end up playing catch up with Spain, France and other European powers with better resources. Intelligence and spying seemed to offer the key to help the islands in the Atlantic to dominate the world of politics. Queen Elizabeth turned to people like Sir Francis Walsingham.<br /><br />Walsingham may not have invented spying or been the ultimate spymaster but he honed it to a fine art as did others in Queen Elizabeth's court. This was the time when monarchy was absolute rule after all and anything hinting at dissent was met swiftly and usually resulted in death. Author Stephen Budiansky has made this period fascinating by grafting a breezy style to this story. While people think they know a lot about the Elizabethan era in England, usually it's bits and pieces gleaned from studying Shakespeare or a course in college on the history of England during this time. The spying and doublecrosses that went on during this era are largely unknown to the average reader and, as a result, this may prove enlightening and entertaining.<br /><br />This isn't written for academics. Like a lot of history books written for popular consumption this book escapes the dry, stilted text that makes you feel like you're buried in undergraduate classes again and it does bring to light an era largely forgotten by others and it makes it exciting. Based on what I know of the period, Budiansky does a good job with his scholarship and manages to make history---gasp!---entertaining as well as enlightening.	2005-09-02

They could never escape their ironic name. Founded by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Andy Hummel and Jody Stephens, they appeared to be poised to take the rock world by storm in 1972. Critical acclaim and great songwriting didn't translate into sales when a lousy distribution deal with Stax went bad. Chris Bell (Chilton's songwriting partner and the second lead singer in the band) left after little more than a handful of gigs. The band solidered on with a second critically acclaimed album before becoming mired in drugs, alcohol and despair.<br /><br />The most tragic story this side of Badfinger, Big Star never tasted the success of their storied British counterparts in the power-pop movement. Chilton who had been the lead singer in The Box Tops has never been able to escape the shadow of what might have been and was viewed as a has-been by the industry before he was 25. Bell came to an untimely end after surfacing from a dark time in his life where his bisexuality (or homosexuality depending upon who's telling the story)and uncertainty pushed him to depend on drugs to escape. He recorded a great album that didn't see a release until over a decade after his death.<br /><br />Big Star may have never lived up to the hopeful title of their first album (\\"#1 Record\\")but they changed the face of rock music nonetheless. Author Rob Jovanovic does a terrific job of detailing their fall and the indifference of the industry that surrounded them. His book relies on new interviews with Stephens, Hummell and others (Although Chilton refused to be interviewed)to tell the story and give perspective on the band's failure to thrive. Featuring a detailed discography and copious notes, \\"Big Star: The Short Life, Painful Death and Unexpected Resurrection of the Kings of Power Pop\\" is as well written and researched as the great Badfinger biography \\"Without you\\".	2005-08-30
US	52569116	R1VYFRMZ7FLEW8	0380978946	282659637	Olympos	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Fine if overlong sequel that is a shade disappointing	\\"Illum\\" was a challenging novel. Simmons wove strands of Greek mythlogy, science fiction, classical literature in a way that commanded respect and clearly set the stage for a blockbuster sequel. Unfortunately, \\"Olympos\\" can't quite live up to the set up from Simmons' previous much better novel. In reality, they're both clearly part of the same much larger novel just cut in half. Like \\"Dune\\" and many other classics of the genre (not to mention Simmons' own \\"Hyperion\\" novels), the flaws could easily be overlooked if the conclusion wasn't a bit long winded and took detours that might lose lesser readers. Simmons combines elements of classic literature and pulp fiction in an inventive, startling way. In many respects, this is Simmons' \\"Odyssey\\" to the first books \\"Illiad\\" (hence the titles of both books).<br /><br />At the conclusion of \\"Illum\\" (which, by the way, I recommend re-reading before tackling \\"Olympos\\" as Simmons just jumps right in with the story)The Greek army and Trojans on an alternate Earth were fighting the Greek Gods united finally against a common foe instead of fighting each other. Thomas Hockenberry the scholar who had been reporting \\"variations\\" from the Trojan War when compared to Homer's \\"The Illiad\\" no longer worked for the Gods; he has sided with humanity believing that these false gods need to be overthrown.<br /><br />Meanwhile back on the real Earth, the Voynix have begun attacking human settlements after existing as servants for centuries. Setebos the many handed giant brain has landed on Earth and is devouring the planet by draining it of its negative energy. Caliban may have escaped from the space station he was stranded on and Prospero pulls Harman from his home telling him that he's the only hope for humanity but first he must be \\"educated\\".<br /><br />With its continued mixture of great literature, mythology and a complex, vast canvas Simmons' \\"Olympos\\" promises much and initially delivers but about midway through this massive novel his story gets derailed as he tries to tie up all the loose ends of the first novel. While he doesn't do so as successfully as I had hoped, \\"Olympos\\" is still a worthwhile read. Simmons' commands a depth and breadth of knowledge and puts it on display as part of this novel so that, at times, it literally takes your breath away. If it doesn't quite live up to the lofty expectations of \\"Illum\\" perhaps that's because it's been nearly two years since that novel was released creating a large build up and expectation for the sequel.<br /><br />While Simmons does manage to tie up most of the loose ends of the first novel, there's potential for a third book (and perhaps he's planning one). There's considerable backstory in this universe that hasn't been examined and potential in the post-human world as well. I'd like to see him tackle the material again to see what he can come up with. I had guessed much of the conclusion far before reading it (about 1/3 of the way through) and if the audience is too far ahead of the author they can get bored. There are clues throughout the novel hinting at the conclusion just keep your eyes peeled for them. If you want to be totally surprised (or disappointed) by the ending, don't try to draw any conclusions before you reach page 450 when one of the morvec machines lays out the conclusion to the vast mystery. \\"Olympos\\" is a challenging book and that's to Simmons' credit I just wish that he had cut the novel by about 150 pages and made it a leaner, meaner conclusion. He could have done so without sacrificing much of the literary content and still had a compelling more satisfying conclusion to his story.<br /><br />Olympos is an example of an author juggling too many balls, losing track of which ones are going up and which ones coming down. The result is a story where the ball gets dropped as often as it is caught. Nevertheless, so-so Simmons is better than most of the writing out there. I just wish that the storytelling had been more coherentwith a better resolution.	2005-08-24

Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller and many of the military minds that directed the effort to develop the atomic bomb. Nobody outside of Los Alamos knew Dorothy McKibben. McKibben who ran 109 East Palace was like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of this war time \\"Hamlet\\"-like drama; she viewed the action not from the heart of the research but from the outside at the gateway where she issued security passes, helped new personnel settle in, dealt with complaints about water pressure, food supplies, etc. She knew everything and nothing about the community she helped as she wasn't privy to the secret goal of the Los Alamos community.<br /><br />While author Jennet Conant doesn't ignore the work they were trying to accomplish, she focuses on the human element that made it possible for the work to occur. Conant provides a detailed and intimate look into the insular community that labored to build the ultimate bomb to finish the \\"ultimate war\\". One of the most fascinating sections of the book called \\"Summer Lighning\\" deals with Klaus Fuchs who arrived at Los Alamos after doing research for the Manhattan Project on gaseous diffusion. He came to help figure out the implosion problem at the request of Peierls a German physcist working in the US. McKibben never had a suspicion that Fuchs might be betraying the secret work at Los Alamos to the Soviets until it was too late.<br /><br />Conant who it is noted is the granddaughter of James B. Conant (the chief administrator on the Manhattan Project)has a unique insider's perspective. Conant doesn't shy away from the issue about Oppenheimer's loyalty; she reports that Captain Peer de Silva took an immediate dislike to Oppenheimer and believed, based on his file, that Oppenheimer would betray the United States in a hot second. De Silva went so far as to write a memo to Washington stating that very point creating havoc for General Groves the military head of the operation who knew how much they needed Oppenheimer to make the project work. Illustrated with 16 pages of photos showing what life was like inside the camp, Conant's book looks at a pivotal time in history from a very different perspective--the human perspective and she wisely allows this perspective to dominate her book differienating it from others that examine much of the same time and material.ct work.

Robert Oppenheimer	Books	5	106	119	N	N	A compelling portrait of a complex man	Oppenheimer was a man of his time for a time and quickly became a man out of time when he warned with foresight at the dangers of nuclear proliferation. This compelling, well researched biography by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin provides the most complete picture of one of the most enigmatic, charistmatic and iconic figures of the 20th Century. Pulling from a variety of sources, the authors create one of the most complete and compelling portraits of the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\".<br /><br />Following Oppenheimer and his family from his birth, through his work at UC Berkeley, involvement in protesting social injustice and ultimately his leadership of the team that develop the atomic bomb AMERICAN PROMETHUS looks at Oppenheimer flaws and all. Oppenheimer emerged at one of the most morally complex and scientifically rich times in history. His work at Los Alamos with his group of collaborators transformed our world for good and bad. Oppenheimer lived both in the glow of that success and in the shadow of the world he helped usher in for the remainder of his life. The authors present all this information with detailed accounts from Oppenheimer's life. They also relate many of the personal conflicts that Oppenheimer felt while working in one of the most promising and dangerous fields. There's plenty of excerpts from Oppenheimer's letters and comments from contemporaries he both agreed/disagreed with (Teller, Bohr, Strauss and many, many others).<br /><br />When Oppenheimer had his security clearence revoked and he was betrayed by rumour, poor choices and some of his collegues, one of America's brightest and best fell from hero to possible traitor in the eyes of the American public. The controversey and circumstances were much more complex than they appeared on the surface. This book provides much needed balance to a complex life rendered simply by the idealogy that drove (and still does to some extent)America at the time. It was a complex, harsh world full of shadows and, unfortunately, Oppenheimer's reputation through both his beliefs and the beliefs of others around him was dragged gagged and bound into the shadows. Although he often disagreed with the US, he had his own unique sense of patriotism every bit as valid as those that accused him of being an unacceptable risk. When the disagreement about whether or not the Super was going on the authors quote a wonderful discussion. In discussing the moral implications of building a bomb even more destructive than those dropped on Hiroshima, Oliver Buckley (president of Bell Telephone Labs)commented that there was \\"no moral difference between building an atomic bomb and a super\\". James Conant dryly replied, \\"there are grades of morality\\". In a moral black and white world Opponheimer found his claim to fame and also lost himself.unfortunately, Oppenheimer's reputation through both his beliefs and the beliefs of others around him was dragged gagged and bound into the shadows.

One of the guiding lights of The Byrds and the best songwriter/singer in the band, Clark left the band due to ego, conflicts and infighting. Unfortunately, after his soaring success with The Byrds his solo career and later bands never quite took off. John Einarson's terrific biography of Gene features vintage interviews with Clark (he died in 1991), new interviews with his former bandmates, family members and managers to create a picture of a restless creative spirit who clearly wasn't comfortable with the trappings of fame or his own skin for much of his life.<br /><br />Originally the most prolific songwriter in The Byrds and their main focal point, Clark was pushed out of the band by Roger McGuinn and David Crosby as they wanted to write more and sing more. It didn't help that their manager saw McGuinn as the \\"voice\\" of the band (he did sing on their most popular singles). After a disasterous reunion in 1973, Clark continued his solo career producing the legendary \\"No Other\\" album (which still has mixed reactions to this day). The lack of self confidence and set backs that Clark faced (including his stalled solo career) kept him from achieving a sense of balance in his life.<br /><br />My only criticisms of the book is a lack of a detailed discography (particularly of the numerous unreleased tracks that Clark recorded)and a list of all his published songs. Also, the book could have used more photos. Despite this minor flaw, Einarson (who has written for Mojo, Uncut and other music magazines)creates a complete picture of this frequently troubled but talented musician.<br /><br />Music to listen to while reading this: The first three Byrds albums, Clark's Echoes, Roadmaster, White Light (aka Gene Clark), No Other, So Rebellious a Lover (with Carla Olson)and the reissue of the Clark-McGuinn-Hillman album.	2005-04-17

Examining the Mayan culture, the people of Easter Island and others, Diamond presents a thoughtful anaylsis as to how these very different cultures (one isolated with no enemies but a rich land and culture badly overtaxed the other a rich culture that that had many contacts and enemies to complicate their lives)to present models that we can use today to deal with these issues regarding the environment, social pressure and others that face our culture.<br /><br />Diamond's approach argues that none of these cultures were inferior and that they face the same ecological, environmental and, ultimately, social stressors as we do in our world today. He also takes a look at modern societies (including China and Australia)and how they are faring with the 12 modern types of environmental problems. In another section he looks at the good and bad that big business have contributed to the ecology. It's pretty fair balanced overall.<br /><br />Diamond suggests that societies ultimately choose to fail or succeed based on their problem solving skills, ability to be flexible and change prior to crisis mode. Essentially we can either be victims or lead the charge for change. I didn't feel that an examination of past cultures was a flaw like some reviewers; he examines them in more depth because we already know the outcome and can more clearly trace the evoltionary path that led to their undoing. That path shows up again when examining our modern world and the ways that we are both feeding choas and living with the resources we have as a nation and world. His point about how important it is to understand all of this in a globalized culture seems valid; there are too many interconnected countires now (unlike the Easter Island situation where they were, essentially, isolated and didn't have an impact on other cultures when they finally fell)and if one falls, ultimately, it will have a domino effect on other countries as well putting our world at peril and not just one or two countries.<br /><br />A warning about Diamond's book seems appropriate. It can be read by the lay person but the dense material might be daunting for some people. Skimming the book may give you can idea of the content but it won't have the same profound impact on your view of the world as reading it from cover to cover. I agree with Diamond's viewpoint on a single important point--change and flexibility will help a society thrive and a society that remains static, denies what occurs around it will fail.alls, ultimately, it will have a domino effect on other countries as well putting our world at peril and not just one or two countries.  <br /> <br />A warning about Diamond's book seems appropriate.

King's final volume in The Dark Tower jumps off the bridge we were at in Song of Susannah. Jake and Callahan find the Dixie Pig and discover a chamber filled with horros they can't imagine. \\"Mia\\" gives birth to her chap and Jake follows in hopes of saving her. Roland and Eddie are on their own journey still trapped in the \\"real\\" world trying to find a way to Susannah and save her. She's been taken to a birthing room of sorts where, once she gives birth to Mordred, her life will be forfeit. All of this occurs in the first 40 pages of the novel and with 805 more to go you know that King has quite a tale to tell. I enjoyed Michael Whelan's illustrations and, while I liked all the illustrators that worked on the preceding books, Whelan's have always been the best representation to me of King's world. It's only fitting that he should illustrate the last book since he illustrated the first as well.<br /><br />As to the fate of Randall Flagg, well I didn't find it to be fitting for an ongoing character but it did seem to work within the context of the book.  For those of you looking for plot spoilers look elsewhere I'm not a fan of this practice when it comes to books so you'll have to cast your vote for someone else if that's the case. I'd agree that the book does ramble on a bit too long. However, King never has been known for his brevity.<br /><br />I both satisfied and dissatisfied with The Dark Tower. The conclusion was satisfying in the same way that a terrific meal can be as you push your away from the kitchen table. The dissatisfaction arises from the fact that you know the meal is over and maybe every dish did not turn out exactly as you had wanted it to but, overall, things were quite tasty. The good news is that there's always leftovers in the form of the central books and all the connecting stories. So if you haven't jumped into the offshoots of The Dark Tower series by all means do so. Most of the books that are connected are terrific so you'll be able to relive little moments just like the leftovers from a memorable meal.<br /><br />The end of King's tale isn't perfect. Does it end exactly the way I wanted it to? No but it does provide more closure than I expected. On the other hand, the end seemed a bitter pill to swallow compared to the previous 800 pages. Maybe King was just exhausted and couldn't come up with a more satisfying ending for himself. Maybe he felt this literary trick was the best way to conclude the series which was his bid for an epic tale. Either way, the series and the book is, as a whole, satisfying with some moments I didn't care for.cted are terrific so you'll be able to relive little moments just like the leftovers from a memorable meal.

Roland and Eddie must find Tower so that the purchase of the vacant lot where the Rose is can be completed. Jake and Callahan must track down where Tower has gone into hiding.<br /><br />The sixth book (and next to last book) in Stephen King's sprawling series (which features six main books with 15 other King novels interrelated either through situations or characters to the main six novels)continues the ka-tet's journey to the Dark Tower in an attempt to save the worlds from destruction. SONG OF SUSANNAH is considerably shorter with a breezier pace (which will allow you to catch your breath for the final massive novel of the series). It's perfectly satisfying although it's a little weird when Stephen King shows up as a character in this book (much as SALEM'S LOT shows up in WOLVES OF CALLAH confusing Father Callahan who is a major character in that novel).<br /><br />There's a lot more action in SONG OF SUSANNAH than in WOLVES. So for those that were disappointed at the slower pace of WOLVES, SUSANNAH will provide a nice change of pace. If you're new to this series, King doesn't provide the overview that he did with the other novels at the beginning but he does remind you of certain events from previous novels where possible. My suggestion is to start with THE GUNSLINGER and dip your toe in the water and work your way through the first four novels one at a time before deciding if you're going to dive in completely.<br /><br />As usual King's style makes for easy reading. A very good novel, SONG OF SUSANNAH sets up the final novel in the series with a strong series of interesting conflicts. Enjoy!eading.

Didn't get reconnected with it until the third book in the series was published. While the series is uneven, the best of King's saga work on an epic scale that he hasn't really attempted with any other novels/sagas.<br /><br />Roland the last gunslinger has one final mission; to prevent the destruction of our world and the alternate Earths that exist. If he fails the world will fall into chaos under the spell of evil. Along the way he recruits Eddie a former drug addict, Jake a boy who Roland let die in his pursuit of the Man in Black but who he later saves and Susannah a wheelchair bound African-American with a multiple personality disorder. He recruits all three to become fellow gunslingers and help him achieve his goal to get to the Dark Tower and save all versions of humanity.<br /><br />The fourth book finds the quartet hired by the town  of Calla to prevent the Wolves from taking their children. The Women of Calla give birth to an unusual high number of twins. Evidently these Wolves who ride on horseback wearing armor abduct one of the pair. The abducted children are either never seen again or are returned mentally destroyed but grown into physical giants constantly in pain. Roland suspects there's more than meets the eye here and agrees despite the importance of reaching the Dark Tower to help the townsfolk. Father Callahan (a character from King's novel Salem's Lot)leads the townsfolk in approaching Roland to help them. With a battle before them Roland must prepare his gunslingers for dealing with these otherworldly creatures with the knowledge that somehow they figure into his mission.<br /><br />Although it's a bit long at 700 pages (it could easily have been trimmed down by about 200), WOC continues to develop the characters of The Gunslinger series. King's abilities as a novelist has continued to grow and he tackles this novel with skill that the author of Carrie or even Salem's Lot might not have been able to do. The book features a generous assortment of color illustrations throughout.<br /><br />Although the series continues on with Song of Susannah and the final volume The Dark Tower, this is where the series truly becomes more interesting and complex. If the last two books in the series don't quite live up to the expectations of the previous ones, it's because of the length and duration of the saga. The other flaw in King's book is the huge build up to the battle with the Wolves themselves.

Greenblatt's world relies as much on what is known about Shakespeare and the world that he lived in. Is it possible that a man without a university education and without serious political connections and wealth could have written the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare? Yes and to assume otherwise would be the same as assuming that Paris Hilton could become the greatest actress of our generation by virtue of the fact that she's wealthy and hangs out a crowd that includes talented artists. Just because you've got social advantages (or disadvantages)doesn't necessarily mean you'll change the world. Greenblatt indirectly creates a compelling argument for Shakespeare as the author of the plays under his name.Great art can appear out of anyone with the talent, desire and opportunity to present it. Greenblatt's biography shows through his cross connections and supposition just how Shakespeare might have evolved into the great playwrite that we, the audience, know and love. By looking at the world that shaped Shakespeare, Greenblatt proposes a world that shaped Shakespeare's writing and helped shape the theatrical world around him as well.<br /><br />Although Greenblatt bases a lot of his observations and conclusions on deduction and supposition, he makes a lot of intelligent and accurate observations about the world that shaped William Shakespeare. He also, in turn, speculates (sometimes hitting his target and sometimes not)how Shakespeare used the world that formed him to, in turn, form his great works. Are all the conclusions perfect and ironclad? Greenblatt also points to popular works in latin that Will loved so much that he incorporated some basic plot elements into his plays as well (not unlike the Greek playwrites of their era).<br /><br />Biographers, like historians, draw conclusions from evidence but those conclusions are informed by the bias of their time. That's also true of Greenblatt's work. Still, he makes some remarkable observations and his insights into Will's world will leave you thinking about the plays and sonnets in a whole new way. That's the value of a cultural and historical biography like this. While all the details of Shakespeare's life may be sketchy luckily for us his great plays (even though they've been through many hands and editors over the years) are not. They continue to resonate with great observations about human nature. Greenblatt's book will reshape some of your thinking about the man behind \\"The Tempest\\" and \\"Hamlet\\" and other times you'll find you completely disagree with him. That's the art of a great biography to create an atmosphere where discussion fuels the fire of interpretation.makes some remarkable observations and his insights into Will's world will leave you thinking about the plays and sonnets in a whole new way.

A brutal murder that's movitated simply by racism and committed by a Nazi skinhead in the United States, though, is quite another matter. In 1988 a Nazi skinhead by the name of Kenneth Mieske beat the head in of a Ethiopian immigrant by the name of Mulugeta Seraw over a minor disagreement that gets out of hand. Elinor Langer's fine book provides the background, the pathology if you like, of this disease that allows violence against people of other races to continue in our country.<br /><br />Langer begins with the murder and then traces the roots of the movement in Portland that gave rise to the neo-Nazi skinhead movement in her state. She also looks at the poverty, submerged anger, drug use and philosphy that feeds the anger that leads to events like this. In many respects, Langer's book (which began as a series of ongoing articles about the case) provides a glimpse into America's darker side. We discover how the movement began, how it spreads and how it takes root in communities outside her own as well.<br /><br />While it isn't necessarily the easiest book to read, it's compelling and thoughtful. It's not lite reading for the beach but it's the type of book for those interested in how society makes a wrong turn as it grows and matures. Her coverage of the trial, the evidence and the feelings of those involved gives a borad perspective into what fans the flames of monsterous acts in our world. A Hundred Little Hitlers frightens me worse than any Stephen King novel or the latest \\"Resident Evil\\" movie could because it's about the world around us.	2004-09-04
US	52569116	R38FSVV1P9XJ6B	0312878265	157089905	Duel	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Outstanding collection of terror and science fiction	\\"Duel\\" the title story of this terrific collection of terror, horror and science fiction stories, became the basis for Steven Spielberg's marvelous TV movie of the same name (by the way just released to DVD after a long, long delay by Universal). David Mann becomes involved in an increasingly dangerous game of cat and mouse with a truck driver. Their road rage leads to more and more dangerous confrontations until it's clear that the truck driver wants to kill Mann. A marvelous suspense story, \\"Duel\\" is the blueprint for Matheson's script to the movie of the same name.<br /><br />We also get \\"Little Girl Lost\\", \\"Death Ship\\", \\"Steel\\", \\"Third from the Sun\\" and \\"Born of Man & Woman\\"(all of which were adapted by Matheson and/or Rod Serling for the classic  \\"Night Gallery\\" and \\"Twilight Zone\\" series) with 12 other stories of terror and science fiction. Like Matheson's novels I Am Legend and The Incredible Shrinking Man, the author likes to mix equal elements of terror, science fiction and intelligent character studies in this collection of classic stories from the 50's (\\"Duel\\" is the lone story from the 70's).<br /><br />You may ask yourself what the difference is between horror and terror? Well Boris Karloff stated that terror is anticipating the monster behind the door while horror is actually seeing it in all its gruesome glory. The former creates considerably more suspense and anxiety while the latter is a shock to the system that doesn't last very long (like the murder scene in \\"Psycho\\" as compared to the scene where Cary Grant is being pursued by the crop duster in \\"North by Northwest\\"). It also can be reduced to semantics. Either way, this collection will provide interesting thrills and chills. Even if you've seen the films adapted from Matheson's work (or TV programs), you'll still enjoy Matheson's fluid writing style and pacing. There's more here than meet the eye and it's well worth investigating.	2004-09-04

This edition is for the Tor Edition which is a large format trade paperback that includes the novel The Shrinking Man under its film title The Incredible Shrinking Man with 9 other Matheson stories including \\"Duel\\" and \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\". This review applies ONLY to \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man\\" Tor Edition.<br /><br />A master of terror, science fiction and the mystery genre, Richard Matheson's work has inspired many classic (and not so classic films). Why? Because he's one of the best writers working in a genre that never quite good the respect it deserved. His best work inspired people like Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Dan Simmons and other current masters of terror. Matheson's The Shrinking Man (the original title by the way--the Incredible part of the novel from what I recall was added after the movie was made)begins simply enough; Scott Carey is out on a boat with his brother when the ship is enveloped by a fine mist that gently stings his skin. He wipes it off, goes down below to tell his brother Marty about it and thinks nothing of it again. Until he begins grow smaller each day. From this simple beginning we immediately jump to Carey fighting a spider in the basement of his house (although both novel and film begin the same way, after the introduction Matheson's novel veers in a slightly different direction telling us most of the story in flashback. A smart choice for the novel and it would have been a bold choice for the film but Universal-International veoted the idea).<br /><br />A marvelous novel that deals with the themes of sense of self, loss of control and, ultimately, loss of identity as Carey shrinks smaller and smaller, it's also a marvelous story of terror (with elements of science fiction thrown in as well). Finally back in print after a long slumber, The Incredible Shrinking Man is fleshed out with a number of stories (the novel is only about 200 pages)including \\"Duel\\" (the basis for Steven Spielberg's film of the same name), \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\"(the basis for the classic \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode featuring William Shatner and remade by director George Miller for \\"The Twilight Zone Movie\\"), and seven other short stories. A warning to readers is in order. \\"Duel\\" and \\"The Test\\" both appear in 2 other Matheson anthlogies published by TOR books but there's also a lot of other gems in the books Duel and Nightmare at 20,000 Feet as well.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book, I'd suggest Matheson's marvelous novel I Am Legend (which is, again, fleshed out by 10 Matheson short stories as the novel is fairly short. That novel was made into two films neither one of which captures the novel very well. \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and the horrendous \\"The Omega Man\\". It also provided the uncredited inspiration for George Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" trilogy). Matheson's hommage to Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, Hell House is also a good read (made into the movie \\"The Legend of Hell House\\" featuring Roddy McDowall).is only about 200 pages)including \\"Duel\\" (the basis for Steven Spielberg's film of the same name), \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\"(the basis for the classic \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode featuring William Shatner and remade by director George Miller for \\"The Twilight Zone Movie\\"), and seven other short stories.

US	52569116	RIY0BHV9UP9TJ	0312868855	396467465	Hell House	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Matheson's tribute to Jackson still has bite	\\"Hell House\\" isn't your typical gothic terror novel. Writer Richard Matheson's novel attempts to create a haunted house novel without the gothic trappings that have so dominated the genre. With a tip of the hat to Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, Matheson takes many of the same themes and gives us a more modern, updated version. It's a pretty daring move and not one that was done out of the need for money or laziness. Think about it--do tackle a type of story that had been done definintely by another talentd writer. The challenge must have kept Matheson up at night as he tried to figure out ways to spin a story just as riveting using the same basic plot device and yet make it uniquely his own.<br /><br />I have to disagree with other reviews here regarding Hell House; while it isn't Matheson's most accomplished novel (I Am Legend is a better written novel of terror as is his fantasy novel Bid Time Return which was made into the movie \\"Somewhere in Time\\")but it does exactly what it sets out to do--create a sense of foreboding and menace. Like Stephen King's The Shining (which actually is an inversion of the haunted house formula; it's about a haunted man triggered by a house filled with evil spirits), Hell House digs in deep into the characters and what ultimately drives them to seek out the house. These characters are as haunted in some respects as the main character in Jackson's novel and King's. Like all great haunted house novels, Hell House is about the changes the house triggers in these haunted, scared individuals not the evil spirits possessing the house itself.<br /><br />There are only 36 dramatic situations in the world. The Greeks created all 36 and every variation on these 36. We live in a time of mass media where great writing is devauled. Matheson's novel develops characters and puts them in a difficult situation where their own Ids are allowed to play and contributed to the mayhem of a house at once possessed and possessive of the people it \\"takes\\".<br /><br />Hell House becomes the vehicle to explording the dark side of these seemingly \\"normal\\" individuals. It's a credit to Matheson that the characters are so distinctive and yet he can still pay tribute to the genre, one of the best novels from the genre and still create a spooky experience. It may not be raw (like many of Clive Barker's well written novels) or nasty enough for some folks, but that's part of its charm as well. It's designed to instill terror not absolute horror. Terror is about anticipation horror is seeing the thing you anticipate. The former can instill greater, more powerful emotions because you haven't seen yet what might be stalking you and it's larger than your imagination. Just like Matheson's book.takes\\".  <br /> <br />Hell House becomes the vehicle to explording the dark side of these seemingly \\"normal\\" individuals.

US	52569116	RNKWVG7WD8SBB	0743262530	613538594	Vamped: A Novel	Books	4	19	19	N	N	Blood and satire	David Sosnowski's VAMPED takes a twisted view of the vampire novel. What if humanity were an endangered species on a world where everyone has been turned into vampires? What sort of world would the vampires make? Ironically enough, it's not all that different from ours. Marty one of the vampires that \\"flipped\\" the world by systematically recruiting more and more mortals into the world of the undead lives in a world where everyone works the graveyard shift. Strip clubs are still popular and the most popular drink is, well, blood on tap.<br /><br />One night a little mortal girl named Isuzu escapes from a farm where they breed humans illegally for the black market. She and her mother have been hiding out in the woods. Marty discovers Isuzu alone and scared. His world has turned into one of sweet ennui. He decides what he's really missing is the thrill of the hunt of the kill. But something changes his mind and instead of killing the little girl, he adopts her. Not an easy thing to do when your neighbors would want to rip out her little throat if they discovered her. Suddenly, Marty gets thrust into the world of parenthood and must deal with all the issues of a father...that and being undead.<br /><br />Well written with wit and more than a touch of satire and darkness, Sosnowski's novel takes the premise of Richard Matheson's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, twists it and turns it inside out combining it with a touch of Anne Rice and Stoker to create a well thought out comic look at our world as seen through the eyes of the undead. Sosnowski deals with a number of uncomfortable themes in the book once removed because it isn't our world at all but a parallel Earth where vampires rule the world and even have their own vamped pets.<br /><br />This novel isn't for everyone. Someone expecting INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE or DRACULA will be disappointed. If you're adventureous enough to try something new with a touch of dark comic wit, VAMPED may be for you. I wasn't all that pleased with the conclusion but it was the only logical way for the story to go. Still, I had hoped that Sosnowski might be able to pull off something a bit more radical at the conclusion. That small flaw aside, VAMPED entertains, provides a bit of thoughtful discussion and enough one liners to keep you chuckling. Overall, a very successful novel and quite fun to read as well. Now let's hope they don't turn this into a movie and screw it up for everyone or, if they do, that they get witty writer (Buck Henry or someone like him) and director (Guillermo Del Toro would do a fine job).ased with the conclusion but it was the only logical way for the story to go.

If you've seen either movie (\\"The Last Man on Earth\\" featuring Vincent Price and \\"The Omega Man\\" with Charleton Heston), you'll get a taste of the theme without the full flavor of this marvelous novel's full meal.<br /><br />A plague has been released on mankind. Everyone has turned into Vampires except for Robert Neville.In a very clever inversion of Dracula, the last remaining human becomes the monster in their eyes as all of humanity has changed except him.  He's not just an outsider but a crusading outsider --the Van Helsing of the book--bent on destroying these mutant creatures.<br /><br />Matheson's novel isn't just about horror but about character. His best work has always concentrated on the humanity of his characters and trying to create a convincing world where they just don't fit anymore (The Shrinking Man is another fine example of this theme). Skillfully written, I Am Legend doesn't feature blood splattering or gore at the turn of every page (this was written in the 50's folks) but concentrates on character, mood and suspense as it does on the horror that drives the story.<br /><br />I have to agree with Dean Koontz and Stephen King about Matheson--he set the standard for the modern horror story with his thoughtful, carefully plotted stories and glimpse into these isolated characters. Like fellow writers Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont and William F. Nolan, Matheson's stories turn as much on the creepiness of the situation and core idea as they do on the convincing characters he creates. He doesn't rely on cheap tricks nor on a bloody rampage to keep you turning the pages. If you're the type of person who always has to investigate a place where there's a prominent \\"Keep Out\\" sign (or did so as a kid)or did something precisely because the other kids wouldn't do it, you'll appreciate Matheson's complex character driven horror and science fiction stories. I'd also recommend A Stir of Echoes (adapted into the criminally underrated but quite different film of the same name).Stir of Echoes (adapted into the criminally underrated but quite different film of the same name).	2004-08-07
US	52569116	RE2E34MRXWF9T	0765307545	53158574	The Consciousness Plague	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A promising premise buried under pedestrian prose	I really wanted to like this book. Paul Levinson's novel promised great things: 1) it has an intriguing premise 2)I've liked mixed genres books before 3)The setting and science is interesting. Unfortunately, Levinson's book fails to take off the way I had hoped. The characters seem as if they've been pulled from mediocre mystery movies. The dialogue comes across as second rate Hammett or Chandler. The narrative too many coincidences. It seems ready made for a sale to Hollywood.<br /><br />The novel has some redeeming factors. Levinson has the core of a fascinating character in Phil D'Amato. His fascinating story idea needs more narrative development but comes across pretty well. The science seemed pretty valid if a bit far fetched. I haven't read any of Levinson's other novels or short stories so can't comment on how this compares to his other stuff but he does show promise as a writer.<br /><br />The major flaw with The Consciousness Plague is that it comes across as a treatment for a science fiction movie but one that might be a Sci-Fi original program with a limited budget and scope. Levinson's editor David Hartwell should have worked with the author at refashioning the novel and fleshing out the characters. It also would have helped to reduce the coincidences that crop up throughout the book and the easy narrative breadcrumbs that lead Levinson along the way to his conclusion.	2004-07-26

Jack Kirby, Joe Simon, Stan Lee, John Romita, Steve Ditko and other great comicbook writers/artists all contributed to this unique American artform. Ro's book provides a pretty comprehensive look at the forces that drove the industry and drove the men that changed the industry to shape the comicbook world we have today.<br />Ro's book, though, lacks an important part of the story--illustrations of the art form itself and pictures of those who played key roles in this ongoing story. Kirby's cover art gives a sense of his work but it doesn't provide context; we don't really know (except by Ro's description)what the early comicbooks looked like prior to Kirby's arrival. Some examples to contrast the change in storytelling over time might have been helpful as well. There are enough of these &quot;classic&quot; comic books that must be in the public domain by now so that he could have included them as examples for readers not as familiar with the changes these giants of the industry created.<br />Ro's book comes across as pretty accurate although there are a few minor errors and omissions that crop up. Still, with as large a canvas as he's working with, he's done a very good job of summing up what made the comic book world tick from the 30's through today. Comic books were America's attempt at creating a cultural context, in a sense its own mythology and legends that so many older cultures have. Their enduring popularity has as much to do with the snapshot they provide of life or what they reflect from the real world as their value as escapist entertainment.<br />This book on Kirby, Lee, Ditko and others really is much broader than a cultural history; it focuses on many of the movers and shakers that changed the industry. While it's Kirby's story, it's also, in a sense, about the rise of the American culture that has come to dominate much of the world. Although it might not be called definitive, it does give a sense of Kirby's (and others as well)contribution to an emerging American art form that was once derided for corrupting the morals of society.t be called definitive, it does give a sense of Kirby's (and others as well)contribution to an emerging American art form that was once derided for corrupting the morals of society.	2004-07-11

It's a nice companion to look up the various plots, credits, etc. if you're not all that familiar with them based on their episode  titles (and who could be with so many to choose from?)but it leaves quite a bit unsaid about the gestation of the show, etc.<br />While &quot;The Next Gen Companion&quot; never quite lived up to the depth and background provided in &quot;DS9 Companion&quot;, it did at least have more details on the series and trivia about the making of the various episodes. It seems with each succeeding volume associated with a Trek series, that we get less information. By the time the one for &quot;Enterprise&quot; is ready for release, we'll probably only get a brief synposis and no pictures.

He was three when he caught it and nearly lost his life. Instead, he lost the hearing in his left ear. It was just another moment in his past for him. He didn't attach any significance to it except for noting that his mother and father were scared to death that he wouldn't survive. He did. There were others who were less fortunate.<br />John Barry's well researched book acts as more than a glimpse into the past; it's a cautionary tale about the present as well. Barry notes that the great influenza was the first pandemic in modern history that seemed unstoppable; it killed more people in 24 hours than the black plaque killed during a century. It left lingering effects in the more of a parkinson's life disorder where brain cells of the substania nigra were destroyed due to the effects of the virus and fever. World War 1 wasn't won by armies but by the effect of the flu. The virus spread like wildfire throughout barracks and through regiments. It was the merchant of death and humanity was at its mercy.<br />The heroes in this war against nature were scientists. Oswald T. Avery, Anna Wessel Williams, William Park all were among the heroes who marched against this nasty virus. The results of their(and their compatriots)hard work is a world where humanity has a fighting chance against these nasty diseases.<br />The most telling story is quoted from the book THE PLAGUE OF THE SPANISH LADY. In it, the author recounts the tale of Charles Lewis in South Africa. He boarded a streetcar to take him home. In the course of the three mile journey the conductor died. Then the driver and 5 others died. All within a three mile stretch. That's how lethal this virus proved to be.<br />Barry also recounts the discovery of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) which leaves the lungs looking like forest after a massive fire. The airways are as bare and desolate looking as the moon.<br />Barry's book is both frightening and hopeful. We face the same challenge now as pathogens continue their massive assault around his. The problem has always existed we've only just begun to understand the threat. We take for granted that we live in a fragile, uncertain world. We've got the wits to recognize our enemy.

I wrote it for the same reason JMS wrote this novel--the entertainment I wanted to see hadn't been produced. &quot;Demon Night&quot;'s strengths include strong characters, well written prose and thoughtful observations. The plot manages to incorporate a lot of things we've seen before but in a new, fresh fashion. The pacing and prose make &quot;Demon Night&quot; an easy read. I will admit, though, that the pacing at the beginning was a bit of a challenge but the mystery about why and how the main characters room was demolished while he was asleep kept me focused on moving along to the next chapter.<br />This reprint by ibooks features a funny and entertaining new afterword by JMS in which he describes why he wrote the novel and how it came to be published. The style of the novel reminds me of Stephen King crossed with Dan Simmons, William F. Nolan and with a dash of Peter Straub thrown in. It's clear that he wrote the novel to entertain himself but also as a tribute of sorts to the contemporary horror novelist he enjoys reading.<br />&quot;Demon Night&quot; compares favorably with the best horror ficition written by Simmons, Straub and King and has a minor flaw that is characteristic of King's novels; with such a great set up and pay off, JMS doesn't quite know how to end the novel with the original band it deserves. That's o.k. as the point of the novel isn't the destination so much as the journey and sights we see along the way.	2004-02-28

These aliens were unknown to humanity until their watchdogs (or are they?) in the form of little silver orbs floating quietly above humanity.<br />This forms the fascinating and promising premise of Arthur Clarke and Stephen Baxter's Time's Eye which is subtitled A Time Odyssey. While only time (pardon the pun) will tell if this is as important or thought provoking as Clarke's other Odyssey novels, this makes for a fascinating start. Clarke has finally found another collaborator up to the task of working with him. The only other novelist that would have been capable and could flesh out Clarke's characters was the late Mike McQuay.<br />Baxter's a well known sf novelist and award winner in his own write (all these nasty puns just keep wanting to pop in for time). His novels Manifold: Time is an essential modern science fiction classic (and included in CD-ROM form with the book). The characters are pretty well developed (a problem for even Clarke's best novels)and the writing is about as sound from a science point of view as a tale like this could be. We'll have to wait for the other two novels in this series to be published before finding out what the real motives are behind the Firstborn.<br />With Clarke and Baxter's well developed idea along with the deft characterizations make Time's Eye an important sf book from two of the best writers around.	2004-02-13

This latest revision allows Wood to revisit his past and comment on both his acute observations on Hitchcock's films and comment some of the sillier concepts that dotted the original book as well. It's appropriate that Wood cites Freud as often as he does; Hitchcock was fascinated with psychoanalysis and it figures significantly in a number of films in one form or another. On the other hand, Wood also revisits many of the same films in the newer material and while the observations are always interesting, they are, at best just as overblown as some of his original inflated claims for Hitchcock as well.<br />Hitchcock's Films still stands as an essential read for Hitchcock fans and film students but much of what Wood has to say should be taken with a grain of salt. Wood frequently becomes so anayltical that he loses touch with the power and joy in Hitchcock's craft. Hitchcock's films are as much about his technique as they are about the themes that fascinated him. Hitchcock's Films isn't a bad book; it's a book that needs to be read by someone who has already developed enough critical skills to recognize when the author's arguements have become as full of hot air as a balloon.<br />Like all the hyperbole written about an important artistic figure, Wood's book has a number of noteable insights but, again, he reads more into the material than is there sometimes. I much prefer Patrick McGilligan's fine biography of Hitchcock. McGilligan manages to mix his observations with comments from people who actually were involved in the making of the films. We get insight from the artist's that collaborated with Hitchcock vs. second hand observations from someone sitting in a darkened cinema.	2004-01-26

What's sad about this heinous crime is that those involved in subjecting innocent men, women and children to these inhuman experiments went on to affluent positions in the pharmaceutical industry in Japan, political power and respect from their peers. They were essentially rewarded for the same horrible behavior that the Nazi's were arrested, tried and convicted for--treating captive humans as lab rats.<br /><br />Barenblatt documents the rise of nationalism in Japan and how the social stratification of its society gave rise to Unit 731 where much of this work was carried out. Many of the participants had a sense of superiority that made them believe other humans were somehow no better than animals. The main mover and shaker behind this horror was a doctor named Ishii who came from a privilaged background, married into power and cultivated social relationships to increase his power and climb the social ladder of Japan. His beliefs made him as dark and evil as Hitler and Gobbels.<br /><br />Under Ishii's direction Unit 731 would routinely spray toxins over parts of China, Taiwan and other captured countries. His men would also contaminate food with bacteria and deadly virues and hand them out to people. The worst part of this story was the treatment of children; they were frequently subjected to \\"innoculations\\" that consisted of a deadly cargo of bacteria and disease.<br /><br />War always has casualities. But Ishii's victimization of innocent babies, children, woman and men who were guilty of being inferior in his eyes, puts him in the save league as other monsters throughout history. These innocent victims didn't know what was happening and couldn't stand up for themselves. Until now, their voices were lost in the din of history. Barenblatt's book allows them to finally point out the monsters who did this to them.<br /><br />Why weren't these monsters punished? Some of these people were tried and executed in Russia after the war. What did the United States do? Nothing. When MacArthur liberated Japan, he struck a deal with the doctors of Unit 731 that allowed them to go unpunished and resume their respectful careers in society. This is a sad example of how ego, bigotry and ignorence can be rewarded. MacArthur and the United States participated in this horror by covering it up.<br /><br />Barenblatt should be applauded for giving a voice to those who couldn't cry out for themselves and for finally uncovering the identities of the cowards who committed these acts of evil against innocents.istory.

His focus, though, is on two of the most important movers and shakers in the independent world; Harvey and Bob Weinstein the founders and driving forces behind Miramax films and Robert Redford's Sundance Institute and film festival for independents. What makes Biskind's book unique is its inside information (frequently provided by people who are afraid of going on the record for fear of being black listed by the Weinsteins).<br />His portraits provide a harsh, naked glimpse at the greed and ego (terms used to describe Bob and Harvey Weinstein by one former exec)that drive these important creative/business forces. He also focuses on the passion and love of film that helps provide these individuals with peace of mind about how, who and why they do business the way they do. We also get glimpses of other creative forces that have emerged from into the spotlight; Tarantino is portrayed as brilliant, manipulative and as much a credit hog as Orson Welles was claimed to be early in his career<br />One telling moment that says it all about how money and fame change people--Tarantino's lawyer faxes screenwriter Roger Avery an addition to this contract. In the new contract Avery will be paid a substanial sum if he will forego his screenwriting credit on Pulp Fiction he will, in return, continue to make residuals on the film and be given a co-story credit. Why? Because Tarantino feels his film would look better if it concluded with a single credit &quot;Written and directed by Tarantino&quot; . Avery signs because he needs the money and because his own project Killing Zoe will sink without the additional income. What disturbs him is that Tarantino didn't lobby for this himself--he had an outside party do it even though they started together as clerks in the same video store and have known each other for years.<br />In another section a discussion focuses on how Redford's Sundance organization tried to squash another festival that would focus on first films directed by individuals without a deal. Some of these films were also rejected for competition in Sundance due to politics more than an estimation of creative worth. The competition wasn't healthy in their eyes; evidently more options and better films has been supplemented by the business of Sundance.<br />There's positives as well--the story focuses on how the Weinsteins and Redford helped refocus Hollywood away from producing cookie-cutter blockbuster fare as they did after the success of Star Wars and the formular driven movies that came in its wake. Success breeds imitation and sometimes that imitation debases and destroys the creative process.<br />Biskind is also quite honest about how Miramax attempted to distract and tempt him away from writing this book by dangling the carrot of a deal with their publishing division. He was tempted to take the deal but stuck to his guns.<br />This fascinating portrait demonstrates that Redford and the Weinsteins despite their faults helped to refocus American film away from the blockbuster schlock that dominated the industry for a long period of time. The positive effect is that films with meaning and that were cutting edge were, again, being given their due even if they were frequently compromised by those very people providing them with an outlet. Ultimately, it's always about balancing art and commerce. As Biskind points out, commerce usually wins but sometimes the art sneaks out for a night on the town.<br />This isn't a perfect book and while there's a lot of fair balance, Biskind is upfront about proving his thesis. There's lots of suspects in the mugging of American film and sometimes the very people doing the mugging are also solving the crime.on focuses on how Redford's Sundance organization tried to squash another festival that would focus on first films directed by individuals without a deal.

While the Lippincott's Nursing Drug Guide 2004 has lots of useful information and is a compact, informative source for most drugs, it's missing many new drugs approved and on the market as of 2002. For example, Pimecrolimus (tradename Elidel) which is widely used by derms, peds and family practice doctors is nowhere to be found in the book either under its generic or brand name.<br />Some similar medications with the same mode of action but different absorption and pharmacokinetics are lumped together For example, Concerta, Ritalin LA, Ritalin, Ritalin SR are all lumped together under their generic name without discussing the effects of the different delivery systems and how that might impact patient side effects.<br />There's absolutely no mention of oral terbinafine which has been on the market for the last three years. Since oral anti-fungals can have differing coverage and drug interactions, it would be wise to be comprehensive in this particular category.<br />On the other hand, many of the IV medications are pretty up-to-date making this more of an indepensible guide for hospitals vs. office based practices. Certainly there are medications that might be sampled/written on the office level here as well; it just appears as if the information isn't as comprehensive as could be.<br />The book is well organzied with an index based around the class of medication as well as generic names. For those medications that are &quot;branded&quot; it might be a bit more difficult to find as there is no brand name guide. Since not all of us think of medications and their generic names, this might be a useful cross reference (particularly if the patient knows the brand name and not the generic as so often happens).<br />There's a very useful section based on the different types of medications that provides a thumbnail overview of the class and the typical side effects and effects seen with the class of medication. There's also a useful section that has illustrations of some of the common medications out there. Since patients frequently remember the color and shape of their pills but not always other details about the medication (beyond what they take it for), this is useful as well in determining what the patient might be taking.<br />This book is certainly more user friendly and easier to access than the PDR and is missing the complete PI for various medications verbatium. In a sense, this is an advantage as the guide provides a good, quick and targeted overview on each medication. It also allows nurses to sidestep the useful information that the FDA frequently requires drug manufacturers to put in their package insert.<br />On the whole, Karch's book is very good and an indepensible tool for nurses. Karch's book also overlooks a number of popular medications that were approved as soon as two years ago and tends to lump the medications together without distinguishing the differences between delivery systems and how that might impact the side effects patients feel.a useful section that has illustrations of some of the common medications out there.

What's really outstanding about this biography is the new bits of information and the careful research. I read Donald Spoto's book on Hitchcock 15 years ago and, while I found it informative, I also found it focused on Hitch's character flaws at the expense of providing a well rounded view of the person. This National Enquirer approach to Hitchcock look much of the credibility away from Spoto's book in my mind.<br /><br />In contrast, there's more information and fair balanced analysis than in John Russell Taylor's offical biography. Like Taylor's book is, like Spoto's, well researched, this biography has the advantage of additional scholarship and sources willing to share new information and insights on Hitchcock.<br /><br />We get to see short stories that Hitch wrote when he was young, a number of interesting onset observations about the various films Hitchcock made and a shred analysis of Hitchcock's relationship between his leading men and ladies. In fact, I don't think any book has done such a great job of pointing out the reasons why Grant and Hitchcock broke off their collaborations in the 40's.<br /><br />Likewise, there are tidbits about both Rope and Strangers on a Train that I had never known (for example, Farley Granger who is one of the leads in both films was gay. That's not important except when you realize that Hitchcock cast against sexual orientation in Strangers having the straight Robert Walker play the homosexual killer and Granger the straight hero of the film).<br /><br />There's also a discussion about the casting decisions for various Hitchcock films, who he had in mind for various roles (some of which turned him down). For example, Grant was originally the actor that Hitchcock had in mind for \\"Rope\\" rather  than Jimmy Stewart. While Grant wanted to do Vertigo desperately and Hitchcock ultimately got his first choice, Jimmy Stewart.<br /><br />There's also quite a bit of information on the various films Hitchcock consulted on but never took credit for and a detailed analysis of the relationships between the best writers he worked with (John Michael Hayes, Ernest Lehman, Joseph Stefano, Ben Hect)and why their various working relationships splintered and fell apart.<br /><br />If you like this book on Hitchcock check out the author's other two biographies on two overlooked directors (both of whom Hitch admired)Friz Lang and George Cukor.t choice, Jimmy Stewart.<br /><br />There's also quite a bit of information on the various films Hitchcock consulted on but never took credit for and a detailed analysis of the relationships between the best writers he worked with (John Michael Hayes, Ernest Lehman, Joseph Stefano, Ben Hect)and why their various working relationships splintered and fell apart.<br /><br />If you like this book on Hitchcock check out the author's other two biographies on two overlooked directors (both of whom Hitch admired)Friz Lang and George Cukor.	2004-01-01

I profited just as much as the next person from the booming business in the 90's. I also was one of its victims. We all were and, as usual, there we're federal policies, greedy individuals and corporations and dishonesty that when mixed in with the prosperity helped undermine it. Certainly there are always periods of booms and busts--it's how we deal with aftermath and the excesses that matter.<br />Stiglitz's well written book examines the process of creation and the decay and corruption that can help undo these bursts of economic activity. Stiglitz doesn't point the finger at any one group of individuals more than another--he feels comfortable doling out the blame where it belongs and Washington is just as much a target as corporate America. Without the political stilts to support economic circus we all participate in, it would never happen. As a reflection on what's wrong (and occasionally right) with America's political and economic system, The Roaring Nineties is unstinting look at the harshness and ugliness underneath the system. It's also a book that argues for reform in a way to keep the economy moving without allowing criminal profiteering.	2003-12-29

Our perception is that just as these great advances creep out of the box, so do their equally nasty counterparts. Easterbrook's new book confronts the disconnect between prosperity and happiness with many statistics, observations and conclusions. The major flaw in Easterbrook's book is the reach for the easy answer or starry eyed optimism about our ability to completely solve problems. Pessimism exists for a reason just as optimism does; they balance each other out like some bizarre ying and yang helping to provide meaning in our brief lives.<br />On the whole, though Easterbrook's observations and comments are powerful and on the mark; we live in an age of enlightenment only to deny our ability to enjoy the outcome of progress. Easterbrook is most successful when taking a deep look at our inability to enjoy what we've worked so hard for but also his arguments for examining the pessisism and darkness that we've allowed to cloud our lives. While we live in a cynical world dotted with irony and sarcasm, we've allowed these very qualities which are useful in measured degrees to infect every aspect of our lives. While it may be fashionable to be all of these things to a large degree, it's also eroded our perception on the quality of our life. We no longer believe that good things happen to us without a price. We no longer believe that there's actually goodness in the world that can keep our darker nature at bay. These beliefs are essential for providing some sense of balance. If we believe the sky is always falling, then the vitality of our everyday lives is stolen from us.<br />In effect, we've allowed the darkness to suck all the fun out of our lives. While some of us feel worse about the quality of life for many valid reasons (for example, mutlitasking hasn't improved the quality of work just the load that we can do), we've also dismissed the improvements we have compared to our ancestors. To give Easterbrook credit he doesn't shy away from the fact that we've yet to solve poverty, malnutrition or unemployement. He also acknowledges that disease continues to slip through our fingers just as we think we've got a solid grip on it.<br /> Easterbrook's book isn't always convincing--he sometimes goes for the easy answer when there may be no answer at all--but it does make compelling and thought provoking reading. Perhaps next time he can examine the state of humanity without getting lost in the statistics that rule and help undermine our sense of the quality of life. It would also be useful if he looked at what's causing the  nihilistic hypochondria that's sweeping this nation. In many ways, we face challenges that are equally as daunting as those our great-grandparent's faced. While we may have antibiotics, science and nutrition on our side, we also have media that allows instant communication (like this forum)that can decimenate as readily as any virus or bacteria that killed our ancestors. We're overwhelmed with information which can be just as emotionally daunting as some of the issues that faced those before us.

There's been so much speculation about Kennedy's assassination that, despite compelling and strong evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald (In Case Closed) did it alone, the subject has taken on a literary and profitable life of its own. The same could be true for Jack the Ripper. More time has passed and, as a result, the evidence continues to become more and more distant from the present. I was dubious about the conclusions of Patricia Cornwell's book--how could a one mystery writer tackle and solve such a difficult case?<br />While much of the evidence is circumstanial (outside of the DNA evidence), Cornwell convinced me that she may have solved some of the Ripper murders. I'm not someone that has had a fascination with these type of things, but her observations (both physical and psychological), evidence and conclusions are pretty daunting. Walter Sickert was a well known artist of the time. He demonstrated qualities similar to what is suspected about Jack the Ripper and had a physical infirmery that could have led him down the path of murder and mutilation. Cornwell looks at Sickert's background, art, his writing, where he lived and many other elements and comes to the conclusion that he was, indeed, saucy Jack.<br />Is it possible? Very. One point, though, is that copycat mutiliations, murders and letter writing (along with time) has obscured much of the evidence. It's possible that there was more than one murderer. It's also possible that Sickert may have written some of the letters attributed to Jack without actually being Jack. There's no way to know for certain. Regardless, Cornwell makes a strong case for Sickert as Jack. The type of concrete evidence we're accustomed to in our day and age wasn't available then and there.<br /> There's also been so much misinformation over time that it's getting very sticky to separate fact from fiction so 100% certainty may continue to elude us as to what face the Ripper wore. Either way, Cornwell's well researched book is thought provoking. You may disagree with her conclusions but until you're able to come up with first hand evidence and observations about the case, it'll be mere idle speculation. Her speculation isn't idle--it's on target most of the time.ght provoking.

What's interesting about Gaiman's massive book are all the influences he sites and thanks at the end; Harlan Ellison, Terry Prachett and many, many others. Those influences are telling in American Gods. You can just about see the influences leaking through the cracks including Ellison's Deathbird story cycle. What it most reminds me of, though, is a cross of Stephen King's The Stand and his Gunslinger series. Gaiman still manages to create a work that is uniquely his own despite the melding influences evident in his work.<br />American Gods focuses on an interesting premise; when people stop believing in gods do they die or just retire? Gaiman's novel posits a conflict between the gods of old (Odin a number of mythological gods from Celtic culture and many, many others)and the gods modern America has created; the gods of the media and technology battle the gods of older, forgotten cultures. Caught in the middle of this is a cypher of a character named Shadow. Just released from prison for an assault, he's looking forward to seeing his wife and resuming his old job at a work out facility. Suddenly, he's faced with no past or future; his wife is killed in an accident and the job prospect dries up.<br />He's recruited by a character he meets on an airplane (&quot;call me Wednesday&quot;). Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow himself. Although he isn't interested at first, the job and character intrigue him. He takes it and suddenly finds himself thrust into a weird world of gods who have become con artists to survive and a pawn in a battle between the forces of what was and what is.<br />Gaiman's style throughout most of the novel reminds me of Stephen King. That isn't necessarily bad; Gaiman's strength is in his use of metaphors and similes. It's in his ability to tell a story with a convoluted narrative without the reader losing track of the point of origin and the point of destination. Again, the similarities are more to Ellison and King than any of his other contemporaries.<br />What American Gods lacks, though, is strong character development. Shadow is merely a cypher for much of the story. Yes, we know things about him but he's more important for what he represents (a character for the reader to identify with as the narrative becomes stranger) than what he is. In King's finest work his ability to distill and create memorable characters can outshine some of the silly plots. While Gaiman is still finding his way with creating complex characters that function within the tapestry of the narrative, it doesn't detract from the strong metaphorical stories he creates.<br />I wouldn't say that Gaiman has arrived as a novelist yet. He shows considerable promise. While there's still some debate as to whether American Gods deserved the Hugo Award for best novel, I can't think of a better structured, dense and entertaining narrative for the year it was nominated. I'm looking forward to Gaiman's further novels. Hopefully he can mature into the writer his work promises he'll become. From all indications, I'd say that it's a safe bet he'll be writing entertaining, interesting stories for some time to come.point of destination.

While McGilligan makes his own observations about Hitch's private life and how it intersected with his art.  With access to numerous sources, McGilligan's book focuses on Hitch's life, its impact on his art but without resorting to cheap psychological analysis as a means to \\"explain\\" it.    What's surprising is that McGilligan manages to come up with a number of fresh observations (and a fair amount of recycled ones as well)about Hitch's impact on cinema, the importance of his films and his artistry. McGilligan isn't afraid to point out Hitch's own character flaws. He also focuses as much on Hitchcock's innovations as a film director as well as the peers that Hitch borrowed from in his quest to make \\"pure cinema\\".    Packed with marvelously pictures (on slick photo paper no less)and observations by Hitch's many collaborators, A Life in Darkness and Light manages to be fair balanced without resorting sensationalistic shocks. For those looking for skeletons in Hitch's closet, you'll be disappointed for the most part. If you're looking for key observations and a better understanding of one of the most influential film director's from Hollywood's Golden Age of cinema, you'll be pleasantly surprised and entertained.    A Life in Darkness and Light manages to be both biography and appreciation and while walking that fine line means it's not a perfect book, it does provide readers with keen insights into the man, the importance his wife Alma played as a collaborator and his art. I'd recommend Light for both long time Hitchcock fans and those coming to Hitch's art for the first time.	2003-10-18

Michael Barrier's exhaustively researched book covers the Golden Age of Hollywood animation and the movers and shakers that had an impact on the art form.<br />At nearly 650 pages Barrier's book takes a fair balanced look at Disney, Warner Bros., Fleischer and other contributors to this dying art form. It's actually a perfect companion piece to the newely released boxed set of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes classics. Barrier avoids the Disney worship that marred other books of this type and, like Maltin's marvelous but less indepth book, he manages to point out the key contributions of the most important animation directors/producers of the era.<br />While it does overlook or give only a cursory overview of some important figures in the industry, Barrier's scholarly aproach manages to recognize the merits and flaws of each studio, their system and directors. Although not as well illustrated as Maltin's book, the pictures do provide a glimpse of many of the essential classics that impacted the art of animation. Since much of the documentation for the creation of some of the early Warner classics are long gone, Barrier has to rely on many of the same sources and pictures as other authors. The book could have been improved if he had gone more to private collectors for rare animation cels, production photos, model drawings and notes. I also would have liked many of these illustrations to be reproduced in color. Seeing them in dark black and white illustrations does little justice to the artistry of these pioneers.<br />Maltin's book was clearly the work of an informed fan; his approach focused on the creation of many of the important classics but didn't lose track of the fun in the finished product. Barrier's scholarly approach is a bit drier and doesn't quite communicate the excited of Maltin's less authoriative book on the same subject. It's still an important look at the pioneers of animation's Golden Age and, as such, should be read by those who love the shorts from the various eras examined here.esn't quite communicate the excited of Maltin's less authoriative book on the same subject.

Every book I've looked at after argues for Barrett's Floyd, Waters' Floyd or Gilmour's Floyd vs. taking a fair look at the accomplishments of all versions of the band. It's a pity that no journalist has chosen to update the late Nick Schaffner's book. It doesn't cover the very last album made under Gilmour's lead (which, despite much critical bashing, I feel is among their best).<br />Schaffner had access to both insiders and many rare sources when he put this book together in the late 80's (it was published after his death in 1991). His knowledge as a musician also helps give a fairness to the best and worst of Floyd. I was particularly interested in the section that discusses the recording of Barrett's post Floyd solo albums and Wright, Gilmour and Waters' involvement in helping out their own, fragmented friend.<br />There's also a selected discography that includes the results of The Amazing Pudding's '89 Readers Poll of Best and Worst FLoyd albums. The for (pardon the pun)record:<br />Best- Wish You Were Here, Dark Side, The Wall, Animals, Piper at the Gates. The Worst- The FInal Cut.  Bestselling (at the time of the book's publication)-Dark Side, The Wall, Wish, Animals and Momentary Lapse. Best Floyd songs-Comfortably Numb, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Echoes, Wish You Were Here, Time. Worst: The Dogs of War.<br />Worth picking up although, again, it obviously lacks any information after 1991. I'd rank Secrets as one of the best books written on the band.	2003-10-05

The hunches are just that and the evidence is circumstanial at best. I understand that Menzies believes that most of his potential &quot;proof&quot; was destroyed ages ago by the Chinese themselves. That doesn't prove his theory.<br /> In the most ridiculous accumulation of circumstanial evidence this side of Chariots of the Gods (Van Dankien's absurd premise at the heart of God is as follows;how could humans have built the pyramids--we're just not smart enough! Yet we came up with physics, mathematics, art, literature. All of that must of come from aliens from outer space as well), Menzies claims that the Chinese sailed virtually around the world. I have no doubt that the Chinese played more of a cultural role than previously attributed and believe that Menzies theory is fascinating but he lacks proof. Like Edward Hooper's book on the AIDS epidemic The River, Menzies began with his theory first and then sought out proof afterwards. That's not to say that Menzies' ideas don't have merit or that they don't merit serious discussion (or a more detailed book for that matter). Menzies proof is sketchy at best. Sure there is compelling evidence that suggests that the Chinese ventured far outside the waters of their continent but that doesn't prove that they discover the Americas or that Columbus knew about the Americas prior to sailing himself.<br />Many of Menzies ideas certainly would merit a more critical and objective book. 1421 isn't bad but it's an example of the National Enquirer world we live in; suggest a theory and then use sketchy information to support it. After all, most folks will never know and those less informed than Menzies will never suspect when his proof has been slanted to prove his theories. As it is, 1421 is no better than a fictional historical novel; while there are many bits of truth in it, there's also a whole lot of fiction.	2003-10-04

While Teresi doesn't prove all his claims, he does make a strong argument for a world where modern science, mathematics and physics had many fathers. The idea that all of this suddeny flowed from the Greek's without any other contributing factors has always been a hard to swallow for me. Science is in the details and the accumulation of evidence.<br />There's no doubt that many cultures both extinct and still thriving contributed to our understanding of the world. Teresi stretches it a bit though by comparing a creation myth to the theory of The Big Bang. Still, the accumulation of evidence and detail is here and, while I think he occasionally gets derailed by political correctness, but he's on target much of the time.<br />His difficulty is that so much time has passed and there's too little detail for much more ancient claims to be substaniated from the evidence at hand. Still, Teresi's points are well taken and many are quite valid; his point about Copernicus using Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi's mathematical theorem to help construct the Copernican system sounds valid based on the evidence at hand.<br />Lost Discoveries isn't a perfect book. Like the best science Teresi uses other scholars and evidence to built his own theory about the roots of modern science. He's too dependent on other researchers and makes a lot of assumptions about their conclusions. He also collates many interesting and obscure facts about other scientists outside of the western world to build his case. The only problem is that we have to assume he's being objective about the facts when, like every journalist, he's subjectively structuring his book to prove his various theories.<br />Teresi makes a number of very interesting and valid observations. Let's hope that someone else takes up Teresi's lead and can provide more compelling evidence on some of his weaker claims.on some of his weaker claims.	2003-10-04

US	52569116	RLNJSEEYHVIZ7	076530158X	365011657	Dune: The Machine Crusade	Books	3	33	42	N	N	Well thought out and plotted sequel to series 3 1/2 stars	First, let's get the obvious out of the way; Dune: The Machine Crusade is another prequel to Dune and a sequel to The Butlerian Jihad. It has all the drawbacks and bonuses of a sequel; if you haven't read the first in this series of prequels devised by Frank Herbert's son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson, you may feel a little lost at first. The good news is that Herbert and Anderson manage to fill in the blanks early on with a nicely written recap in the prologue (much as the Frank Herbert did with each sequel to his classic Dune novel).<br />I imagine that Herbert does much of the plotting based on Frank's original background notes and that Anderson does more of the hands on writing. At least it seems that way. In terms of style The Machine Crusades reminds me more of Anderson's novels than Brian Herbert's novels. But both had complimentary, similar styles so it's possible they rewrite each other.<br /> Either way, the plot continues. With the destruction of the Omnius on one of the settled worlds, humanity managed to strike a blow against the computer that created hope. The Cymeks led by Agamemnon struggle to regain their lost power against Omnius all the while fighting humanity as well. Time doesn't matter to Omnius or the Cymeks but it does to Serena Butler. Nearly a quarter century has passed since the computer's henchrobot murdered her son as part of an &quot;experiment&quot; to discover humanity's emotional movitation to fight even when they are clearly defeated. She and the others struggle on in battle against Omnius.<br />Agamemnon's son Vorian Atriedes and Xavier Harkonnen continue their uneasy alliance in fighting Omnius. We also get our first glimpse of humanity's discover of &quot;folding&quot; space and the impact it will have. On Arrakis the Fremen come into their own as fierce fighters led by Selim Wormrider. We begin to understand how this distant, remote and poor dust speck in the cosmos comes to occupy center stage in Frank Herbert's original novel.<br />This sprawling epic sets the stage for what's to come later in Herbert's original trilogy. Although it's uneven and the plotting is a bit more awkward here than in the some of the previous novels in this series, The Machine Crusade accomplishes most of its goal. It also sets up another potential sequel. To give Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson credit, the series they've created does credit to the original novel and Frank Herbert's memory. There are a number of interesting philosphical questions examined here. To the author's credit, they don't let the philosphical questions bog down the action. Both attributes contributes to the strengths and the flaws of the novel; the questions linger on too long and the battles are drawn out a bit too much. At times it seems as if the authors are struggling with the epic tale they are trying to tell; it's as if they are trying to come to grips with the size of the story they need to tell and control it. Even when it veers out of control, The Machine Crusade is still better than most of what passes for science fiction today.<br />Nevertheless, like its immediate predecessor, The Machine Crusade has an epic, vast scale that the story and characters deserve. It's clear that Brian Herbert in continuing on his father's story chose to do so in a fashion that wouldn't just cash in on (and hence dilute)the original novels. Instead, he and co-author Anderson have tried to come up with a series of space operas as rich in character and scope as the original series. While the dialog can be frequently clunky and the characterizations a bit too sketchy for some, these are minor flaws on this large canvas. They boldly move forward using all the colors of language that they can to describe this epic tale. If words occasionally fail them, it's because the story, like much of Herbert's original epic, can be overwhelming in its vast embrace of science, religion and politics.<br />If Brian Herbert and Anderson can continue to create novels thiscomplex, the Dune series has a future as more than a cookie cutter space opera series. If they occasionally borrow from some of the sf films that have come out since Frank wrote the original novel, it's only fair; George Lucas and many other film directors borrowed liberally for Frank's imagination, integrating into their own projects and calling it their own.his complex, the Dune series has a future as more than a cookie cutter space opera series.

Kress' novel would be little better than an average Michael Crichton thriller if not for her unusual twist; the genetic manipulation being done here is not by humanity but by an alien race called the Pribir.<br />The Pribir were once like humanity (or so they say)and are preparing humanity for life in an environment full of environmental toxics. Their primary means of communication appears to be through a series of complex smells. The resulting children from their experiment are something more than human but still have the same emotional flaws as their peers.<br />Kress deals with a lot of complex issues here: the environment and our place in it; the rights of those who have been genetically manipulated; the role of any outside culture in influencing another one--even for their own good. As usual Kress handles the plot, characters and themes deftly. What the novel lacks is any sense that it is building to a powerful conclusion.<br />Nothing Human isn't disappointing just anti-climatic. It's rare that a Kress novel disappoints and no one can write a classic every time. Kress' latest novel has much to admire but it just isn't in the same league as Beggar's in Spain or Probability Moon.	2003-09-11

He's a master of both forms but there's something distinctive about his shorter works. Perhaps it's because there are so few masters of the form. Harlan Ellison, Ray Bradbury and Nancy Kress are some of the dozen or so authors that are worthwhile (besides Simmons)investigating that are masters of the form. Two stories of note for fans who have read Simmons' novels.<br />Orphans of the Helix takes place in the Hyperion Universe but without any of the characters from any of the novels. It's a well written story that might have ended up on Star Trek Voyager if not for the ignorance of one of the show's producers.<br />The Ninth of Av relates to Illum (Simmons' latest novel). It's a prequel involving one of the characters from the novel and takes place prior to the disappearence of most of humanity.<br />All the stories are interesting particularly the mysterious Looking for Kelly Dahl. This marvelous story (which opens the book) concerns a character who has lost the will for living. He rediscovers it when he becomes involved in a variation on The Most Dangerous Game.<br />Worlds is well worth picking up. I know there are a number of readers who don't care for short stories (it seems to be a dying art form with less and less magazines publishing them). Worlds will be just as rewarding and more varied than most novels and is comparable in quality to Simmons' fine novels. I'd highly recommend it.	2003-08-30

The second book in Farmer's imaginative Riverworld series is better written although the plotting can occasionally still be a bit haphazard. Like To Your Scattered Bodies Go, Riverboat was originally serialized prior to publication. Despite some rewriting by Farmer, the second novel's pacing is inconsistent. The characters, like the first novel, are interesting and imaginatively portrayed. A fair warning, however, since most of these characters are from the 19 or early 20th Centuries, they aren't the most enlightened males. There's a hint of misogny and sexism at the core of many of these characters. I don't believe that reflects Farmer's point of view. Instead, it reflects the attitude and era of the male characters. What compounds this minor flaw, though, is the fact that Farmer couldn't convincingly write a strong female character(a problem that dogged the first novel). Here he primarily sticks to the male characters and the novel benefits from it.<br />Sam Clemens (aka Mark Twain), like Richard Burton, is intent on discovering the source of the great river and identifying the people who resurrected humanity. His companions include Joe Miller a brutish prehuman giant who, surprisingly, shows more humanity than most of Clemens' friends; World War 1 flying ace Von Richthofen who provides a sense of balance to Clemens' dark view of humanity and Erik Bloodaxe a harsh and cruel viking that is has Clemens as a member of his crew chiefly because Clemens claims to know a source for iron.<br />Clemens goal is to build a marvelous riverboat that will help him achieve his goal of discovering the motives of X the mysterious stranger who appears out of nowhere to help him (just as he did Burton) in his quest and why they've all been returned to life.<br />A couple of points--1) Keep in mind that this was written in the late 60's and published as a novel in 1971. It's of its era but the writing and themes have aged surprisingly well. 2) Although it wasn't designed with adolescent males in mind necessarily, that was the primary audience for the original piece. The attitudes and writing style occasionally demonstrates these elements.<br />Regardless, this is a fun series and still highly regarded for a number of good reasons. Farmer's novels and his ability with female characters would improve with later installments. By the time of the third volume The Dark Design, most of the flaws that dogged the first two installments had been overcome. The Riverworld series is still a well written series. While the series lost much of its power by the fifth and final book, there were still enough ideas floating around in one book that a lesser novelist would have made into 10 or 20 novels. In the series driven novels that have overtaken the science fiction genre, Farmer's novels, like Frank Herbert's, were written out of a love for the material not out of commerce. This attitude prevails even in the lesser books of this interesting and engaging series.<br />My only complaint with the latest editions are no comments or observations by Farmer 30 years after their initial publication. When these were first published (in 1998) Farmer was still going strong and working on a number of new novels and projects. On a side note it's a pity that the Science Fiction Channel ruined the first adaption of Farmer's novels. Riverworld was a mess where Burton was replaced by a 21st Century astronaut (obviously those teenagers wouldn't be able to relate to someone as obscure as Sir Richard Francis Burton!).

It's really rather sad because she's probably one of the best contemporary novelist and short story writers around. Her novel Brother Termite managed to subvert a genre that had become little better than cliche. In the process she also managed to satirize politics, our view of aliens and our obssessive/compulsive media.<br />Essentially, isn't quite what he seems and neither is this richly plotted mystery sf novel. I'm not going to recap the plot here as it's been done quite well in the amazon.com review but suffice to say that Anthony, like Phil Dick, takes science fiction (and other genre)conventions and likes to turn them inside out/upside down. Then she procedes to wrap a characters around the skeleton of the plot and finally top it off by wrapping her novels (and short stories)in a narrative skin that keeps your attention regardless of the length of the story.<br />I'd also recommend Anthony's Flaunders.

Everybody stumbles. We sometimes race along at such a pace that we don't pay attention to the cracks in the sidewalk or the uneven pavement.

Film, theater, television and, yes, novels all age just as we do. They (like their author)are products of their time. I haven't read this book since the mid-70's and decided to revisit based on some of the reviews here to see if it was all that bad.<br /><br />Guess what, it's still a pretty terrific book. Science fiction ages a bit less well than most mainstream or contemporary lit. Why? Because you're imagining the future--science fiction is like gambling you know the odds, you know that you could lose or be wrong, yet you do it anyway. Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong. Really, predicting the future isn't the point but observing human behavior because science fiction--the best science fiction--isn't just about doo hickeys and gadets. It's about human behavior.<br /><br />If Phil Farmer's Rvierworld books are a bit dated, it's because the author wrote the first installment (before it was a novel) in 1966. The only thing that's kept the novel interesting is 1)Farmer's fascinating concept and 2) The general quality of the writing. Sure, it's not the generic formularic writing we've come to expect--it's actually got something missing from much modern writing--character.<br /><br />That said, the concept and execution are terrific. Sir Richard Francis Burton author of The Arabian Nights and well known explorer is our hero. He dies on the first page. He awakens to what he believes is the afterlife where he sees millions of other bodies suspended in what appears to be hibernation. The next thing he knows he's been resurrected with all of humanity (and one alien creature)along the banks of a great river.<br /><br />His journey is dictated by his exploring nature; he plans to get to the mouth of the river and discover who has resurrected humanity and why. The journey allows him to encounter many historical figures and some ordinary folks as well (including a well disguised Phil Farmer).<br /><br />While the series went on a bit too long (Farmer clearly relished the concept and the challenges it presented), the first three books are like a ride down white rapids and just as fun. Their also full of interesting ideas, characters and strong narratives. The last two books in the series drag out a bit but are still worth searching out to provide closure for the series. I'm usually not much of a fan of series books--it's usually a case of the author having one great idea and dragging it on as long as possible.

The first and most important concerns the Trojan war. The catch here is that there are civilian observers all from the 20th and 21st century. They're to report what happens word for word during the most important conflicts and compare it to what Homer wrote. If they're not careful, these resurrected scholics will be torn apart by their masters. Who are their masters you ask? Why the Greek Gods with a capital G. They're alive and quite real and not just part of Greek culture's imagination.<br />In other interesting developments the entire population of normal humans with the exception of a few selected individuals, have vanished. They can't read or write but live a lazy life with no ambitions. They're served by the Voynix and various mechanical servers. Life is perfect unless you venture too far out from the estates where you can be picked off by a T-Rex or other recreated life form. Where did all of humanity go? Are they occupying the orbiting rings with the posthumans? Why did they leave?<br />In the third part of the story cyborgs bred for various tasks by long vanished humanity have discovered wormholes opening all over Mars. Mars isn't the red planet anymore. It's been terraformed and has life on it. It's not human life. An expedition is sent out to discover who is responsible and to put a stop to them wormholes before they corrupt the space time continumm.<br />All three distinct separate stories that share a central theme. All of them tied into the fate of Illum (or Troy)during the Trojan war.<br />Simmons manages to create a rich tapestry that actually cites Proust, Shakesphere, Homer and Virgil. He also manages to do so without becoming pretentious or preachy and weaves these literary references into a science fiction tale that promises to be as epic as his classic Hyperion novels. I say promises because this is the first book in a series of novels. Unlike most novelist, Simmons rarely milks a series for all it is worth. He creates a story and once it is resolved, he moves on to create something else. This approach leaves Simmons novels all the richer. While It certainly would behoove Simmons to create more novels linked directly to his Hyperion books (or the Night triology), he recognizes that once the story is told well and complete, it's time to move on. In this case, Simmons has moved on to create a number of stunning (and occasionally average) novels in a variety of genres. Illum promises to be comparable to the Hyperion novels in terms of scope, characters and themes.<br />Where have all the normal humans gone? How did the Greek gods become &quot;real&quot;? What are the voynix and why are they trying to keep the remainder of humanity docile? All of these questions will most probably be answered in Simmons' next book (set to be published sometime next year according to Locus). I'm hoping the conclusion will be as strong as the set up. Knowing Simmons and his track history (with the Hyperion books among many others), I don't doubt that he'll create a rip-roaring conclusion worthy of his concepts.<br />Why not five stars if this novel is so darn great? It's because it's a story only partially told. Illum ties up a number of loose threads but there's a second and third novel just waiting to be written (or perhaps like Hyperion he's already written them)to complete the story. Just because the complete story isn't told doesn't mean you shouldn't purchase and read this rich novel. It deserves to be read now. The second and third acts are in the wings. Consider the time between this and the second novel to be a brief intermission. It'll give you time to catch up or re-read some of Simmons other dazzling novels. There's a reason that Simmons has won the Hugo, Bram Stoker and Mystery Writers of America awards. He's that good. I can only think of a handful of writers that compare to him in any genre.

He also managed to alienate just about anyone that cared for him without any insight into his immoral and reckless behavior.<br />Luckily, the same insight that allows him to inhabit the characters of his often heartbreaking songs, eventually allowed him to see himself for what he was; a junkie wielding his needle like a bulldozer and rolling everyone and everything he cared about. He still disagrees with some of his former associates, lovers, wives (he's been married 4 times and had two children out of wedlock)but he's just as apt to turn that critical eye on himself and attack his own behavior in the past.<br />He's still an amazing writer and performer. Unlike his mentor Townes Van Zant, Earle managed to recapture his life before his self destructive behavior took too much of a physical toll (the best quote from Earle--\\"If I thought I'd live this long I would have taken better care of myself\\" applies to him as much as to Van Zant). He just managed to finally capture the demons driving him, bottle them up and put them on the shelf for display in his songs. They'll always threaten to break out but at least he has a place to put them where they'll do less harm to him and others.<br />He could be (and sometime still is) an awful person to those he loves. Fortunately, he recognizes the addictive behavior that drove him for so long and drove those around him away. Hardcore Troubador is a harrowing but irrestible read--just like the very drugs that almost destroyed Earle.could be (and sometime still is) an awful person to those he loves.

The DS9 companion is filled with interesting trivia, plot synposis of every single episode and a lot of great illustrations. There are some drawbacks, however, to this very good book. The background material stays (not surprising give it's an offical companion)polite.<br />The drawbacks to the book aren't surprising given the fact that it's an \\"offical\\" companion to the series. There's a surprising amount of facile critical commentary about various episodes. While I wasn't expecting an indepth analysis, I was expecting a bit more observation as to why certain episodes worked and others didn't. It would have been much more interesting to have individual cast members comment indepth about each individual episode. There is an attempt to do that but it's too little.<br />The paper is surprisingly thin with some photos and text poorly reproduced. Perhaps this has to do with the quality of the printing or the paper, I'm not really sure which. It also wouldn't have hurt to occasionally use color photos. What's great about the book, though, is how complete it is in covering everything from the acting to the post production effects. The information provided does outweigh the disadvantages of the printing and binding.<br />Don't get me wrong, the DS9 Companion is much appreciated. I found the series to be the most compelling of the Trek show produced. It's nice to have this around as I have a hard time remembering which episode showcased a particular actor or had this or that plot. The symposis of the episodes provide enough meat so that those who might have missed easly episodes can jump right in as well. It easily rivaled Babylon 5 for complexity of plot, conflict and an examination of both spiritual and politics never seen in a Trek series before or since.<br /> DS9 had the advantage of the Trek universe as a background but, really, it could have just as easily been outside Trek and been as successful in terms of the quality of the program.	2003-04-16

I wondered why they and Apple would  repackage The Beatles classics (along with some solo songs as well) in such a cheap way during the 70's. The collection featured 60 songs and I ordered it. It's no surprise to find out that Bruce Spizer's excellent book mentions this collection even though it was not authorized or put out by Apple.<br /><br />If you want the background on this and other Apple releases as well as see various label variations, packaging, etc. this is the definitive book to jump in and enjoy stepping back into history.<br /><br />I used to be a collector. That was before children, a mortgage and life changed things. Unfortunately, a lot of what I had was destroyed or lost over time with moving, etc. Which is why Bruce Spizer's account of Apple Records is so fun. It's like having every single conceivable Beatles Apple release available. He discusses the making, mastering and marketing of various Beatles albums and releases in the US.<br />Bruce has done a terrific job with this sequel to his three previous volumes on The Beatles (The Beatles On Vee Jay, The Beatles Singles and The Beatles Story on Capitol Records). This book is packed with sharp observations about the band, Apple and their releases and all with glorious color illustrations on high quality paper. I had always wondered, for example, why the album Hey Jude (aka The Beatles Again) was created and by whom. Bruce digs out the information as to the who, what where and whys.<br /><br />My only disappointment is the lack of information on the CD reissues by EMI & Capitol during the 80's through today. While I got sucked into the CD vaccum (like many people)I do enjoy the convenience of the smaller format for the car. Yes, the artwork leaves much to be desired but it has it's uses. I understand that there's less artwork and variation involved in the manufacturing of CDs (perhaps). I'm sure Bruce might address these in the future (along with the eventual release of The Beatles' catalog on either Blu-ray or SACD).<br /><br />As it stands, Bruce has done a great job and the book is exacting and well researched (as usual). I'm hoping someone can talk him into doing a book on the other releases for Apple (The Beatles solo albums and all the artist's they signed). Although this book appears quite pricey, the quality of the paper, binding and the material make it well worth the cost.release of The Beatles' catalog on either Blu-ray or SACD).<br /><br />As it stands, Bruce has done a great job and the book is exacting and well researched (as usual).

While Smallpox isn't as glamourous as Ebola, it's equally as deadly and more insidious. Preston traces the story of smallpox from discovery to eradication and the looming threat it poses again. He uses the recent scare over anthrax as the springboard for his tale.<br />Despite its melodramatic title, Demon is as compelling as Hot Zone while also less melodramatic. There is a very real problem of biological warfare facing the world. It's roughly where the threat of nuclear war was 50 years ago; if the threat isn't contained it could easily consume a world designed as a highway for viral infection.<br />Preston's book combines the best elements of journalism, science and suspense novels to carve out a tale that should keep every nation of the world awake at night. We can never turn out the light in assurance that the world is a safer place than yesterday. Tomorrow's promise looms with a lining of menace in a world where anyone can create deadly biological agents and strike terror in a nation's heart.	2003-03-30

Her inspired plotting, characters and imagination remind me of Robert Silverberg in his prime. The only other author currently writing that is comparable in depth and quality is, perhaps, Patricia Anthony.<br />Crossfire tells the story of an intergalactic ark that carries a number of wealthy volunteers to an unsettled Earth-like planet. Jake Holman,the president of the venture, is the smooth talking negotiator of the group that manages to arrange co-operation among a widely diverse population with different agendas for wanting to settle a new world. Most believe that Earth is on its last legs.<br />The planet that's been surveyed appears to have no life and the habitat is well suited to humans. There's one catch; after arriving they discover that there is intelligent life of sorts. A number of villages inhabited by what they call the Furs. There are three different groups, though: One appears docile and, upon examination, appears to have some sort of uniform brain damage; the second is unusually aggressive and attacks one group of settlers; the third appears to be chronically drugged but it's not clear by what. A number of clues indicate that the planet may be a \\"giant petri dish\\" and other aliens have some vast, poorly understood experiment going on.<br />Just when things couldn't get any worse an alien ship is detected entering the star system and will be in orbit in less than 36 hours.<br />Kress manages to create convincing characters with vastly different agendas. She also conveys the complex moral and ethical decisions facing these colonists. There are a number of minor flaws; Jake Holman is too reminiscent of Lyle Kaufman a character from Kress' Probability series. Still, there is just enough of a measured difference to make his character interesting and more than a carbon copy of the other character. The dark past haunting Holman that Kress keeps hinting at gives added gravity to the character and his actions.<br />The conclusion of the book isn't as smooth as expected. That's no surprise, however, as Crossfire, like Proability, was designed as a single, giant novel split into three volumes (at least that's what rumor has it as being). The second volume will be particularly interesting as it will resolve a number of conflicts and awkward situations that could leave humanity stranded in the crossfire of intergalatic war.<br />Keep writing Nancy, you're doing a heck of a job.conclusion of the book isn't as smooth as expected.

I love having this book around as I can never remember the title (or season) many of my fav episodes are on (Hollow Pursuits was one I couldn't recall for example and this book pointed me to the right DVD). By all rights an abridged version of this should have been included for each season of the DVDs.<br />The pictures are plentiful and although I would have preferred more backstory on the making of each episode (as well as behind the scenes photos), the info on each episode is fascinating. While this book doesn't sweep out all the dirt on the difficulities of Next Gen (for an accurate, well rounded story of the difficulties during Gene Roddenberry's second series I'd recommend Joel Engel's informed and well researched biography of the Great Bird of the Galaxy), there are a number of comments that hint at the difficult birth of Next Gen among them the large number of writer/producers that came and went prior to the arrival of Michael Pillar.<br />Next Gen really hit its stride during it's third and fourth season maintaining the quality for the bulk of the run of the series. Nemecek honestly asseses some of the worst episodes and the best. His comments from many of the writers also provides insight into the community writing method used to keep the quality high on Next Gen scripts. While this could and did work against some fine episodes, it also enhanced many of the best shows.<br />There is an exhaustive credit list of the writers/directors and guest actors for each episode. While this isn't the perfect Next Gen companion (perhaps an unoffical one will dig a little deeper into the struggles of the show and it's creative apex), it does provide a brief overview of each episode, credits and fairly objective overview on the various episodes strengths and weaknesses.	2003-03-04

Although there are holes in the novel (wouldn't any society advanced enough to send someone across the stars and come up with marvelous inventions be able to create the resources necessary to sustain it's society?).<br />The plot acts as little more than a narrative device in this character study. Like much of Tevis' other work (Mockingbird in particular), the story really is about an outsider's attempts to fit in with an uncaring society. The novel compliments Nicholas Roeg's classic film and vice versa. It isn't necessarily important to read the novel prior to the film but it will add an extra dimension to the experience.	2003-03-02

Selznick in Hollywood	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Mutt and Jeff of American cinema	They were the odd couple of cinema: Hitchcock's spry, intelligent thrillers were very much at odds with Selznick's adaptions notable for their fidelity to their source. Hitchcock, in contrast, was anything but faithful to the source material of his many film adaptions. Both adaptions and original material focused on key visual images around which the plot was built. Selznick was the opposite of Hitch in that his productions were focused more on the narrative. Their collaboration managed to enrich each other's skills.<br />Although they made few films together during their ten year \\"collaboration\\" (in reality Hitch was under contract so his status was more as suborindate than equal), most of them are hampered by their lack of cohesive styles. As producer/director they didn't hit their collborative stride until Hitch's Notorius in 1946. Most of Hitch's work was with other producers and studios for which he was loaned out like any other actor or director of the time.<br />Nevertheless, Hitch learned valuable lessons in structuring a film for the American audience. He also managed to reach an audience that he could only have imagined before coming to America. Selznick's most valuable lesson was learning to let his directors occasionally have their way on projects.<br />Leff's book is a bit too scholarly in tone for the average film fan but is well written and researched. It's also quite expensive given that it's a large format paperback (this probably has to do with the small audience imagined for it and the fact that it comes from the UC Press). Many of Leff's more interesting observations have turned up as commentary on a number of Criterion DVDs (particularly the Spellbound DVD released last year).<br />There were many classic films produced during their time together but just as many misfires (Spellbound, despite it's many attributes is a good example of the disasterous turn their collaboration could take). Hitch hadn't hit the height of his powers as a director yet. His most powerful films (Rear Window, North by Northwest, Vertigo, The Trouble With Charlie, Strangers on a Train, Psycho and The Birds)loomed in his future. Nevertheless, his films from this time frame are, at times, revolutionary in one way or another (Saboteur, Shadow of a Doubt, Lifeboat among many others).<br />This book details their work together from uneasy partnership to  the truce that allowed Hitch to produce one of his most magnificient films (Notorius). Although Hitch's work has come to dominate our culture more than Selznick's (with the possible exception of Gone With The Wind), neither man would have achieved his goals without the other.et.

Is it an attempt to cash in on the original novel? Is it an attempt to manufacture a &quot;franchise&quot;? The last option is always the best and most elusive; it's an attempt to recreate the power of the original work with something as bold and interesting.<br />Jeff Shaara's epic Gods And Generals falls into the latter category. His prequel to his father's monumental novel The Killer Angels manages to connect to the real life characters from this time period in just the same way. These people become flesh, blood and bone again with all the flaws and greatness inherent in the flesh. Shaara manages capture the little moments that made of the story of the men who eventually fight in the Battle for Gettysburg. Shaara captures the human core that suffers and falls during the chaos of war.<br />Perhaps every bit the equal of The Killer Angels (only time will tell if it ages as well), Gods And Generals allows us a window into the minds of those who participated in a pivotal moment in American history. What's most impressive is the fact that Shaara manages to capture all the flavor of the original novel without stuping to imitation. His prose is fluid and beautifully structured. A pity that the novel has segregated to the historical novel genre; it's much more powerful, horrorfying and touching than that. It's a crime to confine such a well written novel to such a small literary ghetto.	2003-02-19

While the series hasn't blossomed into mass market appeal, it has clearly reached an appreciative audience. The Prisoner exhibited all the best traits of great theater or film: the writing and direction was top notch; the material has transcended its era capturing the imagination of sucessive generations.<br />Fairclough's book is THE book to pick up on the series. Unlike The Prisoner Companion (different book and author(s)), The Offical Companion documents each episode with authority. It also has the plots for a number of scripts that co-creator George Markstein solicited but were rejected by McGoohan. One can see why McGoohan rejected them; his vision of the series ultimately turned out to be quite different from Markstein's.<br />The series plays like a variation on many of Kafka's themes. In this age of post X-Files paranoia, it's hard to appreciate just how groundbreaking The Prisoner was. Unlike a series like The X-Files, The Prisoner has stood the test of time because it's view of conspiracy is less a us vs. them approach and much more of the individual vs. the rest of society.<br />The book also gives compelling and interesting background on McGoohan. It raises his deep religious conviction as an important part to understanding the series. Born in the US but raised in Ireland, McGoohan, like No. 6, had his feet in two different worlds but didn't belong to either of them. The sense of alienation exhibited by the character and moral strength make No. 6 an anti-antihero.<br />The book is generously illustrated and is in a large format. Additionally, if you haven't purchased the series on DVD yet wait on picking up Arrival/The Chimes of Big Ben as the version included is identical to A&E's box set from two years ago. Be seeing you.	2003-01-03

His critical assessment of the various episodes is always well informed (although there are a couple that I do disagree with very strongly). The most important thing is that this groundbreaking gothic science fiction/horror series is finally being appreciated.<br />The Outer Limits was always a poor cousin to The Twilight Zone; critics preferred Rod Serling's O'Henry like twists and turns in the plot. Twilight Zone was a terrific series but it couldn't touch the one hour (or two hour)format. Likewise, the bulk of the audience preferred Serling's morality plays. What's fascinating is to compare and contrast the two--it's like comparing Steve Spielberg to Terry Gilliam; both are technically adept and brilliant filmakers but Gilliam's films have a dark vision missing, for the most part, from Spielberg's films. Spielberg always feels the need to lighten up even his darkest toned films. Gilliam has no such compunction.<br />Time has been kinder to The Outer Limits than The Twilight Zone. The series had no peer as a 1 hour gothic science fiction/fantasy/horror program. What made the series so appealing and great was the contrast in styles between Leslie Stevens' science fiction plot driven tales and Joseph Stefano's dark character driven morality plays. Their collaboration on the series brought out the best of both writers/producers.<br />Stevens created the series and let writer/producer Stefano do the day to day production of the show for the first season. The bulk of the most powerful episodes are from the first season. Stefano, like Rod Serling, had a hand in a large number of these scripts often writing originals, providing stories or rewriting other writers to make the episode fit the format, improve the drama or characters (or make it affordable to shoot).<br />Schow interviewed all the major participants in the series and has a wealth of memos, original scripts and background information on the show. I'd also recommend the boxset DVD of The Outer Limits. It contains all the first season episodes on 4 two sided double layer discs. There aren't any extras to speak of (which is too bad given that Stefano, Martin Landau, Martin Sheen and many of the actors are still alive).<br />The second season was more difficult for the show; Stefano left in a disagreement over pared down budgets and the demands to modify the series. There were still a number of outstanding episodes. One of the best episodes was Harlan Ellison's Demon with a Glass Hand. Robert Culp gives a startling, powerful performance in this episode. Ellison also contributed Solider (which was radically rewritten by others. It reflects the poor quality control at the time. Still, Solider has a number of interesting ideas and strong performances (chiefly Michael Ansara).<br />The best episodes -- The Galaxy Being, The Man Who Was Never Born, It Crawled Out of the Woodwork, OBIT, Feasability Study,Nightmare, The Chameleon, Demon with a Glass Hand, The Inheritors, The Form of Things Unknown, The Sixth Finger and The Man with the Power all rival the best written shows from the 60's and 70's. The new verison of the series, while it has many admirable moments, is closer to The Twilight Zone in spirit and lacks the sharp, engaging writing/direction of the original series.<br />The direction of The Outer Limits if often overlooked. Gerd Oswald, James Goldstone, Leslie Stevens and others strived to make the series look like short movies.

It seems that whenever he encounters conflict with his band he splits the band or threatens to leave. Perhaps part of it has to do with his initial discomfort as \\"leader\\". Regardless, this makes for compelling reading in Sid Smith's fine book on the Crimson King. Journeying from 1969 to the present incarnation of Crimson, Smith assesses the strengths and weaknesses of each incarnation with candor. He's also managed to track down and interview just about every member of the band past and present.<br />While I don't always agree with his critical comments about the various albums, line ups and songs, Smith's writing makes for a compelling and informed argument. Each incarnation of the band has produced notable and exceptional music but the most stable line ups (Fripp-Wetton-Cross-Brufford/Fripp-Belew-Levin-Brufford) are, of course, afforded the most space. Both have been the most powerful and consistent line ups in terms of the quality of music. They're also as different as can possibly be.He doesn't short the other line ups. The original line up gets plenty of space despite the fact that they only recorded one album. Smith also briefly focuses on their respective solo careers and other bands. The most interesting and conflicted of the line ups was the Fripp-Burrell-Collins-Wallace version that recorded Islands and Earthbound. There was an earthiness and blues/jazz element in this edition that was missing from later versions of the band. Smith manages to highlight the creative conflict that both created some enduring music (particularly on the Live in Jacksonville and Live at Summit Studios as well as Earthbound). Fripp was little more than a sideman in his own band at the end but it was a band that could create quite a noise!<br />The Fripp-Wetton-Cross-Brufford line up produced three studio albums (Cross left during recording of material for the last album)and one live album during their life time. This edition of KC had a distinctive European flavor to its prog rock sound. Cross violin helped accentuate this aspect of Crim. The band's most compelling albums (Lark's Tongue in Aspic and Red)were created in the fire of creativity and the burned out embers of the band's decline. Smith manages to give us an inside view of the conflicts, egos and critical press that created and destroyed the band.<br />The final line up (before the 7 year itch compelled Fripp to reform KC again)was originally going to be called Discipline. Smith displays a good understanding of what made this version tick. He also lays out the pressures that became its undoing (the conflict between Fripp & Belew over creative control and between Fripp & Brufford over \\"timekeeping\\"). He doesn't shy away from discussing the controversies about KC 80; he discusses the influence of Talking Heads (Belew was a member briefly during Remain in Light and toured with both David Bowie and Frank Zappa. It should be noted, however, that TH were also influenced by KC's 70's line up)and does acknowledge the difficulty of dealing with Fripp (he had Adrian Belew re-record the vocal to Cadence and Cascade and Tony Levin redo the bass part on a track from Lizard to \\"erase\\" former member Gordon Haskall from the band's history).<br />Fripp does get the last word but that's because it's his band (which he would deny). Nevertheless, Smith provides a fair balance assessment of the band from glory days to the aftermath of their implosion.

A fine book for KC fans to read that gives a unique perspective of the band.	2002-10-26

Freeson Dyson was involved in helping to develop a prototype spaceship called Orion powered by atmom explosions. While all of this might sound like it's from the science fiction movie The Conquest of Space or 2001: A Space Odyssey, Orion would have worked if not for a number of minor glitches. The atomic explosions would have propelled the 10 story rocketship into the atmosphere thereby releasing radiation and nuclear fall out into the environment. A scale model was launched using conventional chemical rockets and proved that it could be done.  Orion's days were numbered because of  the nuclear test ban treaty signed by Kennedy and politics.<br />The fantasy didn't quite end with the discovery of the potential environmental impact of Orion and the nuclear test ban treaty. Dyson and others discussed using conventional rockets to get the Orion into  orbit and then using the atomic &quot;engine&quot; once out of Earth's atmosphere. Unfortunately, Orion became the victim of politics and a changing world.  The original plan was to have Orion arrive at  Saturn by 1970 (just a year after the Moon landing with conventional rockets). We'd live in quite a different world if Orion had succeeded in moving from the drawing board to reality. We'd probably have toured the solar system by now .  On the other hand we'd also live in a world damaged by nuclear fallout and an increase in background radiation.<br />Dyson's breezy writing style makes this book accessible to both history buffs and casual readers as well. He has a good grasp of the subject matter due to his father's involvement. Dyson interviewed scientist involved in the creation of Orion and did research into the project via declassified papers. An interesting and compelling read that of the road not taken in space travel (for good and bad), Orion was a pipe dream that almost progressed to reality.<br />An interesting note is the fact that Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrick proposed using nuclear bombs to power the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Clarke was clearly inspired by the research done on Orion and this influenced the design of the Discovery for the film. Fiction almost mirrored reality and it's fascinating (and frightening ) to consider what might have been<br />There is some technical info in here but it's well explained and pretty straight forward.e is the fact that Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrick proposed using nuclear bombs to power the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey.

She manages to deal with the idea of shared or collective reality and how we define it in ways that Phil Dick would have imagined. She also brings a hard science edge to her writing that has, until recently, been on the back burner and secondary to her literary skills. Probability Moon is the first in a trilogy that deals with a number of common themes in a fresh way--first contact and humankind's responsibilities role in the universe.<br />Well writen and with a quick pace, Probability Moon isn't as powerful as her best work (Beggar's in Spain) but still manages to inject new life into a number of older sf themes. One of her strengths has always been character and narrative and, while both are important in this novel, they seem to be secondary to the hard sf setting and scientific details. Nevertheless, Kress' book is better written and thought out than most of her contemporaries. She's still one of the best writers working in a medium and genre that has fallen on cliches and formulas in the post Star Wars world.	2002-10-21

Lennon himself later dismissed many of the comments he makes in the book. Still, there are many sections where Lennon comes clean about The Beatles and his own problems. While it lacks objectivity, Lennon Remembers does provide a snapshot glimpse into The Beatles and their contemporaries that other books fail to do.<br />There's a boatload of bitterness that colors Lennon's comments about his working relationship with Paul McCartney. Lennon would later retract many of the things he said and elaborate on why he fibbed or didn't tell the whole story. For a fuller, more complete view of The Beatles and Lennon, I'd recommend Lennon's Playboy interview published shortly before his death as well as The Beatles Anthology. Both provide a bit of fair balance missing from Jann Werner's interview. Lennon himself was initially upset when Werner published these interviews in book form as he agreed to do them provided that didn't occur.	2002-10-21

What Anthology also reveals is that The Beatles weren't there by accident. They had the impact they did for the same reason that Elvis did; they changed the rules of the game and were playing a constant game of one upmanship. <br />Certainly there were other important bands from this period. The cultural impact the band had resulted as much from their talent as the press coverage of their every move. 40 years after their debut single Anthology manages to convey both the impact of the band and the changing values of the time they worked within. The book is packed with interesting tidbits, trivia and the band's unique perspective from inside the fishbowl of fame. <br />Anthology allows the band to tell their own story. With the murder of John Lennon over 20 years ago and the recent death of George Harrison, there are less and less eyewitnesses to a major shift in the cultural fabric that surrounds us. Anthology provides context and content as to why things changed in the 60's. They may not have been the catalyst of change but The Beatles made that change acceptable for good and bad.<br />In our modern fragmented culture, there are few performers that could continue to have the same impact that these four people did have. Anthology provides a fascinating glimpse into history from the inside out.	2002-10-21

Herken had access to The Smithsonian Archieves as well as interviews with the primary sources involved in the creation of the bomb. The book is a fair balanced account of the difficult personalities and politics that went into the creation of the first nuclear bomb and the later more powerful \\"super\\". Only two other books has been this impressive (both by Richard Rhodes)and exhaustive. Herken's book has the advantage of additional resources.<br />The personalities and egos of Oppenheimer, Teller and Lawrence contributed to the rise and downfall of each man. Oppenheimer's eventual ethical objections to the development of the super came as much from his personal beliefs as it did his distaste for Teller's ideas. Teller became a hawk regarding nuclear policy and, ultimately, his opinions on Oppenheimer contributed to his loss of his security clearence. Lawrence was as driven as both men and largely apolitical until politics and science intersected.<br />Herken's book is a fascinating portrait of the players and time that helped shape the modern world.	2002-10-21

I've often felt that most sf series are little more than marketing hooks to [get] you into reading subpar writing and cliched plotting. That said, Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have done a terrific job of telling the backstory of Dune. This first prequel sets the stage for everything that follows; the conflict between the Atraides and Harkonen families and the establishment of the empire. Amazon.com has done a fine job of presenting the plot so I'll focus on other areas.<br />Buterlian Jihad manages to breath life into characters mentioned in passing in previous books (including Frank Herbert's epic original books). Herbert and Anderson have managed to instill the books with much of the thought provoking themes and complex plotting that Frank Herbert did with the first three books of his series. The writing style is less stodgy than Frank Herbert's and a bit more accessable (in a good way). The downfall in all of Herbert's/Anderson's books is the dialog. While most of it is fairly well written some of it just doesn't work. On the plus side, the author's have managed to create a stable of memorable characters that can support such an epic story.<br />While not as important as Frank Herbert's original novels, the prequals to Dune create a credible universe where the first novel's history comes to life.	2002-10-21

American and British troops had survived the Bataan Death March in the Phillipines. These remarkable soliders survived three years in a horrible prison camp and were eventually liberated by the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion.<br />The story of their harrowing days in the death camps and ultimate salvation makes for inspired reading.

It's clear that Goldman was attempting to create the same furor with Lennon as he did with his Elvis Presley biography. John Lennon was a flawed, complex human being and Goldman presents the flaws with as the emblishment one expects from yellow Journalism. Like most fiction and sensationalistic biographies it makes for fascinating reading.<br />What's most interesting is that the very people that would benefit from Lennon's reputation being smugged are the very people that deny it's accurate. The late Ray Coleman's biography of Lennon rings truer (although it was written with the co-operation of those Lennon knew)and manages to convey many of the flaws that Goldman's book does. Coleman's book also presents the positive side without diving into the mud like Goldman's book.<br />Was John Lennon a saint? Certainly not but he wasn't quite the insecure monster that Goldman presents him as being. It seems there's a bit of truth here but most of it is buried in speculation. A pity as Goldman is a fairly good writer.	2002-09-08

John Fogerty's solo career has continued successfully and the remaining band members (John's older brother Tom died in 1990) have resumed touring as CCR Revisited. While they've managed to put some of the past difficulties with their old label behind them (via the lawsuits), Stu Cook, Doug Clifford and John Fogerty have never been able to settle the issues that tore this seminal rock band apart.<br />Bordowitz does a fine job of detailing the conflicts and legal tensions that caused the band to implode. Although they all contributed to the sound of the band (and the break up), Fogerty (naturally) got the lion's share of praise because he wrote, sang and produced the songs for the band. A musical polymath, Fogerty has never been able to distance himself from the emotional turmoil that their success generated.<br />The trouble with any nonfiction book about a band is that it's always going to be second hand information and interpretation despite the wealth of interviews included here. It's clear that whatever happend between the members was due to very complex dynamics. The author does a very good job of distilling the essence of the conflict between the four members. None of the band members are portrayed as saints and John Fogerty comes off as enormously talented but every bit the control freak.<br /> We'll never really know what went on within CCR except that it's clear that the very thing that drove them also tore them apart. The author manages to convey the conflicts through older and recent interviews with the participants. Sadly, Tom Fogerty isn't around any longer to shed any additional insight into what occurred.<br />The most heartbreaking and powerful chapter details the band's induction into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. John Fogerty made it very clear to musical director Robbie Robertson he wasn't going to perform CCR tunes with his old bandmates. It's sad because it was a shared moment of glory when Fogerty, Cook & Clifford could have put their difficulties behind them. Fogerty performed with the house band after Bruce Springsteen inducted them into the hall of fame.<br />The book is very fair balanced and the many rare photos (of the band at Tom Fogerty's wedding and performing at their high school reunion) add a nice perspective to the band's story. John's views are expressed via independently published interviews. Still, considering the \\"myth\\" that has grown up around the band, it is refreshing to hear both Cook and Clifford's point of view in addition to the three Fogerty brothers (non performer Bob is quoted as well).<br />It's a perfect companion to Craig Werner's CCR: An Oral History. Taken together, these two books convey the importance of CCR to music and also the difficulties that guarenteed they wouldn't remain together more longer.n't going to perform CCR tunes with his old bandmates.

A sad, talented at times pathetic human being with talent and great falws, Cobain was a bitter contradiction. Despite a his talent and success, he hated himself and his life. Cobain once commented on his \\"suicide genes\\" and, to be honest, it he had already written the last chapter in his life before it truly had a chance to begin.<br />There's no doubt that Nirvana had as much impact as the Sex Pistols and The Beatles in terms of the music world. Cobain and the band popularized a sound and helped create a movement they didn't want to be a part of. As ground breaking as Nirvana's sound was, they never managed to move beyond it. The band's albums are representative of what was happening in Cobain's life; the anger and brutality (as well as sadness and compassion) that dominated Cobain's life ultimately helped end it as well. This book illustrates the rise and descent of a popular artist. The vivid picture that emerges is of someone on a roller coaster ride to hell. Despite all of that, there's also tenderness and virtue on display as well. Cobain was merely a man caught in the cross hair of public life who didn't want to be there. The portrait that emerges confirms Cobain as troubled individual that couldn't come to grips with the demons that drove his art.<br />It's never better to burn out than fade away. Cobain chose the former without realizing the later is just as much myth. He never got a chance to come to grips with his demons and, ultimately, they tore him apart. This book is a snapshot of an artist as he tries to find ways to burn out faster than anyone before.	2002-08-17

Author Huchthausen is a former US Navy Captain which allows the author to provide unique insight into the portions of Captain Zateyev's memoirs published here for the first time.<br />This voulume is more for military history (and history)buffs than the casual movie fan. Be warned that there is a large amount of the big dedicated to presenting why subs were built the way they were and what misfortunes the Soviets (and the US) had with their nuclear class submarines. There's a large section devoted to pictures of the crew as well as scenes from the movie starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.<br />Well written and researched K19 is an outstanding book that presents a difficult period in world history from a very different perspective. We've all seen or heard the political side of what occurred during the cold war but rarely has there been a first hand account of what it was like on the front lines.<br />K19 manages to presents a difficult time in history with a well balanced view.	2002-07-19

This fine book corrects a lot of &quot;myths&quot; about the films (such as the fact that screenwriter Michael Wilson came up with the &quot;hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&quot; scene and the fact that Rod Serling's original screenplay was a mess)and reminds us how groundbreaking this first science fiction film series was.<br />Although memories occasinally differ as to who did what (most notably about the twist ending of the first film. There has been some debate as to who came up with it although it clearly has Serling's fingerprints all over it),the authors have put together a terrific volume that works both as film history and puts the films in their historical perspective. Sure they're all entertaining (some to a lesser degree than others) but the first film (and to a lesser extent the sequels)works both as allegory and social satire in the tradition of Swift's Gulliver's Travels.<br />The book is stocked with rare photos (including a series of stunning photos from Lydia Heston's private collection)and great interviews. If you're an Apes fan this terrific book is a perfect companion to the DVD re-release of the films (and the making of documentary that aired on cable a couple of years ago). My only complaint is I would have liked to see a bit more of the Apes memorabilia reproduced perhaps even in a separate section.<br />What's surprising is the impact these films have had over the past 30 years. Although some of the participants would go on to bigger things (director Schaffner's classic Patton and Serling's stint as creator/host/writer on the uneven Night Gallery series), none of their efforts has had the impact of this fine series of films. Although it's taken over 15 years to for this fine book to finally see the light of day it was well worth the wait!	2001-08-05

While there's no doubt that Hitchcock is still a giant in cinema, many of the books written about him tend to focus only on Hitch's contribution. DeRosa's book provides fair balance and recognizes writer Joh Michael Hayes' contribution to a fruitful collaboration. The four pictures that Hayes worked on (Rear Window, The Trouble With Harry, To Catch A Thief and the remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much)are all among Hitch's best work as a director. This isn't to suggest that Hitch didn't contribute to story ideas; he would frequently sketch out a general plot but writers like Hayes (or Ernest Lehman to name another strong Hitch collaborator) would be left along to write the script once the basic plot was discussed.<br />DeRosa knows his stuff and his research is exhaustive. I would have to liked to have seen more storyboard to script comparisons and comments from other writers and directors but that probably would have changed the scope of the book (and the focus). Without tarnishing Hitch's reputation, Writing With Hitchcock makes a strong case for the importance of Hayes contribution to Hitch's film.<br />After they had a falling out Hitch would frequently dismiss Hayes contributions to his films in print( such as in Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock. Hitch was generally pretty good about recognizing the importance of his collaborators)<br />Luckily that bitterness can't color the fine work of these well matched collaborators. This book along (with the inteviews Hayes granted for the DVD editions of their four films) finally puts it all into perspective. It also allows one to celebrate the great art and entertainment of Hitch and Hayes.	2001-07-04

Hooper has put considerable thought into the emergence of HIV infection. As to whether he is right you'll have to make up your own mind. I found Hooper's book both fascinating because of the detail and some of the conclusions Hooper comes up with to explain the sudden appearence of HIV/Aids related viruses.<br /><br />There is also much food for thought that argue against Hooper's conclusions about the origin of HIV/AIDS. Having said that, though, there are still too many unanswered questions about the process that was used to create the early live polio vaccine using the kidney cells of chimps. Is it possible that the development of vaccines using animal tissue could have passed along disease to humans without our knowledge? Hooper provides strong arguments in his favor that the species jump occurred not because someone \\"ate\\" chimp meat or was bitten by an infected chimp but through vaccination at a time when cross species disease was relatively unknown to science.<br /><br />The least that can be said about this book is that Hooper asks some provocative questions that no one has answered completely. Even if he is wrong (and we'll never know as long as the scientific community doesn't investigate his theories with less rancor and examines the early polio vaccines in storage) Hooper has provided considerable food for thought;will a world altered because of immunization have less risks (or just different ones)?<br /><br />Will you believe Hooper's conclusions? He provides a huge amount of evidence both hard and circumstantial in his favor however there's also a substanial amount of information arguing against Hooper's point-of-view. You'll have to make up your own mind until the scientific community can completely dismiss Hooper's theory or, at the very least, until they can put more information out there refuting Hooper's arguments point-by-point.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-24

The word tragic shows up in descriptions of Badfinger quite a bit,but it doesn't begin to do justice to this terrific band's sad story. This second edition of the book cleans up a handful of minor errors and misstakes that appeared in the text of the original version. It also includes an additional chapter on the recent court case that involved the original members (and the estates of two decease members). There are also a number of photographs that didn't appear in the original edition and a complete discography that includes the latest reissues of the band's material.<br />Nevertheless, the inside look at the manipulators and sharks in the music business is a very good cautionary tale for modern musicians. Ultimately, this is a tale all too common in the music business. Although all four members of Badfinger were talented songwriters and singers, Matovina focuses accurately portrays Pete Ham as the driving force behind the band. The unique chemistry of the four members was still an important factor in this fine band and Matovina doesn't sell the other members short. If there is a villian in this story it was the short sightedness of the band and the person they chose to manage them in the United States. If the band had a flaw it was its inability to look past the bs of the business and their trusting nature.<br />Matovina does a terrific job of drawing a full picture of all the members of the band. He manages to provide the best insight into Pete Ham (the most talented singer/songwriter in the band). Ham is a complex figure who, when under emotional distress, habitually puts out cigarettes on his hands. Ham commuicates his emotions through his songs, and is a good friend to everybody but, unfortunately, no one is able to get close to Ham and help him with the enormous burden of trying to keep Badfinger together.<br />Matovina also manages to capture the other members of the band with the same detail. The chapters on the band's post-Ham years are both as tragic and compelling as those written about the first incarnation of Badfinger. Evans and Molland's struggle to revive the band and the indifference they faced is particularly interesting given the band's previous success.<br />Eventually the pressures caught up with everyone in Badfinger. It's impact was sharp and explosive for two members of the band resulting in their suicide. In many respects the aftermath of the implosion of this great band resembles a messy divorce; all the participants had their own agenda and couldn't get past their own personal issues.<br />The inclusion of the 71 minute CD provides a series of snapshots of the band from beginning to the very bitter end. Most of these tracks haven't been available before (with the exception of poor sounding bootlegs). We get to hear one of Pete Ham's first demos for the band along with their first offical studio recording made under the supervision of the Kinks' Ray Davies. We also get to hear a number of Iveys' demos that were never performed by the band after their name change. These demos range in quality from interesting (Take Good Care of My Baby)  to terrific (She Came Out of the Cold and a live version of Maybe Tomorrow sans the overbearing string arrangement on the original).<br />Included on this disc are 5 interviews with Ham and original member Tom Evans. It provides further insight that compliments the book. We get to hear (in their own words) both the highs and lows that drove the band to produce some of their most enduring work. The CD ends with one of Ham's last demo recordings (the powerful Ringside which Matovina produced for the posthumous Pete Ham solo album 7 Park Avenue) and an unreleased pair of Tom Evans demos from his brief  post-Badfinger career.<br />Matovina provides more than one smoking gun in the book demonstrating that the forces that tore this band apart wasn't jealousy as much as the vultures in themusic industry. Without You is both a powerful reminder of the evil in the music industry and the talented individuals that are victimized by these vultures.the music industry.

Pacelli was  very much a man of his time and that, along with the fact that he became  pope at a cruial moment in history, is unfortunate. We can't expect the  average man or woman to transcend the views of their time, but we should  expect it of our leaders. In that regard, Pacelli failed humanity, the  Catholic Church and, ultimately, the papcy.<br />Any historian approaches his  subjects with a certain amount of bias (just as any author of a scientific  or medical study knows what outcome they want to prove prior to writing the  protocol for a study). That doesn't discredit the results as long as the  work is well documented.	1999-11-29

Combining elements of pulp narrative within literary trappings, Stephenson manages to invest his story with wit, history and inscrutable characters. Although not quite as compelling as Snow Crash, this book shows tremendous  growth of Stephenson as an author.<br />Like most of Stephenson's book this  uses an elipticl narrative and epic length (as well as epic quality) to  highlight the extraordinary actions of (for the most part) ordinary, but  talented people. I was a little surprised while reading it as initially the  plot didn't sound like it would be compelling (and slogging through the  first 100 pages, like all Stephenson books, was a bit of a chore).<br />Stephenson still needs to develop his characters a little more fully.  Character development is all too frequently sacrificed to pithy  observations, or one diminsonal quirkiness masquerading as character.  Still, he is far and away of one of the most talented writers of his  generation.<br /> I couldn't put it down.	1999-06-17

Some problems crop up, however, as there are errors throughout the book on specific bands that even the casual fan would catch. Hey, I'm not a fan of all these bands, but I caught most of the  errors. There are also proof reading errors throughout the book.<br />These  points aside, most of the reviews are fairly well written and informed.  Whether or not you agree with the opinions expressed, the authors generally  have solid reasoning for their comments. Still, one could wish for better  accuracy for a book that is supposedly so comphrensive.<br />Hey guys, if  you're looking for an additional writer I'm available!	1999-05-18
US	52569116	RI1DFPGPIEX3Y	0060175966	418849151	The Professor and the Madman	Books	5	1	2	N	N	As compelling as any fictional suspense thriller	Suspenseful, compelling and thoughtful, this nonfiction book about the creation of the Oxford dictionary and the mentally unbalanced murderer that contributed to the creation of said dictionary is fascinating.<br />Winchester captures the atmosphere and the conflicting personalities  that helped to create Oxford dicitionary. He follows the two main  characters reflected existence; one born into money and talented, descents  into madness, while the other from humble beginings ascends to respect and  acclaim.<br />As they used to say, a great read. This book has all the  characters of a great novel but, ironically enough, is drawn from life.  Highly recommended.	1998-12-23

I have to admit I was a little disappointed. While the book doesn't pretend to be comphrensive, it lacks an sort of  objectivity and analysis from Farmer.  Altogether, it isn't a bad place to  learn about the band if your a neophyte, but, for those of us who have been  faithful for many years, it could have used a little bit more insight on  the part of the author and the artists.	1998-11-12

The word tragic shows up in descriptions of Badfinger quite a  bit, but it doesn't detract from the wonderful musical legacy of the  band.<br />Nevertheless, the inside look at the manipulators and sharks in the  music business is a very good cautionary tale for modern musicians.<br />Matovina does a terrific job of drawing a full picture of Pete Ham the  most talented singer/songwriter in the band. Ham is a complex figure who,  when under emotional distress, habitually puts out cigarettes on his hands.  Ham commuicates his emotions through his songs, and is a good friends to  everybody but, unfortunately, no one is able to get close to Ham and help  him with the enormous burden of  trying to keep Badfinger together.<br />A  highly recommended book.	1998-10-13
US	52569116	R2OH2NGIUQ44TT	0316233706	896551855	To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Interesting, but far from definitive book on the Eagles	Eliot probably could have devoted quite a bit more space to this  sprawling, ambitious book. Because Henley is the only Eagle to give input  into the book, the focus is pulled away from the other band members.  Although Eliot follows the trevails of Frey, Meisner and Leadon, he  virtually ignores, or spends little time on the other band members beyond  their immediate involvement in the band and, instead, focuses quite a bit  of time on &quot;unofficial&quot; band members Jackson Browne and J. D.  Souther.<br />The book would have earned five stars if Eliot had spend a  little more time on reflecting as to the true dynamic between Henley and  Frey. We get little sense of true reason they were drawn together as  collaborators beyond some superficial analysis.<br />A good template for Eliot  to have followed would have been  Mark Hertsgard's excellent book on the  Beatles, A DAY IN THE LIFE. That book was unauthorized and had absolutely  no input from any of the band members, but still comes off as a stunning  analysis as to what made the band click, their place in music history,  their influence and, finally, the collaborative process of Lennon and  McCartney.<br />Eliot hasn't written a bad book, but it is a little on the  lite side. If Eliot hadn't been so ambitious he could have easily put  together a great book focusing on Henley/Frey, the band, or the souther  California scene that contributed to the band's formation and success.  Instead, he tries to focus on all of the above in a brief, superficial  book.<br />Nevertheless, Eliot has some compelling stories to share and  Henley's short involvement with the book makes it  of interest to most  fans. Read it in the bookstore, or at the library.	1998-10-12

This  novel(and the sequels that followed)are as sophisticated and complex as  anything by Pynchon or Joyce but incorporate a more commerical narrative  structure. The first two novels in this &quot;series&quot;(I use the term  loosely because of the time frame the series covers)are among the best  fiction produced in the past 20 years. Simmons, along with his more  unconventional contemporary Stephenson, is among the best authors currently  writing.<br />The ideas, situations and characters are all sophisticated and  have considerable depth. It's clear that Simmons is trying to structure a  narrative with a thematic structure comparable to the fiction of a Homer or  Joyce(two authors at other ends of the spectrum).<br />I can highly recommend  this book. Give it a chance and you'll be sucked into its world. Easily the  most comprehensive world created since Herbert's DUNE series.	1998-09-07
