Each chapter is a week, and most are only a few pages.  At first I was a little put off by this, but after reading the first chapter I understood the reason.  The chapters are short because Ms Franklin does not fluff up her lessons.  And this is not what I was expecting.  With subjects like chakras and auras I assumed this was going to have a lot of stuffing in with the meat, as most books do dealing with this subject.  I only gave the book five stars because I am only starting the course and will re-review it after I have finished.	2004-03-08

This is one of the best books about the wheel of the year.  I would recomend this to some one who is converting from cristianity to some sort of pagan religion.  This book explains the pagan influences in the christain year, mostly Catholic, in a clear informative way.  This is also a great book to read if you are just plan interested in pagan customs.  Now this doesn't give any riruals this is purely a scholarly work, but well worth the read.  Blessed Be!	2004-02-07

No pun intended, the gems are not the gemstones but the relaxation exersize at the begining of the book, embracing the goddess and god meditations, working with the elements section, and using meditation beads section.  These are the true gems of this book.  The spells were alright.  They informed you of the goddess and stone that were to be used.  The guides meditations are nice, and poetic.  There is a section at the end of each spell that gives you advise on how to further bring the purpose of that spell into your life.  My favorite parts were the priestess speaks, they were very uplifting.  I will be using the last few sections of this book often and also the relaxation technique that she offered earilier in the book.  I am also going to look at her prayer books, her poetry is very beautiful.	2003-10-20

In her introduction she she said she wanted to help people discover a better relationship with the spirit.  She wanted to help all those divoced from spirit to find there way home.  Ms. Sylvan has a wonderful sence of hummor that made the book so enjoyable.  At the end of her chapters she offers us three things to think about.  And does she give you so questions, WOW.  I am currently searching for my own spiritual tradition with the lead questions.  I really love the second half of the book, the book of moonlight.  Sylvan writes beautiful poetry.  I an looking forward to using her muse to make my own rituals.  A must for those lost Wiccans who are looking for a way back to that at home feeling.	2003-10-16

With such falsities as wicca being an ancient matriachal religion, and that wicca is goddess based, it is a wonder this hasn't gotten worse reviews.  I have read books by this author before and enjoyed them, but if you are looking for a good book about wicca I would suggest Cunningham's guide for a solitary practitioner.  When you get past the intorduction about the craft and get into the rest of the book, such as nature spirits and other invisible helpers, and the book of spells the content is more barible, but not deffinatly not worth the price of this book.  If you are still interested take a trip to you local book store and read a few sections before you buy it.  I wish I would have.	2003-09-07

This book is seperated into three diffrent parts, The Beauty of the World, The Paragon of Animals, and In Apprehension,How Like a God.  <br />The first section is started with what he calls First degree initations rituals.  They are the rite of wiccaning, self-dedication, and initation.  He then goes into a creation myth.  A very beautful piece at that.  When he finnished with the creation of the world he then tells us of a theroy of the great migration of human kind from africa.  Having never before heared this in a book about wicca I was very impressed.  Creation and population are often left out of wicca text and that is a very importent part of the world.  He then talks about rituals offering information from all of the worlds cultures. This section is then concluded with a section about plant lore and the importence of people saving the plants.<br />The second section starts with handfasting and house blessing rituals, also seen by the author as second degree initations.  The Sabats and Esbats are then discused in wonderful detail.  He then gives and example of the Greek and Roman calanders and thier holidays.  Also discussed in this section is the lunar calider and it's pros and cons in today's world along with historical evidance for and against it's use.  In the middle of this section is what I feel is one of the most beautiful parts.  It is the book of the soul.  This inspiring part is well worth the price of this book alone.  To end this section is what is called the study material for the second degree.  This is coined as animals.  <br />Section Three starts out with a stong and much needed message.  It is about leadership and organizations in the pagan cummunity.  Something most witches I know have very little information on.  After much on soul and mind ther is a part on the after life, and how some groups see this relm.  He talks about a summerland and a winterland.  Multiculteral examples are givenfor both.  After that is the bool of humanity.  The study material for the third degree.  After a breff intoduction a large and extensive alphabetical guide on diffrent dieties it given.  This is a very large section and also makes this book a [bargain].  If you buy this book for nothing other than this part it is still a great investment.  <br />I recomend this book for any wiccan, pagan, or seeker of a diffrent path.  This book is written with objection by a man who teaches us to ebrace eachothers diffrences and learn from them.  Any book with a refrence to captin planet is down to earth, pun intended.  Another great book by ths author is wicca for couples.  Both are fundamental for bringing wicca into the new age of tollerance.	2003-09-03

She wicca out of the just ritual trappings and teaches you to live wicca.  The first part of this book is a great self help manual.  She gives activities that every one should try.  It will help you to see your self in a divine light, and make it brighter if you already do.  She then gives examples of how to use daily chores such as cooking and clipping cupons in a magickal way.  A great book for people who are finding it hard to apply magick in there every day lives.

I just finnished this book and I am floored at the spiritual nature of it.  In the introduction thier is a list of fifty things to apply for enchanted living.

The first is about connecting your self with your sences.  It gives informative examples from Ms. Telesco's life and wonderful activities to help you.  The second section have four path and a discription of each.  The paths are healer, teacher, warrior, and visionary.  The discriptions are given in a shaminatic, budist, islamic, and elemental sections.  The cross culteral ties in really well.

When I fist got my Goddess cards I was intriged by the art.  I ordered them on line and didn't get a good look at them.  I was amazed at how life like the cards look.  Some of the clothing is a bitt goofy looking, like the goddess' Elen's dress of ferns.  I was even more surprized when I did my first reading.  I used one of the lay out provided in the book.  It was teh one called Brighid's Arrows.  It was right on the money.  I don't even get reading that good with my Tarot cards.

The spells that she said could be used to controll some one gave me a great refrence to use to avoid such spells.  There are other great tidbits took.  I like the vacuming out of evil spirits.

I love the every part of this book.  It even gives spells using cat parts, but only the good kind such as shed wiskers and claws.  A must for any mystical person with a magickal cat.	2003-06-09

I learned about the feast of cake and ale, which is left out of most of the pagan books I have read.  And not only is this given for one person to do it also gives an example of when two or more people ar participating.  I love the light hearted style and the true student feeling I get from her writting.  Another taisty tidbit found in this book is her examples of rituals for every moon phase.  And last but not least is the glossery of moon dieties from around the world, and not just goddesses either.	2003-06-09

A great read for understanding the relationship of the goddesses in many diffrent patheons.  However the guieded meditations in the back are a little diffrent.  I would seggest reading other books on goddess worship before you choose this form of connection.	2003-06-09

It was a wonderful read and an even greater kitchen companion.  I love the simple recipies given in the first part of the book so that when you find a recipie with in the pages you are instructioned to death with the retellign of the basic steps.  I would recomend this for any one who enjoys making and loving there own stuff.  This is a great way to get in touch with the energies put into the beverages used for cerimonies also.  wine was wine until I made it my self.	2003-06-09

Once again Conway has given us a book about many diffrent culturals.  This one is the lunar aspect of that.  I love how it is set up on a moon month system allowing one to feel as if they were traveling the year as they are reading the text.  I love the suggested rutuals for each month too.  A great guide for beginers of moon magick.  A must have for any Conway fan.	2003-06-09

That is one of the few things it had going for it.  The problem I found was the added zodiac, and the fact that it had no real place.  There wasn't even enough information to tell you about what time of year it was.  And where did the information about this New zodiac &quot;Arachne&quot; come from.  There was good information on the Dark aspects of the moon, But is still can't grasp Arachne and when exactly this happens.  My advice is to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy some tidbits	2003-06-08
