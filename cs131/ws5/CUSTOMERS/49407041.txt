Well, I think taking that writing course in Prague affected Madame Steinbach's ability to tell an engaging story!  This book was SOOO boring!  I cracked up laughing reading another reviewer's comment that the \\"shepherding\\" chapter was more boring than the garden one because I had the same impression.  I didn't even finish the last chapter.  Maybe I should have, it could have helped my insomnia.  Frankly, the relationship with Naruhiro makes my skin crawl.  The way she writes about this man is not appealing at all.   <br /> <br />And if she asked one more person in a non-Anglo-Saxon country if they were inspired by an American or English artist, writer, gardener, etc., I thought I would scream.  How horribly insulting to other cultures.  But that is so American - everything in the world must revolve around them these days.  And I know, I am one but thankfully don't live there anymore.	2005-05-31

As a New Englander who was only 6 years old at the time of the inauguration, I can no longer tell if I remember watching the Inaugural or if over the years seeing the newsclips and videos at the JFK Library have indelibly stamped his words in my brain.  In any case, the book made me want to hear the speech again.  A visit to the Library during my next visit to Boston may be in order. <br /> <br />One bone to pick.  How is it that a regular person like me constantly finds errors in books that seem to be otherwise well-researched and the editors don't catch them?  Henry Fonda's ex-wife who was at Joseph Alsop's party was named Afdera, not Alfreda.  Errors like that drive me nuts.	2005-02-06

When I was a single woman, I got it in my head to move from Boston to Nantucket, not knowing a soul or really knowing much more than how the island was during the 2 weeks in July I would go there every year.  Like the author, I found a little cottage that had been loved long ago, built in the 50's and abandoned.  I bought it on the spot when I saw it and proceeded to make Nantucket my home for many years until meeting my husband and being swept off to Europe and marriage at age 45.  I felt like I was reading a ot of my own story as Kate swept me up in her adventures of builders and plumbers and the hazards of trying to do a project of this scope as a single woman.  This would make a great movie I think!  And the next time I come home for a visit I am going to try and find this wonderful little cottage with the cottage attached.	2004-10-03

If you looked at Dare Wright superficially you would think she had it all together, a beautiful model, photographer, author.  But Jean Nathan wrote a fascinating and chilling story.  The Lonely Doll books were among my childhood favorites and I have given an entire set that I collected over the years (with the help of Cathy Niswonger who is mentioned toward the end of the book) to my nieces.  And they are not so interested in them!  So my sister and I read them and recall our childhoods like it was yesterday. <br /> <br />One other point.  The reviewer who mentioned the film Grey Gardens - do you recall the name of the two women in it?  Big Edie and Little Edie!  Kind of creepy after reading this book!  I will definitely be keeping this one in my library.	2004-10-01

My sister told me to get this book - she raved about it, couldn't say enough wonderful things about it.  Well, I bought it, paid too much to have it shipped to Europe from the US and it has taken me 5 days to read maybe 20 pages.  I HATE this book and do not understand the fuss.

I feel like I am reliving my childhood which is a bit odd because my childhood would have decidedly been on the other side of the tracks from the author's.  My grandmother, in fact, was one of those large, warm, cuddly Irish women who worked for families like the Colts and Atkinsons.  Until her death she received loving cards and letters from the children that she cared for (reading some of the names in this book, I believe they might be cousins).  To me, this narrative transcends the class structure of the 60's in the US.  Times have changed, my best friend is from one of those WASP families and 70 years ago our paths never would have crossed.  The author tells his story and his family's story in a way that makes me feel he is telling the story of us all.  This book made me sad and elated at the same time.  I think deep down, people are more alike than different.	2004-07-08

I loved this book!  When I first visited Paris and London about 8 years ago I bought Suzy's Born to Shop books for those cities.  Little did I know that in 1998 I would meet the man who would become my husband, rescue me from old maidhood and sweep me off my feet to live in Switzerland.  Now I know Paris better than I know NYC and have had some similar adventures (well, not the Count story) myself.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading Suzy's story, cheered her on, laughed at some of the language gaffes (been there, done that).  And I truly hope that she is in the process of writing a sequel.  Suzy, your readers are dying to hear about the Provenal house and your further adventures!	2004-05-27

I had already guessed, like another reader, that the Swartz's were really the Ovitz's and in a blog online there is an actual reference to a story about how Ovitz's son peed in the front yard and then told the nanny that she was not his boss!

I didn't like her as a person and never really got to care about her or what happened to her.

I had tears running down my cheeks (on the bus!) while reading about Paul going to Paris for the Princess's body.  Being a royal servant is not a life I would like, I would have told each of them, including Diana, where to go on more than one occasion.  Well, I suppose there would have been just the one occasion and then they would have booted me out the door.  But you can really tell that the author adored his job, loved the Princess and was deeply loyal to all the Royal Family.  Why the family objects to this book is beyond me when there has been some real schlock out there since Diana died.  But please, Paul, if you ever read this - thank your lucky stars for Maria!

That opening sentence just grabbed me and pulled me in for days and days.  The prose is almost hypnotizing.  I could not put this book down.  I also read the Wreck of the Whaleship Essex and even though Una's version of the shipwreck is fictional, to me the way they survived was written in a mystical, mystery way.  To the naysayers, it is extremely plausible that Una would meet lots of famous people in Nantucket and Boston.  New England is a relatively small place and in the 1800's was even more so.  I myself lived on Nantucket until recently for over 10 years and crossed paths with the rich and famous daily.  And New England, especially Nantucket, is a beautiful place, neither bleak nor stormy, except when one wants it to be.  I just hope this does not turn into a movie starring Julia Roberts, let Una live in our imaginations.	2003-08-21

I really felt like the author was sitting down with me telling the story of her life.  Unlike other books of this genre, there is some real life stuff going on, some of it truly heartbreaking.

I finished the book, thought it was so poorly written, researched, everything, that I wanted to give it NO stars but then found I couldn't post without at least one!  There are so many spelling errors of well-known names and places that it drove me nuts.  Other readers are correct when they point out that the author pretends to know what Christa was thinking and feeling during major events in her life when she knew her as well as I did which is not at all.  The author repeats the same things over and over and over, ad nauseum.  Great way to pad out a book so one can charge for more pages. And some of the things that she wrote about the people in her community were so insulting and appalling, she should probably think about relocating because I bet she's not on anybody's guest lists this season.	2003-07-11

The way it hop, skips, jumps from one part of their lives to the next and back again is confusing.  Not one of the children is introduced at their birth by their name and date of birth.  In fact in one paragraph, Rene is said to be 4 months pregnant and two paragraphs later it states &quot;Rene and the baby arrived.&quot;  What baby?  Boy or girl?  It never says. Later you read that six-month old Timmy died in his sleep.  First time you ever hear the kid's name and was he the new baby or the first born?  Very confusing.  Too bad they didn't have a good editor because I got so annoyed that I gave up.  But then again, when growing up in the US in the 60's I had absolutely no interest in the space program (still don't) so maybe that was part of it.	2003-06-30

When I ordered this book I thought I was buying an expos about life at Ciro's in it's heyday, with emphasis on celebrities.  Light summer reading, you know..  But this book is not about that and I could not have been more surprised or pleased.  Sheila Weller's experiences as an adolescent trying to fit in with the Popular Girls rings so true that I felt like I was in Junior High again, only with her.  The painful stories she relates about her family, especially about her father, made me think she must be a wonderfully strong woman to be able to write with such honesty.  And with a wry sense of humor threaded throughout, even in the painful parts of her story.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to more from this author.	2003-04-03

While the Tony Jackett, Ginny Binder and Jay Critchley stories were interesting, the rest was junk.

However, the author was so inconsistent with his terminology for the North End of Boston where a lot of the story occurs.  He refers to it as the North Side, North Boston, Little Italy but only once as the North End, which is what everyone in Boston calls it and nothing else.  When I read North Side, I would think I was reading about Chicago, when I read Little Italy, I thought it was New York.  Since the action takes place in a number of different cities, consistency with the correct name for the area would have appreciated.  Having lived there for nearly 20 years, it annoyed and distracted me and seemed like such a ridiculous error to make.  Otherwise, I thought the story was gripping.	2001-06-18

In fact, after author calls her daughter &quot;the child Iseault&quot; one time too many for me (and this was after only about 20 pages), I actually wrote in the margin how grating on my nerves this was.
