M/X goes off on some ideas that would still make many people squirm, such as his idea that \\"Any Black person who registers as a Democrat or a Republican is a traitor to his people.\\" What Black politican today would say this? He also stresses that the main thing for African-Americans to do is to undo the damage to the self-esteem of Black people done by slavery and Jim Crow (another capital idea seldom heard-but needed to be said-today). He warns against reactionary picketing against foolish and symbolic issues and bluntly states that if it's an idea that you aren't worth dying for, then you shouldn't demonstrate at all! <br /> <br />Ideas tof this kind are seldom heald even from so-called \\"militant\\" leaders of today, who thrive on theatrics and shock value as opposed to concrete ideas for the betterment of the masses. I also like his take on white liberals (\\"John Brown should be your standard\\") although I disagree to an extent with a few ideas (such as his take on Rev. Bruce Klunder, a Cleveland martyr) but one does not have to agree with someone 100% to recognize sincerity and brilliance. Read it and think!	2005-08-28

Black Red Shirts in South Carolina During Reconstruction	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Good look at hidden history	Edmund Lee Drago does a good job in his use of primary sources to create what is essentiually a docmuentary history of the Black Red Shirts. <br /> <br />To novices-The \\"Red Shirts\\" of South Carolina formed after the KKK was outlawed as the terrorist schock troops desgined to get the (mostly Black) Republicans out of power during the Reconstruction era. Sadly, it worked. Dr. Drago disscusses the littel-known fact that a number of these men were actually Black! He explains why this has not been publicized over the years (and not JUST for the obvious reasons) and provides us with transcripts of trial testimonies of the political violence of Reconstruction-era South Carolina as well as WPA Slave Narrative interviews with ex-slaves in the 1930s who rode with the Red Shirts in their youth. Since the latter two come from the own words of the participants, it adds to the value as I am personally quite fond of books that use documentary histories and books of obscure history. <br /> <br />As is the case of Larry Koger's \\"Black Slaveowners\\" and a book I once read  (whose title I forget) about men of remote Jewish ancestry who served as Nazis, this goes to show that history does not always follow nice neat lines of logic.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-18

The story of Maurice Joly, the Frenchman whose heroic attempt to bring down the tyranny of Napoelon III in the form of the \\"Dialogues in Hell\\" is quite interesting and tragic, bringing to light the tale of a martyr to his ideas who has been reduced to a historical footnote. Eisner subtly hints of the tragedy that Joly's well intentioned work to bring down a dictator would be grossly taken out of context to create the PROTOCOLS which caused nothing but the spread of evil and ignorance (I have read the PROTOCOLS in entirety and have reviewed it elsewhere). <br /> <br />The scene with some people dislike due to the length, in which Joly's \\"Dialogues\\" are compared chapter by chapter with the PROTOCOLS, is necessary for those who do not have access to either work to put the whole story in proper context. <br /> <br />Overall, this is good popular history that NEEDS to be read. May God bless the memory of Will Eisner who tried to use his art for such a noble purpose. As an African-American, this work has inspired me to do something similar about an equally fraudulent document plaguing the Black community known as the WILLIE LYNCH LETTER to stop that widely-believed nonsense.	2005-08-14

I have heard a rare recording of the underrated hero Medgar Evers speaking once, and no he was not a \\"personality cult\\" leader who dazzled the masses with snappy slogans, but a sincere individual who appealed to people on the grounds of reason and integrity.    In texts such as the 1958 Ebony magazine article and the 1963 television show in Jackson, Miss (where he lived and died), he appeals to those unconvinced by his fight against segregation to put themselves in his place. His stands for human dignity as described in his NAACP reports in the book is heartwarming when you consider that he risked his life to make such statements.     The Life of Evers cries out for a DVD or an \\"American Experience\\" episode. Unfortuantely, the so-called \\"leaders\\" and their paper-tiger soundbyte \\"causes\\" of today are a far comedown from the true heroes of Evers' era (and Mrs. Myrlie Evers herself makes this point in far more polite terms in her intro). Sadly, most of the truly great ones like Evers are now dead. Hopefully, this will inspire a future generation to get it right and back on track.	2005-07-03

I just finished reading this and I do have to give MED some credit for at least trying to show another dimension to the Cos by showing a more militant side of the Jello icon (there is a forgotten 1969 Playboy interview where Cos sounds surprisingly like Malcolm X that he includes) and he gives credit for what good the Cos does while also giving some historical analysis on the issue of Classism in Black America. THAT I can respect because the research here is pretty good and the facts he reveals are quite interesting. On the subject of the offbeat names many of the Black poor (often) give their children, he makes a good point that no one today denigrates the parents of Oprah Winfrey, Condoleeza Rice, and Shaquille O'Neil for doing the same with their now-famous offspring (however, he almost blows his point by forgetting that \\"Condoleeza\\" is not a made up-name, but a musical term). <br /> <br />However, as a whole, the book follows the sad tradition of much of today's supposedly political writing. The right wingers are quick to demonize the poor, but are reluctant to hold the rich and powerful accountable for their actions, while the left demonizes the rich and powerful, but are reluctant to hold the poor accountable for their actions. I am not sure why, but this often tends to be the case when I read such books. <br /> <br />When Dyson mentions the fact that MLK, Louis Farrkhan, and Jesse Jackson made the same kinds of remarks that the Cos recently made (in fact, J/J fully agreed with the Cos, a fact that Dyson omits), he says it's okay since these guys also criticize the rich and powerful. So what does this say? If you're poor it's okay to smoke crack and engage in wanton behavior but it's wrong for rich, middle class and educated people? Like most on the far left, he thus patronizes the poor.  <br /> <br />I am no conservative myself (at least not politically), but WRONG is WRONG and poor education and poor opportunities are NOT EXCUSES for not living like DECENT HUMAN BEINGS as I personally know, have taught, and am related to TOO MANY poor people who try to raise their children with DIGNITY and DECENCY to buy such FOOLISHNESS! But if a rich person and educated person does wrong, than they are WRONG! If a poor and ignroant person does wrong, then they are also WRONG! Why can't we be honest about this? Are these guys trying to get brownie points and unearned praise of the people from telling some poor people what they want to hear? Would Dyson be so intellectually gentle if he were carjacked by a gangbanger (\\"since you're underprivileged, I'll let you have my car.\\") <br /> <br />Then to strike a few cheap shots, he also points to the Cos' recent personal problems to dismiss the king of Jello pudding as a hypocrite! First of all, a number of the accusations made against Cos have yet to be proven, as of this writing. This does not made anything he said less true any more than MLK's personal issues don't detract from the truth he spoke! <br /> <br />This book has some value as the research on Black classism is very interesting and he's obviously done some homework on this. But his thesis and conclusion do nothing to stem the tide of self-destruction in the ghettoes. In the final analysis, Cosby Si, Michael NO!   <br />	2005-06-12

This is a very uncomfortable subject for African-Americans and sympathetic whites, but it is a story that needs to be told. Admittedly, Larry Koger is heavy on graphs and the census, but it is important to show just who was involved in this business. Whenever an historian deals with subject matter as controversial as this, you need as much documentation as you can to prove your point. <br /> <br />Basically, the book shows slavery in its complexity that is often missing from books in films that are either by the political left OR right wing. We learn of William Ellison, a free black who eventually owned 63 slaves in Sumter County in 1860, whose sons actually tried to join the Confederatre Army! (they were rejected, for VERY obvious reasons)!  <br /> <br />There is also the tale of the traitor Peter Desverneys, infamous to us black history fans as the \\"man\\" who \\"spilled the beans\\" on the Denmark Vesey slave rebellion. We learn that Peter was not only freed for life after this, but bought and sold slaves of his own afterwards! <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but read the book and see for yourself. As A Black South Carolinian, I grew up hearing a number of African-Americans claim that some of their ancestors were actually slave owners (why they would brag about this could form another book about indentification with one's oppressors, but that's another story). In either case, it's a story you are not likely to hear about on a widespread basis, but it is important in understanding the length of the tragedy and delusion caused by the transatlantic slave trade.	2005-04-24

I was greatly inspired by the first edition of this while I was a college student in the 1980s (when Mr. Mandela was still imprisoned). <br /> <br />Among the highlights are \\"Bantu Education\\" (1950s), a look at how the educational system for Black South Africans was designed to produce a class of cheap labor (as a Black South Carolinian, I can relate). Mandela's court speech prior to his imprisonment in 1964 reads like a South African \\"I Have A Dream\\" as he eloquently states the case of Black S/Africans and his willingness to be a martyr for that cause. (Check the actual sound recording of this on the CD \\"The Voice of Nelson Mandela\\" for the full effect). <br /> <br />Later, we see the level of principle of Mr. Mandela as he spurns offers for freedom under the conditions set by the S/A government in the 80s. We also read his post-release speech as well as his calls for peace among warring factions in S/A.  <br /> <br />Makes you wish for eloquent, principled, and effective leaders like this in America. At least it can inspire future generations toward that direction. By all means, read it.	2005-04-04

Mr Horace Mungin (who I recently met at Charleston's Black Expo and thus purchased this book) more than ably fills the void with this collection.    He does a good job of articulation the view of a \\"silent majority\\" of African-Americans who know who they are and treasue all that is good in Black America, but despise such things as gangsterism and the low road that (much of) hip hop music has taken in depicting Black culture.    Here, he tackles such issues as homophobia, the Reagan administration, the deaths of racist leaders, the hip hop \\"culture,\\" police brutality, et. al. But there is an amazing set of vignettes early in this book where \\"Sleepy Willie\\"  tells of his refusal to return to Beaufort SC. It does a great job in expressing and articulating the bitterness of Black people who survived the Jim crow era in terms more poetic than polemical. He talks, and does not scream, thus even when you disagree with him, you still want to listen.    Mr. Mungin, keep writing. I hope this book becomes better known as it should be. Read it and you'll see what I mean.	2005-03-20

Josie was not originallly about a group of girl rockers, Alexandra was actually a witch (and NOT metaphorically speaking as she was in the TV show), Brother Alex was actually an egomaniac as opposed to his cowardly TV persona, etc.<br /><br />We have here the comic book evolution of the Josie concept and even how it eventually got to be a television show. We have here how Valerie joined the band and even Hanna-Barbera themselves (in cartoon form) welcoming the girls to their cartoon show (of course, nothing is mentioned here about Hanna-Barbera originally balking at including the African-American character of Valerie, a sad chapter in cartoon history that fortunately ended with them doing the right thing and welcoming Valerie aboard).<br /><br />Incidentally, the comic book stories, as evidenced in this collection, were usually more interesting than the cartoon tv series, which pretty much told the same story every time about \\"meddling kids\\" foiling the misdeeds of archvillans.<br /><br />But anyway, buy this and get some pretty cool cartoon history.	2005-03-18

It was in my classroom at Moultrie Middle School near Charleston SC in 1977 when I was in 7th grade and I read it frequently. It was a tough school filled with bullies at the time and this book brought me some needed relief. Basically, it's the somewhat comical adventures of a cartoon crime fighter who tries to protect the environment. Pretty amusing, as our man is often more well intentioned than successful. But near the end, the book takes a serious turn as our man closes by brooding about the fate of the planet. Worth a read for your kids and for you to have a discussion with them about when they're finished.<br /><br />If you like this, I would also recommed \\"Tom Eaton's Book of Marvels\\" that was also in my classroom at the time and that I enjoyed so much that I ordered it again 25 years later.

Books	5	6	6	N	N	The other side of the story	Since few people in respectable circles today would admit to having supported segregation, it is rare to read honest accounts from White southerners who admittely accepted the system and went along with it, as most did at the time. <br /> <br />This book is an interesting read for that reason. He speaks matter of factly about his own acceptance of the prejudices of his era and area, as he punches a black boy who uses his mouth on the same needle that he does to blow up a basketball without realizing why at the moment, although he is usually pleasant in hiis relations with the black customers who frequent his grandfather's general store in Wade, NC in the 1950s. <br /> <br />However, he comes across people who challenge everything he is led to believe about Blacks. There is the African-American schoolteacher who forces him to refer to her as \\"Miss\\" and most of all, his unlikely friend Street. Street is a self-educated free spirited intellectual who is amazingly accurate on biblical, astronomical, and constitutional facts who lives in a cave by himself. The local Whites dismiss him as crazy and eccentric, but Melton comes to see that Street is not only accurate in his facts, but represents the tragedy of racism through the inability of Street to make a living from his knowledge. One of the most interesting characters in all of Southern biography, one could easily picture Louis Gosset Jr. or James Earl Jones portraying Street in a film version of this book. <br /> <br />I would strongly recommend this for exposing young people in particular to a seldom-heard side in writings about the segregation era.	2005-02-26

He was at his prime as an orator during this time and the speeches read quite well. Those familiar with him after 1984 may be surprised to learn that he says very little about Jews at all in these selections. But here's what he DOES speak about.<br /><br />\\"The Black Woman\\" is a fascinating look at Black male-felame relationships. Feminists will not take well to what he says about the woman's nature being weak and naturally attarcted to strong men, and the women's movement, etc. But what he says about spousal abuse and basic decency in dealing with reations between the sexes is worth a listen. He skillfully mixes humor and ghetto \\"conventional wisdom\\" (or urban legends, if you will) to get his points across, as he does through most of the book.<br /><br />The \\"Rally for Angela Davis\\" and \\"Congress of African Peoples,\\" both of which essentially deal with black unity, continues along this vein of standup comedy mixed with ghetto conventional wisdom. His advice to the Black Panther Movement, people who encounter police brutality, and \\"leaders\\" who are all rhetoric and no constructive plan (\\"Eloquence is no substitute for a program\\") really bear reading today.<br /><br />One section, \\"Woe to the Hypocrites\\" is strictly for the hardocre followers of Elijah Muhammad. An interview on Bermudan television is quite revealing (he notes passingly and casually that Malcolm X was \\"punished\\" for going against Elijah Muhammad). This will send chills down the spine of those familiar with Malcolm's story.<br /><br />Overall, whether you like Farrakhan or not, this is an excellent look at where he was philosophically in the early 1970s before he was well known to mainstream audiences and captures him at his peak as a speaker. Written collections of speeches seldom do the speakers' justice or capture their skillful oratory on print, but this one certainly does.<br /><br />So whether you agree with him or not, read it if you can find it.ainly does.  <br /> <br />So whether you agree with him or not, read it if you can find it.	2005-02-21

Mostly taken from recordings during the 1980s when he burst upon the national scene in wake of the national discovery of his controversial remarks, it lets you know what he's all about.  <br /> <br />For the most part, the speeches are a mixture of hardcore Black nationalism, street philosophy, calls for self-improvement, but occasional doubletalk (note his defense of his more offbeat statements when a critic accuses him of a \\"kindergarten mentality\\") and (sadly) some hateful moments. You get the good mixed with the bad here folks. But in either case, it makes for interesting reading as the editors do a good job of capturing his speaking style on paper. Check out \\"How to Give Birth to a God\\" in particular. <br /> <br />Unfortuantely, his age and health problems have rendered Minister Farrakhan as a far less interesting speaker today, but get this and \\"Seven Speeches\\" to catch him in his prime and whether you agree with him or not, they make for interesting reading.	2005-02-21

Essentially, Bennett, a sympathetic white Ohioan, collected these tales from African-Americans in Charleston in the early 1900s, but since this was the dark days of segregation and he chose not to patronize the tellers of these tales and treated them with dignity, he and these stories were scorned by White Charleston's establishment until he published this book in 1943.<br /><br />Even without this basic history, these are wonderfully entertaining stories of ghosts, lost loves, and divine revenge that will be a hit at your next halloween party or your (older) children at bedtime.

She does an excellent job of articulating what it's like to be in that situation and people who could identify with this will find this aspect of the book almost theraputic. <br /> <br />The book is great with South Carolina history. She does a good job of detailing South Carolina's dark and racist past, and it's amazing to know that her bloodline contains some of the most infamous enemies to Black people that SC has ever known (Matthew C. Butler who led a masacre of 40 Blacks in Hamburg SC in 1876, William Thurmond, Strom's dad, who masterminded the career of the pro-lynching Senator Ben Tillman who also disfranchised and Jim-crowed Blacks in SC, etc. etc.). Strom Thurmond was Abraham Lincoln compared to these guys, and Mrs. Washington-Williams makes no apologies for these characters. <br /> <br />Having met Strom once in 1991 myself, I can attest to what she says about Strom Thurmond's two-sidedness in his relationship with African-Americans. An uncle of mine worked for him, and even Blacks who (rightfully) detested him as I did found him strangely likeable and charming in person. But while she finds it difficult to express her ambivalence about their relationship and his refusal to publicly acknowledge her in spite fo his personal kindness, she learns not to hold back on her disgust of his public statements and policies toward African-Americans. He seemed genuinely shocked to hear his daughter say \\"Black people HATE you, Senator!\\" as if he was not accustomed to having blacks speak to him with such frankness.   <br /> <br />There is one moment that I had to question in this book. As a South Carolina historian, I read with amusement as she described seeing the Confederate Flag flying above the State House in Columbia in 1941. Fack is folks, that flag was not put up there until 1962. But that's a minor detail. <br /> <br />In either case, the concluding chapter in which she sums up her views about her heritage and race relations will sound like anathema to some and will be cheered by others. Even if you disagree with her on some points, she clearly explains in her story how she come to such conclusions. <br /> <br />So for an important document on a seldom-discussed aspect of some of the most hypocritical factors of the Jim Crow era and as an articulation of the pain that could be caused by out of wedlock births to fathers whose emotional support is lacking, I speak with pride of Mrs. Washington Williams as my fellow South Carolinian, fellow American, and fellow human being.  <br /> <br />If she's ever in Charleston, I'll be sure to get my copy autographed.	2005-01-27

So it can rightly be called \\"A Malcolm X Reader\\" or \\"The Evolution of Malcolm X Thought.\\"    He also mentions Nelson Mandela in passing in this collection, and what he has to say about his days in the Nation of Islam near the end of this book will give fans of the pre-1964 thought of M/X much pause.

WHAT African-American who travels in diverse circles does NOT do this?) but yet derides the ignorant actions of some Black \\"celebrities\\" as \\"Negronian.\\" (As if this behavior was mutually exclusive to Black people. Is this self-hating or what?). In the reprint of the pitiful Whitney Houston interview, she tells Whitney she \\"loves\\" her but is clearly delighting in the pathetic, substanbce-induced ramblings. <br /> <br />Then of course, we have \\"treated\\" to reprints of the sickening call-in segments of her show in where ignorant young girls call in with their incredibly stupid stories of the dumb choices they make in repationships. Wendy is clearly taking sadistic glee in all this. Our \\"heroine\\" then rants on about her hatred of R. Kelly and her disgust of the infamous video of his alleged illiegal sex acts, but if she is so disgusted by this, why did she watch the whole video and give a complete description of what apepars! <br /> <br />You have to wonder if this high priestess of moral virtue will let her children read her books or listen to her show. If they do, how will she defend it? <br /> <br />Fortunately, I got this from the library and did not throw away any hard earned cash for this mess. If you must read it, do the same! But if you made the mistake of spending money on this trash, I would suggest that it would come in handy if your fireplace is low on wood and if run out of Charmin. <br /> <br />Oh well. At least Barack Obama's book shows that the current genenration of African-Americans has SOME people who write decent books.	2005-01-11

When I was 12 years old (Summer of 1977), I checked this book from my neighborhood library and was enthralled with the wonderful stories of the Old West (Pecos Bill, Johnny Appleseed, Jesse James, etc.) Ghost tales (The Singing Bones, Mark Twain's classic \\"Golden Arm,\\" Raw Head and Bloody Bones), African-American Lore (Zora Neale Hurston's stories and the Brer Rabbit Tales) etc. etc. <br /> <br />I wound up memorizing these stories and telling them to the neighborhood kids. That made me quite popular that summer.  <br /> <br />Years later, I would tell stories not only to the children in my family but also to schools, churches, nightclubs and other assemblies. I would also write articles on folklore as well as a book of my father's stories. <br /> <br />Recently, I went back to this source and bought my own copy. Just as good as I remember it, with lots of historical background to the over 500 stories and songs that B.A. Botkin lovingly preserved. <br /> <br />I for one am thankful that he did this. Anyone who loves to tell and listen to a good story (which is sadly becoming a lost art) would do well to buy this wonderful book. HOWEVER, parents should be warned that it's not really a kid's book. This book was complied in the less PC days of 1944, so it contains some insensitive language. That aside, go for it. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-01-11

We also get some rather pointed, but not mean-spirited criticism of the rhetoric oriented politics of Black nationalism of the 1990s and of Min. Louis Farrakhan and his followers in particular. Fortunately, Mr. Obama offers some constructive alternative solutions along with his constructive cirticism of this phenomenon. <br /> <br />The current edition of this book closes with the 2004 Democratic Convention Speech that is Mr. Obama's current claim to fame. Aside from a few dated references to the John Kerry campaign and the red state/blue state controversy, future readers should also be inspired by this work that appeals to unity and not division, unlike so much of the political rhetoric of recent times. <br /> <br />Overall, a great piece of work from a voice that many people hope to hear more from in the future. <br /> <br />	2004-12-20

A short family bio of her life include removable items such as facsimilies of her letters and actual writings (including surviving notes from her lost book on Herod the Great). But the real gem here is the CD. Zora speaks in a 1943 radio interview and her down-home folksy speaking style truly compliments the stories she tells (especially about her being a \\"fat little baby\\"). Then we have a 1939 recording of her singing some Florida folksongs that would have probably been lost had this not been recorded. A most fascinating listen. <br /> <br />Just waiting now for a documentary with some of the films she made in the 20s, 30s, and 40s while recording folklore.

It takes Mr. Laurence Tero from his days in the Chicago ghetto to bodyguarding the heavyweight CHUMP Leon Spinks and to his rise to fame. Very entertainming and occasionally inspiring. Occasional stories (such as the tale of his brothers tracking down a man who commmitted a crime against their mother) read like streetcorner tall tales. His stories of the chump/champ Leon Spinks (the Mike Tyson of the seventies) are downright hilarious if not flattering at all to Spinks. But his Bill Cosby-type sermon to ghetto youth at the end of this book will make you wanna give an A-MEN and make you wanna put some cash in the collection plate, which makes you feel good about buying this book.<br /><br />Since Mr. T. has been consistant about practicing the message that he preaches in this book, you feel good about reading it.	2004-10-21

This is an accurate description. Most of this stuff is not that funny or particularly erotic. In fact, it gets dull pretty fast. The cartoons with Amos & Andy, Laurel & Hardy, Hitler, and Mahatma Gandhi (that one must be seen to be believed), and a minstrel-like Joe Louis are interesting largely for historical reasons. But the takeoffs (no pun intended) on Betty Boop, Lil Abner, Popeye, etc. are surprisingly flat, considering the unexplored comic possibilities (though the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck segment is good for a few laughs). Be warned though, some of this stuff (especially in the last chapter) is really gross even by modern standards, so proceed with caution. Overall, it's more of a curiousity piece more than anything else.	2004-07-18

The first speech at the 1964 democratic convention has a poor audio quality and RFK takes a while to get warmed up before we hear the famous Shakepearean ode to his recently deceased brother JFK. Some editing would have helped that one. Then we hear RFK give a heartfelt, but sincere speech on the need for young people to repudiate bigotry at Ole Miss in 1966. Still pretty relevant. The 1967 speech on ghetto conditions shows amazing insight for a White man who was born rich.<br />But the tour de force here is the improvised speech to Black Indianapolis residents upon the assassination of Martin Luther King. I've heard excerpts of this before, but to hear it in what appears to be its entirety is extremely moving and one of the best recorded speeches I've ever heard aside from MLK himself and Nelson Mandela's CD. To hear how RFK was able to speak so sincerely and hopefully on such a tragic occasion will really make you beleive in the nest of human nature and that alone is worht the price of admission.<br />Next we hear a more measured and formal speech on the aftermath of the King killing recorded a day later. Still worht a listen about the futility of violence, all the more ironic considering that RFK himself would soon become the victim of such violence.<br />I've read books that complied RFK's speeches, but that does not match actually hearing them. Do youself a favor and get this. Now all that needs to be done is to release a DVD of the 1988 documetnary RFK in His Own Words.	2004-07-01

This was a chain letter written in 1993 that pretended to be some document from 1712 which supposeldly told the &quot;strategy&quot; to keep Blacks divided. For some strange reason, many African-Americans  jumped on this like white on rice and beleived it to be historical fact. The truth is that is was largely &quot;taken&quot; form a passage in Anatoli Vingradov's 1935 fictional novel &quot;The Black Counsul&quot; regarding Napoleon's (fictional) plans on keeping the Haitians divided during the Hatian revolution. Fact is, the language of the letter IS NOT that of the 1700s, plus a lot of issues with historical accuracy make it plain to those of us who make history our profession see that this is nothing but BUNK!<br />When Farrakhan (who admits in his biography by Arthur Madiga that he is no scholar or historian) spouted this biz at the Million Man March, a lot of people somehow beleived that they had found the root of all the problems of the Black race.

A favorite of mine that is in this book is the tale of Charlie Brown's adventures at camp, as well as where Lucy bamboozles CB into giving up his chance for a free movie for her. Schulz' talent for understated satire is shown during the 1968 strip that introduces the Black child Franklin to the proceedings (this actually received hate mail that Schulz wisely ignored). The issue of integration is handled deftly when Snoopy (as the Red Baron) says upon seeing Franklin for  the first time, \\"Headquarters must be planning a big drive-I don't recognize a lot fo these new men.\\"<br />This book is aptly titled.

Much of it is a rather grim look of the society Blacks in SC faced and their difficulty in finding workable solutions to their problems until about 1944, when they fought to regain the right to vote. Newby makes good use of the sources that were available to him at the time, such as a scattering of Black newspapers, and from White newspapers such as the Columbia State and the Charleston News and Courier. From this we get a lot of insight into events forgotten to history such as the Lake City and Phoenix massacres and the &quot;indignation meetings&quot; that Sc Blacks held to protest their plight. Today, Black repositories such as the Avery Center in Charleston and other collections such as the Caroliniana Library of Columbia have better collections of primary sources for current scholars of this subject, but Newby's book is a good start.	2004-05-24

Overall, Miss Parker hits some accurate points about poor Americans accepting perosnl responsibility for their actions and the drawbacks of the welfare system. Having taught the children of (and being related to) many of the &quot;lazy poor&quot; that she talks about, I know firsthand that this is not merely conservative propaganda. I also agree on what she says about most of the so-called Black leaders, having been involved with community activism myself.<br />However, this book has some flaws. The statistics she uses to prove her points are interesting, but the listing of sources would help buttress her argument. Secondly, while I personally beleive in God myself, I have to disagree with her idea of fundamentalist Christianity being a major cure-all for victims of  the culture of poverty. That works for SOME people, but it doesn't work for eveybody's mindset-besides, it may send the struggling poor directly into the trap of the false storefront prophets who are already a plague on the ghettoes.<br />While there is much to disagree with in this book, it DOES contain enough truth about the problems about the underclass to make it a valuable document.	2004-04-27

Overall, I can see both sides with this siiue, having read the book over the past few days.<br />In displaying the examples of Boondockery from the first naional strip in 1999 (Riley, we're not in Chicago anymore) to the post 9-11 slams at the current wartime culture, Aaron McGruder shows the reader how the focus of the strip has shifted and lets us make up our minds. Even he admits in the intro that he was getting tired of the character based strips on Jazmine (who I miss, she was sweet), the Star Wars Guy, etc. and felt the necessity of speaking out during the Bush era and on things he felt were detrimental to African-American culture. McGruder can really be shrill and self-righteous against people he disagrees with, but this is typical of satirists.<br />There is enough real-life fodder for all this, and this book will certainly stand as a good time capsule of American life in the early millennium. The problem is that in the future, the humor in this book (especially the constant hip-hop inside gags such as the title of this book, which is from a Public Enemy lyric) will be about as funny as Lenny Bruce, Jack Parr, the Smothers Brothers, Bloom County, and Lil Abner are today.<br />&quot;Deceased Brooklyn Rapper with Big swollen Belly/Any Karate flick starring Jim Kelly?&quot; Hey, you have to give SOME stars to people who write lines like this.	2004-04-27

The problem is that the authors' biases and agreements with some of the anti-Black ideas of colonization and deporation are all too clear. Near the end of the book, the authors rant against John F. Kennedy's support for civil rights deomstrations (i.e., JFK's speech on June 11, 1963 on the subject) and the \\"forced\\" integration of \\"ignorant and unqualified Negroes\\" in colleges and neighborhoods. <br />Since this book was written in 1970, the authors could not have forseen the likes of Condoleeza Rice, Oprah Winfrey, Gen. Colin Powell, et. al. (although they damn with faint praise Bill Cosby  and Sidney Poitier in their critique of the \\"overrepresentaion of Negroes as saintly beings on television\\"). Additionaly, nothing good is said about the performance of Black politicians during reconstruction (forgetting that these guys started the public school systems in the South and some proved to be able statesmen and orators like Robert Smalls).<br />These kinds of outdated biases really hurts this book, Read with a careful eye.	2004-04-21

Basically, the authors run down the history of each religion it mentions (with all objectivity thrown out the window) as a false cult (although they show some sympathy with the Seventh day Adventists). They dismiss anyhting that does not subscribe to literal Biblical teachings as heretical. Each point about the other religions is dissected, while challenges to fundamentalist Christianity are dismissed as childish or evil.<br />Basically, it is this kind of intolerant attituide that makes religion so problemitc today and it shows how many Christian fundamentalists are not that far removed from their current Islamic counterparts in the Taliban. I would agree that some religions are indeed more filled with nonsense than others, but those who try to push the hardcore literalist view of Biblical Christianity do not have much of a leg to stand on. While I personally beleive that God exists, any honest historian will tell you that religions and dogmas are man made and ALL are filled with at least some error.<br />Nah, while giving some interesting history into the other religions, this is a narrow-minded rant by people who obviously know better and are in bad need of Milk of magnesia.	2004-03-30

This clearly provess that she beleives that racism is still a major problem. (We cannot deny that it is). <br />The problem is that in the second half, she notices the pathological reaction of Blacks to this (which mostly rings true, although the section on Uncle Toms stretches things a bit ) and all but tells people to &quot;get over it.&quot; Easier said than done. The &quot;Ghetto jokes &quot; at the end of the book are ones I've seen on e-mail myself, and the section on low Black self-esteem is on solid ground.<br />But it seems to me that what she said in Part #1` would make it clear to anyone why the behaviors in part 2 exist.	2004-03-30

Basically, it is the ravings of another self-proclaimed prophet named Athlyi (middle name of the author) who goes on and on about how God supposedly appointed him to start this thing called the Athlyican Church beased on what would now be called Afrocentric teachings. He claims that he appointed Garvey as an apostle, but Garvey himself openly denounced such would-be afrocentric messiahs in 1927, 1934, and 1936 (see the volumes of the Marcus Garvey papers for these years). Almost every other sentance (like the comparative &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;) begins with &quot;And it came to pass...&quot; Pretty tiresome stuff after awhile.<br />One can understand the need for the more downtrodden people of the African diaspora for  these kinds of teachings for a badly needed improvement of self-esteem. But the fact is that there is enough REAL and verifiable Black history out there (along with the actual writings of Marcus Garvey) that things like this are really not necessary. Interesting only for historical and sociological reasons.	2004-03-25

Spencie Love performs a well-needed service by debunking one of the most common (albeit one of the more plausible) of these myths-the idea that Black blood plasma pioneer Dr. Charles Drew bled to death because he was refused admission to a segregated hospital. Fact was, as she carefully demonstrates, this actually happened to another Black person named Maltheus Avery around the same time while Dr. Drew was treated responsibly at the time of this death.<br />As a Black scholar, I have long decried the use of fabrication in the telling of Black history as something a people starved for true knowledge could ill-afford.

For some strange reason, people still believe that whacked-out piece of trash known as &quot;the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot; is a factual document. For those who don't know, that is the mother of conspiracy theroies of how the Jews supposedly plan to rule the world written during the Russian pogroms of Jews in he early 1900s by Sergei Nilus.<br />Anyway, this book is an attempt to decontruct bit by bit the lunacy in which this book spouts by refuting it chapter by chapter. Unfortuantely, this may not convince core beleivers of the &quot;Protocols&quot; slop, as it comes off as very defensive.<br />However, the author wisely includes the Protocols in its entirety so that readers could see it for the bad science fiction that it actually reads like it is.Outrageous statements as &quot;We are despots&quot; and &quot;We will use treachery and deceit,&quot; ad nauseum are extremely difficult to take seriously. So in that aspect, this book does a good service in letting the reader slog through this garbage so that the intelligent readers see the Protocols for the hog slop that it is instead of having it filtered to them by zealots.	2004-03-10

Obviously, growing up under Jim Crow heavily scarred him and he like others of his generation have tried numerous ways, most of them fruitless, to deal with their pain and bitterness. While I do not enjoy reading or listening to such tirades, I understrand the source of whence they came.<br />That said, some of what he says here is accurate in regard to history and recent events, but much of this is grossly one-sided, as if everywhere outside of Europe was a paradise prior to 1492 and all other humans lived in purity. Fact is, the world in general was not that perfect then-or now. Also, much of this reads like a bitter and unfocused rant instead of a percise study of the problems of today's America.<br />Many people in the 1960s were understandably fed up with what was happening in America. No one can blame them for that then, but they soon found out that these problems would not be solved by chasing rainbows elsewhere (See MLK's speech in Detroit, June 23, 1963). If Mr. Robinson feels that he found utopia in St. Kitts, more power to him. But when he realizes that there is no complete heaven on earth, he may be in for further heartbreak.	2004-03-09

Good stuff as a whole, the only book you'll ever really need on the Rascals. You may disagree with some reviews and some of your favorite rascals films might get trahsed (in my case-Shiver My Timbers). But it does introduce you to the world of the Silent Our Gangs and it's safe to say this book may have created the market that exists for the Silent Gang films that are out on VHS and DVD. In either case-get the book and you'll see what I mean. An addendum may be needed since quite a few of the lost Silent Gang films have surfaced since the 1992 updating of this book (especially Hal Roach's favorite &quot;Your Own Back yard&quot; and the very first Our Gang film from 1922).	2004-01-21

When this book came out in 1965, the NAACP's magazine &quot;The Crisis&quot; and other middle-class blacks criticized this book because it's raw and unsentimental portrait of ghetto life was seen as threatening to the entry of Black Americans into mainstream positions in America at the time. Too bad so many people tuned out it's message. Many of the things Claude Brown spoke of in this book about the Harlem of the mid-20th century came to pass in far more communities than Harlem (massive drug addiction, lunatic Black nationalist cults, massive disrespect of women, mindless violece, etc). Had more people listened to Claude Brown (RIP) at the time, perhaps Black America may have united to  rid our communities of these evils instead of irrelevant &quot;issues&quot; like the Confederate Flag so that these things would not have become the plauge that they are today.

Unfortuanately, this book doesn't give quite the same effect by and large. He first writes here about his life, and then he goes into his politix. Aside from the moving chapter on the death of his brother, his writing style is not quite as engaging as his speaking style. Kinda stiff actually. But near the very end, he gets into the rip-roaring style of his stump oratory and speaks of the errors of the current leadership and challenges the Anerican people to unite and take our country back. Perhaps Gov. Dean would do better by preparing a brief section on his life and making way for some of his classic stump speeches (as opposed to the brief excerpts used in &quot;Howard Dean in His Own Words&quot;). Perhaps Gov. Dean will do just that in the near future. If not, I hope he reads this and gets the idea.	2003-12-02

The idea of BOND as a program to keep another generation of young African-Americans from falling by the wayside is good and valid. <br />Now on to the topic of the rotten &quot;leadership&quot; in Black America. For the most part he's right. But too much time is spent on this and it becomes redundant. For instance, VERY few people take Al Sharpton seriously at all to qualify him as a &quot;leader.&quot; Minister Louis Farrakhan's age and health problems pretty much makes him a figure of the past these days, and Maxine Waters is not that well-known outside of Los Angeles. As for the Reparations bit, the poorly attended &quot;Reperations march&quot; that took place in August 2002 revealed that to be the collection of crackpots that this movement actually consists of (even Jesse Jackson himself has admitted in a newspaper column that the 14th Amendment sec. 4 makes this issue a moot point).<br />As for Jackson and the NAACP, much of what he says is valid, although I am aware that they both still do some good from time to time. I also disagree with Rev. Peterson referring to Nelson Mandela as a communist when Mandela himself has admitted in his Rivona trial speech and other writings that while he may have cooperated with such people, he was never a member of the party or a full subscriber to Marx's teachings.<br />Basically, instead of wasting time with antics by &quot;shooting fish in a barrel&quot; in boycotting the NAACP, Jesse Jackson, and the Reparations movement, Rev. Peterson would do well to build up the good that BOND does and he would receive more support for such a worthy cause.<br />PS-The quote from Booker T. Washington about &quot;leaders&quot; who do not wish to see solutions so that they could stay on business was dead on target.	2003-11-29

I was impressed with his speech and asked if he had any books that collected his ideas. He mentioned this and &quot;Winning Back America,&quot; and both had not yet been released at the time. I told him I'd look forward to reading them.<br />Essentially, this is just that. A collection of his ideas in quotes of varying lengths of varying issues of the day. Those who have heard Dean speak in person or who have heard him unedited on C-Span will recognize much of this as standards in Gov. Dean's speeches.<br />A few of Gov. Dean's best lines (&quot;I'd rather be right and lose than wrong and win&quot;) are not present here, but enough of his standards are here to give you a good idea of what he's about-a man of ideas who bases his beliefs on his feelings and experiences as opposed to any political dogma.<br />In this book, Gov. Dean says that his major political influences were Jimmy Carter and Harry Truman. Judging from the times I've heard him in person and from this book, I would put him closer to Bobby Kennedy and Wendell Willkie as I think his ideas have more in common with the latter two.<br />In either case, it's a good basic way to make up your mind about how you feel about Gov.

Willkie went and interviewed both leaders and common people in China, Russia, Iraq (!), and several other countries. The result was this book in 1943. It makes for good reading since Willkie was the type of intellectual who still spoke in the language of the common people.<br />Willkie was a man ahead of his time. He warned the US against postwar policies of International imperialism was well as isolationalism. He cautioned the West against judging nonwestern nations by what would now be considered &quot;ethnocentric standards.&quot; He also warned Americans that the best way to appeal to nonwhite colonialized nations abroad was to treat its nonwhites better at home, as well for as the foundation of what would become the United Nations.<br />Small wonder that the Republican party vetoed Willkie as a candidate in 1944 (these ideas would have been too hot to handle even for the democrats at that time). To make matters worse, Willkie's poor health habits led to an early death in 1944.<br />This book, while it's now a historical document, is an interesting and perceptive look at America's internal and external realtions. Current leaders would do well to read it. For more of Willkie's forward ideas, search the web to find &quot;An American Program,&quot; which was published the day before his untimely death.

One reviewer for Elijah's equally whacked out &quot;Message to the Blackman&quot; (the source of much of this material) noted that the people who gravitated to this that he knew were usually social losers. My experience has been the same. It is true that &quot;for every action there is a reaction&quot; and that it was inevitable that the mistreatment of Blacks in America would produce violent flipsides to Martin Luther King. But hateful teachings of this kind does nothing but compound the problem and attracts ignorant lowlifes with violent tendencies (learn how and why Malcolm X was killed for example).  <br />Fortuantely, few people today listen to this mess and it will linger in the historical scrap heap where it belongs as society makes progress in such matters.	2003-11-25

Being an Afrcan-American himself. Dr. Turner won the confidence of Sea Island Gullah speakers in the 1930s and won their confidence in providing a window to their lives and folkways. The result was this book, which was probably the first that did not patronize Gullah speakers as being backward and ignorant as some (sadly) still do today.<br />The central section of this book, which deals with linguistic similarities between West Africans and Gullah speakers, is primarily for linguists. But the chapters on Dr. Turner's acquaintance with the Gullah speakers anmd his collection of their tales of slavery, religion, and life expereinces make for interesting reading for the layman. Overall, a great window into a subject that had long suffered from mockery and ridicule. It shows the Gullah speakers in their pride and dignity.	2003-11-22

Stokely Carmichael/Toure was a person you either loved or hated, no in-between, but he was indeed an important person of the Civil Rights era. E. Michael Thelwell, who edited this book, sat down extensively with the Stoke before his death to preserve his memoirs. The Stoke that appears here is not quite the wild man often quoted in the sixties. The rhetoric about \\"honkies,\\" crude sexism, and xenophobia of some of his old speeches are absent here. Stoke clarifies his stands as being more of a socilaist humanitairan (as well as still being a Pan-Africanist), but he does not acknowledge many of his errors of that time. Some readers will have a problem with Thelwells' constant injections, which explain some of the names, people, and events that the Stoke talks about to those not familiar with the sixties. This may help some readers and annoy others, but it may be necessary since the generation who knew such things firsthand will soon be gone.

It was written after the fall of the Songhay Empire in the 1600s about the kings and events leading up to that event, and no English translations have been available until now, thanks to Dr. John O. Hunwick of Northwestern University.<br />The result is an interesting narrative with a cast of characters that include some familiar names to African history fans such as Mansa Musa, Sunni Ali (referred to in this book as &quot;the tyrant&quot;), Askia Muhammad, and the scholar Ahmed Baba, as well as many more obscure historical figues and events. (Surprisingly, Sundiata the original Lion King is only mentioned in passing in a footnote).<br />However, the casual reader with a beginning knowledge of Ancient Africna history should be warned that this is not for beginners or lay historians. Dr. Hunwick, in a noble effort to make this understandable, fills the text with footnotes and phonetic pronunciation of the Islamic names and concepts. Plus, the original language of the text is quite labored for the casual reader and while Dr. Hunwick tries with this, it's still a pretty rough read for the beginner.<br />For the avid African historian, this is great stuff which is filled new and important information. The layman may want to start with such things as the recent translation of Ibn Battuta's accounts of his travels in precolonial Africa or D.T. Niane's account of the Sundiata epic (as well as reading the Quaran) to get a feel for this kind of material before moving on to this. Also, it is important to know that the Islamic writers of that era (Middle Ages) were very ethnocentic and scornful of pre-Islamic African cultures, so be prepared for that kind of bias.<br />But with all that said, go for it. It's an extremely valuable piece of history.	2003-10-27

For one thing, Stromberg only uses one panel from each of the comics he discusses, thus the reader has a difficult time getting these particular comics in full context (although his accompanying notes are good). This and (as Charles Johnson noted in his prologue), the &quot;Negro Comics&quot; of Black newspapers of the 1900s are given somewhat short shrift as a means of comparison. Cartoons dealing with the portrayal of Africans as simian-like savages are used so frequently that the point that this stereotype was common among cartoonists is beaten to the ground.<br />These flaws aside, it's a good introduction to the subject of Black protrayals in the cartoons. Aaron McGruder (of &quot;Boondocks&quot; fame) wrote his college thesis on this subject, cartoonist Tim Jackson has a website on vintage Black cartoons, and B. Keith Murphy who is a professor at Ft.

In fact, that particular routine and Martin Lawrence's ridiculous tirades in the film \\"Boomerang\\" were spoofs loosely based on this book.<br />In the 1990s, the horrible conditions and confusion in Black America led to a cottage industry of this kind of loony literature that was long on crude propaganda that attracted bitter pseudo-intellectuals but was short on sources and scholarship.

Pretty good stuff here with excellent storytelling. What's really fascinating is the former slave of Georgia Sen. J.H. Hill (whose name is not given) and his recollection of the Atlanta Riot of 1906 as well as slavery. That's the beauty of this series. These accounts give you a lot of well-told firsthand information that the history books missed. BTW-This is a tad thicker than other volumes of the series.	2003-07-26

Miss Hurmence has truly picked the best of the bunch of the North Carolina Narratives to use in this book. For one thing, there is a wide range here. We run the gamut here from slaves who cried when freedom came, such as the young lady who wished to stay with her master in a comfortable house than the shack where her mother lived. And we get Thomas Hall, who unrepentantly rebukes Lincoln, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and the interviewer to his face (Malcolm X would have loved him). This collection proves that as foul as it was/is to own another human being, the reality of American slavery was far more complex than we can understand. Plus, they make for good reading. Hopefully, this will encourage more people to read the uncensored WPA Narratives at the Library of Congress' website.	2003-07-26

I met Randall Kennedy at the college where I teach last year and made it clear to him what I thought of that book. But I like this one. For one thing, it has a lot of rare and little known history such as the sad tale of Black Reactionary George Schuyler and his racially confused daughter, the young lady who was prevented from being adopted in Jim Crow Louisiana due to confusion over her race, and the angry racially-mixed young man who grew up to be a Black Panther. These and numerous other stories are excellently told and are quite informative, as well as facts and figures on interracial marriages and adioption that may surprise street-corner dogmatists on this issue.<br />This book made me view Dr. Kennedy in a new light. Although I still despise his last book, I will merely agree to disagree with him on that one. I think he is sincerely trying to clear up the confusion that abounds over race in this country on both sides (as he makes clear in the afterword) because he actually has hope that this can be done. The sad thing is that many such people WANT to stay confused to provide an outlet for their personal frustrations and are not likely to read this book. As I have said about John McWhorter, I don't agree with all he says, but since he is not of the Ken Hamblin/George Schuyler reactionary school, we have enough common ground as to where I would be happy to speak to him again.	2003-07-20

Here we get info on a long-forgotten lynching that tookplace in Nashville in 1892 and an early look at life at Fisk University. What makes these stand apart from the others is the fact that since Black Students from Fisk University interviewed these ex-slaves in 1929-30 (not to be confused with the later WPA Slave narratives), they felt freer to express themselves than they would have with White interviewers at the time. We get an eyeful to read as a result and a vairutally untarnished view. However, many of these are anonymous since some of the ex-slaves feared retributution for their remarks. All in all, an excellent read and a treasure chest for historians. <br />There was another book that was written in 1968 from the Fisk University Slave narratives called &quot;Unwritten History of Slavery&quot; that contains some of the same material. Interesting to compare the two.	2003-07-10

This book could have been a whole lot better. While the current editor did a good job of making the SC African-American dialect more accessible to lay readers (even she admits to having trouble with printed versions of this dialect), many of the better stories were either highly edited or left out, such as Elijah Green's Reconstruction Narrative that was heavily edited and Isreal Nesbitt's recollections of the Vesey Rebellion, which aren't included.<br />However, to the layman and non-historian, this is a good start in understanding slavery from the sources. Some interesting stories do remain, such as the Union County narrative about the Ku Klux Klan. So it's good for starters. The Tennessee and Georgia anthologies in this series are better, though.	2003-07-04

This book continues Sharazad Ali's sad tradition of whacked out, mean spirited pseudoscience and pseudohistory that appeals only to extremely bitter and half educated African-American social rejects looking for an outlet for their misdirected anger.<br />Essentially, the book is a series of quizzes that imply that any Black American who has any positive encounter with Whites are still slaves. One particularly outrageous Q&amp;A states that any Black person who laughes at a White man's joke is still a slave (so does this mean that I belong in the cotton patch for laughing at Jakcie Gleason and the Honeymooners)?<br />A good subtitle of this book (as well as Sharazad's other epics of nonsense) should be &quot;The Miseducation of a Negro&quot; (with apologies to Carter G.

On one hand, many people of our generation are somewhat annoyed by the tendency of Blacks who were born before 1960 to view everything with a racial angle as if we were still fleeing lynchers and Jim Crowists on a constant basis. So to a point, some of this is refreshing. However, I also feel that  McWhorter should show some understanding of the effects the Jim Crow  era had on that generation and see why they feel the way they do. I've always taken that into consideration when suffering through bitter tirades from people who grew up with segregation. (Read Ishmael Reed's latest &quot;Along The Front Lines&quot; for an example).<br />However, I like the fact that McWhorter makes it clear that he cannot be pigeonholed as a &quot;Black Conservative&quot; or a &quot;Black Republican&quot; and that his views result from his own readings and personal expreiences, not anyone's recycled dogma. I can respect this even when I don't agree and I'd love to chat with him sometime. By that same token, I also feel that had McWhorter grown up in the deep South or in a more low-income background, he may sing a different tune about race relations. I don't think things are as bad as the gloom-and doomists make it out to be, but I don't think it's quite as rosy on the whole as McWhorter sees in his immediate surroundings.<br />In either case, I hope he keeps writing. It's certainly different than the norm and not along the party lines of the likes of Ken Hamblin, and it is overall a good source of discussion and dialogue.	2003-05-27

If you are one of those who dismiss it as a crackpot scheme to serve as an outlet for bitter people, it will at least enlighten you to their points of view.<br />The pro-reparations arguments vary. Some are rather scholarly indeed, especially the one that talks about the Ex-slave pension movement of the 19th century. That was very enlightening. The inevitable comparisons to the repaprations for German Jews and Japansese Americans appear. Others are from those who are from the extreme Black nationalist camp and filled with rhetoric (sadly, the completely ahistorical \\"Willie Lynch\\" letter is once again cited as fact when it has been proven to be an urban legend) and another wishes to dismiss all Black Americans who do not consider themselves solely as \\"Africans.\\"<br />The sad part of it is that some of this rhetoric confirms this issue (at least to those who remain unconvinced) to be a product of the extremist camp of fanatics and unreconstructed sixties radicals, as was the case with the failed reparations march in 2002 which alienated people with crackpot speeches and a low turnout. In fact, little has been heard form the Reparations movement on a wide level since that fiasco.<br />The editors do a good service by printing a collection of relevant doccuments, such as General Howard's 1865 Field Order and Thaddues Stevens \\"40 Acres and a Mule\\" proposal (both of which were turned down by the reconstruction government, I might add, and NEITHER mentioned anything about money to former slaves). Section 4 of the 14th Amendment also ruled out any financial compensation for slavery, yet nowhere in this book does anyone comment on this fact.<br />The editor has explained why so few of those who consider all of this a waste of time are featured (glad that he made this clear). But this does add some balance and counterarguments for discussion.<br />However, while this is an enlightening collection and good for debate, but Idon't think it'll change anyone's mind on the issue.	2003-05-14

There is really no reason why it should be controversial.<br />Sure, there are those of the fundamentalist/evangelical view who have been taught that to even look at something like this will make one hellbound, but that's malarkey in my opinion. Many of these stories actually make for good reading. <br />The Adam and Eve tale is fascinating excercise in religious fiction which proports to explain where cain got his wife, what happened to Adam and Eve after they left the Garden of Eden, etc. The Infancy Gospel is a bizzare tale of a wayward young Jesus before he learned to use his powers wisely. The letter of Pilate gives the Roman leader's feelings after the crucifixion, etc. Among the best is the Story of Ahikar, which is somewhat of an ancient Hebrew mix of the Arabian Nights and Aesop's Fables. The Secrets of Enoch (not to be confused with the Book of Enoch) tells of Enoch's adventures in heaven.<br />As long as this book is taken for what it actually is, which is a collection of entertaining ancient &quot;what if&quot; stories and nothing more, no one should have any problem with it.

As one who went to intergrated schools in the 1970s, I find some of what Wolters writes about undeniable. Yes there were many riots and yes not all Black kids were the innocent heroes often portayed in TV-movies of this era. But to completely dismiss school integration as a failure is asinine. Those of us who have experienced this era must also admit that in spite of the problems we had during this period, positive results such as lasting frinedship and better understanding among the races DID happen frequently (&quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; anyone?).<br />If Wolters and others would like to go back to the days of seperate and unequal de jure schools and when fear prevented interracial friendships, they are welcome to take a trip on a one-way time machine backward.

Secondly, although this book is about a prominent member of the Bahai Faith and the author (whom I met recently) is a Bahai, the book benefits by being objective about the Bahai Faith as it does not propagandize, but matter-of-factly discusses some of the internal problems within the faith during Mr. Gregory's lifetime. So it's a good read as you see Mr. Gregory's efforts to preach a good message of unity to a country and world that had (and still has) a way to go in accepting. People who are objective about religion will be inspired by Mr. Gregory's story through Ms. Morrison's telling.	2003-02-14

That aside, White's description of the NOI (an organization which, as a believer in the brotherhood of humanity, I personally have little regard for), makes it clear that little has changed in this organization since Malcolm X (wisely) left it in the 1960s in regards to it's exploitation of angry, confused, and disfranchised Blacks.

It's a pretty good documentation of the early days of rap and Run-DMC's often overlooked role in literally bringing rap back from the dead, gaining fame as they did during an early low point in the genre in 1983. For those of us who were around during that period, this book will bring back good memories. For others, it's a good education.	2002-12-09

Some of the posters have gone into the history of these tales, so no need to repeat that here. However, these tales are best taken in small doses, as Chandler's \\"Negro dialect\\" (as it was known at the time) is a bit much on the eyes of the modern reader (I'm an African-American from South Carolina myself and I had a lot of trouble trying to decipher some of this). But the illustrations are quite fitting and wonderful. So if you have a lot of patience and love some good stories, go for it. HOWEVER, I should add that Brer Rabbit fans should know that the majority of the Remus canon, from which these tales are taken, are mostly out of print and hard to find even on the internet (sadly, most of the few available editions of Harris' original Rabbit/Remus tales don't even have the wonderful illustrations of Frederick Church, A.B. Frost, and the others-reading these tales without these delightful drawings is like cornflakes without milk or Abbott without Costello). This adds to the value of this book, as it has the stories and illustrations that are not available elsewhere.	2002-12-09

Anyone who does not care about the truth is in big trouble. For the record, the \\"Willie Lynch\\" letter was actually a recent creation, as evidenced by the language used. It was actually created in 1993 as a chain letter which spread like a bad disease throughout Black America. Research indicates that it was \\"loosely adapted\\" (to put it nicely) from a section of Anatoli Vinogradov's fictional 1935 novel \\"The Black Consul\\" that dealt with Napoleon's supposed plans to divide and conquer the Haitians during the Haitian revolution.<br /><br />We Black scholars and professional historians should take this as a wake up call to get out of the ivory tower and teach the masses REAL Black history to keep them from being misled by the clever crackpots who collect cash by confusing the credulous. The REAL story of the damage done to Blacks from slavery may be found in actual slave narratives like \\"The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass,\\" and detailed studies by legit scholars such as Carter G. Woodson's \\"Miseducation of the Negro\\" and Kenneth Stampp's \\"The Peculiar Institution.\\"<br /><br />ADDENDUM-The Durham (NC) News of April 6, 2013 reports that Dr. Kwabena Faheem Ashanti (aka Charles Davis) confessed that he was the true author of the forged Willie Lynch letter and he in composing this \\"in 1970 to promote my theory that blacks are conditioned to fear and seek acceptance from white people while degrading other blacks.\\" Google the above newspaper, subject and date if you do not believe this. Additionally, Dr. Ashanti admitted to author Prof. Manu Ampim in the latter's book \\"Death of the Willie Lynch Speech-Exposing the Myth\\" (pg. 40) that, \\"Unfortunately, I fooled many uncritical African American people.\\"<br /><br />So long Willie.

This is pure pseudo-history that has nothing more than emotional appeal for African-Americans and is a prime example of why Black scholars should get out of their ivory towers and teach the masses the truth about our history.<br />The truth about the effect of slavery on Black Americans can be found in slave narratives like \\"The Narrative of Frederick Douglass\\" and Kenneth Stampp's \\"The Peculiar Insitution.\\" Leave this Willie Lynch mess to the street-corner crackpots.	2002-11-05

I think the early Superman stories are good examples of exciting storytelling with interesting social commentary.<br />For example, the first Superman story contains a none-too subtle anticaptial punishment message, as our man saves a lady from an execution and a man form a lynching (remember, this is 1938). The second shows Supe stopping a war that is concocted by munitions manufactureres (an early anti-WW2 message). <br />Along with that, reading these early adventures gives you the feeling that you're a little kid in pre-television 1938-39, sitting with awe and wonder with these exciting tales either being read to you by a skilled adult storyteller, or by yourself with a flashlight at night. Once you get in that mood of an inner child, you can really get into this stuff and it's lots of fun.<br />However, I would agree that the cost is a bit much for a new edition. Buy a good used copy. Gather the kids (over age 10, that is) around, turn the lights down low, read it with vigor, and have a ball!	2002-10-30

Jesse Jackson.<br />Here you see both the good and bad. The infamous &quot;King's blood&quot; incident, the womanizing, the crudity and rudeness (that I've had the misfortune to expereince once), and the scandals are all here minus the Angela Parker case in 1971, oddly.<br />However, Frady does not let the reader forget the good that Jesse Jackson has done for society. We also him getting tearful Israeli and Palestinian children to come together in peace. We see him trying to unify poor Whites and Blacks in America (who even THINKS of doing that anymore?), we see him encouraging Black kids to forego delinquency and do better in school (I first saw him on one such occasion in 1978), and we see the successful instances in which he helped in the release of hostages. We also see that contrary to popular (mis)beleif, he has encouraged far more cooperation among the races than this far lesser contemporaries among what remains of &quot;Black leadership.&quot;<br />Frady lets the reader know that in spite of Rev. Jesse Jackson's considerable and numerous flaws, the good that he has done cannot be dismissed.<br />In spite of this, there is a minor complaint. Frady gets to be a bit much with the dialect in trying to capture Rev. J/J's speech patters (&quot;Yawl,&quot; &quot;Great Gawd a mighty,&quot; &quot;Looka heah,&quot; etc.).	2002-07-19

Rap/El-Amin's hilarious descriptions of pilfering items in Lyndon Johnson's White House, the story of his being stopped by the Louisiana cops for wearing ragged clothes, his refusal to eat or drink anything in prison for 43 DAYS (last time I checked in biology class, no human could go that long without water) etc. come off like wild tall tales told by one of Richard Pryor's characters. Even when the book is serious, there is never a dull moment. His observations on Ebony magazine, poor whites, and the explaination of the book's title, will make you laugh as well as think. Oh yeah, check out his &quot;Rap&quot; early on in the book, the contents of which would make NWA blush!<br />The recent noteriety of Rap/El-Amin adds a somber note to the proceedings, but in the meantime, read this.

Censorship and Vulagarity seem to be issues where there is no middle ground, but I will try to take it here in this review.<br />I think a credible case could be made here that Steve Allen was in fact the man who brought the likes of Lenny Bruce and Kerouac (as well as that ever-shining role model Jerry Lee Lewis) to national audiences, so it's easy for some to see this book as a hypocritical railing against modern &quot;entertainment,&quot; especially the somewhat prissy rant about the Mustard commerical that draws humor from the mustard bottle sounding like someone who has a bad gas attack. This book could have been easily written in any decade (after all, Steve throws in a few damns and hells himself here, which some still consider profane). I thought it was a bit much, on the chapter on gangster rap, to go through several pages of uncensored 2 Live Crew, Ice-T, and Eminem lyrics. One or two snippets of these kinds of lyrics would have been enough to get the point.<br />However, one has to admit that much of this is also justifiable. <BR>No one wants to hear small children in real life speaking or acting like Madonna, Howard Stern, Eminem, etc. One has to admit that it's true that modern entertainment IS getting dangerously close to the grotesque days of the Roman circuses.<br />(By the way, looks like Steve indulged in a bit of prophecy. In Charleston SC, Howard Stern was yanked off the air not because of low ratings, but because the advertisers got cold feet at beign associated with Stern's mess, just as Steve said would happen someday in this book)!	2002-04-01

Perhaps I should read it more than once to &quot;get it.&quot; The premise of Blacks uniting to solve the current problems of massive imprisonment and fratracide among the youth is a sound one that needs much attention. However, this is dealt with in a series of meandering and confusing essays that just don't seem to hang together and lessen the effectiveness of its message.<br />For example, one essay deals with the spectualtion of what life would be like in the Black America of 2076 with Robinson's great-granddaughter and the problems she faces. Obviously written before 9-11, this minimizes the effectiveness on today's readers as the fictional descendant reads newspaper clippings from 2000 and 2001 to where America went wrong. This kind of fictional specualtion is more Derrrick Bell's forte than Robisnon's.<br />The essays with the hip-hopper &quot;New Child&quot; and Robinson's 50 -year old &quot;homeboy&quot; from Richmond Va, whose life of crime Robinson tries desperately to understand contains too much stream of -consciousness type dialougue and obscure symbolism to have much of an effect on the reader. A more straightforward rendering, as James Baldwin did with similar material in &quot;Nobody Knows My Name&quot; and &quot;The Fire Next Time.&quot; would have certainly helped in getting his point across.<br />Robinson's points about the unwillingless and inability of so called Black &quot;leaders&quot; of today to solve the true (as opposed to symbolic) problems of African-Americans are sound and he is to be commended for bringing up the issue of our supposed leaders &quot;selling out&quot; to the political parties.

Ellsworth's (who graciously gave Madigan assistance with this volume) book on this subject was written in a scholarly &quot;matter of factly&quot; tone, well-written and long on historical detail but somewhat short of passion for the subject.  Madign gets deep into the emotions of the people behind the events and trasforms this detail into a story that the readers can identify with. The details and excellent use of primary sources makes it hard to beleive that it only took a year to write this book! Historians and casual readers will both find this book interesting (if extremely sad) reading. However, the ending does say much for the triumph of the human spirit and the book does give and interesting lesson to the depths and heights of human behavior.<br />You may still want to check out Ellworth's book for a primary introduction to the subject, as it goes a bit deeper into the background of Tulsa to understand the events.

Essentially, the great Folklorist Zora Neale Hurston spent 1928 and 29 among rural Blacks in Florida and Alabama jotting down their folk tales and witty sayings. Being a Black Southerner herself gave her an insider's access that made her interviewees comfortable in sharing with her. The final manuscript, &quot;Negro Folktales of the Gulf States&quot; remained unpublished till now. Some of these tales were published in 1935 with a framework story of Miss Hurston's adventures among her interviewees entitled &quot;Mules and Men.&quot; But here, the stories exist in their orignial, uncut form without a framework story. Once the modern reader becomes accustomed to the printed approximation of Southern African-American dialect, you can sit back and enjoy the folk wisdom and humorous tales.

This version contains excerpts from the classical ancient text and combines it with anecdotes and sayings of rasafarianism, which is itself a recent concept dating back to the days of Selassie's coronation in 1930 (another story altogther). Basically, this version tries to connect the classic text with modern rastafarianism. If you're interested in rastafarianism, you can go ahead with this. But if you're interested in an English translation of the actual Kebra Nagast (Glory of Kings), see the E.A. Wallace Budge translation or the Miguel Brooks translation.	2001-09-12

Nkrumah, Haile Selassie, Fidel Castro, and many others take their lumps here along with any Black person who diverts from his dogmatic view of Blackness.

I'll admit that the generalizations about the poor performance of Black students based on several classroom encounters were a bit much (being that I also teach mostly Black undergraduates and my expereinces have been different) and the generalization of African-Americans' ibnability to think analytically vs, rank emotionalism was somewhat of a stretch. But there is enough truth in this book to make it a valid read. Let's face it, too many of our Black &quot;leaders&quot; and writers play on the fact that many African-Americans live in fear of White opinion and exploit a &quot;seige mentality&quot; that makes many of us reluctant to deal with our problems. The common belief is that open discusion of internal flaws will give aid and comfort to the David Dukes of the world (and as anyone who has read Duke's website knows, this is not an unjustified fear).This is not a healthy thing and perhaps this book is a beginning of a dialogue that will put an end to that state of affairs. This book and some of the expected reaction to it reminds me of a quote by Robert F. Kennedy, &quot;Few men are willing to risk the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, and the wrath of their society.&quot; (1966). Mr. McWhorter, I may not agree with all that you say, but I respect your courage in saying it.	2001-08-02

This book is written with a heavy pro-Islamic point of view and he makes Islam seem flawless, so the section of Islam should be read with that in mind. However, some of his criticisms of Christianity, particularly his observation that the preachers themselves do not beleive what they are telling the masses is DEAD ON TARGET and should be taken into consideration, as he gives STRONG evidence to back up that point. As for his section Freemasonry, from what I have gathered some of that is well documented, although his claim that much of it is to keep people from learing the truth about Islam is somewhat far fetched. In either case, read this deservedly controversial book with an open mind.	2001-07-27

He also presents some progressive ideas on multiethnic coalitions being organized to fight oppression worldwide. <br />However, the writings take a downward turn around the time that Newton had been confirmed to have been taking hard drugs. His 1971 Yale speech is a mess of long-winded Marxist psychobabble and his defense of Melvin Van Peebles' ... pseudorevolutionary film \\"Sweet Sweetback\\" is laughable to those who are familiar with this ... film.

This is the history you didn't get from your high-school teacher! READ it!	2001-06-22

When religion is opposed to science, it becomes mere superstition. That which is contrary to knowledge is ignorance.&quot; Through this book, Abdul Baha (a.k.a. Abbas Effendi) shows how you can beleive and think at the same time.	2001-06-19

Powerful stuff, particualrly the sermon about &quot;The Monster&quot; (i.e., racial prejudice) near the end. However, there are some scenes that stretch credibility, such as his daring a redneck in Mississippi with a shotgun to blow his (Gregory's) brains out, his forcing his wife to answer whether she would prefer that he or his dead son died (you have to see the way this was written), etc. Some if it (and this is in character for Gregory for anyone who has heard Mr. Gregory speak in person) will make you say WHAT?	2001-06-19

Being a Black southerner who teachers this kind of history and who is not a full generation removed from all of this, this book hits the nail on the head. Too often, this era is told in a &quot;soft soap&quot; fashion, which is easly explained when you consider that so many people from this American gestapo era are still alive. You get all the facts here, from treasonous Blacks who sold out the people during segrgation (and who today pretend as if they were heroes at the time), to the evil cops who made Bull Connor look nice, to the horrbile conditions that Black southerners faced in education (I can tell you that not much has changed there), the damaging psychologicla effects of segregation on both Blacks and Whites, and to the young Blacks and Whites who came together to straighten up this mess. You get it raw, straight, and with no chaser here. Sorta the Southern female counterpart to &quot;Manchild in the Promised Land.&quot;	2001-06-19

Of course she would probably want to become a rapper today and much of the dialogue and situations are unique to that era. Children may find some sitations and dialougue dificult to relate to today, but their parents will dig.	2001-06-19

Billy Sunday's sermons worked well at a time when the masses of Americans were poorly educated and needed the hellfire and brimstone-school of religion to keep them from getting drunk, beating their spouses, and fornicating (but no sermons against lynching, financial exploitation, segregation, or the Ku Klux Klan which were also major evils of that era?). Sadly, many people still go along with this sort of thing and only theologians with the most backward congregations still preach in this fashion. For those with modern minds, it's good entertainment.	2001-06-14

Such as Malcolm's father (and Malcolm himself) setting their houses on fire, Malcolm's alleged homosexual activity,  Malcolm asking the Klan why they allowed Dr. King to live, etc. etc. One could see why Dr. Betty Shabazz (Malcolm's wife)told Perry to get lost!	2001-06-04

This book shows how this great friend of humanity stood up against mindless racism, poweful business interests, and the military and prison-industrial complex in the early 1900s without fear of the powers that be! The Canton, Ohio anti-World War I speech (which he was unjustly arrested for making) should have been read during the Gulf War farce and the only complaint that I have of this book is that it doesn't include his classic soliloquy to the Canton jury (although it's widely anthologized elsewhere). Today's schoolchildren who are short on true heroes should be taught of that great American who lived by his words &quot;I may not be able to say all that i think-but I will not say anything that I do not think!&quot; Mr. Eugene Victor Debs!	2001-06-04

You either hate him for his haughtiness and elitism or you love his militant stands. This collection of DuBois' writings shows that the truth was somewhere in between. We see DuBois change his mind on Marcus Garvey and the elitist &quot;Talented Tenth&quot; idea. We see DuBois evolve from Integrationism to Black Nationalism to Communism. We basically see a man who is not afraid to change his ideas and admit his errors, a very human and complex man.	2001-06-04

I read this along with several of the Apocryphal and Pseudopigriphal books of the Bible when I studied religion in college a few years ago. The original book of Enoch and the Secrets of Enoch (a.k.a. Enoch II) are quite interesting and revelaing. The story of the Fallen angels  in the Book of Enoch makes a good read, as well as the story of Enoch's expereinces in heaven in &quot;The Secrets of Enoch&quot; and the sayings from both books that are scattered throughout the current Bible. (To the good Christians who aren't in the know about the roots of Christianity, ask your pastors why they never told you about this stuff). <br />But as for Elizabeth Claire Prophet's analysis of all of this, that's strictly for the cuckoo patch, especially the absurd songs to Enoch.	2001-05-31

I can testify to all of the truths that this book tells. However, he doesn't go far enough in describing how the current crop of thieves in the temple bamboozle the trusting women in the Black community. Case in point, he only breifly (almost as a throwaway line) mentions that most educated preachers know in their hearts that they're mostly preaching mythology to the masses. That is a key point that needs to be expounded upon! The fact that so many people were shocked and dismayed over the recent revelations about Jesse Jackson shows that books like this are still needed for a wake-up call to the Black masses who have been looking in the wrong places for deliverance. I also recommend \\"The Slave Master's Religion\\" by Glenn Royster for further reading.	2001-05-31

Senator Kennedy's 1966 South Africa speech(&quot;The Day of Affirmation&quot;) and his powerfully truthful message at Los Angeles' Greek Theater on March 24, 1968 gives young people an idea of a long-ago time when people really believed in politicians and politicians really believed in the people.

Racial epithets in the descriptions of the Black characters are spewed in almost every story and great fun is made of the ignorance and illiteracy of African-Americans in these tales. One truly horrid episode has a White writer playing a \\"joke\\" on the local Blacks convincing them that they will die from a disease called \\"ancestors\\" and great fun is made of the Blacks' belief that they are about to die! Amos and Andy was quite enlightened comapred to this! Considering that this was written at a time when lynchings and segregation were widespread toward African-Americans, \\"More E.K.

It's a good way for the uninitiated to learn the &quot;other side&quot; of US history. To be fair, Zinn gives both the left and right their just deserts (his comments on Bill Clinton, Harry Truman, and the Socialist Party's failure to speak out against racism and war in the early 1900s should give pause to those who think Zinn is too far to the left. I do wish, however, that Zinn was more critical of the excesses of the &quot;New Left&quot; and sexual revolution).<br />The only real complaint that I have about this otherwise great book is that it doesn't have footnotes to give you the exact source of each quote, which would have been helpful in many cases. But the bibliography that the late Professor Zinn provides may be of some help for professional historians or those who just like to dig deeper.	2001-05-29

Tells a lot of raw truths about religion and it's profiteers. However, it claifies the differences between the reality of God and the concept of religion which has traditionally used to liberate a few and enslave the masses. Unfortunately, dated elements as rabid anti-Catholicism and pro-Bolshevism mar this message for modern readers, but if you can read this book with an open mind, it's quite revealing.	2001-05-18

It shows, in the Selma Alabama Speech, his ability to explain the root causes of segregation (which all Americans should understand), it shows his courage in being able to stand up to the powers that be in his Vietnam speech, and it shows his amazing ability to improvise amazing speeches in the 1955 Bus Boycott speech. In short, it shows the genius of Dr. King and I have used this book in class to teach my students that Dr. King was about more than dreaming dreams.	2001-05-18
