It seems that the Robicheaux series just keeps churning out brilliance but CRUSADER'S CROSS even exceeds the high expectations set forth by previous installments. Longtime followers of the series will find their favorite Cajun detective still alive and kicking with sidekick Clete Purcel, this time uncovering the secret surrounding the disappearance of a woman fifty years in Dave's past.<br /><br />This book is classic Burke in many ways: the story, the setting, the prose, and more. The fact that this installment is coming along now is ironic, considering how much New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou country has been in the news over the last several months. Everyone has felt a connection to the area and many Robicheaux fans watched the coverage of Hurricane Katrina with their hearts a little heavier because of the connection we feel to the region through these books. The language is beautifully descriptive and the story is one of the finest in the series. We also get to see Dave's half-brother Jimmie, a rare commodity.<br /><br />Clete is classic Clete. Every Robicheaux fan knows of which I speak.<br /><br />The book leaves you breathing a breath of fresh air and you are somewhat disappointed that it has to end. At the same time, you almost feel that the final sentences were the final words in the series.<br /><br />But fear not Dave fans, the new book is already in the works. I, as well as many others, can't wait to read it.	2005-10-08
US	37660287	RFXP910HS6U09	0399147284	853678814	Chosen Prey	Books	4	1	4	N	N	A fast, slightly flawed read.	One thing that holds true about many of the PREY novels is this: if people like the villain truly exist...be afraid. This time Lucas is matched up with a sex-addicted serial killer/artist who literally gets off on the kill. James Qatar is brutal and calculating, and seemingly uncatchable for the longest time.<br /><br />This is a fast read, both due to the fast pace and the relatively short length. The glaring problem to me is the same problem that has appeared in every PREY novel. Profanity is necessary. I understand that, but the constant use of \\"GD\\" is over the top. It's excessive and really takes away from the reading experience after a while.<br /><br />Otherwise, a great read.	2005-08-17

You're either a writer, or you're not. You can't read a book that will \\"make\\" you a writer. It's something that comes from within you, something that is inborn. For those who desire to write and become better writers this is the ultimate guidebook. Covering every subject from writing structure and keeping yourself from getting rusty to tips on getting published and even a special section on dealing with Hollywood, LESSONS takes on for a test drive in the life of a writer.<br /><br />Does this mean you have to have aspirations of being a professional full-time writer in order to learn from this book? Absolutely not. Anyone that writes creatively (novels, screenplays, poetry, etc.) can take something away. Best of all, the book is presented by one of the best fiction writers of our time, David Morrell.<br /><br />If you love to write, for whatever reason, pick up a copy and run through it a time or two.

The majority of the short pieces offered in this collection were created for THE NEW YORKER but anyone who can understand the language can enjoy the jokes. This isn't a print version of his classic standup (as so many books by comedians are) and the humor isn't the in-your-face slapstick stuff that so many deem necessary. Steve Martin is, and always has been, on another level.<br /><br />Another important point that this book gets across, although likely unintentionally, is that, even in today's market, funny does not have to equal explicit. Profanity isn't necessary for great comedy. This book won't make your grandmother blush due to constant F-bombs.<br /><br />If you didn't get past the ninth grade, this book isn't for you. Otherwise, it's a highly entertaining read.	2005-08-11

Those who bought this book hoping to be entertained with crazy tales from back stage at World Wrestling Entertainment events will be sorely disappointed. The casual reader, however, is treated to the story of a regular guy from the heart of Texas that works himself to death because it's all he knows. Stone Cold Steve Austin makes some appearances, but the story of Steve Williams is a joy to read.<br /><br />This look at the man behind the Rattlesnake persona is a breath of fresh air. It's not the run of the mill 'I love wrestling. I've always wanted to do it.' battlecry. It's real. It's about the man, not the character.<br /><br />The book is just over 300 pages, and I finished it in a matter of only 5 or 6 hours. It's a fast, entertaining read and the only problem is that it leaves you wanting to know more. Perhaps that will happen down the road.<br /><br />To those who were 'disappointed' to learn about the friendship between Steve and Vince McMahon...you must have forgotten that the storylines are just that...STORYLINES.

Finishing this book leaves you with several impressions, the strongest one being that Mancow loves Amsterdam. The tales of his outlandish skits on the radio show, Mancow's Morning Madhouse, his wild nights with even wilder women, his experimentation of herbal substances and other insanities are co-mingled with stories about his father and his childhood that give the reader a good look at how Erich Muller became Mancow.

A great premise, a fast pace, and beautiful descriptions. The character development was done quite well, and the hook comes early in the plot.<br /><br />What's with all of the concern about Grisham's many references to the sights, sounds and smells of Italy? Personally, I felt it added much to the reading experience. With the heart of the story taking place in Italy, the details were very much needed. It gives you a reason to put yourself in Backman's shoes, to see what he sees, hear what he hears, etc. It gives you the chance to feel as unfamiliar as he does in Bologna, every sight, sound, and feeling a learning experience.<br /><br />The end seemed a little anticlimactic, but that can happen when the rest of the rising action is at such a high level. Nevertheless, a great page turner, a quick and exciting read, and Grisham's return to form.	2005-02-23

Mitch Albom's works first became mainstream with TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, a modern classic that was later made into a TV movie starring Hank Azaria. This could be his best effort yet, and its time on the New York Times bestseller list is evidence.<br /><br />It's amazing how such a small book can have such a large meaning. When you read the synopsis on the cover, you have an idea of what the book is truly about...or so you think. It follows a man named Eddie and \\"begins at the end\\" with his death while attempting to save a little girl at an amusement park. The rest is explained both by Amazon and in the rest of the reviews. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the true meaning isn't what you're lead to believe it is. This isn't about death or the afterlife...it's about life. It's about right now. Every action has an effect, perhaps on you, perhaps on those around you, whether you realize it or intend it or not. Every story is connected in one larger scheme that we're not fully aware of.<br /><br />As a result, this book leaves you feeling different than what you felt before you read it. Sure it requires some abstract thought to fully delve into the meaning of what Albom is trying to say, but it becomes progressively more clear as Eddie meets his five people. Each person teaches him a lesson, and the puzzle is complete when he understands the purpose of his life. The reader is left with a gift that isn't usually given when a book is read: a new outlook at life. You never truly know what effect you have on people, positive or negative, intentional or accidental, regardless of how small of an act it may seem to be. It makes you think twice before railing someone for something petty, and allows you to consider a nice word for someone you'd normally ignore. You just never know.<br /><br />While it may not seem so now, this book could very well go down as one of the best of the last 25 years. It's difficult to sum up the high points and the reading experience in a few words...intelligent, thought-provoking, warmhearted, well-written...but there is one word that sums it up perhaps better than any.<br /><br />Brilliant.in a few words...intelligent, thought-provoking, warmhearted, well-written...but there is one word that sums it up perhaps better than any. <br /> <br />Brilliant.	2004-12-14

Robicheaux and his familiar cast of characters are in top form, as is Burke's writing, in JOLIE BLON'S BOUNCE.<br /><br />The synopsis for the story is already available here, but to me the most intriguing part of the book is the cast of characters. Legion Guidry is one of the most interesting, formidable, and flat out frightening characters that Burke has created throughout the series. Is he just a bad man, is he possessed...what IS wrong with him? He's possibly the only adversary that Dave Robicheaux has had that truly scared him. Of course the constant sidekick for Dave throughout all of the novels has been his former partner and friend Clete Purcel. Clete has always been interesting and at times hilarious, but this book shows perhaps better than any other the connection that these two have. Clete has been the only constant for Dave throughout everything, and their friendship really adds a lot to the series.<br /><br />Burke's writing and prose is at its best. The beautiful descriptive prose, believable characters, plausible plot, and exciting action combine for what may be his best overall effort since 1990's award-winning BLACK CHERRY BLUES.<br /><br />Not a long read, at 349 pages, but a fast and exciting one. Fully recommended. Enjoy!	2004-11-18

Jason Bourne (AKA David Webb) is back, but not of own accord. Assassinations are taking place across the globe and the killer's name is Jason Bourne, but the REAL Jason Bourne is now an associate professor in Maine. Against his will, he's thrown back into his former life in order to track down the imposter, but things, of course, are not as they seem.<br /><br />This is typical Ludlum. Big time plot, many action packed scenes, and vocabulary that is mostly only for those with at least a college education. While not as good as THE BOURNE IDENTITY, this one certainly holds its own.<br /><br />One complaint I've seen about this book is how hard it was to follow, and I just did not see that at all. I found 'SUPREMACY' to very well organized and easy to follow. From the middle of the book on, there are three and four storylines in progress at the same time, yet all the action one storyline is kept independant from any of the others. Each chapter concentrates on one storyline only, and by the end of the book they are all interwoven together to form a great conclusion.<br /><br />One complaint that I had is that some of the dialogue just seemed off. It seemed fake and, at times, forced. Another problem is the incessant internal dialogue from Bourne. Everyone talks to themselves now and then but it truly became tiresome as the book wore on. Anyone who talked to themselves that much, in the form of TWO different personalities, would be locked down in a padded institution and not running black ops missions for the federal government...at their request no less.<br /><br />All in all, the pros outweigh the cons and this is a great job by Robert Ludlum. As the second of three books in Ludlum's 'Bourne' series, it shines a great light on who Jason Bourne was, David Webb is, and where his life with Marie is headed. Very enjoyable and certainly recommended.	2004-11-11

Although I had heard of Vince Flynn's series of novels featuring Mitch Rapp, MEMORIAL DAY is the first one I decided to take for a test run. What I found what an action-packed thriller set at a blistering pace and a main character that may not stay inside the box that the government would like for him to, but you like him anyway. You have to...he does things the way you'd like to see them done and he gets results.<br /><br />MEMORIAL DAY is also a prime example of the way that the CIA/Spy/International Thriller genre is headed in a post-9/11 world. In the 80s, the villians tended to be Russian. Now, the targets have become Al-Qaeda and those countries that harbor and support them. Not to worry...there are still plenty of Russian villians running loose in popular fiction. MEMORIAL DAY's premise begins with Mitch Rapp foiling an attempt to smuggle a nuclear weapon onto American soil, and right around one of the biggest tourist holidays on the calendar. This plot element alone makes the entire storyline plausible. This is something that every American citizen fears whenever there is a large event planned. New Year's Eve in Times Square...the Super Bowl...the World Series...name it. I won't go into any more detail on the plot...you'll just have to read it.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the writing as well. Sharp, concise, and to the point but not over the top vocabulary. Everything is organized well and easy to follow for any reader.<br /><br />All in all, I was very impressed with this very enjoyable read and look forward to checking out the rest of the Mitch Rapp series...not to mention the next installment.	2004-11-01

Joel Rosenberg burst onto the fiction scene with the New York Times bestseller \\"THE LAST JIHAD\\", and did not disappoint with this followup \\"THE LAST DAYS\\".<br /><br />'DAYS' picks up where 'JIHAD' left off, with Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden both dead and Baghdad in ruins. All the main characters of the first installment are back, and the action doesn't let up.<br /><br />The underlying direction of the storyline is one that should have special meaning to any Christian that reads either of the two books. While neither the title or the synopsis of either book specifically states as much, the entire story takes place leading up to the Last Days prior to the Seven Year Tribulation and the return of Christ. I won't reveal any story elements, but there are several occurances in the plot of the book that are intricate in God's final timeline, things like the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount and the rebuilding of Babylon (in Iraq).<br /><br />One thing I did notice is that each chapter and each scene change is started with a one sentence paragraph. I don't know if that is just the author's trademark or what, but it almost seems like a slight lack of confidence in his writing...something that is not well founded. I've found Rosenberg's writing to be very full and entertaining, without being over the top like some authors who seem to be trying to impress the reader with their vocabulary skills.<br /><br />As was the case with 'JIHAD', again this one ends somewhat unresolved. I can only hope that that means a third book is on the way soon.	2004-09-06

George Plimpton was the first, in the sports world, to employ \\"participatory journalism\\" in order to produce a story, or in this case a book. Over the years, Plimpton put himself in several different positions for the sake of his readers... hockey goalie... prizefighter... pitcher... he even tagged along on the PGA Tour. However, none of those really hit home on a large scale quite like PAPER LION, the story of Plimpton's trials and errors in training camp with the Detroit Lions prior to the 1963 season. It even led to a movie starring Alan Alda by the same name.<br /><br />When PAPER LION was published in the mid-1960's, it was a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at professional football. Before the days of constant national television coverage, Monday Night Football, hour after hour of pregame shows, or the NFL Network, this book was truly the first look at what goes on before a season for the players that you'll be cheering for when fall rolls around. Plimpton's premise was that he was coming in as an unheralded rookie just trying to find a position to play, but it wasn't long until his secret was out.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is that Plimpton was anything but an athlete. He came into this setting having never played a down of organized football in his life. That being said, the strides he made in a four week period were astonishing. Granted he wasn't going to make the team as a 36-year old rookie, but he certainly made progress leading up to his time in the intrasquad scrimmage. More important than the actual time on the practice field is the look he provided into the inner workings of the Detroit Lions program; the life in training camp after the day's practice had ended and everyone was back in their rooms or out on the town. As passionate as fans can be, some of them tend to forget that their gladiators of the gridiron have lives outside of the playing field. Reading about the lives of the Lions players, from the well known names of Alex Karras and Night Train Lane to the relative unknown players like Lucien Reeberg, adds a dimension to the league that went uncharted until this was published.<br /><br />What makes this work so great is the fact that it is truly timeless, despite the fact that is was written 41 years ago, 4 years before the first Super Bowl! When it was first unleashed in the mid-1960's, PAPER LION was a great behind the scenes look at an NFL team in training camp. Now, a reader is treated to an amazing commentary showing the progression of professional football from then to now. Gone is the innocence and the flat out passion of those years, replaced by steroids and money hungry athletes. Are there players now who remind the reader of the players from that era? Look at Brett Favre. But that's become rare. If PAPER LION was being written today, Plimpton may have had an entirely new perspective. He may have been granted a roster spot because five different players were holding out for \\"contract reasons\\". He may have spent his time writing about unnamed players using illegal performance enhancers or engaging in other illegal activities, not writing about the team going out to a club for some dancing after practice or initiating the rookies with Fright Masks. My how times have changed. The offensive and defensive schemes have changed, and the overall attitude of the players has done a 180. Yet, football is more popular than ever.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you're a football fan that remembers that era of the game, or if you're a young fan taking a look back, PAPER LION is an enjoyable read for football fans and non-football fans alike.<br /><br />Just don't try to imagine George Plimpton doing an endzone celebration dance.

Along with the many other things in the world that the events of 9-11-01 changed, the world of the international thriller genre of popular fiction changed as well. The direction of these novels is never more apparent than in Joel Rosenberg's \\"The Last Jihad\\".<br /><br />Published in 2002, part of the initial storyline is already outdated. To prefix the book, it's stated the Osama Bin Laden is dead and Saddam Hussein is the threat to the world. In our present state, Hussein is in custody and Bin Laden is still at large. Nevertheless, the premise is both credible and exciting. From the opening chapters, the events that happen to and surrounding the President are not only chilling but all too real.  Just as Clancy's view of terror attacks and thwarted terror attacks in \\"Debt Of Honor\\" and \\"Rainbow Six\\" were before their time, the same could be said for Rosenberg. The events seem to be ripped from headlines of the future.<br /><br />It's not just the plot that makes this such an easy yet fun read. Rosenberg's writing style flows very well. Some authors see fit to use over the top language that makes you think they're just trying to impress the reader with their vocabulary, but Rosenberg keeps it simple and let's the story, the action, and the characters do all the work.<br /><br />The story and the characters also have added meaning for any Christian reading the book. It's obvious that the author himself is a Christian, and this is reflected in several of his characters. You can see the influence that this has on his characters, and in the language used in his book, and is something that is welcome to the world of fiction.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic effort from a fairly new author on the popular fiction scene and one that makes me anticipate the sequel, \\"The Last Days\\", even more. In fact, I'm ordering it now.	2004-08-13

It's hard to believe that it has been 11 years since Murphy retired, and 18 years since this book was written, but this book still remains a great read for all Dale Murphy fans (and lifetime Atlanta Braves fans). Written just before the 1986 season, Murphy looks back at the many aspects, achievements, and milestones of his life: growing up in the Pacific northwest, his childhood baseball days, his rise through the minors, his back-to-back MVP seasons in 1982 and 1983, and even a look at Murph's personal side from his family life to his life in the Mormon church.<br />Ironically, Dale's best season came after he wrote this book. In 1987 he his 44 home runs with 105 RBI...and didn't win the MVP (that went to Andre Dawson of the Cubs who hit 49). Nevertheless, this book is a print version of the Dale Murphy persona that attracted one of the largest fan followings of that era of sports and one that remains to this day. I should know...I'm a lifelong fan. I even have a wonderful personal story about an encounter with him at a game in Cincinnati in 1989. There is no excuse for him NOT being in the Hall of Fame (but Kirby Puckett and Gary Carter are...go figure).<br />Get the book. You won't be disappointed.	2004-07-15

In RAINBOW SIX, we see the return of John Clark as the lead character in a typical heavy, meaningful plot that Clancy has done on a level above any other author for many years. The theme of the book, and the video games that have followed, is a multinational counter-terrorism unit called Rainbow, with John Clark running the show. One reviewer stated that this is the typical &quot;Americans are the best...&quot; plot, but it's really not. Rainbow is formed by members of several countries, including the United States, England, Germany, and Israel. It's not just a United States dominated unit.<br />From the opening pages on, Clancy paints a brilliant picture of life on Earth in a post-9/11 world...and then you realize that this book was written and published in 1998! The ability that Clancy has shown to be ahead of his time in his plots is just another example of his brilliance. This is reflected again in an earlier Clancy novel, DEBT OF HONOR, from 1996, where in the climax we read through a scene frighteningly similar to the events of 9/11/01. RAINBOW SIX, while thick at 740 pages, is really a fast read. Clancy interweaves multiple storylines and more than a handful of characters into an overall story that truly has you thinking about the world around you by the time you finish. With action sequence after action sequence, the book rarely hits a lull and keeps you enthralled to the point that you're disappointed to set it down. One nice part of it all is that the book shows that there are left-wing extremist crazy people out there too...all the insane ones aren't right-wingers as most in the media will lead you to believe.<br />Great books make you think. With that in mind, RAINBOW SIX is a great book by one of the greatest authors of our time. Now...let's get that movie into production.	2004-07-11

Over the last 15 years, James Lee Burke's character of Louisiana detective Dave Robicheaux has been established as one of the best and most intriguing in modern crime fiction. The intrigue continues  in the fourth book of the Robicheaux series, A MORNING FOR FLAMINGOS. This time we find Dave critically wounded and his partner killed after a prisoner transport goes awry. After his recovery, Dave is sent undercover by the DEA to try to bring down a drug dealer from his old stomping ground, New Orleans.<br />Dave's old homicide partner Clete Purcel is a big part of this novel, as well as the rest of the series, and is the no-holds-barred sometimes law-bending character that Robicheaux fans are used to. We also find another appearance from DEA agent Minos Dautrieve, who had a big role in the earlier Burke novel (and subsequent film starring Alec Baldwin) HEAVEN'S PRISONERS. These two, along with all the others surrounding the story, provide a great story for the reader.<br />The story is believable, the characters are believable, and at times the reader really starts to sympathize with people in the story that you are really not supposed to be cheering for!

James Lee Burke's lead series character of Dave Robicheaux has become one of my favorites of recent years, and the latest in the Robicheaux series, LAST CAR TO ELYSIAN FIELDS, certainly does not disappoint. While not necessarily long at around 340 pages, Burke still manages to easily maintain three different storylines that, while seemingly independent of each other, all come together nicely in the end. This installment also illustrates the latest changes in Dave's life as he grows older and wiser. With his daughter Alafair at college and his wife Bootsie deceased, Dave continues on in his life alone. As always, colorful character and Dave's former partner Clete Purcel is a big part of the story and it's always interesting watching the two go back and forth.<br /><br />The finest recurring quality of all of Burke's books is the beautifully descriptive prose. With the setting in the Louisiana bayou, Burke's colorful descriptions lets you close your eyes and imagine the setting with relative ease.<br /><br />The only drawback from the book came late in the book. On several instances in the last hundred pages, it really seemed as if the author was trying to push his political agenda on the reader. The remarks had nothing to do with the characters, had nothing to do with the storyline, and really distracted me from the reading experience for a few pages as I tried to figure out why those remarks were there.<br /><br />Outside of that, this is a classic Burke and evidence that neither he nor Dave Robicheaux are showing any signs of slowing down!	2004-06-22

It's even harder to believe that David Morrell has kept up the frantic pace of his novels for this many years without slowing down or missing a beat.<br />The main character of THE PROTECTOR is essentially a super-bodyguard in the same mold of the main character of Morrell's best-selling novel ever, THE FIFTH PROFESSION (whose protagonist, Savage, is an 'executive protector').

David Baldacci set the bar high for himself with his first huge hit, ABSOLUTE POWER (which later became a movie starring Clint Eastwood). He also reaches that bar with this effort, THE WINNER. Combining a plot not previously explored in popular fiction with believable characters and great writing, Baldacci produces a book worthy of a future screenplay.<br />The heroine, LuAnn Tyler, is a young Southern woman who receives an offer she can't refuse...an offer to win millions of dollars in a lottery that is fixed. The offer is made by a mysterious man named Jackson. As the novel progresses, Jackson develops into one of the most brilliant, calculating antagonists of recent memory. The man seems unstoppable! LuAnn's bodyguard Charlie is a constantly important character as is Matt Riggs, who is thrust into LuAnn's life by random chance.<br />As the novel progresses, it thrives not only on the lottery scam but also LuAnn's love for her daughter and her desire to protect her at any cost...and it plays into the hands of the reader, making you ask yourself if YOU would make the same decisions and take the same risks as she had. This added element really adds to the reading experience.<br />All in all, this is Baldacci's best work since Absolute Power. Hopefully, the trend will continue in his future works.	2004-06-15
US	37660287	R37VD988IVSBXP	0679443940	649248352	By George:: The Autobiography of George Foreman	Books	5	6	7	N	N	My undisputed favorite biography.	Whether it's for his knockouts in the ring, or his grills that knockout the fat, just about everyone in the civilized world knows the name George Foreman. While most sports fans know that Foreman wasn't always the oversized teddy bear that he is now, the stories relayed in the first half of his autobiography, BY GEORGE, will amaze you.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Foreman not only outlines the rise of his boxing career from the Olympics to the professional ranks and the heavyweight championship (twice), but he also delves into his personal life in a detailed manner that provides the reader with an in-depth look into the George Foreman that many never knew existed.<br /><br />The somewhat underlying story in this book is his relationship with God. In the first half of the book, Foreman tells of how, when he was young, he thought that religion was for the weak and it wasn't something he needed in his life. More amazing is that Foreman, now a Baptist minister, nearly became a Muslim before his legendary fight with Muhammad Ali in 1974. Following his bout with Jimmy Young in 1977, his final fight before his 10 year layoff, Foreman had a 'religious experience' in his locker room, found the Lord, and started to become the George Foreman that the world knows and loves today. In the second half of the book, the reader truly begins to see Foreman's love for God, and how God influences every aspect of his life.<br /><br />While many know the ups and downs of his boxing career, it's very interesting to relive those moments through the eyes of the man who was there. His mentality change between his first and second boxing careers is astonishing. As a Christian, this book has added meaning for me due to the issues mentioned above. Simply put, this is a book that is an inspiration to one and all.	2004-06-06

Most readers of John Sandford are fans of the 'Prey' series featuring Lucas Davenport, but the Kidd series is a change of pace but still features the same action-packed pace that we've come to expect from Sandford (with a higher concentration on technology).<br />This was my first taste of the Kidd series and it was actually a good read. Kidd, the lead character, is a part-time painter, part-time hi-tech hacker/thief, who always seems to get dragged into the government's business...and not the good part of the government. Along with his partner, and sometime lover, LuEllen, they get in and out of messes several times over.<br />While there are a couple of lulls in the action, this is still a very well written book with an interesting, hi-tech plot that remains very easy to follow whether you're computer literate or not. THE DEVIL'S CODE may not be at the top of you &quot;to read&quot;<br />list, but it should be there somewhere. If nothing else, read it so you'll have a good level of familiarity with the Kidd series before you start on one of the great books of the last couple of years, and the fourth Kidd series book, THE HANGED MAN'S SONG.	2004-05-28

Starting in &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;, readers of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels were always treated to a visit from recurring character John Clark, the mystery man from the CIA that is sent in to do the dirtiest of dirty work and always comes out ahead. The question that lingered was, &quot;Who is John Clark and where did he come from?&quot;. Clancy brought us this book to answer those questions.<br />The book's setting is enough to intrigue me, seeing as it was set in 1970 and I wasn't born until 12 years later! It reflects a different time period than the rest of the Clancy novels, which means a much smaller reliance on technology and more attention given to the personal aspect of the story (much like &quot;Patriot Games&quot;). At this point, John Clark isn't John Clark...he's John Kelly, the ex-Navy SEAL, an honest, hard-working man who has just lost his wife in a car accident. I won't go into what happens in the actual plot, but at times Kelly is forced to cross the lines of law to take necessary action, and even rejoins the service of his country.<br />Later in the book, John Kelly assumes the moniker and the identity that Clancy readers have come to love...John Clark. There are times in the book that you can't believe some of the things that the 'good guy' is doing, but you're still rooting for him because it's part of the story and it's what HAS to happen. The character, and the plot, is extremely well written.<br />Besides Clark, several other familiar Clancy characters are found in WITHOUT REMORSE. James Greer, Robert Ritter (from Clear and Present Danger), and a few others. Minor, yet recurring, character development is something that Clancy is an absolute master at.<br />Even at 750 pages, WITHOUT REMORSE flies by with its furious pace and non-stop action. For an avid reader like myself it's tough for new books to be called one of my favorites, but WITHOUT REMORSE has managed to do just that.	2004-05-26

While this isn't a bad book, and actually did keep my interest, it wasn't the dynamic page-turner that I was hoping for.<br />Like others have said, the opening stages are a little rough. The plot is intriguing but as the book wears on, it becomes predictable. You know what is going to happen, just not HOW it is going to happen. There was a nice twist at the end, but not enough of one to get the book up to 4 stars.<br />It's a good read overall but not a top priority book. If you have a choice, go for a David Morrell, Tom Clancy, Gayle Lynds, or someone in that class.	2004-05-16

The mystique of Dave Robicheaux continues in this book, the 3rd installment of the series. Throughout the book you can feel Dave's pain as he remembers Annie, who died in Heaven's Prisoners. He's still struggling with the alcoholism that once wrecked his life, and his main focus is caring for his daughter Alafair. Burke, as usual, does a tremendous job developing his characters, all the while staying in the first person...telling the story from Dave's eyes. Dave is a flawed hero, but you're pulling for him regardless. Another gem from James Lee Burke, and it just adds to the puzzle that the Robicheaux series has become.	2004-05-03

While the &quot;Prey&quot; series featuring Lucas Davenport is more widely known, the Kidd series just seems to have even more intrigue than the well-written Prey novels. Kidd is just on the other side of the law, brash, and technologically-sound to the point that computers can get him anything he wants. Sure it's not legal, but you find yourself cheering him on...his actions are illegal, but he's still the protagonist!<br />The plot centers around the murder of Bobby, a character all readers of the Kidd novels are familiar with. I won't go into the details of the plot so nothing gets spoiled, but I'll admit that when I first read the synopsis, I figured I wouldn't like the fact that Bobby was killed off.<br />I was wrong.<br />As the story comes together, things begin to make sense. But in the final few pages of the book, everything is revealed and you finally understand why it was necessary for Bobby to be killed off...and you begin to wonder what the next Kidd adventure will be because so many possibilities have been opened up!<br />Best Kidd book yet...but the ones that are upcoming are sure to be right on par as well!	2004-04-04

A few years ago I noticed that Gayle Lynds had cowritten a few books with the great Robert Ludlum (the &quot;Bourne&quot; series). Since then, she has started writing solo novels and this one is simply a masterpiece. Non-stop action, a gripping plot, writing that is well-structured but not over the top, and characters you can understand.<br />As the storyline plays out, you often find yourself wondering where it will go next...and the unexpected turns just add to the thrill ride.

Burke has done a great job in creating a realistic hero in Dave Robicheaux. Rather than your typical perfect, mistake-free protagonist, Robicheaux is clearly flawed but you want to root for him. The heart of the Vietnam vet, retired homicide detective, and recovering alcoholic comes through particularly well because of Burke's exceptional first-person writing style. This is truly a work of art, and it sets the tone well for the rest of the series.	2004-03-05

Americans haven't truly had a no nonsense Commander In Chief since the early 80s with Ronald Reagan, but Jack Ryan certainly provides that in Executive Orders. If you loved it when Reagan shot a missile into Gadhafi's tent 20 years ago, you will LOVE the final sequence of this one!<br />At over 1000 pages (paperback) it's a long read, but a FAST read. Simply a Clancy masterpiece, and his best work of the last 8 or 9 years.	2004-03-05

So many of the 'spy thrillers' of recent day seem recycled (for lack of a better word). Ludlum did a fantastic job of not only creating a unique storyline, but a unique lead character in 'Jason Bourne'. In the opening stages of the book, not only is Bourne a mystery to the reader, he is a mystery to himself. It's as if you are learning about Bourne as he does (as an amnesiac). The plot has central ties in Paris, but the characters make appearances around the world. By the end of the book, it seems as if the protagonist is completely riddled with bullet holes but still manages to come out alive. This is the first (of 3) in the Bourne series. If you've seen the movie (which was very good), make sure you still read the book. The book is even better...which is usually the case.	2004-02-12

I have always enjoyed David Morrell's writing style, his genre, and his characters. In fact, my top two favorite books of all-time are his ('The Brotherhood Of The Rose' and 'The Fraternity Of The Stone'). This one, however, just lacked something going down the stretch.<br />The storyline is promising. Brendan Buchanan, a military intelligence operative, is forced to assume an identity more foreign to him than any other...his own. A newspaper reporter, Holly McCoy, is found to be following Buchanan as he tries to track down a women from his past that had sent him a distress signal.<br />The plot takes the cast of characters all across the United States, into Mexico, and other locations as well. The looks into the identities that Buchanan is forced to assume as part of assignments AND to protect himself otherwise definitely add something to the story. However, thr final sequences of the book, and the fact that one of the main parts of the storyline is unresolved, leave you feeling somewhat empty. The action scenes are classic Morrell, as is the prose, but the end seemed rushed.<br />Still a good read.	2004-02-11

Clancy has decided to go in a different direction with The Teeth Of The Tiger, focusing on Jack Ryan Jr. and his two cousins Dominic and Brian Caruso rather than on Jack Ryan Sr.. While short (for Clancy) at 431 pages, there is plenty of action. After a seemingly slow start, in which Clancy sets up not only the storyline but also the new characters that could be the basis for a new series, the book goes absolutely nuts beginning with a mall shootout. Throughout the book, the events that take place are not only brilliantly described but frighteningly real. Clancy has always seemed to think ahead of his time (see \\"Debt Of Honor\\"), and this is another case. This is a perfect plot for a post-9/11 thriller and while not his best, it's his best effort since 1996's \\"Executive Orders\\". Great read.	2003-09-01

This story follows Savage, an executive protector and ex-Navy SEAL.

On that mission, Savage crosses paths with Akira, a Japanese executive protector that Savage was assigned with six months prior...under strange circumstances.

Among other reasons, one thing that makes Tom Clancy stand out from most other authors is his ability to innovate. Plotlines that have rarely been explored before but are not only plausible but realistic.<br />Due to mistreatment of the gas tanks in a popular Japanese car, a major safety defect causes a normal traffic accident to end the life of several Americans including one entire family. This starts a chain reaction that ultimately ends trade between the United States and Japan. The damage done to Japan's economy allows one businessman, Raizo Yamata to organize an attack on the United States' military and economy sparking an eventual war. In the middle of this mess, as you would have guessed, is the new National Security Advisor Jack Ryan.<br />The action doesn't really get kickstarted until the fourth or fifth chapter and some of the middle chapters are chocked full of fluff. While this book could have probably been written in about 650 pages (rather than 990), the plot rings true and the cliffhanger ending will amaze you. Especially now...and remember that this book was written in 1997....pre-9/11.<br />This book is very much worth your time, but only if you plan on reading the follow-up, Executive Orders, as soon as you finish the last page of Debt Of Honor.

Now, I find myself wondering when his next book is coming! This is a classic action book complete with futuristic weapons, a great plot, and a group of pissed off revenge seeking Marines. The Marines vow to avenge the torture and ultimate murder of two of their comrades, and manage to avoid capture by foreign governments as well as their own! This is a five-star book, but I took away the fifth star because of the repeated use of \\"GD\\" which was certainly excessive. Minus that, an incredible read.	2003-06-08

For readers of \\"The Brotherhood Of The Rose\\", this is the follow up. The lead character, Drew MacLane, is according to Morrell a \\"reinvention\\" of Chris from 'Brotherhood'. Drew has entered a monastery after a life as an assassin, but is tracked down after six years and is now on the run. Just like 'Brotherhood', this book is full of authentic spy craft as well as action on every page. A new copy isn't available through Amazon, but it is worth whatever you pay for a used copy because you'll get your money's worth and then some!	2003-06-08

Unlike the main characters of some series who seem to be without fault, Dave Robicheaux is anything but. If you want to get a feel for who some of these characters are (Dave, Alafair, Batist, etc.), check out the movie \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" or just read the earlier books in the series. ... Burke's prose is masterful to put it simply and he gives you a real look into life in the bayou. Great book, fully recommended.	2003-05-09

Being a diehard West Virginia football fan, I'm tailored to not be too fond of the Syracuse Orangemen, but Tim Green is OK in my book! (Green was a former Orangemen football player) Some seem to see Kurt Ford as predictable and one-dimensional in this book, but I see those traits as DETERMINED and FOCUSED and I'm sure you will too while reading. I read this book in less than two days and I was enthralled by it. It is a true page turner and has movie written all over it (Jerry Bruckheimer stay away...we don't need explosions). All along you think you have it all figured out until Green throws a monkey wrench into it and it just makes you want to keep reading. First class job by Mr. Green!	2003-05-02

Even though the defendant Carl Lee Hailey clearly committed the crime, you find yourself rooting for his acquittal throughout the entire book. With the other storylines the Grisham works in (i.e. - the KKK vs. the African-American contingent, the attacks on Brigance, etc.), every page becomes crucial to the storyline. Grisham's language skills are near perfect and his style of writing keeps you reading and reading and reading...and before you know it you've burned up two and a half hours! I fully recommend this book. My first Grisham, but certainly not my last.<br />FREE CARL LEE!	2003-04-26

I'm not sure you could fit more action into a book with only 360+ pages. Morrell's flashback to the early childhood of the characters really adds to the overall story because it makes you feel how betrayed they really are. Once the book really gets rolling, you won't be able to put it down. This is the first book of David Morrell's that I have read, but it certainly won't be the last. It'll even make you want to go grab a Baby Ruth when you're done reading. Once you've read it, you'll understand why.	2003-02-15

This is the 5th book in the \\"Ryanverse\\" and this time an Israeli nuke is missing. A militant Arab terrorist group finds the missing nuke and reworks it into a usable weapon. At the end of Clear and Present Danger, J. Robert Fowler is elected President and he is in the Oval Office at the time of this story. It's clear that he and Ryan aren't too fond of each other and his National Security Advisor, Elizabeth Elliot (who is Fowler's personal Monica Lewinsky) flat out can't stand Jack. Elliot is one of those characters that you would like to choke if you had the ability, but that keeps you into the book. Certainly the nuclear bomb and the intended use of it is the main plot, but Clancy uses the secondary storyline (the President and Elliot trying to force Ryan out) to keep the pages turning. All in all, another classic Clancy. The final stages of the book are absolutely incredible, as has been the case with every Jack Ryan book I have read thus far. I'm sure the trend continues!	2003-02-02

The fact that the whole basis of this book is actually very possible makes you want to keep going and going as Clancy jumps from scene to scene, and interweaving all the storylines into one larger scheme. This book introduces the character Ding Chavez who appears sparingly during the series and, along with John Clark, is a main character in 'Rainbow Six'. If you have seen the movie, disregard it. While the movie was very good, the plot was changed drastically in comparison to the book. Some people don't seem to like Clancy's almost insane attention to detail, but it keeps me deep into the story...the more detail the better. Imagination only enhances the experience of a great book. At times you'll wonder why something is important, but before you know it it becomes abundantly clear. 'Patriot Games' is still not only my favorite in the series but also my favorite but all time. That being said, 'Clear and Present Danger' is another classic Clancy.	2003-01-29

Although we are introduced to Jack Ryan in Clancy's first novel &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;, this is actually the start of the Jack Ryan story. From the first few pages, you are drawn into a scene involving an attempted kidnapping of a member of the Royal Family which is thwarted by Ryan (of course). From there on out, the rising action keeps you from being able to put the book down. Pay attention to all the detail in the middle pages of the book because they merely set the scene for the final few chapters that are quite simply ACTION PACKED! If you've seen the movie, forget about it. The movie doesn't do the book justice. I've read many books, but this one remains my favorite and it will take a great one to take over the top spot.	2003-01-27
