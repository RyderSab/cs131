The characters are all quirky and loveable, and are all wounded in one way or another.  Their lives intertwine when 70-year old Margaret, a lonely rich woman living in a huge Seattle mansion, is diagnosed with a brain tumor.  She makes a decision about how to live out the short remainder of her life, which brings all of these wounded souls together as a surrogate family.   <br /> <br />One of these wounded souls, a young artist named Wanda, discovers the healing art of mosaic making.  Through Wanda we discover that these broken souls, like the valuable knick knacks that she breaks for use in her mosaics, are more interesting and beautiful broken than they were whole.  <br /> <br />A great read that stays with you long after you put it down.	2005-10-13

Boring characters with stupid names like Grigg and Allegra (the author even goes so far as to point out that she is named for a Shakespeare character, and not for the allergy medication) meet once a month to discuss their monthly Austen selection.  However, there is very little discussion of the chosen books.  Fowler sticks random quotes from or about Austen throughout the book in places where they don't make any sense.  She ends the book with a chapter summarizing all of the Austen novels, rather than weave this information into the story.  It's as if Fowler has collected all of this information on Austen and is determined to use it, even if she can't figure out how to do it in an interesting way.  'Look at me, I can quote Jane Austen.'  This book was so boring, I want my money and my time back.	2005-04-02

However, while it takes place in Victorian times, the language is not for sensitive types.  Prostitution is a major subject of the book, and is described in great detail. Faber has a nice writing style, with well-rounded characters, that make the 900-plus pages of this novel easy to read.

The reader is forewarned, as Atwood begins with this quote from Jonathan Swift in Gulliver's Travels:  &quot;I could perhaps have astonished you with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style; because my principal design was to inform you, and not to amuse you.&quot;  Thus, the novel is unlike any that Atwood has written before.  <br />Based on actual news clippings that the author has collected in the last few years, this is a futuristic novel about a world created by man's carelessness and greed.  A world of cloned animals, extreme makeovers, genetically engineered foods and people, where new diseases pop up faster than new medications and supplements.  <br />Atwood's sardonic wit and quick pacing make this novel hard to put down, and leave you thinking about it long after you've put it down.	2003-09-08

Still reveling in the self-pity and melodrama of a break-up with 'the monster' three years earlier, sophisticated New Yorker, Diana, is having trouble getting on with her life.  Her parents, along with her brother and his fiance, Laura, indulge her self-deprecation and assure her she is still lovable.  Then one day as her brother and parents are on their way to meet Laura's parents in New Jersey, they are killed in an accident with a drunk truck driver.  Diana's world is turned upside down and she sinks deeper and deeper into the depths of depression, quitting her job and laying around her apartment watching TV.<br />On a whim, and mostly to avoid the appointment her friends have arranged with a shrink, Diana gets in her Volvo and drives south until her car breaks down in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey.  There in the slower pace of the cranberry bogs, with the help of her quirky new friends, Diana discovers her hidden strength.<br />I enjoyed the snappy dialogue and visual descriptions of the cranberry bogs and farms in South Jersey.	2003-06-08

The characters in this writer's first work of fiction are true to life, full of passion, cynicism and biting social commentary.  When a conservative black judge is found dead, everyone assumes it was a heart attack.  But when the judge's son, conservative law professor Misha Garland, receives strange messages and notices someone following him, he's not so sure.  Carter ends each chapter with enough crumbs to keep you turning the pages for more clues, but keeps you guessing until the very end.  Well done!	2002-12-24

This would have made a better article for a woman's magazine.  There is not enough interesting material in this book to warrant 200+ pages.<br />I give it two stars:  The first for the one good piece of advice that Drescher offers her readers, which is that if you are in pain or you know something isn't right with your body, don't let any doctor tell you it's normal.  Get another opinion, and another, until you get to the cause of the problem.  You are your own best advocate for good medical care.  Aside from that important message, which can't be repeated often enough, there is virtually nothing inspirational about this book.  The second star is for the fact that I received my copy at a benefit to help cancer patients, at which Drescher was the guest speaker, so I applaud her efforts in that regard.<br />The rest of the book is all about how tough it is to receive good care when the whole world is blinded by your celebrity status.  Drescher offers more info on which celebrity friends she had lunch or dinner with before and after her various doctor's visits, who she traveled to Paris with after her show was canceled, etc., than she does on the actual cancer or any profound changes her illness brought about.  Despite telling us that her good friends Donna and Danny Aykroyd spend half their lives protecting their privacy, Drescher doesn't hesitate to mention them in practically every chapter of her book.  She chastises the press for the `feeding frenzy' that occurred when she and ex-husband Peter split up, and vows never to reveal such personal details of her life to the press again.  Then in the next chapters, she goes into much detail about her bowel movements and her sex life with her 26-year old boy toy.  One whole chapter is devoted to the death of her prescious 19-year old Pomeranian, Chester, and the endless search for a replacement dog--another Pomeranian in case you were wondering.  Unless you're still mourning the cancellation of 'The Nanny' I don't recommend buying this book.	2002-06-12

Out of the five Outlander books, this one took the longest for me to really sink my teeth into.  The first 169 pages all take place on the same day, at a gathering of the clans.  Gabaldon takes her time introducing us to the people and customs of 18th century North Carolina, including the various ways that bodily functions and fluids were handled before disposable paper goods.  Thankfully, the gathering eventually ends and the Fraser clan makes their way back up to the mountain ridge where life is much more interesting.<br />With the American Revolution on the horizon, Claire and Jamie and their growing family enjoy a quiet family life (and a little tragedy) while preparing for the war they know is coming.  Along with new friends and family members, there are of course new enemies as well as new time travelers.<br />While not my favorite of the series (that's a tie between Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber), I still enjoyed this book quite a bit and am anxiously awaiting the publication of book six.	2002-06-08

The fourth book in the Outlander series begins in 1769, as our favorite middle-aged couple, Scottish Highlander Jamie Fraser and his time-traveling bride Claire, begin a new life in the mountain wilderness of North Carolina.  Having traveled across the Atlantic, with a brief stop in the Caribbean, the two are ready to settle down and make a home of their own.  Meanwhile two hundred years back in the future, their daughter, Brianna, continues to frustrate her historian boyfriend, Roger, by refusing his marriage proposal.  Both Roger and Brianna are troubled by a newspaper clipping that spells disaster for her parents, and each secretly chooses to handle the news in their own way.<br />This installment of the Outlander saga takes some of the focus off of Jamie and Claire, and focuses more on Brianna and Roger, who aren't all that interesting at first glance.  We also meet some old friends and new enemies.  Unfortunately, it took almost 400 pages before I really got into this book, unlike the earlier three.  Of course, the good news is that I still had over 600 pages of excellent reading that I couldn't put down!  The last few pages were the best.  Now I am ready to dive into the fifth Outlander book, The Fiery Cross.	2002-05-05

Twenty years have passed since he sent her back through the stone circle to her own time to give birth to and raise their daughter, Brianna.  After tracking him down with the help of a historian, Claire travels back through the stone circle to 1768 Edinburgh and the timeless love affair continues.  <br />As usual though, trouble seems to follow these two and they are constantly on the run.  When Jamie's 15-year old nephew is kidnapped by a pirate ship, the two set sail for Jamaica to track him down.  They encounter one adventure after another--pirates, typhoid, slavers, witchcraft, voodoo, the Royal Navy--well, you get the picture.  <br />With over 1,000 pages to the paperback edition, Gabaldon sure gives you your money's worth!

Legend has it that the idyllic Three Sisters Island was formed in 1699 when three magical sisters cast a spell to save themselves from the Salem Witch Trials.  The circle of three caused a landmass to break off from the coast of Massachusetts and float out to sea, where the three witches lived and loved, albeit unhappily.  The legend states that three descendants of the original witches must unite one day to form the circle of three again and save the island from sinking into the sea.<br />Cut to the year 2000...on the run after faking her own drowning in California in order to escape her abusive husband, skittish Nell Channing has just arrived by ferry with nothing but her beat-up old Buick and $208.  She steps into the Book Café just in time to witness the chef hanging up her apron to head for the big city.  Desperate to fill the job and sensing a kinship with Nell, owner and local good witch Mia Devlin offers Nell the position, along with a rental cottage near the beach.  Soon everyone on the island is coming in for lunch to check out the new chef and sample her culinary magic.  Lovable local hero, Sheriff Zack Todd, makes the Book Café a regular stop on his rounds too.  Sensing that Nell's on the run from something or someone, he makes excuses to keep bumping into her.  Zack's feisty sister and deputy sheriff, Ripley, is the reluctant third witch in the trio.  Ripley and Mia were childhood friends, but grew apart when Ripley decided to deny her obvious magical powers.  <br />I enjoyed reading this book and will definitely read the second and third books in the trilogy.  Roberts has created lovable characters that you can't help but root for as they become friends, fall in love, find their self-esteem, claim their magical powers, and fight evil.  While `Dance Upon the Air' is Nell's story, the second and third installments of the trilogy will feature Mia's and Ripley's stories.  My favorite of the three is Mia, a strong, confident business owner who anyone would love to have as a friend.  I can't wait to read her story.	2002-02-05

The second installment of the Three Sisters Island trilogy continues the story of three modern witches--Ripley, Mia and Nell.  This one focuses on Ripley's struggles with her magical powers and her growing interest in a visiting scientist whose interests in her magic are not entirely academic.<br />The legend of the island states that the three 'sisters' must unite to prevent the island from sinking into the depths of the sea.  Sheriff's deputy, Ripley Todd, wants no part in this 'crapola' and believes the gun in her holster is all the magic she needs to fight evil.  But, only by learning to control her emotions as well as her magical powers, can Ripley fight the evil that threatens to destroy all she holds dear.  If she can't control her need for vengeance, she is doomed to repeat the mistakes of her ancestors and doom the island to a horrible fate.<br />This was a quick, fun follow-up to Dance Upon the Air.  However, I agree with another reviewer who said that it wouldn't stand alone without being part of a trilogy.  Maybe because Ripley is the least likable of the three witches?  Or maybe I just found the idea of Ripley flying a little too hard to believe.  Mia's story will wrap up the trilogy.  She is the strongest, most likable of the three.  Hopefully Roberts has saved the best for last!	2002-02-05

This second action-packed installment in the Outlander series continues the saga of Jamie and Claire Fraser, and is full of historical details.  The story begins in 1968, as Claire returns to Scotland with her 20-year old daughter Brianna, hoping to find out what happened to Jamie and his troops after he sent her back through the circle of stones to the 20th century.  As Claire reveals the truth of her past to a reluctant Brianna and researcher Roger Wakefield, we are treated to more twists and turns in the adventures with Jamie and Claire.  The pair live in France for a while, and later return to Scotland, as they attempt to thwart the return of Bonnie Prince Charles to Scotland and the impending doom he'll bring with the uprising of 1745.  <br />The book is packed with one adventure after another, taking reaaders on an emotional roller coaster ride.  Readers searching for a lighthearted romance may be offended by the graphic violence or sexual content.  Personally, I couldn't get enough.  I stayed up until 3:30 a.m. reading, slept a few hours, and immediately picked it up and started reading it again when I woke up!  I can't wait to read Voyager!	2002-01-31

It definitely surpasses the hype!<br />It's 1945, and having been separated throughout most of their eight-year marriage due to their respective WWII duties as nurse and intelligence officer, Claire and Frank Randall are enjoying a second honeymoon in the Scottish Highlands before he begins his new post as a history professor at Oxford.    Frank, a Jacobite historian, spends his leisure time exploring old documents and ghost stories with the local vicar, while Claire, an amateur botanist, gathers wildflowers in the surrounding fields.  Fascinated by her discovery of a miniature Stonehenge at Craigh Na Dun, Claire returns one morning with Frank, where to their mutual delight they secretly witness some of the local women performing a ritual dance among the circle of stones.  The next day, as Frank busies himself with the genealogy of his English ancestors, Claire returns to the stones to gather some rare plants.  She hears a strange vibrating beehive-like sound coming from one of the stones.  When she places her hand on the stone, she is instantly sucked through a crack in time back to 1743.<br />Found wandering the eighteenth-century hillside in suspicious clothing, Claire is captured by an English dragoon captain who suspects her of being either a spy for the Scots or a prostitute.  Thinking the second more likely, he decides to find out for himself.  Suddenly they are attacked, and Claire is snatched from the randy Redcoat by a red-haired Scottish outlaw who rides off with her into the night with his clansmen.<br />The Scots can't decide if she is a spy for the English or French, but can't risk letting her go.  They take her back with them to Castle Leoch, land of theMacKenzie clan, where her nursing skills prove useful and she is given the job of Healer.  She strikes up a friendship with a frequent patient--horse trainer Jamie Fraser, the Scottish outlaw who rescued her from the ruthless English dragoon Captain Jack Randall.<br />Wanted for questioning by the English, and not quite trusted by the MacKenzie clan, Claire agrees to a marriage of convenience with Jamie.  Since the English cannot storm the castle and forcefully remove a resident from Scottish territory, she knows this is her best chance for survival until she can get back to the stones and return to her life with Frank.  To assure that the marriage will not be challenged, Jamie and Claire are under strict orders to consummate their vows as soon as possible.  And thus begins a physical, spiritual and emotional bond unlike any other, leaving Claire torn between two different centuries and two very different husbands.<br />Outlander takes you on a thrilling historical adventure, filled with sensuality and gut wrenching, blood, sweat and tear-filled emotional upheavals.  I could not put this book down!  The characters are strong and gutsy.  Claire is one tough woman with a vocabulary to match!  Jamie is a big, fierce Highlander who vows he'd fight to the death to protect his new bride.<br />I have one minor complaint about the book.  It bothered me that at first Claire didn't seem too upset about being torn from her husband and everything she held dear.  She seemed to adjust to her new surroundings a little too quickly.  Gabaldon deals with this later in the book, but it seemed almost as if she wrote it in later as an afterthought.  However, that did not detract in the least from my enjoyment of this book.<br />If you have not read this book yet, you must read it immediately.  Do yourself a favor and buy all five books in advance--once you finish this one you'll be anxious to devour the entire series.	2002-01-03
US	52501148	RS0SD7R7UNWX4	0515131741	40814111	Lost and Found	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Lukewarm romantic suspense.	Cady Briggs's expert eye for European arts and antiques is one of several traits she shares with her Great Aunt Vespa, owner of Gallery Chatelaine.  Semi-retired Vespa would love for Cady to take over the gallery, but Cady's not interested.  She'd rather freelance as a consultant, and leave the business of running the gallery to her cousin, Sylvia.  Sylvia has big plans for the gallery, including a merger with their biggest competitor, Austrey-Post.<br />Mack Easton is a widower whose company, Lost and Found, investigates and recovers stolen art and antiques.  He hires Cady through the internet, and they communicate only by phone and e-mail for the first couple of jobs.  Sparks fly when the two finally meet in Las Vegas at a client's business location, after Mack hires Cady to help trace a stolen 16th-century armor helmet.  Days later, after a rescue and a first kiss, Mack leaps over a motel balcony to sweep Cady off to the bedroom.  The ecstasy is short-lived though, as the two are soon arguing.<br />When Vespa is found dead in her swimming pool, everyone assumes she's suffered one of her panic attacks and drowned.  Cady, who suffers panic attacks herself, isn't so sure.  Her suspicions are compounded by a recent change in Vespa's will.  She's left a controlling block of Chatelaine's shares to Cady, despite knowing that Cady doesn't want them.  Around the time she changed her will, Vespa also had a last minute change of heart about the proposed merger.  Cady hires Mack to help prove that Vespa's death was no accident.  Things get cozy when they move into Vespa's San Francisco Bay-area villa, posing as a pre-engaged couple for cover.<br />Vespa wasn't known for her warmth, and there's no shortage of suspects.  There's Jonathan Arden, a con-artist posing as an antiques psychic to swindle elderly clients out of their cash.  Then there's Randall Post, Cady's ex-husband, who's desperate to gain control of the merged galleries.  Stanford Felgrove, Randall's slimy stepfather, is also a good candidate.  Then there's Brooke Langworth, Randall's ex-girlfriend.  She broke his heart years ago when she married and older man with money.  Now that her husband is dying, she'd do anything to help Randall gain control of the family fortune.<br />This is the first book I've read by Krentz, and my expectations were high based on the recommendations of other readers.  I was disappointed.  The pace was slow in the beginning, but it picked up about a third of the way through.  It also took a while to get to like and care about the main characters, but they grew on me eventually.<br />The romance was warm and believable.  If there had been more of it, this may have been a more likeable book.	2001-11-24

Although this novel has elements of a great story, including good writing, good story and characters you grow to love and care about, there was just something missing.  A good editor, maybe?  <br />The story begins with Ruth, a 40-something ghost writer whose love life is less than perfect, and whose mother is showing signs of Alzheimer's Disease.  Mother-daughter conflicts and painful memories on both sides have their roots in long-buried family secrets.  Until the secrets of the past are unearthed, neither woman is able to love herself or others fully.  The story really slows down in the middle, when the mother relives her childhood in China, and reading it becomes more like homework than pleasure.<br />Buy the paperback, or better yet, check it out of the library.	2001-11-05

He loved it so much he immediately went to the bookstore to buy the second and third books in this trilogy.  I had never heard of the book or the author, nor was I interested in the life of Josephine Bonaparte, but his enthusiastic praise was enough of an endorsement for me.  <br />He was right.  This is a book you will lose yourself in.  Sandra Gulland has done an enormous amount of research on her subject, Josephine Bonaparte, a.k.a. Rose.  It is very entertaining, as well as educational.  Gulland's Josephine is a classy, gracious diplomat who helped shape history.  When faced with a dilemma after reading this book, you will find yourself asking &quot;What would Josephine do?&quot;  The book is written in diary format, and spans the time from Josephine/Rose's adolescence in Martinique, through the French Revolution, and up until the beginning of her relationship with Napoleon.  Each chapter leaves you eager for the next one, and growing more and more fond of Josephine along the way.	2001-10-30

I felt as if the author had been eavesdropping in my house and heard the shouting matches between me and my daughter.  He helped me to understand what was really going on between us and that this is a normal stage of development.  I feel that our communication has already improved somewhat.

She is an excellent writer, and one of my favorite contemporary authors. However...'Disobedience' was more of a Disappointment for me. The story begins when 17-year old Henry, the family computer expert, logs onto his mother's e-mail account and discovers that she's having an affair. An adult Henry narrates several years later, recounting family life during the year of the affair. This narrative just didn't ring true for me. It read more like a 40 year old woman's version of a 17-year old boy. What male, 17 or otherwise, uses terms like 'feminine rage'? The characters were one-dimensional, the story rambled, and the 'climactic ending' was flat.	2001-08-27

I received a complimentary book club edition of AHWOSG and avoided reading it for the longest time.  What with the title and the little drawings and the flow chart, I was certain I would hate it.  I was wrong!<br />Dave Eggers has a conversational tongue-in-cheek writing style that is brutally honest, often hilarious, and yes, at times, heartbreaking genius.  Many of the reviewers below stated that this book would only be interesting to those under 30.  I disagree (even though by Dave's standards I myself am old--41).  You don't have to be a certain age to understand the sorrow and anger Dave feels over losing both parents, or the fear all 'parents' go through when leaving their child with a babysitter for the first time.  You don't have to be a fan of 'Real World' to understand that a 22-year old man was trying desperately to relate to people his own age, despite feeling older than most of them.<br />This is not just a 'tragedy-of-the-week' story.  Dave has a neurotic, analytical way of looking at everything.  He is a truly gifted writer, and I look forward to reading more of his work in the future.	2001-06-20

Readers of this book will wonder how first-time novelist Wally Lamb managed to do such an amazing job of writing in the voice of a woman.  <br />Dolores Price is a character that will stay with you forever.  Dolores learns at an early age that television and junk food are more nurturing than most of the adults in her life.  Beginning with her parents divorce while she is still quite young, Dolores copes with a series of tragic events by binging in front of the TV.  By the time she enters college, she weighs over 260 pounds and is suicidal.  She decides to end it all by driving to Cape Cod to commune with a beached whale that is dying there.  Throughout her pain, Dolores keeps a wisecracking sense of humor that keeps the novel from getting too depressing.  You will laugh and cry along with this lovable, unforgettable character as she finds her place in the world.	2001-06-08

Grisham has written believable, flawed characters in the racist old Southerner convicted of planting a deadly bomb in a Jewish lawyer's office 30 years earlier, and the idealistic young attorney fighting for a stay of execution.  <br />My husband and I listened to the audio version while driving through the Utah desert.  When we arrived at our hotel, after an 8-hour drive, we didn't want to get out of the car because we would have to stop the tape!  I've also read the book.

Those who prefer happily-ever-after stories seem to hate it.  I loved it for the author's excellent writing.  Alice is an ordinary, stressed-out wife and mother living on a mid-western dairy farm with her ordinary husband, Howard, and their two young daughters.  Alice works as a school nurse at an elementary school, while Howard tends to the Golden Guernseys.  Like all couples, they have their ups and downs.<br />When a tragic accident occurs, Alice and her family take center stage as the drama unfolds in their rural community.  This tragedy, as well as the community's reaction to it, sets off a chain of events that will forever alter the lives of Alice and Howard.  <br />The extraordinary thing about this book is the narrative, which alternates between Alice's point of view and Howard's.  Using this technique, Hamilton paints an intimate portrait of a marriage under strain, and the couple's very different perspectives about what happened.<br />I've also read Hamilton's 'The Book of Ruth.'  I liked this one much more.	2001-06-08

Wounded and disillusioned, confederate soldier Inman abandons the Civil War and begins the long walk back toward his home on Cold Mountain and Ada, the woman he loves.  Both Ada and Inman are on a journey of sorts.<br />First-time novelist Charles Frazier alternates the narrative points of view between the two sweethearts, illustrating the deep love each has for the other, as well as for their mountain home in North Carolina.<br />Inman meets an odd assortment of criminals, gypsies, vigilante home guards, and Good Samaritans along his route, as well as cold, hunger and exhaustion.  Ada, who has until now enjoyed the fruits of a privileged upbringing, is left alone on her farm after her father's death.  Her journey involves learning to grow up and run the farm.  Throughout their ordeals, the love these two have for each other, along with a love of their homeland, becomes their sole reason for staying alive.<br />Frazier has a subtle, understated writing style that let's you put the pieces together for yourself.  He based this story on the lives of his ancestors.  I eagerly await more from this talented writer.	2001-06-08

This book was so good, I've had a hard time enjoying any other book since I read it.  The writing is fantastic!<br />This story is about a missionary family that travels to the Congo during the late 50s and early 60s, to spread the word of God to the natives.  The narrative alternates between the mother and four daughters, which keeps it very interesting.  How does Kingsolver manage to write in 5 voices that are so very different?<br />The family arrives in Africa with all of their 'worldly' possessions--Betty Crocker cake mixes and all, and immediately set about showing the natives the proper way to get things done.  As the story progresses towards an overthrow of the government, a powershift within the American family takes place as well.  The Congo, as well as the missionary family, will be forever changed.  <br />If you enjoy writing that contains an excellent narrative, lots of historical research, and layers of symbolic meaning, you will really appreciate this book.	2001-06-02
US	52501148	R2DSAY1IBGDFNZ	0375701923	29396825	MotherKind: A Novel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Nicely written.	Phillips' writing just flows easily from one chapter to the next. In this semi-autobiographical novel, Phillips illustrates the bond between a mother and daughter from birth to death, and the various ways in which all women become nurturers. Kate discovers she's pregnant shortly after her own mother, Katherine, is diagnosed with a serious illness. Katherine leaves her home in Pennsylvania and moves in with Kate and her boyfriend in Boston. Kate's life is turned upside down as she becomes her mother's caretaker, a stepmother to two boys, then gives birth to her own child and needs some care of her own. Through flashbacks, we meet all of the female caretakers that come in and out of the women's lives--the young woman who comes in to prepare meals until the new mother gets back on her feet, the babysitter, the next-door neighbor who offers her own brand of nurturing, and the visiting nurses who help her mother through the last painful days of her life. My only complaint is that the male characters are minor characters with no substance. Obviously, Phillips had her reasons for writing them that way, but as someone who was nursed back to health by a husband after a serious illness, it bugged me that all of the nurturers in the book are women. Aside from that, it was a good read.	2001-06-02

I avoided this one for a long time, in part because of the subject matter, and in part because it's so darn long.  After reading Lamb's first novel 'She's Come Undone' and loving it, I thought I'd give this one a try.  I didn't like it as much, but it was still pretty good.  It is very well-written, so the length is not a problem once you get into it.<br />This story follows the relationship between twin brothers--one is schizophrenic and the other one isn't.  Lamb is a talented author.  He uses flashbacks and alternating time periods to unfold the relationship between the brothers.  The characters are very real, and very memorable.<br />I'm glad I finally got around to reading this one.	2001-06-02

The Poisonwood Bible was my first exposure to Barbara Kingsolver, and immediately after reading it I decided she was now my favorite author.  I then read everything else she had written before Poisonwood and was not disappointed.  So it was with great anticipation that I purchased this novel and settled down to read it.<br />What a chore that was.  ZZzzzzzzz.  While her past novels all had important messages on the environment, racism, materialism, etc. woven into them, Kingsolver's earlier stories were engaging, with strong believable characters.  No one could fault the author for her passionate views.  However, while reading Prodigal Summer, I felt like I was being force fed a lesson on the ecosystem--thinly disguised as a novel.  Throw in a few sex scenes and maybe the readers won't realize they're being preached to about organic farming, save the bugs, save the coyotes, save the snakes, blah, blah, blah. I wanted a novel, not a science book.	2000-12-18

Poisonwood Bible is my first exposure to this author, and I thought it was one of the best books I'd ever read.  But...I had a hard time getting into this one. In the beginning the book jumps back and forth between past and present, as well as from different points of view. This worked very well in Poisonwood Bible, but was harder to follow in Animal Dreams.<br />Second, the protagonist--Codi Noline, is really not all that likable at the beginning of the story. It's only when you get about half way through the book, if you've managed to hang in there that long, that you learn why she's the way she is and hope for her to change. Ultimately, the growth of this character and others made the novel enjoyable for me in the end. The second half was much better and more emotionally fulfilling. I'm glad I stuck with it.	2000-11-16

WWII has just ended and 25-year old Laura Chase has just driven off a bridge. Atwood then immediately takes us to Laura's sci-fi novel 'Blind Assassin,' published posthumously in 1947. As the novel within the novel unfolds, so too do the stories of Iris and Laura, WWI &amp; WWII, the labor movement, 1930's Toronto high society and much more.  Mystery, sci-fi and romance all wrapped up in one fantastic novel.<br />Atwood leaves a trail of crumbs that keep the reader hungry for more. I couldn't put it down. I must warn you though, if you're looking for a book that will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy, this isn't the one. I've been in a gloomy mood since finishing it this morning. But, if you appreciate fine writing that leaves you thinking about life and human nature long after you've finished it, then you'll want to read Blind Assassin.	2000-09-18

Smiley obviously spent a lot of time researching the conflict between the abolitionists and the pro-slavers in 1855 Kansas Territory.  Lidie's  action-packed adventures kept me reading till the wee hours. Lidie is a  strong female role model, not content to stay in the kitchen.  <br />Though it  is set in the 19th century, this novel parallels contemporary idealogical  issues in which each side cites the Bible to defend their position.<br />I  can't wait to read more from Smiley.	1999-05-09

While there, she relives her  childhood memories through a series of flashbacks.  Through these memories  she comes to understand herself and her work much better.

Pearl Cleage sure has a way with words. The narration, dialogue and characters are so real, I felt as if I were right there in the story with them. Cleage has a humorous narrative style that can tell a serious story in a refreshingly funny way.  Ava's story is truly inspirational, and reminds us of what is truly important in life. I had never read any of Cleage's work before. After Oprah recommended this book, I checked out the synopsis and reviews at [...] and liked what I saw. I'm glad I discovered another author to add to my list of favorites.	1998-10-28

Too much  information that adds nothing to the story.  Although I found myself  wanting to read the entire novel through to the end, some chapters put me  to sleep.	1998-09-23

I'm not sure  which one of us enjoyed it more.  We both looked forward to our reading  time in the evenings when we would find out what latest adventure awaited  con-artist Tom and his friends, Huck, Becky &amp; Joe.  It also provided a  wonderful opportunity to discuss racism.  I highly recommend this book to  readers of all ages.	1998-09-05
