US	52808871	R27HL2JK6EZ836	0752833804	554228601	Rowan Atkinson	Books	3	12	14	N	N	Eh	Something of a lesson in not judging a book by its cover (or the blurb on the back).  After purchasing this book, I was disappointed to learn in the opening acknowledgements that this was an unauthorized biography and that not even one of Atkinson's friends or close business associates agreed to be interviewed by Bruce Dressau, which in my mind, somewhat discredits the biography.  On the other hand, if you're an American who didn't stumble upon Blackadder until it began airing on public television in the 90's (the way I did), this book isn't a bad read.  It closely follows his career from his Oxford days up through The Thin Blue Line, which was interesting, especially when you see that seeds of certain characters (particularly Mr. Bean) took root early on in his career.  Other than that, though, don't expect to gain any insight as to Rowan Atkinson the man, because there isn't any.  The author tries to draw parallels between things like Atkinson's love of cars and his performing (if I had the book by my side now I'd subject you to the metaphor)but they just don't fly.  I also realized, after reading the book, that the numerous articles that he quotes from (since no one was willing to talk to him) are mostly available on the internet.  So while I'm willing to say that I learned something about British comedy and Rowan Atkinson, in the end I was still disappointed.	2001-08-31

If you enjoy satire, and you like it laced with sexual innuendo, profanity and wit, you will love Tom Sharpe's books, but you will particularly love Wilt, which takes you into the world and never-ending irony of lower-class British academia. Henry Wilt is miserable in his existence as a \\"Tech\\" lecturer, married to Eva, his incorrigibly energetic, enthusiastic and critical wife. He attempts to escape by way of fantasizing how he might murder Eva, who has recently taken up with the sexually wacky American couple next door. After an embarrassing encounter with an inflatable doll, Wilt decides to practice murder on it, and ends up being accused of murdering Eva. A fantastic read.	2001-08-31

I tend to like it when authors take traditional stories with famous protagonists and tell it all from another point of view (recent examples include The Red Tent, The History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters).  This book is no exception.  In fact, it's intriguing because it shows that even in &quot;fairy tales&quot;, things are not necessarily black and white.  There isn't a good guy or a bad guy...just lots of grey folks in between (notice that the title is Confessions of an *Ugly* Stepsister, not a wicked one).  Whole people, with virtues as well as faults.  You end up having sympathy for just about every character in this tale.  I think I'll be reading Wicked real soon.	2001-07-07

The characters, particularly Sayuri, are some of the most compelling, from Hatsumomo, the cruel geisha who jealously guards her position, to Mameha, the geisha who decides to help Sayuri.  I also learned a lot about the geisha culture - all the more interesting because the reader is learning about it alongside Sayuri.  If you like to read because reading is a form of escape into another world, this is definitely a book you should pick up.	2001-07-01

This book kept me up at night and almost made me miss my train stop twice (the true measure of a really good book).  What a great idea, telling the story of a minor Biblical character.

Strangely, I didn't read all these books until I was in my twenties.  I had read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe when I was younger, but I guess I just never got into it, back then.  Now I love fantasy novels, and there's an extra level of appreciation as an adult with the Narnia series, since you have a better understanding of C.S. Lewis' background as a Christian scholar (for the record, I'm not Christian, and found this aspect fascinating). It also makes you think twice when you see a random squirrel scamper by.	2001-07-01

Troy Alleyn has been commissioned to paint Hilary (a man)  Bill-Tasman's portrait during the Christmas holiday.  While she knows that  he's eccentric, she doesn't count on the fact that he likes to staff his  house with ex-convicts (&quot;onecers&quot;)from the local prison.  When  their crimes start repeating themselves in the great house and a missing  person turns up dead, Inspector Alleyn is unwillingly pulled into the  picture, taking charge of the investigation.

It's time for the men of the Andersen clan to re-enact the annual Dance of  the Five Swords.  Don't let the fact that they unite every year for this  tradition fool you into thinking that this is a peaceful family - All of  the Andersen men chafe under the rule of their father/grandfather, William  Andersen (AKA &quot;The Guiser&quot;) who has held a tight fist over the  family smithy and cash, not to mention every single member of his family,  especially Ernie the &quot;slow&quot; one.  There are also others in the  village who manage to antagonize each other.  Still, the last thing anyone  expects is for one of the dancers to die in a gruesome manner, mid-dance.

Troy decides to take a breather after her London art show and sees that  there is a last minute cancellation on a mini-cruise.  She signs up for it,  and realizes, shortly into the trip, that she may be on bored with a famous  international criminal - one wanted for murder.  But which one of her  fellow passengers is &quot;The Jampot&quot;?  Alleyn himself is in the  States on business, so a good deal of the information is first learned  through Troy's letters to him (an interesting change, since we usually see  Alleyn's letters to Troy).  But as he becomes more and more alarmed by her  reports, he returns to try and catch the Jampot before yet another murder  is committed.	2000-08-21

I remembered seeing advertisements  for the movie version a few years ago, then forgot about it completely.   Somehow, I ended up buying this book, just remembering how much one of my  college roommates loved it, and find that I feel the same way.  It is a  wonderful book about a little girl who is more than just a prodigy at math  and reading...she's almost like a kind old soul in a little girl's body.   The way she temporarily escapes her mundane existence with the most  annoying, awful parents there are reminds me of how I used to be a  voracious reader, when I was young (not that I had awful parents, but I  didn't particularly care for the school I went to).  The book _Matilda_  provides a similar escape - suddenly, you're no longer in a small,  overcrowded airport, waiting for your plane that's been delayed an hour.   You're in the classroom of an English village, watching Matilda stun her  teacher by doing complex calculations, and using that wonderful brain of  hers to seek revenge on the horrible Miss Trunchbull, headmistress/ogre of  the school.  A brilliant book - one I would particularly recommend giving  to a child who all too often feels powerless.	2000-08-13

The friend who loaned me this book did, and could not relax the entire  time.  Pretty understandable, when the premise of the novel is that there  is a notorious serial killer on board a cruise ship who has an obsession  with women, costume jewelry and hyacinths.  Marsh's characters are all  very-well drawn (at one point I almost wanted to kick the ship's captain)  and the plot is flawless, with an interesting psychological angle to it.	2000-08-11

Cutting dryer sheets in half, re-using  ziploc bags, alternatives to regular gift-wrap, recipes, etc.   Unfortunately, the book is organized chronologically (i.e., earliest issues  of the Tightwad Gazette to the most recent)so you have to go through it  page by page and dog-ear or mark the things that you find useful.  There is  an index, but I found it unhelpful, as many tips come under the heading  they were published, rather than the category it falls under (and most of  the headings are punny and cute, so it doesn't help that much).  You just  have to dive in and decide how frugal you want to be.  For example, I have  no interest in constructing a volleyball net out of old plastic soda can  rings, but I really liked her take-it-with-you lunch suggestions (yeah,  they were for kids lunches, but can easily be applied to adults).  As the  author herself points out, she had to go to the extremes of frugality  because she is in a one-income family with six children.  Depending on  where you are and where you would like to be, financially, you take advice  with a grain of salt.  And hey, sometimes it's just fun getting so much  more for less!	2000-08-11

I should probably read a bio on Ngaio Marsh, because I'm interested in  knowing if she lived on a sheep farm when growing up in New Zealand - she  seems to know an awful lot about wool!  At any rate, this is another  classic Marsh novel, though I do still miss Fox and co., as is the case  with all the Inspector Alleyn novels set in New Zealand.  Alleyn is  performing War duty for the Special Services branch, when he responds to a  call from a house where a Member of Parliament has been found murdered by  being encased in a bale of wool on her own sheep farm.  While there are  household jealousies and inheritances, there is also a question of secret  machinery plans being stolen and given to the enemy.  As usual, the  characters are finely drawn, and the plot superb (not to mention a bit  bizarre!).	2000-08-07

Though thanks to journalist/friend Nigel Bathgate she has some idea of what's in store for her, nothing fully prepares her for the  amount of in-fighting, jealousy and histrionics the Ancred family can  provide.  Against this backdrop, Troy is reunited with her husband,  Inspector Alleyn, who has been away on CID business for a couple of years.   This book is one of the more interesting novels, in that: A) You get to see  the beginning of the mystery from Troy's point of view.  B)Marsh really  knows how to write about awkward reunions  and C) You get to see something  of the artist's process (not surprising, I suppose, since Marsh herself  painted).  Another good read by Marsh.	2000-07-27

I won't go into the plot too much, since I hate it when people spoil books  for those who haven't read them yet.  But I must say that the reason I love  this series so much, is that while the world that Harry and his friends  inhabit is magical, the people are REAL.  The reason that this book is  scarier, sadder and more complicated, is because the characters are growing  older, and that's what happens when you grow older:  you realize how much  more complicated life gets, and how, when it comes to a person's character,  there are an awful lot of shades of grey, rather than just black and white.  Nothing and no one is as clear-cut as it first appeared, and never will be  again.	2000-07-12

Suddenly, those closest to Mary - her adopted son,  devoted husband, faithful maid, old nanny, personal stylist/designer, old  admirer and theatre colleagues are suspected of murder.

The only things he can move are his neck (about 90 degrees) and his left  eyelid.  Using his eyelid, a computer device and an assistant, he dictates  this entire memoir, that talks about how he misses simple things, like  being able to stroke his son's hair, or the taste of a meal that he's  cooked for himself.  He has to mentally go to the various places he  travelled to before the syndrome, in order to keep from going crazy, a  working brain locked in an inactive body.  While the book is depressing,  it's surprising how uplifting it is, in a way.  Makes you realize how much  about life you take for granted.	2000-07-05

A good read, but I miss the comraderie and banter that goes on between Inspectors Alleyn and Fox, as well as the fingerprint and photography experts, Bailey and Thompson.  It's strange, because I didn't feel the same  way about _When in Rome_, where Alleyn is traveling outside of England, and  therefore is without his usual force.  Anyway, it's still a good read.   Once again, the theatre becomes the stage for a murder, when a carefully  timed birthday gag goes wrong and ends up killing someone who doesn't seem  to have an enemy in the world.  Taking place in New Zealand, Marsh gives  the reader a good introduction to her native country.	2000-07-05

I don't know, usually, as I've said in previous reviews of Marsh's mysteries, even the ones that don't seem to be as good prove at least satisfying. Here, this doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe I was just slow, but the plot really didn't seem to run as smoothly as it usually does in her books, which is a shame since the characters are quite well-drawn. A wealthy widow commits suicide at a well-known spa/health hotel. Did she do it because she was angry with her daughter or because she suspected that she herself may have an incurable disease? The question soon becomes, did she commit suicide at all? It's up to Detective Inspector Alleyn and his trusty side-kick, Inspector Fox, to get to the bottom of this grave.	2000-06-29

Overture to Death is Marsh's best for a few reasons:  1) The background of the murder (English village life) is extremely well drawn.  2)  The characters are so well-defined, you feel as if you know them.  3) The  method of murder is the cleverest I've seen yet, from Dame Marsh, and is  completely plausible.  One of the reasons that people look down on mystery  novels, is that often they are about plot with scant attention paid to the  literary aspects.  Not so with Ngaio Marsh.	2000-06-28

A throw-back to happier times, they are typical, impoverished English peers, through whose fingers money slips like water.  They generally don't worry though, since something always  comes through and saves them from their latest financial crisis.  This  time, though, they might be in trouble, if Uncle G., Lord Charles Lamprey's  wealthy older brother, decides not to come to their financial rescue.  As  it happens, he's had enough of pulling the Lamprey fat out of the fire.   The Lampreys think they're finished when Uncle G. is murdered in the  ghastliest manner, and they gain their inheritance, narrowly averting a  financial scandal.  The only problem is, did one of them do it?  So of  course, Inspector Alleyn steps in to get to the bottom of the crime. While  I am a general fan of Ngaio Marsh, I think that this is one of her better  novels, as she draws a very vivid picture of the large Lamprey family, seen  through the eyes of their friend, Roberta Grey.  She successfully mixes the  aristocracy with witchcraft, facts about New Zealand, and introduces us to  a young version of P.C. Lamprey (a minor character that you meet in other  novels, chiefly, _Night at the Vulcan_).  All in all, an excellent  whodunit.	2000-06-26

With a group of people unable to stand  each other staying in a house during a snowstorm, the inevitable occurs,  namely, murder. While I almost always enjoy the plot, writing style, etc.,  of Ngaio Marsh, I really love Chief Inspector Alleyn.  Therefore, I was  disappointed when he didn't appear until the last third of this book.  Yes,  he solves the murder, but you don't really get to see him interacting very  much with the other characters, which is part of the charm of these novels.	2000-06-26

But then again, it's all a case of life imitating art, and no one does this better than Ngaio Marsh. It's not surprising when you realize that she was a stage director/producer in New Zealand. _Night at the Vulcan_ beautifully captures the atmosphere unique to the theatre, while laying out a very clever case of murder made to look like suicide. This is all told through the eyes of Martyn Tarne, a young lady newly arrived to the London theatre scene, making it all the more interesting. The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, was that the identity of the murderer became a little too obvious, in my opinion, but all in all, a fantastic read.	2000-06-23

I particularly liked the fact that Detective-Inspector Fox was given more stage-time.  However, while I find the motive for the murder perfectly  plausible, I'm not so sure I believe in the efficacy of the method.  The  plot is similar to _Enter a Murderer_, in that what is supposed to be a  joke or &quot;staged&quot; murder, turns out to be the real thing, in front  of a dozen witnesses.  Still, even though this set-up is similar, Marsh  populates the novel with an altogether different cast of people.  The only  thing I wish is that when the book ended, it would give the reader a clue  as to what happens to the various characters, and not just reveal who the  murderer is.	2000-06-19

Neither of them seemed to have any kind of personal life (except of course, Watson and brother Mycroft for Holmes and Hastings for Poirot). No family, friends, love interests (though people have speculated on the Holmes/Watson connection)or any kind of emotional life. Inspector Alleyn is of a different breed. Yes, he's a professional, but he also has a personality outside of being &quot;the Handsome Super,&quot; as the newspapers like to call him. As does his faithful sidekick, Inspector Fox, who, though not as clever as Alleyn shows a level of intelligence well above that of Hastings or Watson. In _Hand in Glove_ Marsh sets a murder against the backdrop of a village primarily occupied by the nobility. Indeed, no one would even dream of murder tainting the house where Messrs.Pyke Period and Henry Cartell live. But when one of them ends up having his skull crushed and multiple motives come to light, it is up to Inspector Alleyn to point the finger at the guilty party. This is probably the most skillfully woven Marsh mystery I have read to date.	2000-06-16

Now, reading my fourth Marsh novel, _When in Rome_, I can say that I like her even better than Agatha Christie.  _When in Rome_ is about a  group of tourists (incl. the famous Inspector Alleyn) whose guide suddenly  disappears.  Only Inspector Alleyn, who joined the tour because he suspects  that the guide is a key member of a drug ring, is worried about his  disappearance;  most of the tour group couldn't care less.  In fact, a few  of them couldn't be happier that the seedy Mr. Mailer has conveniently  vanished.	2000-06-13

If I hadn't first read _Death at the Bar_ this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, as both plots are rather clever - it's  just unfortunate that they're clever in the same way.  I also didn't like  Inspector Alleyn as much in this book - granted he was investigating a  murder that takes place amongst theatrical people, but still, he came off  as a bit overdone at times. At any rate, _Enter a Murderer_ was quite  entertaining - Marsh definitely starts to plumb the depths in terms of a  murderer's psychology, and the whole set up, with the murder taking place  on stage in full-view of an audience (talk about witnesses!) was a really  neat idea.	2000-06-12

The characters were well-drawn, and the plot quite brilliant.  A man dies while  playing darts, because it appears that a dart daubed with cyanide sticks in  the back of his hand.  Almost everyone has a motive, and the evidence at  hand can point to almost any of them.  Reading this novel is like threading  a conch-shell.  You slip in a piece of string and it snakes through various  chambers and entries until it finally comes out at the end.  I was a big  Christie fan, but now I think I'll be moving on to Marsh.	2000-05-31

I'm 25, and I wish these books had been around when I was a kid, but I think I'm enjoying them now even more.  The writing is perfect - witty, clever, understandable, and the book is a page-turner.  You really care  about the characters...you root for Harry, Hermione and Ron, and boo and  hiss at Draco.	1999-06-30

Lamott uses her experiences as a writer, a teacher of writing, a mother and a human being to illustrate the various aspects of writing.  Not only does Lamott cover the  turf we're used to seeing in books on writing (characters, plot, writer's block, etc.) but she   also talks about tangential topics also important to the writer, like why being published isn't necessarily the greatest thing in the universe.  This book reminds me more of a very long, humorous  essay rather than an instruction manual. A nice change of pace from the usual &quot;How-to,&quot; guides.	1997-08-28

I think my favorites in the collection were &quot;The Prophet's Hair,&quot; and &quot;The Courter.&quot;  In fact, I think &quot;The Prophet's Hair,&quot; was the story which truly reminded me that Rushdie knows how to turn a phrase.  While at times there is a certain ambivalence in some stories, I think that is understandable in point of view of Rushdie's own background.  It is an attitude that comes from being a product of two cultures and wanting to have claims to both, not just one or the other, as Rushdie so elegantly proclaims at the end of &quot;The Courter.&quot	1997-07-30
