I came across this book 2 days after I had sold my house, since I had realized it really was a liability in tough times, not an asset, and read it within 2 days after that again.<br />Mr. Kiyosaki has some good, common-sense advice on how to manage your personal finances; he weighs opposing common points of view - personalized through his two dads - and talks about the consequences. Interesting reading all of it, not the least because we get his two dads as figures we can peg the viewpoints onto.<br />If I should sum up his advice, it is that financial success has nothing to do with how much money you start with; rather, it's whether you have the right mindset. When you see a dollar, what do you see in your mind's eye? <br />His suggested mindset for success is that of an investor, not stopping at &quot;I can't&quot; but rather asking &quot;How can I?&quot;, looking at all money matters through the eyes of an investor. It makes sense: If you start a company, would that company buy a car and a fur coat first, or would it reinvest in itself until a very affordable piece of its cash flow sufficed for the car and the coat?<br />He also has some very interesting viewpoints on learning which I agree with. The current school system was designed in Germany by Bismarck and his bureaucrats to make good ants - workers and soldiers - rather than being fit for people who want to make a living in our reasonably free society. It's no coincidence that the percentage of entrepreneurs actually go down with years of education rather than up. I say this with defiance, though, as I am a PhD who intend to go against the stream.<br />On the downside, I think the book is poorly structured. As he himself says, he is a best-selling writer and not a best-writing one. There are repetitions, fragmentation, and I as a reader did not get a good feel of sectioning of knowledge. From someone appreciating intelligence and learning the way Kiyosaki does, I would have expected a better structured presentation.	2002-10-25

Finding rhymes by phonetics is something you will appreciate in time, and it really isn't all that hard, even for foreigners like myself. The book is large, well-structured, and has a lot of what we are all looking for: Rhymes. Unfortunately, the rhymes are US English rhymes, which for the UK English speaker (and some Canadians) means:<br />1. Wrong phonetics for some words. Try as you might with your British ear, &quot;fire&quot; is not where it's supposed to be.<BR>2. Some words are listed as rhymes that simply don't rhyme in UK English.<BR>3. Some UK English rhymes are listed as non-rhymes, like &quot;forge&quot; and &quot;gorge&quot;.<br />But this is of course a problem with all US made rhyming dictionaries. If you are a US buyer, there is no reason for you not to buy the book.	2002-05-03

I will never write a play, and have no ambition in that direction. But I wanted to understand what makes a good play good and a bad play bad - and to be able to put it to words. Mr Egri has certainly enabled me to do that.<br />Egri uses the modern philosophies of dialectics as his starting point. His main thesis is that a play is a dialectical development: It has a premise to prove, and the steps taken must not be forced - must not come from outside the premises inherent in the play, in the characters and the situation set up by the playwright. It is a beautiful application of philosophical theory to practical life, and - I believe - the best currently on the market.<br />Because of this, the structure he reveals as the basis of good playwriting is also applicable to other fields like storytelling and poetry. Even to life itself, and not only in the fabrication of lies to your boss about where you were on your sick day (when you really went to a lake with your laptop to write a play).	2002-04-18

Would the same readers fault the mathematician Kurt G&ouml;del if they found his works hard to read? This book is very well written in the same sense that an advanced mathematics text may be well written. Kant displays a very clear head dealing with difficult subject matters, and makes a systematic study out of it.<br />One may agree or one may disagree with Kant. One may find holes in his arguments or one may not. But regardless of this, a reader who takes the time required for the study of this book will find that Kant's arguments are very clear. I disagree with Kant on many points - as you would expect of a man who claims Max Stirner as his closest philosophical kin - but I would never find that disagreement a reason to disparage Kant's intelligence or his ability to write. Kant's book is nothing less than a monumental achievement philosophically, and in the time after him we can not philosophize without relating to his brilliant insights.<br />The core of Kant's insight is - in my eyes - that though all our knowledge arises WITH experience, it does not thereby follow that it all arises FROM experience. Read him, and you will get a Copernican shift of perspective which may lead you to some new thoughts - and though those new thoughts may arise as you read Kant, I can in no way guarantee that they will be implied by what you have read.	2002-03-08

In Perec's &quot;Life, A User's Manual&quot; the main dimensions of movement are space, and not the least - detail. Any movement back or forth in time is merely derived from this primary movement.<br />This peculiar mode of movement gives rise to a peculiar writing style where the writer can not mention an object without at the same time mentioning its details. It is a very contagious writing style, and so while reading this book, something I mainly did on the train to and from work - usually between 7AM and 9AM in the morning and between 4PM and 7PM in the evening on weekdays, except for tuesdays when I would either leave early or arrive late due to work-outs - I found myself digressing in details (moving in the dimension of detail) as I wrote email to friends or participated in other exchanges. It might remind you of Arabian Nights, except that it is the objects and not the people who tell the stories within the stories.<br />A warning for you who wish to read this book: Just as with &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, you will find yourself wondering through the first 100 pages or so if this book is ever going to go anywhere. As opposed to the case of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, you will find it doesn't. But by that time, you won't care that it doesn't. It is a wonderfully self-contained universe that starts and ends with nothing.	2002-01-19

This, together with an affinity in the choice of themes, reminds me of Jorge L. Borges. In particular, it reminds me of those aspects of Borges that fascinates and captivates me.<br />Like Borges, Egan has a tidy mind and a tidy writing style. Not too many characters, and no strays to &quot;spice up&quot; the story. Rather, he invents quirks to the main storyline itself. My favourite in this book is &quot;Learning to be me&quot;; though the theme is familiar, the twist isn't.	2001-04-03

A conflict between two societies - the Outside, which is our society, and the Hive, a human termite hill of gigantic proportions. Herbert lets you see the inside view from both sides in this fundamental battle over human nature, and he presents it so without prejudice that you can truly wonder which society Frank Herbert himself would have preferred.<br />The human characterizations are wonderful: Herbert lets his characters live through all 5 senses in such a way that you will feel immersed in the universe of this book. You will smell fear, sexual excitement and hopeful wafts of fresh air. He also hits it right with his characters observational abilities in this book, and makes the reader wish to keep his own observations equally keen.<br />The plot is rich, and the tension escalates all the way through the book. Who will survive? Who will escape? Who will be caught out? A surprise ending has you feel the book end with a spasm of tension rather than the release you would have expected.	2001-04-01

In this book, however, he takes it a bit far in the sense that he lets the characters read from each others' body language and behaviour things that simply cannot be deduced from those contexts in such a way. A bit too far towards mind-reading, in my opinion; it continually broke off my identification with the characters and thus made the book appear very fragmented.<br />Frank Herbert is none the less intriguing to read, so while this book would deserve a mere 1 on a Herbert 1-5 scale, it gets a 2 on a more general scale. <br />If I was to finish this off as the review I would have liked to read before reading the book, I would say: &quot;Drop reading this book, and go right on to The Jesus Incident. The Jesus Incident is fully independent of Destination Void.&quot;	2001-04-01

So we expect a writing style similar to Heinlein's - the younger Heinlein at that. But Hendrix has a style different from Heinlein's - not the same tendency of going straight for the main point and the action, for one. So obviously those who seek for more Heinlein will be disappointed. As we can see from the reviews below.<br />But Hendrix premises are intriguing; present him on his own premises, and evaluate him from that.<br />(I had to get this review off my chest even though I am still at the beginning of the book. My rating is therefore still in neutral - 3 - until I've read the book to the end.)	2001-03-15

You will get to read in-depth descriptions of different grip strength types, and about possible and about improbable grip feats. Many urban legends die here.<br />Brookfield gives good advice on how to combine the exercises for the different grip types, and also shares his experience on what grip exercises that are best avoided if you want to keep gripping.<br />He also shares his best grip implements constructions, so that you will be able to walk out of your toolshed with the focused looks of an aspiring gripmaster in your eyes.<br />If you want to do one thing for your grip, buy that book!	2000-10-28

Though I've been an ab exercise addict for  years, I found a lot of new knowledge in this book, and not the least a  host of exercises that can give me the stimulation crunches can't.<br />On the  downside, he does have too many illustrations - and yet too few! The full  contact twist, for instance, would have benefited from a series of small  pictures showing the stages of the movement. But the pictures were too many  in the sense that they crowded out the text. The Janda sit-up, for  instance, deserved more of an explanation and technique description than  Pavel gave it. It is a very difficult exercise to get right on your own, so  a little list of 'signs that you do it wrong' and a how-to of correct  technique would have been very welcome.<br />All in all, I recommend the book,  despite a somewhat steep price. But I still wish for more.	2000-08-18

If you are of the kind that will buy only one book on training, make this book it.<br />The two things I miss are technique descriptions and an Index. Since I  return to Bass' books again and again, an index is the one thing I'd really  like to see added. As for technique, get Stuart McRoberts &quot;Insider's  Tell-All Handbook on Weight-Training Technique&quot;; it's the perfect  companion to &quot;Challenge Yourself&quot;.	2000-05-18

Max Stirner is a forgotten great thinker who seems to be experiencing a renaissance - particularly as a precursor to Nietzsche, Rand and anarchism.<br />The author of a single book, he stands as the most solid individualist thinker and moral critic I have ever come across. Hegelian scholar Lawrence Stepelevich of Villanova University characterizes Stirner as both the ultimate Hegelian and as the anti-Hegel; the end of the Hegelian chain. Given Hegelianism's pretenses to being a conclusive philosophy, it might be tempting to say Stirner is thereby the end of philosophy. That, however, would be wrong. <br />But to say that Stirner is the end of *moral* philosophy would be to the point; the Stirnerian critique of morality has a strength that I have yet to see a moral philosophy withstand. His is not a freshman-nihilistic \\"Can you prove morality?\\" type of critique, but rather a critique of the necessary inherent assumptions of any moral philosophy. These are strong words to say about any book. In Stirner's case, they are deserved. Have an enjoyable reading!	2000-05-18
US	50959369	R1JXY7BRHOV9L	0312870531	43847489	The Stone Canal	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Read his books in sequence	This is a recommendation for all of the author's books. He has a very different twist to Sci-Fi than most other authors I've read. Much more personal, and grounded in a contemporary Scottish reality that makes his  books seem a believable extension of our own times. All the while having  elements like Artificial Intelligence, very exotic politics,  nano-technology and competing providers (sellers) of nuclear deterrence to  the micro-nations that make up the future Earth.<br />I would, however,  strongly recommend reading his books in sequence. While The Stone Canal is  less dependent on The Star Fraction than the later books are dependent on  these two, so that it can be read independently, I would still recommend  reading the Star Fraction first.	2000-02-29
