US	50660770	RW8QDVLSPS8PB	0671023373	104801902	Man's Search For Meaning	Books	3	212	266	N	N	The good, the bad and the ugly...	Overview <br /> <br />This book is divided into two sections.  The first is a 100+ page autobiographical story of VF's experience in Nazi concentration camps, mixed with his observations on the nature of suffering and how a person can endure suffering if he/she can find meaning in it.  The second is a discussion of \\"logotherapy\\" - essentially VF's rebuttel to psychoanalysis.  In a nutshell he asserts that most people don't need psychoanalysis, but rather they need to understand that existential angst is \\"normal\\" and they need to find meaning in their lives and to know that their struggles have value. <br /> <br />The Good: <br /> <br />It's short and to the point and forgoes overly gruesome discussions of concentation camp horrors.  VF looks at the events objectively, for the purpose in redeeming them per se - i.e. to learn lessons rather than to cast judgement.  The message is profound and valuable: that our suffering has value and that we can bear up under our suffering if we find meaning in our lives. <br /> <br />The Bad: <br /> <br />As short as the book is I actually found it a bit boring and repetitive.  And I found his approach myopic - he just keeps restating his idea that finding meaning in suffering and in life is the answer to psychological problems. <br /> <br />The Ugly: <br /> <br />While witholding judgement of the Nazi's, VF actually seems to subtly judge those prisoners who \\"gave up\\", sort of implying that they had failed because they could not find a reason to live. <br /> <br />Overall I found it worth reading, but perhaps I found it old hat because I've read a lot previously on the subject of suffering and meaning and it didn't break any new ground for me personally.  I can see how others would find it quite eye opening and inspirational. : ) <br />	2005-09-29

Religion and zookeeping are the two themes that wind through this story of a young Indian boy who ponders religion and employs his knowledge of zookeeping to co-exist with a tiger on a lifeboat. <br /> <br />The story is engaging, there's a nice twist toward the end of the story, and at the very end the author adds something you rarely see in a novel - discussion questions!  While their mere presence was a bit odd, these questions shed valuable light on the story's message, expose the author's sly humor, and have kept me thinking on the story a week after finishing the book.  I'd actually like to re-read the story with an eye toward the issues raised by the discussion questions, especially the similarity between zookeeping and religion and our role as animals in the world religion's grand zoo! <br /> <br />Well worth reading!	2005-07-25

I read this to my girls who are 5 and 7 and they both loved it!  It's easy to follow, but has elements that really challenge kids' imaginations.  Even my five-year-old spent time contemplating the goings-on in this book inbetween chapters.    <br /> <br />In the first book, the heroine, \\"Jesse\\" must save the realm from a bad person.  But in this book and the subsequent ones, the challenges are in Jesse having to rise to a particular challenge rather than defeat a \\"bad guy\\".  In this story, it turns out, the folks in the realm are having problems because the Queen's pet Griffins are overzealous in their guard-dog responsibilities while the Queen is away travelling and Jesse must find a way to get them back on task, while simultaneously also working through one of her own problems (she can't dance, but has to do it in a school play).   <br /> <br />The book is about 10 chapters long, each one will only take 10 minutes or less to read.  It's probably written at a 3rd or 4th grade level so a young reader could read it themselves if they are up to grinding through 100 pages or so. <br /> <br />I personally don't think boys beyond 6 or 7 would be thrilled with this story, but this whole series is perfect for providing a young-girl hero/role-model for the young girl readers.  And also, these stories do a very good-job of introducing fairy-tale and mythic elements that kids are going to encounter all through their lives in books and movies. <br /> <br />Overall, a great story and well worth reading for young girls. <br />	2005-02-10

The story is simple enough for young kids to follow, with descriptive passages that are enough to create a realistic feeling to the story, but not so long to tax kids' attention spans.   <br /> <br />The imaginative fairy-tale type elements and situations of the story are perfect for firing young kids' imaginations, but the author avoids violence, and overly suspensefull/stressful situations.  It should be noted that in this first \\"Fairy Realm\\" book, unlike the others, there is actually a \\"bad guy\\" (or girl, rather).  The other books involve overcoming hardships, troubles, difficult situations rather than an opposing person. <br /> <br />Overall, a wonderful, easy-to-read story that kids from preschool age to young-elementary school age will love (proably girls more so than boys).  If I had to guess I'd say it's written at a 3rd or 4th grade reading level. <br /> <br />	2005-02-09

In his first book, \\"Putting on the Mind of Christ\\", Marion described the Christian's spiritual journey as a gradual rise in consciousness.  He shoe-horned (not in a bad way) it into a philosophical construct of Ken Wilber's that describes the various levels of consciousness that we as individuals and collectively as human civilization go through in our evolution of consciousness toward God. <br /> <br />Marion continues that line of thought in this book, but focuses on where western society, at large, is at in the process - i.e. we are moving beyond viewing God as a mythological being who resides up in the sky and is a seperate and somewhat detached observer of human development.  Marion describes the various philosophical, religious and scientific influences that are moving us in this direction and attempts to reconcile this manner of thought with existing Christian dogma. <br /> <br />Although this book was interesting, it repeated a fair amount of what was in his first book and covered much of the same ground that other writers have been focusing on lately such as the intersection between science and religion. <br /> <br />I would recommend reading his first book, first and then reading this one if you're hungry for more detail. <br /> <br />Overall, however, interesting and worthwhile.	2004-10-20
US	50660770	R39RT5MIXDPMO8	0306811596	363906660	A Delusion Of Satan: The Full Story Of The Salem Witch Trials	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Well written, well researched and quite insightful!	In this re-thinking of the Salem witch trials, Hill doesn't just report facts but rather analyzes the social, religous, economic, environmental and political forces in place at the time in order to come up with a plausible theory regarding the psychological mindset and motives of the parties involved.   <br /> <br />This approach works well, because religious fanaticism simply fails to explain how such heinous acts could have been allowed to go on for so long before a stop was put to it. Instead, FH exposes the mental illness that likely set the acusers in motion, the paranoia and religious extremism that allowed them to be taken seriously, and the political and economic opportunism that compelled those in power to attack their enemies via witchcraft allegations. <br /> <br />Someone could certainly level the charge at the author that she is taking liberties in her analysis, but in a sense that is necessary because no one can definitively look back to 1692 and say for certain what was going on in the minds of the accused, the prosecutors and the accusers.  However, LH qualifies her assertions, and they seem quite plausible given the evidence she cites. <br /> <br />One thing that may cause problems for some readers is that Hill never really seems to even consider that the events could have had a spiritual component to them.  Any yet, the historical descriptions of the \\"fits\\" thrown by the accusers, fits in which their bodies twist into painful and unnatural shapes, as well as bleeding from the mouth, etc. - would no doubt convince many still today that the girls might have been \\"possessed\\".  LH could have delved more into similar cases of hysteria in recent times to show the similarity, although many today would also argue for demon possession as a cause of many of today's psychological disorders.  In fact a middle-ground approach would probably acknowledge that the distinction between psychological disorders and spiritual affliction is perhaps just one of perception. <br /> <br />Another fascinating effect of the book is to cause the reader to draw comparisons to modern day \\"witch hunts\\" - i.e. the holocaust, McCarthyism, etc. and to consider what part they would have played if they were present in 1692 and the potential for evil in all of us.  It also makes one consider that the distinctions between guilt and innocence, victim and perpetrator are quite vague. <br /> <br />Overall a disturbing yet fascinating, well researched and well written telling and analysis of the events of 1692 in Salem.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended! <br /> <br />	2004-09-30

In short, the Bhagavad Ghita is a battlefield conversation between Arjuna, a warrier and the Lord Krishna. The scripture is an important part of Hindu religious scriptures and in it Krishna essentially lays out for Arjuna the nature of the soul and the various types of Yoga or paths to God.    The conversation originally comes about because Arjuna is extremely distressed at the prospect of having to kill his own relatives in the battle before him.  Krishna explains that souls can never die and that Arjuna must play his assigned role in the great scheme of things.  Furthermore, Krishna explains to Arjuna how to balance the spiritual journey with worldly obligations, and how the intentions with which we fulfill our worldly duties differentiate the spiritual man.    This book contains an introduction by Aldous Huxley which discusses the Bhagavad Ghita's relationship to Huxley's concept of the Perennial Philosophy (a common meaning of things that all religious ultimately depict).  Included at the end of the text are brief discussions on the \\"Cosmology of the Ghita\\" and the \\"Ghita and War\\".    If I could change anything about this translation, I would have liked to see more annotations throughout the text but that's a minor gripe becaus overall I found this quick and interesting and accessible for me as a first time reader of the Bhagavad Ghita.	2004-09-20

Although this book is only 160 pages, it is written in a somewhat clinical \\"voice\\" and at a fairly high reading level, and consequently reads a lot slower than one would think.  I found myself reading only a few pages at a time and frequently re-reading passages to understand his full meaning.  If you don't have some prior understanding of Jungian psychology I don't think you will enjoy the book or fully understand what he's saying. <br /> <br />It's also not a \\"how-to\\" book per se.  The various short chapters discuss concepts and issues related to ones journey to psychological wholeness, such as the need to recognize and work through issues and programming either inherited or projected onto us by our parents.  Broad suggestions are given for working with the issues but he doesn't attempt to hold the readers hand through the process and doesn't provide step-by-step instructions. <br /> <br />It's interesting reading, but don't expect the \\"Idiot's Guide to Individuation\\". <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-14

The title of this book then, \\"Balancing Heaven and Earth\\", chronicles his spiritual journey which was characterized by the need to balance or integrate the nearly undescribable bliss of heaven with the author's ordinary existence. <br /> <br />Looking back on his life while near the end of it Johnson examines and chronicles his life and spiritual journey for us, including his experiences growing up as a poor kid without a leg, his meeting with Carl Jung and subsequent career as a Jungian analyst, writer and speaker, and his adventures traveling around the world.  Especially interesting are his tales of India. <br /> <br />Johnson's \\"voice\\" comes across as grandfatherly and warm.  He doesn't claim to have achieved enlightenment, doesn't claim to know all of the answers, and he clearly isn't attempting to recruit followers, or build up his ego, resume or bank account.  He writes simply and elequently, and avoids the complex, philosophical jargon that render many writers (such as Ken Wilber) somewhat inaccessible to simple lunkheads like me. (Note however, that a basic understanding of Jungian psychology will add to one's understanding).  <br /> <br />Here is a sample passage that I particularly liked, which is the author's take on sainthood, coming after a small town in India had asked him to live there as their local \\"saint\\": <br /> <br />\\"I have meditated on the subject of sainthood many times since this experience, and I find a bit of wisdom in understanding that saints are people who suffer the projection of unlived holiness from a group of people and are made to serve in this strange role whether they like it or not.  It is only the other side of the coin of scapegoating, in which a group chooses an individual to carry the dark side of their own personalities, which they are unwilling to own for themselves...God help the poor person who is landed with either of the excesses that humankind finds equally difficult to bear.\\" <br /> <br />(The theme of people unwilling to \\"own\\" their own best qualities, and therefore projecting them onto a religious guru, is touched upon several times throughout the book). <br /> <br />Overall, this is a wonderful story of someone following God's leading throughout life and finally coming to a place where they are comfortable in their own skin, both physically and spiritually - having learned to lay down the ego's agenda and follow the subtle leading of the Spirit of God. <br /> <br />	2004-08-26

Skinner's daughters, Julie.  It turns out Skinner's study - where he keeled over into a coma before dying more than a decade earlier - has been ghoulishly preserved intact by his family down to the now stale piece of chocolate he was eating at the time.  When left alone briefly in this hallowed sanctuary what does Slater do? She picks up the chocolate and takes a bite!<br />This could be a metaphor for the irreverent manner in which Slater proceeds to violate the sanctity and decorum of modern psychology with her ensuing discussion of psychological experimentation in the 20th century.  Jumping through topics such as the heinous liberties taken by experimenters, repressed memories, drug addiction, and lobotomies Slater morphs fluidly between reporter, guinea pig and devils' advocate to show us that as much as we want to be able to explain our psychological processes in neat, categorical terms; right vs. wrong, black or white - the study of our gray matter is alas, just that - gray, and the field of Psychology is not as much of a &quot;science&quot; as the stuffy academics would have us believe. <br />And as if her commentary itself might not ruffle enough feathers in academia, she deep-sixes the clinical and objective writing style one might consider appropriate for such a topic, and instead brings the subject matter to life with a humorous and whimsical style - mixing factual reporting with cultural commentary and personal musings about why we humans behave the way we do.  <br />Overall, an entertaining, well-written and thought provoking look at experimental psychology in the last century.  Highly recommended!<BR><BR>	2004-06-28

Books	3	28	29	N	N	The Good, The Bad and the Ugly...	<BR>The Good:<br />The author challenges us to re-think our financial priorities and the way we define assets and liabilities - i.e. houses, cars and golf clubs are NOT assets in that they suck money out of us rather than generate a revenue stream for us. <br />In fact the whole message of the book could be summarized by saying, &quot;start early and put money aside into investments that will eventually generate enough revenue for you to retire&quot;.<br />The Bad:<br />The writing is very average, the book is quite repetitive, and the author comes across as pathologically obsessed with money and annoyingly ego-centric.  In fact, he appears to have thought about very little in his life other than golf and making money, ever since he was a kid.  And in pursuit of making money he chose (as he has a right to do) to forgo a lot of fun things along the way such as baseball as a kid (too busy working for free for &quot;Rich Dad&quot;) and having kids (I'm guessing here - but it's clear this guy would see kids as a financial liability - and you can't have that dragging you down).  <br />It's fine for him to make his own choices but he portrays working class people (which includes most of us) as pitiful, lazy, scared and generally pathetic failures who are all very unhappy.  He genuinely seems to believe that we can't possibly be enjoying life because we're not financially independent like him.  I felt sad for him.<br />The Ugly:<br />The title refers to the fact that his biological father worked at a job (professor) his whole life while a friend's Dad (the Rich Dad, here) taught him how to invest and get out of the &quot;rat race&quot;.  That's all fine, but despite the fact that his biological father seems to have been a decent Dad the author essentially disparages him and drags him through the mud throughout the book.  That's a very ingratious way to treat someone who brought you into this world and provided you with food, shelter, clothing and a decent home.  In fact, the author seems to loathe his father for no other reason than he was not rich.<br />The author's loathing also extends to humanity in general. He loathes and feels sorry for just about everyone who isn't him - including his so-called &quot;friends&quot;.  He gives several examples  that start out &quot;I have a friend who ...&quot; and invariably end with the author explaining why his friend is a short-sighted idiot with no vision who wouldn't take his advice.<br />Overall<br />He makes some good points about how we should view money and prepare for financial independence.  But he came across as so shallow, arrogant, ingratious and condescending - that he left me wondering whether obsessing over financial independence comes with a huge hidden cost that he is incapable of recognizing.<br />Note: In all fairness I must mention that there were a few paragraphs that talked about giving money to charities, but they weren't very convincing in the overall scheme of things.<BR><BR>	2004-06-11

After every 20 pages or so there is a page that has a one or two sentence blurb giving background information or commentary on each illusion.<br />My kids (ages 5 and 7) love looking through this book, and it's a great mental exercise for them, pondering how the effects are achieved and discovering what exactly the illusion is that's presented on each page. Note however, that some of the illusions are too cerebral for kids this age, or require too much patience to see.<br />I would have liked the book even more if it had a section that discussed the concept of illusion and how the biology of eyesight and psychology plays it's part.<br />Overall, an excellent book!<BR>	2004-04-19

And it's hard not to agree with that up to a point because we, as physical beings, are awash in a cosmic sea of signals, and are only consciously aware of a tiny, tiny percent of all of that information that is around us.  However, Wilson, at least in this book, never seems to question the validity of the extra information that is processed when you wack your brain out on drugs and every conceivable occult activity.  Nor does he seem to question very seriously the bizarre conclusions he reaches based on this information received.  And while acknowledging Leary's ideas regarding the dose, set and setting as having a strong effect on one's experience with psychedelics Wilson didn't seem to catch on that this whole UFO-alien scheme could simply have been the result of a bunch of overworked imaginations and wacked out perceptive abilities operating in a very free-thinking, government hating, ego-centric, paranoid &quot;set and setting&quot;.  <br />This myopic approach also is evident to the reader in that Wilson seems to raise every coincidence in his life to the spiritually significant level of &quot;syncronicity&quot;.  For example, several times during the book he mentions that it is a meaningful coincidence of great import that his daughter's first menstrual cycle came on the same day that Timothy Leary was arrested in Afghanistan?!  But he never mentions WHY this coincidence is meaningful.  Similarly, he is convinced that &quot;23&quot; is an important number in his life so any day, date, book, time, place, story, picture, conversation, etc. that includes the number 23 in any way, shape or form is taken to have some special &quot;meaning&quot;.   And because 2 + 3 = 5, the number 5 is treated likewise - as are the numbers 33,333, 666 and others. A plethera of symbols are also given meaningful status (birds of prey, etc.) So it's not hard to see why Wilson can find sychronicities wherever he looks.<br />It's also interesting to note that the book is packed with wild assertions about where science would be at the turn of the century (year 2000) such as people living hundreds of years, commuicating routinely via telepathy, and regular space travel via spaceships to other planets.  These things, obviously having not occurred could be forgiven as overly optimistic imagining, but to the extent that they are all part and parcel of his alien theory they cast doubt on the validity of much of what he says.<br />Wilson struck me as an intelligent, well-read, thinker with interesting perspectives on the meaning of life.  His emotional state throughout the book seemed to oscillate between loving optimism and paranoia.  And while I found his ideas a good springboard to thought, it was hard ultimately to take his conclusiond very seriously.  And it was clear that, while writing this book, he was so wrapped up in his own conspiracy theories and wacky ideas that he couldn't properly step outside of that box in order to objectively evaluate them, which was strange given his obvious intelligence.<br />Overall it's worth reading to get a strange perspective on things and I'll probably read some related material (Timothy Leary)<BR>	2004-04-19
US	50660770	R1PIT4EEENHDM7	0310205719	36906356	The Purpose Driven Life	Books	3	50	59	N	N	The Good, The Bad and the Ugly...	<BR>Overview:<br />I read this book as part of a &quot;40 days of purpose&quot; groups.  We read one chapter per day and met once per week to watch a Rick Warren video and discuss the reading.<br />The Good:<br />From the videos it's clear that Rick Warren is a warm, friendly, self-deprecating guy whose heart is in the right place.  He's trying to help clarify for people what the Christian life should look like and despite the success of this book and program it's clear from the videos that he's not in it for the money.<br />As for the content itself, it's not bad.  Essentially, Warren extracts from the Bible 5 &quot;purposes&quot; for our lives and then supports these purposes with Bible verses, anecdotes, etc.  Warren's way of organizing the material will help some people to see their Christian life from a new perspective.<br />The Bad:<br />He strongly emphasized that our &quot;performance&quot; here on Earth is a test and how we do here will determine our lot for eternity.  Despite being a Christian I don't believe that.  I believe that our physical life here on Earth is just a tiny part of a much larger spiritual journey and that spiritual growth and advancement continues after our physical death.<br />The book seemed to suggest that we all should be doing &quot;more&quot;.  I personally believe that a lot of what God wants for us to do in life is accomplished simply in our everyday task of getting up and going to work and raising a family.  I don't believe that &quot;guilt&quot; should be the motivation behind doing more church stuff, and in fact I believe that we are all too busy as it is and that this pathological business in our society actually serves to keep us from the quiet, contemplative life that God intended.<br />The emphasis of the material is too much on how we can &quot;do&quot; more to help the church, - as if doing more things will bring about the inward transformation of the Holy Spirit.  I personally believe that this inward transformation occurs when we &quot;unbusy&quot; our lives, and that outward good works will result from that inward transformation and not vice versa.<br />The Ugly:<br />As so many others have done, Warren invokes Einstein's famous quote &quot;God does not play dice&quot; - egregiously out of context - to make a religious point.  For the record, Einstein used the word &quot;God&quot; metaphorically in that quote - he could just as easily have said &quot;the universe&quot; because he wasn't professing a belief in God he was simply critizing  quantum physics (because it asserted that there is a random element in the behavior of sub-atomic particles as opposed to classical physics which asserts that if we had perfect knowledge we could predict the behavior of sub-atomic particles)!  Arrggh! Sorry - personal pet peeve.<br />Bottom Line:<br />If you need a spiritual &quot;pick-me-up&quot; or to get a better sense of purpose in your Christian life this book might do the trick.  If you're a bit more analytical and don't like &quot;Powerpoint&quot; Christianity you probably won't like this.

US	50660770	R525VIDKYH2E3	0440351626	838354674	The Magus	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Deeply engrossing symbolic tale...	<BR>In this book a young man trying to find his way in life takes a teaching position on a Greek island and gets wrapped up in the intrigue and surrealistic mind games of a mysterious and wealthy man there. <br />Well written, creative, bizarre.  Rich in symbolism, literary reference and insight with lots of twists and turns in the plot.  It makes the reader think about personal choice, morality, complicity, forgiveness, retribution, suffering and what is \\"real\\".<br />The book is purposely riddled with lacking explanations, implausibilities and plot holes.  This bats the reader back and forth between incredulity and fascination - in effect dragging them through the same process that Nicolas is enduring.  It also forces the reader to draw their own conclusions and re-enforces the subtle message throughout that \\"answers\\" are the poor mans spirituality, but that a true rise in consciousness comes only through rigorous self-examination. In fact, the ambiguity in this book will no doubt leave many readers feeling unsettled and betrayed - which, if not Fowles' intended purpose is an appropriate effect - Fowles doing to the reader what Conchis does to Nicholas throughout the story.<br />Although each reader must take from the book their own lesson, to me it was the symbolic story of the path towards enlightenment that mystical traditions in all faiths profess.  In Jungian terms (although the author via the \\"trial\\" seems to be coming at it more from the angle of ceremonial magic), Conchis represents the SELF and Nicholas the EGO.  The SELF, unfettered by man's artificial \\"morality\\" does what it is destined to do - mercilessly and systematically breaking the EGO of it's illusions.  This process was nicely symbolized again in Conchis' tale of the Norwegian zealot, who nearly blind and seemingly insane has isolated himself on a remote spit of land where he continually waits to \\"see\\" God - i.e. the SELF desperately striving to encounter God regardless of the consequences to thespiritually \\"blind\\" EGO (our conscious personality). <br />Overall, a fascinating, multi-layered, highly-symbolic portrayal of the souls journey back to God.<BR>	2004-03-31
US	50660770	R1WMPL3UBHBFNN	0440204887	988703853	Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah	Books	4	173	224	N	N	Insightful, but a bit dated...	<BR>The Plot<br />In this story, \\"Richard\\" a biplane pilot, encounters a fellow barnstormer, \\"Donald\\", who happens to be a spiritual master and retired \\"Messiah\\".  As they strike up a friendship Donald teaches Richard the lessons a Messiah must learn.<br />The Background<br />This book came out in the 70s when the hippie generation had figured out that drugs and free love hadn't filled the spiritual void that was created when they deep-sixed their parents' religious values.  Against that backdrop, this book is sort of a first stab at creating a \\"New-Age\\" doctrine.<br />The Message<br />By mixing spiritual blurbs (\\"You seek problems because you need their gifts\\") with events in the story meant to convey a particular lesson, Bach attempts to explain our own nature and the nature of what we call \\"God\\".<br />The picture of \\"God\\" here, is essentially that which mystics of all spiritual paths (including Christian mystics) seem to arrive at, ie.an all-encompassing consciousness that is beyond description and can't be anthropomorphized in the way that we love to do. Donald refers to this God as the \\"Is\\".  This particular idea is addressed in passing several times but not harped on (what purpose is there in trying to describe something that can't be described). <br />The picture of humanity is the main focus and Donald tells us that we are all our own Messiahs, that we are all gods but have just forgotten that fact.  Thus, our spiritual challenge is to transcend the illusion of our current physical situation and reclaim our true spiritual identities.<br />Analysis<br />(Note: I'm a Christian, but believe that when you move beyond a literal interpretation of Christ's words and see the symbolic message in them, it's not too different from what's in this book. But that's a big leap for most Christians and this book will probably make their blood boil).  <br />Two points of philosophical contention for me were: <br />1) Bach suggests that we are unconnected with others and haveabsolutely zero moral obligation toward them.  More recent philosophical teachings incorporated ideas concerning the interconnectedness of all things which lends a note of compassion that this story simply doesn't have.  <br />2) In the story Donald can defy the laws of nature - i.e. walk on water, levitate, etc.  The idea here is that our physical reality is an illusion, nothing more than a lucid dream that we can manipulate to our liking if we will just wake up to the illusory nature of our situation. Unfortunately, this concept is presented in a way that unwittingly replaces the \\"guilt\\" of our parents' religion with a feeling of ineptitude. Before, I was a moral reprobate because I lusted over women, but now I'm spiritual moron because I can't levitate a wrench.  What's missing here is the fact that we're all on a spiritual journey - some farther along than others and that it's okay to be where we're at - ie. we're not idiots just because we haven't solved the puzzle yet.<br />Summary<br />Overall, the story is average and the philosophy warm and fuzzy.  More recent books convey similar concepts more completely.  Nevertheless, this book was a stepping stone in the ever-evolving American spiritual psyche, and is worth reading for that reason.<br />Recommendations<br />&quot;The Alchemist&quot; by Paulo Coelho - a simple story rich in symbolic meaning for all spiritual seekers.<br />\\"A New Kind of Christian\\" by Brian McLaren - A wonderful, open-minded view of how Christian thought is evolving - for Christians who sense that standard Christian doctrine just doesn't quite add up.<br />&quot;The Ragamuffin Gospel&quot; by Brennan Manning - A wonderful discussion of the magnatude of God's love - for Christians who have problems or addictions, or feel like spiritual failures, or have been beat up by life.<br />\\"Putting on the Mind of Christ\\" by Jim Marion - for Christians particularly impervious to heresy and willing to read a more involved, serious, and thought-provoking treatment of the symbolic, mystical message of Christ.  You won't agree with all of it but it will definitely change the way you think about your own spiritual journey.<BR>	2004-03-29

Haddon does an excellent job of getting us inside the head of Christopher, who is so emotionally detached from the world and so logical in his thinking that while deftly observing the events around him he can not understand them or draw proper conclusions.  <br />The resulting story is both sad and humorous.  Sad, because we realize that on top of just the sheer challenge of coping with life, Christopher's condition has robbed him (and his family, to some extent) of the very essence of what is rewarding in life - the ability to connect emotionally with others.  In a sense we see that his autism has stolen a significant part of his humanity from him, rendering him an island unto himself unable to truly relate to others. The nuance and subtlety of life is lost on him.  And humorous because we see how Christopher's condition allows him to be more or less oblivious to the annoyance or outrage of others attempting to deal with what they see as his weird behavior.<br />Ultimately, this story is well-worth reading simply because it expands our understanding of the human condition.  Rather than being just another book in the long line of stories that we will read, and ultimately forget - this story shows us the world from a very different perspective.  And in doing so, it causes us to evaluate our own lives and to realize just how important feelings and emotions are to our ability to derive enjoyment from others and from life.<BR>	2004-02-03

It's not a murder mystery or a thriller - so if you're expecting that you'll be disappointed.  Rather, it's a story that follows the simple struggle of a family as they cope with a tragic loss.  As \\"Susie\\" tells the story from her \\"Heaven\\", she also works through the loss of a life she will never get to live.    The story is well-written and compelling, and although there is a message of hope hidden in there somewhere, it never quite compensates for the sad nature of the story.      So if you want a somewhat typical crime drama, where the bad guy finally is gunned-down in a hail of righteous violence and all of the loose ends are tied up and no psychological scars remain - this isn't the book for you.  But if you'd like a well-written, more true to life exploration of the after effects of a terrible crime, told from an interesting perspective and with a few twists - then you'll enjoy this one.	2004-01-30

Me neither.  But if you read this book you'll find out.<br />I found the characters and their interactions interesting and enjoyed the writing style.  And not knowing much about hippies (before my time) I found the ebb and flow of communal life fascinating.  As for plot, - well there were a few loose plotlines, none of which seemed to be more important than any other.  And most of them went unresolved, possibly because the book ended in what any ordinary reader would think was the middle of the story, - almost as if the author lost interest half way through and decided to write a ten-page wrap up and move on to his next book.<br />But even though the plotlines seemed fairly inconsequential, I zipped through this story quickly and enjoyed it.<BR>.	2004-01-22

And if you haven't already done it it will prompt you to ponder the meaning of your own life from a new perspective. Unless you've avoided all introspection for your entire life, this book is not going to be life-changing - but it always helps to be reminded again to step back from the rush of our lives now and then to think about our significance in the greater scheme of things.  <br />So as long as you're not expecting too much from it, it's hard to imagine anyone not liking this book except for those people who (missing the entire point) get their knickers in a twist because this picture of heaven isn't consistent with their religious viewpoint. :) <BR>	2004-01-12

Additionally, Jung being extremely intelligent and intellectual (Robertson, I would say is very intelligent but avoids coming off as intellectual) continually interrelates his ideas to religion, literature, art, mythology, while he writes which, while interesting, makes it hard for a beginner to extract just the basic ideas.<br />I've read three of Robertson's books on Jung and he has a gift for communicating Jung's basic ideas in a simple and useful manner.  <br />If you have read a bit on Jungian psychology before, this book will re-enforce your knowledge and fill in some of the blanks, - or at the very least shed light on the subject in a different way.  If you're new to Jungian psychology this book is an excellent starting point.  Sure, - it's limited and not extremely precise - but it's a quick read and will save you a lot of head-scratching once you start reading more in depth treatments of Jung's work.<br />If you're stuffy or intellectual, this book isn't for you, but if you're looking for a down-to-earth springboard to Jung, this is it!<BR>	2003-12-30

It's presented a bit differently, but it's more or less the same information.  Essentially he advocates eating 6 small meals per day - each meal consisting of a serving of carbs and a serving of protein.  <br />The middle part of the book is a cookbook - tons of BFL-friendly recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks.<br />The last third (or so) of the book is resources and reference materials, and &quot;success stories&quot; - the testimonials with before and after pictures which (I felt) made Body-For-Life so motivating and compelling.<br />Overall I like the book, but it's a bit pricey considering that similar recipes are available for free on his web site.  Also, I was disappointed that all except about two of the success stories were repeats from either Body for Life or the Success Journal.

He carefully lays out a scientific theory - essentially that matter is a phenomina of consciousness rather than vice versa.  <br />In the process he navigates through various topics in physics, mathematics, religion, and philosophy in order to provide the necessary components for us to get a grip on his theory of &quot;monistic idealism&quot; which he proposes as an alternative to the current &quot;material realism&quot; (matter is all that is real) which pervades scientific thought today.<br />I don't want to imply that I'm stupid, but the only fault I found with the book was that much of his jargon and scientific references went right over my head - so I came away with a good understanding of his theory, but also with the impression that much of it's depth and subtlties were lost on me.<br />I'm not sure how this book was received by the author's peers (if at all) but he impressed me as a &quot;blow-the-lid-off-the-subject&quot; type of scientist who is willing to ruffle feathers and push beyond the traditional limitations of his field to integrate various disciplines in a search for a truth that doesn't just look right on paper but also jives with human experience and the soul.<br />Well worth reading.<BR>	2003-12-01

At the same time we watch as this character wrestles with lonliness and a search for meaning in his life.  Horner, although possessing a place in the world, seems a lost soul - a castaway in his own life, looking for salvation outside of himself.  His character is contrasted with Herbert White, a naive oddball who although rejected by the world finds a salvation of sorts because of the lens through which he views life.<br />The characters are well-written, and the story while somewhat bleak contains an uplifting message for those who want to find it.<BR>	2003-10-27

Jung suggests that each of us has a &quot;mask&quot; and a &quot;shadow&quot;; the mask being the conscious ego that we present to the world and the Shadow self being our unconscious, where we repress all of our secret and socially-unacceptable desires.  We identify so tightly with our ego that we don't even realize that it's not our true self, and we are are oblivious to our shadow self and the inner-conflict between the two that adversely influences our behavior and our psychological and spiritual health.  Psychological and spiritual wholeness then comes from integrating these two disparate parts of our psyches.<br />In this book, Sanford reads Jungian meaning into the Biblical message, essentially asserting that the salvation Jesus was talking about was actually the same process of reconciling the unconscious and conscious that Jung hit upon 1900 years later.<br />To support this arguement he explains how Jesus' parables and other Bible stories (Prodigal son, etc) can be seen as Jungian metaphors.  For example, the well-known story of the Prodigal son can symbolically be seen as telling us that in order to be a completed work the good son in us must acknowledge and accept back the prodigal...<br />Sanford is essentially telling us that our modern understanding of Jesus' message is mostly wrong and that the &quot;narrow&quot; path that Jesus' spoke of is actually the path of reintegrating the unconscious in order to achieve psychological wholeness.  Of course the trick with that is that, because it is our unconscious, we are naturally &quot;unconscious&quot; of it - i.e. how can we go about reintegrating the unconscious without being aware of it?!?!?!?<br />That question begs for an answer, but to my utter dismay Sanford never bothers to address that question, - which more or less rendered the whole book a tribute to his own intellect rather than something with any practical use.<br />Overall I liked his ideas, but without recommendations for how to apply this information to our own spiritual quest Sanford has essentially written only half a book (and it's the most important half that is left out).<br />Note: If you're interested in Jungian psychological wholeness as a path to spiritual enlightenment, and you're open-minded enough to accept radical rethinking of Jesus' message then I suggest &quot;Putting on the Mind of Christ&quot; by Jim Marion.is information to our own spiritual quest Sanford has essentially written only half a book (and it's the most important half that is left out).<br />Note: If you're interested in Jungian psychological wholeness as a path to spiritual enlightenment, and you're open-minded enough to accept radical rethinking of Jesus' message then I suggest &quot;Putting on the Mind of Christ&quot; by Jim Marion.<BR>	2003-10-02

Thus, his experiences here are those of a pioneer of sorts trying to figure things out more or less on his own.  Consequently, his terminology and ideas are a bit outdated.  And oddly enough, his experiences themselves seem different than those typical of todays astral projectionists(?!).<br />For someone who has read a bit on OBEs I recommend this book for its perspective and for its status as an early classic.

My main complaint about that book was it's lack of focus on the spirutal implications of Astral Projection.<br />In &quot;The Secret of the Soul&quot; Buhlman probably reiterates half of the information from the previous book (which is necessary to make the topic accessible to those who haven't read the previous book) but shifts the focus from the structure of the universe to the use of Astral Projection for spiritual development.  He also includes various accounts of Astral Projections and results from his ongoing survey into the phenomina.<br />Overall I found his ideas compelling and found the book well-worth reading.  However, considering that the book concerns itself with spiritual development I would have liked to have seen a discussion of how this type of spiritual seeking relates to prevailing worldwide religious thought: Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, etc. Most people's spirituality is practiced within one of these traditions so by advocating astral projection as a means for spiritual growth without tying it into these various traditions - the proponents of astral projection unwittingly doom astral projection to be regarded as a weird, marginal or occult activity.<br />Overall, well-worth reading.	2003-09-09

The basic implication of this is that the universe and everything in it (including us) are not seperate &quot;things&quot; but one great, big, multifaceted, interacting thing - and that our current views of nearly everything are entirely wrong because of our basic, underlying misunderstanding thinking of things as seperate entities unrelated to everything else - and our insistence on seeing things as separate things.<br />Once he establishes that, framework, which is firmly based on Bohm's non-local universe theory - then he takes a flying leap and explains how this theory could explain UFOs, ESP, ghosts, near-death experiences, astral projection, stigmata, and any other &quot;supernatural&quot; phenomina.  In that sense he pushes Bohm's theory well beyond the limits that even Bohm would feel comfortable with (if he were still alive).  <br />Nevertheless, his discussions of the various supernatural phenomina and interesting and reasonably well-presented, although you get the impression that &quot;he never met a phenomina he didn't like&quot; - i.e. he's clearly biased and this book isn't going to convert very many skeptics but will provide an interesting scientific tie-in for those who already are sold on the reality of these phenomina.  Plus he makes some good points about the arrogance of some in the sciences who (just as he does) begin with a firm belief in something and then won't consider evidence that goes against those firmly held stances.<br />Good book for those who are open-minded and like pondering the nature of this thing we call reality, for lack of a better word.<BR>	2003-07-29

The writing is funny/cynical but there is almost no sustained plot.  A covert baseball game between the secret service and CIA ends in a thud.  The luncheon meat scandal just kind of hangs around, before whimpering out without much of a climax.  The love story is left hanging as are several other minor plotlines. Also, a large part of the book is comprised of the main character, Doyle, pining over the woman he loves.  That part of the book is like reading 50-pages of whining, love-sick, dreck.<br />The bottom-line is that Welter has a funny writing style, but there wasn't much of a plot, the plotlines that were there generally went unresolved, and Doyle's obsession with Natelle got old really fast.

And that accepting this basic truth is the beginning of the journey.  &quot;Discipline&quot; as he defines it (delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing) is our toolkit for facing and resolving life's problems and growing (psychologically and spiritually) in the process.  He incorporates into this process definitions of spirituality and Love, and goes on to lay out a theory of God, Grace, evolution, consciousness, etc.  He even deigns to explain sin and the ever-debated &quot;problem of evil&quot;.<br />Ultimately I found his ideas excellent food for thought, and the self-help portion of his message a worthy framework for making changes in one's approach to life.  But, having read widely on the subject of religion, spirituality and consciousness I found his foray into these areas quite simplistic and myopic (written from an entrenched position as a psychoanalyst who ironically, despite his exhortations for us to see things from another angle, couldn't seem to see things though any other lens than a therapist's - explaining almost every spiritual and psychological problem as laziness on the part of the patient).<br />Overall this book is well worth reading and great food for thought.  I'll probably go on to read his later books to see how his thoughts evolved over his career.<BR>	2003-07-14

This is what so frustrated Jesus - trying to explain the nature of something unexplainable to people, who by their nature, cling desperately to legalism because true spiritual freedom is too scary.<br />Foster outlines a variety of practices (meditation, prayer, fasting, study, simplicity, solitude, submission, service, confession, worship, guidance, and celebration) which will serve as valuable tools to bring us closer to God if we invoke them faithfully and with the leading of the Holy Spirit.<br />He has done a wonderful job in presenting these disciplines, and yet I was left with the distinct impression that, as with any exhortation to spiritual growth, it is too easy to read them, nod our heads and to walk away and not put the advice into action.  Or worse yet, to subjugate our newfound techniques to our already misguided understanding of God or to a pastor, church, spouse, or peer group that is geared toward making sure we do not break out of the spiritual status quo.<br />I am convinced that these disciplines will work wonders, if pursued passionately and with the leading of the Holy Spirit for the purpose of bringing about the radical internal transformation that Jesus compelled us to.  However I am equally convinced that 99 out of 100 readers of this book will benefit only marginally from what they read, and will not incorporate these practices very fully.<br />Maybe I've just read too many books telling me how to be a good Christian, but if there is one thing I've learned, and that this book (although excellent) re-confirmed for me, it's that reading and hearing are the easy parts.  Continually striving to incorporate spiritual disciplines into our lives, however, is something entirely different.  <br />So I guess what I'm trying to say is that this book, and many others, will point the way but if you're like me you've already (on some level) been pointed there before (in fact the Holy Spirit is pulling us all in that direction if we'd just relent and submit ourselves to it's guidance). : )<BR>	2003-07-14

What I found most interesting was that it is written from the perspective of a very well-educated intellectual who, while high on Mescaline, observes and waxes mystical and philosophical on art (paintings), of all things.  This was funny in an odd sort of way, reading an obviously passionate art appreciator discuss the merits of various artists and works of art while using a hallucinagenic drug, - however not understanding a lot myself about the history of painted artwork I think much of his commentary was lost on me.  In addition to criticizing art he also commented in general on the nature of the mind and the connection between the mind, hallucinagens and mystical experience, etc.<br />In \\"Heaven and Hell\\", Huxley discusses the nature and history of mystical experience, or as he tends to refer to it \\"visionary experience\\".  Again, he focuses strongly on the role of art (mostly painting) throughout history as being evocative of mystical visions and it's almost as if he is discussing the mystical implications of art throughout history as much as he is discussing the mystical experience itself.<br />While interesting, I found his approach a bit too intellectual for my tastes, and his fixation with art a bit beyond my reach considering I know little of art and had no frame of reference with which to personally evaluate his examples and comparisons (not being familiar with the specific works and artists that he was using for examples).  Also, compared to the wealth of written material and research available today on the subjects of hallucinagens, mysticism, and transpersonal psychology I felt that his material was a bit outdated. <br />Nevertheless, these books are worth reading and he makes many interesting points.<BR>	2003-05-28

The program is a &quot;12-week challenge&quot; - i.e. 84 days.<br />This journal provides all of the necessary forms in a hardback, mini-binder sort of format to plan and track your eating and exercise sessions for those 84 days.  Additionally, for each day there is a motivational type blurb and a new &quot;success story&quot;, complete with the before and after photos.<br />It's a bit pricey but it's a great tool for getting organized and tracking your progress.  It will also provide a record of your progress.<br />A couple of minor gripes: 1) Sundays are free days so he doesn't provide pages for those days.  It would be nice to have at least a couple of blank pages in there for your notes and observations for those days.  And 2) Since the program is all very regimented, so are the forms which means that if you want to deviate from the program or &quot;tweak&quot; it a bit to fit your schedule/lifestyle the journal is going to either not fit at all or be a bit out of whack.<br />Overall, it's a good tool for your first &quot;12-week challenge&quot;.

The exercise plan involves lifting weights 3x per week and doing a 20-minute aerobic workout 3x per week. In short he's laid out a simple, managable and sustainable diet and exericse plan focusing on how to get the most \\"bang for the buck\\" in a 12-week period.  <br />The Good -<br /> * Unlike other programs I've tried (Atkins, WW) this is a diet and exercise plan that I can see sticking with for the rest of my life.<br /> * By focusing the participant on a 12-week time frame, the program sets a reasonable expectation so that you don't get discouraged and quit after a few weeks.<br /> * It's aimed at, and suitable for anyone who needs to get back in shape, - from the former athlete to the novice who has never done weight training before.<br /> * The before and after photos and the \\"success stories\\" are very motivating.  It gets you to thinking - \\"hey, if they can do that then so can I!\\"<br />The Bad - <br /> * He should have included more tips to help people avoid injury.  It would be easy for those unaccustomed to weight training to overdue it (due to initial enthusiasm) and end up with a hernia or hurt back.  So if you do it, start slowly the first week, pay attention to proper technique and form, and consider getting a weight belt.<br /> * While I didn't mind him pushing his supplements (which he didn't do a lot of), I think he has a responsibility to fully inform readers as to possible side effects.  For example, Phosphagen is a creatine supplement sold by EAS (his affiliation to EAS is a bit unclear) and is touted as totally safe (everybody's doing it, even high-school atheletes) but if you do a web search on creatine + kidney stones you'll find some disturbing information.<br />The Other -<br /> * Todo the weight training exercises in here you'll either want to belong to a health club with various weight machines or else you'll want to buy a weight bench, barbell set and some dumbbells.  For the aerobic portion you can do any aerobic type machine as well as jogging, an aerobic video, jumprope etc.<br /> * Would have liked to see another supplemental chapter devoted to an overview of exercise physiology.<br /> * Those out here who have reviewed this book and dismissed it have obviously not done it.  I didn't read any negative reviews from someone who actually did the program, - only from those \\"nattering nabobs of negativity\\" coach potatos who would rather criticise and pick apart fitness programs rather than actually do them!<br /> * Keep in mind this book is not meant to be a detailed discussion of nutrition.  It describes in simple terms a healthy way of eating, but don't expect it to go into depth on nutrition.  Likewise it's not a body-building or weightlifting book.  He gives a simple, starter exercise regimen and details various exercises to do, - but that's it, don't expect a bodybuilding guide.<br />Summary - <br />This program is attainable and sustainable for just about anyone who wants to get in shape.  If you follow it, you will see good results.  But be warned that after it's over if you go back to your old way of eating you'll simply get out of shape again.  He makes it very clear that although it is portrayed as a 12-week challenge, 12 weeks is just the beginning but he is convinced (and I am too, now) that if you stick with this program for 12 weeks you won't want to go back.<br />Personal Note: I've been on the program for six weeks and have gone from 24% body fat to 14%, am close to achieving the initial goals I set (for 12 weeks) and although I plan to tweak both the diet and exercise a little after 12 weeks - I figure this program provides a diet and exercise framework that I can comfortably live by for the rest of my life.<BR>	2003-03-24

Missing from this book however is the wackiness that permiated those other stories.  Instead, the narrative in this story is edgy and a bit dark - largely due to the subject matter - two people with multiple personalities trying to come to grips with the childhood abuse that created their psychological problems. That said, the story is interesting and Ruff's portrayal of the various personalities inside each character's head is done in a very creative, fascinating - and non-confusing style.  <br />I highly recommend the book, but given the excellent way in that Ruff established seperate storylines that take place both in and outside the characters' heads I would have liked to have seen Ruff explore the more comic possibilities of the situations rather than focus on the dark backdrop of childhood abuse, which rendered the story darkly creative instead of comically creative - definitely worth reading, however!<BR>	2003-03-06

A variety of amazing examples are given to demonstrate how parasites adapt to and manipulate their hosts.<br />The book is written in fairly technical lingo when describing the biological details, - but in a way that was very accessible to me, who has no particular training in biology.<br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was Zimmer's constant anthropomorphizing of parasites' motives.  For example, when discussing a parasite he would say something like, \\"the parasite continually changes its cell membrane in order to fool the hosts immune system\\".  Well, that might be so in a technical sense, but let's face it - a single-celled organism is not capable of thought or reason.  So to explain it's functions in terms of human thought processes is to avoid altogether the major, huge, enormous question that I wanted answered, - namely:  <br />1) How does an organism that is incapable of thought adapt itself to exploit its host in such sophisticated manner?   Sure, he discussed adaptation over millions of years, but even in that discussion it didn't make clear for me how adaptation alone could allow a non-thinking entity to orchestrate the extremely complicated series of tricks that a parasite pulls off as a matter of course. (And to be fair, he does acknowledge on a couple of occasions that he is in fact attributing characterizations to these parasites that they, or course, are not capable of - but for each time he acknowledges that there are 100 other times when he anthropomorphizes them again!)  <br />and 2) Why does a parasite give a rat's patootie whether it survives or not?  Zimmer constantly explains parasites' actions as meant to ensure their survival, but never once does he address WHY a parasite is driven to survive.  Instinct and pleasure drive mammals to interact sexually and reproduce, - but cana simple parasite experience pleasure or possess instinct?  <br />Ultimately Zimmer is contending in this book that parasites, by affecting and controlling their hosts, have played a major role in determining how life on this planet evolved.   He makes a compelling argument, but ultimately it's a chicken-and-egg sort of question: Did parasites affect the development of larger species or did the development of larger species affect how parasites developed?  Ultimately it's probably a bit of both.<br />The bottom line is that this book is interesting and well worth reading.  It opened my eyes to a whole system of life that exists, largely unnoticed, in and around us.  <BR>	2003-03-03

Having read it, I must sadly report that it completely fails to live up to its name. Apparently the author's opinion of \\"What Really Matters\\" is drastically different than mine. <BR><BR>The things that really matter to me, for example, are giving and receiving love, being in right-standing with God, taking care of my family, and understanding the meaning of life and my purpose here on this planet. Schwartz completely ignores these things, and instead concerns himself with self-understanding, apparently so that he can be happier, more creative, less prone to stress and anger, and so that he can rid himself of back pain and play his best tennis. Toward this end he explores psychedelic drugs, meditation, psychoanalysis, biofeedback, \\"drawing on the right-side of the brain\\", the Enneagram, dream interpretation, etc.<BR><BR>In nearly 400 pages there is virtually zero discussion of God, love, prayer, service to others, or life after death. For a book called, \\"What Really Matters\\" I found that flat out weird until it occurred to me that there is no indication that the author even believes in a God or an afterlife. That would explain the self-absorbed (in my opinion) nature of his search, his lack of a higher purpose, and his inability to acknowledge that there is anything more important than himself out there. This shallowness is also apparent in the writing-style which practically screams, \\"I'm egocentric\\", despite the author having just spent years surrounded by \\"consciousness\\" types who all, in one way or another, advocate the banishment of the ego as a path to enlightenment.<BR><BR>Overall, the book is an interesting survey of some people and topics related to human potential and consciousness, but from a standpoint of \\"What Really Matters\\" it misses the mark.<BR>	2003-01-29

As bad as that sounds, this book also makes it clear that this couldn't happen without our participation.

If you're not already acquainted with Christian mysticism or the more esoteric interpreations of Jesus' words and life then prepare to have your brain (and spirit) stretched!<BR><BR>Marion portrays the Christian conversion process not as a discreet point in time where one accepts Christ and is then \\"saved\\", but rather as the soul's spiritual journey back to God.  He explains this by using his own life as an example and he places the whole journey into the framework of a psychological contruct of Ken Wilber's having to do with the various levels of consciousness that we humans (individually and corporately) progress through in our spiritual journey.  Marion also draws extensively on the experiences of St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila (Christian / Catholic mystics) to add historical (from a religious viewpoint) credence to what he is saying.<BR><BR>The book is fairly cerebral and is not an easy read, and is certain to ruffle feathers.  But if you stick with him and mull over the ideas in this book it will profoundly change the lens through which you view your spiritual journey.  You may not agree with everything Marion writes, but this type of \\"blow-the-lid-off\\" religious thought is desperately needed in a world where organized religion's primary effect seems to be to simply maintain the spiritual status quo.  If you've become bored with \\"church\\" and have a nagging feeling that standard Christian dogma doesn't quite add up then this book will be an excellent springboard to higher religious thought.<BR>	2003-01-16

Its pages are large, thick and colorful and the material is an interweaving of photos, diagrams and artistically presented text.  I point this out because it is such a striking contrast to most books these days, crammed with small, nondescript black and white text on cheap paper.  I actually found that I enjoyed just holding the book and flipping through it to soak in the visual aspect.<BR><BR><BR>As for the content, as a beginner I can't speak to it's accuracy but it struck me as a light, easy-to-read and apply overview for the spiritual seeker who is knew to the concept of energy centers in the body.  The author stays away from religious discussions and instead provides basic, and somewhat generic information on each of the 7 main Chakras.  For each Chakra the author provides affirmations, a meditation and a questionnaire (which sounds hokey, but which I actually found quite useful).<BR><BR><BR>My biggest gripe is that not enough instruction or suggestion was given regarding how to apply this information to my life.  Should I meditate on only one Chakra at a time?  How long should I meditate on a particular Chakra?  Am I supposed to \\"feel\\" something and if so, how long does it take?  What should I do next?<BR><BR><BR>Also, the author provided a variety of informational tidbits (neatly organized) about each Chakra such as the color, shape, crystal, musical note, astrological sign, internal organ, positive and negative archetypes, etc. associated with each Chakra, but almost no explanation as to why these particular attributes were assigned to particular Chakras.  Consequently I got the impression that some of the information was cheesy and a bit new-agey for my tastes.<BR><BR><BR>Overall, I found that for me the books main value was in setting up a mental construct that I could use to evaluate my life and spirituality rather than in providing significantly detailed information to really understand what Chakras are and how to use them.<BR><BR>	2003-01-15

Because I checked it out from the library I had to hurry through it but it would have been more enjoyable to have it laying around for 6 months and to just read one of the chapters every week or so - allowing time to think on that person's life a bit before rushing on to the next biography.

Then he uses this as a backdrop to develop a more detailed and realistic rendering of what Jesus was really like. In his approach he stressed seeing the events through the eyes of Jesus' various contemporaries, trying to imagine what to make of Jesus without the benefit of \\"knowing what happened\\".  This approach did help me to see the gospels in a new and interesting way.<br />For example, did you know that the \\"zealots\\" (as in Simon the zealot, the disciple) were essentially Jewish terrorists who advocated armed revolt against Rome and wouldn't even talk to or acknowledge non-Jews or those who \\"played ball\\" with the Romans.  Given that piece of information, it's interesting to note that Simon probably didn't just gush and smile when Jesus spoke with the Samaritan woman at the well, - he probably had to resist pulling his hair out!!!  <br />Examples like this abound throughout the book and Yancey digs deeper into peoples motivations to make sense of events that we're so used to glossing over while reading the gospels.  Why would fisherman just toss down their nets and follow someone?  Why are the pharisees mentioned so much more often than the Essenes, Zealots and Sadduccees?  <br />Essentially, Yancey paints a much more thorough, realistic, and human portrait of what Jesus was really like.  However, Yancey himself did still seem to have a few blind spots that I would have liked to see him address.  For example, why was the temptation even necessary at all?  What difference would it have made if Jesus did throw himself off the cliff at Satan's tempting (I don't see why that would be a sin for Jesus to do it)?  Why didn't Jesus write anything down?<br />Overall, the book is an engaging and refreshing look at Jesus and the culture he lived in - well worth reading!<BR>	2002-07-16

And in doing so we no longer need to &quot;act&quot; righteous, but instead can admit our faults and struggles comfortable in the knowledge that Jesus' loves ragamuffins and that the goal of Christianity isn't to put on a facade of righteousness, but to acknowledge our struggles and truly understand and appreciate exactly why Jesus died for us. (And he points out that ironically, when churchgoers hide their shortcomings they actually create an atmosphere in which those most in need of Jesus - those with big problems - feel out-of-place).<br />This book is a must for those who struggle or have always recognized (or at least suspected) that many of those spit-and-polished people at church have more problems then they let on.  And for those who are tired of kicking themselves and are ready to embrace Jesus' love and finally declare once and for all that there is no condemnation in Christ.<br />It should also be noted that Manning in no way encourages sin, but shows that accepting God's free gift without question is the first step toward living the best life that we can and facing our struggles without guilt and self-loathing.<br />And excellent book!<BR>	2002-07-09

This book will provide the story of his life: How he came upon his \\"gift\\", how he struggled with it, how he used it, and ultimately how he never quite understood it and was never able to establish anything lasting from it.<br />Not very much attention is given to the huge body of metaphysical thought that came from his readings, however there is a 15-page summary of the resulting \\"theology\\" at the end of the book that outlines the implications of it all.<br />Where the book fails is that it never really wrestles with whehter or not the resulting theology is \\"true\\".  It demonstrates how EC throughout his life questioned whether the gift might be co-opted and used for an evil purpose, but other than saying \\"people are being helped so it must be good\\" the author didn't ask the tough questions and apparently neither did the Cayce family.<br />And, although affirming Jesus Christ and Christianity there is very little effort put into reconciling the Cayce philosophy with the New TEstament.  They iron out a few wrinkles but ignore obvious objections.  The philosophy could almost boil down to \\"Hinduism is mostly right and Jesus showed us the right way to live\\".  Nevertheless, the Cayce take on Christianity avoids some of the obvious pitfalls of the fundamental Christian take on the Bible.<br />If this review sounds confusing it's because, as this book unintentionally makes clear, Edgar Cayce's life and legacy are confusing.  He had an odd gift that no one quite figured out.  It dominated his life and that of his family and since his death has been reduced to a bizarre footnote, ignored by Christians and embraced by misguided New Agers who Cayce would have had some very fundamental disagreements with.  And yet, his experience appears well documented and real enough to cause most of us to acknowledge that we are missing out on something very fundamental in our understanding, or lack thereof of what the truth and meaning are for our existence here on this tiny planet on the outskirts of an unimaginably huge universe.<BR><br />Definitely worth a read, but realize that if think about it at all you'll come away with more questions than you had originally.<BR><BR>	2002-06-24

In fact, the one point that seems clearest is that even the physicists themselves don't have it all figured out yet.<br />As for the Dancing Wu Li Masters metaphor, the periodic references to dancing seem contrived and the occasional references to eastern philosophy seem forced.  He seems to imply that perhaps Buddhists have had this all figured out for thousands of years, but what I took away from it was that there's a reason religion and science are very seperate entities and they should probably be left that way for the forseeable future.<br />So, if you're looking for a somewhat challenging introduction to quantum physics, that's light on the math then this will be worth your time.  If you're at all drawn to this book because of the tie-in with philosophy or religion you should look elsewhere.<BR><BR>	2002-06-05

Wonderful book!	<BR>In this book, McLaren describes how the World is on the verge of social, economic, and technological change heading into the 21st century and describes why the practice of Christianity will also change as a result. In spinning this story he compares our current social, political, economic and religious landscape to that at the time of the Protestant Reformation and puts forth some ideas on what the church will look like going forward and what the New Kind of Christian will be like.<br />Using a story about a pastor who is losing his faith, McLaren peels away the cultural trappings that we have attached to Jesus' words, in effect deconstructing them to their barest form. He demonstrates how the cultural trappings of the last 100 or so years are wearing out and suggests some new ones that will breathe new life into Christ's message going foward.<br />Although I've been a Christian for most of my life I've never been able to fully embrace the traditional implementation of Christianity. As I began to read this book it was if McLaren was reading my mind. He gathered up all of the concerns I've had and suggested new ways of looking at things, and provided me with a new framework that I can get behind.<br />YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK IF YOU:<br />* Have trouble taking the Bible literally<br />* Have trouble reconciling the loving God of the New Testament with the vengeful God of the Old.<br />* Have trouble reconciling the Bible with mounting scientific evidence that seems to contradict it.<br />* Are looking for a holistic Christian philosophy that rises  above the simplistic heaven v. hell, saved v. non-saved, right v. wrong construct that characterizes most implementations of the Christian message.<br />* Are embarrassed by the Christian image created by zealous and unyielding fundamentalists and tv evangelists.<br />* Are concerned that the Christian message seems to have been co-opted by those who seem rigid and judgemental rather than loving and compassionate.<br/>* Are committed to Jesus but are open to new ways of getting his message out to the world.<br />DON'T READ THIS BOOK (actually though it would do you good) IF:<br />* You're convinced you already know the truth and it's entirely black and white to you.<br />* You're satisfied with the \\"we're going to heaven, they're going to hell\\" simplicity of your current beliefs.<br />* You're convinced that if Jesus were here today he'd be a right- wing, fundamentalist with lots of Jewelry and his own tv show.<br />* You're uncomfortable with change and afraid of considering new ways of doing things.<br />Overall it's just about the best book on the subject of Christianity that I've ever read. McLaren has breathed new life into my faith and inspired me to do some rethinking of my own beliefs and the way I practice Christianity.<BR><BR>	2002-05-21

The subject of an intelligent creator is discussed in a objective and scientific manner and argues for a God, albeit an entirely different concept of God then religious folks would put forth.<br />The writing style in the first chapter or two struck me as a bit unpolished, as if he were hurrying to put the plot in motion so he could get on with the business of discussing God and evolution and such, but aside from the first few pages the writing struck me as well-researched and informed, and engaging.

Furthermore the action itself is somewhat unsettling, kind of like watching a sci-fi fantasy train-wreck spoil the heroes' vacation. Although it's a page-turner that keeps you reading I couldn't really call it enjoyable - the house, offkilter and dizzying, could in fact be a metaphor for the effect this book has on the reader.<br />I give it three stars for general quality and a fourth star just for the weird originality that is it's defining characteristic.<BR>	2002-02-08

He also states that this book is a \\"thought experiment\\" - i.e. the purpose is to get you thinking - it's not meant as a serious attempt to explain the universe and God.<br />That said, - those folks out here who have panned this book because its assertions are not scientifically sound are [people] who missed the point and need to go back and read the introduction again.  And those folks who dismissed the book out of hand as rehashed metaphysical stuff that they already know - well, they failed the thought experiment because they didn't use the book as a springboard to thought.  <br />Both of the types of people above actually prove one of the points in the book - that they are totally wrapped up in either  arrogance or delusion.  In fact, they probably didn't even realize that Adams was poking fun at them - oh, well.<br />Anyway, in this book Adams' character presents, in somewhat herky jerky fashion, an odd view of the universe.  Although the theory itself could probably be torn to shreds by an undergraduate philosphy class, the purpose is to get the reader to recognize the folly of thinking that we know the answers and to open themselves to the possibility that everything we think we know (religion and science) is a wrong, albeit useful construct - and in fact that we humans are intellectually incapable of fathoming reality.<br />If you ponder metaphysics/spirituality a lot then you might not find that this book breaks any new ground for you - given that you are already open to thinking strange thoughts.<br />If you're an unflinching religious zealot you'll find the book somewhat sacreligeous and, unwittingly proving his point, you'll either pray for him or send him an email informing him that he's going to hell.<br />If you're a sober, stuffy scientific sort you'll pick the specifics of the theory apart with righteous and snooty \\"I'm smarter than you\\" arrogance and in doing so, miss the whole point of the book.<br />But, if you enjoy mental exercises and realize that sacred cows make the best steaks, then you'll enjoy mulling over the ideas discussed in this book.<BR><br />It's short and a bit rough, but I gave it five stars simply becuase it earnestly attempts to give the reader's brain a good kick in the arse (if a brain can have an arse), and because it tries to slap some sense into prevailing scientific and religious cultures which have raised \\"believing one's own hype\\" to an artform.	2002-01-21

The parts of the book having to do with &quot;business&quot; were utterly implausible - either he didn't research business practices at all or didn't care to present even a vaguely realistic portrayal of how a bio-tech company really works.  Also, - the whole religious delusion thing didn't work at all - it added nothing to the book and didn't go anywhere, - almost as if he meant to do something with it and never got around to it.<br />The Ugly:<br />Although this book was a quick read, and was fairly engaging it reads like a draft of a novel that never underwent that last necessary revision before being published.  Glaring implausibilities share the same page with well researched medical passages.<br />Overall, it wasn't good enough that I'd recommend it to a friend, and not bad enough to put me off Bill Fitzhugh.

The politics of it were no doubt relevent to a communist exile 70 years ago, but are pretty corny to a 21st century American.  <br />So, my review is not a knock on Ayn Rand.

It combines stories of societal chaos, religious nuts, and aliens but ultimately fell flat for a variety of reasons...<br />First, at the very heart of a good story is a central conflict around which the plot revolves.  There didn't seem to be one here, or at least it wasn't very compelling to me as a reader (It would have been compelling if I'd cared about the characters, - more on that below).  <br />Second, the representation of religious mania was so exaggerated that it could only have been entertaining if portrayed humorously, which it wasn't.  The reverend was a way-over-the-top stereotype of those preachers on TV and his followers were cardboard &quot;followers&quot;.  No light was shed on the actual motivation of those in our society prone to religious delusions.  These followers more or less believed whatever they were told and did whatever their leader said.  Although it may seem that religious nuts in our society are this way, those who know much about real religious nuts can tell you that it's hard to get large numbers of them to agree on anything or follow any one particular leader.  So what made these ones so pliable and easy to manipulate?<br />Thirdly, the characters were largely unsympathetic. Except for Lucy, they all were deranged and as a reader I felt that the world would be better off without them.  And the protagonist spent the entire movie chasing aliens, yet we were only provided with the flimsiest explanation of why he was so obsessed with them or why he thought they were trying to take over the planet.<br />And lastly, the various plotlines were barely even resolved at the end of the book.  Instead of a climax, there is an anti-climax which left me feeling like I had sort-of wasted my time reading the preceding 370 pages.<br />If it's possible for a book to take itself too seriously, this one did.  If the book had beenwritten in a zany, wacky, humorous tone instead of being dark, pessimistic and edgy it would have worked better, in my humble opinion.<br />If you like dark, vague conspiracy theories and edgy, improbable sci-fi you might like this.  It's not a bad book, it just didn't work for me.<BR><BR>	2001-10-18

This is all set against rising tensions in the middle-east in a story that explores religious zealotry, and to a lesser degree, art.<br />The use of the (not really) inanimate objects as a narrative technique is creative and entertaining, and Tom Robbins' writing style, as usual, is highly creative and humorous.  However, the full-frontal attack on organized religion in general and Judeo/Christianity in particular was so obvious that the plot seemed superflous as if it were only a delivery mechanism to allow Robbins' to rant about religious nuts.<br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy reading rants about religious nuts - but although he threw in some background information about ancient religion, Robbins didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know. He portrayed religious zealotry as an outsider looking in and essentially recommended that everybody just chill out, but he never really got inside the mind of the zealot so that we could see the world through their bizarre and passionate lens and thus understand why they refuse to do so. (If this is what he was trying to do with the Reverend Buddy character then he missed the boat because true religious zealots are those willing to kill or be killed for their beliefs.  And let's face it, your average American Christian, even the right-wingers are mostly hot air, - they might kill or be killed over their right to drive an SUV, - but not over religious beliefs.)<br />Bottom Line: Entertaining and creative writing, above-average story (due to the band of inanimate/animate objects), but a bit heavy-handed on the anti-religion yammerings.<BR><BR>	2001-09-10

A plot that is too interesting, apparently, can even be construed as pandering to the reader.  The article's author must have read Infinite Jest.<br />This book, when read a paragraph at a time, establishes beyond doubt that Wallace writes well.  But the plot moves excruciatingly slow.  By page 200 I had to pump myself up to read more.  By page 300 I was not sufficiently interested in the story or characters to read any further.<br />To demonstrate to my wife the nature of Wallace's writing I randomly opened the book and read a page.  The passage, - a literary wonk's dream, described a coatrack falling and shearing the doorknob off a door.  Wallace spent half a page describing the circular motion of the doorknob as it rolled on the floor, including not one, but two mathematical diagrams.  <br />There were some funny passages, but ultimately not enough for me.  If you're not in a hurry and have a high tolerance for descriptive  meanderings you might like this book.  I, however,  humbly admit to being among the uncouth masses with only a moderate attention span and relatively unsophisticated literary tastes who just doesn't get a book like this (if there is, in fact, anything to get - because perhaps this book should be retitled, The Emporer's New Book).<BR>	2001-08-20

Neighbors band together to protect their communities while hoards of people gone wild and mad victimize anyone who can't protect themselves.  Life becomes cheap, - the older generation gradually has to acknowledge that things will never return to the way they were and the younger generation, while hearing their parents and grandparents description of things past, have to re-evaluate what they can hope for and what kind of life and world is still possible.<br />What struck me the most about this story is that it really isn't far-fetched at all.  And my only criticism is that the religious component was pretty silly and somewhat unbelievable.<br />Overall a great, quick read.  I'll definitely read another of this author's books.	2001-08-05

It was clear, based on their mindset (objectives and beliefs) and the religious setting that Ayahuasca seems to somehow create a religious construct through which a person can work through personal issues or sort through personal beliefs.  The experience seemed to have a profound affect on most of these people.<br />Overall, I got the impression that Ayahuasca was not connecting these individuals to something divine outside of themselves, but rather that it was freeing the brain up to explore the subconscious/ID in order to resolve problems or explore issues in the persons life.<br />Well worth reading if you're interested in this sort of thing.	2001-07-16

I would have liked more extensive descriptions from the volunteers themselves and what THIER interpretations were (not just his).<br />3) He related the volunteers' experiences with reports of alien abductions and briefly explored some physics theories about parallel universes.  I would have liked to see a more thorough investigation of these lines of thought.  <br />5) Given that most participants encountered non-material, intelligent life forms I would have liked to see a discussion of why they took on the forms they did (clowns/elves and  insects/aliens).  I'm assuming that even if the beings were &quot;real&quot; that these forms were just constructs (a &quot;user interface&quot; or &quot;front-end&quot;, if you will) the volunteers created while tripping so that they could interact with these beings (i.e. I don't believe there is a parallel universe where metaphysical clowns really exist) What is there in our collective consciousness that would cause so many of the volunteers to come up with these same constructs?  i.e - why clowns and insects instead of game-show hosts or cats?<br />Fascinating book for anyone interested in the science of consciousness, and the intersection between the material and the spiritual.<BR>	2001-06-01

Toward this end they journey from town to town with a horde of biker chicks, perform various meditations and pagan rituals, and generally work through their own issues.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting, but as a Christian I found the religious content disturbing.  The author seems wrapped up in an occult-like and mystical form of Christianity that ironically seems to have left Christ out of the equation.  Whereas Jesus advocated the banishment of the ego to bring our spirits into agreement with God's will, the type of Christianity we see here is all about self - pagan rituals, creating a feeling, and traveling to another continent to \\"see\\" an angel.  I'm pretty liberal in my Christian theology, but at it's core Christ's message was one of loving God and loving each other.  The Bible tells us that the signs of a Christ-based life are \\"Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control\\".  But despite the fact that these characters are supposedly highly \\"spiritual\\", their lives, at least as they appear in this story, are instead characterized by anxiety, detachment, and underlying hostility amongst themselves.<br /><br />Furthermore, the author at one point deigns to cast aspersions about the spiritual slumber that the average person is in.  I'm the first to admit that modern-day Christianity needs a good kick in the arse, - but (to use one of the lead characters, Valhalla as an example) I don't think leaving our spouses and children, becoming prostitutes, joining a biker gang, and performing odd pagan rituals is an improvement over the status quo.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the author tacks on a 2 or 3 page dissertation about Jesus and Love that seems strangely incongruent with the story that was just told.<br /><br />If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that instead of this book.  If you have already read The Alchemist read it again instead of this book.book.  If you have already read The Alchemist read it again instead of this book.<BR><BR>	2001-05-15

He learns 21 life lessons and for each one gets a gold ring.  Then he embarks on a career writing books and doing seminars to help others realize these same truths that he has.<BR><BR><br />The Good<BR><BR> The lessons in here are good ones about letting go of the things that hold us back and learning to embrace life more fully.  And the author genuinely seems to want for everyone to improve their lives by coming to understand and apply these principles.<BR><BR><br />The Bad<BR><BR> It's unclear whether the book is purported to be fiction or not.  It wouldn't matter, except that the author is asking us to believe that this information was supernaturally revealed to him and that he has a divine mandate from Michael the Archangel to enlighten the rest of us.  If those parts were just to &quot;spice up the story&quot; we need to know that.<BR><BR> The author portrays himself as a soap salesman (Amway?) turned motivational speaker who consorts with angels, spirit guides and Michael the Archangel while living in Sedona and jumping back and forth to Hawaii and Joshua Tree.  New age spirituality must be easy under those conditions, but  I'm not sure that these techniques would work as well for the single Mom in Pittsburgh who's working two jobs to keep a roof over her kids' heads.<BR><BR> The Ugly<BR><BR> I am suspicious of his motives given that, like so many others who have discovered the truth, he has chosen to make a career of charging other people money (in the form of books and seminars) in exchange for enlightenment. If you're just a motivational speaker, fine.  But if you have a quasi-religious/supernatural mandate to spread the truth, then it's a bit unseemly to charge $$ for it - especially if you're already financially independent (which he is, according to his web site).<BR>	2001-04-27

Not surprisingly, he refutes the New Age style message brought back by most NDE experiencers.<BR><BR>  However, his tone is not negative or positive, but very objective (given his stated reference point - The Bible).  At the beginning of the book he identifies two basic camps of NDE researchers, - those who think it is purely a physiological process and those who believe it is a spiritual one - and he declares his position which is in the middle.  He believes it is a physiological process that occurs when the brain is shutting down, and states that he also believes that it can be a gateway into a spiritual realm, but that he thinks the experiences gained in that realm (if any) are most likely deceptions by evil forces disguising themselves as &quot;messengers of truth&quot;.<BR><BR> In the first half of the book he provides a very balanced and non opinionated review of the various NDR researchers and opinions out there.  He reviews in detail medical, sociological, historical and psychological studies on the subject. In the latter part of the book he describes how the various &quot;truths&quot; espoused by most NDE experiencers are at odds with his interpretation of Christian doctrine.<BR><BR> Even though I don't share his fundamentalist Christian views, I admit he makes a pretty strong case for NDEs being primarily a physiological process.  And he points out several pieces of information that you won't read about in books by those authors who want you to believe in the spiritual &quot;truth&quot; of NDEs: The first is widespread reports of &quot;fear-death experiences&quot; (FDE) in which someone who perceived themselves to be in imminent thread of death, but who in fact did not suffer any physical harm, - had near-death experiences including going out-of-body, seeing a light, meeting relatives, etc.  The 2nd is that we have all heard ofNDE experiencers who claim to have been met by dead relatives, but what we don't hear is that many of them meet relatives who are still alive - and children often are met by imaginary figures such as Santa Claus or a teacher of theirs.<BR><BR> The one place where he argument is weak is that while acknowledging hundreds of doctors' testamonies about patients who were able to provide detailed recounting of things that occurred while they were &quot;dead&quot;, he could not provide adaquate explanation for how these patients came upon this knowledge.  He points out that medical findings suggest those in comas or near death might still be able to hear - but that's about all he offers, aside from the other assertion that evil forces might feed them information.<BR><BR> Despite the traditional Christian viewpoint this book is a thorough and careful overview of NDEs, - and is worth reading.<BR><BR>	2001-03-21

But it is an interesting story that moves quick and inspires us to evaluate our own goals and purpose in life, - and to commit ourselves to a more spiritual, meaningful and loving way of living our lives.<BR><BR> It's also a very thinly disguised delivery mechanism for the author's religious/spiritual/economic/political message.  And this message is an interesting (if mostly rehashed) melding of New-age stuff, Christianity, pro-environment, anti-corporate, anti-materialism beliefs.  The &quot;doctrine&quot; put forth is interesting and inspiring, but despite a half-hearted attempt to explain it there is little to suggest that it is *true*.  But of course nobody has a corner on spiritual truth, and ultimately we're all left to arrive at our own beliefs based on our own experiences - this book is a help in that regard.<BR><BR> So if you like feel-good, personal-journey type musings disguised as stories you'll enjoy this book.<BR><BR>	2001-03-20

Atwater is hanging by his/her fingernails from the last leaf at the end of the branch!! If you sent some Deadheads to a UFO convention for a week and then had them drop acid and write a book in 12 hours, - this is the book they would write!!<br /><br /> Don't get me wrong, - I enjoy reading about near-death experiences, but the flimsy &quot;theory&quot; put forth in this book is so wacky and unsupported that I found myself laughing at it.<br /><br /> Essentially, the author contends that in order to bring on the next stage in human evolution, aliens are abducting children who have had near-death experiences and altering their DNA in order to create a human super-race. The wholebook is filled with similar wacky, unsupported assertions - many lifted from others works. For example:<br /><br /> Taking an idea from another book, she asserts that globally, children born after 1982 are the most educated, smartest ever. And to support this she offers the following quote from a &quot;Mexican Pediatrician&quot;: &quot;The new crop of infants are coming in more aware...eyes focused and alert, necks strong, lying in bassinets no bigger than chickens and with a knowingness I can not describe. They are very special babies this new crop.&quot; (If an anonymous Mexican pediatrician comparing children to both crops and chickens in the same breath is your idea of &quot;proof&quot; then this book is for you)<br /><br /> Later she describes this &quot;crop&quot; of children as the &quot;Blue Race&quot;, because they represent the 5th of 7 (why did I know there were going to be 7?) stages in human evolution (Don't worry she provides a handy chart so you know what all 7 stages are, - 1.Red/Physical 2. Orange/Astral, etc.). To lend support here she quotes another author as follows: &quot;All children born after '98 shall be telepathic at birth. The physical body shall change to reflect the vibrational changes of Earth under the influence of the Blue Star...All races of people shall have a bluish tint to the skin as a result.&quot; She goes on to say these children will have mastered multiple languages by age 2 and will live 200 years. - Well, I have a beautiful child born in '99, but the Blue star must have missed us because she's almost two now and barely learning English. She doesn't seem telepathic and she doesn't have blue skin. (But don't worry, the author gives an example of a girl in India that looked sorta blue when she was born).<br /><br /> If this review seems jumbled,it must be because that's how the book is. She jumps through topics like the Hale-Bopp comet, alien-abductions and Christianity with only a cursory attempt to tie them all together into a theory. The only good thing about this book, was that the sheer absurdity of it provided a few chuckles...Ultimately this is just a terrible, terrible, jumbled discombobulated emalgamation of loony metaphysical yammerings - masquerading as research. The only thing &quot;near-death&quot; in this book is the author's reasoning ability!to the skin as a result.&quot; She goes on to say these children will have mastered multiple languages by age 2 and will live 200 years. - Well, I have a beautiful child born in '99, but the Blue star must have missed us because she's almost two now and barely learning English.

I gained an appreciation for those who fought to keep our nation together, and at the same time I was shocked and saddened to read events, which made clear that in civil war America, there was very little value put on an individual's life.  Today, soldiers will go to great lengths to not leave a comrade behind, but then thousands of wounded were simply abandoned in makeshift &quot;hospitals&quot; when it was time to retreat.  Those who could not keep up were simply left behind to die.  Today, rules govern the treatment of prisoners-of-war, but then Americans subjected their fellow Americans to conditions as bad as any that we see in the world today, - all the time mocking their suffering.  I am still coming to grips in my own mind, with how our ancestors of only 150 years ago could have both endured such hardship and also practiced such inhumanity to their fellow man.<BR><BR><br />What I didn't like about the book was the detached and emtionless manner in which Sneden wrote.  Considering the horrific and tragic events being described, I would think that Sneden would emphasize the emotional and personal nature of the tragedies unfolding daily.  After all, those soldiers dying their grisly deaths all had hopes, dreams and friendships that died with them, - and families waiting for them to come home.  But Sneden, for the most part, recounts each death in a matter-of-fact tone.  He also does not convey any particular sense of honor, pride or purpose which compelled the men to fight, in fact we're given almost no insight into their feelings as human beings.  Friendships are described only in superficial terms and despite the editors' many notes indicating that Sneden &quot;hated&quot; the rebels, I barely detected it in his words.  Considering the subject matter, this is a completely detached and emotionless Civil War account, - written as if its' author was lacking a soul.  And perhaps he was, after surviving such atrocies.<BR><BR><br />So, while I appreciated the visceral depiction of what the Civil War was like for the man on the ground, I wish that Sneden had described his feelings and emotions, and the feelings and emotions of those around him.  Without that we are left with only half of the human drama of the Civil War.<BR>	2001-02-06

The first half of this book depicts a symbolic and epic battle between Christians and the forces of evil, complete with flaming arrows, spiritual armour, etc.  A few pages of this would have been enough for me but it goes on for a hundred pages.  Also, we're never told whether the vision represents a battle that is occurring now or will occur at some point in the future.<br />The last half was more interesting.  Joyner speaks with a variety of figures in Heaven including Jesus and Paul.  A valuable message from these discussions was that we need to question our own motives and that our actions should be undertaken for the glory of Jesus and not to glorify ourselves.  Most interesting was the discussion with Paul in which he (Paul) asserts that Jesus' message and ministry has become so distorted in today's church that they (he and Jesus) can barely recognize it.  Unfortunately, Joyner doesn't elaborate so we're left to wonder what's so wrong with today's message and ministry, - and to wait for his next book (it's not in there either!).<br />While I found the 2nd half of the book inspiring, I was ultimately disappointed by this book and the sequel (The Call) for the following reasons:<br />1) Despite all of the symbolic battles and such, we're given scant instruction for how to apply this to our lives as Christians.<br />2) After telling us that Jesus' message and ministry are barely recognizable today, - we are not told in this book or the sequel what the problem is.<br />3) Love God, love your neighbors as yourself, and attempt to come to exemplify the fruits of the spirit (Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness and Self-control).<br />That sentence gives you more practical advice on Christian living than both of Joyner's books that I've read.  His books rant on about spiritual battles and such, but somehow don't capture Jesus' message of Love.<br />4) Despite the exhortations to question our own motives, I wonder how honestly Joyner questions his.  Paul didn't charge money for his writings, but I get the distinct feeling that Joyner is doing this, at least in part, for the money and to make a name for himself.  In The Call he flat out says that he is a prophet and that God is going to reveal truth through him.  The not so subtle message to us is that if we don't want to miss out on God's truths than we have to keep buying Joyner's books.<br />5) In these books, Joyner takes the emphasis away from Christian living and the simple act of connecting with God.  And instead, he distracts us from that pursuit with symbolic battles, and swords and eagles and such - largely unexplained.<br />When you look in a Christian bookstore today you will see thousands of books presuming to tell you how to be a better Christian, live a better Christian life, serve God better, be more inspired, pray more, sin less, etc.  I get the feeling Jesus didn't mean for it to be that complicated.  Jesus' message was simple: Love!	2000-12-22

Many Christian parents I know are, for obvious reasons, uncomfortable about the subject matter of this book.  However, even as a Christian parent, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't see any evil intent here.  It's just a fun book for kids to read, that will help them to see their own value and &quot;empowerment&quot; even in an adult world.<br />I especially liked that the book portrayed, in broad strokes, a wide array of stereotypical adults and kids that my child will likely run into throughout childhood.  An example of this is Professor Snape, who (spoiler alert) opposes and apparently hates Harry throughout the book, but ultimately is revealed as his protector.  What child doesn't have a particular teacher or adult in their life, who they are convinced hates them, when in fact that adult, in their own way is simply looking out for the child's best interests?<br />The story also provides subtle lessons in sticking up for yourself without sinking to the level of those tormenting you, - and also about perseverence and doing the right thing.  This is a valuable lesson for kids having to deal with bullies at school, or for the kid who is not part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.  What I liked most was that Harry Potter himself was essentially an &quot;everykid&quot;, who perseveres and overcomes, but does not compromise what he believes in to attain acceptence.<br />For those Christian parents with concerns about the supernatural trappings which provide the backdrop against which the action unfolds, - it should be noted that there is a clear distinction between those who are on the good side and those on the &quot;dark side&quot;.  So, at least symbolically, it can be argued that that Harry Potter is a crusader against evil and his magical gifts (again symbollically) can be likened to spiritual gifts that God provides us with to help us resist and fight against the evil in this world.	2000-11-28

I only kept reading to see what became of &quot;Harlot&quot;, - but Mailer saves that for later, evidently.<br />The most torturous element of the book is the collection of wholly unlikeable characters.  By the end of the book I didn't care what happened to any of them, - in fact I would have liked the book more if they had all died in a fiery car crash at the end.  Mailer tried to portray them as highly intelligent and complex individuals.  Toward this end he had the characters wax poetic on a variety of subjects from Christianity to Psychology, but their diatribes came across as overblown, pretentious yammerings which only served to point out that for all their supposed intelligence they couldn't avoid screwing up their own lives and the lives of others.  In fact they seemed entirely unaware of the hypocrisy, emptiness and idiocy they epitomized (and I don't think Mailer intended for me to regard them this way).<br />As for the CIA, while the story might be an accurate depiction, it draws a picture of a disfunctional organization that I found laughable.  Grandiose and ill-conceived operations such as their plans to assasinate Castro, ultimately fail in true Wylie Coyote-ish fashion.  And Mailer's CIA, apparently is  composed mostly of bisexuals from east coast prep schools.  None of the male characters can have a relationship with another male without the thought or act of sex coming into play.  Who knows, - maybe CIA operatives in the 60's were all bisexual, but I got the impression that it was merely a projection of Mailer's (is he gay/bisexual?) that, for me, detracted from the believability of the story.<br />This book represents 30 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Needless to say, I won't be reading the sequel if it ever comes out (Did it already come out? Is Mailer still even alive? My ambivilence shows itself). The second star is only because I'm an open-minded guy who can acknowledge that others apparently liked the book for some reason.	2000-11-15
US	50660770	R3NEQQZQ9PUQJB	0883682796	652767640	A Divine Revelation Of Hell	Books	1	19	31	N	N	Why can't I give it negative stars?	<BR> I'm not sure whether the author is delusional or what, but the book reads like a poorly-written scare tactic.  I can't help but think that if it were really divinely inspired God would have helped her to write a more readable and more believable book.  Instead we have an unbelievable account, full of absurd gunk.<br />If you are a Christian, don't waste your time with this book!  It doesn't have the ring of truth to it.  She claims that Jesus wanted her to describe Hell for us so that we would realize it is a real place and that we don't want to go there!  I find it highly suspicious that she came out with &quot;A Divine Revelation of Heaven&quot; shortly after this book.  Was Jesus equally concerned that we needed to know that Heaven is a good place?  <br />Don't waste your time and money on this book! Jesus' message is one of Love, not one of fear.  I refuse to believe that Jesus has to resort to scaring us into following him! <BR>	2000-10-31
US	50660770	R3TBOH4GAYYYKW	0804717117	615794550	The Epic of Gilgamesh	Books	4	16	18	N	N	Well presented for even the casual reader	<BR>I read this with almost no familiarization with things Mesopotamian.  The story itself is cryptic and many parts are still missing, but Kovacs organized the book so that there is a seperate chapter for each of the eleven tablets, and provides a one-page summary at the start of each chapter so that it's easy to understand the action and context unfolding.  <br />Keep in mind, however what the purpose of this book is.  It is simply an updated translation of the epic.  She doesn't provide a lot of commentary about peripherals such as how the epic fits into the broader body of ancient literature, or other historical information about Gilgamesh himself.  So, if you're interested in those things, look elsewhere.	2000-10-30

Ryan and Pitman, regale us, in narrative form with their geological exploits during the 90s which show that a localized flood of the Black Sea area around 7500 B.C is the origin of the various myth legends that appear in many ancient cultures' lore.<br />The Interesting:<br />* That they would choose &quot;Noah's Flood&quot; as a title, since they are essentially showing that the Biblical account of the flood was lifted from earlier Mesopotamian myths (Epic of Gilgamesh) - and was not in fact a global flood as described in the Bible.<br />* They provide a good glimpse of ancient civilization around the Black Sea area, and the various peoples, myths and languages that originated there.<br />* They provide an interesting theory about how the flood, by dispering these people, set in motion a chain reaction of events which changed the face of Europe and the world.<br />The Boring:<br />Although told in a narrative, it was slow moving, tedious and a bit jumbled.  Only a geologist will appreciate the detailed description they provide of how they took endless core samples of the Black Sea.  And, without an &quot;executive summary&quot; of sorts I found it hard to fully understand how all of the details purported to fit together. With their own work and others, instead of just explaining what they found, - they take the reader through the scientific process in painstaking detail.  <br />The book would have been much more readable if they had hired a professional &quot;novelist&quot; to write it, - nevertheless it was interesting and put me on to other related materials.	2000-10-23
US	50660770	R136OXD9M38HYX	0062513710	359601477	Adventures Beyond the Body: How to Experience Out-of-Body Travel	Books	4	86	99	N	N	Well rounded introduction to Astral Projection	In this book, Buhlman, describes his experiences based on years of astral projections, outlines his theory of the universe as it compares to currently held scientific beliefs, and provides instructions for how, you too can learn to leave your physical body.     The experiences he describes are fascinating and he appears to have thought through the implications of out-of-body travel much more  than most who do it, - attempting to fit it into a broader unified theory  of the universe if you will.      As for instruction, the basic steps he outlines in the book for having an out-of-body experience (or Astral Projection) are 1) getting into a light trance state, 2) getting into a vibrational state, where you feel vibrations pulsating through your body, and then 3)  seperating your astral body from your physical body. Buhlman gives a variety of techniques for accomplishing each of these steps.  Additionally, Buhlman discusses how religious and cultural beliefs, fear, etc. factor into one's ability to do this and the experience they'll have.    Employing the techniques in the book I found getting into a light trance fairly easy, and after about 2 weeks I  got to the \\"vibrational\\" state he describes, which was quite bizarre in itself.  Despite more attempts though I wasn't actually able to leave my body until I tried some other techniques that I found on the web - but I'm guessing if i just stuck to his techniques it would have worked also.    Since reading this book I've read many others on the subject, and I think this one is a great starting point - much better than the myriad of 98-page \\"How to have an OBE\\" books available, but easier to get your arms around than something as voluminous as Bruce's \\"Astral Dynamics\\".    Ultimately, an interesting and thought-provoking read.	2000-06-13
US	50660770	R2J8EM2BRXG06N	0553229702	277780747	Beyond Death's Door	Books	3	61	65	N	N	A different viewpoint on near-death experiences	<BR> A study of near-death experiences written by a (then) atheist doctor who was &quot;scared straight&quot; after recessitating a patient who claimed to have been in hell while clinically dead.<BR><BR> The Good:<BR> *  Based on first-hand experiences of a doctor who actually recessitated  patients who then recounted near-death experiences, some of them bad.<BR> *  He comes across as honest in his concern for people's souls.  He doesn't  want to &quot;convert&quot; people, but is genuinely concerned that some of  us are headed for a hell-ish destiny.  So it's not written from the same  New Age &quot;We're all going to Heaven&quot; standpoint as most of todays  NDE stuff.<BR> * Purposely avoids drawing widespread conclusions based on  incomplete information.  Many NDE books extrapolate wildly about the  after-life just because someone saw a bright light and felt loved.<BR> * He  genuinely wanted to warn people that not everyone has a good experience.   He tries to gently compel the reader to consider Christianity - and does it  in a non-judgemental, sensative way without bashing other  faiths.<BR><BR><br />The Bad:<BR> * Too short, - and half of the book is  padding (historical views of death and even instructions for how to  recessitate someone!)<BR> * I appreciated that he didn't try to stuff  answers down my throat, but the main drawback was that he didn't delve into  the questions raised by these experiences. For example, he points out that  even some who considered themselves Christians had hell-ish experiences -  but he doesn't try to explain why or what was lacking in their faith or  life.<BR>	2000-05-04
US	50660770	R10XV0XJJ3XFCJ	0425103277	392435278	Edgar Cayce's Story of Jesus	Books	3	30	56	N	N	Interesting, but not thoroughly believable	Using excerpts from Cayce's &quot;readings&quot; the author puts forth Cayce's intersting spin on Jesus and Christianity and provides a lot of detail on Jesus life that aren't found in the Bible.  Much of what is in  the &quot;readings&quot; is obtuse and unverifyable and it's all strung  together in a style that renders it disjointed.  Cayce goes into such  detail, in some cases giving detailed appearences of various characters  involved in Jesus' life that it seems legit and you want to believe him.   But ultimately, after reading this book and some other Cayce material on  the web, I came away thinking that Cayce's &quot;readings&quot; were just  some weird manifestation of an extremely detailed &quot;theory&quot; that  he had come up with on his own. For example, at one point we're told that  Michael the Archangel actually speaks through Cayce.  And yet what Michael  says is obtuse and more or less meaningless.  Why would Michael the  Archangel bother speaking through him if he didn't have something remotely  intelligible or meaningful to say?  The book exercises your imagination,  though.	2000-05-01
US	50660770	R20SHHFSSGHH6Z	0425103277	392435278	Edgar Cayce's Story of Jesus	Books	3	82	93	N	N	Interesting, but disjointed	The author presents information from the Edgar Cayce &quot;readings&quot; which have to do with Jesus and who he was.  Essentially, additional details are given about his birth, childhood, ministry, death and  resurrection.  Cayce's unique spin on the Christian message is blended in  and it's very fascinating.<br />The trouble is that the book relies too much  on the &quot;readings&quot; themselves which are somewhat obtuse, instead  of just explaining to us what was meant and in what context it applies.   The result is that the individual parts of the book don't really blend  together into a whole and a lot of questions are left  unanswered.<br />Nevertheless, it presents an interesting spin on Jesus and  made me want to read more Cayce-related information.	2000-04-28

A fascinating look into near-death experiences in children that will make you hopeful about what awaits us in the next life, and will get you thinking more about how you live in this life. As you can guess, the book raises more questions than it is able to answer.  But rather than try to  force an explanation the author accepts this and leaves room for each of us  to draw some of our own conclusions.  It's an easy, thought-provoking read  that dares to go against some of the cold, scientific cynicism so common in  our society today.	2000-03-28
