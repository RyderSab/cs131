If you are interested in Russian martial arts, please also read Vladimir Vasiliev's book, which is cheaper and more useful in my view. His Systema is simply amazingly effective and is the same thing as the ROSS system for all the main points and principles, although underlying philosophies may not be exactly similar. Check out Vasiliev's dvds when you get this book or his own. Great Stuff.	2005-08-15

Many of the stories contained in the book were told to me by my Sensei and are general knowledge among Okinawan karate-ka. For this the author deserves praise. Keeping stories alive is important. However, his distinction, and main thesis, between the newer \\"hard/linear\\" karate and the older soft/circular karate as an evolution born out of the \\"Shuri Crucible\\" is a very false dichotomy, and the whole \\"Crucible\\" thing is a stretch for me. Both Gusukuma and Chibana combined soft and hard teachniques that would appear to the uninitiated as soft Chinese techniques. Moreover, look at Motobu-ryu's late grandmaster Seikichi Uehara, or even all Okinawan dance for that matter. It would appear that Shotokan may be more of a devolution in Japan than the mark of evolution (also the general consensus on Okinawa). It has been my experience with Shoto-Kan practitioners that they are very unaware of the bunkai or oyo bunkai and are generally rigid in their kata and fighting. This is also the opinion of all of the Okinawans that I have spoken with. Throw a good Shoto-Kan figter in with a good Uechi or Shorin fighter and there is not much to say for the former. And if the Shoto-kan fighter is good, I would wager that they are not using the Shoto-kan principles as found in their (quite basic) versions of the kata and the Uechi and Shorin fighters are. Again, this has been my experience in 19 years of trianing and cross-training. I think that this book could be more honest if it had pointed out that Funakoshi was well known as an articulate spokesman of karate and not as a martial artist or fighter. Moreover, the devolution of Okinawan karate upon its founding in Japan under Funakoshi's students is the real story (although they were often better at what he was doing then himself). The kata as practiced by Shoto-kan are totally unrealted to their Okinawan legacy and much weaker for it.<br /><br />Regarding the distinctions between Naha and Shuri te, again, quite over- blown and simplistic. All of the differences as found on page 97, save one, are incorrect. It is common to know that Shuri practioners generally do not practice sanchin. However, Gusukuma did his whole life and even influenced the way Miyagi practiced regarding the position of the shoulders. The main differences have to do with breathing and muscle tension, as exemplified in sanchin, not with what the author contends at all. It is true, however, that not all of Itosu's students were taught the smae thing. Case in point: Close, in-fighting techniques were supposedly not taught to Chibana, but Gusukuma was taught them. What did Funakoshi know? Let the kata and style he founded speak for itself. Go to Okinawa or find an Okinawan teacher abroad, study and train for a long time and then decide.<br /><br />Lastly, the whole question about Itosu's photo. Recently two photos of him were found in Okinawa. I suppose at some point they'll end up on the net. Pretty neat.<br /><br />Now please understand that I write this not to bash Shoto-kan. It is, like the point of the book, only to remark upon some historical points of interst to help understand the tradition and gain insight into the kata.<br /><br />This is an excellent book overall for just coming up with such a creative thesis and is highly recommended.<br /><br />Enjoy!r at what he was doing then himself).

This is very much untrue, and when the question of hellenization does legitimately come up, it is more accurate to say that Hellenic thought was Christianized rather than the reverse.

Besides what is written in the book description, I would like to add that the author examines six main theologians of the \\"Paris School\\": Florensky, Florovsky, Fedotov, Bulgakov, Berdiaev, Zenkovsky.<br /><br />Much of Augustine's theology was born out of debate and personal experiences, not dialogue. His debates and fights with Donatism, Pelagianism and Manicheanism shaped him significantly. Moreover, his own perception of sinfulness penetrates many of his pages. Combined, these factors have led him to emphasize certain points of theology that many or most Eastern fathers find excessive or just wrong. Obviously he is still one of the Church's great fathers, but not a normative father for the East.<br /><br />This book demonstrates that the major point of departure for the Paris theologians from Augustine was over the notions of freedom and grace.  Of course, students of Church history will not find this surprising, but what is useful about this book is that it is to my mind the only systematic treatment of Augustine by Orthodox thinkers of such standing and influence. Moreover, it demolishes the argument that the Orthodox in the 20th century were unfamiliar with Augustine's works. They nearly all read and understood him in the original Latin and were conversant with the background of his writings and opponents. They are also quite sympathetic with many of his points. Moreover, it shows that Orthodoxy is not \\"a monolith\\". Bulgakov in particular had a strong grasp of Augustine's work. Unfortunately, his sophiological speculations have made his own works suspect and thus it would be too easy for many modern scholars who favor the disparagement of Augustine to pile it on and condemn Bulgakov at the same time. If you read French or Russian, you will be able to study this aspect of Bulgakov, however. Not yet in English.<br /><br />A final useful feature  of this book is its appendix of Russian Orthodox thinkers/theologians of the 19th and 20th centuries, briefly outlining their life and thought.<br /><br />This is a great book and I recommend it highly!utlining their life and thought. <br /> <br />This is a great book and I recommend it highly! <br />	2004-12-13

This is a very important point to make these days. So many philosophies, and especially a religion like Islam, limit God to transcendence. It is thus in defense of God's true nature that patristic Christianity steps up to the fore in this most current of debates.<br /><br />The author begins by demonstrating the falsehood of the common belief that the Hellenic temperament was universally opposed to divine passibilty. The dichotomy between the two schools of those in the bible is a false one, as it is in the Hellenic mind. Even so, the Church laid out a theology of God's own theodicy via the experience of the incarnate Christ, the Logos of the Father.<br /><br />Gavrilyuk then goes onto say, \\"I have argued in this book that the church's rejection of the major christological heresies followed a series of dialectical turns, all taken to safeguard an account of divine involvement worthy of God. `Dialectical' is not an empty word in this description: the mind of the church rejected, step by step, the three inadequate strategies that aimed at eliminating the tension between Christ's devine staus and human experiences of his earthly ministry, most poignantly expressed in a paradoxical statement: \\"the Impassible suffered\\".<br /><br />What were the three inadequate strategies? Docetism, Arianism and Nestorianism- the three main distortions of the Tradition that the Church refuted and in the process safeguarded the true love of God and possibility of our salvation. \\"What God did not assume is not healed.\\" Only this maximalist christology that takes seriously the incarnation is of any use to us who are in need of redemption. As has been said by many, a God who does not suffer is of no use. But it must be stressed that God is actually still impassible, contra Gavrilyuk, and that this impassibility of the patristic sort is actually a more profound union with humanity, if we can speak that way, than a God who changes.<br /><br />The two best books on this subject are \\"Does God Suffer?\\" by Weinandy and \\"Miracles\\"  by C.S. Lewis. They offer the best arguments, in my mind, regarding the true nature of this subject and, as it turns out, they are in a straight line from the patristic undersatnding.<br /><br />All of that said, this is still a great book and highly recommended.<br /><br />ENJOY!stressed that God is actually still impassible, contra Gavrilyuk, and that this impassibility of the patristic sort is actually a more profound union with humanity, if we can speak that way, than a God who changes.

There are many helpful notes, introductions, and topical studies that elucidate themes central, or at least unique, to Eastern Orthodoxy. In particular I found helpful the notes in the Epistle to the Romans. At the same time, I was very disappointed to find that in many places the notes were quite dumbed-down. To make it worse, in the section of morning and evening prayers, which, by the way, are very handy, there is no mention of Mary, the Mother of our God and Savior Jesus Christ!! This has lead me to conclude two things. Firstly, this production is intended to convince Portestants that we Orthodox do indeed love the Scriptures and it is a tool to draw them into our fold (which isn't a bad thing!). Secondly, the claim that it is THE Orthodox Study Bible leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Perhaps I'm a nit-pick, but to neglect the Mother of God in the prayers is wrong when it's touted as THE OSB. Perhaps in its second printing it could be modified to say AN OSB.<br />Although there are many differences between the Orthodox and the Catholics, which I in no way dismiss as superficial, I still find the Jerusalem Bible's notes helpful. The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, my former home, has published through Concordia Publishing a helpful study Bible which an Orthodox could read with profit, although there will be obvious differences in parts (i.e., Romans and James). I recommend these titles since they are more scholarly than the OSB in most respects. Nonetheless, everything they say cannot be endorsed as Orthodox and, depending on the subject in question, caution must me used.<br />I think it can also be said that the whole idea of the interpritation of scripture is that the Church in our liturgies and sermons tells us what the meaing is and we learn by finding the scriptures within the liturgical life of Mother CHurch, the Bride of Christ. THat is also why in a sense we have no need for an authoritative translation. Of course some are better than others (I.E. Jerusalem bible over the NIV), but it is still not enough. We must have the mind of the Fathers from Abraham on down.<br />All in all, don't forget that the concept of a study bible can lead to a &quot;me and my bible&quot; mentality even if you are reading one with notes from the holy Fathers.

I would give this book to all my friends if I weren't so poor. Maybe I'll sell my computer to do so...Really, though, McPartlan has done his homework and does a superb job in presenting the Eucharistic theology of two respected theologians, one Roman Catholic (de Lubac), the other Eastern Orthodox (Zizioulas), showing how it is the Eucharist which is celebrated in communion with a bishop which constitutes the Church.<br />The book is divided into three parts. First, de Lubac is presented, covering a wide range of topics which include the nature of personhood, the neopatristic synthesis, nature and supernatural, St.Aquinas and space and time, Mysticism and Eucharist, the Chalcedonian shift, universal concrete and corporate personality, the Eucharist makes the Church, the Church makes the Eucharist, bishop as High Priest, the universal and the particular Church, Jean Jaques von Allmen and Nicolas Afanassieff.<br />Part two concerns Zizioulas's works which cover most of the same themes found in part one, but from a slightly different angle. It also contains a helpful overview of Russian theologians such as Georges Florovsky, Vladimir Lossky, and Nicolas Afanassieff.<br />Part three puts de Lubac and Zizioulas in dialogue. Topics include Beginning and End, Christ and the Spirit, History and Eschatology, The Beating Heart of the Church, Baptism Penance and the Eucharist, Blocks and Strings and Spiders Webs, People of God and Body of Christ.<br />The conclusion covers The Church and the World. Complementary Critique, and Catholicity. For further reading there is an exhaustive bibliography for both theologians and a general one which is very, very helpful.<br />This book is so needed in this age of often-misguided ecumenism, which often neglects the meaning and role of the Eucharist as the Heart of the Church's life. Please look at Zizioulas' other books, especially &quot;Being as Communion&quot;. I have a few lists, too, which have great books on the subject of east/west relations in Christianity.

In a short book (91 pages of trialogue) Moody covers the basics in an engaging manner. Too often this issue is clouded over by easy arguments or jargon too technical for the average person. Since it is written as a discussion between three college students, it goes quickly and smoothly allowing the mind to move easily from each position. This book is thought out and is certainly recommended for people who are just getting into the subject. The main point of the book is to expose the reader to what other thinkers have thought concerning the perennial question. At the end of the book, Sophia says:<br />&quot;...No one is suggesting that you throw away the tools of critical reasoning. But we have spent some time talking about the arguments for God's existence. We haven't proved that he exists, but we have learned why the arguments are at least plausible to those who are inclined by their personal religious experience to believe in God. We also have shown that belief in God isn't bizarre or delusional. We come back to tolerance again. If God can give us the space to form a rational belief in him without compulsion, maybe we can learn to do the same toward each other.&quot;<br />Most people intuit that God exists, and many experience the \\"parallel universe\\" tangibly on a daily basis. While rational arguments are not needed for them, and may even seem silly at best, many others find the question vexing to the point of insanity. This book is short enough to be read in on e sitting, but deep enough to ponder for years. It is not meant to be the last word on the topic but it surely helps people from both sides of the fence and may even push a fence sitter over to the theistic side.<br />Read some C. S. Lewis. He had the brains and the heart of a renaissance man and his writings, all of them, echo with the call, often only a faint whisper, that God is nearer to each one of us than we may have first thought.<br />Other books of interest may include: The Brothers Karamazov by Feodor Dostoevsky, C.S.

I have waited for this series of six volumes to begin and here's number one! You will be moved both intellectually and spiritually by this work, guided by one of the leading Eastern Orthodox theologians in the English-speaking world.<br />&quot;This is a revised and expanded version of a book that has already appeared in French, Italian and Greek. It focuses on themes central to Eastern Christian worship and spiritual life and serves as an introduction to the series of six volumes of Bishop Kallistos collected works.<br />&quot;The opening chapter recounts the author's journey to Orthodoxy. The next two chapters provide profound and illuminating insights on death, bereavement and resurrection in Christ, and on repentance. Chapters four through seven invite us into the world of the desert ascetics and hesychast monks. Combining scholarly rigor with practical counsels on prayers, Bishop Kallistos makes the wealth of the Orthodox tradition accessible to today's Christians. The next three chapters concern personal vocation, martyrdom, spiritual guidance, and the strange path of the fool for Christ's sake. There follows a brief essay on time and eternity. The final chapter is a challenging discussion of Origen and Ss Gregory of Nyssa, Isaac the Syrian and Silouan the Anthonite, and in conversation with them Bishop Kallistos asks, 'Dare we hope for the salvation of all?' &quot;The Inner Kingdom is the first of a planned six-volume collection of works by Bishop Kallistos. His thought combines depth and honesty with judicious wisdom and balance, expressed in a clear and direct style. A teacher at the University of Oxford who lectures around the world, Bishop Kallistos speaks equally to laypeople and specialists, on both timeless mysteries and urgent contemporary concerns.&quot;<br />Other books of interest may include: The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church and In the Image and Likeness of God, both by Vladimir Lossky; A Different Christianity by Robin Amis; and, perhaps, Exploring the Inner Universe by Archimandrite Roman Braga.

When questioned about theological perspectives and \\"which one is better?\\", Bishop Kallistos often responds with a story about a buffet line on the Queen Elizabeth ocean liner. On the voyage, at every meal, you could eat not just french toast for breakfast, but steak or fish. And for dinner you could also enjoy your favorite breakfast meals. His point is that theologians need not limit their perspectives to only one `meal', but rather they ought to eat from the buffet that is laid before them. (I could have used my own experiences at Denny's for such a story but that isn't as neat and it is also a bit gross!)<br />Approaching the theology of salvation begs for a similar perspective. Anslemian or Thomastic perspectives have their place, but they can tend to push out the eastern and other western perspectives.<br />Bishop Kallistos Ware of Oxford presents 44 views of salvation according to the Scriptures and the Church Fathers. The format consists of short chapters that focus on specific elements of salvation. Topics include: Salvation as theosis (deification), exchange, process, synergism, the absolute necessity of grace, original sin, St. Augustine, the Fall, sacraments, salvation as personal but not individualistic, and many, many more topics. Ware's use of primary sources is helpful for those who wish to do further study.<br />If you are interested in Eastern Orthodoxy, this is a great book to begin with. If you are already familiar with the tradition, then &quot;How are we Saved?&quot; will refresh your memory and I'm sure teach you something new. Other books of interest include: &quot;The Orthodox Church&quot; and &quot;The Orthodox Way,&quot; both by Bishop Kallistos Ware. &quot;Common Ground,&quot; by Jordan Bajis, contains a detailed analysis of the Eastern approach to theology, Church, salvation, etc and is very detailed and informative. As well, all Vladimir Lossky books are insightful in this regard. Lossky is, however, difficult at times for those unfamiliar with technical terminology.

This book will help dispel the myth that the Eastern Orthodox Church needs to be dusted off for practical use in modern society. Each chapter stands on its own, although they all relate to Orthodoxy and modern society. I would argue that Ware's essay on the meaning of Lent and its relevance to our consumer society is worth the price alone. Twelve distinguished lay and ordained Orthodox writers are assembled here. Topics include: 1) The Orthodox Vision of Wholeness, by Gillian Crow. 2) Living in the Future, by Bishop Basil of Sergievo. 3) The Eschata in Our Daily Life, by Metropolitan Athanasios of Hercegovina. 4) Orthodox Tradition and Family Life, by Sister Magdalen. 5) Lent and the Consumer Society, by Bishop Kallistos (Ware) of Diokleia. 6) Death and Bereavement, by Bishop Anthony (Bloom) of Sourozh. 7) An Orthodox Approach to Bioethics, by Prof. H.

If you're looking for a dual between to great theologians, this isn't it. Both Fahey and Meyendorff are faithful to their respective traditions without slinging theological mud. To give you an idea of its contents, I'll quote Maximos Aghiorgoussis' forward: &quot;Our theme deals with ecumenical problems between East and West. Faith in the Holy Trinity is both the main mark of Christianity and the main problem in the relations between Eastern and Western Christendom. The Eastern and Western approaches to the doctrine of the Trinity go back to the patristic period. The entire patristic tradition of the East has a &quot;personalistic&quot; approach...whereas in the West St. Augustine authored the so-called &quot;psychological&quot; approach. This difference in approach is one of the main theological factors which played- and continues to play- and important role in the &quot;estrangement&quot; between Eastern and Western Christianity. [In this essay] two contemporary experts in these differing approaches examine the issue. On the Eastern side, the focus is placed upon St. Gregory Palamas. On the Western side, the focus is placed on the doctrine of St.Thomas Aquinas.&quot;<br />This is one of those gems that you are so thankful to find in the field of theological writings. It's a bit technical, but it's worth the struggle if you are just beginning and very illuminating if you're familar with the issues, since it poses the question from the point of view of St. Palamas; an often overlooked theologian from the often overlooked Eastern Church.<br />It is OOP but let me know if you are interested.

Using the canons as if they were self-interpreting is dangerous since it takes away the spirit of the rule, which is to bring us into a life-giving union with God in Christ Jesus.

One, he does not gloss over tough issues by evading difficult questions. He takes them head-on with respect and balance, drawing from a deep love of God and His Church. Secondly, he approaches many of the topics in a fresh way, using arguments that are not always found in other texts, conceeding points which others won't let go of, and all with an apparent willingness to be corrected by those more learned than he. You may not always agree with him, but you will certainly come to appreciate your own positions as well as his in a new way. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you learned how your own tradition works for the first time (even if you disagree with him) by sitting at the feet of Sherrard. The following is the jacket's review of the book. &quot;The division of Christiendom into the Greek East and the Latin West has its origins far back in history but its consequences still affect Europe, and thus Western Civilization. Phillip Sherrard's study seeks to indicate both the fundamental character and some of the consequences of this division. He points especially to the underlying metaphysical bases of Greek Christian thought, and contrasts them with those of the Latin West: he argues persuasively that the philosophical and even theological differences, remote as they might seem from practical affairs, are symptoms of a deep divergence of outlook that has profoundly affected the history of ideas and hence the whole course of European history. He exemplifies this by contrasting the relationships between the spiritual and the temporal powers during the Byzantine period with those assumed by the medieval Papacy; by an analysis of the 'Platonic reaction' of such figures as Gemistos Plethon; and by an exposition of the intellectual background of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and finally, of the modern western world. His concluding chapters discuss the impact of modern western ideas on Greek life and letters during that last few centuries. With an unusual knowledge of aspects of thought of the Greek Fathers often neglected in the West, and a deep sympathy with their outlook on these matters, Sherrard presents a point of view that may be unfamiliar, but should be of great concern, both to theologians and philosophers, and to historians and students of European civilization and ideed of world affairs in general.&quot; &quot;...an appeal whose passionate eloquence is reinforced by a most interesting account of the thought of some little-known Eastern scholars, theologians, and poets.&quot;- A.A.

Neuhaus. He is the editor of First Things and a leading apologist for the rationality of the Faith. Chapter four, by Fr. Patrick Reardon, deals beautifully with the trinitarian theology of the east, as well as a strong dose of proper apophaticism. It is one of the better essays that I have read on the subject. He is also the author of Christ In The Psalms which is a fantastic devotional companion to the prayer book of the Church.  Chapter five, by Bishop Kallistos Ware, deals further with the trinitarian nature of Christianity and is, like his other works and lectures, full of insight and faithfulness to the Orthodox tradition. Ware's Orthodox Way and Orthodox Church are standard introductions to Orthodoxy in the western world. The other essays, six in all, are well worth reading. Each essay is followed by a response which is either critical or supportive- usually both. Carl Braaten, a Lutheran scholar and editor of Pro Ecclesia, provides a summary that is quite insightful and useful. If you would like information about how to get the actual audio recordings of the conference, let me know via &quot;about me&quot; and I'll send you some numbers.<br />This is a book from which all Christians can benefit. As an Orthodox, I flatly reject the circle-the-wagons mentality of some who say that this book is anti-Orthodox. It is only a conference of thinkers and theologians and obviously not an Ecumenical council! Just dialogue. No one compromised anything. See for yourself. If you think so strongly that you have the truth, share it in a spirit of love and patience. Not everybody has to agree with you and do not forget that your need to be right all the time may have very little to do with love for the truth. Moreover, we can believe the right things for very wrong reasons. Talking to people who don't see things &quot;our way&quot; is one of the best measures of charity and a sure path to understanding.

Mother Mary Clare, who was one of the Anglican Church's leading spiritual directors, takes the major contemplative themes and brings to them her unique belnd of spiritual realism, vision and authority. Prayer begins and ends in the inescapable necessity of a relationship with God; the dimension of silence reveals that prayer is not only an action but a still contemplation; the path of spiritual progress is to discern in the union of action and contemplation a deeper listening which leads to an apostolate of prayer renewing the action of contemplation.

I just want as many people as possible to read this book.<br />I have been interested in the Christian experience and understanding of God for many years now, and this is the best book I have found concerning the differences in trinitarian theology between Eastern Orthodox and Western Christians(both Roman and Protestant). I know that my statement is flawed if it's taken to mean that books alone and not that prayer, eucharist, love, and faith, etc, are needed to encounter the Trinity, so don't take it that way. But on an intellectual level, surely this book helps in may ways. I'll quote the jacket:<br />&quot;This book examines twentieth century theological commentators (Barth, Rahner, Lossky, Florovsky) on the problem of the doctrine of the energies of God. Counter to existing trends in western theology, the author gives a positive evaluation of this doctrine and seeks common ground between the eastern idea of essence and energies and the western idea of the inner and economic Trinity. Though written from a clearly western perspective, the book argues the coherence of the eastern position, and that underlying both eastern and western positions is a common intention to say that the encounter with God is real, and that the primary ontological distinction is between God and creation.&quot;<br />This is worth the time to read over and over. Other books of interest will include reading the primary sources for Reid's critique. Brath's &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot;, Rahner's &quot;The Trinity&quot;, Lossky's &quot;Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot;, &quot;The Vision of God&quot;, &quot;In the Image and Likeness of God&quot;, and &quot;Orthodox Theology&quot;. All of Florovsky's works are foundational, but most, if not all, are out of print. The works of Saint Gregory Palamas are available in translation and commentary in many forms. I have used Meyendorff's two wroks, &quot;Saint Gregory Palamas and Orthodox Spirituality&quot; and &quot;A Study of Gregory Palamas&quot;.<br />Some other books to check out are &quot;The Mystery of the Trinity&quot; by Boris Bobrinskoy, Studer's &quot;Trinity and Incarnation&quot;, LaCugna's &quot;God For Us&quot;, O'Collins' &quot;The Tripersonal God&quot;, and Dimitru Staniloae's &quot;The Experience of God&quot;.<br />Being As Communion by Zizioulas is also one of the best books you may ever read on the subject.

What follows is taken from the jacket of the text:<br />&quot;More than fifteen years have passed since the original publication of Women and the Priesthood. This new edition presents us with essays of the authors who are no longer with us, Father Alexander Schmemann and Nicholas Afanasiev, and Prof. Georges Barrois, together with the editor's reflection at that time. The living contributors to the first edition have all written new essays. An article by Dr. Nonna Verna Harrison is also now included.<br />&quot;The authors search for explanations and reasons why the Orthodox Church has never in its history ordained women to serve as bishops and priests. All agree that the Church had women deacons, and that careful consideration must be given to this office as it existed in the past and as it may once again exist in the Orthodox Church.<br />&quot;No author in the present volume calls for the ordination of women as bishops and priests. All authors agree, however, that the greatest care must be exercised in dealing with this complicated and delicate issue. The Orthodox Church has no infallible magisterium. Church theologians and leaders may be wrong. The Holy Spirit acts within the whole body of believers bringing to remembrance what Christ teaches and guiding the faithful into all truth. If but one member of the Church is inspired to argue from the Bible and Church Tradition that certain women may be qualified to serve as bishops and priests, he or she must be heard with dignity and respect. Those who believe that only certain believing men are qualified for these ordained ministries must be heard in the same manner and spirit. Whatever one thinks of the thoughts of the contributors, this new edition of Women and the Priesthood serves as a model for the debate among Orthodox.&quot;<br />Contributors include Father Thomas Hopko and Bishop Kallistos Ware. And let me add something now before you say that just because the authors address the issue they are somehow automatically in favor of women priests. Fr. Meyendorff, an amazing scholar of the early Church, remarked that the most pressing issues are such because the society at large is looking to find answers to questions for which we do not always have clear reasons. This does NOT mean that the Church is wrong, but only that the mission of the Church is to bear witness to truth and putting our heads in the sand is not a proper response. And no, Bp Kallistos is not in favor of women's ordination, although he is trying to prompt us Orthodox to have a genuine response that doesn't just parrot the western critiques. What is wrong with that?<br />Other books of interest may include two by Manfred Hauke, &quot;God or Goddess?&quot; and &quot;Women in the Priesthood?&quot;; the latter being perhaps the most thorough treatment of the subject. &quot;Deaconesses&quot;, by Martimort is very detailed as well. &quot;Women and the Priesthood&quot; by von Hildebrand and Kreeft is short but interesting. Louis Bouyer's &quot;Women in the Church&quot; is older, but not dated. It includes the excellent essay on the subject by C.S. Lewis, which is also found in Lewis' &quot;God in the Dock&quot;. &quot;The Church and Women: A Compendium&quot; which includes von Balthasar, Ratzinger, Kasper, Hauke, Fessio, and many more. This book is great! Concerning feminism in general in relation to Christianity, &quot;Speaking the Christian God&quot;, ed. Alvin Kimel, Jr. is a great place to start and end. Hopko has an excellent article in it. Also, This Is My Name Forever, also by Kimel, is fantastic. For a critique of radical feminism in the Roman Catholic Church, Donna Steichen's &quot;Ungodly Rage&quot; is both informative and predictive of what the real agenda is behind much of &quot;Christian&quot; feminism, not to discreditgenuine feminism, which does not try to make all genders neuter.genuine feminism, which does not try to make all genders neuter.	2004-04-11

The Real Presence	All of the magnificent cathedrals of Europe were based upon one fact- that Christ God became present to humanity on the altar and was eaten by the faithful every divine liturgy. The architects and builders sought to pay homage to Christ's humility to come to them in the simple forms of bread and wine. Heaven and earth meet in this act. When you realize this basic fact, that the real presence is the heart of two thousand years of worship, then you begin to understand the perspective of Christian theology and worship. You also realize why the modern notions of worship, which are usually not more than emotionalism and bubblegum self-help, fall far short of the rich heritage of Christianity East and West.<br /><br />Shea's work is a great place to start if you're interested in the traditional, biblical view of the Eucharist and matter in general. Shea's book is another of those that Catholic and Orthodox (and maybe Lutheran) apologists will want to have to give away. It's cheap and accurate, as well as persuasive. While the Roman Catholic Church holds a rather defined view of the sacramental presence (compared to the Orthodox) it is well worth noting that the west approaches many topics with its own concepts, which is not something to be looked down upon or rejected as \\"a tradition of men\\". For a more detailed study, see \\"Eucharist\\" by Louis Bouyer. For general critiques of Protestant anti-Catholic arguments, see Shea's other book, \\"By What Authority?\\" or for an Orthodox approach to Protestantism, see Jordan Bajis' \\"Common Ground\\". \\"The Lamb's Supper\\" by Hahn was a nice introduction to liturgical and eucharistic theology.<br /><br />If you want to dig even deeper to realize what weight the Eucharist bears upon ecclesiology, McPartlan's books [[ASIN:0567292991 Sacrament of Salvation: An Introduction to Eucharistic Ecclesiology]], and [[ASIN:1892278618 The Eucharist Makes the Church]] are fundamental, as is the newly reissued [[ASIN:B00262DHUA Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the First Four Centuries]] by Werner Elert.

This is a very moving book and is relevant now more than ever since the word and concept \\"martyr\\" is being hijacked by Islamic extremists who are the very opposite of what a true martyr stands for. Most of my review is simply from the jacket but there are several books that I have noted which you will want to read if this issue holds any importance for your life.<br />&quot;This study is the culmination of two decades of research on Orthodox Christian Neomartyrs under the Ottoman Turks. Father Vaporis has compiled the life stories of almost two hundred faithful men and women who were by and large of humble station, possessing little or no formal education, yet gave their lives, or witnessed, for Christ...It also contains a number of accounts of Muslims who converted to Orthodox Christianity and suffered a martyr's death because they refused to return to Islam.<br />This, however, is not simply a collection of hagiographic stories. Here, the lives are retold in a fluid, easy-to-read manner, and set in an historical context to make them more accessible to the reader. Also of great interest are the many translations of the dialogue between the Neomartyrs and the Ottoman judges (kadi), during the three interrogations that were mandated by Islamic law. These records provide fascinating information on mutual perceptions and the clash between Orthodox and Islamic cultures, illustrating how the Ottomans became decreasingly tolerant of Orthodox Christians as their empire declined.<br />While of great historical interest, this collection of accounts of Orthodox Neomartyrs, who had to choose between conversion to Islam and painful torture and death, will no doubt inspire many readers in their own daily lives. Includes 16 full-color icon plates.<br />Rev. Dr. Nomikos Michael Vaporis was an historian of Byzantine history and Modern Greek Hellenism, as well as the former Dean of Hellenic College/Holy Cross School of Theology, and Director of Holy Cross Orthodox Press.&quot;<br />What produced these heroes of the faith? A religion that has been militant from its earliest times. Islam has not been a friend to non-Muslims in general and Christianity in particular. Several books by Bat Ye'or detail this millennia-long genocide. &quot;The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam: From Jihad to Dhimmitude: Seventh-Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;The Dhimmi: Jews &amp; Christians Under Islam&quot; as well as the collection of essays &quot;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide&quot; detail in depth the tragedy that has beset eastern Christianity as a result of the so-called prophet's religion. It produced true Christian martyrs- witnesses to the love of Christ God- not the suicide murderers of modern times. I do not believe that Islam must be violent, but its history  in this regard is shameful and disturbing.<br />Other books of interest may include: Pearl of Great Price, the Life and Martyrdom of Mother Maria Skobtsova 1891-1945 by Sergei Hackel; Exploring the Inner Universe, by Roman Braga. The Prophet and the Messiah is a useful and accurate overview of Christianity and Islam for beginners. May these times pass.What produced these heroes of the faith?

While not a theologian, nor a historian of dogma (he makes a few mistakes here), Besançon's  analysis of the norms guiding the representation of the divine within the Hellenic, Roman, Jewish, Early Christian, early and late medieval eras as well as the Renaissance and Baroque periods, and a bit of the modern era, are quite thorough. Although he paints with broad strokes, there are plenty of details to keep the expert busy.<br /><br />Besançon discusses in detail the notion from Plato that we are drawn to contemplate God in image, but yet there is no image that can depict the divine. This is the classical apophatic and cataphatic paradox within which the truth of Christianity, and many other religions, exist.<br /><br />As to the rest of his themes, I can only say that I am most familiar with the Hellenic and Eastern Christian philosophies of art, and in this the author is generally acquainted, but not so expert as I would have thought at first glance. Read Quenot's book on Eastern Christian icons or those of Vladimir Lossky for a more substantial assessment and explanation.	2004-04-03

Emphasis is placed upon their use of apophatic theology (talking of God by saying what God is not- negation).<br /><br />Really a useful book to dispel the myths that the theology of the Church, especially the Greek tradition, is, a al Harnak, a big squabble over an iota or a bunch of clap trap that disguises the gospel. Each culture appropriates the Gospel in a manner that makes it intelligible. Of course there will be some loose ends and need of trimming, but Pelikan expertly demonstrates the genius of these theologians in their synthetic abilities.<br /><br />My other reviews of theological books may be of interest to you in this regard.

This forms the basis of the author's challenge that the Papcy grew in strength between the period of the Council to the French Revolution. THis is a welcome review of the past work on the subject, since it gives the universal scope of the papacy and moves it beyond the local Italian politics.<br /><br />Wright shows how the various popes worked within the contexts of their political and ecclessiological confines (College of Cardinals), balancing the history out more than others. While not always successful, the papacy did achieve centralized power in the West. Wright also shows that the papacy received support from the laity, an often overlooked key to its power (power from the people).<br /><br />Highly detailed, maybe too much so for non-scholars, this book is the best one stop reading for an understanding of the origins of the papacy in the modern era.	2004-04-03

Alfeyev's monograph on the eleventh-century monk Symeon the New Theologian is the culmination of about 15 years of study, aiming to show that Symeon's teachings are in harmony with the Greek Fathers. His mystical approach is given the most attention.<br /><br />Some critics question the technique of the author of not defending his hypotheses, but merely accepting them as given and then going on to write about it. This is, of course, a problem if the text is being used in the scholarly sense, which it attempts to position itself as. Omissions of modern scholarship is noted by the reader, and when it is referenced, it is usually in a dismissive tone with inadequate reasoning.<br /><br />A good example of this is the passing over of any Messalianism in St Symeon, except in footnote references! Or the old standby \\"this falls beyond the scope of this study\\" is used to ignore a debatable point when it would seem that the issue is actually central to the premise of the book.<br /><br />More a work of hagiography, he ignores such statements that would seem heretical, or at least an opinion not held by the Tradition, such as Symeon's insistence that the reality of the Eucharist is dependent not upon the work of God, but the spiritual state of the communicant! I thought that was the whole point of the Eucharist- the forgiveness of sins unto union with God!<br /><br />The main point I find here is that the saints are sometimes approach as too holy to be questioned. However, the question becomes, \\"What are they canonized for?\\" This study is too caught up with a blind approach to the past to be considered representative of the Tradition.<br /><br />Stick with McGuckin's study.

Not a new theory, but a very useful retelling of it. And what is the theory? That St Francis' embracing of poverty actually hurt the involuntary poor by averting the care once given to them to the new Order, flooding the market, so to speak, with religious poor. Moreover, the monks, in an act of solidarity with the poverty of Christ, no longer took care of the community poor themselves, but rather added to the number, adding losses on both sides. To boot, the rich began giving charity to the voluntary poor who didn't need it in the first place.

This second edition of Thunberg's work, the major revisions of which appear mainly in the updated introduction, notes, and bibliography, has as its organizing principle the theological anthropology of Maximus; but this book is rich in insights into his christology, cosmology, soteriology, eschatology, asceticism, and ethics as well. In fact the only major dimension of Maximus's thought not substantially treated here is his trinitarian theology, although the book includes a brilliant short treatment of the function of apophatic theology in the Confessor's work.<br />Thunberg's basic judgments concerning the overall structure of Maximus's thought are still as valid now as when Microcosm and Mediator first appeared three decades ago. He asserts succinctly &quot;that Maximus' anthropology holds the key to his theology as a whole, and that this anthropology, in its turn, is a fruit of the Confessor's personal reflection on the Christological convictions of the Council of Chalcedon, as they were further demonstrated and explained through the Council of Constantinople in 553&quot; (19). Thunberg's achievement has been to demonstrate how the Neo-Chalcedonian perspective of a &quot;theandric&quot; communion of natures, negotiated hypostatically and perichoretically in Jesus Christ, frames Maximus's entire vision of the partnership between Creator and cosmos (on the macrocosmic level), and more specifically between God and the human microcosm. The properly polemical (viz., anti-Origenist) character of Maximus's thought--his thorough rehabilitation of cosmic unity-in-diversity; his profoundly incarnational christocentrism--is rightly highlighted. Where Thunberg's study excels, however, is in detailing how Maximus' anthropology is, in the truest sense, constructively theological anthropology and the fruit of his integrative synthesis.<br />Thunberg begins with Maximus's construal of the primary structures of human nature, that nature which is a microcosm of the purposeful unity-in-diversity in the created order. Maximus does envision a &quot;natural&quot; state of humanity, at least in terms of the antecedent principle (logos) which assures the basic integrity of human nature and volition over and beyond the disastrous consequences of the fall. But the &quot;natural state&quot; of humanity, as it were, is less a static or ideal condition than a created vocation set before collective humankind, as created in the image of God, freely and &quot;rationally&quot; to mediate for all of creation, to perform the &quot;cosmic liturgy&quot; through theandric communion with the Creator. Meanwhile, as a realist about human history and about the reality of the fall, Maximus spends little time on Adam's pristine or natural state, stipulating that he abused his freedom &quot;at the instant of his creation&quot; (Ambiguum 61), thereby implicating his human posterity and tragically frustrating the natural destiny of humankind.<br />As Thunberg reveals, human nature (ontologically) and human asceticism (existentially) together constitute the theater, or microcosm, in which the drama of redemption from the fall and, simultaneously, the vindication of humanity's cosmic vocation, leading to deification, unfolds. Within this scheme of things, the practice of virtue (including the cosmic virtue of love) in the imitation of Christ serves to reintegrate human nature and thus reestablish the microcosm. The disintegration brought about by manifold passions is reversed, such that the differentiated passible faculties (epithymia and thymia) are once more reoriented to their intended goal. Within the spiritual life properly speaking (bios praktikos and bios theôrêtikos), Maximus envisions humanity embracing and actively performing the various &quot;mediations&quot; to which it is called, and thus participating with Christ in bridging the chasm between male and female, between paradise and the inhabited world, between heaven and earth, between sensible and intelligible creation, and, finally, between God and his creation (Ambiguum 41). Human deification is, in the end, the capstone of this process--a process not of &quot;recovery&quot; but of genuine advance and renovation in the life of the creation. For Maximus, therefore, human deification and cosmic transfiguration are inseparable hopes, and are together grounded in the reality of the Incarnation.<br />Thunberg retells and interprets Maximus's version of this cosmic story with grace and elegance. An added virtue is that, along the way, his monograph provides a superb general treatment of the Confessor's critical interaction with the philosophical idioms of his time, and the best general survey of his constructive engagement with earlier patristic sources: Origen, Nemesius, the Cappadocians, Evagrius, Cyril of Alexandria, Pseudo-Dionysius, inter alios. Maximus's achievement is thus displayed in its broadest contexts, all of which are important to understanding his contribution to ecumenical theology.<br />In short, Microcosm and Mediator remains, over thirty years after its original publication, the most comprehensive and useful secondary study of Maximus the Confessor's thought.<br />Paul M.

Harrill (who is now at DePaul) not only explores the full range of primary and secondary material with care and depth but also identifies and avoids the pitfalls of moral anachronism that have beset so much investigation of his subject.<br />From a modern perspective, the manumission of slaves is a &quot;liberal&quot; value. A liberal St Paul would therefore endorse the practice, and a conservative St Paul resist it. Harrill destroys this presumption. In Roman society manumission was widely practiced and strongly supported by social conservatives, for the prospect of manumission was a leading instrument in the social control of slaves, who were thereby kept on their best behavior. Apologetic and polemical approaches have, almost without exception, missed the point.<br />Within this framework Harrill examines a perennial crux, 1 Cor 7:21b, which lacks an object, &quot;slavery&quot; or &quot;freedom&quot; being the dissimilar alternatives. To a pointed review of the vast literature he appends a philological analysis informed by the capacities of the TLG. He concludes that the best option is to understand &quot;use instead (freedom).&quot; These arguments will be difficult to refute. Given the conservative tendencies visible in the formation of the pauline corpus, it is not impossible than an editor of 1 Cor deleted this object. Harrill does not consider this hypothesis.<br />If &quot;freedom&quot; correctly fills in the blank, why does Ignatius (Polycarp. 4.3) appear to disapprove of efforts to purchase the freedom of Christian slaves? In response Harrill turns to an important facet of early Christian history, the use of community funds. (2 Thess 3:10, &quot;Anyone unwilling to work should not eat,&quot; for instance, only makes sense if it means &quot;not be supported by community funds.&quot;) Corporate associations with common funds could be construed as threats to society because they were miniature poleis, as it were, and rival sources of patronage. Such monies also generate internal conflict about the use and misuse of funds and the power they convey. Harrill argues that Ignatius's church-political goal was to have all common funds under episcopal control rather than in the hands of the heads of house-churches, who could use them to function as patrons. From the apologetic angle Ignatius did not wish the church to be seen as a subversive agent, purchasing the freedom of slaves whom masters might not otherwise manumit at that time. One scenario Harrill does not discuss is that of a master who might grudgingly permit a slave to become a Christian but withhold manumission on those grounds. Such hypothetical slaves might well turn to their religious communities.<br />Harrill rounds off his research with a study of corporate manumission by various bodies, including synagogues, followed by a review of slavery in early Christian literature. Although the author eschews anachronism, he nonetheless exposes and deprecates attempts to gloss over even the more beneficent forms of ancient slavery. This is a fine example of what a monograph should be: informed and informative, clear about its methods and scope, specific in focus but not narrow in compass. Even those who are quite knowledgeable about slavery in the ancient world will appreciate this competent study.<br />Richard I.

Short enough to read in an afternoon, but so packed full of ideas and primary source material that you will return to it repeatedly in your research.<br /><br />Chapter 1 details the \\"triumphalist\\" approach to understanding the suppossed triumph of Christianity ofver paganism, a la Eusebius, but that the defeat of Adrianople shook the beleif in an ordered and understandable \\"god on our side\\" worldview. According to Brown, Augustine had a more sober view of reality, which was pessimistic about \\"this age\\", and which eventually overtook the former idealism. Augustine laments the encroachment of pagan practices as converts streamed in, akin to Cato the Elder's lament about foreigners in Rome.<br /><br />Chapter 2 explores the intorlerance for alternate theologies and beliefs in the Theodosian Age, a truly sad chapter in Christian history (IMHO). What is refreshing to me is how Brown points out that in the midst of anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish activites there was a greater than expected (or currently understood and taught) amount of civility and respect. Remember, keeping the empire together was their main priority. So it was the upper class, moreso than the church or state, setting the tone of practice.<br /><br />Chapter 3 examines the idea of the holy, the saint. Reminescent of paganism, the holy man interceeded for all regardless of religion or creed. Such a man allowed the newly chrsitened, or reluctanly conjoled, to make a familiar trainsition into the new religion.	2004-03-26

It is indeed a stunning book; this folio size volume contains ninety-six full color plates gathered into groups and divided by country of origin. There are also 188 black and white plates interspersed throughout the text. Not a few of this plates find their first public appearance in this book. The reproduction of these plates is of top quality and the colors, particularly of the Armenian and the Ethiopic entries, are brilliant. From the point of view of art reproduction, the publishers are to be highly commended for a truly beautiful--yea, stunning--book.<br />This volume represents a companion volume to Liturgical Press's previously issued translation of Mahmoud Zibawi, The Icon: Its Meaning and History (1993), equally &quot;stunning&quot; in its artwork. One can see clearly from the mere titles of these two book that the volume under review here covers a much broader territory. In this volume, Zibawi opens with a general introduction to the characteristics and history of the Eastern Mediterranean, the region in which each of these Eastern Christian Communities is found (9-20). In a second chapter, he goes on to a brief discussion of the history of the &quot;Exchanges and Intercommunion&quot; between the Eastern Christian communities (21-30). In Chapter 3, he compares the two primary artistic methods of the Eastern Churces, &quot;Iconic and Aniconic,&quot; and the preferences, manifestations, and developments within each of these communities (31-46). In chapters 4 through 7, Zibawi covers the history and artistic achievement of four primary Eastern Christian Communities that he discusses: the Syrians (47-100), the Armenians (101-54), the Egyptians [= Copts] (155-208), and the Ethiopians (209-62). A very brief epilogue, followed by a Selected Bibliography, Glossary and Credits, then concludes the book (263-72).<br />While this volume follows its predecessor in its stellar artistic reproductions, it unfortunately also follows that volume in its lack of primary scholarship and lack of overall organization. The chapters each wander back and forth from ecclesiastical and/or political history to art history to descriptions of certain works of art back to ecclesiastical history. The artistic descriptions cover nearly every type of art and architecture found in these communities: churches, carvings, icons, frescoes, manuscript illuminations, miniatures, and some sacred vessels. However, these descriptions only rarely correspond to the plates in the volume, and in the few cases that the black and white plates are described, they are almost never referenced. The descriptions are also rather superficial, describing merely the scene depicted, only rarely venturing into an evaluation of its importance or its interpretation within the community's faith and worship. References to influences of other cultures, Christian or pagan, are also sporadic and then only rarely supported. Historical introductions, aided by the translator's penchant for keeping throughout the book the present tense of the original French instead of the more idiomatic English past tense, read like &quot;grand sweeping descriptions.&quot; But not only can one only recount so much detail of a millennium or more in the space of three or four pages, Zibawi manifests little first hand knowledge of the areas with which he is dealing. A quick glance at the bibliography at the end of each chapter reveals Zibawi's complete dependence on secondary French works. Even where he includes a quotation from a primary source it is culled from a secondary work or, less often, from a French translation of the work. While it might be defensible for an art historian to be dependent on secondary sources for the historical and political background, the sketchiness and superficiality of the artistic descriptions also leaves the reader wondering just how conversant Zibawi is with art history as well.<br />While these general comments may sound overly harsh, they are meant only to indicate that the scholar will find nothing new and little of use in this volume. The general reader, however, will find a book whose artwork is so impressive that it alone just might serve as the hook to lure her/him into the field of Eastern Christianity, if not as a scholar then as a more educated amateur. While there are certainly gaps in the bibliography, there is nonetheless enough for the interested reader to find a reasonable entry into the literature.<br />In general, the volume is well edited, though there remains a number of errors in the Selected Bibliography at the end of the volume, e.g., Pelikan, Yaroslav for Pelikan, Jaroslav; Apren, Mar for Aprem, Mar; Isaac of Antioch for Isaac of Nineveh, John of Edessa for John of Ephesus, Narsallah for Nasrallah, and Garso'ian for Garsoïan, to cite but a few. For some reason, throughout chapter 5, on the Armenians, one consistently finds the name of the great historian of Siwnik' as Stephen Oberlian instead of the correct Orbelian. In sum then, while this book will be of little or no importance to scholars, it will nonetheless serve as a mark of very great distinction on one's coffee table for the beauty of its photographic plates. It will remain the judgment of each individual reader to determine whether such a distinctive adornment is worth $100.00.<br />Edward G.

Henn suggests that the faith of the Old Testament was a communal one of monotheism and convenant, whereas the faith of the early Christians is more a polemic against gnosticism and docetism, thus necessitating a more dogmatic and theological explination.<br /><br />Henn rejects the popular idea that the orthodox faith just happened to be the one that beat all challnegers and has no more or less truth (the \\"Bauer thesis\\") and instead demonstrates that there was a unity in diversity in the early communities and that they also had some distinctions that did in fact lead to teh rejection of some teachings that were simply untrue to the historical experience of the people of God in Christ. (Yves Congar, another excellent writer and orthodox ecumenist, held a similar thesis and his books are highly recommended.)<br /><br />Henn is less detailed in his patristic analysis, but it is still useful as he covers the main Western and Eastern Fathers, demonstrating their orthodoxy and \\"unity in diversity.\\" A weakness, in my view, is that he still holds a very modern Roman Catholic view of the papacy and projects this into the fathers where it simply is not found. Of course this can be argued, but if you read him he goes too far. Silence does not mean consent, either.<br /><br />The great Orthodox theologian and patristic scholar Georges Florovsky once wrote in La Sainte Eglise Universelle that, for the Fathers, the Church is not a subject for discussion in the explicit sense. \\"One does not define what is self-evident. [The Church] was a living reality more than an object of study.\\" Henn echoes this fact, writing that the unity we seek is not to be found in imitating the past, but in finding the basis for that common faith, namely, the common faith!<br /><br />Ut Unum Sint., namely, the common faith!

The tendency in treatments focusing on Dogmengeschichte has been to regard the period as a sort of quiet backwater, highlighted occasionally by evidence of the decays and glimmerings of Augustinianism. Such a viewpoint has never been adequate, and its insufficiency has been underscored in recent decades by the renewed scholarly interest in the profound social and cultural transformations of the fifth and sixth centuries. Rebecca Weaver's monograph makes a substantial step forward by setting the &quot;Semi-Pelagian&quot; controversy in the context of some of these transformations.<br />Weaver's interests are theological, a fact which--O tempore!--sets her treatment apart from much that is currently being written about early Christianity. Her central thesis is unremarkable, namely, that the controversies over divine grace and human agency that burst forth sporadically from Augustine's last years (c. 426) to Orange were the function of deep differences of theological concern and social setting between the disputants. Such differences have been noted before. Weaver's study, however, is remarkable in its ability to mark out their contours through careful, sensitive reading of the polemical texts.<br />Weaver distills the differences between, on the one hand, Augustine and his defenders and, on the other, those who questioned his doctrine of divine grace. The former, operating within a congregational setting, sought to safeguard the sovereignty of grace, while the latter, from within a monastic milieu, aimed to preserve the connection between human actions and human destiny. While Augustine's opponents could be regarded as traditionalists, following a path tracing back through Evagrius Ponticus and Origen, Augustine's own account of divine grace was novel and &quot;almost entirely self-constructed.&quot; The &quot;Semi-Pelagian&quot; controversy, then, is essentially a clash between two different ways of conceiving the relations between God and humanity, &quot;the Augustinian and the monastic.&quot; At first blush, this distinction may seem overdone; Augustine was, after all, a cenobite of a sort and a guide to the monastic life. In truth, the distinction between the two perspectives might be expressed with greater nuance. But the reality to which it points is clear enough. As Weaver patiently demonstrates, the differences between Augustine and, for example, John Cassian, were so deep that they could not be overcome by the convergences of vocabulary that marked the century-long evolution of the controversy.<br />Beginning with Augustine's troubles with the monks of Hadrumetum, Weaver traces this evolution through a clear and informative survey of the writings of the combatants: Cassian, Prosper of Aquitaine, Vincent of L&eacute;rins, Faustus of Riez, Fulgentius of Ruspe, and Caesarius of Arles. This survey is unobtrusively informed by the most recent scholarship, and Weaver proves herself a careful reader of texts. The result is the clearest and most theologically astute account of the &quot;Semi-Pelagian&quot; controversy now available. It also suggests the need for detailed and comprehensive accounts of Gallic and North African monasticism. This book should certainly be in every theological library. It is a sure guide to an important period in the history of doctrine, for the Augustine who emerged from this period, his rough predestinarian edges worn somewhat smoother by the course of this controversy, was the doctor of grace for the Middle Ages.<br />Thomas A.

In the Introduction Jefford looks at the history of the term &quot;Apostolic Fathers,&quot; at the documents which are considered part of the collection, and at the dates of composition. Each subsequent chapter takes a so-called &quot;Apostolic Father&quot; and discusses the manuscript tradition, literary form, authorship, date, setting, purpose, primary elements, special images, and relationship to scripture. Particularly useful are the diagrams, tables and maps which help the reader place the author/document in his/its literary and historical context.<br />However, there are some problems. In the introduction to his book Jefford says that it is for students doing work at the &quot;college, seminary or graduate level,&quot; but there will be &quot;no footnotes or endnotes for the student to ignore or skip.&quot; This is particularly problematic for the serious student, for Jefford, throughout the book, speaks of &quot;many scholars&quot; or &quot;many historians&quot; supporting a certain conclusion or position. The reader has no idea who these &quot;scholars&quot; are.<br />There is also the difficulty of imprecise language which is found throughout the book. Statements are made which do not have supporting evidence. On p. 5 he states that &quot;many of the writings in the apostolic fathers were considered to have the authority of scripture.&quot; Actually, only three of the recognized nine Apostolic Fathers (I Clement, Barnabas, and the Shepherd of Hermas) were considered canonical, and these only in certain Christian communities.<br />On p. 11 in introducing the Letter of Barnabas he says that the author is non-Jewish, but this issue had not been settled among scholars. He argues that the author's use of the &quot;allegorical method&quot; of interpreting Scripture, used by gnostic Christians, is evidence of an Egyptian setting. However, while gnostics were found in Egypt, and while gnostics used the allegorical method of interpretation, gnostics were not found exclusively in Egypt, nor were they the only early Christians to use allegory to interpret Scripture.<br />Even with these minor flaws, this study represents a useful introduction to the Apostolic Fathers which can be used as a beginning for a further, deeper study of the literature of the early Church.<br />Roger S.

In that review, I commended the book for demonstrating so clearly how important patristic research is to the present ecclesiastical situation, despite its reputation as &quot;arcane.&quot; Reading Robert Wilken's Remembering the Christian Past, I was delighted to experience the same reaction again. Previously published or delivered in a variety of forums, some academic, others confessional, the eight essays contained in this volume survey a diverse range of sources from many religious milieux in the late antique and medieval period in response to current questions regarding scholarly integrity, religious pluralism, the teaching of virtue, and even the politics of the Middle East. With his masterful command of the sources and incisive style, Wilken lays to rest once and for all the claim that patristics is irrelevant to the contemporary situation in universities, churches, and society at large. <br />The first essay, &quot;Who Will Speak for the Religious Traditions?,&quot; Wilken's 1989 AAR address, is programmatic for the rest of the collection. In it, he questions the view currently held in many quarters of the academic world that personal commitment to and affiliation with a specific religious tradition are impediments to objective critical study of that tradition. Wilken argues that far from hindering such study, personal engagement with the religious tradition one studies can unleash reason's critical and imaginative powers, an effect he sees demonstrated in the lively three-way dialogue that took place between Christian, Jewish, and Muslim sages in the Middles Ages. In the next essay, &quot;Religious Pluralism and Early Christian Thought,&quot; Wilken takes on the current question of religious diversity in a multicultural society, placing it in context by examining Origen and Augustine's response to pagan arguments against Christianity's claim to be an exclusive way to salvation. Wilken argues that for both these authors, such a claim was based on events in biblical history (Christ's resurrection and the establishment and ongoing witness of the Church) that were (and, he implies, still are) open to critical scrutiny. &quot;No Other Gods,&quot; originally published in First Things, the journal of ecumenical orthodoxy, continues the examination of Origen and Augustine's critiques of philosophical theism begun in the previous essay. In it, Wilken argues that, for both theologians, the latter misses the mark because it refuses to see what God has done for humankind in Christ and to embrace the new life and worship of the one true God this event has made possible. Wilken uses this critique to make his own passionate plea for the restoration of Christian culture to Western society. <br />These spirited polemical essays are followed by two with a primarily exegetical focus. &quot;Not a Solitary God: the Triune God of the Bible&quot; is an excellent survey of the biblical evidence and patristic exegesis of it that contributed to the development of the doctrine of the Trinity. &quot;In novissimis diebus: Biblical Promises, Jewish Hopes, and Early Christian Exegesis&quot; examines patristic exegesis of Isaiah 2 for evidence of the Christian &quot;spiritualization&quot; of Old Testament promises for the restoration of Israel to the Jewish people, a practice that continues to have implications for today's Jewish-Christian dialogue. <br />&quot;The Lives of the Saints and the Pursuit of Virtue,&quot; my favorite essay in this collection, considers the rise of Christian hagiography in the fifth century, arguing against an Aristotelian background that saints' lives proved a superb way to illustrate and inspire the habitual practice of virtue over a lifetime, to introduce new role models (such as Christian holy women), and to encourage unpredictable, creative responses to moral challenges. Although the polemical application is more muted here, the relevance of such material for contemporary Christian paranesis is clear. <br />&quot;Loving God with a Holy Passion&quot; presents Maximus the Confessor's understanding of the role of the passions in the spiritual life. Wilken places Maximus within the context of foregoing debate on this topic, and outlines his ultimately positive view of the passions as enabling the soul to hold fast to virtue and knowledge. He also discusses Maximus' affinity with Augustine on the organic relationship between love and knowledge. This study leads smoothly into the final essay, &quot;Memory and the Christian Intellectual Life,&quot; which brings the themes explored throughout this collection full-circle. Here Wilken again emphasizes the complementary roles reason and affect play in the life of faith, and argues that religious traditions, with their long histories of lively critical debate and beloved role models held up for imitation, are invaluable in helping scholars understand religions. This appeal to tradition (helped along by reference to Augustine's understanding of authority) concludes with a call to contemporary students of Christianity to reclaim the richness of that tradition's biblical, patristic, and scholastic legacy. A scholar of early Christian literature could ask for no more bracing exhortation. <br />Kelley McCarthy Spoerl	2004-03-26

While devoting five chapters to the former and four to the latter, Widdicombe also deals in two intervening chapters with the significant Alexandrians in the generations separating them: Dionysius, Theognostus, and, more importantly, Arius. Following Rowan Williams, Widdicombe believes that Methodius sets the stage for Arius by sharpening of the distinction between God and the created order in his criticism of the Origen's doctrine of creation. Looking to the present theological concern for gender-specific language related to God, Widdicombe argues in a postscript that Father-Son language is integral to the Christian understanding of God as historically developed and that the figures with whom he is concerned &quot;avoid drawing on the biological or the psychological and sociological dimensions of human fatherhood&quot; in a way that would tie their theology of divine father to the Patriarchal institutions of their society.<br />Widdicombe states that &quot;For Athanasius, the word Father signified that the divine nature was both inherently generative, giving life to the Son and through him to all other things, and inherently relational, a relation of Father and Son in which mutual love is eternally both given and received&quot; (3). In giving divine fatherhood this importance, Athanasius evidences his indebtedness to Origen. Indeed, a thread of continuity linking the two is their insistence that, since fatherhood, an essential aspect of the godhead, is a correlative term, it implies an eternal generative relationship to the divine Son. Both men also taught that human salvation is fundamentally a process of being brought into the inner life of the Trinity through adoption as sons. Widdicombe thus argues that, for Origen no less than for Athanasius, Trintarian theology is grounded in soteriology. With regard to Origen, he states that, &quot;The Son is a model for our knowing and loving God, and therefore must be a subject of knowledge and love and have a hypostatic existence comparable to ours&quot; (90).<br />Widdicombe shows how Origen, even while drawing on Middle Platonic understandings of the ineffability and unnamability of God, took Plato to task for being insufficiently radical in his understanding of God's transcendence. Plato allowed that some few people could attain knowledge of God, even if doing so was very difficult, but, according to Origen, Christians do not believe that human understanding can reach God at all, even though such understanding is potentially accessible to all, not just to Plato's few, through grace mediated by the divine hypostases. Even while opening up the possibility of the knowledge of the many, Origen still made full entry of the divine Father-Son relationship depend on a protracted process of moral and intellectual purification. Thus, &quot;We come to know God as Father through a step-by-step progression to the status of adopted sons and thus to a share in the eternal relationship of the Father and the Son. Origen portrays this progression as a spiritual pilgrimage from the condition of fear, servitude, and ignorance which characterizes the Lord-servant relationship to that of filial knowledge and love which characterizes the Father-Son relationship. This pilgrimage involves a corresponding development in our moral behaviour: as we become morally pure, we grow in our knowledge of Wisdom and in our degree of sonship&quot; (93). An implication of this human entry into the divine Father-Son relationship is that &quot;God has not begotten justice once for all time, but is continuously generating justice in each good human act&quot; (97-98).<br />Drawing principally on the Contra Gentes, De Incarnatione, and Contra Arianos I-III (Widdicombe follows Christopher Stead in regarding Bk. III as genuine), discusses how Athanasius understood God as Father, related the Father to the Son, and describedhuman salvation in terms of an entry into their relationship. Widdicombe shows that Athanasius takes for granted much that Origen had to establish: the notion that Fatherhood implies generativity and love, the noncorporeal and transcendent character of divine fatherhood, the fact that it defines relations both in the Trinity and with us as sons by adoption. Unlike Origen, he does not understand salvation in terms of a gradual, stage-by-stage process of moral and intellectual purification.<br />Widdicombe makes a good case for his argument for continuity between Origen and Athanasius. He also demonstrates how both men were genuinely constrained by their respect for the evidence of the Bible in how they dealt with the difference the incarnation makes in the possibility for humans to enter into the divine Father-Son relationship. While it is fundamental for Origen to insist, against Marcion, on the identity of the God of the Old Testament with the God of the New Testament, nonetheless, &quot;The weight of the biblical evidence constrained him to identify the historical event of the incarnation as bringing to us the decisive knowledge of God as Father. Although he is adamantly opposed to the notion that there is an ontological disjunction between the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament, he perceived an epistemological disjunction between the two Testaments. The incarnation effects and ontological change in human nature, remaking us as sons, and thus it essentially transforms our relationship with God&quot; (117). Similarly, Athanasius, for whom the Son's taking on human flesh enables us to partake of divine being through the gift of the Holy Spirit at baptism, is constrained by the references to being filled with the Spirit and divinized in the Old Testament to admit their possibility before the coming of Christ.<br />Widdicombe's monograph is consistently well written and well argued, exhibiting a mastery of primary and secondary sources. Inevitably, the reviewer might wish that he had conceived his book slightly differently, giving more attention, say, to the Origen's use of the correlativity argument in relation to Creation and less to the title of the first chapter of De Principiis. Likewise, it might have been valuable to begin the study with an earlier Alexandrian, Clement of Alexandria, and to have discussed how Athanasius' ideas about human participation in the divine sonship play out in the Life of Arius. Even so, Widdicombe has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the Alexandrian tradition and its continuing relevance.<br />Joseph W.

For those of us who were coerced into some formal study of canon law, it is easy to forget that the various canons were often developed as the result of quite interesting concrete cases. Jane Merdinger focuses upon several examples of cases before ecclesiastical courts in Augustine's Africa as a means of illustrating the evolving relationship of the African church and the Apostolic See, not in doctrinal matters on which they generally agreed, but in practical matters of law on which there was often enough conflict.<br />The book is very well written and provides a fascinating insight into the development of canon law in the African Church and into the relations between the African Church and the Apostolic See in those years in which the authority of the papacy was just beginning to emerge. In this area which has been the grounds of dispute between Catholic and Protestant scholars, Merdinger moves with skill and even-handedness without, as far as I can tell, any partisan agenda. The discovery in the mid-1970's by Johannes Divjak of seventy-seven new letters of Augustine, which were first published in 1981 in CSEL and were re-edited in 1987 in BA, provides new evidence for the topic of Merdinger's research.<br />Her book is divided into two parts. The first part begins with a sketch of the history of early Christianity and then focuses upon the relations between Rome and Africa as seen from the writings of Tertullian, Cyprian, and Optatus as historical background for the second part in which the author examines the emergence of African appellate law and a series of ecclesiastical court cases. I had not expected to find this sort of topic so interesting, but Merdinger says of her work, \\"I take canon law down from the shelf, blow off the dust, and try to demonstrate just how lively the background for any particular issue could be\\" (xiii). And she does that most successfully!<br />The second part of the volume begins with the Council of Hippo in 393 at which Aurelius of Carthage, the primate of Africa, and his brilliant young colleague, Augustine of Hippo, established a program of reform for the African Church which entailed annual councils of bishops from the six provinces of Africa. In chapters six and seven Merdinger sketches the legislation regarding ecclesiastical appeals within Africa and that regarding overseas appeals. Chapters eight through eleven take up the particular cases of Apiarius, of Honorius, of Anthony of Fussala, and of Apiarius once again.<br />In 418 Apiarius, a priest of the town of Sicca Veneria, committed certain unspecified offenses, and when his bishop took action against him, he appealed to the bishop of Rome. Pope Zosimus sent to Africa Faustinus, an Italian bishop, along with two presbyters, to deal with the case, and they did so in a such a high-handed way that the African bishops balked--mainly because Faustinus rested his case upon canons supposedly from Nicaea, but actually from Sardica, as the records of the Africans showed.<br />The case of Honorius is known only through three of the Divjak letters. When the bishop of Caesarea in Mauretania died, the lower clergy and the people wanted to elect Honorius who was bishop of a nearby town, but the bishops of Mauretania refused to go against the canons of Nicaea which forbade the transferal of a bishop from one see to another. In this case the African bishops appealed to Rome, and Pope Zosimus appointed three African bishops as his envoys, namely, Augustine, Alypius, and Possidius.<br />Anthony was a young man from Augustine's own monastery whom Augustine ordained as bishop of Fussala; the young bishop proceeded to plunder his flock in a most outrageous manner. When Anthony was tried by a council of bishops, he appealed to Rome. The case which had previously been known only by Letter 209 is now much better known through Letter 20* of the newly discovered correspondence in which Augustine pleaded with the Roman matron, Fabiola, to use her influence with Pope Boniface to make the pope realize what a scoundrel Anthony was. The case shows that Augustine and Aurelius felt that they could turn to Rome for help and that they kept Apostolic See informed about all the details of a serious case.<br />After being removed from his position at Sicca Veneria in 419, Apiarius became a priest in Thabraca, to the west of Carthage on the coast, where he committed various (...) crimes, and after being excommunicated by his bishop, he appealed to Rome. Pope Celestine championed Apiarius' case and appointed the same Faustinus as his legate, but during his trial Apiarius confessed under cross-examination to a veritable pigsty of vices. Since Canon 5 of Nicaea had forbade any bishop to readmit to communion one excommunicated by another, the African bishops reminded Celestine of this provision in their letter to him and insisted that they never wanted to see Faustinus again.<br />Each of the cases which Merdinger has so carefully described illustrates the respect of the African Church for the Council of Nicaea as well as the African bishops' deference toward the Church of Rome along with an insistence upon their independence from Rome, especially when there was question of adjudicating an African case. On the other hand, the African bishops kept the Apostolic See informed and did not hesitate to ask it for help, when they needed it. The book closes with an epilogue on the Council of Hippo in 427, Augustine's last council, at the end of which he and Aurelius parted for the last time. All told, a very interesting, solid, and balanced study!<br />Roland J. Teske, S.Jn a most outrageous manner. When Anthony was tried by a council of bishops, he appealed to Rome.

Beginning with Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and passing into the florilegia, commentaries, and chronicles of the Byzantine world, doubts and speculations as to the provenance and authorship of the traditional corpus can be detected. D&ouml;llinger's nineteenth century hypothesis of a Hippolytus Romanus, the first &quot;anti-pope&quot; and author of a diverse body of Greek Christian literature, achieved canonical status among patristics scholars by the early twentieth century and continues to exert a strong influence over the field. Brent's scholarship is a child of this critical tradition, but with important emendations. The &quot;anti-pope&quot; idea has long since gone by the boards, and Brent is no exception. But in Brent's revision, the notion of a maladjusted Roman ecclesiastic who took on all comers has reached its ultimate reversal. Hippolytus of Rome, the &quot;presbyter&quot; and author, is depicted as the antithesis of a puritanical dissenter and has achieved the sublime status of an inter-denominational reconciler.<br />Neither is the nineteenth century view of the corpus accepted without significant deletions. Here the name of Pierre Nautin looms large. Brent takes seriously, as he should, the textual studies of the late forties and fifties, in which Nautin sought to establish the division of the corpus between two writers, one a Hippolytus Orientalis, the bishop of an unknown see, the other the ever-shadowy figure of Josephus of Rome. For Brent the corpus is to be divided, but between two Roman authors, indeed, between two members of the same &quot;house-school.&quot; The first, in acrimony as well as in time, remains anonymous, but the second is the tender and repentant Hippolytus, who sought throughout his writings (contra Noetum, in Danielem, de antichristo) to re-align the thought of his disaffected community with that of the wider Roman outlook. His editorial hand, according to Brent, can even be discerned in the works of his rambunctious predecessor, some of which were preserved incorrectly under Hippolytus' name. These works include a chronographical composition, parts of which found their way onto the side of the now-famous Roman statue which even today resides in the Vatican Library, an eschatological treatise de Universo, and the problem-child of the corpus, the text now known as the refutatio omnium haeresium, never transmitted under Hippolytus' name.<br />But Brent's deeper interests lie in his attempt to link particular sociological realities with the texts and to show how text and social analysis might combine to reorient our understanding of the early Roman communities. Remaining true to the D&ouml;llinger hypothesis in its broadest outlines, especially in its view that the principal extant documents were composed in Rome, he sets about to delineate Hippolytus' role in a &quot;fractionalized&quot; Church (P. Lampe's term). As a means of social reconstruction, he suggests several new and brilliant solutions to age-old Hippolytan problems, the most interesting of which is his proposal that the statue's title list, usually taken as the catalogue of a Hippolytus Romanus, represents the literary works of not one, but of several ancient authors (115-203). Not necessarily related to this project, but necessary to interpreting the statue as the symbol of a Church community, is his attempt to refute Margherita Guarducci's suggestion that the original venue of the statue was the library of the emperor Alexander Severus (222-235 C.E.) and her skepticism regarding the reliability of the records left by Pirro Ligorio, its sixteenth century discoverer. This he undertakes in detail and at length (3-115).<br />Brent's findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Rome's &quot;fractionalized&quot; Church is best explained by the existence of &quot;house-schools,&quot; each with its own &quot;president&quot; who bore episcopal authority. (2) Callistus, one such &quot;president,&quot; and the author of the refutatio, another &quot;president,&quot; clashed when Callistus admitted the excommunicated members of other house-schools to membership in his own school. Callistus was attempting to create a monarchical episcopate by his actions, demonstrating that monarchical episcopacy had not yet emerged in Rome (contra Lampe). (3) Hippolytus inherited the leadership of the community which had resisted Callistus' claims (368-457). He modified its theological concepts in the direction of Monarchianism, amended its paschal teachings, and generally attempted to adapt his own thinking to the new organizational realities of the Roman Church. The important traditio apostolica is part of a later pseudonymous stream of literature with unclear tributaries (184-97, 301-7, 458-540).<br />Brent's study is required reading for Hippolytan scholars, for those working in ante-Nicean studies, and for students of early ecclesiology. Unfortunately typographical errors abound and in some sections syntax is not a strength. But as the first grand-scale work in English in this century on the Hippolytus question, the significance of this complex and erudite book cannot be over-rated.<br />John A. Cerratoty.

He has designed 16 chapters, each with a distinctive title, painting, and theme all organized somewhat chronologically. In his introduction, Pelikan explains the timeliness of this study, citing diverse contemporary issues such as feminist scholarship, Marian apparitions and ecumenism. He devotes chapter 12 to Goethe's treatment of &quot;the Eternal Feminine&quot; in his Faust; and chapter 13 to the popularity of Marian apparitions since 1830. Pelikan's interest in ecumenism not only informs his treatment of Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant views but motivates this whole collection. Moreover, he broadens ecumenism to look at Christian relations with Judaism particularly in the first two chapters and then in chapter 5 to include an extended treatment of the treatment of Mary in the Qur'an.<br />Throughout Pelikan describes various presentations of Mary lucidly, perceptively, and, occasionally, provocatively. Although several of the chapters were written for other contexts, most chapters do reflect a common method. Both the professional scholar and the informed university student will recognize Pelikan's reliance on documented primary texts. He usually refers the reader to one pertinent scholarly treatment of the issue at stake. After two chapters dealing with the relative lack of detailed information in the New Testament, Pelikan goes on to describe the appropriation of themes and allusions in the Hebrew Scriptures by a process of &quot;creative amplification.&quot; To describe his own position on the development of doctrine, he appeals twice to the effective metaphor about a legend emerging like a pearl from a small irritant. One sign of this process is the exploitation of actual misreadings of the original language and in the manuscript traditions of the Latin Vulgate. He cites the issue of &quot;parthenos&quot; in Isaiah 7.14, the implications of the conjunction in Song of Songs 1.5 &quot;I am black and beautiful&quot; and the confusion at Genesis 3.15 over the gender of the pronoun. Unfortunately Pelikan does not apply his descriptive and textual skills to the apocryphal Protoevangelion of James which became a rich source of the legends and themes about Mary.<br />Pelikan demonstrates his knowledge of primary evidence in subsequent chapters. In chapters 10 and 12 he deals with Dante's Divine Comedy and Goethe's Faust. In chapter 5 he describes the Islamic treatment of Mary in the Qur'an with its respect for her simple obedience, perpetual virginity, and motherhood of Jesus as human.<br />Pelikan does relate specific themes of theological development to his approach. In Chapter 4 he deals briefly with the Theotokos mentioning the dispute at the Council of Ephesus in 431 but concentrating more on the antecedents of Cyril rather than on the crisis itself. This is surprising in view of the important difference with the Qur'an and the care he takes in chapter 11 to demonstrate the respect in Luther and in other reformers for Mary as Mother of God. Moreover the lack of a stronger focus on the Theotokos contributes to the omission of the significant Renaissance composition of the Madonna and Child. Instead most colored plates deal with the Annunciation and they should be incorporated within the discussion more effectively.<br />He does deal with a number of doctrinal issues such as his presentation of her status as second Eve, with a particularly appropriate illustration, in chapter 3. He treats Jerome's contribution to perpetual virginity and Ambrose's effort to accommodate a respect for the state of marriage in chapter 8, unfortunately without acknowledging some of the current scholarship in this sensitive area. In chapter 14, entitled &quot;the Great Exception&quot; he sketches the long history of the immaculate conception beginning with Carolingian monasticism, noting the reluctance of Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas Aquinas, and culminating with the Papal declaration of 1854. He sums up the theological issue lucidly but some of the texts in this chapter remain unidentified.<br />This book demonstrates scholarship in the service of understanding diverse religious and cultural traditions.

Section III, Jewish traditions in early Christian literature)	Books	5	35	35	N	N	Jewish Christian Origins	While this volume offers the combined efforts of the late David Flusser of Hebrew University and Huub van de Sandt of Tilburg University, the bulk of the work is actually that of Van de Sandt with Flusser responsible for the first draft of the section on the Greek text of the Didache found in Codex H (see 16-24) and the outline of chapters 4, 5, and 8 (of the book's nine chapters). Thus, the work is less a collaboration between colleagues and more the efforts of a diligent researcher and devoted student to frame and reshape the work of a specialist in late Judaism and early Christian traditions.<br />The book is well written, carefully argued, and beautifully published. Van de Sandt provides an impressive assimilation of Flusser's flowing literary style and insights on rabbinic literature into his own findings concerning the evolution of the Didache. The central premise focuses on the Jewish background of the so-called &quot;two ways&quot; tradition which lies behind the opening chapters of the Didache and of the ecclesiastical and liturgical materials of the subsequent chapters. Helpful guideposts appear throughout, primarily in the form of summaries at the beginning of chapters and before primary text divisions. There is a heavy dependence upon the traditional approaches of source, form, and redaction criticism combined with a particular concern for late Jewish texts and traditions.<br />Our authors argue that the Didache derives from a Jewish two ways tradition that was altered to include non-Jews (chs. 1-7), supplemented with materials of a traditional, liturgical design (ch. 8-10, 14-15; cf. 1 Tim. 2.1-3.13) to which concerns about traveling prophets were added (ch. 11-13), and was completed with an apocalypse (ch. 16) and evangelical section (1.3b-2.1). The setting for this effort was &quot;a rural Christian congregation&quot; in western Syria, perhaps &quot;in the borderland between Syria and Palestine&quot; (52) during a transitional period at the turn of the first century. A progressive explanation of the stages by which these materials were joined to form the final manuscript tradition appears throughout.<br />Chapter 1 explores the early use of the Didache, reviews evidence of direct and indirect witnesses to the tradition, and offers a discussion of the form and purpose of the work. Sample plates of Codex H are provided together with an English translation borrowed from the work of Fr. Aelred Cody of Saint Meinrad Archabbey (see also Kurt Niederwimmer's The Didache).<br />The heart of the book appears in chapters 2-5, which provide a discussion of the ancient two ways tradition including its nature and background, its role in Christian literature, a reconstruction of its earliest form, and the essence of its Jewish flavor. Van de Sandt argues that our &quot;best idea&quot; of the contents of the two ways is preserved in the Latin Doctrina Apostolorum (80) rather than in either the Didache or Barnabas 18-20. After its association with pre-baptismal instruction, the two ways was widely employed until the Merovingian and Carolingian periods. This section of the study is particularly instructive and impressive.<br />The remaining chapters are a collection of short essays devoted to other aspects of the two ways. Chapter 6 addresses the tradition's link with the Sermon on the Mount, drawing attention to how the teachings of Jesus employ Jewish materials. The tractate Derekh Erets is a measuring stick for this effort. Chapter 7 speaks to Didache 6.2-3 in light of the rise of Noachide laws within early Christian circles. Chapter 8 discusses Didache 7-10 against the customs of late Judaism; Van de Sandt holds that the food rituals seen here are an early form of the Eucharist. Chapter 9 considers Jewish factors in the ecclesiastical considerations of Didache 11-15. Inasmuch as it engages the developmental stages of the early ecclesiastical offices within the Church, the analysis in this section is somewhat complex and convoluted<br />Ultimately, the volume is a fine research effort which provides an intriguing view of the reconstructed traditions behind the Didache. The reader sometimes wonders if the title should not have been something like The Two Ways Tradition in Early Christian Literature: A Focus on the Didache, and I have some concern that the book includes no concluding chapter reviewing the evidence and summarizing its conclusions.

The result is a much stronger work, which will appeal to scholars of Late Antiquity more than the first edition while still captivating the general reader.<br />In the second edition Brown continues to treat the localization of Christianity in regions from the North Atlantic to Asia. He describes how Irishmen, Saxons, and others transferred to their homeland relics, styles of art and architecture, and ecclesiastical customs, thus believing that they &quot;had brought to their own region a 'microcosm' which reflected, with satisfactory completeness, the 'macrocosm' of a worldwide Christianity. . . . They strove to cancel out the hiatus between 'center' and 'periphery' by making 'little Romes' available on their home ground&quot; (15). Brown calls the local variations of a broader Christianity &quot;micro-Christendoms.&quot; In his characterization of the British Isles, he writes &quot;The religious leaders of every region claimed to possess at home a set of customs and doctrines which were ultimately derived from 'true' centers of Christian learning and practice in a wider world&quot; (359). Through statements like this, Brown tries to erase the model of thinking about Christianity in terms of &quot;center&quot; and &quot;periphery,&quot; a theory he borrows from anthropology and religious studies.<br />Yet, by entitling the work The Rise of Christianity in the West, the author reifies the notion of Christianity as a &quot;western&quot; phenomenon although a significant portion of the book treats the localization and perpetuation of Christianity in non-western regions such as Syria and Persia. In fact, his discussion of the climate of competition among religions in the East is every bit as penetrating as his examination of the West. A more fitting title to this abolition of core-periphery, therefore, might be Micro-Christendoms: Christianity and Diversity from 200-1000.<br />The first edition received mixed reviews. One historian of Late Antiquity wrote that &quot;. . . the exuberance and delight inherent in his interpretation . . . ought to make this book attractive and influential&quot; (Journal of Theological Studies 48.2 [1997], 671), while another scholar of the period claimed that &quot;its picture is skewed, and its conclusions are not demonstrated&quot; (American Historical Review 102.5 [1997], 1463). With this second edition, Brown will continue to elicit criticism from those believing that he is too theory-oriented at the expense of doing proper &quot;positivist&quot; work. On the other hand, many of the problems which scholars of Late Antiquity pointed out in the first edition focused on the lack of documentation, and it is here, among other places, that the second edition enhances the work. Although the original had no notes, this version has sixty pages detailing the author's sources. The first edition had a seven-page [End Page 139] bibliography with no primary sources; the second contains a forty-four page bibliography, including eleven pages of primary sources.<br />Another way in which Brown improves the second edition is by adding two new chapters, &quot;Powerhouses of Prayer: Monasticism in Western Europe&quot; and &quot;The Making of Sapiens: Religion and Culture in Continental Europe and in Ireland.&quot; He also amends his chapter &quot;Christianity in Asia&quot; and renames it &quot;Christianity in Asia and the Rise of Islam.&quot; And he divides the chapter &quot;Christianities of the North: Ireland and Saxon Britain&quot; into two separate chapters, treating local Christianity in each region more fully.<br />Furthermore, Brown refines the layout of the visual aids and adds to them. The first edition contained four maps at the beginning of the book whereas the second has ten maps placed strategically throughout the body of the text to correspond to the geographical areas under discussion. Likewise, the second edition has chronologies arranged within the narrative to give the reader a point of reference for the persons, places, and events being examined. These additions allow the reader to organize and contextualize the contents, a point which is especially helpful since the book covers such a broad period and has a vast regional scope. Finally, the placement of sub-headings throughout the text strengthens the structure of the second edition. The reader will find the sub-topics easier to configure within the broader thesis.<br />This book makes a useful text for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in religion and history. It is helpful for its survey of Christianity, the questions it raises regarding the relationship of religion to ethnicity and locality, and its notes and bibliography, which point to related studies. At $29.95, the paperback is a reasonable addition to the individual scholar's library.<br />Nathan Howardof the text to correspond to the geographical areas under discussion.

H. Williams is well positioned to write this book. He knows from the inside the suspicion (indeed, hostility) of many in the &quot;Free Church&quot; toward anything labeled tradition. Worried that the market-oriented approach to estab-lishing &quot;Bible-based&quot; churches will result in an increasingly sectarian model of the Church, he aims to show that only by taking on board the Church's Tradition (the common Christian tradition, as opposed to the traditions of various Christian groups) can evangelicals preserve a definitive theological center.<br />Williams claims that, despite their mistrust of the formal language of creeds, all the essential elements of evangelical theology are dependent on the Tradition enshrined in the Nicene or Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, rather than simply being drawn from the Bible (37). He shows that the earliest Church was guided by tradition expressed in the formulation of the Gospel, the messianic exegesis of the Old Testament, the survival of ancient confessional and hymnic materials in the New Testament, and the formation of the Christian canon itself. He makes the case that the efforts of Tertullian and Irenaeus to define the norms of the apostolic Rule of Faith were made necessary by claims and counterclaims of Gnostics, Marcionites, and others that the Bible supported their competing versions of truth. He shows that the need for catechetical instruction required the churches to distill the essentials of the faith into formulaic constructs. His delicate task here is to show that the various summaries of the Rule of Faith were all intended as condensations of the apostolic Tradition existing alongside, but not displacing, scripture.<br />Next he tackles the notion, widespread among Free Church evangelicals, that the &quot;pristine&quot; Church of the New Testament period fell into corruption shortly thereafter, particularly as it accommodated itself to the empire during Constantine's rule. He sharply critiques examples of Free Church historiography that attempt to trace out a pure line of apostolic Christianity (represented by the Poor of Lyons, the Albigensians, Waldensians, Hus, Wycliffe, and others) preserved against the slide of the Church into the apostasy of papal absolutism.<br />Williams faces his most difficult task in chapter 5, where he devotes forty pages to responding to what he identifies as four theses implicit in the evangelical rejection of the ecumenical councils and creeds. In sum, this rejection is based on the misunderstanding that: (1) bishops of the late patristic period were tools of imperial and papal power rather than shepherds of the people; (2) the Nicene and post-Nicene creeds were political decisions that were meant to displace local church confessions; (3) the universal creeds dethroned scripture from its uniquely authoritative position. Williams maintains that during the post-Constantinian period the Church worked out definitive theological positions slowly, providentially, and, insofar as possible, consensually. Moreover, Constantine is not re-sponsible for the conception and wording of the Nicene Creed, which largely incorporated formulas in use in churches prior to 325 (except for the phrases &quot;true God from true God, &quot;from the substance of the Father,&quot; and &quot;of same substance of the Father&quot; [homoousios]).<br />The author then turns to the magisterial reformers to show that, however much they protested against the abuses of the pope, conciliar authorities, and clergy, Luther and Calvin both valued true catholicity and generally approved the doctrinal definitions of the first four general councils. Although Williams stops short of claiming that these same councils ought to define the faith for all believers, he does say that, &quot;The Tradition as found in the ancient confessions, the rule of faith, and the doctrinal theology of the Fathers provides truth about God. . . . These sources point us beyond ourselves and ask us to peer out from the confines of the Protestant 'ghettos' we have created into the main street of catholic Christianity&quot; (217).<br />As one of a growing tribe of self-confessed &quot;free church catholics&quot; (note the lower case), I find much to commend in this book. At the same time, it is unsettling to find the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), not only paired with Seventh Day Adventism as &quot;an emerging species of idiosyncratic Protestantism&quot; in the antebellum United States (19), but also consistently referred to as the Disciples of Christ (Christian Church). One could easily get the impression that the Disciples tradition should be understood solely in terms of its eighteenth-century origins, despite the long and distinguished history of the Disciples in ecumenical dialogue. Also, while I am glad to acknowledge the importance of the work of the first four great Church councils, I have reservations about the adequacy of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan formulation. The expression &quot;the Creed&quot; still means for me the &quot;Apostles' Creed.&quot; Perhaps, as a New Testament scholar, I am reluctant to submerge any of the Christological voices of scripture (and the early Church) under one orthodox formulation, especially one that retains the filioque phrase. But perhaps I am only resistant to Williams's very capable instruction.<br />Robert F. Hull, JrFathers provides truth about God. . . .

All were posthumously baptized-by proxy-by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. In the 1840s, Shakers similarly saw posthumous salvation as possible for Native Americans. The Shakers believed that the souls of dead Native Americans could possess them, and, as a result, these dead non-Christians could receive the gospel and experi-ence salvation. However alien or peculiar these practices may seem, both Mor-mons and Shakers grounded them in what they saw as first-century Christian claims that death represented a permeable boundary.<br />In early Christianity were dead non-Christians seen as permanently separated from God, perhaps in eternal torment? Or could they be saved posthumously? In Rescue for the Dead, Jeffrey A. Trumbower acknowledges the existence of both perspectives, but he highlights the latter, examining those references, traditions, and theological perspectives in early Christianity which seem to support the belief that at least some non-Christians could experience salvation after death. Trumbower does so by focusing not just on Marcion, Origen, and the so-called gnostic writings but also on the Shepherd of Hermas, the Martyrdom of Perpetua, the Acts ofPaul and Thecla, and the Apocalypse of Peter. Key passages in these writings are linked both to &quot;Greek, Roman, and Jewish Succor for the Dead&quot; and to relevant New Testament passages such as 1 Corinthians 15.29 (where Paul speaks of baptism on behalf of the dead) and 1 Peter 3.19-20 and 4.6 (which describe Jesus as proclaiming the gospel even to the dead).<br />Trumbower concludes Rescue for the Dead by acknowledging that &quot;although I have much sympathy for those in every age who have wished to rescue the dead, it is not the goal of this volume to take sides or to chart a course for Christian theology. Those who take on such a task, however, should be informed of the early history of the question in all its facets, and if this book has shed some light on that history, then it will have achieved its goals&quot; (155).<br />The book clearly accomplishes those goals. It should become a standard work for persons interested in issues of universalism either in the early church or, as Trumbower notes, in modernity. At the same time, as its closing words imply, the book does not read like a sustained argument with an explicit thesis. In part, this is because &quot;there was no clear uniform position on posthumous rescue for the pagan dead in the first four centuries of Christianity&quot; (84). As a result, many users of the volume may find individual chapters, which can stand alone, to be of particular interest. For instance, the reflections and research on the Perpetua and the Thecla literature are thorough and are of use to anyone studying these works. Furthermore, Trumbower's comparisons of Perpetua and Mormons, and his reflections on Gregory the Great's prayer for Trajan simply make for interesting reading. Although the analysis of the New Testament passages (especially 1 Corinthians and 1 Peter) is disappointingly thin, and although more discussion of these passages would have made chapter 2 particularly of interest to seminary students and ministers, Trumbower does include and highlight references to the most exhaustive exegetical discussions of these passages.<br />Readers engaged by Droge and Tabor's A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom among Christians and Jews in Antiquity will find Rescue for the Dead interesting in similar ways. Even though the two works focus on different phenomena, each reflects on Christian views of death. Each examines the historical development of a particular theological concept with attention to Greco-Roman and Jewish influences. Each explicitly claims that modern theological beliefs should be informed by the early church. Each highlights a perspective which has come to be marginalized but which seems to have been pervasive within the early church. In addition, at the end of each work Augustine is seen as the pivotal figure: his influence is presented as having resulted in the marginalization of a widely accepted Christian practice, either the acceptance of suicide or the belief in posthumous salvation.<br />Near the end of his book, Trumbower presents Augustine as speaking against every type of posthumous salvation described in early Christianity (125, 126-40). Beyond everything else, Rescue for the Dead seeks to ensure that Augustine's voice not drown out the recognition that &quot;the posthumous salvation of individual non-Christians was more widespread in early Christianity than is usually supposed&quot; (49). And that goal the work achieves very well.<br />Craig Wansinke been pervasive within the early church.

US	34236000	R3QS92MMRJ1ZER	0195217322	872518785	The Search for the Origins of Christian Worship: Sources and Methods for the Study of Early Liturgy	Books	5	86	87	N	N	A Revised Classic	When the first edition of this study appeared in 1992, the initial shock it caused was indicated in a review written by George Saint-Laurent for this journal: &quot;Tacit assumptions are spelled out, presuppositions are investigated, and long-standing hypotheses are proved to be attractive and imaginative but, alas, unsubstantiated by the evidence . . . . Indeed, this reviewer has been forced painfully to conclude that he must revise the content of his own courses in substantive ways and discard many of those cherished 'insights' which he has so confidently presented for years&quot; (JECS 2.3 [1994], 356). But Bradshaw's piercing methodological study of ancient Christian liturgiology has not yet had the impact it is due. Hence, ten years later he moves the following observation, without changing a word, from the midst of his first edition to page one of the second: &quot;While conscious reflection on the methodologies appropriate to the discipline has constituted a significant element in scholarly research in such areas as biblical studies and ecclesiastical history in the course of recent decades, the same has not really been true in the field of liturgical history.&quot;<br />Nonetheless, a growing number of scholars are coming to share the main points of Bradshaw's thesis: when the fragmentary nature of the evidence and the problems of interpreting it are adequately taken into account, rather little can be known about Christian worship in the first several centuries. What we do know points to diversity of liturgical practices rather than uniformity. Hence, the notion that &quot;a single coherent line of liturgical evolution can be traced from the apostolic age to the fourth century&quot; must be scrapped (ix). Bradshaw powerfully proves these points with his penetrating and, at times, devastating reviews of secondary studies and thorough analyses of primary sources. Indeed, he has set the standard for future research on ancient liturgy; any scholar who ignores this foundational work risks laboring in vain.<br />This second edition has been expanded and restructured with very little taken out but much added. Bradshaw has amended the following chapters to include important research from the past decade: &quot;Worship in the New Testament,&quot; &quot;Liturgy and Time,&quot; &quot;Ancient Church Orders,&quot; and &quot;The Background of Early Christian Worship&quot; (formerly &quot;The Jewish Background of Christian Worship,&quot; now renamed to accommodate a brief section on pagan influence). The chapter on ancient church orders, which has been enriched by Bradshaw's ongoing studies of the Apostolic Tradition, is the most authoritative and concise introduction to the documents, the scholarship, and the continuing enigmas of this odd genre. He arranges the chapters on Christian Initiation, the Eucharist, and &quot;Other Major Liturgical Sources&quot; by geographical provenance, thereby highlighting the differences in liturgical practices among various communities.<br />The first chapter, &quot;Shifting Scholarly Perspectives,&quot; has seen the most revision. It has absorbed the chapter previously entitled &quot;Ten Principles for Interpreting Early Christian Liturgical Evidence.&quot; One can still discern the &quot;ten principles&quot; although they are presented under different forms and not enumerated as such. Bradshaw restructures the chapter so that it focuses on the methodologies employed by liturgical historians: philological, structuralist (Dix), organic (Baumstark), and comparative (Mateos, Taft). He then recommends the hermeneutics of suspicion for dissipating the naivet&eacute; with which previous scholars have approached the sources. The chapter on the Eucharist similarly reads as a fascinating review of scholarship. Perhaps the most significant additions are drawn from Enrico Mazza's work, in light of which Bradshaw expands his conclusions on the development of Eucharistic prayers.<br />The final two chapters didnot appear in any form in the first edition. Devoted to Christian ministry, the first of these dwells on the roles of deacons, presbyters, bishops, and priests in both Latin and Greek sources. The second and last chapter investigates &quot;The Effects of the Coming of Christendom in the Fourth Century.&quot; It differs markedly from the other chapters, for in it Bradshaw does not review scholarship so much as provide his own theories regarding post-Nicene Christian worship. While cautioning against overstating the differences between pre- and post-Nicene worship, he argues that the influx of new members did result in some radical changes. Pagan influences crept in while the questionable moral comportment of many new converts led to changes in the understanding and structure of key rituals. Bradshaw refers to such developments as &quot;seeds of further liturgical destruction&quot; (219) and finds evidence of a &quot;tendency towards disintegration . . . rather than the full flowering of the Christian vision&quot; (213).<br />In the light of the preceding chapters, one sees Bradshaw's own scholarly skepticism folding back on him. How can he speak of &quot;the Christian vision&quot; after going to such great lengths to emphasize the diversity of Christian liturgical practices and theologies? And in the use of such evaluative terms as &quot;disintegration&quot; and &quot;destruction,&quot; can one detect the very type of unwarranted presuppositions that Bradshaw so frequently exposes in other scholars? Despite such unguarded moments, this final chapter proves a splendid capstone to Bradshaw's study. For in it he offers possible explanations of the apparent unity in post-Nicene liturgy that many scholars have erroneously assumed indicates unity in the preceding centuries.<br />This book is truly a model of method. It constitutes a sweeping summary and evaluation of over a century of scholarship on early Christian worship and an exemplary exploration of the primary sources by the person who currently is the master of the field. This is an indispensable methodological guide for any serious scholar investigating the first centuries of Christian liturgy and an obvious springboard for teaching the topic to graduate students.

It is probably not accidental that the burgeoning interest in canonical issues coincided with the discovery (beginning in 1947) and publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls, in which &quot;canonical&quot; and &quot;non-canonical&quot; writings appear in great quantity in the same location. Indeed, of the 511 items in the bibliography of this book, 471 were published after 1950. This collection of 32 essays traces the contours of the contemporary debate in admirable detail.<br />Even the section titles hint at the unsettling of old conventions. Following the introduction, part two is labeled &quot;The Old/First Testament Canon,&quot; and part three is &quot;The New/Second Testament Canon.&quot; In the essays themselves, however, only James Sanders adopts these neologisms, and he only partially; even the Jewish contributors to the volume continue to use the conventional designations, &quot;Old Testament&quot; and &quot;New Testament.&quot;<br />In the introduction McDonald and Sanders outline eight major questions in the debate, which can be collapsed into five: 1) What is the relationship between &quot;scripture&quot; and &quot;canon&quot;? 2) What is the scope of the respective OT and NT canons? 3) In view of the high profile of some non-canonical gospels in research on the life of Jesus, should the gospel canon be expanded? 4) Which form of the text is canonical, i.e., the most ancient form (as critically reconstructed), the final form (as known at the time of closure), or some other form? 5) What were the criteria for determining canonicity, and how should these criteria be evaluated by contemporary Jewish and Christian communities? These and related questions are central to the 15 essays on the OT canon and the 16 on the NT. The references that follow illustrate how lively and controversial the discussion remains.<br />Eugene Ulrich (&quot;The Notion and Definition of Canon&quot;) claims that three elements are essential to the definition of canon. &quot;First, the canon involves books, not the textual form of the books; secondly, it requires reflective judgment; and thirdly, it denotes a closed list&quot; (34). But Eldon Jay Epp asks, &quot;When two meaningful variants occur in an authoritative writing, which reading is canonical, or are both canonical? (512). That is, is the &quot;reflective judgment&quot; that yields canonical authority for a book different somehow from the reflective judgments that have given us variant forms of biblical texts? The status of the Septuagint in both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity shows that Epp's question goes far beyond the issue of individual variant readings. Essays by Albert Sundberg (&quot;The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism&quot;), Emmanuel Tov, (&quot;The Status of the Masoretic Text in Modern Text Editions of the Hebrew Bible: The Relevance of Canon&quot;), and Craig Evans (&quot;The Scripture of Jesus and His Earliest Followers&quot;) all point to the indissoluble connection between text and canon.<br />With respect to the criterion of a &quot;closed list,&quot; some contributors suggest that the canon is much more about process than product (James Sanders, &quot;The Issue of Closure in the Canonical Process,&quot; Joseph Blenkinsopp, &quot;The Formation of the Hebrew Bible Canon: Isaiah as a Test Case&quot;). The relevant importance of closure separates those who view the decisive period of canon formation as the second century (Everett Ferguson, &quot;Factors Leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon,&quot; Peter Balla, &quot;Evidence for an Early Christian Canon [Second and Third Century]) from those who judge the fourth century as the crucial era (Albert Sundberg, &quot;The Septuagint . . . ,&quot; Geoffrey Mark Hahne-man, &quot;The Muratorian Fragment and the Origins ofthe New Testament Canon&quot;). In sum, however much we may wish, with Ulrich, to &quot;formulate and agree upon a precise definition of the canon of scripture for the sake of clarity, consistency, and constructive dialogue&quot; (35), this is probably too much to hope for.<br />Nevertheless, this collection does offer much constructive dialogue and advances the debate about the canon in several particulars: 1) It subjects conventional arguments to fresh and vigorous re-examination (Steve Mason, &quot;Josephus and His Twenty-Two Book Canon,&quot; John Barton, &quot;Marcion Revisited&quot;); 2) It underscores the vital relationship between textual criticism, codicology, and canon formation (Robert Kraft, &quot;The Codex and Canon Consciousness,&quot; Daryl Schmidt, &quot;The Greek New Testament as a Codex,&quot; Eldon Jay Epp, &quot;Issues in the Interrelationship of New Testament Textual Criticism and Canon,&quot;); 3) It provides up-to-date surveys of scholarship on a number of ancillary issues (James VanderKam, &quot;Questions of Canon Viewed through the Dead Sea Scrolls,&quot; Pheme Perkins, &quot;Gnosticism and the Christian Bible,&quot; Kent Clarke, &quot;The Problem of Pseudonymity in Biblical Literature and Its Implications for Canon Formation&quot;). Best of all, it offers the mature scholarship of the most seasoned veterans of canon research. A good two-thirds of the contributors are either emeritus faculty or senior scholars; and they represent an international, interconfessional, and theologically varied field. They are not only willing to engage each other in dialogue but to respond to and carry forward their own earlier research and reflections (Jack Lewis, &quot;Jamnia Revisited,&quot; James Dunn, &quot;Has the Canon a Continuing Function?&quot;).<br />The end matter is almost worth the price of the book. Lee McDonald has assembled appendices in which are collected primary sources for canon study and lists of catalogs for both the OT and NT canons.

Hull, Jr.s of the New Testament Canon&quot;). In sum, however much we may wish, with Ulrich, to &quot;formulate and agree upon a precise definition of the canon of scripture for the sake of clarity, consistency, and constructive dialogue&quot; (35), this is probably too much to hope for. <br />Nevertheless, this collection does offer much constructive dialogue and advances the debate about the canon in several particulars: 1) It subjects conventional arguments to fresh and vigorous re-examination (Steve Mason, &quot;Josephus and His Twenty-Two Book Canon,&quot; John Barton, &quot;Marcion Revisited&quot;); 2) It underscores the vital relationship between textual criticism, codicology, and canon formation (Robert Kraft, &quot;The Codex and Canon Consciousness,&quot; Daryl Schmidt, &quot;The Greek New Testament as a Codex,&quot; Eldon Jay Epp, &quot;Issues in the Interrelationship of New Testament Textual Criticism and Canon,&quot;); 3) It provides up-to-date surveys of scholarship on a number of ancillary issues (James VanderKam, &quot;Questions of Canon Viewed through the Dead Sea Scrolls,&quot; Pheme Perkins, &quot;Gnosticism and the Christian Bible,&quot; Kent Clarke, &quot;The Problem of Pseudonymity in Biblical Literature and Its Implications for Canon Formation&quot;). Best of all, it offers the mature scholarship of the most seasoned veterans of canon research. A good two-thirds of the contributors are either emeritus faculty or senior scholars; and they represent an international, interconfessional, and theologically varied field. They are not only willing to engage each other in dialogue but to respond to and carry forward their own earlier research and reflections (Jack Lewis, &quot;Jamnia Revisited,&quot; James Dunn, &quot;Has the Canon a Continuing Function?&quot;). <br />The end matter is almost worth the price of the book. Lee McDonald has assembled appendices in which are collected primary sources for canon study and lists of catalogs for both the OT and NT canons. In addition to the generous bibliography, there is a subject index, an index of modern authors, and an index of ancient and medieval sources. <br />Although not a reference work in the usual sense of the term, the range and depth of discussion of canonical concerns assure that this book will be used as a standard reference work for many years to come. <BR>Robert F.

It is very comprehensive. Those accustomed to using one-volume dictionaries of the papacy (J. N. D. Kelly, Richard McBrien, Claudio Rendina) will be pleased to see entries that run to several pages for important popes such as Damasus I or Leo I. The work contains entries for all of the popes as well as articles on the usual topics like primacy and infallibility but also on \\"Greeks in Italy,\\" which deals briefly with the immense impact of Greek clerics and even several Greek popes (not necessarily from Greece but from Greek-speaking areas such as Sicily) in the Early Middle Ages.<br />Not as unique but equally helpful are articles on the major Roman churches associated with the papacy such as Santa Maria Maggiore and Saint Paul's Outside the Walls. Articles appear on the visual arts including \\"Painting\\" and \\"Architecture, Papal,\\" but not articles on music or sculpture per se; the catacombs also rate a separate entry. As always, there are puzzles-no entry on Palestrina but one on the Vatican railroad station. There is also an entry \\"Castrati of the Papal Chapel,\\" surely a first.<br />JECS readers will be curious about entries on the early popes. The news is basically good. The contributors have done thorough jobs and include a great deal of information. The presentations are lucid and cover many aspects of the popes' lives and pontificates. The articles include much technical information such as the popes' involvement in financial and legal decisions or their involvement with the liturgy and church construction. Most of the secondary sources are French or at least European; few are North American although this is not unusual in European reference works. Just so many titles can be included in a bibliography, and the original audience was Francophone.<br />The primary sources do not appear at the end of the entries but are cited in the text. Readers can then turn to the list of abbreviations to check the originals. This is good practice. The information is there for the scholar who wants it, but the volumes are not burdened down with excess bibliographical references. This facility of use also extends to the indices, which are clear and easy to use.<br />My only reservation, and it is a major one, is the series' tendency to exclude items which reflect negatively on some popes. The word \\"exclude\\" is not chosen lightly because the omissions are of well-known facts. The article on Damasus I does not mention the two famous anecdotes always associated with him-his nickname of \\"the ladies' ear-tickler\\" and the observation by a noble pagan that he would be happy to become a Christian if he could live like the bishop of Rome. More seriously, the entry overlooks Damasus' repeated refusals of the requests of Basil the Great to help the Nicene cause in the Eastern regions of the empire because of the pope's obsession with who held the see of Antioch. The entry on Gregory I proves that he deserves the epithet \\"the Great\\" for his governance of the Roman church, his aid to the oppressed Italians, and his outreach to the barbarians, but the entry makes no mention of his rebuke to an Italian bishop for reading classical literature or his \\"unworthy jubilation\\" (J. N. D. Kelly) at hearing that the usurper Phocas had murdered the emperor Maurice.<br />This approach reflects the days when Catholic scholars felt the way to make a pope look good was to avoid mentioning the bad. The contributors could have realized that acknowledging that the popes had faults does not diminish them but only makes them human. Unfortunately, this meliorism did not end with the ancient Church. John Paul II is appropriately heroic and widely beloved et cetera, but there is no mention of his refusal to let the Jesuits choose their own superior general and his imposition of his own candidate on the Society because he did not like the leading candidate forthe position.<br />The entry on Peter would have benefited from a good look at modern biblical scholarship. Peter's commissioning by Jesus (Matthew 16.18) is treated as an historical event despite the arguments of leading exegetes, including Roman Catholics, that this is a post-resurrection understanding by the evangelist.<br />There is an amazing article on Paul VI (1963-1978), particularly on Humanae Vitae, his 1968 encyclical on birth control. The author, the general editor himself, believes that the encyclical intended to establish a principle, not set down a law. Speaking of the difficulty Humanae Vitae encountered in Anglophone countries, Levillain says, \\"A law is to be obeyed, whereas a norm tends to inspire practice without imposing an obligation on the conscience. The distinction, incomprehensible to the Anglo-Saxon mentality (my emphasis), confounded the analysis, reduced the text to the level of the prescriptive and the binding, and undermined the authority of Rome\\" (1142). We may be able to understand why something so ridiculous and insulting appeared in the original, but how did it end up in an edition intended for Anglophone readers?<br />Given the size and depth of the articles, this three-volume set could have become a standard research and reference tool, but since the uncomprehending Anglo-Saxon mind considers objectivity a virtue in scholarly writing, the blatant editorializing in the articles will always make the learned reader wonder what has been left out. This is unfortunate, and it is annoying; I had truly hoped this work would be a valuable one.<br />The formidable price, understandable for so large a work, will make this more a tool for the university or seminary library than for private ownership.<br />Joseph F.

In this revision of her 1994 Harvard dissertation, Professor Frank has her scholarly sights fixed on the &quot;religious sensibilities&quot; of late ancient Christians, gleaned primarily (although not exclusively) from two Christian accounts of pilgrimages to visit Egyptian monks in the fourth and fifth centuries: the anonymous Historia monachorum in Aegypto and Palladius' Historia Lausiaca. Frank's study aims at more than a description of the inner world of two Christian travelers, however: it seeks also to articulate how students of late ancient Christianity might write a historical account of &quot;religious experience&quot; without being naïve or essentialist. To this end, she employs tools of literary analysis, as well as social-historical and anthropological studies, to craft a narrative that is theoretically aware while remaining sympathetic to its subject. Through careful analysis of &quot;the poetics of pilgrims' writings&quot; (3), Frank pursues a finer understanding of &quot;the religious sensibilities behind pilgrimage to the living&quot; (31).<br />In chapter one, Frank places the practice and the literature of &quot;pilgrimage to the living&quot; in their social and literary contexts. Here she lays out some of the central themes that will emerge from her study: exoticism in these Christian travel writings, the &quot;biblical realism&quot; that informed and emerged from these texts, and the emphasis on visuality as the privileged transmitter of moral and divine truth.<br />The second chapter examines these historiai as means of &quot;cultural translation&quot; (37), mediating the foreignness of Egyptian asceticism to the more temperate climate of &quot;everyday&quot; Christians. Palladius and the anonymous author of the Historia monachorum emphasized and exoticized the spatial and temporal distance between the reader and the &quot;living saint,&quot; who inhabited a thoroughly biblical and miraculous world. According to Frank, the miraculous and exotic were familiar tropes from Hellenistic travel writing, and she concludes that these literary &quot;displacements&quot; served both to mediate the strangeness of the desert ascetic for a more worldly Christian audience and to allow that audience to &quot;experience&quot; the Bible in a new and thrilling register.<br />In chapter 3, Frank turns away from her historiai to other texts that recount travel (literal and figurative) to &quot;people,&quot; including mystical accounts of ascent to God (Gregory of Nyssa's Life of Moses ), visions of heroes and villains in para-dise and hell (the apocryphal Apocalypse of Paul ), and hagiographic accounts of pilgrimage to ascetic figures (Jerome's Life of Paul the First Hermit ). This particular concatenation of physical and spiritual &quot;travels&quot; allows Frank to isolate a persistently articulated desire on the part of the traveler: the desire to see the face of the object of travel and achieve thereby an ultimately salvific ex-perience.<br />The remaining chapters build on this insight. Chapter 4 asks why visuality was the preferred sensory idiom of the pilgrim's experience, while chapter 5 turns to the question of &quot;the ascetic face&quot; as the object of religious desire and medium of divine transformation. Through an examination of classical sources on &quot;the senses&quot; and the literature of pilgrimage to holy sites, Frank concludes in chapter 4 that, throughout antiquity, vision retained a peculiarly &quot;tactile&quot; quality, so that sight and touch together were means by which experience itself was encoded and understood. Through a reading of physiognomic literature, Frank determines in chapter 5 that &quot;the ascetic face&quot; was the site (and sight) at which Christians could best visualize, and appropriate, a desired &quot;biblical realism.&quot; For these pilgrim-authors, &quot;the face had become the canvas of biblical identity&quot;; as such, the saints' faces &quot;functioned as another tool by which to fragment and selectively reassemble the pilgrims' experiences&quot; (162-64). Through the faces of the living saints to whom they traveled (and whom they inscribed in their historiai ), these Christian authors &quot;found a language for portable sanctity&quot; (170).<br />The final chapter embeds these conclusions about the function of travel writing and Christian physiognomy into a broader theory of &quot;visual piety,&quot; by which Frank signals &quot;Christian practices in which a lingering gaze conjures a sacred presence&quot; (174). She considers the later Christian phenomena of relic and icon veneration, and suggests that &quot;by this tactile and conjuring eye of faith, pilgrims articulated a theology of vision that would find its fullest expression in the cult of icons&quot; (181).<br />One place where Frank's analysis loses some traction is in the use of non-Christian sources to inform Christian texts. It is unclear how she envisions the literary or contextual relationship between these bodies of literature: Is it a question of cultural &quot;appropriation&quot; or &quot;background&quot; (see 32)? Are we to imag-ine a common &quot;affinity&quot; or &quot;resemblance&quot; (56-58) between world-views, &quot;echoes&quot; (129), or a wholesale &quot;Christianization&quot; of pagan sensibilities (163)? Her use of diverse non-Christian sources is at times ingenious and illuminating (the use of physiognomic literature is particularly deft), but in her careful tri-angulation of literature, experience, and world-view, the confrontation of poten-tially competing or complementary literatures, experiences, and world-views could only enrich her study.<br />This is, however, an extremely minor quibble. The graceful language and use of both Christian and non-Christian sources, from Phlegon of Tralles to Euna-pius of Sardis, make this volume a fitting addition to Peter Brown's Transformation of the Classical Heritage series. Throughout the work, Frank is refreshingly consistent in both her critical reading and sympathetic approach to ancient religious experiences.

There is some tension between this book's place in a series and Behr's own project. Though he says &quot;that more attention has been given to understanding earlier writers on their own terms rather than as stages on the way to later landmarks, such as Nicaea and Chalcedon&quot; (5-6), he sometimes slips into the latter approach (for example, 75-76 and 200-201).<br />Behr attempts neither a history of dogma nor a typical patrology. Instead, he offers a provocative thesis which I would summarize as follows: the main line of development in Christian theology portrays Christ incarnate as the argument, the &quot;hypothesis&quot; of Scripture, that is, of the Old Testament, now come in history, and theology remained safely orthodox only when it maintained that living link to Scripture.<br />Behr cites Aristotle on the role of hypotheses as &quot;the starting points or first principles (archai) of demonstrations&quot; (32), and he continues the interplay of Scripture and the canon of faith throughout the book, most effectively in the section on Christ in the New Testament and the chapter on Irenaeus. This approach enables him to give the most straightforward account I have seen of Irenaeus' doctrine of &quot;recapitulation&quot; (123-30), and it provides good insight into the aims of Origen (169), which could have been developed further in a different sort of book. Other chapters address Ignatius of Antioch, whose letters are treated as kerygma rather than as works of circumstance; Justin; &quot;Hippolytus and the Roman Debates&quot;; and Paul of Samosata. The eclecticism is justified by the working out of Behr's thesis, not that evidence for it was unavailable in Theophilus, Tertullian, Cyprian, or Lactantius, but that the chosen authors provided enough and seem to be related. I think that the overall thesis deserves extended consideration as a hermeneutical key to ante-Nicene Christian theology, and I hope to see it examined further both by Behr and by others.<br />Behr makes certain critical decisions, as everyone must: he considers Irenaeus' Demonstration earlier than the Against Heresies (112); he ascribes the Contra Noetum to Hippolytus without hesitation (146; 156); and he accepts the correspondence between Dionysius of Rome and Dionysius of Alexandria as authentic, while recognizing the doubts of Abramowski and Heil (202). These are disputed issues, and one takes one's chances.<br />My own main questions about Behr's argument concern Justin. For one thing, more respect should be given to the genres of the Apologies and the Dialogue: Justin calls Christ &quot;teacher&quot; in the former, but not in the latter (101, n. 21), and there is no good reason to conclude that &quot;for Justin, Christ is primarily the teacher&quot; (105). In neither genre does Justin need to deal with Paul or John, so there are no grounds for saying that he &quot;seemed reluctant to handle&quot; their texts (113). Albert Houssiau pointed out long ago that for Justin the saints of old saw the Word, but for Irenaeus they saw prophetic visions of the Word incarnate. Behr values this contrast but goes too far when he sees in Irenaeus no &quot;continuity of personal subject acting throughout time in different ways and revealing God in a variety of forms&quot; (116; see his citation from AH 4.9.1 on p. 115). And I would still concur with Houssiau that the logos spermatikos should not be conflated with the theme of pagan borrowings from Moses, as Behr does on 108-9.<br />I believe that Behr is onto something important with his thesis about the argument of Scripture and its central role in understanding ante-Nicene developments. Any problems of detail in his presentation tend to highlight the theological significance of Behr's approach and make it easier to argue in concrete terms about what it means. This book is a welcome addition to the resources available for graduate classes in patristics.<br />Michael Slusserght the theological significance of Behr's approach and make it easier to argue in concrete terms about what it means.

Is it possible that this period, once considered foundational for Christian piety, can have anything to say to the postmodern world? Robert Wilken argues gently but passionately that it can, and focuses his erudition and lucid style on defending the point.<br />This supplicatio for patristic theology is a collection of eight previously published essays. It begins with Wilken's 1989 presidential address to the American Academy of Religion, \\"Who Will Speak for the Religious Traditions?\\" where he argued that the post-Enlightenment academic discourse into which the study of religion has fallen marginalizes the real character and experience of religion for the sake of the researcher's objective distance. Modern teaching about religion, he says, is too often teaching about something else. This collection of essays, by contrast, defends the place of religious truth, both dogma and experience, within the conversation of religious studies.<br />Wilken's point gains strength in the common issues of the pre- and postChristian societies of antiquity and modernity. His essays focus on the issues which persistently occupy contemporary theology: pluralism, relativism, monotheism, and Jewish-Christian relations. This collection argues that early Christianity's treatment of these issues is an essential resource for contemporary Christian reflection. The bracketing essays of chapters 1 and 8 argue that in embracing the rational method and secular discourse of modernity, Christianity has deprived itself of a necessary past, a way of knowing and a way of speaking (that is, a tradition) which makes it possible for it to navigate present and future history.<br />Each of the essays, therefore, is both an exercise in historical theology and a bid for the relevance of the tradition. Chapters 2 and 3 point out that one of the first challenges of pagan thinkers to Christianity was that of exclusivity. Focusing on Celsus and Origen and Porphyry and Augustine, Wilken notes that early Christian apologists resisted philosophical claims that the various religions of the Roman Empire are diverse but equal roads to piety, and argues that religious practices and beliefs should be evaluated in light of the one true God. \\"In this,\\" concludes Wilken, \\"they were correct, and their judgments have stood the test of time\\" (p. 45). Chapter 3 (\\"No Other Gods\\") calls upon the early Christian defense of monotheism as a resistance to the idolatry of secular modernism, while chapter 4 (\\"Not a Solitary God: The Triune God of the Bible\\") invokes Gregory of Nazianzus's emphasis on the indispensability and particularity of scriptural language. The next three chapters touch on various topics of patristic theology. Chapter 5 examines early Christian and Jewish exegetical treatment of biblical promise, chapter 6 examines the mimetic character of the saints' lives in Christian moral development, and chapter 7 treats asceticism and holy eros.<br />To some these essays will seem excessively confessional, homiletical, and filled with Christian triumphalism. Wilken, however, provides an interestingly postmodern justification for his approach. Knowledge, he argues, is not a matter of abstraction or disembodied ratiocination: \\"It is found within rather than outside of things,\\" and \\"only in the act of doing and participating do we truly know and understand\\" (p. 171). These essays are exercises in patristics of the old school, in which patristics was a branch and indispensable tool of theology. However, while Wilken's appeal for the Christian past is at times nostalgic, his arguments and exempla have a surprising cogency in contemporary discourse.<br />ROBERT J.

Most primary sources are not translated and lack critical editions. Secondary literature is often difficult to obtain.

While some scholars may disagree with Herrin's historical interpretations, approaches to specific subjects, and citations of certain facts, her work on Byzantine imperial women should be regarded as an attempt to recreate and convey for the general reader the personal experience of women's life in the imperial courts of eighth- and ninth-century Byzantium.<br />The three main subjects of her study are the lives of the Byzantine empresses Irene, Euphrosyne, and Theodora. In each case, the book details their relationship to power and their influence on dynastic struggles, particularly emphasizing iconoclasm and the Empire's responses to foreign invasions. The author prefaces her discussion of these lives with an overview of early Byzantine history. At selected points in her study, she treats diverse topics to provide the reader with necessary background. These subjects include the place of eunuchs in imperial life, ecclesiastical organization, patronage, and family commemoration. The study includes a scholarly apparatus and annotated bibliography.<br />Herrin reaches conclusions about the ability of Irene, Euphrosyne, and Theodora to exercise power within a society in which constructed and assigned gender roles subordinated women to male domination. Herrin attributes this power to an availability of three main resources that allow these empresses to legitimate their exceptional behavior. She terms these resources collectively as the &quot;imperial feminine&quot; (241): the existence of female power figures and symbols, particularly the Virgin Mary, the divine protector of Constantinople; the essential role of women in constructing imperial dynasties through their fecundity within the context of a centralized court and restrictions on selections of spouses; and the tradition of female imperial patronage in establishing religious institutions and acquiring urban space in the capital. The author views the long-term influences of the three empresses as contributing to the protection of Western Europe from an Islamic conquest and the preservation of figurative art.<br />While based in scholarship, the work is not intended to be definitive or exhaustive. In general, Herrin synthesizes her immense study of the primary and secondary literature, projects an individual vision onto the past, and makes a personal statement regarding the experiences of Byzantine women. In this work, the reader gains an understanding of the empresses, ladies in waiting, nuns, and others, as well as the author herself, since much of Herrin's own experience as a woman appears incorporated into the writing.<br />Some may object to this methodology. For a criticism of various historical points and understandings, Warren Treadgold's recent review provides a list (American Historical Review, February 2003, 238-39). There are professional historians who write in a detached manner about Byzantine women and the three empresses in question. These writings, however, are often specialized and intended for scholars with a considerable background in the literature.<br />Unlike these studies, the value of a personal statement is its vitality and strength in communicating with a wide circle of readers. Despite certain scientific shortcomings, this is a book with the potential to ignite a genuine interest in Byzantine studies and the general field of women's history. The value of Herrin's work is its effectiveness in conveying the experience of women within an alien culture, completely detached from the present, to the contemporary general reader. It would be an excellent work for introductory classes in historiography, feminist history, and Byzantine studies. The study might also serve as a means for men to apprehend something about the life of women in general, even if the historical context is one that is completely foreign.ght also serve as a means for men to apprehend something about the life of women in general, even if the historical context is one that is completely foreign.	2004-03-23

Pieternella van Doorn-Harder has thankfully reversed that trend. She reminds us of early lessons: listen to those who live their own history, write what they have said and meant to say, and write without casting too much of a personal shadow on the text.<br />Van Doorn-Harder's academic rigor sets her in critical solidarity with the subjects of her study and their ecclesiastical institutions. Her direct writing style joined with life experience sets a sympathetic tone for a text whose dissertational structure might otherwise have proven dull and pedantic. She aims at highlighting and describing how contemporary contemplative and active Coptic nuns have developed their place in their church and in the context of modern Islamic Egypt. The roots of this monastic tradition are found in the lives of the earliest monks, Antony (251-356) and Pachomius (292-346). The author points out without ambiguity that there is little written history of Egyptian convents, except for scant references to the twelfth century. She concludes that this &quot;heritage is more or less confined to the centuries prior to the Arab invasion. What came after the invasion remains rather opaque&quot; (p. 33).<br />The modern Coptic monastic rule of life is not a set document as it is in the numerous contemplative and active communities of Roman Catholicism. The singular rule for Coptic monastics does not yet exist. References to early patristic tradition and the needs of present-day bishops in consultation with convent superiors establish lines of authority, prayer life, ascetic practices, and bread-and-butter issues. In the case of the active convents, the type of social involvement also shapes both their ascetic life and the economic requirements of daily living.<br />The nineteenth- and twentieth-century revival of the Coptic Church is at the source of new religious lifestyles. Contact with European convent life and the Egyptian Islamic context have helped shape the lives of these Coptic nuns. Questions confronting all religious orders in Christianity are raised: authority and its exercise, the role of women as role models and leaders, the relations with the non-Christian community, and finally, the demands of the spiritual life in a modern society: &quot;the key words for the situation of female monastics seem to be transition and redefinition&quot; (p. 197).<br />The author neither shirks nor skirts the difficult issues. She shows a prudent restraint in being nonjudgmental with questions of possible conflict. One example is male authority and female competence, about which Van DoornHarder states, &quot;This situation forms a potential source of friction within the highest levels of Coptic male hierarchy who on the basis of their interpretation of scripture, tradition, and culture, cannot tolerate self-reliant women&quot; (p. 201).

In line with the aim of that project,Jensen takes up its call to reconstruct &quot;the reality of feminine life,&quot; to make women &quot;visible as subjects of historical activity&quot; (p. xi).Jensen acknowledges that such research is partial but not biased; bias, she might argue, was more characteristic of the older apologetic approaches that claimed the Greco-Roman environment for the suppression of early Christianity's emancipatory tendencies.<br />That Jensen throughout emphasizes &quot;facts&quot; is the book's strength as well as its weakness: &quot;strength&quot; in that Jensen carefully sifts through the textual material remaining for her subject and period (largely pre-Constantinian), &quot;weakness&quot; in that there is little reckoning with the literary constructedness of the documents considered. Hence Jensen tends to understand the documents as more reflective of &quot;reality&quot; than would the present reviewer or many other Anglo-American scholars.<br />Jensen organizes her material into four substantive chapters: women in the church histories, women in martyrdom, charismatic prophetesses, and women represented as teachers (with emphasis on those usually categorized as Gnostics). An epilogue emphasizes the struggle between hierarchical and egalitarian patterns in early Christianity. Here, women are seen as complicit with ecclesiastical authority in allowing their already achieved emancipation (in the GrecoRoman environment) to be taken from them. Useful appendices give some of the important texts, and list by category all the women mentioned in the church histories.<br />In her chapter on the church histories, Jensen notes that Eusebius mentions more women than do Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret combined, with women martyrs holding pride of place. Especially surprising is the lack of attention to women ascetics in Sozomen's history, since he emphasizes ascetic and monastic phenomena. The church histories also appear to devalue women's education, lack of learning being represented as a &quot;specifically feminine virtue&quot; (p. 56). Gradually increasing hierarchical control over women's ecclesiastical activities is well documented. Jensen argues that many Christians of the era accorded women martyrs the same rank and privileges as their male counterparts.<br />Jensen's discussion of Montanist prophetesses is especially useful for its extensive treatment of the known literary evidence. Several commonly held views on Montanism are here laid to rest (for example, that the early movement was motivated by a strong expectation of the imminent end of the world). Following the suggestion of Heinrich Kraft, Jensen argues that Montanus was not the central prophetic authority in the early days of the movement. Rather Prisca was &quot;the real initiator and inspirer of the movement&quot; (p. 167). Not women's participation in particular, but the devaluation of charismatic authority in general, brought on the demise of the New Prophecy. The chapter on female teachers concentrates on Philomena and provides an illuminating discussion of this (allegedly &quot;Gnostic&quot;) woman's teaching. Philomena is seen as the teacher of Apelles, not simply as his female companion.<br />In addition to her careful dissection of documents, Jensen sets issues in a wider ecclesiastical and social context (although she perhaps separates &quot;Jewish&quot; from &quot;Greco-Roman&quot; elements too decidedly). With its stress on early Christian women as prophets, teachers, and representatives of Christ, this book indirectly counters the Vatican's arguments against women's ordination that appeal to the early Christian tradition. On several topics Jensen provides the fullest coverage of the literary remains pertaining to women of which I am aware. This book requires careful attention from scholars who teach and write about the history of early Christianity.<br />ELIZABETH A. Cr.nAR<br />Duke Universityaware.

Speicher has written a fine study of five female abolitionists-Angelina Grimke, Sarah Grimke, Lucretia Mott, Abby Kelley, and Sallie Holley. Her book is an important contribution to the history of antebellum nineteenth-century United States reform, women, and religion. First and foremost, Speicher places spirituality at the center of the women's lives. Intuitive rather than institutional, a deep and abiding faith guided their private and public character, so much so that their &quot;political activity was an outgrowth of their religious conviction.&quot; According to the author, recent feminist scholarship has often elided this point.<br />The book deftly weaves the biographies of each abolitionist with an exploration of political and social issues. Speicher provides a lively narrative of this group of like-minded females who all suffered from what she describes as a &quot;double-marginalization.&quot; Their marginalization was a direct result of their dedication to black freedom as well as their daring desire to speak in public about the terrible sin of slavery. The resultant denunciations from many ministers and fellow reformers bound the women tightly in a web of faith, love, support, and community. This community gave them the courage to persist and succeed. In turn, all would serve as mentors for the next generation of women activists, such as the Civil War figure Anna Dickinson. The Religious World of Antislavery Women is an excellent exploration of the link between thought and action in an era when religion endowed women with the power to protest as well as to pray.<br />Joan Waugh<br />University of California at Los Angeles	2004-03-23

Much theological material survives from then, but scholars have mostly used it for historical purposes, such as determining which church fathers the Irish knew. In this welcome, indeed overdue, volume, O'Laughlin examines theological themes. Throughout the book he struggles against modern perceptions of an idiosyncratic Celtic Church, &quot;an eco-friendly, Augustine-free zone without formal theology or law&quot; (19). This phenomenon has many parents from Irish Protestants who portrayed a national church that maintained its independence from Rome to contemporary New Age types who simply resent formality-and usually intellectuality-in religion. O'Loughlin argues for a distinctive Irish theology in the sense that every society has brought its cultural values to the understanding of Christianity. The Irish considered themselves part of the Western Church.<br />Two examples will show O'Loughlin's method. Adomnan of Iona (625-704) wrote De Locis Sanctis, about the Holy Land that he had never seen, yet this book became popular in the early Middle Ages. Adomnan applies Augustine's exegetical principles to his subject, and, &quot;teasing out references to places in the Fathers,&quot; he established the theological significance of specific sites. His description of salt &quot;fulfill(ed) a need, expressed by Augustine, for book on minerals mentioned in the Scriptures&quot; (80). O'Loughlin similarly demonstrated how the Collectio Canonum Hibernorum embodied not just a collection of legal decisions but also a particular theological stance, such as exalting virginity over marriage. All in all, a fine book by a leading scholar.<br />Joseph F. Kelly<br />John Carroll University	2004-03-23

The second part of the book is an impressive exhibition catalogue of Bibles and surprisingly diverse Reformation texts, filled with lovely illustrations, bibliographical information, and a superb historical narrative. Two scholars, Valerie R. Hotchkiss and David Price, are responsible for the insightful and learned descriptions affixed to each of the exhibition contributions. In a volume of this work, the illustrations often overshadow the appended descriptions; this is decidedly not the case here, for Hotchkiss and Price have provided a feast for both the eyes and the mind.<br />The first half of the volume is comprised of four essays concerning the world of the Renaissance and the Reformation that resulted in the publication of myriad translations and editions of the Bible. Jaroslav Pelikan draws on his earlier writings on the Bible, but the result is a fresh and stimulating prose that will serve to instruct and challenge readers. In his first essay, &quot;Sacred Philology,&quot; Pelikan charts the Renaissance scholars' recovery of the ancient languages, which culminated in a flood of biblical translations and editions and underpinned the ongoing canonical debates between Catholics and Protestants. The second essay, &quot;Exegesis and Hermeneutics,&quot; builds upon the first contribution, arguing that reformers such as Luther came to reject the binding authority of tradition in their exegesis and broke from the fourfold sense of medieval hermeneutics (the literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical). Instead, Scripture came to be interpreted-now in the grammatical, literal, and historical senses-in light of the &quot;analogy of faith.&quot; Using these tools of sacred philology and exegesis, those who translated Scripture had to determine the correct meaning of the biblical text and translate often complex doctrinal notions into the vernacular. In &quot;Bibles for the People,&quot; Pelikan provides a series of fascinating examples of just how difficult this could be, with sections devoted to the German, English, Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, and even the Natick-Algonquin Bibles. Bible translators were faced with numerous challenges (vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, for example) as they sought to translate the Bible, with its Protestant meaning, into new languages.<br />The final essay, &quot;The Bible and the Arts,&quot; addresses the &quot;cultural fallout&quot; of the Reformation-that is, the impact that the publication of Reformation Bibles had on art, music, and literature during the Reformation. Some of Europe's finest artists, such as Lucas Cranach and Albrecht Durer, made significant contributions to the genre of the illustrated Bible and assisted the reformers in their determined assault on Rome by providing graphic expressions of Reformation polemics. Literature and music too would come to reflect in countless ways the impact of the Reformation Bible. While the use of Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and German may hinder some readers, all can benefit from the author's vast knowledge which is communicated with eloquence.<br />JOY KAMMERLINGnating examples of just how difficult this could be, with sections devoted to the German, English, Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, and even the Natick-Algonquin Bibles.

The first volume, Reading Scripture with the Fathers, recounts the approaches to biblical exegesis of eight theologians of the catholic tradition. The third proposed volume, Praying with the Church Fathers, will examine the spiritual disciplines and worship of the ancient church. Learning Theology explores the major loci of Christian dogmatics, (for example, the Trinity, Christology, ecclesiology, soteriology) as articulated by major patristic theologians. Hall confesses up front the problematic nature of the division of the trilogy. On the one hand, the Fathers would not have separated dogma from Scripture. On the other hand, theology for the Fathers was never separated from the life of piety. Rather, faithful theology arises only out of the life of spiritual discipline and within the corporate worship of the Church. As a \\"primer for beginners,\\" Learning Theology must, for pedagogical purposes, operate within this artificial division.<br />One of the strengths of the book for which Hall deserves commendation is the range of the audience for whom he has written. Although he assumes that it might serve as an introduction for seminary students, it does not replace the classic introductory textbooks on patristics, such as J. N. D. Kelley's Early Christian Doctrine or Francis Young's From Nicaea to Chalcedon. Hall is not interested in explaining the historical development of Christian doctrine. The ideal audience for this volume is two fold: first, pastors who have been out of seminary for some time but now want to explore how the wisdom of the patristic traditions might aid their proclamation of the gospel; and second, curious laypersons who wish to explore the language of the Church they have heard in the creeds, hymns, or sermons but have never understood. More specifically, the pastors and laypeople to whom Hall is writing are those whose religious roots are evangelical. Himself an evangelical, Hall hopes to correct the tendency to place confidence in a \\"highly individualistic\\" approach to exegesis that suffers from \\"theological and historical amnesia\\" (24).<br />At the same time, Hall is conscious to address attitudes towards theology common among most contemporary Christians. He therefore begins his discussion of each locus explaining why it is relevant to the modern reader. For example, in his chapter on the Trinity, he begins by quoting Thomas Jefferson's dismissive judgment that the Trinity is \\"incomprehensible jargon\\" and Kant's insistence that the Trinity \\"provides nothing, absolutely nothing, of practical value\\" (53). Having exposed the reader's prejudice, he uses Nazianzen's Theological Orations and Augustine's De Trinitate to explicate the logic and boundaries for the Christian's contemplation of and speculation about the mystery that is the Trinity. Hall also demonstrates his sensitivity to problems in Christian God-talk that feminist theologians have pointed out.<br />My one major frustration with the book is the relative lack of historical context given to the texts and authors discussed. For example in his account of the Arian controversy, Hall gives his readers the impression that the Trinity and the divinity of the Son were not a problem for the early church until the third century. Although he makes a passing reference to Sabellianism, he offers no discussion of second-century views of adoptionism or modalism. Moreover, Hall's treatment of Arius's theology does not provide an explanation of why Arius and his followers denied the divinity of the Son. Hall's explanation that Arius wanted \\"to preserve God's simplicity and indivisibility\\" (36) does not give attention to the soteriological concerns (How can the savior die if he is divine?) that accompanied the philosophical and theological issues. This problem applies to his account, not simply of Arius, but of Athanasius as well. Hall focuses almost exclusively upon the intra-Trinitarian questions, omitting the soteriological issue that necessitated the divinity of the Son. By separating the doctrine of the Trinity from soteriology, Hall, contrary to his own goals, actually makes the debate about Trinity to be principally a philosophical dispute about the conditions for the divinity of the Son. Moreover, the conspicuous omission of any serious examination of certain major theologians, such as Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Theodore of Mopsuestia, means that Learning Theology does not provide readers with the multitextured and developmental character of patristic theology. This problem is particularly evident in his chapters on sin and grace, and eschatology. Unfortunately, the new student of theology will come away without a sense of the theology that provided the foundation for the ascetic piety that shaped monasticism East and West. Perhaps this will be coming in the third volume, Praying with the Church Fathers.<br />In spite of these issues, Hall has given evangelicals and nonevangelicals, clergy and laity alike, a helpful introduction to the world of early Christian doctrine-an introduction that both offers a sympathetic reading of patristic theology and is also sympathetic with the modern Western reader's frustration and confusion with the language of the ancient church that can seem so alien.pon the intra-Trinitarian questions, omitting the soteriological issue that necessitated the divinity of the Son.

US	34236000	R1I7MMDHCWOAEN	0664225101	575753546	The Heavenly Trumpet: John Chrysostom and the Art of Pauline Interpretation	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Chrysostom Studies	With the exacting and tenacious eye of a New Testament scholar, Margaret Mitchell has produced a magisterial study of Chrysostom's &quot;love affair&quot; with the apostle Paul. Gathering together all of Chrysostom's portraits of Paul, she argues persuasively that they must be understood rhetorically as encomia. The bulk of her study is thus devoted to the careful delineation of this traditional pattern and its variants. Not content, however, with the simple tabulation of tropes, Mitchell gracefully examines how a theory of portraiture animates these literary works. Many of the images she discusses make clear the reciprocal quality of Chrysostom's comments on Paul. As the Antiochene preacher reads Paul through the lens of his own experience, he produces portraits that bear as much his own likeness as that of the apostle. In this way, Mitchell's work represents an extended meditation on the act of interpretation, in the past as well as in our own day. Without delving into theories of authorial intent, her work contributes to the question of the role of the author in interpretation and the derivation of textual meaning.<br />Chapters 1 and 2 orient the reader by providing a critical overview first of Chrysostom's work and his rhetorical setting, and then of the rich background of literary portraiture.<br />Chapters 3 through 6 present and analyze the various portraits of Paul according to their size and scope, as well as according to the subcategories of ancient encomium. Chapter 3 discusses &quot;the miniatures,&quot; that is, the sixty-five different epithets, mostly biblically derived, that Chrysostom uses to describe Paul. Despite their typically Greco-Roman embellishment, Mitchell argues that these are not merely ornamental, but serve to evoke larger scriptural narratives. Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to full-scale portraits: first Paul's bodily features (which are painted with a notably ascetic cast [100]), and then aspects of his soul (which reveal the apostle's likeness, or even his superiority, to biblical figures [142]). In both instances, Chrysostom's goal is &quot;necromantic,&quot; that is, to bring the apostle vividly before his audience's eyes with the aim of effecting &quot;ethical and even political change&quot; (197, 133).<br />Chapter 6, by far the longest chapter at 180 pages, is devoted to portraits based upon &quot;external circumstances&quot; or biographical material. Here Mitchell makes her most trenchant case against Piedagnel (and others) that Chrysostom did indeed use the encomiastic form, even when &quot;rewriting the table of values upon which it was based&quot; (205, 378). Thus the Antiochene preacher trumpets Paul's low pedigree because its baseness serves to amplify the magnitude of his later achievements (217, 243) and prompts his audience to contemplate the divine power at work in Paul's life (226). This carefully worked section is particularly impressive in its treatment of &quot;variability&quot; in both Paul and John.<br />The final two chapters set Chrysostom's Pauline interpretation into its larger social context. Chapter 7 contributes to recent efforts to refigure exegetical strategies beyond the traditional polarity between allegory and literalism. Chapter 8 assesses Chrysostom's uniqueness as an interpreter of Paul by comparing his views with those of Augustine as well as those of some late-twentieth-century American Pauline scholars.<br />Appendix 1 provides a reliable and fresh translation of Chrysostom's de laudibus sancti Paul. Appendix 2 offers a catalogue and set of bibliographic resources for the artistic images of Chrysostom and Paul from the ninth to the fourteenth century invoked throughout the study.<br />Not least among the many virtues of this book is the sheer breadth of Mitchell's knowledge of Chrysostom's writing, which is all the more astonishing for being held so lightly. She draws far-reaching stylistic conclusions with scant fanfare, noting simply that they are &quot;customary&quot; in his speeches (158). In similar fashion, her footnotes are a model not only of thoroughness but of generosity with their suggestions and pointers for further study, so &quot;that other researchers may take them up in the future&quot; (xxv).<br />Calling John's hermeneutic a &quot;reading of resuscitation&quot; (1), Mitchell's study raises up the question of the effect of emotional attachment upon interpretation. Entertainment and catechesis were both crucial to his enterprise (32). While these values tend not to be featured in contemporary academic commentaries, Mitchell's prose, like John's, is punctuated with delightfully arresting images, as when she describes Paul's self-portrait as &quot;a kind of 'sidewalk art of the soul'&quot; (55). Nor does her work lack parenetic intent. By bringing the contextually rich framework of John's interpretation to light, she hopes to &quot;foster greater attention to Chrysostom's interpretation by New Testament scholars&quot; (xxi).<br />It seems churlish to find fault with a book that does so much so thoroughly. Yet one result of the meticulous tracing of forms is that most readers will be persuaded far before the analysis is concluded. Indeed, the organization of the book has a built-in redundancy, as material covered briefly in the discussion of the miniatures, for example, returns in greater detail in the full-scale portraits, and the analysis of the same rhetorical techniques recurs in the homily-by-homily discussion of Paul's body parts.<br />This reader, furthermore, wished for a fuller treatment of Chrysostom's historical context. For whereas 180 pages delve into the biographical portraits of Paul, the section in chapter 7 devoted to &quot;the social functions of Chrysostom's rhetorical art&quot; covers not quite four pages. There is thus little engagement with the realities of urban life in the midst of which Chrysostom preached, and yet surely this kind of rich detail would have furthered the goal of conjuring up the Antiochene preacher.<br />Mitchell's thorough investigation of Chrysostom's preaching provokes, but does not finally address, the fascinating and perhaps crucial question of where interpretation ends and inspired speech begins. But perhaps this is a topic for another volume.<br />Sure to be a standard resource for scholars in the field, this book, with its accessible style and wealth of information, can be profitably read by a wide range of students as well as by interested general readers.customary&quot; in his speeches (158).

There is thus little engagement with the realities of urban life in the midst of which Chrysostom preached, and yet surely this kind of rich detail would have furthered the goal ofconjuring up the Antiochene preacher.<br />Mitchell's thorough investigation of Chrysostom's preaching provokes, but does not finally address, the fascinating and perhaps crucial question of where interpretation ends and inspired speech begins. But perhaps this is a topic for another volume.<br />Sure to be a standard resource for scholars in the field, this book, with its accessible style and wealth of information, can be profitably read by a wide range of students as well as by interested general readers.	2004-03-23

Due to its mysterious nature, the borderline experience of death has always aroused not only curiosity for the unknown, but also the desire of the living not to allow the link of solidarity that binds them to those who have passed on to be interrupted, but to perpetuate it in some way.<br />Trumbower's fine work, newly published in the prestigious &quot;Oxford Studies in Historical Theology&quot; series, is dedicated to this fascinating theme. The author's interest was stimulated initially by the need to understand the real implications of the at first glance &quot;surprising&quot; prayer of the virgin Thecla, the disciple and companion of the apostle Paul, in favor of the deceased pagan Falconilla, a prayer quoted in the apocryphal Acts of Paul and Thecla (28-31) of the second century C.E. After a rapid but effective panoramic review of the Greco-Roman and Jewish world, Trumbower deals with the theme of the &quot;posthumous salvation of the non-Christian dead,&quot; starting from the New Testament and arriving at the late discussions on purgatory at the Council of Ferrara (1438), with some interesting observations even on modern and contemporary documents: a very long period of time, indeed! In eight agile chapters, he analyzes the developments of that belief over the centuries, its possible social implications, and the various cultural and theological environments in which it was expressed, and identifies at least four different types of doctrine on the salvation of non-believers after death: (1) scenarios of the last judgement in which the chosen can save part of the damned; (2) intercession for non-Christian dead by characters (fictitious ones such as Thecla or historic ones such as Perpetua), who possess the particular spiritual power of the confessors of the faith; (3) a general offer of salvation to the dead during Christ's descent to Hell; (4) philosophical and theological speculations on the justice of God and on the possibility of a final universal salvation even for the wicked.<br />The central thesis of the book is that, after the great variety of positions expressed in the first four centuries, especially due to the decisive influence of Augustine, in the medieval Latin West death was considered as an insuperable boundary beyond which no form of recovery is possible for those who have not been baptized and have not taken active steps to ensure their own salvation. On the other hand, the Byzantine East, while rejecting the idea of universal salvation, seems to have been on the whole more open towards alternative forms of salvation after death.<br />This work, carried on with sympathy and keen personal participation in the topic, is well written and a pleasure to read. The numerous ancient sources analyzed in the discussion are of various nature and origin: literary and epigraphic, pagan, biblical and Judaic, apocryphal, Gnostic, hagiographie; their interpretation is often problematic and controversial, but they are generally treated with prudence and equilibrium, thanks also to the use of a vast and highly qualified bibliography. A few slips may be easily corrected in a second edition: for instance, &quot;Pausanius&quot; (12 and 21) instead of the correct &quot;Pausanias&quot;; &quot;Perenzo&quot; (77) instead of &quot;Parenzo&quot;; &quot;lude more infantum, 8.3&quot; (86) instead of &quot;ludere more infantium, 8.4&quot;; &quot;Gosp. Thorn. 112&quot; (165, note 27) instead of &quot;114&quot;; &quot;Gregory Hoffmann&quot; (175, note 33 and 187: co-editor with L. Petit of the documents on Purgatory issued at the Ferrara/Florence Council), instead of George Hofmann; &quot;Pontificorum&quot; (187) instead of &quot;Pontificium&quot; (Institutum Studiorum Orientalium).<br />The prospects drawn up and the explanations proposed by Trumbower may also be enriched, confirmed or modified, by an apt reference to, and an in-depth study of, further texts that have not been directly considered in this book. For example, Pseudo-Hippolytus's homily, In Sanctum Pascha, chapter 58, could be usefully added to the already rich dossier of texts on the descensus ad inferos (chapter 5): here it is claimed that the purpose of Christ's descent to Hell was to save the entire human race that had lived before the Law, under the Law, and after the coming of Christ. As far as concerns the decisive role of Augustine, which is well illustrated in chapter 7, the Pelagian controversy certainly offered him more than one opportunity to define his rejection of the idea of a &quot;posthumous salvation.&quot; However, it should not be forgotten that this rejection was in some way connected with the criticism of the pagan survival of the cult of the dead, which Augustine had already developed during the last decade of the Fourth century. (See the classic book by V. Saxer, Morts, martyrs, reliques en Afrique chretienne aux premiers siecles. Les temoignages de Tertullien, Cyprien et Augustin a la lumiere de l'archeologie africaine [Paris: Beauchesne, 1980]). And quite apart from contingent polemical motivations, it was part of his doctrine of the &quot;universal damnation&quot; of the massa peccati, already clearly stated in the treatise Ad Simplicianum (396 C.E.). The difficulty Western theology at the end of the Fourth century had in understanding and preserving the traditional message of redemption implicit in the old doctrine of the descensus ad inferos is also proved by Rufinus of Aquileia's Commentary on the Apostles' Creed, chapter 18: here he claims that the meaning of the clause on the descent into Hell is the same as that contained in the clause on Christ's burial.<br />On the whole, Trumbower has written a dense and stimulating book, a clear and accessiblesynthesis. On the one hand this study reveals the author's familiarity with the Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian sources, while on the other it offers excellent updated historic information and casts new light on a delicate and important theme of Christian theology that every now and then returns strongly to the fore. The author seems to have perfectly achieved his aim.<br />Pier Franco Beatrice <BR>University of Padua, Italy	2004-03-23
US	34236000	RRSUW8HD7N1K2	0814719368	624573515	Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation Between Church and State (Critical America)	Books	5	37	40	N	N	The Wall	Thomas Jefferson's celebrated &quot;wall of separation&quot; metaphor has exerted a profound influence on American thought and practice regarding relations between church and state. This little book, thoroughly researched and carefully reasoned, examines the subject from several different perspectives. The author begins by analyzing the historical context of Jefferson's statement. Receiving a letter of courtesy from the Danbury Baptist Association, Jefferson consulted two cabinet officers on a draft response and replied within two days (on January 1, 1802) with a view to countering Federalist and clerical attacks on his supposed irreligion during the 1800 presidential election and to &quot;sowing useful truths &amp; principles among the people&quot; (25). In close scrutiny of the letter, Dreisbach shows that Jefferson agreed with the Baptists that religion is a matter of conscience and went on to say &quot;that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions,&quot; and that the American people had &quot;declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State&quot; (48, 148).<br />As Dreisbach contends, Jefferson interpreted the First Amendment as prohibiting Congress from establishing religion; thus it prohibited him as president from designating days of thanksgiving or prayer. But the amendment did not separate religion and civil government. As president, Jefferson attended religious services in the Capitol, and he used rhetoric with religious content in official utterances. Moreover, the First Amendment did not prohibit the states from legislating with respect to religion. As governor of Virginia, Jefferson had issued religious proclamations. In sum, the &quot;wall&quot; of the letter &quot;served primarily to separate state and nation in matters pertaining to religion, rather than to separate ecclesiastical and all governmental authorities&quot; (56).<br />A chapter considers uses of the &quot;wall of separation&quot; trope by Richard Hooker (1554-1600), Roger Williams (1603?-83), and James Burgh (1714-75), which Jefferson may have known. The author is unfortunately unclear and inconsistent as to whether Jefferson was familiar with Williams's use of the metaphor (78, 82). Another chapter shows that Jefferson and some worthy contemporaries used other metaphors to defend religious liberty-&quot;effectual barriers,&quot; &quot;great barriers,&quot; &quot;certain fences,&quot; and a &quot;line of separation&quot;-and that recent observers have suggested the concept of a zone between two walls in which church and state could interact-all this with a view to evaluating the desirable characteristics of a wall.<br />Jefferson's metaphor belatedly entered American thought and practice. His reply to the Danbury Baptists first became available to the public in Henry A. Washington's edition of Jefferson's works (1853; reprinted 1868 and 1871), and later in other editions of his writings. The phrase &quot;wall of separation&quot; first made its way into constitutional discourse when Chief justice Morrison R. Waite quoted the text in which it appeared in Reynolds v. United States (1879). Waite drew on Jefferson's letter to distinguish between the government's power to reach actions as opposed to opinions in a case involving the Mormon practice of polygamy. Waite placed no emphasis on the metaphor, but he declared that the Danbury letter &quot;may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the [first] amendment thus secured&quot; (98). Nearly seven decades later, in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), Justice Hugo L. Black, writing for the Supreme Court, invoked the Danbury letter's &quot;wall of separation&quot; passage. Black propelled the metaphor on its career of influence in legal, political, and religious discourse. In cases following Everson, the Supreme Court often cited the Danbury letter, and it became dogma, widely held. In time, however, justices began to protest that &quot;a rule of law should not be drawn from a figure of speech,&quot; and that the Court's task in resolving complicated cases was &quot;not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the 'wall of separation,' a phrase nowhere to be found in the Constitution&quot; (104). In 1985 then Justice William H. Rehnquist declared that &quot;the 'wall of separation between church and State' is a metaphor based on bad history, a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging. It should be frankly and explicitly abandoned&quot; (103, 105).<br />A final chapter addresses the perils and promises of metaphors. In law they are apt to mislead. As Stephen J. Safranek warned, &quot;the Court's abuse of metaphor will ultimately prove disastrous&quot; (116). The legal system depends on the use of language, Safranek added, but when the Supreme Court hides its decisions behind deceptive metaphors, it allows lawyers and jurists to hide behind this confusion and to focus on outcomes rather than reasoning. The &quot;wall,&quot; Dreisbach observes, has become &quot;the central icon of a strict separationist dogma that champions a secular polity in which religious influences are systematically stripped from public life&quot; (117). He concludes with an exemplary and evenhanded exposition of the case both for and against a wall.<br />The book's text (128 pages) is followed by an appendix (25 pages) of nine relevant documents from the papers of Jefferson, notes (86 pages), an excellent selected bibliography (24 pages), and a useful index (11 pages). The notes, which often explain at length matters treated in the text, are integral to the argument. Use of a key to frequently cited references and of ibid, where appropriate would avoid needless repetition in the notes. Daniel L.

Harrison accepts this basic approach; her Irish Christians consider themselves good members of the Western Church. But she makes a good case for their willingness to push the envelope, especially on the role of women.<br />Realizing that the traditional view has managed to hang on, she starts by debunking that view, yet she does so in a sympathetic way, acknowledging that it enjoys longevity largely because most books on Celtic Christianity for popular audiences are not written by scholars. She also puts to rest the notion that pagan attitudes toward women as powerful figures and avatars of earth religion influenced Christian attitudes. Yet if the sources of Irish Christian attitudes toward women were Christian, they were not the usual ones. Irish women had a freedom of movement as well as an acceptance by men unheard of on the continent. Why? Because \\"the builders of the new Irish Church adopted foreign ideas about women and holiness more selectively than has hitherto been imagined\\" (48). Harrison effectively demonstrates that the apocryphal Acts, known both early and well in Ireland, determined the view of women. Thus, Thecla and other women who evangelized, moved among the people, and worked with the male apostles provided the toposi for women's hagiography rather than the submissive, sheltered virgins of the continent.<br />This attitude maintained itself for centuries. Harrison focuses on Brigit, the best known of the women Irish saints and the one about whom the most was written. The vitae portray Brigit as an abbot of a double monastery, as an abbess who held her own and won the respect of male monks and as the superior of men who worked at the monastery or on its lands. Brigit's influence gave her church, Kildare, a status second to only one other church, Armagh, and Brigit's successors, both monastic and episcopal, managed to keep Armagh's primatial hopes at bay so effectively that an unknown Armagh writer composed a life in which Saint Patrick, traditional founder of the see, acknowledges that Brigit is supreme in the Kildare area. The Irish frequently settled controversial matters by literarily transferring them back to the time of the founders. This way the successors of Patrick could acknowledge Kildare's independence by following the saint's example. Indeed, so extensive was Brigit's posthumous influence that later hagiographers actually claimed that she had been consecrated a bishop. Significantly, the male hierarchy did not condemn these vitae, although they also avoided giving them credence.<br />This more open attitude toward women manifested itself in another very salubrious way. The great Irish male saints were all virgins, as one would expect, and every so often they encountered temptresses to their virtue. As Harrison points out, during the drive for celibacy in the eleventh century, continental hagiography frequently treats these women as hopeless harlots who deserve the beatings they get and who sometimes risk eternal perdition. But in the Irish lives, the male saints, after safely preserving their virtue, forgive the women, talk with them, urge them to a better life, and, in some cases, convince them to enter nunneries. Unlike Peter Damian, Irish reformers of this period managed to introduce celibacy without denouncing the lawfully married wives of priests as \\"whores, prostitutes . . . and chambers of filthy spirits\\" (270).<br />A substantial body of legal literature survives from early Christian Ireland, and Harrison writes considerably about the legal status of women. Much of it deals with property and family rights, such as whether a family could install one of its own as abbess and how the family could maintain the succession. Since headship of a monastery or nunnery brought great prestige to a family, issues of rank and stature also appeared in the law tracts. As continental influences grew, they threatened the status of the abbesses. In general, the abbesses held their own, relying upon a centuries-old tradition of active women who bore ecclesiastical responsibilities.<br />Harrison has done a very thorough job. She has researched extensively in the primary source material, and her bibliography shows her to be current with the secondary literature. She clearly demonstrates that the Irish Church followed the general trend of Latin Christianity-for example, there was no real thought of ordaining women-but it also gave women a leeway unknown in Romanist circles. Irish ecclesiastics seem to have avoided the petty, stupid misogyny that harassed so many Medieval women on a daily basis.<br />The book has only two real shortcomings, one stylistic, one historical. In her attempt to be thorough, Harrison has included material that does not advance her case, for example, the vita of Saint Gobnat or the abbey of Clonburren, which she could have relegated to an appendix and thus not detract from the main themes. She also could have spent more space than she does-and could have done so much earlier in the book-on the notion of Woman in Irish Christianity. The reader is uncertain what was the ideal held by both women and men in the Irish Church, and thus by what standard were women imaged. There are inevitably some small points about which one might quibble-why was Ian Bradley's superb Celtic Christianity: Making Myths and Chasing Dreams (1999) not included in the discussion of \\"modern Celts\\"-but these do not detract from Harrison's overall achievement.<br />This book has great value for students of Irish and Celtic Christianity; Anglo-Saxonists will also find it helpful as will all those interested in Medieval women's history. Alas, the price will deter many scholars; may we hope for a paperback edition?amily could maintain the succession.

The disclosure of these motivations-and the meanings and values associated with the buildings themselves-is the subject of Kilde's study of nineteenth-century evangelical architecture. Of particular interest to her are the changing politics of space: statements of power, authority, and relationship (between God, clergy, and laity-and with &quot;the world&quot;) made in stone, wood, and glass; the correlation of &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; designs; and the reciprocal influences between the style or function of worship and the disposition of the space. Although Kilde's study progresses from the Federalist style at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to the Gothic revival at roughly mid century, and to the neomedieval auditorium at century's end, throughout she keeps an eye on the theater-style church and the (internal and external) dynamics that brought its increasing popularity. Particularly interesting was her treatment of buildings associated with revivalist Charles Grandison Finney as a case study on the emergence of the theater design from experiments in the early decades of the century. Helpful as well was her discussion of the ongoing evolution of the theater style as it adjusted to meet the needs of revivalism and of the family-oriented congregation.<br />Because of her multidisciplinary approach, Kilde's well-researched contribution will be valuable to scholars of architectural history, cultural studies, church history, and liturgical studies. But such a broad approach across fields sometimes results in an overgeneralization of specialist terminology. A liturgical scholar will find troubling the use of &quot;cathedral&quot; to mean a large building, false distinctions between &quot;liturgical&quot; and &quot;non-liturgical,&quot; and reference throughout to the congregation as the &quot;audience&quot; even among evangelicals.urgical,&quot; and reference throughout to the congregation as the &quot;audience&quot; even among evangelicals.	2004-03-23

THis book, combined with his \\"Christianity, Social Tolorance, and Homosexuality\\", has done more to promote the legitimacy of homosexuality in theological terms than any other other, with Spong's half-baked attempts coming in a close second.<br />Please understand that I am not trying to bash gays or gays who are living the CHristian life. It is only that this sort of book misrepresents that tradition of the Church- east and west.<br />Read Boswell, by all means. But also read critiques. One very useful and kind critique is found in Marva Dawn's \\"Sexual Character\\" which goes into great detail about the scholarship of Boswell. I must say that the question is so very important to the Church and society and the Church should not be vindictive or loose withthe facts- but neither should those who disagree with the Tradition.<br />THere are several thorough reviews of Boswell's books at First THings so I won't repeat what is written there. However, I would suggest that we all need to be careful in reading into texts and history what would make us feel better about ourselves.

It is really the best book on the subject and I turn to it over and over again in my own research.

Recent years have brought forth several efforts to examine the attitude of Christian leaders in Germany toward the Nazis as they came to power in Germany. Equally interesting, but much more difficult to uncover, is the attitude of the Nazi leaders towards Christianity. As Richard Steigmann-Gall makes clear in The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945, the difficulty comes from the fact that there was not a unified \\"Nazi view\\" of Christianity. Some Nazis were pagans, others considered themselves to be Christians, and many shifted their views over time. As for the official position of the regime, Steigmann-Gall finds no evidence of a Nazi plan to rid Germany of all forms of Christianity. Rather, the plan was to eliminate Catholicism and to reshape Protestantism. Indeed, many National Socialists actually considered themselves to be good Christians. They were able to do so because they rejected the traditions and lines of authority within the existing Protestant and Catholic churches. Thus freed from hierarchy and tradition, they were able to interpret Scripture according to their own views. Bolstered by some extremely harsh writings by their German hero Martin Luther, the Nazis reformulated biblical teachings to serve their racial doctrine. They elected a hand-picked Reich bishop to unify Protestant Churches into a single new confession of \\"German Christians\\" whom they then hoped to exploit. This plan for \\"positive Christianity\\" failed, however, because too many conservative Protestant ministers rejected the core values of Nazism. By 1937, it became clear that the Nazis would not be able to construct a single German, Protestant Church, and relations soured. Hitler's position in all this is somewhat ambiguous. His few clear anti-Christian statements relate to specifically Catholic doctrine, not to Christianity more generally. One is left with the impression that Hitler fully rejected the teachings of the Catholic faith into which he had been baptized as a child, but that he never truly rejected his own warped view of Protestant Christianity. An extremely valuable contribution. THis is a First Things reviews a child, but that he never truly rejected his own warped view of Protestant Christianity. An extremely valuable contribution.

The book description already given covers the bases, but it should be noted that this is not useful for someone who is neither a polyglot nor an advanced reader in this area of study.<br />Other useful books in this regard are Cragg's \\"Muhammad and the Christian\\", \\"Paths to the Heart\\" edited by Cutsinger is very useful if you have an interest in Sufism and Eastern Orthodoxy, Bell's \\"The Origin of Islam in Its Christian Environment\\", Daniel Sahas' \\"John of Damascus on Islam: The Heresy of the Ishmaelites\\", and Stockle's \\"The Doctrine of Islam and Christian Belief\\".<br />I also enjoyed \\"The Prophet and the Messiah: An Arab Christian's Perspective in Islam and Christianity\\" by Chawkat Moucarry.<br />One little observation is that many books of this sort approach Islam from the Protestant theological tradition. In many ways this seems to be useful since the majority of Protestants and all true Muslims hold a \\"Quranic\\" notion of the Book. That is, it is literal and intact as given. In Christian terms, this means that functionally most Protestants have zero conception of how the New Testament was formed from the liturgical heart of the Church, and not vice versa. So in this way the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura (bible alone) has a false bond with Islam on a textual level.

At some point the church needs to say \\"Yes\\" to the laity in regards to some points, especially accountability and availability. At some point, the Church has to say \\"NO\\" to a pop-culture that slides further from the heart of the gospel each year. I would suggest that the situation is not as dire as the author proposes, but I would agree that if the Church wants big numbers, it needs to change. But does the Bride of Christ need to be focused on the numbers or on Christ? I do not mean this in an arrogant way, but only as a plea to for Catholics to ask themselves, \\"Do I belong here? Is this my Church?\\" If they answer \\"no\\" with a mind toward reforming the Church in a liberal direction, my suggestion is that they go down the street to Spongville and see if the grass is greener on the other side and if they want to sacrifice doctrine for good feelings under the sign of the rainbow. Not that such a false dichotomy is true, but I see little sign of common ground in my area. I live near a very \\"progressive\\", some would say heretical, diocese. It is not greener on the other side; unless you want to claim the title of Catholic but at heart are Episcopalian or ELCA. I sympathize with the problem, and this book is useful for everyone with their heart and faith at stake.	2003-10-13

He is highly educated in the filed of Islamic studies and is a well-known spokesman for the educated interaction of the two faiths. From my own limited knowledge of the literature, this has been the most useful of the books on the subject owing to its organization and content. It is not polemical, although Moucarry is clearly a Christian.<br />One little observation is that many books of this sort approach Islam from the Protestant theological tradition. In some ways this seems to be useful since the majority of Protestants and all true Muslims hold a \\"Quranic\\" notion of the Book. That is, it is literal and intact as given. In Christian terms, this means that functionally most Protestants have zero conception of how the New Testament was formed from the liturgical heart of the Church, and not vice versa. So in this way the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura (bible alone) has a false bond with Islam on a textual level. It should be noted, however, that when speaking with Moslems it needs to be remembered that their equivalent to Jesus Christ incarnate of Mary as God is not Muhammad, but the Qur'ân. We have an incarnated God, they have an \\"inscripturated\\" God. There is much to learn from the ancient Churches of the Near and Middle East in this regard.<br />Other useful books in this regard are Cragg's \\"Muhammad and the Christian\\", \\"Paths to the Heart\\" edited by Cutsinger is very useful if you have an interest in Sufism and Eastern Orthodoxy, Bell's \\"The Origin of Islam in Its Christian Environment\\", Daniel Sahas' \\"John of Damascus on Islam: The Heresy of the Ishmaelites\\", and Stockle's \\"The Doctrine of Islam and Christian Belief\\".	2003-10-13

We cannot avoid reassessing the fundamental definitions of human life and human society. Is it true that man is above everything?

While ecclesiology as such is not strictly speaking a subject of dogma, since The Father Son and Spirit are the center, it is useful in an age when there is such misunderstanding and confusion about ecclesiology on the part of many Protestants, Roman Catholics and Orthodox.<br />Zizioulas, one of the world's leading ecclesiologists, demonstrates that the notion of Church centers around the interrelationship of Eucharist, Bishop, and Laity. Not positing authority in the power of the bishop, nor even in the people, but in the place of Christ's presence- the bread and wine as partaken of by the people of God. The total Christ, Head and Body, is manifested in the eucharistic celebration, given catholicity a qualitative and not a quantitative meaning.  This raises the question, \\"does the Eucharist make the Church or vice versa?\\" It seems that Zizioulas would say both, but with the particular emphasis upon the former. Church qua Church only dangles off the mouth of the Father. It is always done unto, to use the phrase of Fr. Tarazi (which is why it is not its own object of study). But the context for this dangling is, according to Zizioulas, most manifest in the liturgy. So ultimately the notions of bishop, laity, eucharist are all interdependent. None exist without the other and they are continually in reference to one another.<br />Eucharistic ecclesiology has weaknesses when the attempt is made to make it cover too many bases, but it does seem to be the primal orientation of the early centuries and has received a wide resurgence in both East and West under such notables as Zizioulas, Afanasief, Meyendorff, de Lubac...<br />Other books of interest would include Zizioulas' masterpiece, \\"Being as Communion\\", which is, in my view, one of the best books to be read about any sphere of theology, \\"The Eucharist Makes the Church\\" by McPartlan (a comparison of Zizioulas and Henri de Lubac), \\"For the Life of the World\\" by Schmemann, and Werner Elert's classic study \\"Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the First Four Centuries\\".

The author is totally hyped up by the media who love nothing more than to pick on Catholics, the last group for whom it is still politically correct to hate. The whole thing about the cover photo is just one simple example of the twisting of the historical record, as if a 1927 photo, doctored up and blurred at specific points, is either honest scholarship or relevant!<br />As for Cornwell's statement that he began his book believing it would exonerate the Pope...another piece of nonsense. Does he think that we never read his commentaries on other Catholic issues? As for his \\"highly detailed\\" study in the Vatican archives, a few short hours on a few days doesn't cut mustard.<br />Readers would do much better to spend their time reading \\"Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust\\" by Sanchez, which is reviewed by Cahners Business Information, Inc. as follows: \\"After the hype associated with John Cornwell's 1999 work Hitler's Pope, this careful, scholarly study of Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust is a refreshing contribution to a debate that continues more than a half century after the end of World War II. Sanchez, a professor of history at St. Louis University, thoughtfully examines the various arguments on both sides of a controversy that will likely never be resolved. In doing so, he presents a dispassionate, thoroughly documented tome that exhibits a high degree of fairness. Sanchez began his research in 1998 to provide a fresh, balanced look at a topic on which most authors have found it necessary to weigh in heavily on one side or the other. He assesses claims ranging from allegations that the late pope was an anti-Semite to the defense that the pontiff did not speak out more forcefully against the Nazi persecution of the Jews because he feared he would make things worse for the victims. Sanchez's conclusions offer nods to both the critics and defenders of Pius XII, but because his summary statement is more gray than black or white, readers looking for the sort of spice dished up by Hitler's Pope will doubtless be left disappointed. Sanchez's treatment is ideal for students of history and anyone truly interested in an objective analysis of a controversial figure.\\"<br />One would do well to read the New York Times' coverage of the Pope from the war era to see how both the Jews and the Nazis reacted to this Pope.

While each chapter deals with specific issues, he touches on a great deal of relevant points, which makes the read both enlightening and fun.  His style is easy to follow, which is something that I cannot always say of the preeminent historian of dogma, Jaroslav Pelikan, who heartily indorses this book. You really won't go wrong with this one. Every page has a distilled quality that comes from teaching and living in the minds of the Fathers for several decades.<br /><br />The contents are as follows:<br /><br />1. Founded on the Cross of Christ  2. An Awesome and Unbloody Sacrifice<br /> 3. The Face of God for Now  4. Seek His Face Always  5. Not My Will But Thine 6. The End Given in the Beginning  7. The Reasonableness of the Faith  8. Happy the People Whose God is the Lord  9. The Glorious Deeds of Christ  10. Making This Thing Other  11. Likeness to God  12. The Knowledge of Sensible Things<br /><br />He writes: \\"The intellectual tradition that began in the early Church was enriched by the philosophical breadth and exactitude of medieval thought. Each period in Christian history makes its own unique contribution to Christian life. The Church Fathers, however, set in place a foundation that has proven to be irreplaceable. Their writings are more than a stage in the development of Christian thought or an interesting chapter in the history of the interpretation of the Bible. Like an inexhaustible spring, faithful and true, they irrigate the Christian imagination with life-giving water flowing from the biblical and spiritual sources of the faith. They are still our teachers today.\\"<br /><br />In terms of errors or just overstatements, there are few worth noting, none of which deserve to take away from the book's great worth. Even so,  he refers to Christ as having a divine and human nature, whereas it should read \\"natures\\" in the plural. We are Chalcedonian Christians, after all. And speaking of the Council of Chalcedon, Wilken seems to think that the Fathers we too vague in that instance. Here I would think that in a way he misses the point of the Council's affirmation, or rather, `affirmation of negation'. The Fathers were respecting the inherent mystery of the person of Christ and did so in words by remaining apophatic in their teaching by stating, \\"these things are untrue, of the rest, remain silent\\". It is a true understanding of that mystery that motivated this approach. It could go too far and lead to heresy to do otherwise. For Wilken this is a lack of clarity, for me, an example of wisdom in the face of the living God's presence. Moreover, a passing remark that Augustine is the premier Father leaves me as an Orthodox a little quizzical.<br /><br />You would also enjoy Wilken's \\"[[ASIN:0802808808 Remembering the Christian Past]]\\" and the works of Georges Florovsky. On the question of the Hellenization of the gospel, a la Harnak, which Wilken (and nearly all modern scholars) rejects thoroughly, see also Florovsky and Martin Hengel's works. Hurtado's [[ASIN:0802831672 Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity]] is worth buying and having near the desk.<br /><br />Another up and coming patristic scholar from whom we will be reading and hearing much more in the coming years, God willing, is John Behr, professor of Patristics at St. Vladimir's. His new book, \\"The Way to Nicea\\" is a very helpful guide on the pre-Nicene Christiological tradition and would make a great companion to Wilken's book.<br /><br />Enjoy!nk that the Fathers we too vague in that instance.

They clearly outline the deficiencies of the cornerstone of Protestantism in a spirit of love, humor and charity. He understands that, for Protestants, to question the \\"bible only\\" mentality is tantamount to questioning the whole of salvation history and the very incarnation and resurrection. It may have been Cardinal Ratzinger who said that for Catholics to believe in Christ and to believe in the Church it is one act of faith, whereas for Protestants it is solidly two acts. The function of the Church for Catholics is the role that the scriptures play for Protestants. The main problem, however, is that the latter cannot replace the former and still be the latter. That is, when the scriptures are torn from the heart of the Church, they cease, in some sense, from being the scriptures. It is like saying you believe in Jesus, but then go on to profess a belief that is akin to a Mormon. There are many false christs to believe in, but only one is the Saviour. There are many false ways to understand the scriptures, as the apostles themselves proclaim, as the existence of the thousands of different Protestant denominations, each 'preaching the gospel rightly in the fullness of truth,' is living, contradictory proof. Sola scriptura is in fact a very close cousin to the Muslim, Quranic notion of scripture, but this is too shocking for most Protestants to accept. Jesus is not incarnate in the book, but in the womb of the Virgin.<br />As a former staunch (Lutheran) Protestant, it took a long time for me to digest the fact that the whole notion of sola scriptura was, in fact, based upon an overreaction to Roman Catholic faults, influenced strongly by the \\"return to the sources\\" movement at the time, based upon some of Luther's own personality quirks, and the result of an over-simplistic understanding of God, the Church, and the historical process of the Tradition. But, as Newman said, he who reads the Father's (or Church history) ceases to be Protestant. It went something like that for him, and for me as well!<br />I would also suggest: Sungenis' \\"Not By Scripture Alone\\", which is in many ways the most complete debunking of the myth available.

But what you may not know is the fascinating history behind the creed. Whole empires were torn apart in its development over \\"one iota\\" about who Christ is, lone theologians fought \\"contra mundi\\" for the truth, and political intrigue weighed heavy upon bishops and kings. After Nicea II, several other ecumenical councils were required to delineate the ground upon which theology could be built in reaction to the various challenges both philosophical and cultural that were presented to the faith's expression. Serving as a floor rather than a limiting ceiling, the creeds and the dogmas serve the Church as a sort of map by which we may travel in our faith without getting too lost in the byways of bizarre speculation or individualism.<br /> Before I actually looked at the book, I thought that it would either be a slim volume of original work, owing to Pelikan's age and seemingly fast publishing schedule, or a large tome of primary sources with his insightful notes adding commentary. Oh how I was wrong on my first count! This book weighs in at a hefty 600+ pages and is chuck full of his elegant and scholarly prose. It is not so intellectually lofty that the novice would be intimidated, but perhaps works such as Kelly's \\"Early Christian Creeds\\" or Leo Davis' \\"The First Seven Ecumenical Councils\\" would serve as good companions. There is always that other fine work, \\"Beginning to Read the Creeds\\".<br />Pelikan is truly the master historian of doctrinal development, and the whole notion of creed is intimately bound to that development. He touches upon the perennial themes concerning the validity of the creeds both then and now, the meaning of an ecumenical council, the notion of tradition as the vivifying role of the Holy Spirit in the Church, and the interrelation between scripture and dogma. Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Protestants of all varieties would do well to sit at the feet of Pelikan and reconsider and reflect upon their own notions of the foundation of the faith- the natures and person of Christ and his Bride. We do not always follow the premises of our faith to their logical and historical conclusions.<br />If you are interested in creeds, you may also enjoy Pelikan's five volume set on the development of doctrine, along with his slim \\"The Vindication of Tradition\\". One author that I continually reference is Georges Florovsky. He had a firm grasp on the primary sources and spirit of early Christianity and served as one of Pelikan's mentors. His, \\"Bible, Church and Tradition\\" is very relevant to the whole notion of doctrinal development and creedal consensus.

That is, we are created to glorify and celebrate. God, the chief object of our glorification, and the very nature and cycle of our existence are the continual subjects of adoration and festive reflection across so many cultures and times. Even when the concept of God is removed from society, there persists the nagging need to commemorate and celebrate the past in terms quite religious. Memorial Day is a real anamnesis, Thanksgiving is eucharistic, etc. Some will disagree with this thesis, but I think it bears consideration.<br />Pieper does something similar in his work by drawing on the ancient and more recent past to analyze the notions of Feast, sacred rest, and joy.

I found Garvey's short book of essays insightful. Some of it is rather dated, being first published in 1986, but the general theme of the work is perennial. The following is from the introduction and is a better summary than I can come up with: \\"What is this book about? It has been said by more than one writer that you write in order to find out what you think, and in going over several years' worth of writing I see a movement toward Orthodox Christianity, coupled with a belief that that orthodoxy has little to do with the certainties which some people demand of religion. This should not lead us to a secular resignation, or to a belief that because we cannot always be certain we must act without clear conviction. Rather, we should see that the need to be right (which is often a part of the quest for certainty) has very little to do with love for the truth. It is rather a way of shoring up the ego, even a way of protecting ourselves from the message of Christianity, which involves a transformation more thorough than many of us would like, at least at the level of consciousness to which we are most accustomed.  True spirituality involves an awakening, a sharpening of awareness, and this goes against the grain of our culture, which seems to be built on distraction and violence. The forms of liturgy and spirituality which we need will in that sense be counter-cultural and involve a protest- a willingness to be unfashionable and to question the certainties of liberal and conservative Christianity alike.\\"<br />I would recommend Henri Nouwen's \\"Compassion\\", Merton's \\"New Seeds of Contemplation\\" and the true account of one such follower of Christ, \\"Father Arseny\\".	2003-09-23

Depending on your answer, you and I will be forever divided between heaven and earth.\\" This is the heart of Compassion. Nouwen and his co-authors argue that it is only genuine compassion, the ability to go outside of one's self in love for the other, that we find the meaning of God's love in Christ. It speaks directly to the heart of the Gospel, an incarnate faith in a life of compassion. Christ is known in \\"the least of these,\\" in the person who is next to you now, on the bus, in the office, at your home. This is one of the books that I would really like to recommend to any Christian, regardless of their interests in theology or spirituality.<br />Centered around the self-emptying, kenotic love of God in Christ, the book reminds us that Christianity is not a dogma, or a rule, or some system, but rather a Person. The authors use St. Paul's letter to the Philippians, 2:6-11, as the scriptural touchstone of the book. \\"In your minds you must be the same as Christ Jesus...\\" Dogmas and theologies are footnotes, Nouwen suggests, to the reality of the crucified and risen Christ as experienced by the disciples and his followers. They are essential, but they are not the \\"thing\\" in itself. To come to know the meaning of our lives, our creation, we must enter into the love of God directly through compassion.<br />Anyone in the field of social services would benefit from this book immensely. Sometimes we loose sight of the value and meaning of our lives. This book is an antidote.<br />This insightful work is divided into three parts. 1) The Compassionate God- examining the nature and mission of Christ and what he tells us about the Father. 2) The Compassionate Life- the roles and meaning behind community, displacement and togetherness. 3) The Compassionate Way- Patience, Prayer and Action.<br />Each chapter stands alone and can be profitably used in group studies or for personal reflection.<br />One of my favorite books!

His thoughts are balanced, very informed, and full of insights that weigh the best of past and present scholarship. Combined with an almost freaky familiarity with the primary sources, Meyendorff is top-notch.<br />This book is a collection of eleven essays on themes that all relate to Eastern Orthodoxy in its Byzantine form. Divided into five parts, topics include 1) They Byzantine Church 2) Church and State relations 3) Church and Culture 4) Theology 5) Authority and Structure in the Church.<br />Parts four and five were of special interest for this reader, finding much to digest from chapter 7 on the Holy Spirit, as God. Each essay stands alone, but reading them together gives a strong flavor of the themes that ran through the culture and Church.<br />Meyendorff's masterpiece, \\"Byzantine Theology\\" is strongly recommended for beginner and expert.

The authors, all well respected scholars of international standing, take issue with the current trend in many seminaries and universities of approaching the scriptures from the starting point that they cannot possibly be true in any real way. This is why the previous review misses the point. The authors are not against using their brains or modern scholarship, but they ask, \\"What exactly is scholarship?\\" I would ask the reviewer if he has ever actually read what Spong or the Jesus Seminar put out. If that is honest scholarship, then the academic community is serious trouble.<br />Donfried's essay, along with the others, takes issue with the politicization of scriptural interpretation. Is it honest scholarship to have an agenda that clearly is not based upon the text and then to read the bias into the meaning of the text only to act surprised that, in fact, the scriptures claim Jesus was just a pale Galilean who, had he lived just a bit more, would have seen things differently? It is actually more of an act of faith to do so than to take the gospels as they have been taken throughout the ages since it requires the \\"scholar\\" to go against every notion of both common sense and acceptable exegetical methods. So much for intellectual honesty and rigor!<br />A note about orthodox Christian scholarship being \\"self-reproducing\\": The authors of this book take issue with the current trend, for over 20 years now, of publish or perish. That is, unless an author comes up with some very odd or controversial thesis, the paper or book will not get published and the university will start asking them, \\"So, where's the papers and books you need to write to keep us happy?\\" Ask any professor in the humanities. The temptation to write wacky articles with only shreds of documentation is very powerful. This is especially true in the religious studies departments. Unfortunately, scandal and controversy sell while orthodoxy comes across as boring \\"self-reproduction\\". It would be funny to imagine a conversation between those who say that orthodoxy is unoriginal and the early Christians who were up against the philosophical and religious trends of their time with the idea that God could actually become incarnate and die! Unoriginal? Hardly.<br />On a lighter note, Aidan Kavanagh's essay on the relationship between scriptural interpretation and worship is very needed and useful. Following the maxim `The rule of prayer is the rule of faith,\\" he argues that \\"if the Bible needs reclaiming in the church...it must follow that the Church's worship must be reclaimed as well. To push the thesis further I suggest that liturgical dysfunction may well be a major reason for biblical dysfunction in the church\\" (132).<br />The general theme of this book, so odd and unintellectual to some, is that the Bible is actually properly understood in the context of the Church, for whom it was written. Is this so wrong? Last time I checked, St. Paul didn't write his letters to a draft committee before sending them off to Thessalonica or Philippi.<br />To get a good feel for the motives and Psudo-scholarship involved in the Jesus Seminar, read Johnson's \\"The Real Jesus\\". N. T. Wright has tons of good corrective material in this regard as well. For Spong enthusiasts, I suggest a reading of \\"Can A Bishop Be Wrong?\\".he current trend, for over 20 years now, of publish or perish.

Using the RSV and the New Vulgate (Latin), with tons of very insightful and scholarly footnotes, the series introduces the reader to the world of Christ and the Apostles through the eyes of the Catholic Church. Drawing upon modern and ancient scholarship, the reader is able to enter into the text in a devotional and intellectual manner. The footnotes, which take up most of the page, shed light and raise new questions for further inquiry and prayer.<br />While not THE Catholic study edition, it is clearly setting the benchmark high for future publications.  My only criticism, and it isn't really a fair one, is that I wish the notes would have made more extensive use of more Church Fathers- especially Eastern Fathers. But since it is the Roman Church, it makes sense that Sts. Augustine and Aquinas should loom so large.  Nonetheless, it is a fantastic resource and is highly recommended!<br />For those of you, like myself, who are not Roman Catholic- \\"Don't be put off!\\" Look at some sample pages and see for yourself. This is top-notch creedal Christian scholarship.<br /><br />If you have a particular interest in St. John's gospel , then you may be interested in reading John Sanford's \\"Mystical Christianity\\".

They give a better overview of the book than I can attempt here. However, I learned a great deal about the influences of various iconographers and the religious reasons behind their various approaches to writing icons. While not a devotional book per se, it does contain a great deal of hagiographical information that an Orthodox would find beneficial.<br />Some insights that I learned in the reading:<br />In chapter three there is a discussion on the question of naming the saint in the icon and the need for proper, accurate representation. The author contends that after the iconoclastic period, the theology of the icon shifted to take the \\"power\\" or agency away from the image itself, the actual physical piece of wood and paint, to the one who is represented. This meant that the images had to be labeled with the saint's name to enable the viewer to communicate with the saint behind the image. I would argue that while this is true, it is not entirely true. Speaking as an Orthodox Christian, too much can be made of the label. The oil that weeps from icons heals even the atheists of diseases, without faith on their part. Likewise, speaking theologically, the basis of Christian iconography is the dual natures of Christ- fully human and fully God. Christ's universal power in the particular saints operates accordingly. The universal is given even if the particular is not understood or, perhaps, willingly approached. To a non-Christian, or even a non-Orthodox, this statement may sound ridiculous. But then again, the icons are not meant to be in museums, but rather in the homes and churches of the faithful. Icons in museums, unvenerated and without their candles, are truly fish out of water. Henry Maguire, I would say, supports this understanding in this book. On a more kitsch level, it is akin to the World Market approach to selling little Buddhas to be placed on the floor in fancy homes.<br />I chapter four there is an interesting analysis of the use of detail in painting with the curious observation that \\"the less the important the imagery, the richer it could be in detail, and conversely, the higher its status, the more it should be deficient\\" (166).<br />This book reaffirms that while secular art has its own philosophy, Orthodox iconography must be approached from its own unique perspective.<br />Another highly recommended work on Iconography is the beautifully bound and illustrated \\"The Resurrection and the Icon\\" by Quenot. Very well done!resting analysis of the use of detail in painting with the curious observation that \\"the less the important the imagery, the richer it could be in detail, and conversely, the higher its status, the more it should be deficient\\" (166).<br />This book reaffirms that while secular art has its own philosophy, Orthodox iconography must be approached from its own unique perspective.<br />Another highly recommended work on Iconography is the beautifully bound and illustrated \\"The Resurrection and the Icon\\" by Quenot.

Lewis and the Case Against Scientism	Books	5	32	33	N	Y	Great intro to Lewis and the Philosophy of Science	This is a really first rate book for a number of reasons. First, those who have an interest in the relationship between science, religion, and reason since the 17th century will be captivated by the intelligent assimilation of many of the leading philosophers of science and ethics, along with a slew of theologians, giving the whole tenor of the book a flavor of insight and wisdom. Secondly, readers with an interest in C. S. Lewis will find this slim book the perfect introduction to his approach to the question of knowledge, conscience, and science- dovetailing with his classic, The Abolition of Man. A third reason why this book is so useful is that it is written in a manner that is clear enough for the novice, but insightful enough to give the more advanced thinker something to chew on. In fact, it is chuck full of insight that I felt as if I read a much longer work when I was finished. A final reason; the importance of the subject matter is such that it merits to be studied and considered by anyone who tries to think and act upon their religious-philosophical beliefs. So many non-Christians reject not Christianity, but a weird version of it that they either concocted in their heads or saw on the television. Real Christianity is something much more different than the wishy-washy Zwinglian brand that is sold today to the masses- a faith that is robust, the actual foundation of scientific inquiry, and capable of meeting the challenges of a secular society head on with sanctity, intellectual rigor, and compassion. That is the heart of this fantastic book.<br />A real wreking ball to scientific materialism.	2003-09-17

Moreover, not everything that they wrote is automatically, according to Florovsky, Tradition. Ultimately, the Church as a eucharistic worshiping community, that is, Church qua Church, is the criterion of the Tradition. This is owing to the fact that the Church is not an abstract proposition, not a vague mystical communion without boundaries, but this or that specific group of people together in Christ.<br />This and other themes are covered in chapters that include \\"The Lost Scriptural Mind\\", \\"The Catholicity of the Church\\" \\"The Function of Tradition the Ancient Church\\" \\"The Authority of the Councils and the Tradition of the Fathers\\" plus several more.<br />The works of Fr John Meyendorff are also very insightful in this regard.

Patrick argues persuasively that the Pslams are the backbone to a proper understanding of the human condition, the heart of God, and the nature of Christ's incarnation. Following the traditional exegetical method of understanding the Old Testament in light of the resurrection, Fr. Patrick illuminates the psalter in a manner both academic and devotional. Apart of Lewis's book on the psalms, there is really not much else out there of this quality in both regards.<br />No previous knowledge of Greek or Hebrew is needed. It is not an intimidating read at all and it is the type of book that you will want to read over and over through the seasons. Very highly recommended!	2003-09-13

Books	5	13	16	N	N	debunking the debunkers	Wright, one of the world's leading biblical scholars, takes a close look at the writings of three popular debunkers of the Gospel image of Christ. The works of Barbara Thiering, A.N. Wilson, and Shelby Spong (Mr. I-am-a-bishop-who-believes-nothing-of-the-Gospel) are reviewed through the lenses of logic and scholarship, with results that should give the Jesus Seminar folks (or at least their readers) pause to think if whether or not the whole enterprise is anything more than a publicity stunt geared at eliminating traditional Christian morality by undercutting its founder, Jesus Christ.<br />The other reviewers have said what needs to be mentioned, but I will just add that this little book is a fantastic introduction to the both sides of the argument. Anyone familiar with Wright's style will at once agree that he is a very fair author when he deals with those who hold views other than his own. Even so, he is also a rather humorous writer and I have found myself laughing aloud when he exposes the idiocy of someone like Thiering who claims, with absolute seriousness and zero textual support even from other scholars, that Jesus was married and had a few kids. Is that what St Luke meant when he said that the Word grew? Uh, I think not. It was like the man who claimed that had Jesus lived just a bit longer his whole view on the God issue would have matured. Nonsense in the guise of reason.<br />You may also want to check out Wright's other books. The thiker volumes are detailed and quite thik to read, but still worth the effort. In connection to the question of the reliability of the Gospels, his work on St Paul is valuable and clear. Luke Timothy Johnson's &quot;The real Jesus&quot; is also a very fun read about the farce known as the Jesus Seminar.<br />Read it all for yourself and you will see that the search for the historical Jesus is little more than a money-making industry set out to come up with new and exciting theories about the REAL and TRUE history of the Church with the ultimate end in mind of changing the ethics of the culture without the guilt (Spong's apparent raison d'etre).rch with the ultimate end in mind of changing the ethics of the culture without the guilt (Spong's apparent raison d'etre).	2003-09-08

Charles Bridge in Prague is a favorite, as is Westminster Abbey in London. Places of importance for so many saints and sinners and in between. The value of this little book about Lewis is, to people like myself, obvious. Our connection through the page needs to be extended to the place. Lewis, whose writings have inspired our lives with magic and devotion, has also taught many of us the value of the particular. Through the particular we come to the universal. \\"There are no trees, only this Elm.\\" Put another way, he teaches us the value of place and physicality.<br /><br />For those American readers who have been to England it is clear that the island is the landscape of dragons and queens. Each page of this book is filled with those little details that tease us a little more and draw us closer. Filled with photos and maps, it contains VERY detailed descriptions of Lewis' old haunts, along with clear maps and suggestions for daytrips or overnighters. Even if you are not planning on going overseas, this book is a really unique addition to your Lewis collection. The size is just right for touring.

One can beleive the right thing for the wrong reason, and in my view, this book is an example of such faulty logic.<br />Starting her thesis with a very useful analysis of Simone de Beauvoir's role as a protofeminist, she uses her life as a stepping stone into the issue of God, gender, and the Church.<br />Tracing, what is in her opinion, scriptural support for the oppression of women, she goes on to show that modern scholarship has discovered that lo and behold, Genesis does not teach that women are subordinated to men in worth and function! Uh, is that really a modern understanding or did some Church fathers say the same thing? I would argue that it was in many respects Augustine who is the bearer of much of the Western church's understanding of Genesis and that inthe East, it was the influence of various gnosticisms that downgraded the value of women and their bodies- not at all representative of the whole tradition.<br />And when she speaks of St. paul, she has many cogent remarks that are quite true. Paul wrote to specific communities about specific issues. For us to generalize from this may be problematic, she write. True. However, the manner of her exegesis makes Paul a master of isogesis! For example, Paul in Corinthians 11:7ff makes a few outlandish statements and then, realizing that it was a dumb thing to write, &quot;immediately&quot; corrected himself in the following verse. This is silly. It may be true that that Paul is wrong about his interpritation of Gensis, and I doubt that he is, but it is stupid to say that Paul would write something (or dictate it) and then say to himself, whoops that was dumb, I guess I should say this instead. No scholar that I know of, and Daly is no scholar of scripture, teaches this as an acceptable exegetical method.<br />And then there is my favorite anti-female text in St. Paul that Daly latches onto in typical fashion. Of course it is not anti-woman in the least, but Daly does what is so predictable. She quotes the first section of Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 and fails to read on in the sentence immediately following when it says that husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the Church and died for Her. If I am not mistaken, this injuction of mutual submission placed upon the man a crown not of gold but of thornes, or, as Lewis would say, of paper, while at the same time raising up the status of women (and marriage in general) by placing them within the context of the role of Christ and His own Bride.<br />Her criticism of the patristic period is needed and welcome, but again, it is not a thorough treatment.<br />Daly's analysis is not all together bad. In fact, I enjoy her writing very much. However, her premise seems to override her scholarship and logic by fitting a few round pegs into a few square holes. Maybe that is too harsh and I should write now, in accordance with her pualine interpritation, that she is right on. Alas, I cannot.<br />For me,the value of this work is found not in its conclusions, but in its questions.<br />I would recommend for those intersted in this issue the works of Manfred Hauke, especially his God or Goddess.

It was a case of being honest about one's position. (I wonder when Spong will make a similar declaration?)<br />The authors of this book, leading experts in debunking the Gospels, have not said anythijng really new in terms of their brand of scholarship, but it is a nice synopsis. In my view, they make the same mistake as the Seminar. They decide ahead of time that the gospels are myth (reactions to guilt on the disciples' part, anti-semitism, etc.) and then look for ways to prove it, rather than holding the possibility open that they may in fact be true.<br />Something that traditional Christian scholars are bad at is making themselves more marketable. Unlike the Seminar folk, they don't use titles like &quot;What Jesus really said&quot; or &quot;Virgin Birth? How Jesus was really Conceived and why the Church is scared of this book&quot;.  Look at the titles of Gerd's books. They are meant to be sensational appeals to all those people who are looking for reasons to mock Christianity. Not that Christians haven't done many stupid things worth mocking, but the whole exercise is just as silly as the fundamentalist, holy rollers who think that you can claim the name and get rich.<br />What this book fails to take into account is the massive amount of scholarship that totally disagrees with their own. The authors present their theories as if they were obvious facts that only a stupid Christian could disagree with. The real fact is that these authors start with conclusions and work a theory, weak theories in fact, and then act as if they proved the theory that they only assumed. Just read the other review to see what I mean. He calls attention to the fact that the authors will say,&quot;Such and such a verse is not really a true word of Jesus but only a later addition to the text...&quot; But that is the whole issue. There are thousands of other very compitent scholars who criticize these very authors for such slips in logic, but they don't sell thousands of books because they are not selling new ideas that will revolutionize the faith. The slip in logic is assuming what one was trying to prove. Of course if the Gospels are made up fiction then the faith is a joke, but that is the question. Are they made up fiction? OIs the whole of Church history founded upon a lie?<br />I would suggest that you read this book along with the works of N. T. Wright.

Being the father of modern theological history, Pelikan won his readers over with a direct, if not often dry, style that nonetheless gave strong opinions. The main thrust of his writing is contained in this little gem of a book, namely, that we have to understand the meaning and value of tradition if we are to understand our present context and our future course of action. And it is with a hope in this tradition of the Church that I wish Dr. Pelikan  rest in the presence of the Fathers and \\"may his memory be eternal,\\" now that his own voice has been added to the democracy of the dead.<br /><br />Chesterton, in his book Orthodoxy, stated that tradtion is the democracy of the dead. Pelikan comes to a similar conclusion when he writes that it is the living faith of the dead. Giving your ancestors a vote is something that modern culture, as well as in academia no less, finds a bit untrustworthy. After all, is not progress, that dogma of the modern era, the antithesis of tradition? Not quite, writes Pelikan. Only within the context of a tradtion that has as its hallmark the ability to both hold the person within its embrace while at the same time pointing beyond itself can true progress be both understood as such and achieved, connected to the past and yet living within the potential of new growth. The modern error, and that of so many of the greatest heresies, is that it fails to maintain a connection with the whole. This is the modern iconoclastic temptation- to break the image of the past in the hopes of inventing it anew. It is destined to fall short.<br /><br />Theologically, for Pelikan, his whole notion of tradition reflects the view of one of his own mentors, Georges Florovsky. For Florovsky, the tradition is nothing less than the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church (see his \\"Bible, Church and Tradition\\"). To rebel against tradition properly understood is akin to reinventing the theological wheel, which is the tendancy in Zwinglian American Protestantism.<br /><br />A fantastic read. You will find it as a key to the underlying stream of thought in all of Pelikan's works.kin to reinventing the theological wheel, which is the tendancy in Zwinglian American Protestantism.

It captures the spirit of a man, so much like us all, who longs for that something beyond the next hill or behind the wistful smile.  How many of us sense intuitively that life is wrapped in a mystery, the veil of separation thin? Hesse's poetry, like his novels, reminds me that even though the inner meaning to life often seems just beyond my reach, it is none the less to be found in the quotidian activities of breathing the fresh air, cutting the finger on the edge of a dish, or listening to Bach as I clean the garage. Written almost 90 years ago, his poetry still rings true to the wandering steppenwolfe in each one of us. \\"The Gate of Heaven is everywhere.\\"<br />You may also be captivated by another moving anthology of poetry, \\"Against Forgetting\\".

Many of the Festschrift that I pick up are useful for one or two articles, with the remainder dealing with topics too broad for my rather narrow interest in tradition and the development of dogma. Rowan Williams, however, has done a masterful job in editing this collection of essays in honor of Henry Chadwick by narrowing the collection to a very specific timeframe and subject matter. Of course, this is in part owing to Chadwick's interest as a scholar. There are 16 essays and all of them are by really top-notch scholars in the field of early Christianity. I especially enjoyed reading Williams' essay, \\"Does it make sense to speak of pre-Nicene orthodox?\\" and Richard Hanson's, \\"The achievement of orthodoxy in the fourth century\\", each dealing with the various controversies and offering sympathetic defenses of the various schools of thought, nuancing away from more traditional, \\"Arius Evil Athanasius Good\\" accounts, showing clearly that the heretics were neither illogical, or impious. Rather, for the most part, they were trying to articulate their own views by drawing upon various aspects of the common tradition; their mistakes often the result of a too literalistic, one-sided adherence to one part of that very tradition. In a sense the major heretics are the equivalent of our modern day fundamentalists I that they hold on too tightly to one aspect of the truth, strangling the life out it, inducing a theological rigamortis (sp?), and then left holding a rigid system that does not resemble the malleable truth of the whole tradition.<br />All of the essays are coherent and insightful. Really worth the read! My only sorrow is that Jaroslav Pelikan doesn't have an essay in the book. He must have been too busy writing for one of the two-dozen or so collections that he was involved with at the time!<br />Enjoy!	2003-08-13

While the author is a Lutheran, he has a deep appreciation of this most beloved Eastern Orthodox saint and theologian, presenting Maximus' ideas clearly, sympathetically, and in a VERY detailed manner.<br />It is silly for the other reviewer to discount the work because it has no large paortions of Maximus' work translated. It doesn't advertise itself as such and, to answer his other objection, those works are available in English and other modern languages by authors such as Andrew Louth.<br />One shouldn't be upset if it is scholarly. It is of no use to approach a figure as complicated as Maximus and expect simple reading. I should say that the other reviewer would be more confused by reading the translations of Maximus than by Thunberg's analysis!<br />THis is a really good book with lots of great info, making it the milemarker for studies on Maximus.

Obviously there is an element of this at Nicea, but to claim, among other things, that Christians were not already and from the beginning worshipping and celebrating the Eucharist on Sunday and that it took the emperor to settle it is a stretch. Argue if you want, but at least read a few other books that are not so biased. If you think that the Church became something radically different after Nicea, you have some learning to do. The Orthodox tradition only makes sense, however, if you believe that some theological opinions are more faithful to the apostolic tradition than others. In other words, \\"rainbow theology\\" is not how the early Church functioned. If she did, then the Lord's apostles were in extreme delusion, for they too discerned light from darkness in aspects that were not strictly moral (i.e. gnostic trends, although many false teachings lead to immorality).<br /><br />I recommend Davis' [[ASIN:0814656161 The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)] and [[ASIN:0819215139 The Cruelty of Heresy: An Affirmation of Christian Orthodoxy]] to start with (and no, they are not \\"let's dump on the heretics\\" sort of books).

For those people who read this book to prove that Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy are just the result of political intrigue, but that their Protestant traditions are not, let me say this: This book is not for you. Why? Becasue the very thesis that underlies this book would undercut your own traditions from the Reformation era of Calvin, Luther and Zwingli. Just because there were political pressures placed upon the Fathers of the council proves nothing either way about the legitimacy of the council's outcome. THis is just plain history, and a Protestant must also beleive this when reading the lives of the Reformers. They may have been right or wrong, but not just because they used or were used by the rulers of their times. OF course it may be the case, but God Himself uses the rulers of the world for His own will, does he not? It shouldn't surprise us that if He can speak out of Barlaam's donkey he can use Constantine to do His will even if Constantine's own motives were in part political (which no Christian scholars would deny, e.g. Jaroslav Pelikan and Wilken).<br /><br />Furthermore, I would say to those who are reading this book to disprove Christianity in general that they should look elsewhere. THis book is historically weak in its scholarship (and its outdated thesis, although in our academic climate of publish or perish it has to reappear for the shock value of its thesis and suppossed outcomes).<br /><br />Most \\"debunkers\\" of Christianity  have long since discarded the attempt to disprove the Faith by criticizing the sources. They typically resort to saying that the early church wasjust wrong in its assumption about who Jesus of Nazareth was. Read the Jesus Seminar folks for this view, or the popular heretical \\"bishop\\" of the hertical Episcopal communion, Shelby Spong.<br /><br />About nonbiased scholarship in this book: There is no such thing.

His analysis of De Lubac is useful.<br />The issue is so pertinent to our understanding of what the Church is in its essence. Is it fundamentally Protestant ecclessiologically or Roman? Perhaps it is neither. What I appreciate about this book is that it underscores the fact that whatever ecclessiology one is influenced by, the centrality of the Eucharist must be maintained. I personally would argue that the Eucharist makes the CHurch and that the Church makes the Eucharist since Jesus Christ is the Eucharist and the CHurch is His body. The implications of this ecclessiology form what is best, in my opinion, in the Eastern Orthodox tradition (not that the Orthodox have any declared dogma about the Church beyond it being &quot;One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic&quot;). Such a definition also seems to my mind to find support in the canons of the ealry councils and can serve as a source of contact between those traditions that take Christ's presence in the bread and wine seriously.<br />I would recommend reading a few other books before this one.<br />&quot;Being as Communion&quot; by Zizioulas is a penetrating analysis of what communion means in the New testament, the Church Fathers, and the philosophical mileu of the early Church.

Thus he is a modern embodiment of the scholar/warrior that is held as the ideal in both Western and Asian cultures.<br /><br />Concerning the text of his book, it is endorsed by a virtual \\"who's who\\" of Gojo-ryu. He covers in great detail, in an engaging style, the various aspects of martial arts on Okinawa and the surrounding islands, including the Chinese influence.  After this general background, he goes into much detail with the history of Gojo-ryu's masters and influences, starting with Kanryo Higaonna and working his way to modern times. Some great photos add to Higaonna's gift of story-telling, including one that has in it, unlabelled, Shinpan Gusukuma of Shorin-ryu notoriety. This is worth noting since photos of him are uncommon (of course excluding a book of kata and kumite).<br /><br />Overall, why this book demands to be read by serious karate historians is that the author conducted dozens of interviews over a thirty year period of people who had first hand knowledge of events that have otherwise failed to be printed in languages other than Japanese. Moreover, the author's own expertise in the Naha-style of karate gives him intimate knowledge of the subject matter from a technical aspect.<br /><br />What I am left with after reading it for a second time, and this time during one sitting, is that Okinawan karate is very much related to the perfection of character, more so than is commonly discussed in dojo around the U.S. Almost all of the masters in this story are obsessed with right living. That means something, and more to me personally as I grow older.<br /><br />I would recommend Mark Bishop's [[ASIN:0804832056 Okinawan Karate: Teachers, Styles and Secret Techniques]]as a detailed, readable and usually accurate account of the major and minor traditions of Okinawan combat arts. Of course it is not entirely correct, but who can get that story right, especially a non-Okinawan? Gambatte!<br /><br />Enjoy!he major and minor traditions of Okinawan combat arts.

US	34236000	REPR9G2QPPHC6	0385500912	463676104	The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality	Books	5	127	130	N	Y	Authentic Wisdom	Having read Markides' account of his contact with the monks of Mount Athos, and being quite familiar with the literature on the subject of Eastern Christian mysticism/theology, I have to say that this book was a real means of grace for me. To further make my point, one needs only to read who recommends the book on the back cover- Bishop Kallistos Ware, the preeminent spokesman for Eastern Orthodoxy in the West and the retired professor of Eastern Orthodox studies at Oxford University!<br />I can positively remark that this book accurately depicts the practical outcome of anyone who follows the guidance of the Christian East. Holiness and wisdom are not reserved only for the monks, but for all those who seek Christ with a pure heart. The wisdom of Father Maximos, a main figure in the book, is simply a distillation of the wisdom of 2000 years of prayer and worship as found in the East. If it happens to reflect in some ways current New Age mentalities, it is not, believe me, a sign that the Eastern Church has somehow taken their advice! I have the suspicion that those who understand Christianity through Western Protestant eyes would find this work a bit odd to say the least. Monks who are clairvoyant, can change someone else's perception of time, etc are not common in Protestant Christianity. But then again, they have not had the benefit of a 2000-year-old tradition of spirituality and prayer. This is not to put the Protestants down, it is only the observation that there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the East already has a very succinct and proven method of spiritual development that goes much beyond the non-accountable, individualistic spirit of much of the Christian West.<br />IF you have an interest in the underpinnings of the Eastern approach to Jesus Christ and the Trinity and the Church etc, then you would do well to read &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; by Kallistos Ware, or, if you want to dig into some deeper theology, &quot;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot; by Vladimir Lossky is a classic, as is the difficult but rewarding masterpiece &quot;Being As Communion&quot; by Zizioulas.

If you have any interest in what the art of ninjutsu is about, this book will give you keen insights and serve as a great teaser to find out if one of hatsumi's students os teaching near you.<br />One of the catchy characteristics of this book is that is is for the most part the transcript of a meeting that Hayes and his wife had with Hatsumi over 12 years ago, back in 1986. Its new conclusion is a modern transcript of a meeting that the three had a year ago.<br />You will especially enjoy this book if you have trained with Hatsumi or his more skilled students.

This short introduction covers the main themes of his own life- origins, education, cultural context, etc, along with a nice assortment and analysis of his own writings. This book is well-written and is broken down into short chapters for easy study. The author is a Belgian Jesuit and professor at the University of Antwerp who specializes in the spirituality of the Middle Ages.<br />From the conclusion: &quot;Ruusbroec did not appear in the Low Countries like a solitary meteorite in a sky without stars. rather, he is the brightest star in a constellation of spiritual writers...The culture of the inner life, the spiritual experience of the Eucharist, the meditation on teh Word made man, the three stages of the spiritual life, the negative knowledge of God; all of these themes are common to the spiritual authors of the Mddle ages. Ruusbroec treated them in a very personal way and brought them together in an original synthesis.&quot;<br />You may also enjoy reading &quot;The Common Life: The Origins of Trinitarian Mysticism and Its Development by Jan Ruusbroec&quot; by the popular author and scholar Louis Dupre.

I will quote from the jacket:<br />\\"The Jewish ancestry of Christianity is not merely a matter of religious sentiment but the object of scholarly research. One of the aims of this series is to analyse how Jewish cultural elements were assimilated by and adopted to the needs of the arising new religion. The present volume contains two seperate studies. Schrekenberg shows how successive Christian authors turned Josephus's description of the fall of Jerusalem into a confirmation of Christian superiority. Next he demonstartes how this view of the Jewish historian and his works appears in medieval Christian illustrations. In another contribution, Schubert discusses the existence of a Jewish pictoral tradition and its influence on early Christian art. Such influence was all the more likely where Christian artists were unaware of potential conflicts of the Jewish iconography with Christian doctrine. This volume is richly illustrated with reproductions of the pertinent works of art.\\"<br />You may also enjoy \\"The Resurrection and the Icon\\" by Quenot.	2003-07-20

What are we to call the God of Jews and Christians? This collection of essays does an excellent job in providing thoughtful, argumentative, and logical arguments in favor of traditional \\"God Talk\\". Even though it is not in favor of saying, \\"Glory to the Parent, Child and Spirit\\", it does not dismiss those who believe such in a flippant or disrespectful manner. Taking their cue from the modern controversy in literature and lecture, the contributors of this volume leave the reader with much to think about. I would also guess that most readers, regardless of their position on the matter, will be forced to rethink their own ideas of God by reexamining their own assumptions or prejudices.<br />Here are a few quotes:<br />\\"Thus our knowing of God rests not on a center in ourselves but on a center in God, not on the ground of our own being, but on the ground of God's being. Our ability to know him is grounded not in some capacity of our own but in the activity of God in opening himself to our knowing and actually making himself known to us through his Word.\\"<br />&quot;By contemplating, participating in, and imitating the saving activity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the oikonomia of creation, salvation, and deification, human persons can discover what it means for them to be men and women, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters in the image and likeness of God the Father revealed through Christ the Son in the Holy Spirit, who makes creation to be God's bride, the wife of the Lamb, and whose presence in the church is already the anticipatory pledge . . . of the &quot;Jerusalem above&quot; which is &quot;free&quot; and is &quot;our mother&quot; (Gal. 4:26).&quot;<br />&quot;Just as God is the first teacher of Trinitarian truth, so also is it God who provides the first lesson in Trinitarian grammar: &quot;When we cry 'Abba!

I enjoyed very much his weaving together of his own personal spiritual journey with that of his forbearers.<br />While the other reviewer thought that his description of Lutheranism was off base (I agree), I would remark that the Universalist or Puritan trajectory of the Reformation was not an illogical outcome given some of the premises of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli concerning the nature of revelation, the church, the bible, matter, redemption, damnation and self. They are certainly not the only possible outcomes, which the author sort of implies, but they are certainly connected intellectually to Luther.<br />If you want to know more than you want to know about the relationships of the Naturalist Emerson and Thoreau, or neat details about Hawthorne and Melville, not to mention countless other luminaries, this book's later chapters will certainly be of interest to you.<br />You may find \\"Surprised By Joy\\" by C.

The book is worth buying just for the introduction, which outlines the meaning of theology in the Orthodox Church. Is Christian theology just neo-Platonism? Is God transcendent just because we are limited in our understanding? Is grace created or uncreated? Is deification (theosis) a Hellenic leftover or the meaning of union in Christ? Why was Christ incarnate and what does the Holy Spirit do? What do we say about how God is in Himself and how God is in relation to creation? Lossky tackles these and other pertinent subjects in this masterpiece. You will not read this book and remain unchanged, not because Lossky is such an original and innovative thinker (he is that), but because Lossky faithfully interprets the Tradition. The rest of this review is taken from the jacket of the book itself.<br /><br />Vladimir Lossky established himself as one of the most brilliant of Orthodox scholars in the years between his departure from Russia in 1923 and his death in 1958. His uncompromising faithfulness to Scriptural and patristic tradition, coupled with his constant concern for an articulate Orthodox witness in the West, make his works indispensable for an understanding of the theology of the Eastern Church today. In this classic study of Orthodox theology, Lossky states that 'in a certain sense all theology is mystical, in as much as it shows forth the divine mystery: the data of revelation...the eastern tradition has never made a sharp distinction between mysticism and theology, between personal experience of the divine mysteries and the dogma affirmed by the Church.' The term 'mystical theology' denotes in the realm of human experience, that which is accessible yet inaccessible; those things understood yet surpassing all knowledge.<br /><br />While it is not an easy read at all, it is well worth the time spent in praying and thinking through the subject from an Eastern perspective.<br />Other books of interest include: [[ASIN:0913836583 The Orthodox Way]], [[ASIN:0823209679 Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes]], [[ASIN:0199291403 The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition: From Plato to Denys]], [[ASIN:0913836435 Orthodox Theology: An Introduction]], [[ASIN:0913836133 In the Image and Likeness of God]], any Georges Florovsky books, [[ASIN:0385500920 The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality]], [[ASIN:0811217248 New Seeds of Contemplation]], [[ASIN:B0067QUNFI An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith - Enhanced]] and [[ASIN:0140146563 The Orthodox Church: New Edition]].<br /><br />Enjoy!is not an easy read at all, it is well worth the time spent in praying and thinking through the subject from an Eastern perspective.<br />Other books of interest include: [[ASIN:0913836583 The Orthodox Way]], [[ASIN:0823209679 Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes]], [[ASIN:0199291403 The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition: From Plato to Denys]], [[ASIN:0913836435 Orthodox Theology: An Introduction]], [[ASIN:0913836133 In the Image and Likeness of God]], any Georges Florovsky books, [[ASIN:0385500920 The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality]], [[ASIN:0811217248 New Seeds of Contemplation]], [[ASIN:B0067QUNFI An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith - Enhanced]] and [[ASIN:0140146563 The Orthodox Church: New Edition]].<br /><br />Enjoy!	2003-07-10

I do not believe all of Hauke's arguments, but to dump on the book as if its only worth is found in its being an example of false theology and reasoning is going too far. It is, rather, a highly developed apologia for a male only priesthood.<br />Concerning his point about deaconesses. It is certainly true, as Huake readily admits, that deaconesses have provided a liturgical function in relation to other women at times of baptism and anointing, or the visiting of sick women with the Eucharist during a time in history when it would have been looked down upon had a man gone into the house of a woman without others present; not that this is part of a further argument that since such social taboos are not as strong these day that it means the female deaconate has no relevance or role.<br />Concerning the point about subordination, Hauke is not playing with words in the least. He is merely extending, or applying, the traditional way of understanding the Trinity to the relation between the sexes. I would recommend Giles' \\"The Trinity and Subordinationalism\\" for anyone interested in this subject in particular. Christ is equal to the Father, but still subordinate. In the same way, the deacon is equal to the priest, but in the function of the liturgical setting, he or she is subordinate. It is a question of taxis, order, not worth. How many Christians would believe that Christ thinks to Himself, \\"I am so sick of being subordinate to the Father\\" while the Holy Spirit is just moping in the corner about being the forgotten Person of the Trinity? If you deny the distinction between subordination and worth, then that would be the ultimate conlusion.<br />A final point: There is no doubt that women and men together form the divine image as a communion of love, which God is. However, the liturgical function of presiding over the consecration of the Eucharist is of a different order. This is actually unrelated to the New Testament passages and the exegesis that is so sharply criticized. This is not what Paul or Luke we talking about. They are not talking about priests in this sense. Moreover, nowhere in the tradition (except in some heretical circles whose other theology was very screwed up) do we ever find a woman act as priest during the Eucharist. Never. While Hauke may go too far in some of his analyses, the common tradition would support what I have said.<br />This does NOT mean that the Church should never ordain women to the priesthood (which Hauke is totally against). After all, the role of deacon itself is in many respects an afterthought for logistical reasons. But let's be honest about history. The role of deacon quickly changed from waiting on tables to a highly developed liturgical function. Women were never priests and never consecrated the bread and wine. Never. Perhaps it is a matter of clarifying terms such as priest and deacon.<br />Other books of interest include Hauke's \\"God or Goddess?\\", Louis Bouyer's \\"Women in the Church\\", \\"Deaconesses\\", by Martimort, Women and the Priesthood\\" Kreeft and Hildebrand, \\"The Female Diaconate: An Historical Perspective\\" by Ellen Gvosdev, Karl Stern's \\"The Flight from Woman\\", \\"The Church and Woman\\" ed.

The seed of the Church is fed by the blood of martyrs. In a time when so much is made of supposedly Muslin martyrs, it is refreshing for Christians to recall what a true martyr is- someone who bears witness to their faith in Christ by laying down their life by the hands of persecutors. Ricciotti does an excellent job in weaving both historical narrative and quotations from primary sources to give the reader a real flavor of the stresses and glories of the early Church's position in society between 284 and 337.<br />The various forms of martyrdom are covered thoroughly. As well, an excellent prologue sets the stage for the political and religious climate of the era. It ends with a long discussion of various heresies that were rampant at the time (such as Arianism and Donatism). This is a very good source, in fact, for information of the Donatist Schism if you can't get a hold of Frend's massive study.<br />I was a bit surprised at one reviewer's remarks that this book was fit for the fire. The author of the book makes distinctions between the historical and fictional accounts of martyrdom in detail. While sympathetic to Latin Christianity, Ricciotti does not compromise his integrity as a historian. This is why I give the book five stars and the other lame review a thumbs down.<br />You may also enjoy reading \\"The Cruelty of Heresy\\" and Hengel's \\"The Cross of the Son of God\\".	2003-07-05

There are a few reasons to read this book.<br />1) Hahn does a great job in tracing the Church's teaching on the Eucharist and Christ's real presence, starting with the Scriptures and a detailed account of the earliest Christian writers and texts, many of which are of a liturgical nature.<br />2) The connection between the Passover and Christ's own sacrifice are clearly presented. He then ties this into the nature of our own participation in Christ as our only Passover lamb Who we must eat just as the Israelites ate theirs when the angel of death visited Egypt.<br />3) He gives a very detailed account of the nature of sacrifice in the Jewish cult as a precursor and type of Christ's own sacrifice.<br />4) He draws explicit connections between the Mass and the book of Revelation, allowing the reader to gain a deeper understanding of both, including the role of the saints, the angels, and chiefly the new Eve, Mary.<br />5) There is a detailed bibliography of sources cited, something sorely lacking in many of Hahn's other books!<br />I was not too surprised to find little made of the Holy Spirit's work in the mass. While Hahn draws on the Eastern Orthodox tradition in this work, he fails to make note of the epiclesis, or calling down of the Holy Spirit upon the gifts of bread and wine and the congregation to make them the very body and blood of Christ. Even so, it is a great read!<br />Other books of interest may include: \\"For the Life of the World\\", \\"Introduction to Liturgical Theology\\", and \\"Liturgy and Tradition\\" all by Alexander Schmemann; \\"The Eucharist Makes the Church\\" and \\"Sacrament of Salvation\\" both by Paul McPartlan; \\"Eucharist\\" and \\"Liturgical Piety\\" both by Louis Bouyer; Macy's \\"The Banquet's Wisdom: A short History of the Theologies of the Lord's Supper\\"; \\"The Shape of the Liturgy\\" by Gregory Dom Dix; Shea's \\"This is My Body\\"; and for some Eastern Orthodox liturgical texts that you may find very devotionally useful, \\"The Lenten Triodion\\" and \\"The Festal Menaion\\" edited and translated by Mother Mary and Kallistos Ware.

I'll quote Professor Andrew Louth's analysis of the author and the text: \\"The uneasy relationship between Orthodoxy and critical theology is being transcended in some of our younger Orthodox theologians. The most striking, and hopeful, example is this work by John Behr...Professor Behr does not take refuge in easy answers and...his Orthodoxy is radical not conservative... This is, therefore, a demanding book, requiring of its readers careful attention: but such attention will be richly repaid.\\"<br />You may also find Jaroslav Pelikan's volume one of \\"The Christian Tradition\\" engaging and scholarly.

I was so happy to come across this little gem of a book. While not exhaustive, it contains 11 chapters that clearly and simply outline the general flavor of Eastern, Byzantine Christianity.

Both books were groundbreaking and, with minor corrections, still should take a prominent place in anyones library of liturgical or sacramental studies.<br />As the sample pages show, Bouyer spends the first 119 pages exploring the Jewish context of the Eucharist, bringing to light the concepts of berakoth (liturgical formulae for blessing a meal) and tefillah (other liturgical prayers), which were immediately adopted by the early Jewish Christians.<br />He then goes through the whole of Christian history, East and West, tracing the liturgical and biblical meaning of the shared meal of the faithful.

I was reminded of Jaroslav Pelikan's outstanding book, \\"Confessor Between East and West\\" while I read Beshoner's account of Ivan Gagarin.<br />I'll quote from the conclusion to let you know where the author goes with his thesis and then you can decide if you would like to read his supporting chapters. I personally do not agree with Garagin's belief that Roman Catholicism would bring Russia its political and intellectual \\"salvation\\", but I am greatly drawn to his commitment to his ideals. Moreover, any book that even promotes the agenda of reunion, in spite of the motives, is worth noting. Enjoy!<br />\\"Personal contact with the West and the influence of such thinkers as Schelling, Chaadaevm, Ancillon, and Joufffrey led Gagarin to the conviction that Russia's social and political backwardness was directly attributable to its separation from Catholicism. By following the Byzantine Empire into schism from Rome, Russia had separated itself from the mainspring of Western social and intellectual progress; in turn, the subjugation of the Russian Church to Russian secular authority became inevitable. Garagin, therefore, reasoned that church union reattaching Russian to Catholicism would restore Russia to social and intellectual parity with the West. Seeking the best means of personally fostering this union, he joined the Society of Jesus. Gargin's choice was costly. He lost the right to visit Russian and his family; he lost his inheritance; and he suffered decades of calumny- all to save the homeland that rejected him.\\"<br />***Don't forget to check out Jaroslav Pelikan's \\"Confessor Between East and West\\"!	2003-06-28

There are several good books against Christianity, which are usually against theism in general, but this book is not one of them.<br />Despite what promised to be an interesting read, I was very disappointed by the rather amaturish historical arguments, not to mention all of those straw men. The most respected scholars of biblical and early church studies (Pelikan, Wilken, Hengel, Jeremias, etc) are much more informative and honest than this author.<br />An atheist friend of mine gave this to me, all excited that he had finally had the proof that debunked Christianity. After openly reading it, I told my buddy that all it debunks is a certain type of Protestant fundamentalism which doesn't stand up to scholarship and historical criticism. No big surprise there!

While Hall clearly is a master in his field, he falls into the common pitfall of most books of this sort. In a sense this is unavoidable, but then the title should not be taken to mean (or meant to mean) that the book covers all the main themes on a given subject in the fahters. I do not mean the minor opinions of some main fathers either. For example, in his discussion on the human condition, ,Hall fails to represent the Eastern Orthodox tradition in any way. What is represented is the typical Augustine vs. Pelagius dispute with the mediating roman council's declaration on the matter. This misses so much of what the eastern fathers have to say on the matter. Again, this is a great book, but it is not representative of the fathers as a whole. It fails to capture the patristic mind.<br />I guess my qualm is more with what I expected thebook ot be based upon teh fathers and not with the book as such, but the title should really be something more like &quot;Selected themes from selected fathers&quot;. But who, besides geeks like me, would read a book with that title?<BR>Enjoy the read!	2003-04-16

Lonergan, a famous Canadian theologian and philosopher, gradually came to intellectual conversion in the early twentieth century and this book leads the reader through his often-complex writings to explain just what it was that pulled him along to conversion- an journey that culminated in what he termed the \\"startling\\" and \\"strange\\" event of intellectual conversion.<br />If you have read Lonergan, then you'll understand that his style is quite profound and often requires hours to get though only a few pages.  The value of this book is that it synthesizes Lonergan's thought and sets it in a readable context. Very highly recommended!<br />John Henry Newman's Grammar of Assent and Lewis' Surprised By Joy are also recommended as autobiographies of intellectual conversion.<br />Enjoy!	2003-02-26

That's one way to make sense of the puzzling fact that, though membership estimates range from three to six million (record-keeping is not the faith's strong suit), the church is mostly invisible. Other Americans might recall going to a Greek wedding once, or seeing Russians troop around their church with candles at midnight, but otherwise have little awareness of this non-Protestant, non-Catholic, Christian body.<br />Thus, when something big happens in the world of Orthodox publishing, it's mostly unknown outside church circles. Something big happened four years ago, with the publication of \\"Father Arseny: Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.\\"<br />This was a translation of a book that had already sold 400,000 copies in Russia, the first open publication of a battered manuscript which had previously circulated only in carbon copy, underground.<br />American Orthodox immediately recognized \\"Father Arseny\\" as a spiritual treasure. The book is a collection of memoirs assembled by someone who calls himself \\"the servant of God Alexander.\\" The essays describe a Russian priest through the eyes of many who knew him, both during his years in a communist<br />concentration camp, and in the town where he lived till his death in 1975. Father Arseny's radical compassion and humility embody the distinctive flavor of Orthodox spirituality, and as such his story struck an immediate chord.<br />For example, the book opens with dawn in the sub-freezing gulag, as the feeble, aging priest struggles to light a fire for the barracks. Clergy were despised by everyone, even other prisoners; Christians were believed to be stupid. Yet in the course of this typical day Fr. Arseny endures beatings and<br />abuse with patience, while caring for two sick prisoners and sharing with them his rations. One invalid is a criminal, and the other a deposed official who had signed Fr. Arseny's own sentence. Through the course of succeeding chapters both become converts, and take the priest as their spiritual father.<br />The character of this kindly, long-suffering priest contrasts with the American expectation of what a successful Christian leader would be like: glib, brisk, upbeat, forceful. Fr. Arseny represents a different kind of Christian spirituality, one associated more with the Desert Fathers and early Christian spirituality.<br />Fr. Arseny differs in another way: he has contact with the supernatural. American Christian spokesmen live in an orderly, corporate sort of world, but Fr. Arseny is frequently shown at crux of miraculous events. In one incident, he and a young man are thrown into a punishment cell, a small metal cubicle<br />exposed to -22 degree temperatures. The guards expected to find both dead when they unlocked the door 48 hours later. Instead, they found the prisoners rested and radiant, with a thick coat of frost on their clothing. As the young man described it later, when he collapsed in despair he saw the dark cell flooded with light, and Fr. Arseny praying in priestly garments. The young man, like most others who knew Fr. Arseny, was transformed by his encounter.<br />These distinctively Orthodox elements, of humble compassion and spiritual power, are what made the first \\"Father Arseny\\" volume so beloved, and why the new volume has been eagerly awaited. \\"Father Arseny: A Cloud of Witnesses\\" continues the story with essays by people who knew him in the years after<br />prison, and like the first includes many tales of personal transformation and miracles.<br />When asked if other, similar samizdat works are waiting to be published, translator Vera Bouteneff says, \\"I wish, I wish. Everything I've found so far was much too sweet.\\" Her own parents fled Russia soon after the Revolution;<br />her father had been sentenced to be shot, but the order was commuted to exile. Her practical turn of mind is evident in the straightforwardness of the translation. Many other holy women and men lived during the communist era, but Bouteneff has found those accounts to be overstated and saccharine. \\"Fr. Arseny,\\" which was written by many different people of different<br />educational levels, preserves a winning directness. Those who would like to know more about Orthodox Christian spirituality can see it enacted in these books, worked out in human lives rather than in theory.<br />Soon after the publication of the first volume a story went around the internet: an Orthodox nun who had been reading the book one night turned out her light to go to sleep, looked back toward the book \\"and it was glowing. Though she hadn't heard the story, \\"I won't deny it,\\" says Bouteneff. \\"I believe in miracles.\\"nslation.

While he is sympathetic to the Catholic Church's authority structure, his reading of the history of the dogma of Papal Infallibility has lead him to understand that the doctrine has been influenced greatly by less than Christian motivations and less than Scriptural perspectives.<br />While many Catholics would reject his conclusions as based upon an inability to see the Holy Spirit's hand in history, or that he misreads the historical record (because we all know that God uses even wrong motivations to accomplish His will), I still think that they could find much value in this book since it will help them to understand the perspective of critics of the Church's dogmatic formation on the principle of authority.<br />As an Eastern Orthodox, I found it useful for the same reasons, disagreeing with the author at various times, but overall appreciative of his analysis. It is not a fluffy book that skims the surface and it is very well-written.	2003-02-08

Lacking believability, even miracles aside (which I do believe are possible), the topper is the daughter, Swede. There is no way that any nine year old can do all the things that she does. Please understand that I can \\"go along\\" with the idea for the sake of the story, but it came to be ridiculous after a few chapters. Moreover, the fundamental problem of the novel, the son's crime, could easily have been solved in so many other ways using the father's powers of will, prayer, and miraculous intervention. It was just too silly and convenient for the author to selectively use such character traits only when they suited his rather thin plot.<br />The weaknesses aside, the author does know how to turn a phrase and many passages are a pleasure to read for their descriptive power.	2003-02-05

His style is smooth and easy to follow, although it really would help if the reader had some background in theology (but not much!). Take a look at the sample pages for a taste. This is one of the best intros to Orthodox theology in English and I recommend it heartily! Enjoy!<br />You may also be interested in Jordan Bajis' \\"Common Ground\\".

I love Morrissey and The Smiths, so this book could be written [bad] and I would still like it. But fortunately Rogan is a gifted writer who loves the subject matter even more than I do!<br />You'll learn way more than you ever wanted to know about the band and the split between Johnny Marr and Steve Morrissey from this at times obsessively accurate and detailed account. I was struck by how weird Morrissey really is. His odd antics in print and life are not an act. He really is an odd duck. But isn't that why we love him so much? He speaks for all of us when he whines, moans, and sighs about life's missed opportunities, unrequited loves, and the mystery of personal identity.<br />Included are dozens of photos of everyone involved in the whole saga. It is a really great read! Enjoy!<br />\\"It's so easy to laugh. It's so easy to hate. It takes guts to be gentle and kind...I know it's over, and it never really began.

Farrell is a brilliant thinker with the ability to sustain several highly detailed discussions at the same time in an original manner that sheds a much needed light on the questions that seem to plague the East-West discussion over humanity's freedom and GOd's providence. THis is a difficult book even for someone experienced with the subject matter, so be prepared to take some time to chew on this before swallowing!<br />The analysis of Augustin in light of Maximos was the best part for me, since it is so central to so many debates among Christians. He starts his section of Augustin withthe interesting quote from Karl Barth that, \\"all the dubious features of Calvin's doctrine [of predestination] result from the basic failing that in the last analysis he seperates God and Jesus Christ.\\" Very good reading!

For those who have yet to read this master, I can only say, \\"Be diligent and search for his books.\\" It is well worth the hunt.<br /><br />In this volume of his works, Florovsky tackles such questions as creation, redemption, evil, the motive of the incarnation, the meaning of the incarnation, redemption, the ever-virgin Mary, the veneration of the saints, the immortality of the soul, and last things. With a strong blend of scripture and patristics, informed by the eastern worship and practice, Florovsky masterfully leads the reader into the heart of the eastern Church. Some of his writing can be dry, but this volume is quite readable and as relevant now as it was in the 1970s.

I have been greatly aided by this book in my understanding of the connection and \\"common ground\\" between the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics via two sainted theologians of the east and west- Gregory Palamas and Thomas Aquinas. I noticed what in my mind is a major problem. She seems to think the energies/essence distinction, so critical to the orthodox idea of deification, is a mere terminalological one. That can't be. I may be wrong, but I think it is a dogmatic distinction. Why she does this I cannot say. It is such a basic mistake. Maybe it is to make her thesis stronger, showing that east and west are more similar than they really are in fact. That notwithstanding, the book is really good.<br /><br />I could go on about the book, but the sample pages speak for themsleves. Please see some of my other reviews for books of similar interest, esp my list of ecumenical books. If you are really interested in this sort of topic, then you should really consider buying \\"[[ASIN:0788503456 Energies of the Spirit: Trinitarian Models in Eastern Orthodox and Western Theology (American Academy of Religion Academy Series)]]\\" by Duncan Reid. It is also very detailed and insightful (it looks at trinitarian models in east and west). [[ASIN:0521035562 Aristotle East and West: Metaphysics and the Division of Christendom]] is also along the lines of Williams, but I beleive with more nuance, showing that the centrality of apophaticism is key to understanding that the Orthodox do not think we can understand God in the terms of the Western tradition, but that we can and do participate in God's life through God's energies, while the West has God stand off some, enjoyed through the beautific vision, but not a true participation. Certianly these are topics of serious consequence.	2003-01-16

THis is a good thing, says Dawn, buut our sexuality needs to be in function of God's design.

This is certainly one of the better books on the history and diversity of Okinawan martial arts. Bishop has done English speakers a great service in going to the masters themselves to get firsthand accounts of the inner teachings and foundations of the respective traditions, demonstrating that Okinawa is the home, or the cross-roads, to dozens of unique fighting arts as well as a profound philosophy of co-existence and harmony.<br /><br />Great attention to detail is given, mostly owing to the author's first hand accounts of his own training with most of the living masters he describes, along with painstaking details of lineage. There are many rare or just unusual photographs along with the old standards. The binding is pretty good, too.<br /><br />The only weaknesses of this book come from Bishop's broad approach. True, he is usually quite accurate, but many of his histories are the politically correct or popular versions told to most people or the ones in accordance with the lineages as they are on paper. Having firsthand experience in training for nearly twenty years on a personal level with many Okinawan karate-ka of the \\"old school\\" (students of Gusukuma, Chibana, Miyahira, Motobu, etc) it is becoming more and more clear to me that there are always multiple histories, depending upon the audience and the questioner. Bishop cannot be faulted for any missing or incorrect aspect of his account (who could get it all right?) but it is still there in the oral traditions among the older generation that grew up in the pre and post-war era.<br /><br />Highly recommended, along with[[ASIN:0910704961 Unante]] by John Sells, which I have found to be the most complete one-stop-shopping book on the market for Okinawan martial history and technique for serious researchers/practitioners.

As a man marked by deep lonliness and uncertainty, Henri was truly the wounded healer about which he wrote so movingly.<br /><br />Each of the stories in this book show just how a simple touch, a loving glance, a kind word, or a quiet presence can affect the life of another person. The majority of the stories are by people who knew Henri for some time, with others reflecting upon brief encounters. There are a few by some of the members his community who are mentally slower. These are very moving and remind me that God uses us to love each other, that we are His hands. More than that, it shows the simple, childlike beauty of the mentally handicapped.

Turnbull is a detailed historian, known for many works on Japanese warfare. THis book is no exception to his high standard of quality.<br />Drawing on personal research and a familiarity with the primary sources, Turnbull weaves an exciting tale.<br />Great illustrations. I was, however, suprised that he didn't make more of Hastumi Masaaki. I understnad that Hatsumi is not albe to produce written documentation for all of his nine ryu, but it seemed odd that his is only mentioned in passing a few times.

It is easy to see why such a claim was made when one reads The Two Natures In Christ. Chemnitz's magnum opus set the stage early on as a standard defense and reference work on the two natures of Jesus Christ.  The title page reads: &quot;A monograph concerning the two natures in Christ, their hypostatic union, the communication of their attributes, and related questions, recently revised and prepared on the basis of Scripture and the witness of the ancient church by Dr. Martin Chemnitz...&quot; No library of dogmatics can be complete without this excellent reference work of 542 pages.<br />Consisting of 33 chapters, this book exhaustively examines what the council of Chalcedon declared to be true orthodoxy in the year 451. <br />Other books of interest may include: God In Patristic THought by Prestige, Christ in Eastern Christian Thought by Meyendorff, Trinity and Incarnation by Basil Studer, Incarnation-Myth or Fact? by Skarsaune, Christology by Gerald O'Collins, On the Person of Christ by Wesche, the 3 volume work by Grillmeier (Christ in Christian Tradition), Raymond Brown's An Introduction to New Testament Christology, The Gospel Image of Christ by Kesich, The Cruelty of Heresey by Allison.

I will never be able to find myself if I isolate myself from the rest of mankind as if I were a different kind of being.<br />Later: Hatred recoils from the sacrifice and the sorrow that are the price of this resetting of bones. It refuses the pain of reunion. There is in every weak, lost and isolated member of the human race an agony of hatred born of his own helplessness, his own isolation. Hatred is the sign and the expression of lonliness, of unworthiness, of insufficieny. And in so far as each one of us is lonely, is unworthy, each one hates himself.<br />Please buy this book.

This slim volume is, as the jacket says, the first history of Japanese theology written by Japanese theologians. It is long overdue. As Carl Michelson wrote in the 1960s (Japanese Contributions to Christian Theology), &quot;Protestant Christianity is only one hundred years old in Japan. That means the Japanese church is one of the younger churches in Christendom. Yet, of all the younger churches, it is apprently the first to have developed a significant theology.&quot;<br />Furuya's book explores three generations of theologians in Japan, outlining the various challenges to the faith and the creative responses from several key thinkers. Dohi, Sato, Yagi, and Masaya are the central theologians covered, while others also appear.<br />Both Catholic and Protestant theologians are covered. Not much is made of the Eastern Orthodox (who have also been in Japan via Russia for some time).<br />This is an overall good book, well written and organized. And if you are interested in Japan and Christianity, do read Endo's works. He is one of the greatest writers of Japan and happens to be a convert to Christianity. His works explore themes of Christ, suffering, conversion, and the Japanese heart. Enjoy!	2002-12-28

Emil Brunner, a Lutheran theologian, once wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If a Lutheran does not know why he not a catholic, he doesn't know why he is a Lutheran.&quot; Such a statement reflects the fact that Lutheranism is in many respects understood only within the catholic framework from which it was born. Unlike nearly all Protestant sects, Lutheranism is traditionally highly liturgical and sacramental. This is unfortunately changing.<br />So many Lutherans are getting tired of the &quot;let's beat drums, get revved up, and reinvent the Christian liturgical 'wheel' each year&quot; mentality that has taken hold ELCA and a large part the LCMS (and parts of the Roman Church). This book reflects some of the discouragement with such &quot;renewal&quot;, which owes much to the historical amnesia that has clouded over the Lutheran church in recent decades, causing it to forget its catholic heritage in favor of pop trends and &quot;let's bring 'em in&quot; showmanship which has turned the altar into a stage.<br />Each of the 11 chapters is well-written and makes the typical arguments about the weakness and ahistorical nature of such a fundamental Lutheran teaching like sola scriptura, the importance of the pope, the role of Mary and the saints, etc. The role of tradition is at stake here, and each writer has thrown their vote with the historical record of Rome.<br />I am not a Roman Catholic, but I am a former Lutheran, and many of these articles hit home. I kept saying to myself, &quot;Yup, I remember coming to that realization too!&quot;<br />There are many Catholic books out there to get you to rethink Protestantism- Scoot Hahn, Stephen Ray, Tom Howard, etc.<br />If you are thinking that you really want to stay in the Lutheran communion instead of jumping ship, then I would heartily recommend the works of Carl Braaten, especially his &quot;Mother Church: Ecclesiology and Ecumenism&quot;, which in part argues that Lutherans need to return to their roots in an episcopal office. It is well worth the time. You may find yourself a lifelong frustrated Lutheran, but hey, someone needs to do it!<br />I would, of course, prod you to look at some Eastern Orthodox books, to keep everything balanced.

Skarsaune is a master historian of early Christian dogma, and in this book he focuses upon the central claim of the faith- that God became man in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. What makes this book so unique is that it is not too overwhelming, at only 176 pages, and that it clearly shows that the early church's christology is rooted firmly in 1st century Judaism  and not in some hellenic syncritism as is so often heard. Using primary sources on every page, Skarsaune also demonstrates what impact the Greek world had upon the expression of this fundamentally Jewish messianic concept that had definite implications for how Christians (Jew and Greek) understood their experience of God in Christ.<br /><br />Also, he proves that it wasn't the plurality of the godhead that so offended the Jews, but, like the offence it casues to Muslims (although Muslims do not allow for anything but strict monotheism), they were appalled that God would suffer and die at the hands of His own creation. The smae went for the Greeks, which is why St Paul can call the cross the \\"scandalon\\" that stumbles the Jews and offends the Greeks.<br /><br />Just an awesome book that is readily available, even though it is out of print. Study questions are included, making it a great resource for adult study groups.<br /><br />With a great index, detailed endnotes, and a great bibiliography, this book is unbeatable at only 176 pages. You can't go wrong here! Enjoy!<br /><br />You may also be interested in his new book, In The Shadow Of The Temple, which traces the Jewsih origins of the early Church. It is very well done!

His style is catchy and he interviews scholars who have engaged the historical questions surrounding Christ in honest and thoughtful ways. It reads smoothly. There are some points that are a bit cheesy, but it is stylistic rather than content-based. I'll let you be the judge.<br />Now, concerning gnosticism and \\"secret knowledge\\" this book does none of the sort. If historical research is somehow thought to be \\"secret knowledge\\", then certain readers will find this book offensive. Moreover, if you think that you need to check your brain in at the door to believe in Christ, then this book may challenge your assumptions about \\"faith\\". If, on the other hand, you are looking to be able to give an account of what you believe to an unbelieving generation, then this book is a good place to start. Again, the Church has always sought to prove that Christ was who he said he was. This is why the prophecies and typologies of the Hebrew Canon are so important. OUr faith is grounded in history. Having \\"faith\\" is salvific, but saying that doesn't cut the mustard to a skeptic. After all, faith's context is history and the acting of God in history. To try to seperate the two, to put faith outside of its historical context, is exaclty what gnosticism did and continues to do! This is exactly what Strobel is writing against! And in an age when the western world thinks Christianity is synonomous with the pentacostal emotionalism or the wealth gospel, a little history lesson can reorient the skeptic to the true faith.<br />...<br /><br />...	2002-12-28

I was really interested in this book for two reasons. First, it allows modern Lutherans (LCMS and LCWS) to move away from their typically myopic, one-sided christology that sees the incarnation in Anselmian terms wherein Christ is born to &quot;pay the price&quot; to satisfy the wrath of an angry Father who needs to punsih someone to let us off the hook for our sins both original and actual, thus pitting God's love against His justice. While there is some truth to this theory of atonement, it is far too narrow. It hardly is representative of the great tradition of the Church (or the Scriptures).<br />The second benefit of this book is that it sets the groundwork for productive talks between Eastern Orthodox and Lutherans. For the Orthodox, God's economic dealings with humans in Christ extend far beyond the satisfaction model of the West. Following the Scriptures and the Fathers, the Orthodox stress that God became man that man might become God. For the Orthodox, the humanity's end and purpose is theosis, or deification. Union With Christ deals explicitly with this theme in Luther, and so opens up a welcome path for dialogue.<br />Other books of similar interest include:  Salvation in Christ: A Lutheran-Orthodox Dialogue by John Meyendorff (Editor), et al; Heaven on Earth: A Lutheran-Orthodox Odyssey by Robert Tobias; Christus Victor by Gustaf Aulen; Common Ground, by Jordan Bajis; and On the Incarnation, by Saint Athanasius.<br />Enjoy!	2002-12-24

Thompson is a master scholar, elucidating the concept and experience of God in the Gospel of St John. She posits that God the Father is the main subject of the gospel, and taht only in relation to the Father is Jesus properly understood as the one who is &quot;with God&quot; and &quot;is God&quot;. An interesting analysis of the Paraclete reveals that the Spirit is not some sort of replacement for the risen Christ, but one of the Father's &quot;two hands&quot;.<br />This is really a needed work. She is right in stressing the fact that approaching God by means other than the Father can distort John's purpose. For he uses Jesus as the person who revales the face of the Father to us. There is a tendancy in exegesis to hold orthodox positions (i.e., that Jesus is actually God equal to the Father) for the wrong reasons, thus leaving orthodoxy open to criticisms that really are unfounded. Thompson's book is a needed corrective in this regard. Enjoy this great book!<br />Thompson's other great books, The Promise of the Father and The Incarnate Word are really worth looking into.

At the core of our alleged differences is the role of Islamic fundamentalism with its hegemonic determination to dominate cultures both in the Middle East and abroad. Such views are not new. The \\"clash of civilizations\\" theory of Samuel Huntington had already proposed and popularized this understanding in the mid-1990s.  At a time when this perspective is gaining momentum, it is helpful to seek a corrective to a myopic understanding of Islam that often accompanies Huntington's theory; namely, that Islam is nothing more than Wahhabism.  Moreover, a historical reexamination of Christianity's own understanding of God can be beneficial for \\"Westerners\\" who tend to understand their own religious heritage typically through modern Protestant lenses, which often leads to the positing of false dichotomies between Islam and Christianity, seeing them as mutually exclusive with no common ground. By reconsidering the mystical theologies of each religion it can be shown that a fundamental convergence occurs in the mystical thought and experience of each tradition. In particular, this inner commonality can form the basis of a deeper conversation between Christians and Muslims than has been typical in our day, aiding in a clearer mutual understanding of the similarities that exist between the fundamental religious traditions of our cultures. To this end, Paths To The Heart is an excellent beginning.<br />As Thomas Merton said in his Conjectures:<br />\\"Le point vierge is in everybody, and if we could see it we would see the billions of points of light coming together in the face and blaze of a sun that would make all the darkness and cruelty of life vanish completely...I have no program for this seeing.

But unity in what belief is the critical question. Bishop Kallistos Ware provides an excellent tool for those interested in this key question, or active in the ecumenical movement. Drawing upon Scripture, Patristics, Liturgy and modern orthodox theologians, Ware outlines the Eastern Orthodox position on the question of intercommunion and communion. While he does not support intercommunion (of the interdenominational sort), he compassionately and clearly explains why such a stance is grounded in the unbroken tradition of the Church. Basic to this premise is that communion is a sign of a preexisting communion of faith and order, a joyful proclamation of unity in belief and practice. In this sense, intercommunion is a bit illogical and untruthful since the parties involved do not always hold a common faith, thus negating the very act of communion. An unfortunate result of such practices is the rationalizing away of any so-called \\"minor\\" differences between the parties, leading to a \\"least common denominator\\" approach to the faith which is so typical in our times. The end result is an anemic Christology and Ecclesiology, leading many to ask, \\"What exactly does such a Eucharist represent other than warm feelings?\\" (Although Ware himself is not a bit polemic in his presentation.) He also addresses the question in relation to baptism. Some argue analogically that if baptism is seen as Christ's and not the Church's, then the eucharist is as well. Ware points out that this is a flawed view, since all of the sacraments/holy mysteries are both vertical and horizontal in their meaning. They are Christ's, but the Church is the very Body of Christ, and the Church is a visible unity of that one Body. Again, more can be said about the important difference between heretics and schismatics, since that has some bearing on the issue, as does the Orthodox notions of oikonomia (economy).<br /><br />An invisible ecclesiology is more convenient for superficial patch-up jobs that gloss over real differences, but such a view has nothing to do with either the New Testament or the earliest (or later) patristic/liturgical tradition, as demonstrated by Werner Elert, John Zizioulas and others. I am afraid that conclusions to the contrary are more rooted in starting with a conclusion and twisting texts and ignoring strong evidence to the contrary. The intention is correct, but not the conclusion. Sort of like premarital sex! It seems right at the time, and maybe even on paper, but it misses the point of sex's role in God's plan for us.<br /><br />Those who will want communion at the expense of doctrinal unity should consider exactly what it is that constitutes the faith once delivered to the saints, and this becomes a question of what constitutes authority and what constitutes legitimate tradition (see [[ASIN:158617021X The Meaning of Tradition]] and [[ASIN:0536001731 Tradition & Traditions]]). If the least common denominator theology is true, then Orthodox, Lutherans and Roman Catholics are wrong. I have tried over the years to disprove the \\"close communion\\" view, but alas I return again to the Orthodox teaching of the ages.<br /><br />One final note in this book: It is a very slim volume and has large type. I found the print annoying to read.<br /><br />Read Werner Elert's [[ASIN:0570042704 Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the First Four Centuries]] for a detailed account of the early communion and intercommunion practices in the Church.

Bishop Zizioulas presents a very systematic defense of the Eastern Orthodox understanding, and relevance, of Trinitarian theology. He shows how the starting point of the Trinity is not the essence, as is often the case in western theology, but with the persons- Father, Son, Spirit. Commenting on western, essense first approach, he writes:     \\"This interpretation represents a misinterpretation of the Patristic theology of the Trinity. Among the Greek Fathers the unity of God, the one God, and the ontological 'principle' or 'cause' of the being and life of God does not consist in the one substance of God but in the hypostasis, that is, the person of the Father. The one God is not the one substance but the Father, who is the cause both of the generation of the Son and the procession of the Spirit. Consequesntly, the ontological 'principle' of God is traced back, once again, to the person.\\" (page40-41)    This line of thought runs thru the whole text, linking personhood with being in the ontological sense. Moreover, he draws various ecclesiological conclusions about he role of the bishop in the church catholic. He builds a eucharistic ecclesiology around some of his reading of the Greek Patristic tradition that fits well with much of modern Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic thought.     This book has had a very wide influence among theologians. SOme other books taht may be of related interest are: God For Us, by LaCugna (although I think she misses the point of the Cappadocians); The One the Three and the Many, by Gunton; The Tripersonal God, by O'Collins; The Eucharist Makes the Church, by McPartlan; The Sacrament of Salvation by McPartlan; Theology in the Russian Diaspora, by Nichols; Altogether Gift, by Downey; Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the First Four Centuries, by Werner Elert (very thorough); After Our Likeness, by Volf; Flesh of the Church, Flesh of Christ, by Tillard; God as Communion, by Fox and The God of the Gospel of John by Thompson.    THese books all concern themsleves with the ideas of how communion and fellowship are defined and experienced within the life and teachings of the Church based upon the life of God, in Whom we live, move and have our being. Some are very original. I would also recommend the works of Kallistos Ware, Volume One and Two of his Collected Works for similar themes.     Ut Unum Sint.     Enjoy!	2002-12-24

I only want to say that for those friends of mine who have read the book a few times, they have all been helped on a deep level to think more clearly about the nature of faith and religion. Truly it is above all a relationship with a living person (or three!).<br />I would also recommend &quot;Every Branch In Me&quot;, which bulids upon the same themes found in this book.

Mascall	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Hilarious, insightful account of a theologian's life	I laughed out loud countless times while reading this book.<br />Mascall is one of the great anglican theologians of the 20th century, and his memoirs span decades of reflecting upon the Christian message and the sometimes odd respones that his writings have generated.<br />He starts off with his birth, and moves on thru his school days, his interest in theology, and his role in teaching at various schools. He also comments upon his books and lectures and the stories behind their origins. He offers great comments about some of the people he met during his life; Gregory Dom Dix, for example.<br />I cannot tell you how funny it is. I just read another part as i wrote this and i am laughing so hard! Please look for this book- you won't put it down.	2002-12-24

Each essay examines the main currents of thought for each person and their influnece upon the world in this century. Included are essays about St. Seraphim of Sarov, Sergius Bulgakov, MAria Skobtsova, Fr. Lev Gillet, Paul Evdokimov, Fr. Gregory Krug, Nicholas Afanasiev, Fr. Alexander Schmemann, Fr. Jean Meyendorff, and Fr. Alexander Men. With many first-hand accounts of their lives, the author gives keen insights into their personalities, the context of their actions and writings, and their continuing relevance for the 21st century.<br />I would also recommend &quot;Light From The East&quot; by Aidan Nichols for an intro to some other Orthodox thinkers. It is out of print, but available from time to time. Enjoy!	2002-10-05
