While I do agree with some of the things that Phillips presents here, I think that if Phillips is truly concerned about inequality of wealth here in America, he should go after these senators, congressmen and other government employees who want to &quot;fix social security&quot; but refuse to contribute to it yet have their own super retirement programs that will provide a million dollar retirement income and they (the senators, congressmen etc) never  have to pay a dime into it and never contribute to social security (or is that social insecurity?)<br />I think it's time to shake up America and history has shown that Kevin Phillips is the man who can do that. So c'mon Mr. Phillips. Why not write a book and expose the great social security scandal that is going on in this great country. Expose these  politicians who talk out of both sides of their mouths. Expose these Senators and Congressmen who claim they are working for the common good but could care less about anybody but themselves. Do a book on social security before it truly does become social insecurity and leaves millions of Americans, our elderly pennyless and possibly homeless as well.<br />Great job on Wealth &amp; Democracy.

Historically, after two bad years, the markets rebound. The real bull market didn't start untill later that year in October 2002 and it has been non-stop even since.More to the point, Wade suggested thatt he markets would be in a trading range and that is exctly as it happened. The Enron and other debacles were events no one could have predicted, but they made for better trades if you followed Wade's strategies.In another regard, Wade, I believe showed the proud American spirit that s within him and did his part to bring faith back in America and the stock market.Makes you wonder who really wrote all of those  star reviews doesn't it?I also recommend Red Light Green Light, Mr. Cook's newest book.

Wha has always baffled me is why some people get such great results while others, on the same program go nowhere!I sincerely believe that Dr. Phil has captured the answer. As with Dr. Phils other books, his concept is to create yourself from the inside out. Many people would like to be trim and fit but many times lack the mental toughness to get the job done.Dr. Phil has the answers. In this new book by Dr. Phil you can develop the mental attitude of a thin person, that is, a formerly overweight person who became thin.As for the allegations that Dr. Phil is not a medical Dr., so what? If medical Dr's had the answers why are their patients still so fat?Weight loss requires a total approach and Dr. Phil in his Ultimate Weight-Loss Solution.Regarding the allegations that Dr. Phil is capitalizing on weight-loss with his book and various products, again I say so what? Would it make you feel better if Dr. Phil recommended a particular weight-loss center or health club chain? Then you guys would accuse him of being a shill for other companies! C'mon!!!!Besides, there are a lot of products out there in the diet market place that are absolute junk; low fat, low calorie but high sugar and low nutrition stuff endorsed by celebrities who will hype anything they get paid for.Getting back to my experience as a weight loss consultant and fitness trainer, I have found that those who got the best results did so by following a program that included diet and exercise and also did some mental programming such as setting goals, reciting affirmations and most importantly, believing they could and would get results.Those who failed seemed to think it was okay to be overweight and also lacked the necessary discipline. They couldn't visualize themselves as being thinner and fitter. They also thought it was okay to be as they were (after awhile) and pretty much went back to theirpassive lifestyle and poor eating habits.Dr. Phil has something here. It can make a difference for you.	2003-10-05

But it saved me substantially more during that last bear market which was the worst bear market in over 60 years.Using Wade's advice, I even made money on stock splits like Christopher &amp; Banks, Loews and ADSK during a bear market!Switching to low beta stocks as Wade advises in this book also saved me tens of thousands.PRIOR TO WADE I used to follow advice from my broker and that advice was making me broker. Mr. Cook teaches you how to select a broker that will work for you (many won't and prefer to sell the stock of the day rather than what is best for you) and I suspect that allof the negative reviews are from stock brokers who don't want you to you what their game really is.I highly recommend BEAR MARKET BALONEY currently known as Wall Street Money Machine #3.

Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter consists of 6 tapes for a whopping 9 hrs. of financial education.The program covers the first three Rich Dad books: Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflw Quadant and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing.Although abridged, the real &quot;meat&quot; is here and if you are like me, you will find listening to the tapes along with reading the books will help you learn fter, easier and better.Good luck and good listening!	2003-06-01

More Wealth w/o Risk is certaintly one of the all time classics in personal finance and wealth building. Perhaps even the best all around best personal finance book ever.For me, I found the personal finance strategies very useful, saved a bundle on various insurances and credit cards.The tax advice got me into a zero tax bracket. I do literally travel the world on tax deductible dollars and even deduct health club and golf club memberships.The investment advice also saved and made me a small fortune. Using Givens patented &quot;money movement strategy&quot; had me in the right investments at the right time and out of the wrong investments when necessary.My only complaint: I wish there was an updated version.None the less, More Wealth w/o Risk is still better than most, if not allof the financial books available on the stands right now.	2003-05-24

Books	5	831	928	N	N	Not for Harvard graduates	This book is definitely not for Harvard graduates. Typical Harvard graduates are too busy updating their resumes and pounding the pavement trying to find a j-o-b just like the one they just got downsized from to benefit from a book like this.On the other hand, for people who are willing to be changed; are sick and tired of the rat race; tired of paying for somebodyelse's dreams; tired of having their boss determine how many sick days they deserve or how many vacation days they can take will enjoy and benefit from this book.  I also recommend Loopholes of the Rich and The Business School for People who like helping people.Slams at network marketing people by 1 star reviewers are predictable and stale.  Question 1 stars: How is your lifestyle? What kind of car do you drive? Where do you go to vacation? How much did you pay in taxes last year?The investment advice is also right on. Just talk to all of the people who are losing money following conventionable advice.A house is an asset? Yes, if you are the bank. If you want to turn a house into an asset, it's very simple, do what banks do and become a real estate investor.As for that website that keeps getting mentioned here, if it really was that good there would be no need to repeatedly mention it here would there?RDPD is a OUTSTANDING book.  I highly recommend it.My motto is: I'll do today what others won't so I can do tommorrow what others can't.The recipe is simple; just follow Kiyosaki's advice.	2003-05-24

I am amused at some of the reviews of this great book by arguably the greatest bodybuilder of all time - Anold Schwarzenneggar.Those of us who were around a couple decades ago show the great evolution of Arnold's physique. Arnold transformed himself from a very beefy and unsymetrical better than average Mr. Universe competitor to a six time Mr. Universe and 7 time Mr. Olympia and probably the greatest of all time.This training system will not lead to overtraining. That said, Arnold does not recommend that you start off with 20 sets per bodypart and train six days per week.Remember too that Arnold recommends supplements and large amountS of protein. At his peak, Arnold was ingesting 150 dessicated liver tablets, 3 dozen eggs and 3-5 lbs of beef PER DAY!Fans of the Mentzer system will not like Arnolds techniques, but Arnolds system will generate better overall results.To the individual that suggested doing front deltoid raises with thumbs up rather than palms down as Arnold suggests, obviously you are new to training. It may be safer, but it doesn't work the deltoids as well. Why not just stick to inclines?I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to achieve their best in physical development.	2003-05-24

I really wasn't a fan of Dr. Wayne Dyer until I read this book and used his Meditation tape-Meditation for Manifesting.In There Is A Siritual Solution For Every Problem, Dr. Dyer starts off by telling us that the numer 1 thing to do in order t reach spiritual consciouness is to let the past go. Further, Dr. Dyer says to embrace the past and then get rid of it.Then Dr. Dyer goes on to explain the need for surrender in order to get closer to God. He says that most of our problems stem from the belief in two powers: Good vs. evil. There is only one power in the universe, and the only problem you have is the belief that you are separate from God.Dr. Dyer then teaches that emptying your mind through meditation (surrender) is the only way you can really come to know God.Then Dr. Dyer describes how to move to the higher frequencies (where one can be closest to God) He says that you must eliminate fear, shame, guilt (lowest frequencies) to joy, love and peace (highest frequencies) to be healed and have our problems solved.Finally, Dr. Dyer reiterates the teachings of St Francis and the benefits of thinking, loving, positive thoughts, for this is how we become empowered. Here the focus is on applying love, where there is hate, light where there is darkness, and so on. Dr. Dyer suggests that by concentrating on power vs. force, we can earn respect, learn valuable life lessons, and move into a higher frequency.Those who are familiar with Dr. Dyers earlier works, like Erroneous Zones and Pulling Your Own Strings may not like this. I see this book alog with Your Sacred Self as a positive move for Dr. Dyer. I also highly suggest the tape-Meditations For Manifesting for dramatic and rapid changes.Dr. Dyer, great book.	2002-08-28

Really?How did these billionaires and the rich acquire their wealth? I assure you that it wasn't from the government.The problem with this book is that it preys to the rich should take care of the poor mentality. That the rich should pay more in taxes and reduce what the poor have to pay. Actually, anyone who is financially savvy, knows how to reduce their taxes without the rich paying the tab.I can't argue with Phillips historical data but I believe that Phillips sends out the wrong message (deliberately??)to attract people who would prefer to rationalize for their lack of wealth and blame it on politics and supposed opportunities that the rich have and are unavailable to them. BULL!Poeple need to get off their duffs. Read empowering books like The Millionaire Next Door which Phillips takes a poke at and leave excuse filled books like this one alone. Get to work.Someone once said that you can make money or make excuses. I contend that this book is attempting to make excuses just like Profits and Politics did back in 1990. Interesting is that the stock market and the economy grew dramaticly right after Profits & Power was released. Deju Vu????My recommendtion is to buy good books like Millionaire Next Door and leave this one for the intellectual excuse makers.The same kind of people that watch the evening news, read newsweek and polute their minds with garbage love this sort of junk.	2002-07-19

The biggest expence we face, more than our mortgages, putting children through college or buying cars is taxes. This excellent book by Wade Cook saved me $... last year.So much information: Nevada Corporations, income splitting. entity integration, tax credits, gifting and so much more. I have always advocated filing the long form, not the short form while filing your taxes to make taxpayers more tax aware. This book really lets out all the stops. You really can get rich despite the tax laws if you follow Wade Cooks advice. Brilliant Deductions is a brilliant book that will open your eyes to what is available. Use what you can now and then add more strategies as they apply to you.Last Fall, I invested in section 29 tax credits for the first time. While a minor strategy, I recieved a major gain  100%, plus a nice dividend and a tax credits to offset taxable income. I know some people who still spend money to create tax deductions.... Not too shabby.Great book for anyone who wants to minimize taxes.	2001-02-27
