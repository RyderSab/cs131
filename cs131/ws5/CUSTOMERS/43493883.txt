It follows the whole \\"leave well enough alone\\" axiom. Good books can be like that.<br /><br />Some authors have successfully rewritten William Shakespeare, making him more accessible to the masses. (See Gertrude and Claudius by John Updike or Gertrude Talks Back by Margaret Atwood for good examples.) The newer versions of Shakespeare's works are often written in more modern, plain language with updated settings. Fine - it works.<br /><br />It seems a mistake to try and retell a story that is the basis for the most popular book on earth. A book that has been on the bestseller lists since it was first printed. A book, I might add, that was the very first book to ever be printed (in 1455 by Johannes Gutenberg).<br /><br />Written by the vaguely identified \\"Two Brothers from Berkeley\\" (actually Jack Sparks and Paul Raudenbush), Letters to Street Christians is an attempt to retell the Bible stories in such a way that more people can grasp them. The book was reprinted in 2003, but originally published in 1971. Now maybe in 1971 Letters was successful in its mission. But in 2004, it's a considerable flop.<br /><br />Apparently back in 1971, the only thing you had to do to make some flowery language relevant to your audience was say \\"Dig it!\\" every now and then. Because that's what these brothers do. The rest of the text is just like reading the real deal - the language is obtuse and it takes a close reading and lots of interpretation to get anywhere.<br /><br />The Bible is not some book that can't be rewritten. I think the story is a valuable one full of lessons and meaning for any reader. Mel Gibson wowed (many, but not all) people with The Passion of The Christ. C.S. Lewis made many allusions to the Bible story in his Narnia chronicles. If Gibson, Lewis and the hundreds if not thousands if not millions like them can be successful, why not two brothers from Berkeley?<br /><br />The Brothers start out to \\"rap to a person at a level he's hip to.\\" And therein lies part of their problem. In 1971 they were probably, or possibly, very current. Back then rapping wasn't a form of music and people still said things like \\"at a level he's hip to.\\" But now their language is just as antiquated as that of the original authors of the Bible. And frankly, less good.out to \\"rap to a person at a level he's hip to.\\" And therein lies part of their problem. In 1971 they were probably, or possibly, very current.

Aspirations of superpowers in small children are nothing new. One little boy thinks he cam fly. Another little girl thinks she can fight evil. A little boy thinks he can turn into a fly. A little girl... Wait. A fly?<br /><br />Jim Munroe's Flyboy Action Figure Comes with Gasmask begins an average story about an average guy named Ryan who lives with his average roommates and is an average student and does a below-average job of picking up women. One day while at his regular haunt - the coffee house - Ryan gets up the nerve to ask out Cassandra, the waitress he has been admiring from afar.<br /><br />Cassandra is less than average. She used to play in a famous punk rock band. She is an ardent feminist, sometimes lesbian and single mom. And she can turn invisible.<br /><br />Average Ryan might be intimidated by this fact if it weren't for his own ability to turn into a fly. That's right, a fly. In Flyboy, Ryan discovers early on in childhood that he can indeed turn into a fly.<br /><br />Now before you go off assuming that this is some modern-day remake of David Cronenberg's 1986 hit The Fly, know that in this tale boy meets girl and girl does not shoot boy as he turns into some grotesque creature. In fact, Flyboy is only a small part science fiction, believe it or not.<br /><br />When a girl who can turn invisible meets a boy who can turn into a fly, there is no other choice than for the two to become superheroes.<br /><br />Right?<br /><br />If those argument is not a reasonable one to you, than neither will be most of the plot of Flyboy. However, if you can accept this shaky premise, then Flyboy makes for what is actually a sweet, though quirky, story.	2004-08-04

This is a horrible thing for a book critic to admit, no? I mean, how can I be unbiased in my reviews if I think some books should be regarded in more esteem than others?<br />There are some books that are created for little more than pleasure. I don't think these books serve a lesser purpose. I think that grocery store romance novels provide entertainment and possible delight to their readers. Someone I know once purchased a connect-the-dots book of pornography to give as a birthday gift. That book possibly offered hours of entertainment. Every time I graduate, someone gives me an inspirational book of quotes. Sure, some of them are good, but after a quick read through, what am I supposed to do with it? Tape the quotes to my bathroom mirror? Um, no.<br />The Spy's Guide to Office Espionage by H. Keith Melton and Craig Piligian with Duane Sweirczynski offers little more than brief entertainment. (I suppose for people who are truly set on bugging their co-workers, it also acts as a convenient How To guide.) In The Spy's Guide, readers learn how to booby-trap their briefcase (because so many of us use those anymore...), monitor co-worker's hours, read a competitor's laptop and communicate with invisible inks. Good stuff, right?<br />My main issue with The Spy's Guide is that I got better advice watching reruns of Get Smart on Nick at Nite. Most of the tips given by the authors, retired CIA and KGB spies, are good only if you are seriously neurotic about the behavior of your co-workers or professional competitors, or have the extra time to spend following them around, sending anonymous emails and protecting your trash.<br />What makes The Spy's Guide an entertaining read though are the real life stories by the retired spies where they account instances of using the tips they impart in this book. Fortunately, these \\"Spies at Work\\" segments occur with regular frequency. (By the end of the book, these were the only sections I read, because frankly, I ain't looking through anyone's trash. And for people who want to look through mine? Have fun.)<br />One funny tip I enjoyed was going to a meeting where some negotiating will take place. Before entering, call yourself on one cell phone and when you answer, leave both phones on. Mid-way through negotiations, go to the bathroom, accidentally leaving one phone on the table with your notebook. While in the bathroom, listen on the other phone to what is occurring in the meeting in your absence. This could help you throw out the right salary, offer, etc.<br />Another fun tip was to conceal things in water bottles. The hidden object would be surrounded by water and a the bottled water's label. What makes this funny is that housewives have been doing this for years - hiding mad money in jars of beans with a cavity in the middle. Heck, in seventh and eighth grade my friends and I used to pass notes to each other concealed in pens, instead of having in k in the pen. What teacher could fault you for borrowing a pen when you ink ran out?<br />Is The Spy's Guide to Office Espionage worth your time to read? Probably not. Is it a funny gift to give to someone else? Definitely. It's best use though is to have it lying around the office. I told my boss what I was reviewing and you should have seen the look on his face!e the only sections I read, because frankly, I ain't looking through anyone's trash.

I don't believe in fate or astrology, but I do think that life is a journey and we don't have the tools for that journey at birth - we earn them. It's like school. First grade prepares you for second, which prepares you for third, and so on.<br />The Namesake, by Pulitzer Prize winning author Jhumpa Lahiri, is about the Ganguli family and the journey of that family as one unit and about some of their individual journeys. Ashoke comes to the United States to make a life for himself and eventually returns to India to marry Ashima and bring her back home with him. The reader is not shown much of Ashoke's transition into American culture, but we see every painful detail of Ashima's. Coming straight from India, she does not have all the tools to cope with life here. Gradually though, her experiences prepare her. Her children make that transition much more smoothly.<br />Early on in Lahiri's tale, Ashoke is in a train accident. He survives with only a limp, but his car-mates all die. When Ashoke and Ashima have their son, they name him after one of the men who died in the car - Gogol. The naming of something, be it a person or an object, is a powerful moment. Gogol's parents name him because they know that the train accident played a pivotal moment in their life. Gogol takes more than 30 years to understand that lesson. It takes those 30 years before he accrues the life experiences that leave him ready for that information.<br />Lahiri is a beautiful storyteller and the book is an easy read. She transitions from character to character but the reader never loses touch of the central story of one family - of family in general. There are two lessons Lahiri gives. First, as time moves on, so do peoples' lives. In each moment something new is learned and that lesson can be applied later. No moment is meaningless. Second, family is necessary, though not necessarily in the biological sense. We need family for support, for love and for a foundation. It is family who knew us when and will know when we change, grow, excel, decline. When we don't have family surrounding us, we can make our own up of friends, lovers and neighbors.ological sense.

You can select from actors in film and television, people in sports and characters in book and comic books. It's not that hard right?<br />Okay, so I have another challenge for you. Do the same thing, only this time list only females.<br />Still thinking?<br />Still?<br />Can you even come up with ten? Don't feel bad if you can't. Feel pissed off. Feel short-changed. Ask one question: Why?<br />It's only been in the fairly recent past that women have started to make an appearance in pop-culture in such a way so as to present examples of strength, combined with wit and, on occasion, super powers. Girls Who Bite Back: Witches, Mutants, Slayers and Freaks, edited by Emily Pohl-Weary, is a collection of essays, both prose and drawings, all dedicated to girls who choose to fight back. There are some essays focusing on the more obvious characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (giving Willow due props as well) and Xena: Warrior Princess. More interesting are the historical entries that explain how these kick ass women came to be and the characters that preceded them. Several pieces are fictional and create brand new fighting women, or give readers instructions on how to become one themselves.<br />Some readers of Girls Who Bite Back: Witches, Mutants, Slayers and Freaks will be overwhelmed by the science fiction, the comic book references and the overwhelming amount of attention given to Buffy, but fear not, the book offers some for all. And the section not of your element are written in such a way that even those ignorant of vampire slayers will be able to confidently read about Buffy and maybe even check out her show. You may not run out to buy your first comic, but you will feel new wonder towards Wonder Woman and some general irritation at the metamorphosis she has made in her lifetime from plain old Super Hero to sex-icon Super Hero.<br />In a total of 36 entries, women are given their due and readers are given an inspiration to either 1) support the few examples that currently exist in the media, 2) create new sheroes in the media and / or 3) become sheroes on their own to inspire women everywhere.ir due and readers are given an inspiration to either 1) support the few examples that currently exist in the media, 2) create new sheroes in the media and / or 3) become sheroes on their own to inspire women everywhere.	2004-07-18

Dinner is in an hour but your stomach is rumbling away so you nibble on a cookie, chow on a candy bar, suck on a ring-pop. The food might not be the greatest and a couple hours later you've probably forgotten you had it. But it did the trick. It took care of your hunger for the moment.<br />James Patterson and Andrew Cross's new book Jester is little more than the bag of nuts you get on an airplane to keep you going until your next layover or until you reach your destination. You wish your flight had a meal served on it, but are happy to at least have the snack.<br />Jester is an exciting tale of love, wars against royalty and quests for religious relics. While the tale briefly begins in present time, the true story begins in 1050 A.D. when Hugh De Luc watches people head off on crusades. He holds himself back from partaking in the religious battles at first, but when a second opportunity arouses, he is unable to keep himself from going to war. He leaves his wife Sophie at home and fights for the freedom he feels is right.<br />When Hugh returns home he finds that his decision to join the crusades has affected his whole villages and his wife, who has been taken captive. Going on about the plot might actually make the book seem less appealing and more dime-store-romance-novel-ish... But essentially that's what it is, with only a fraction of the smut.<br />Patterson and Cross do a very good job of writing an entertaining story that keeps you turnings the pages. With no less than 153 chapters in only 452 pages, Jester is broken up into bite-size chunks easily accessible to anyone. The book is flawed: while the book begins in the present, we never return to the beginning characters but instead end still in the time of the crusades; the plot is much too predictable.<br />When you want a nice easy read though, perhaps on a long flight where you just want to be distracted from the crying babies behind you and the coughing passenger besides you until your next layover or until you reach your destination, open the Jester. You might not remember much about the book when you're finished, but you will enjoy the read.ng passenger besides you until your next layover or until you reach your destination, open the Jester.

Lo Mein: Like Crime and Punishment, but with more crime, less punishment and the untimely death of Mickey Mouse.<br />There are certain types of entertainment that seem to revel in the bizarre, sick and twisted. Surely Lo Mein, a new novel by Robert Eringer, falls into this category.<br />Lo Mein seems reminiscent of the movie Very Bad Things, which starred Cameron Diaz and Christian Slater. In the movie, people are killed without regard to the death's role in the plot, with each gruesome death played up as supposedly &quot;funny.&quot;<br />In this same vein of humor lies Lo Mein.<br />Willard Stukey is an artist who has never sold a single painting. Making comparisons between himself and van Gogh, who also never sold any paintings during his lifetime, only soothes his discontent for a short time.<br />Stukey plots his way to fame with the theory that it would be better to be famous behind bars than to never be famous at all. He purchases a gun and goes to Disney World, where he plans to murder many people, as this will surely attract the recognition he needs.<br />Upon arriving in Disney World, Stukey goes to the rides with the longest lines, but decides that a murder based only on the amount of people present is not inspired enough. Instead, he waits until the parade goes down Main Street before he lets loose a shower of bullets and then flees to Kentucky.<br />Mickey and Minnie Mouse lie among the dead, and the &quot;Mickey Murder Manhunt,&quot; as the story comes to be known on CNN, is the leading story of the day. However, newscasters report that Stukey is a failed artist on the run from authorities. Stukey thus calls in and says that if the station doesn't refer to him as a successful artist, he will go on another killing rampage- first with Donald Duck and then with a multitude of other Disney characters.<br />As can be expected, Disney chief Michael Eisner is not pleased with the death toll mounting at his amusement parks, and he calls his own personal investigator, Jef Dalkin, onto the case. Dalkin looks exactly like Bruce Willis and suffers from Tourette Syndrome. This combination gets Dalkin in trouble repeatedly and lands Willis' name in the tabloids more than once.<br />The whole Tourette Syndrome subplot is supposed to be funny, but frankly, it's not - it comes off as a weak ploy to get laughs rather than an attempt at well-developed jokes or legitimate humor.<br />Still, the deaths in Disney World do have a twinge of twisted humor; the murder spree exacts the ultimate revenge on the Disneyfication of the world.<br />If any greater lesson is to be derived from Lo Mein (and that seems unlikely), it's Eringer's denouncement of the irrational litigation rampant in American society compiled with the large amounts of power in the hands of such entities as Walt Disney and CNN.<br />Otherwise, the book only offers some very bad artists doing very bad things.stigator, Jef Dalkin, onto the case.

When I go to a restaurant, I always order the same thing. After all, if I know one thing is good, why try something else? Surprise parties? I hate them - they scare the crap out of me. Plot twists in movies? I think they're so rarely done well, they only annoy me.<br />So when I saw Paulo Coehlo's new book, Eleven Minutes, on the bookshelf, I knew I had to get it. After all, I adored the other book I had read by him, The Alchemist. I reveled in the idea of curling up on my couch with an old friend - how I equate reading books by authors I like.<br />Eleven Minutes is a book about sex. You can cut it other ways, but that's what it comes down to. The title itself refers to the length of time it takes to commit the act. The world we live in revolves around sex, no matter how much people try to disguise or argue that fact. Rather than dispute it or make sex ugly, Coehlo presents sex as a beautiful lesson to be mastered as one gains experience.<br />Maria is a prostitute from a small town in Brazil who gets convinced to move to Geneva, Switzerland, to become a stage sensation. Doing Brazilian dances at a sleazy bar does not bring the fame Maria wishes so she gets out of her contract and tries to fend for herself in Geneva. With no money and little knowledge of the language though, she ends up working as a prostitute.<br />While Maria's entrance into prostitution is probably pretty typical, she is not who one imagines when they think of a sex worker. She visits the library religiously and during downtimes at her workplace, she reads and takes notes on matters of psychiatry, love, sex and farm management. She learns to provide for her clients physical and mental needs. She saves her money and she has adventures while she bides her time until her return home to Brazil.<br />Coehlo makes an astute choice in having the main character in his book, which honors sex, be a prostitute. Through Maria we are able to see some of the ugliest sides of sex. But it is through her development as a character that we are able to appreciate the beauty of the act of sex.<br />In his celebration of sex and love, Coehlo is a success. Sadly though, in Eleven Minutes, Coehlo is a victim of his own style. In The Alchemist, a book worth anyone's time, he tells a good story that has a tendency at points to become preachy, but the story itself wins out and the novel is excellent. In Eleven Minutes, Coehlo seems unable to resist his tendency to preach and much of the book becomes his opinion - his take on how things are and should be.<br />I read the book Eleven Minutes quickly - I ate it up and when I had to take a break, I couldn't wait to start reading again.

All said and done, though, I would rather curl up on my couch with The Alchemist, as it's a much more loyal friend.	2004-06-16

I'm generally a happy person, but when I'm not, I don't feel empowered to share that. In books, on television, in the movies - people experience bad luck and bad times but in the end they almost always conquer all. But real life isn't books, TV or the movies. We don't always get the Hollywood ending.<br />In Well, Matthew McIntosh writes about human experiences that aren't glamorous and they aren't always happy. Instead, McIntosh grabs onto the little sparks in people lives that help them keep going on.<br />It's fascinating to me when an author can write a book with characters in it that I wholly relate to, regardless of whether they are like me. When I was younger it happened frequently, but when I was younger all I needed was a character that liked to read, collected mundane things or worried about school and friends. Well struck a nerve in me that has been left untouched since childhood. McIntosh writes of the mundane happenings in life, the ugly little things that most people never mention but which we all know happen, and because of that, he has created a wonderful collection of stories.<br />McIntosh certainly isn't the first author to write about everyday life. While what he does isn't new, it does cover new territory. Well reads like a book of short stories. There are small segments dedicated to different people's lives, woven together with fines threads that are only visible on close inspection. The people's lives are in many respects hopeless, but they persevere. McIntosh never offers a succinct reason for why they continue trying, but he does suggest one image - that of a well.<br />What McIntosh seems to suggest is that everyone has a hole that they are trying to fill. If everyone has that same hole, regardless of whether it is spoken of, we share something in common. In that is the empowerment to share the negative aspects of life, the solace in knowing that others are experiencing what you are - what I am.<br />Well is an easy-to-read book. Each vignette lasts only a few pages and then you are on to the next person, the next life. Despite this brevity, characters are very real and their experiences stick with you. While no one scene may remain with you, the idea that people all share the common experience of bad times and the desire to find better ones will marinate in your head long after you put the book down.ing what you are - what I am. <br />Well is an easy-to-read book.

He loves reading historical novels and learning about the past. One year over the holidays my three siblings and I, without any planning or discussion amongst us, all purchased him gifts of books or videos on World War II. I think he finally reached the point of being overwhelmed by historical information.<br />I've read several of my father's books, but have never been able to embrace history the way he does. I do like it though when a book is able to take a historical event and feed it to you in such a way that you get to read a compelling story and not the dry history of schooldays. I like to get lost in the story, but finish the book feeling smarter about the past. While I don't gobble up history the way my father does, I think that he is smart to learn about what has happened before us so he can better understand our present and future.<br />In The Crazed, by Ha Jin, we are introduced to a communist China of the 1980s. What is presented as a mystery that unravels through the delusional rants of a sick old man is actually a statement on the political atmosphere of China for intellectuals during the late 80s.<br />The Crazed follows Jian Wan and his relationship with his teacher, Professor Yang. Jian is engaged to Professor Wan's daughter, Meimei, so when the professor suffers a stroke he feels doubly obligated to care for his teacher. During long hospital visits where Professor Wang speaks at length in the form of poems, unintelligible chatter and memories seemingly long lost, Jian starts to piece together a past to his professor's life that neither he, nor the professor's daughter, was ever aware of. He also gets insight into the life of an academic - a life that Jian is in the process of pursuing himself.<br />While the mystery of Professor Wang's life unfolds, in the background of the story always lurks the political climate of the area. If Jian passes his exams and is able to go on to study for his PhD, he will get to move to Beijing and be near his fianc&eacute;, Meimei. In Beijing there are student demonstrations occurring to protest the government. Through their letters back and forth, Jian and Meimei share their feelings on the protests. Jian's roommates also discuss with him their points of view on what is going on in the city.<br />Both the storyline about Professor Wang and that of the politics of China collide when Jian finds himself in Beijing. And then, in a very subtle way, Ha Jin is able to introduce his reader to a perspective on the Beijing student protests that might be new. While his reader is engrossed in his compelling story, he pulls out the great surprise of teaching a little history.ijing and be near his fiancé, Meimei.

The themes are dark, but the writing is light and airy.<br />The book begins in Friendship, Wis. shortly after the Civil War, where a deadly epidemic ravages the city, leaving few survivors. Jacob Hanson is the small town's undertaker, deacon and sheriff, each position tying him more closely to the town. So when the town starts to die away, he finds himself struggling to keep it together among people whose worlds are so out of control.<br />The town must be quarantined, so Hanson the sheriff must make sure the roads are blocked - no one can enter and no one can leave. Hanson the deacon must preach to his flock and ensure they do not lose faith. Finally, Hanson the undertaker has what is possibly the most important job: it is up to him to see that the growing list of the dying get a proper burial.<br />It is the last job that gives Hanson so much trouble. With the disease constantly spreading, the town doctor advises Hanson not to drain the bodies before he buries them. But he wants to give them a proper burial and respect the dead, so each body is drained. And with each draining, Hanson makes himself even more of a carrier of the deadly sickness.<br />At the time of the epidemic, the religious cult called the Holy Light Colony resides in Friendship. One of their followers is the first to contract the disease; the way the group reacts to death sharply contrasts with the rest of the town.<br />O'Nan tells a beautiful story, despite its sick themes. The story is disturbing, though. Hanson unearths his newly buried daughter and treats her as if she's still living; he also makes love to his deceased wife and converses with both these dead family members often.<br />Whether or not a person can be wholly good in desperate times seems to be the question O'Nan is trying to answer, but his conclusion is vague. Each person gets a proper burial... but then there is the necrophelia issue.<br />The best and most unusual part about A Prayer for the Dying is the way in which it is written. You are Hanson. The book speaks to you and tells you what is happening and how you react.<br />A Prayer for the Dying is a book worth reading with the right mindset. Although it is disturbing, the writing makes it worthwhile.s the necrophelia issue.<br />The best and most unusual part about A Prayer for the Dying is the way in which it is written. You are Hanson.

In a break from this natural order, Peter Sheridan's memoir, 44 Dublin Made Me turns to the bond of a boy with his father for its compelling tale.<br />Sheridan writes about his childhood with grace and ease. Readers are catapulted into his large Irish family in 1959 from the first sentence onward.<br />Peter Sheridan is a good Irish boy who enjoys school and loves the hectic life Dublin offers. His best friend, Andy, hates school but loves traipsing around the city in search of fortune.<br />The two boys influence each other in both good and bad ways - Andy gets involved with the church after a stint in reform school, and Peter learns to stand up for himself. In the end though, Andy remains the rogue and Peter the goody-two-shoes.<br />A steady presence throughout the book is Peter's Da. The man has his own outhouse in the garage, preaches to his family like they are his disciples and relies on his wins at the horse races as a major means of income.<br />Peter is his Da's helper and is ordered to do just about every imaginable task - from climbing up an ariel on the roof to fix the TV's reception to digging holes in the garage to fix water pressure.<br />When Peter's brother, Frankie, falls ill, their Da finds himself unable to cope. Peter tries to fill in for his father and be someone for his mother to rely on. After his father regains his strength, he and Peter find their friendship stronger.<br />Peter also runs errands all over the city and helps out with the tenants his parents have taken in.<br />One of these boarders, Mossie, plays a crucial role in Peter's life. Mossie robs Peter of his innocence, terrifies and scars him so deeply that Peter withdraws inwardly. Unable to find comfort, Peter then seeks solace at the hands of the church.<br />Illness and deaths make Peter grow up quickly and 44 Dublin Made Me documents his maturation.

Each story is more delicate and complex than the one before - beautiful on its own, but when joined with the rest, art.<br />The first story begins with a mother taking her children away to the country, fleeing her modern life full of unnecessary objects. The next story continues the narrative, watching as the mother holds her daughters captive in a small village while she goes on long walks.

But he saw nothing but misery and monotony in a life with only one person. Still, he knows his life, now controlled by alcohol, is not what he wants it to be.<br />The title story is extremely complex and vague, yet the main character's feelings jump off the page. A woman is reflecting on her childhood with her sister, born with developmental problems. Her parents could not love the sister in the way she needed to be loved, but their grandmother had that capacity. While the sister could not speak like other children her age, and sometimes did seemingly inappropriate things, she had the ability to love.

And why not turn to the people who create the steamy affairs that have kept lonely people turning moist pages for years?<br />That's right - romance novels.<br />Katherine O'Neil's **My One and Only** is a typical romance novel, complete with the not-so-hot guy on the cover. What other literature genre could inspire \\"lust in the loins\\" of the main characters by page 21?<br />Lust, apparently, is not the only thing to pop up early in the book. Observe:<br />\\"As his fingers toyed with her, lust rendered her insensible. Her breath scorched her throat, sounding tumultuous in her ears. Sweet longing gripped her, making her burn with a fever she'd never known.\\"<br />And doesn't everyone burn with a fever when meeting someone for the first time?<br />The plot of this book, as with most romance novels, does not need to be summarized. Why bother? O'Neal writes about her characters' affair in the early 1900s. The two have reunited after being kidnapped as children. Now, by some fluke, both are cat burglars. Who cares?

And before you have a chance to turn the page, \\"Her scream ripped through the hangar.\\"<br />You guessed it: Fontaine's not a virgin anymore. And thank goodness, because without that sex, Fontaine never would have found herself in a \\"misty expanse of some higher consciousness.\\"<br />My One and Only has a few tips about how to excite the lover you already have:<br />1.

There were two end results: I started breathing better and was high on oxygen and I got more medication into me than normal and got high on that. Basically, I was high as a kite for an hour or two and then it wore off. But for that brief period of time, I was happy and did everything at warp speed and was lovin' life.<br />Lester Bangs, for those of you not familiar with him, was a rock critic who was lovin' life a lot of the time, but he wasn't being supplied with happy, legal drugs from his allergist. When you read his work, you don't have to be told, though he does tell you, that he often wrote under the influence of a myriad of things. Sometimes his reviews don't make a stitch of sense. Other times they are pure genius.<br />The bottom line is, if you consider yourself music savvy, you should know who Lester Bangs is. If you need an introduction to his work, Mainlines, Blood Feasts, and Bad Taste: A Lester Bangs Reader is a great place to get it. The reader is a collection of Bangs' writing, edited by friend John Morthland. Most of the reviews are written as Bangs must of spoke. In fact, I often found myself reading his work out loud because they sounded better than they read. He would write an accent - not in a Zore Neale Hurtson I-spell-out-dialect sort of way, but in a William Shakespeare rhyme-and-meter-are-everything sort of way. It's magic.<br />Some of the reviews in Mainlines, Blood Feasts, and Bad Taste: A Lester Bangs Reader are tedious and near impossible to get through. He often refers to music that is most likely inaccessible to you, because, let's be frank, the man was a music snob. Snobbery or no, he knew his stuff and his developed completely original creative ways to write reviews.<br />Bangs loved life a little too hard and died of an overdose in 1982.

Through the course of the novel, Whitfield points out what's wrong with the numbers people see when they look at a scale.<br />Sonny, the main character, finds himself morphing from a trim man with a hard body to an obese, sweat-suit-wearing quasi-blimp after just one year dating Marsha, a woman who knows how to cook. The added 75 pounds in Sonny's life get him dumped by the woman he loves and dogged by the men who are supposedly his friends.<br />It is under these circumstances that Sonny finds himself in the meeting room of the FutraSystem Weight Loss Center. Here, he meets people who really understand how it feels to remember significant life events by recalling what he was eating at the time. He also meets Kayla, who admonishes Sonny for crying over a woman who would dump him over a few pounds.<br />Soon, Sonny finds that Marsha isn't the woman he's crying about anymore.<br />Dining on FutraSystem food packaged in yellow boxes with red labels, Sonny decides to get serious about his weight. He calls his friends and asks them for support, which they provide in the form of lots of workout equipment and an exercise routine.<br />Through Kayla, Sonny begins to question why he is losing weight. He realizes that he needs to lose weight for himself - not for Marsha.<br />In showing Sonny's struggle with weight loss, Whitfield presents his readers with a realistic story. Not so believable, however, is the relationship that forms between Kayla and Sonny.<br />The two lovers share much in common with regards to obesity.

Dr. Reed enters and is greeted with a kiss by his doting wife.<br />If Danielle Crittenden has her way, women will soon begin to revert back to the days of Donna Reed. She does not seem to understand that today's Technicolor world has little room for the stifling ideals of the black-and-white, Daddy Knows Best '50s.<br />In What Our Mother's Didn't Tell Us, Crittenden makes good points on bad premises and her arguments crumble before she finishes them. Crittenden says women can obtain happiness in life if only they will shun the outdated concepts of feminism. She forgets, however, that many of the issues her \\"outdated\\" feminism was created to combat still exist.<br />Crittenden rattles off statistics like an evening news sportscaster: \\"Women may now work in any profession and expect to be paid the same as men. They may marry or not marry, divorce or not divorce, have sex or abstain, bear children or not, postpone or abort them - all without social stigma.\\" If only.<br />And herein lies Crittenden's downfall. She is wrong. Women make only 75 percent as much as men. When they don't marry, they aren't celebrated for enjoying single life but suspected of being lesbians and pitied for being old maids. Women who have too much sex are sluts and those who have none are prudes. When women abort their babies, they are most often greeted at the clinic by a swarm of angry protestors condemning them to hell.<br />But, according to Crittenden, \\"It's time to settle.\\"<br />Settling, in Crittenden's view, is getting married and having kids young, when a woman's body is able, and pursuing careers later, when a woman's life is able.<br />It would seem that settling is interchangeable with giving up, reverting back to the 1950s that Crittenden says women recall with \\"wistfulness.\\"<br />What Our Mother's Didn't tell Us is a fairly accurate portrayal of the modern-day, heterosexual who wants to be or is married and who has or wants kids. The author's commentary, though, is elitist and out of touch with reality.<br />She overlooks the financial situations of most women - situations that dictate their necessity for working outside the home. She condemns lesbianism and masturbation in the same breath and seems to loath alternate living situations for women that do not involve a man to protect and care for them.<br />The question Crittenden poses, and rightly so, is a good one. \\"Today women like me ... take for granted the professional respect [women used to crave], but we can no longer expect marriage, stability, and children when we want them. Who is the bigger loser?\\"<br />There might not be an answer; surely Crittenden does not offer a satisfying one.<br />Today's woman might find herself pulled between the seemingly opposing forces of work versus marriage and kids with happiness out of reach, but she has choices to make.

He has the good luck of meeting Merle Luskey, who needs a good hand to help him at his oil rigs and will pay him until he gets enough money to return to Boston.<br />What starts out as a predictable hard-luck story with a happy ending, quickly turns into a wild ride through Texas as Erwin (soon dubbed &quot;Harvard&quot; for his alma mater) and Merle have to save Merle's oil rigs from the bank.<br />The over-riding moral to Chocolate Lizards (and what good cowboy tale doesn't have a clearly-stated moral?) is that you need to work at reaching your goals and never give up on them; friends can be the most helpful tools you utilize along the way.<br />Merle, a big, lanky cowboy with huge boots, pushes Harvard to succeed in daunting tasks. He also gets him a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots, otherwise known as chocolate lizards. Merle sees that Harvard had been offered all kinds of talents and opportunities, but that he needs to stand up to his father and really give his all to being an actor.<br />In return, Harvard helps Merle trespass, con, spy and cheat his way into striking oil and saving his oil rig.<br />Thompson makes this modern western so unbelievably great by adding in weirdness all over the place. Merle makes for the strangest cowboy. He's not exactly the Duke.<br />Police chases end with helicopters chasing after Merle's pick-up. Secret spy cameras obtain expensive confirmation about the location of oil. Best of all, Tex-Ann, the tall, flamboyant exotic dancer from Dallas, proves to be an essential part of Merle and Harvard's quest to save the oil rig.<br />Don't worry though. The love is sappy, as real cowboys might get the girls, but tend not to be too suave.<br />Chocolate Lizards is an awesome read that flies by and tempts you to get some chocolate lizards of your own.s chasing after Merle's pick-up.

US	43493883	R1NE5Y69LXAI5L	0385323638	337263488	Pink Slip	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Book explores romance	Six feet, 175 pounds of sexy, synthetic male flesh topped with glamorous red hair - the only man in Lisa's life is the one her mother bought her.<br />In Rita Ciresi's Pink Slip, Lisa's mother tires of worrying about her single daughter and thus buys \\"Security Man,\\" a convincing-looking blow-up doll, to ride in the front seat of Lisa's car, to ensure that no one will attack the seemingly solitary woman.<br />\\"He looked just like Perry Como. I couldn't resist,\\" says mom; Lisa decides to toss Red Rover (the dummy's) out onto the side of the highway.<br />After a string of dead-end relationships and affairs, the only man who has any staying power in 25-year-old Lisa's life is her gay cousin, Dodie. After watching her cousin stride up the ladder of success on Wall Street and rack up one happy relationship after another, Lisa makes the move to the burbs to find her own money and love, in whichever order they happen upon her.<br />As an editor at a medical company, Lisa finds herself surrounded by waspy, gossipy females and very few available men. Eventually, though, she finds romance with her boss, Strauss, a fellow Italian. The pair trade Italian names and attempt to one-up each other with mom stories.<br />\\"My mother beats throw rugs - with a big wooden spoon - over the back porch railing to get the dust out.\\"<br />\\"My mother waxes the kitchen floor on her hands and knees.\\"<br />\\"Beats vacuuming the ceiling. Really. I kid you not. My mother vacuums the<br />ceiling.\\"<br />Strauss and Lisa's office affair reads like a steamy harlequin romance novel, complete with the office security guard who discovers their relationship. Strauss and Lisa sneak out during lunch hour for a quickie at his house, only to find the cleaning lady. They end up taking a romantic stroll through the woods, tracking muddy prints all over the office upon their return.<br />Dr. Peggy Shoenbarger, boss to both Lisa and Strauss, finds the muddy evidence - the standard chaos ensues.<br />Ciresi keeps her readers' interest with the love story in Pink Slip, with the proper dash of sex scenes thrown in as added incentive.<br />On the more serious side, Lisa's struggle with her mother and the constant memory of her deceased father are hauntingly believable. These family sentiments give the novel much of its charm. Glimpses into Lisa's Italian-Catholic family and Strauss' Italian-Jewish family give depth to the story, where there otherwise would be very little. A running subplot about Strauss' father's Holocaust experiences seems slightly out of place, but finally ties into the rest of the story in the last chapter.<br />The main problem with Pink Slip involves Ciresi's bold attempts to flesh out her gay characters. She tries, but fails. Dodie struggles with his own identity during the AIDS scare of the '80s. Dr. Shoenbarger, meanwhile, is merely laughable as a stereotypical lesbian.<br />Ironically, Lisa writes her own novel in Pink Slip - she admits her problem in character development is making her gay characters believable.<br />Perhaps Ciresi realized her own weakness.esi keeps her readers' interest with the love story in Pink Slip, with the proper dash of sex scenes thrown in as added incentive. <br />On the more serious side, Lisa's struggle with her mother and the constant memory of her deceased father are hauntingly believable.

He buries the \\"Shakespearean potatoes\\" under couch cushions, behind clocks, in cabinets and once, in a pinch, in his schoolmate's hat.<br />After reading Robinson's Peculiar Memories, it makes sense that this is Robinson's first book and that prior to this he wrote and directed movies. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his screenplay, The Killing Fields. Were Peculiar Memories a movie, surely it too would be up for an award because it is a compelling read from beginning to end, if for no other reason than that it is so peculiar.<br />Intermingled with a touching, albeit weird, story about a boy and his grandfather, is a story about a boy obsessed with porn, a girl he is beset with and parents constantly in the middle of a row.<br />Unfortunately for the sweeter parts of the story, it's the nastier parts that stick with you.<br />Thomas lives with his grandfather, Walter, and communicates with him mostly through Morse Code. Their conversations are mostly one-sided because Thomas' machine is the only one that receives, as well as sends, messages. It was Walter who taught Thomas Morse code, a skill he learned in World War I.<br />It was in WWI that Walter became ill through an unfortunate turn of events that ended with the top of his head being blown off.<br />Since his brains had been shot out of his head and shrapnel was embedded in his belly, one might think Walter would have died. But he managed to live for 17 days - because maggots ate away the rot in his body - until Germans found him. After moving Walter, the Germans performed an experimental procedure on him, shoving his brains back in his head and placing a metal plate on the top of his skull. This miraculously saved his life.<br />Back in the United States, Walter managed to live a fairly normal life, with his hair carefully combed to cover the shiny metal plate on his head. Soon though, the wounds in his belly lead to fast-spreading cancer, and with it, impending death.<br />With Walter so close to death, Thomas finds himself driven to find the key to the cabinet where the old man keeps his collection of pictures of naked women before his grandfather dies and the treasure is lost. Thomas glimpses the photos for a glorious instant and he starts to see what sicknesses Walter's war injury has spawned.<br />Walter, possessive of his porn, knows that Thomas has been prying and tells the boy that he is occupying himself with the wrong secret. It is with this revelation that the real adventure of The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman begins and the mysteries unfold.<br />Robinson writes with great description, maybe even too much at times. He creates a story that is a quick read but that ends a little too neatly. The love story that winds its way through Thomas' struggles at home is just a little too cute and not very believable.<br />Despite these things, The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman works because it is hard not to turn the page and see what sick thing Thomas does, finds or buries next.to live a fairly normal life, with his hair carefully combed to cover the shiny metal plate on his head.

All of the pieces have to exactly fit together or the whole thing will fall apart. Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a perfect fit.<br />Preacher Nathan Price takes his family into the jungles of the Belgian Congo in 1959 to bring Christianity to the Africans. Told through the eyes of his wife and daughters, the story becomes a complex web of events, which leads to the eventual redemption of the Price family, but not the father.<br />Heading for the jungle, the Price family takes its version of life's necessities, like instant cakes and sewing shears. The Congo unravels the Price's perfect plan and family members have to reconstruct their lives around the rules of Kilanga, the village where they live.<br />Kingsolver crafts a careful story and shifts easily from the narration of Orleanna Price to her daughters. Rachel is the oldest and is consumed more with herself than with any problem that might occur in her family or in the village. Next in line are her two twin sisters, Leah and Adah. Leah is the adventurous tomboy and Adah is a bookworm and near-mute who has been crippled since birth. The youngest daughter is Ruth May, and her preciously innocent acceptance of the Congo provides a dear point of view about the country.<br />Especially funny is the take each of the Price woman has on her father. It is with a dark comic edge that the daughters recount the woes Nathan Price experiences trying to spread the Lord's word.<br />First Price, who does not speak Kilanga's native tongue of Kikongo, tries to baptize the village's children in the river. Years before, an alligator ate a child in the river and the villagers are sure that Price plans to have their children eaten. Price pathetically attempts to learn the people's language, but pronounces the words wrong so that the meaning of everything he tries to say dramatically becomes altered. When Price tries to praise Jesus and says Jesus is the savior, he pronounces the Kikongo word incorrectly and says Jesus is poisonwood, a plant that grows in the Congo and causes itching. Naturally, the villagers don't feel too crazy about Price's Jesus.<br />Kingsolver describes the Congo with such clarity that it becomes a living and breathing character of The Poisonwood Bible. The colors and the smells become integral parts of the story. She describes villagers with frankness and celebrates their differences from Americans without making their ways of life seem inferior.<br />Also an integral part of The Poisonwood Bible is African politics during the '60s. Without overwhelming the story line, Kingsolver weaves the dramatic political turmoil of the Congo into the plot so that it is easily understood.<br />As with finishing a suit, the end of a book can destroy a story. A careful hem can keep a fabric from coming undone, and stories need equally careful craftsmanship. Kingsolver adeptly avoids this problem by ending the story naturally and neatly tying up loose ends.onounces the Kikongo word incorrectly and says Jesus is poisonwood, a plant that grows in the Congo and causes itching.

Has your mind conjured up any images? Mine has - a boy of about 17 who spends all his time in his bedroom. He's never had a date and his translucent skin is evidence to the fact that he hasn't seen the sun in weeks. He is who I imagine reads science fiction books.<br />Two books: Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood and The Sheep Look Up by John Brunner. Each has common themes, similar punctuation quirks and they both fall into the genre of science fiction. What then makes the one book most accessible to the pale teenaged boy in his bedroom while the other inviting to the girl lying out in the sun?<br />The Sheep Look Up was originally published in 1972. A new edition begins with a foreword by David Brin in which he congratulates Brunner on writing a plausible foretelling of the future in which we have utterly destroyed the environment. While the book may have seemed foreboding in 1972, some of the smaller details of the book have not held up over time.<br />Turning sci-fi upside down<br />Margaret Atwood manages to take the genre of science fiction and turn it on its head, again. As she did so well in The Handmaid's Tale, in Oryx and Crake she takes a current social issue and pushes it to its extreme conclusion. In this case she looks at genetic engineering of species, from animals to people, and makes dire predictions about such experimentation.<br />Skipping through time, Oryx and Crake is a love story, a drama and, yes, science fiction. Told through the eyes of Snowman, we are introduced to a world where animals are being specially bred, science is king and the \\"smartest\\" people are living in protected areas while the rest of the world deteriorates. Snowman's best friend Crake is frighteningly smart, getting into the best schools and the best jobs and taking human genetics to new places. Post-college Snowman visits Crake to find him trying to perfect the human form. Oryx plays Eve to Snowman and Crake's Adam, tempting them both and embodying the fall of Crake's plans for perfection.<br />Most discussions of human genetics seem to center on morality versus perfecting flaws in genetics. Atwood suggests a different duality: utopia versus destruction. Using believable characters and dark humor, she keeps the reader engaged and makes science fiction more tangible.<br />What makes what Atwood does so unique is that she comes from a liberal, feminist slant. She creates compelling characters and the world she invents is so out there it's plausible. The Sheep Look Up actually confronts many of the same issues in the same way as Atwood does, which is impressive given the span of time between the two books. What makes Oryx and Crake a better read is that Atwood leaves out details that will date her book in later years, this making it more timeless, and her female characters have more depth, which makes it a more inviting read for more people.ng the fall of Crake's plans for perfection.<BR>Most discussions of human genetics seem to center on morality versus perfecting flaws in genetics.

He wants to assure him that he's OK.<br />This mission is the focus of Brady Udall's The Miracle of Edgar Mint. The author's inspiration to write Edgar's story developed from something much less painful than having his head run over, although possibly equally as dramatic.<br />The peculiar story that gave Udall the framework to work was sparked when his then girlfriend, now wife, revealed she was dating another man. She told him about the other man and how as a child he'd been run over by a mailman. Udall actively sought this man out.<br />&quot;He thought I was going to beat him up,&quot; Udall says.<br />But he was too interested in his history to hurt him. The other man's story was the inspiration for Edgar's.<br />The Miracle of Edgar Mint is Udall's first novel, although he has written many short stories.<br />&quot;The hard part is getting the confidence and figuring it out.&quot; Udall says. &quot;It's a huge investment of time and energy. This book took three and a half years.&quot;<br />That time was spent shaping and perfecting the story of a young boy facing hardships that most would find daunting, yet he perseveres. Run over at 7, Edgar spends months in a hospital until he's sent to live with an uncle he's never met on an Indian reservation and goes to a school where he's tormented daily by classmates. Edgar manages to flee the school to the home of a Mormon family willing to take him in, but his problems continue.<br />Udall wrote the story in first and third person in part because Edgar's story is so unusual and also because it's a grown Edgar telling us the story of his childhood.<br />&quot;Edgar is a character in his own story,&quot; Udall says. &quot;He's aware he's a character in his own story.&quot;<br />This makes the jumps between reading Edgar's story from his own point of view or from an outside narrator as logical as the jumps between the settings of Edgar's life.<br />Although some of the locations in The Miracle of Edgar Mint were fictional, others, such as Edgar's school, were real places near where Udall grew up in Arizona. With so many settings for Edgar's experiences, Udall could have done extensive research to get each detail right. Although this is what he started to do, eventually he stopped researching at all.<br />&quot;Imagination with a few good details is enough, with the right attitude,&quot; Udall says. &quot;I like to have the freedom to make it the way I want.&quot;<br />In The Miracle of Edgar Mint, Udall let his imagination run rampant.<br />&quot;I grew up in a big stable Mormon family, the polar opposite of what Edgar grew up with,&quot; he says.<br />Edgar experiences more turmoil in 10 years than most people do in a lifetime. Still, Udall manages to show the humorous side of otherwise depressing circumstances.<br />An admirer of the writing of Mark Twain, Udall sees writing comedy as an ultimate achievement.<br />&quot;It's not easy to take depressing, bleak writing and inject it with humor,&quot; he says.<br />Not easy, perhaps, but that's exactly what he does. For instance, while recovering at the hospital, Edgar is surrounded by people in hopeless situations. And while sad, when he turns to a urinal puck for comfort, there's something darkly comedic about his deodorizing security blanket.<br />Lightening the mood in what could be a dark story is also Edgar's unabashed motivation to live. As the character himself says in reference to himself and the people he befriends during his hospital stay, &quot;We were broken and afflicted and maybe ... we could make ourselves whole again.&quot;<br />Edgar's mission to locate the mailman from his past seems to be the key to making himself whole. Udall tried to reflect in Edgar the motivation he saw in kids from troubled backgrounds.<br />&quot;I tried to place myself as a child.&quot; Udall says. &quot;I've talked to lots of children. They're not aware that there's an alternative. They don't believe they have a choice.&quot;<br />Unaware, perhaps, that he can do anything but carry on, Edgar keeps going, trying to make himself whole. In so doing, his story becomes an endearing one of survival.dren. They're not aware that there's an alternative.

Sweat drips from your every pore and your muscles ache from heat exhaustion. Nothing sounds more refreshing than a cool glass of ice water.<br />Similarly, the school year drags on. It is past the middle of the last quarter of the year, and exams and papers have piled up. And right now, nothing could be more enjoyable and refreshing than reading Galaxy Craze's By the Shore.<br />What makes By the Shore so enjoyable is not the writing, although it is good, and not the humor, although it is funny, but the story line, which is a dead-on portrayal of the life of a 12-year-old girl.<br />May lives with her mother, Lucy, and her younger brother, Eden, in a boarding school-turned-bed and breakfast in rural England. Lucy is distracted from motherhood by the men and friends in her life. Eden is too busy to notice because he lives in a make-believe world of fairies and elves. But May wants some attention from her mom.<br />May tells one friend that her parents are still married, but that her father lives in the city. She tries to be popular by buying new clothes and hair barrettes with furry fishes on them.<br />When an eligible bachelor author comes to stay in the bed and breakfast, lives are turned upside-down in a romance too sweet to be seen through any but the eyes of a child.<br />Rufus comes to Lucy's bed and breakfast to work on the book he is translating. His on-again, off-again girlfriend, Patricia, makes many visits because she is jealous that Lucy is seducing Rufus. Patricia is right to be worried, as she is soon out of the picture. May's father enters the scene and May watches as her parents quickly rekindle, then extinguish any romance that might have been left between them.<br />Fortunately, Rufus remains.<br />Amidst all the turmoil of her mother's love life, May tries to find her place at school and in her family. Patricia lies to the popular girls at May's school and says May knows the famous musician Jet Jones, and that he has even kissed her. Suddenly May finds herself invited to the most exclusive birthday party of year, but leaves her best friends behind in the process.<br />Not surprisingly, May discovers that popular girls are not all they seem, childhood fantasies about parents should remain fantasies and, most importantly, her father is a jerk.<br />As By the Shore unravels, what's left is two people in love, a family full of surprises and two friends who love each other enough to remain friends.<br />Aside from a glass of ice water, what could be more refreshing than that?ssed her.

The Testament, his most recent in paperback, meets all the basic requirements of his previous novels (legalese with tension), but it has a new twist that sets it apart from the rest.<br />Grisham attracted the attention of litigious America in 1992 with his first novel, A Time to Kill, the tale of a lawyer defending a black Vietnam war-hero who killed the men who raped his child. Since then, Grisham's lawyers have found themselves in different compelling plots that make for enjoyable reads without inundating the reader with any deeper meaning.<br />With The Testament, Grisham seems to have left his usually formulaic writing behind - here he creates a deeper, more involved story.<br />Troy Phelan is planning his last will and testament and wants to make sure that his good-for-nothing, money-grubbing children don't get their hands on a red cent of his 11-billion dollar fortune. He plans everything down to the most minute detail and then jumps off a balcony to his death.<br />When the will is finally read to his heirs, everyone is surprised to learn that every last penny is left to Rachel Lane, an unknown, illegitimate daughter of Phelan's, currently working as a missionary in a Brazilian jungle.<br />Josh Stafford and his law firm must ensure Phelan's last wishes are carried through - the first and most difficult task falls upon the shoulders of Nate O'Riley.<br />O'Riley has just finished a stay at a detox center, one of many such programs he has been through. Stafford and his partners decide that sending O'Riley to South America might be the best way to keep him away from the stresses of the law firm for just a little longer.<br />Herein lies the genius of The Testament: Almost the all rest of the book takes place in South America and not in law offices. There are running subplots about the other Phelan heirs and their schemes to undo their father's will, so that they can get what they feel to be their rightful share of the money, but these stories are hindrances to the main plot.<br />With the help of Jevy, an ex-Brazilian army-man who acts as a translator and guide, O'Riley enters the jungles of Brazil as an unprepared American. A suicide attempt, plane crash, boat wreck and bout of Dengue later, O'Riley finds himself more at peace with his life and rather well-acquainted with Lane, the famous Phelan heiress.<br />Rather than churning out a novel filled with his typically entertaining legal mumbo-jumbo, Grisham creates an adventure novel with The Testament, with both romance and a lesson to be learned at the end. Perhaps the greatest pleasure of the book is that the answer to everyone's problems lies not in the hands of a judge, but rather a missionary in South America who neither wants nor needs to be a billionaire. What she does in the end is definitely surprising.<br />There are still court scenes and lawyers galore, but in The Testament, Grisham has written a novel that is decidedly different from his others, and thus very satisfying.they can get what they feel to be their rightful share of the money, but these stories are hindrances to the main plot.<br />With the help of Jevy, an ex-Brazilian army-man who acts as a translator and guide, O'Riley enters the jungles of Brazil as an unprepared American.

Her book mixes theory and analysis, intermingled with refreshing stories of goodness.<br />The prevailing discovery Grace makes is that people who perform acts of kindness do so because of a great faith in the human spirit - people who trust and believe in other people.<br />The stories Brehony tells are all striking in that they describe amazing generosity. She tells of people who donate kidneys to casual friends, adopt four children with AIDS, start after-school programs for troubled youth, teach gang members how to bake so they can raise money... the list goes on.<br />What makes Grace stand apart from its similar predecessors (the Chicken Soup empire) is the editorializing between the stories. Brehony doesn't just present readers with an act of kindness - she also explains the intent behind the act. She interviewed the people she writes about and makes their story more complete, rather than just telling what they did. She supplies the motive as well as the action.<br />By using different theorists, poems and quotes as support, Brehony writes a well-rounded book. Though Grace includes many of her own personal stories, which take away slightly from the author's credibility, the main message shines through.<br />Brehony has discovered 13 steps she thinks will help anyone find ordinary grace in their own life: &quot;Wake up. Discover what you love. Be prepared for pain as well as joy. Start where you are. Simplify and scale down. Recognize the spiritual ties between people. Understand and celebrate the differences between people. Put belief into action. Find grace in small things. Build on your immediate, personal connections to others. Model good behavior.&quot;<br />She could add one more: Read this book.in small things. Build on your immediate, personal connections to others.

Not all things I think can be explained. For instance, for years I would eat only square hamburgers. (This went on through high school...) One day I ate a circle hamburger and it turns out, they taste just fine. I can't explain the initial aversion to circle hamburgers or why the quirk went away. It just was.<br />When I select books to read, the selection is usually based on little more than whim. I am a whore for good book covers. I prefer hardbacks to paperbacks because it's much more satisfying the first time you break the spine.<br />I decided to read My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult basically because the main characters in the book are two sisters named Kate and Anna. My younger sister's name is Anna and mine is Kate. Maybe I figured it was fate?<br />My Sister's Keeper is not a great book in the sense that it isn't a challenging read. It is not some scholarly book that will make you feel smarter for having read it. It reads much more like a John Grisham book with a fast pace and rotating narrators.<br />Kate was diagnosed in early childhood with a rare form of leukemia. She needs a transplant and no one in her family is a perfect match. Kate's doctor suggests that her parents could have another child and that the child could be a possible donor. Rather than leave Kate's future to chance, her parents work with a geneticist to give birth to a second daughter who will be an absolute perfect match for Kate.<br />Immediately after her birth, Anna donates her cord blood to Kate. Although originally intended to be the only donation, as Kate's illness progresses, Anna makes several other donations, which requires multiple surgeries.<br />Now, as Kate's life seems to be reaching its end, thirteen-year-old Anna is asked to donate a kidney. Rather than go along with the procedure, as she has in the past, she hired a lawyer. Anna sues for the rights to her own body so that her parents can no longer make medical decisions for her. If she wins her case and elects not to make the kidney donation, her sister will almost certainly die.<br />Picoult story raises questions that will challenge anyone. When does a person get the right to independently make medical decisions? Is it moral to create one child for the sole purpose of saving another? When does the pain of one person outweigh the risks to another?<br />While My Sister's Keeper does focus primarily on the story of Kate and Anna, Picoult keeps the readers interest by also giving voice to the girls' parents and brother, as well as the legal experts in the book. Picoult successfully presents an exciting book that reads quickly and easily and keeps the reader wanting more.er parents can no longer make medical decisions for her.

US	43493883	RRTS3T8LWFWA5	0385494246	654180128	Amsterdam: A Novel	Books	2	7	12	N	N	Amsterdam not prizeworthy	Motivational speaker Charles Tremendous Jones once said that you are the same today as you'll be in five years, except for two things: The people you meet and the books you read. Contrary to what the judges of England's 1998 top fiction award, the Booker Prize, might think, Ian McEwan's Amsterdam is not a book by which great men and women are made.<br />Full of exquisite detail and insight into the creative process of world-renowned pianist Clive Linley, Ian McEwan spends more time on description than he does making his carefully orchestrated plot seem real. Much attention is given to how Linley writes the musical theme for the upcoming millennium, but not to why he bothers to stay friends with someone he does not like.<br />Amsterdam is about two friends, Linley and Vernon Halliday, a newspaper editor. Both are former lovers of Molly Lane, a recently deceased socialite.<br />The two men meet another of the woman's former lovers, a politician named Julian Garmony, who the men equally despise. Halliday has a chance to expose Garmony in his newspaper, which Linley finds deplorable. Linley finds himself in his own moral dilemma with Halliday telling him what to do.<br />Obvious road signs along the way point to the novel's \\"surprise\\" ending. McEwan finishes his book as if rushed on deadline, hurting what could be an excellent story.<br />What seems to be missing is more exploration into the character of Molly Lane. The woman who brings all the (male) characters of the novel together is only described in relation to her lurid romantic affairs. We know how she was in bed and what her sleeping arrangements were with her husband, but little attention is given to her supposedly illustrious career with Vogue or why the woman has so many lovers.<br />The only other female character in the book is Garmony's wife, Rose. An entire chapter is dedicated to her, but should not be. McEwan seems to be trying to show that Rose is a good little woman at home. However, McEwan makes Rose a doctor, seemingly rising above gender stereotypes. It's a weak attempt at pleasing the male readers who might care.<br />Though Amsterdam strives to be a dark comedy, it falls flat with its lack of humor and weak plot-line. The only things that identifies the book as a comedy are the reviews that list it as such. Amsterdam's strong point seems to be that it reads quickly and is short, so at least it doesn't take too long to finish.a doctor, seemingly rising above gender stereotypes.

It continues the prestige the series has earned itself over the past 14 years. During Pride Week, when gay people will celebrate their sexuality, this book celebrates gay men through its honest writing.<br />Editors David Bergman and Karl Woelz organized the stories in alphabetical order, yet this seemingly objective manner of organization blends the stories together perfectly. Each piece seems to have been placed very intentionally to create a larger story.<br />2000 wastes no time dealing with important issues. David Vernon, with his short story \\"Arrival,\\" tells the story of Joe, a young man dying of AIDS who tries to break the news to his best friend from earlier in his life. The story is broken up into choppy segments with subheads, almost as if the story has (very) short chapters that help create its whole. By jumping between narratives, Vernon manages to study all aspects of his scenario.<br />\\"Erasing Sonny\\" confronts the notion of being publicly marked as gay when Sonny gets a tattoo from his sister's boyfriend. What is supposed to be a small drawing of Donald Duck holding a cigar becomes a tattoo of Donald Duck holding something more phallic. The tattoo covers the expanse of Sonny's back. His attempts to hide the tattoo from his family eventually fail, and his mother sends him to the doctor to get the picture removed - an early birthday gift. While the public display of sexuality gets removed, Sonny finds himself strangely attracted to his male doctor and is left with a more personal, permanent reminder of his own sexuality.<br />Craig T. McWhorter presents his take on absolute heartache with \\"Silent Protest.\\" He writes of the oft-ignored struggle that occurs when two people of the same sex raise a child together and then separate. The law is often not sympathetic to both sides of the story, and the biological parent is the only one given the right to raise the child. From the point of view of the weekend-only parent, \\"Silent Protest\\" delves into the emotions of a part-time dad and his distancing relationship with his daughter.<br />It is stories like these that make 2000 the excellent collection that it is. The stories explore old issues with new fervor, such as AIDS or coming out, but they also take closer look at newer issues, like parenting and the establishment of gay marriages in Europe.raise a child together and then separate.

Brendan O'Carroll must have had the luck of the wee people with him when he wrote The Mammy, a truly hilarious book.<br />O'Carroll, who acted in the film Angela's Ashes, wrote The Mammy as the first in an upcoming series of three. His debut novel hits its mark with every joke and captures the essence of working-class Ireland.<br />The series centers on a widowed mother, Agnes Browne, and her seven children, all living in Dublin, Ireland in the 1960s. Her youngest son, a toddler, speaks little but repeats every curse word he hears. Her oldest son tries to seduce girls with licorice and finds himself plagued by a number of puberty-related problems.<br />The Mammy opens with what could be a heartbreaking scene of loss and sorrow: the death of Browne's husband. But with apt amounts of Irish wit, O'Carroll turns the funeral scene into a hilarious escapade that leaves Browne cursing her late spouse.<br />The funeral parties get backed up entering the cemetery, so Browne loses track of which coffin belongs to her husband. Without realizing it, she follows the wrong body and is surprised when she sees another woman crying by the gravesite. Without a second's thought, Browne assumes the grieving woman is her late husband's mistress and mutters \\"'Yeh dirty bastard\\" under her breath.<br />Another comical scene ensues when Browne attacks a nun with a cucumber and ends up in court - all because of a pair of knickers. The tale itself is nearly as funny as when Browne has to explain it to the judge. Soon, her only daughter takes the stand and, with a little Irish luck, Browne wins the case.<br />In The Mammy, Agnes Browne becomes an every-woman, the ultimate mother and friend. She manages her children (a wild brood), helps her friend through cancer and handles her husband's death with grace. And through O'Carroll's imaginative writing, just about everything Browne does is funny.<br />In the end, the book itself becomes a little treasure lying at the end of an Irish rainbow.k itself becomes a little treasure lying at the end of an Irish rainbow.	2004-06-16
