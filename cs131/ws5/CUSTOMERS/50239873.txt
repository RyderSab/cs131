It was extremely difficult to read the writing is blunt and has no flow to it whatsoever. The characters are shallow (although this is probably because of the writing style) and the language is bad making the characters seem unintelligent.	2001-10-16

I read the reviews for 'Saving Faith' and decided not to read it.. for a long time. I disagree with the poor reviews. <br />Baldacci was bound to have a 'flop' because he set the bar so high with his previous books. Compared to most authors, 'Saving Faith' is still an exceptional read from an exceptional author.	2001-09-04

The use of bad language and violence runs fierce. <br />However... It's interesting enough to make you keep reading because a good manhunt makes for an interesting action tale.<br />I've now read most of Hunter's books and I am beginning to find a repetitive pattern towards his 'heroes' as they all look and act like John Wayne and love to commit adultery.	2001-07-09

The fact that he was a pot bellied 'nobody' made me cheer more for him. Too many lead characters have the same 'Rambo-like' mold so Leets made it interesting.<br />This story was about honour and duty.

I don't know why they compare Iles to Grisham, I don't think Grisham has enough action in his stories.<br />My only complaint is the trial.. I think this could have been settled better without it. <br />However, an excellent story by a new author.

I read 'Gone Baby Gone' and really didn't like either the story or the characters. <br />I thought I would try again (reading Lehane) as the storyline of 'Prayers for Rain' sounded good and with so many people liking LeHane thought it was worth another shot. <br />I thought 'Prayers' was excellent. Good villain, good characters, action, mystery, comedy and more. It kept me reading until the end. <br />I also like the way they rescued Angie's character from 'Gone Baby Gone' where I found her extremely shallow.	2001-05-28

My complaint about this story is that the ending failed to live up to the drama created as the story moved on.

I had to put this book down 3 times and read others in-between. The only reason I carried on was the fact that I had enjoyed 'Riptide' and 'Mount Dragon' so thought it would have to get better.

It took me 3 weeks to get through it and it's only 370 pages long. (I normally read 2-3 books a week) What kept me reading was the fact that both 'Amanda' and 'True Crime' did take a while to get into so I thought Corruption might at least finish with a bang.

I didn't like the main characters Kenzie and Gennaro. Kenzie seemed like too much of a follower (although he was tough with a gun--sarcasm) and Gennero wasn't a likeable love interest. This book did manage to pick up 3/4 into it but by then it was too late.	2001-04-10

I liked 'Last Coyote' the best so far. (I haven't read Void Moon, Angels Flight, or the Black Ice yet)<br />I liked it the most because it was a battle of the human spirit which was Harry's greatest test of all. It also had the most action which didn't hurt. <br />Last Coyote was an excellent book and I highly recommend it.	2000-12-27

The story had all the components  that make a Follett novel great but that may have been the problem, it did  seem like Follett was trying to force out another book as per contractual  obligations. Good but not great.	2000-09-15

Although I agree that the main character &quot;Lou Boldt&quot;  should be different than the prototypical 'cop on the edge' I think Pearson  took it too far. Boldt doesn't swear and drives a Volvo? I thought of my  nerdy neighbor!! I just couldn't relate nor feel for the title character.  Besides the fact that Boldt was/is a nerd the story itself is average at  best. I felt that this kind of story has been done several times over. Do  yourself a favour and read Baldacci, Follett, and DeMille.	2000-09-14

I looked forward to Quicksilver and if I hadn't of  read Icefire I would have given up on it. The first 200 pages could have  easily been shortened to 50 or so. I also didn't like the wimpy  peace-loving male character. Don't get me wrong, I didn't mind, at first in  this novel, the strong female characters, but it got a little much how they  both thought of him (Tom Chase) as &quot;thick&quot; and a  &quot;nuisance&quot;. It almost sounded like the husband and wife writing  team were communicating their frustrations about the other through the  novel.<br />The story, after the first 200 pages is however filled with action  and will keep you reading.<br />I will wait for reviews before reading another  of Reeves-Stevens novels.	2000-08-31

I will definately read more of his books.	2000-08-15

Word  of Honour is still my favourite followed by Plum Island and Gold Coast. One  thing about Demille that I like is that each of his books are different.  Talbot Odyssey is a 'spy' novel similar to Ludlum. Although it was a little  more off-beat than his other novels it was filled with action and heroic  efforts. The characters were interesting and the story kept you guessing  (and paranoid. I wish there were more DeMille novels to read because he's  spoiled me.	2000-08-12

It was like reading a 'Hunter' episode..it was sooo boring. This book lacked everything!  It had no  character development and was extremely predictable and unimaginative. I  don't like to be so harsh with a review but I cannot understand the  accolades.	2000-06-11

This made my  stomach turn and was as far as I was willing to go with this. It was just  too unbelievable..his wife wants to leave him because running for President  is too dangerous and his feminist girlfriend choses her career over a  child?	2000-06-11

Although I have now come to appreciate DeMille's books and am not scared off by the length but a story about Vietnam that also includes a trial seemed unlike  any of his previous books, needless to say the subject didn't interest me.  However, Word of Honour in my opinion is his best. You wonder what other  stories are there for Tyson when he was in Vietnam and his life now. If  you're a fan of Nelson DeMille you have to read this one!	2000-06-08

There seem to be a lot of people who didn't like Plum Island. What made Plum Island so enjoyable was the character of John Corey. In Lion's Game, John Corey seemed like a fish out  of water..DeMille should have done what he has done for his other novels  and used a different character. Lion's Game definately built up the  excitement but lacked the punch of a face-to-face. I felt cheated, I don't  want a sequel when a novel is already 677 pages long. (although it seemed  short) Lion's Game seemed too commercial and lacked the intelligence of  DeMille's previous works (Gold Coast, Plum Island).	2000-05-27
US	50239873	R26EMNMDTLBQ6	0446360856	38570142	The Gold Coast	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Disturbing	After reading Plumb Island and Cathedral I was expecting a different type of ending. I was waiting for the 'showdown' between Sutter and Bellarosa. This was a psychological showdown and not one of action. Very different. I  really related to the character of John Sutter and his wife. It was very  scary in fact, and as the last 150-200 pages of the story unfolded I became  quite disturbed how things were turning out between Sutter and Susan. This  book gave me a 'wallop' on the heart strings and will take a while to get  over it. This book was absolutely hilarious up until then but I couldn't  laugh anymore. I can't see a sequel here. I am very glad I read it though.	2000-05-05
