Pay heed to the earlier reviewers when they say the hints in this guide are often poorly considered. When they say that an NPC, spell, or item is useless, take it with a hefty grain of salt. In fact, the more vehemently they trash something, the more you should suspect that they are completely wrong. there are also mistakes and omissions. I know far more about BG2 than the authors of this book ever will. That said, I use this book frequently when I play BG2 because of the maps and list of item locations. I do not recommend using it this way as a beginner, but if you've played through the game more than 3 times and you want to know more about it, this is a good way to start. Internet newsgroup archives and web walkthroughs are usually far more thorough sources of information, however.	2002-01-16

It is well-written, and the art is excellent, as fans of Alex Ross should expect. That said, it is also a work with strong political motives. It actually says more about modern liberal thought than it does about anything else. Conservatives will be offended by this book, while liberals will enjoy it immensely. People without strong political opinion will be introduced to one side of the &quot;debate&quot; between the two groups that has never really been a debate at all, but a series of unfriendly attacks from both sides, where history is treated as clay to shape and skew any way one pleases and one's own mistakes are ignored by conspicuous denial while the mistakes of the other side are constantly pointed out and intensely analyzed.<br />The final messages of this book are that unquestioning patriotism is a counterproductive mockery, while hope is a strong positive force; past mistakes ignored are doomed to be repeated, while an understanding of past mistakes better prepares one for a more successful future. In my opinion, both of those messages are true. I do not agree that the author fully understands historic patterns, and I feel that his exposition of mistakes is highly selective although the mistakes themselves were true mistakes. This story must be taken with a grain of salt and a healthy portion of critical thought, not with blind acceptance at all. Nevertheless, his intent is good and his story is worth reading even by those who feel that neither side in today's great political insult-fest is entirely praiseworthy.	2001-07-25

This is an excellent book, in which the unique entertaining dialogue present in most of the Eddings' previous works carry the day. It is true that the characters and the plot are like every other good fantasy book written since Tolkien, but that is what I like. It is often overlooked that none of those previous books were original either. Sometimes nostalgia poisons a person's enjoyment of things, and I think that is where the bad reviews are coming from. Memory is perfect and surreal while reality is mundane.<br />The Belgariad was great. So were the Malloreon and Elenium. They all had the same tone and feel. This one does too, and I really enjoyed how the book flows. I think the Eddings had fun writing this one, and I know I had fun reading it.	2000-12-28

It has very thorough keys even to obscure groups, at least to family level and sometimes to species level! It is much more in-depth  than the simple &quot;Soil Biology Guide&quot; name implies. It was written  in 1990, so it is not yet out of date. Nearly 1300 pages of keys, habitat  info, etc!	2000-07-29

This book is excellent for understanding the &quot;theory&quot; of the Win 98 registry, but I have not found it very useful for guidance in the practical aspects of actually tweaking registry settings. It usually  contains enough information about a particular registry section to know if  it is not worth editing, but it often does not give enough coverage to  important keys. It would definitely benefit a lot from input by a person  who commonly solves problems using the registry. That said, I have  sometimes found it helpful when trying to find which key contains a given  piece of info that I am interested in tweaking.	2000-07-27

It certainly does not contain everything, but it does  contain a lot of valuable information. Despite the title, it should be  clear that it is for all Win 98 users, not just for Microsoft-haters. This  is one of three books that I keep handy for solving Windows problems. The  O'Reilly web site has samples (and corrections!) for this book, so check it  out if you are interested.

This is THE book for those who wish to identify wasps, sawflies, and related insects to family level. It is not yet outdated, and it contains highly reliable information for all of the superfamilies and families of  Hymenotpera then recognized. Each chapter is written by one of the foremost  experts of the group in question. The keys are among the best ever  designed, as they contain valuable comparative information presented in an  easy-to-read outline format. Almost every couplet in every key in the book  is accompanied by an appropriate diagram -- a rarity in most expert-level  identification references. An essential reference for Hymenoptera taxonomy.	2000-07-24

Capitalizing on the popularity of the JLA, DC at last managed to pull off a successful revival of the Justice Society, the first super-team in comics. Part of the credit also belongs to James Robinson, the author of  the excellent Starman series, and to the fact that the ugly continuity  problems that plagued many earlier attempts at revival have been sorted out  to a more or less stable, if not always satisfactory, degree. Robinson  settles the question of membership (over 20 potential members of the team  existed) by killing off several possible candidates, but I think the  members he chose are the best ones. The plots and characterization are  excellent, as usual for Robinson. It is best if you have some familiarity  with the characters, but at any rate, don't miss this series!	2000-07-24

This is the essential reference for those wishing to identify Chalcidoids (very common, tiny parasitic wasps) to generic level. All known genera present in North America are covered, and each key is designed by one of  the foremost experts of the family in question. Certain chapters are  unusually authoritative for works of this type because the authors examined  backlogged material in museums in order to make this reference as complete  as possible, which resulted in many taxonomic and nomenclatural changes.  Absolutely essential for identification of Nearctic Chalcidoids.	2000-07-24

He was a botanist of the old school, and his resentment of the new microbiological methods of studying Cyanobacteria is expressed here in an  entertaining diatribe. The drawings are great but not plentiful, and it may  not be very clear which conventional species that they refer to. Drouet  lumped most of the existing genera and species of Cyanobacteria together  because of his belief that most of the morphological variation in the group  was caused by environmental diversity and not by genetic diversity. This  belief was based on a series of unpublished experiments, which bred  criticism of his methods. Mainly good for historical purposes.	2000-07-24

This book was the most important identification reference for Pteromalidae in the Holarctic region up until recently, and is still the most authoritative reference in that region for species identification. It is  still the most reliable identification guide to European Pteromalidae, and  it is not likely to be replaced soon. The drawings are among the best  available, and the information is still relatively up-to-date for its time,  though it is recommended that students make sure the information they find  here is up to date by consulting more recent literature.	2000-07-24

This is the 1931 Geitler book on Cyanobacteria that was THE standard for identification of these organisms for 50-60 years. It is written entirely in German, and most or all of the other identification references that  appeared during that time were simply translations of this work. Recent  changes in classification due to the advent of microbiological methods have  rendered part of this work outdated, but it is still very useful if one  intends to attempt identification to the species level, or to make some  sense out of older cyanobacteriological literature. It may still be  considered up-to-date by those who approach cyanobacteriology from the  Botanical standpoint, but that approach is gradually going out of style for  bacteria studies.	2000-07-24

This was the fourth part of Drouet's revision of the Cyanobacteria. He was a botanist of the old school, and he lumped most of the existing genera and species together because he believed that most of the morphological  diversity in this group was due to different environmental conditions and  not to genetic diversity. This belief was based on unpublished data, so  most researchers, botanists included, ignored his work. Some great  drawings. May be of interest to researchers of this obscure group of  Cyanobacteria because it is one of the few studies comparing them.	2000-07-24

This book is based on the JLA's first encounter with the villains that ruled Earth 3 before the Crisis (which is related in the JLA Archives). It is not really different enough from those stories to count originality as  one of its strong points. It is very good as a Grant Morrison JLA story,  which I can't get enough of, and the art is excellent. All that can also be  said about the Morrison stories in the regular JLA series, which are a lot  more affordable. Not essential, but very good.	2000-07-24

Alan Moore is also the author of the more famous Watchmen maxi-series, but this series came first and it clearly foreshadows the ideas expressed in Watchmen. The plot is not quite as complex as that of Watchmen, but the  characterization is excellent. It is not long, consisting of a 10-book  maxi-series in comic-book format.

It expands on the Tarot theme found in the first volume (and also in the Tarot series). This book is one of Anthony's first from almost entirely the female point of view, and he does a good job overall. The action is great,  with many plot twists and tense moments. The problem is the epilogue, in  which Anthony conducts one of his typical experiments in the psychology of  sex. He equates friendship between females with sexual love in a way that  turned me off. If you can swallow this, you will love the book. If not, you  will be disgusted. If it were not for the epilogue, I would have given it 4  stars.	1999-04-13

The humor, honesty, cynicism, and perspective that Voltaire is noted for comes shining through in this excellent work. It is a series of articles on subjects  important to philosophers of Voltaire's time, such as religion, humanism,  and ethics.

Candide is one of my most favorite philosophical works because of the humor, honesty, and original perspective that Voltaire brings to this story. This translation is recommended because it also contains many other  excellent works from Voltaire, such as Zadig and Micromegas. The  translator's notes are very helpful, and in many cases shed light upon  Voltaire's intended meaning when the English is not able to convey  everything.	1999-04-07

If you like the complexity of the Wheel of Time series, you will like seeing the summarized information from the series  too. The art work does not capture the personality of the characters, and  sometimes it does not even reveal what sex they are very clearly. The  characters described as most beautiful or handsome come off looking no  better than those described as looking average. The faces have no  expressions, so that there is little to distinguish one drawing from  another. The maps are informative, and they are much better than trying to  draw them out for yourself using hints from the series. Only for a die-hard  Robert Jordan fan.	1999-01-13
