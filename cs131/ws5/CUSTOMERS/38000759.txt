Crikey, Harper Collins, Word puts all those little red and green lines under the mistakes so that you can FIX THEM. <br /> <br />This is the first Discworld book where there has been any sort of real focus on trolls and troll culture.  As Detritus's biggest fangirl, I was much with the glee.  I loved the \\"Two Brothers\\" and \\"Diamond\\" passages on the first few pages--they're the kinds of things that keep Discworld from turning into something like Xanth. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read WHERE'S MY COW?  I want to know what comes after the Hippopotomus. <br /> <br />Sybil is awesome.  Not that she hasn't always been awesome.  She's just especially awesome here. <br /> <br />I am beginning to get the impression that the Vimes-Ramkin family butler, Willikins, is on of Pratchett's new favorites.  He is one of the major peripheral characters in this book, building on the role he's taken in JINGO and NIGHT WATCH. <br /> <br />Yes, Vimes does hire a vampire.  A vampire named Sally.  I didn't really like Sally; shes like one of those characters that appears during the middle of your favorite TV shows and steals the spotlight.  Like Seven-Of-Nine.  Quite a lot like Seven, actually. <br /> <br />Vimes's new Dis-Organizer is a Gooseberry(tm) with an iHUM feature that lets him play 1,000 of his favorite songs.  Pratchett kills me. <br /> <br />Was glad to see Death here.  His absence over the last few books has been worrying. <br /> <br />Last thought: a big part of this story involves the mystery of a secret hidden in a painting, all revolving around a book called The Koom Valley Codex.  There are codes and mysteries and shadowy orders dedicated to keeping the secret from seeing daylight.  This is all so, so much more gripping than THE DAVINCI CODE.	2005-09-23

When ALTA and THE FAIRY GODMOTHER came out, though, I was interested enough to give them both a try. <br /> <br />FAIRY GODMOTHER is the story of Elena Klovis, who would have been her Kingdom's Cinderella but for a twist of fate.  She resolves herself to life as a maid, only to be recruited by one of the elusive, nearly omnipotent Fairy Godmothers (think Jedi with a magic wand instead of a lightsaber).  These \\"Fairy\\" Godmothers are mostly human women who dedicate their lives to the Tradition (the Force).  The Tradition is the driving force behind most things in the world of the Five Hundred Kingdoms.  It is raw magic, moving frequently on its own whim, and it affects everything from grand politics and weather to the lives of everyday people.  Elena's job is to learn how to manipulate the Tradition--to nudge things toward their happily ever after.  In her apprenticeship, Elena battles an Evil Sorceress (who turns out, really, to be a Misunderstood Sorceress), saves a princess from falling asleep for a hundred years only to give her a really, really bad hair day, and learns just how dumb unicorns really are. <br /> <br />While this is a relatively lighthearted book, Lackey doesn't gloss over the darker side of fairy tales, for which I am extremely grateful.  There is very real danger and unhappiness portrayed in this book, and the fact that sometimes there is no perfect happy ending.   <br /> <br />I suppose I'm still having some trouble with Lackey, though, in the form of her characterizations, which have really been suffering of late.  Elena is a relatively blank figure--more a vessel through which a story is told than a character herself.  Lackey uses Elena's thoughts whenever she needs a moment of exposition.  Alexander was a pain in the bum--he makes a relatively swift transition from being an irredeemable ass (literally.  Hah!  That was a funny part) to being Main Love Interest/Fairy Champion/God Warrior of Whatever.  Annoying in the extreme. <br /> <br />All in all, though, I hope that Lackey decides to write more stories set in this world...it's a pretty cool place.	2005-07-06

Leonard is a great artist (just check out his website, herbleonard.com, for more Tori Amos art, Kate Bush art, Peter Gabriel art, and loads more) and captures perfectly the spirit of Tori's music.  Each and every work in here is full of tiny details and brings visual clarity to Tori's beautiful chaos.  There were only a couple of works here that I disliked...namely, the illustrations for \\"Cornflake Girl\\" and \\"God\\"--in the \\"God\\" painting, it is very obvious that the artist took some not-so-great photos of Tori (from what looks like the MAXIMUM INTERVIEWS photo shoot) and translated them into paintings.  In the \\"Cornflake Girl\\" painting, the overally effect would have been a little less silly looking if he hadn't taken the work so very, very literally. <br /> <br />I thought that it was fantastic that so many of Tori's works were there (everything from Little Earthquakes to Venus Orbiting, including something like 95% of her B-sides, plus a few unreleased Ellen Amos songs and a few from Y KANT TORI READ--which is, incidentally, not a bad CD at all, and really should be more widely available.  Oh, well.  Go to hereinmyhead.com to hear some of those songs).  I do have a few gripes about the edition--this book is chock-full of typos and misprinted lyrics.  I have a first print copy of this book, so possibly these errors have been corrected in subsequent runs. <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

But this latest chapter in the Stubbs family saga left me a little cold. <br /> <br />Rickey and G-man are having a high old time at Liquor.  They're making great food, and great money too.  But when Liquor gets a terrible review, and \\"Daddy\\" (their benefactor, Lenny) gets into some contrived legal trouble with the sociopathic DA, Rickey and G decide they need to start forging out on their own.  Right on cue, a wealthy Texan named Firestone calls Rickey up and asks him to come out and do a bit of consulting work for the modest sum of ten thousand dollars.  Rickey will be working closely with Firestone's head chef...Cooper Stark! <br /> <br />Who, you ask?  Ah.  You're obviously not a Subterranean Press subscriber.  Coop is the has-been celebrity chef who tried to seduce Rickey during the fifteen minutes Rickey was at the CIA school.  Coop was kinda pathetic then, is really pathetic now. <br /> <br />But I didn't mind Coop.  Nor did I mind G-man striking up an instant, blood-brotherish friendship with a rap mogul over a conversation about baloney.  I didn't even mind the deux ex machina that saved Rickey's butt this time.  What I did mind was the plot device that phoned Rickey and G-man on page twenty to deliver a nice chunk of information for no apparent reason.  I minded the neverending exposition on the part of certain characters.  (I haven't decided yet whether I minded the Linda Getty cameo.  Early PZB fans will remember her from THE LAZARUS HEART and \\"Monday's Special.\\"  I hated TLH, but I was fond of the character, so it was kind of nice to see her there.)  I *really* minded the \\"DoctorB\\" exchange in the middle of the book.  Authorial insertions aren't cool in fanfic, and they aren't cool here.  Besides, after all those years on the oft-missed Phorum, Poppy should know what real trolls sound like.  And above all, I minded all the foie gras.  To read this, you would sometimes think that no one in the world ate anything BUT foie gras.  Foie gras hamburgers?  No. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to the next book, but PRIME just left a bad taste in my mouth.	2005-03-26

US	38000759	R3OR9D2W1BNYCJ	044100069X	150984734	Deerskin	Books	3	10	19	N	N	Beautiful, but NOT the fairy tale!	I read this as part of a bundle of retold fairy tales, and was insanely confused.  This book bears very, very little resemblence to its parent story, &quot;Donkeyskin,&quot; and thus, was very distracting to me.  I kept looking for parallels to the original story, and didn't find them.  The only part that followed, in fact, was the first section, where Lissar's mother dies, and her father declares his intention to marry his daughter.  When Lissar refuses, he rapes her and leaves her for dead.  The next morning, she flees the castle with the clothes on her back and her faithfun sighthound, Ash.<br />While I did love the made-up mythology, and the subplot-which-rapidly-became-the-plot about the dogs and the Moonwoman, the repetitive nature of the early parts of the book (&quot;Your mother was the most beautiful woman in the world&quot; repeated five or six times a page for about fifty pages) and Lissar's disconnectedness from the world around her following her assault drove me crazy.  Some numbness I would certainly expect from a survivor or a brutal rape, but her inner monologue became tedious in the extreme after a short while.  &quot;It is getting cold.  It is also getting dark.  White stuff is falling out of the sky.  What is the white stuff called?  Oh, it is called snow.  It is falling on this...stuff growing out of my head.  I think the word for the stuff that grows out of my head is hair.&quot;<br />Such a person, you'd think, would have lasted approximately ten minutes in the deep woods.  But no.  She suddenly morphs into an experienced woodswoman, all while maintaining this disconnected demeanor.<br />On the flip side, though, I do have to give McKinley kudos for...adjusting...some aspects of the original fairy tale that never made sense to me.  For example, in the original story, the unnamed Princess, now called Donkeyskin, escapes to the neighboring kingdom and proceeds to make the prince of that land fall madly in love with her.  I always though, &quot;What?  How many friggin' princesses can there BE in a 50 mile radius?  Why doesn't he recognize her?&quot;  McKinley handles this by disguising Lissar--AND her dog--so that no one can tell where they came from.<br />Despite the lyrical, haunting prose, I got the feeling that McKinley tried to be daring by pickig one of the more gruesome fairy tales out there to retell, but then wimped out before going the full monty and telling the full story of the sun, the moon, the stars, and, of course, the donkeyskin.	2004-01-11

Newford feels like a real place, no matter where you live.  It reminds me of Vancouver, Philly, and Portland--three of my favorite cities, all rolled into one.  There's grit and decay and parks like little oases.  There's rain and snow and bright sunny days.  There are Birkenstocks and combat boots and nicely pressed suits.  In short, there's everything, and then some.  And then, every so often, de Lint takes us to a quieter place, like the desert or the countryside...it's like really &quot;getting out of the city&quot; and going on vacation.<br />2. THE CHARACTERS.  De Lint is famous for his brilliant characters--a constantly shifting, yet interconnected cast of artists, singers, and other assorted dreamers.  There are animal people, an Oak Princess, a mediaeval sorcerer, and half-faerie, and an angel.  And they all seem like the same sort of people that you might bump into on any street corner on ny given day.  The overall feeling is that all of this myth and enchantment exists in your own hometown, and in every other place on earth, and that if you just pay attention, you'll see all of them.<br />3. The mood--it ranges from charming to chilling, and often in the very same story.  For example, &quot;Uncle Dobbin's Parrot Faire,&quot; which you can read here on Amazon.  There's giddy romance and profound sadness...generally, the entire range of human emotion.<br />And now, what you've all been waiting for!  The Rant:<br />John Jude Palencar, get your damn dirty paws off my series!  The new Newford cover art is (if any of the publishers happen to be reading this) not only ugly when compared to the gorgeous Terri Windling art of the earlier editions, but hideous by ANYONE'S standards!  What *were* you thinking?  Folks, the old covers for this book and its companion, &quot;The Ivory And The Horn,&quot; is SO much better than this s***-brown MONSTROSITY, which doesn't even remotely capture the spirit of the series.  Go to a library book sale or a used book store and buy a copy of the old edition.  I'm serious...I am a fanatic for trade-paperbacks and textured covers, and I don't even like LOOKING at this.  Get the mass market edition.  It's pretty and blue and has an absolutely lovely cover.	2003-10-11

Since &quot;The Book of Atrix Wolfe&quot; left me a little cold, I was leery of reading another McKillip book.  I'm so glad I picked up this one, though!  I've seldom enjoyed reading a book this much...and while it is a light read, the tale stays with you.<br />This story is *almost* a fairy tale, although which one, I can't put my finger on.  There are elements of Cinderella and The Snow Queen, but nothing definate.  &quot;Ombria In Shadow&quot; does have all thr makings of a real fairy tale in and of its own right, though--a beautiful damsel in distress, a handsome half-human hero, a plucky heroine, a shapeshifing sorceress, a shadow city, magic toads, shoes made out of sapphires, enchanted artwork, and an evil witch who, for whatever reason, reminded me of Yubaba in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;<br />I would totally recommend this book to anyone who loves fairy tales and who's looking for a luxurious weekend read.	2003-09-26
US	38000759	R3ULG41TCU2FN3	0394751019	421244819	The Persian Boy	Books	4	15	26	N	N	Depends on what you're looking for...	I will come right out and say it:  I am a dirty-minded brat.  I love slash, and will read pretty much any book that focuses on a m/m relationship.  So, I read &quot;The Persian Boy,&quot; because it is the slasher's equivalent to fantasy's &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />(By the way, if you haven't got a clue what I'm talking about, what with the slasher-talk and all, just skip this review.)<br />The horrible truth of the matter is that just as every fantasy fan will swear that LotR was what got them into fantasy, and that it changed their life, yadda yadda yadda, every slash fan out there will declare that &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; is lush, beautiful poetic, the definative work on a real-life m/m relationship...so on and so forth.  And, like LotR, half of them are lying through their teeth.  <br />Oh, yes.  You know who you are.  You think that LotR's only redeeming feature is that Orlando Bloom was in it. You utterly failed to see the grand mythic beauty in it.  Instead, you saw the grand mythic boredom.  Well, &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; is a lot like that.  You pick it up thinking, &quot;Yay!  Boysmut!&quot; and instead find an endless tale of Alexander the Great's military conquests and daily life in an army camp.<br />Oh, the book TOTALLY has its moments.  Bagoas, our protagonist, is very smart and a little bitchy, which of course makes for a great narration.  And if you are interested in the history behind Alexander, then this is a fine book for you.  The writing is gorgeous, if a little purple for my personal taste.  The author clearly knows her stuff, and, more importantly, knows how to tell a good story, so the book is most definately enjoyable on that level.<br />Basically, before you run out and buy this book, know why you want to read it, and, if you have any doubts, check it out in your local library first.  I wish I had.  I'm not sorry I read it, but it really wasn't to my usual taste.	2003-09-24

After a hiatus of a few years, Poppy is back with a brilliant new short story collection, through Subterranean Press.  There's no picture of the book here, so I will give a short description of it: Teal.  It's teal.  It's very, very teal.  The dustjacket shows a very *odd* looking cat (you can see it at the Subterranean Press Website), and the interior pages are oddly textured, giving the book an overall quirky and endearing feel.  Like all of her books through Subterranean, the front page is signed.<br />And as for the stories...<br />Dispatches from Tanganyika: A Foreword--Reminds me of the forward to Neil Gaiman's \\"Smoke And Mirrors.\\"  Here you will find brief notes Poppy has written on many of her stories, as well as an...explaination for her new (remarkable) writing style.<BR> <BR>The Devil You Know--Cute.  This story is nowhere near as \\"horrific\\" as many of her earlier short stories.  Instead, it wonderfully reflects the front cover's \\"quirkiness.\\"<BR>  <BR>O Death, Where Is Thy Spatula?--Reintroducing Dr. Brite, coroner of New Orleans and Poppy's alter-ego.  (You may remember Dr. Brite from \\"In Vermis Veritas\\" in her previous short story collection.)<BR> <BR>Lantern Marsh--Very sweet, and vaguely Ray Bradbury-esque.  An odd story of childhood and change.  Not scary at all. <br />Nothing Of Him That Doth Fade--This is the only story that really left me cold.  It's definately not one of her best--Brite admits as much in the forward.<BR> <BR>The Ocean--A dark story of Orpheus in modern times.  Poppy's kind of, um, *intense* about people who think that this is a vampire story.  Because it's not.<BR> <BR>Marisol--More fun and games with Dr. Brite in the kitchen of New Orleans.  This story gives a strong message out to all us reviewers out there...be careful what you say!<BR> <BR>Poivre--Not really fiction at all.  This is more of an anecdote about an incident that happened at one of the author's favorite restaurants.  Very cute, really.<BR> <BR>Pansu--Hysterical.Just very, very funny.  Spoofs \\"The Exorcist.\\"  When I first heard descriptions of this story (\\"An ancient demon from the East seeks the pleasures of the flesh...\\") I thought that this would be a serious story.  It's really definately NOT.<BR> <BR>Burn, Baby, Burn--I forget what this story was based on, but it was good.  Very \\"Firestarter.\\"<BR> <BR>System Freeze--Written in the same world as \\"The Matrix.\\"  It's okay.  Not being a big fan of the movie, I'm not one to judge.<BR> <BR>Bayou de la Mère--We get to see Rickey and G-Man (of \\"The Value of X\\" fame) on vacation in this short piece.  G-Man is still trying to reconcile Catholisism and his sexuality, making this a very poignant piece.<BR> <BR>The Heart of New Orleans--Probably one of the BEST things Poppy has ever written, and the last Dr. Brite story in here.  This story is humerous and sad and really, really shows the true heart of New Orleans.  Anne Rice, eat your heart out.<BR> <BR>A Season in Heck--A little taste of what's to come, methinks.  This story takes place at Rickey and G-Man's restaurant, Liquor.  However, Our Couple is not the focus of this story.  No, this tale concentrates on Paul, a young line chef in the restaurant, and who has a *terrible* crush on G-Man.  Bad boy!<br />All in all, this is an A+ collection from one of my personal favorite authors.  Her new, sparser, more honest voice makes all of these stories seem a little more realistic than her earlier volumes--not in the sense of the supernatural, but in the sense of human behavior.  Poppy remains one of the few authors who can take me from laughter to tears and back again in ten pages, and this collection is proof of that.	2003-05-29

I have better things to do with my life.<br />The idea of the gender-neutral society is cool, but when you're trying to keep track of charcters who mostly go by their last names anyway, a \\"Duchess,\\" or \\"Lady\\" would be nice.  (For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, in this land (Branion), all the titles are gender-neutral.  I.e., when they say \\"Prince\\" or \\"Earl\\" or \\"Count,\\" they're not necessarily talking about a guy.)<br />Also, the pacing in this book is...wonky.  I don't know if I can think of a better word for it. For example, one minute our boy is remembering a battle he'd had against his mother, and the next minute, we're \\"back to the future\\", and his mother is dead.  There's no transitional sequence, nothing to indicate that all of this was a reverie...<br />All in all, if you enjoy slogging through epic books with character clutter, then you'll enjoy this.  I, on the other hand, am just going back to Dune, where things make sense.	2003-05-14

Okay, don't boo me into oblivion here, but...I found this book to be HYSTERICAL.  An inappropriate reaction?  Perhaps, but there you are.  As a young female, I was amused by how much of a guy's book this was.  I mean, really, there isn't a lot of plot here, but there is a lot of fighting.  For the most part, it's the Amazon legion of women all lusting after the 50th (thereabouts) incarnation of Duncan Idaho, and lesbians, and Leto angsting about being a 3,000 year old virgin worm whose girlfriend is attracted to the hunk that Leto has such as odd fixation with.<br />Dune is High School!<br />But seriously, folks, all of you who enjoyed the first Dune Trilogy...you won't be disappointed here.  God Emperor shows the decline and fall of what could have been a great empire, and is, surprisingly (given the giant worm factor here) very human and emotional.  The characters are vivid, and the gloomy settings make for a great \\"brooding\\" book.	2003-04-14

JKR is a devious writer, and she uses a lot of obscure references and hints and clues to help pull her books together into the incredible story that eventually gets scrutinized by millions upon millions of people (and yet, no one knew it was the rat in book 3).  <br />If you enjoy sleuthing out the secrets of the Harry Potter books, this is for you.  It brings up a lot of amazing plot points and little details that are easily missed, and really gives the reader something to ponder in the time until book 5 comes out.  (For example, James Potter might not REALLY be dead...)<br />This book is a little bit over the top in some parts, over-analyzing in some places and glossing over some details that one would think were important.  All in all, though, it is a fun book to read on a rainy day.	2003-04-09

It grieves me to say some of this stuff, seeing as how this series came very highly recommended from a friend (who told me to read the Arthur books, then the Aeron books, and finally the two standalones--and, given the kind of reviews Blackmantle is getting from you, my dear fellow reviewers, I do NOT think I shall be reading that one).<br />This is a series that simply didn't work for me.  I've been told that Kennealy considers this to be a sci-fi series more than a fantasy, and yet, there isn't any actual science in them.  Ships and the rare computers are controlled by crystals.  Horses still seem to provide 99.9% of transportation.  Bedding is made of fur.  There are no paternity tests, apparently (an important plot point).  This is not a scientific world.  It is a fantasy, pure and simple.<br />Also, there are no surprises.  Kennealy invokes \\"dan\\" (karma, fate, doom, whatever) at every corner, meaning that each and every major plot point is revealed well before it becomes an issue.  I found myself rolling my eyes, wondering what the Kelts would think of us Terrans, who aren't given the opportunity to know EXACTLY what we'll be having for breakfast in forty years, much less EXACTLY how long we'll live, who we'll marry, what the names of our grandchildren will be, what our great and mystical destiny will be...<br />My friend was excited to tell me that there was no Lancelet figure in this series.  Well, excepting Keils, there wasn't...but Lancelet is an important part of the Arthur legend.  A very, very important part.  Because, you see, it is mostly as a result of the whole Gwen/Lance thing that Arthur nanced off to get himself killed, and Camelot fell.  <br />Last major gripe: there is no character development anywhere here.  Oh, sure, characters grow up, and grow older, but they don't change must.  (Okay, okay, Gweniver changes a bit, over the course of her hundred or so year lifespan.)  No, Taliesin is the same person at 100 that he was at five.  Donah and Loherin and Tarian and all these other character appear and move offstage without the reader ever having any insight into their being.  <br />All of that said, there were some wonderful parts in this trilogy: the Yamazai were extremely cool, as was the whole \\"Hedge of Mist\\" idea, the idea of Taliesin's mother being from earth...probably the scene that moved me most was Arthur and company's demise, which I will not spoil for those of you intent upon reading this book.  <br />Taliesin is a great character, and a great narrator, tempered by humor and anger and love and loyalty, and one is left with the impression that there could be no better bard to tell this story.

I enjoyed reading it, sure, but it didn't affect me the way his books usually do.  Part of the problem, I think, is that I don't think even de Lint knew what he wanted this book to be about.  There is an element of Japanese culture, the cliched wastelands, the mandatory Native spirituality...but nothing really tying any of them together.  The book revs up an adrenaline high early on, keeps it going, and then just ENDS.  In, like, a page, the story reaches its climax and conclusion, and the reader is left thinking, \\"What?  It's DONE?\\"  The story doesn't feel finished to me.  There is also the annoying gratuitous character death, which is really atypical for de Lint.  He keeps introducing these characters, mostly walking sci-fi charicatures, and then kills them off.  Also, there was what I have come to call the \\"Wyrd Science\\" problem--the panoramic view of the future, the technology--basically, all the sci-fi stuff just sounded sort of off to me.<br />Don't get me wrong, here...the writing is pretty damn good, and a bad de Lint is better than a great Nina Kiriki Whatsername any day.  But this just didn't quite work for me.	2003-01-22

It was the first FLB book, and it still one of my favorites.<br />When I read the title story, I remember thinking, \\"Well,I like Sarah McLachlan, maybe I should give Tori Amos a try.\\"  (If you don't know how that story ended, well, know that I think nothing of driving ten hours to go to a Tori concert.)  And, a year or so later, I re-read the story and thought, \\"Hey, I like Sarah and Tori, maybe I should try the Cocteau Twins.\\"  Thus began another addiction which annually saps me about fifty bucks.<br />I was going through major issues with a very dear friend as I read \\"Pixie and Pony,\\" and for years now, those words have stayed with me:  \\"Best friends?  We are sisters.\\"  After my mother's injury, I struggled to reconcile the reality of her new self with the way she had once been.  The story \\"La\\" was of enormous help.<br />GG#9 is every girl's diary.  It is all of our fears and hopes and drems.  It is everything we've questioned about life, our futures, our parents, our sexuality, and love.  Each girl is perfectly unique, very mysterious, and yet completely familiar.  Each of these girls is like a little facet of each other, and of ourselves.	2003-01-13

It is a combination of facination, revulsion, admiration, and desire.  This book deals with four major characters: Luke, a pirate radio shock jock who is HIV positive; Andrew, a necrophiliac who escaped prison by dying; Tran, a Vietnamese boy who plays some rather dangerous games; Jay, a socialite cannibal.  Each of these characters has a diamondlike brilliance, in that they are strong and cold and sharp.  The descriptions of people and places here make this Poppy's best early book, hands down.<br />This book does not have a happy ending...how could it, with those characters?  But it still leaves the reader satisfied in a way that no previous book of hers ever could.  There is a HIGH squick factor here, but it exists to highlight the beauty that surrounds our main characters.	2003-01-07

Probably written during Poppy's lowest phase, this book takes all that was beautiful and terrifying about The Crow and turns it into a pointless gorefest.<br />Correct me if I'm wrong, but for a person to come back from the dead, there must have been a tremendous, horrible wrong in the world that needs to be righted.  Now, what happened to out protagonist was tragic, indeed.  However, he came back and began mindlessly killing people with little rhyme or reason.  His sister-in-law figures out what he is, and, in a bizarre and highly unlikely twist, kills herself so that she, too, can come back.<br />The Afterlife, apparently, has a revolving door.<br />Our \\"villain,\\" here, is not in any way scary...more like \\"pathetic and wierd.\\"  Thank GOD Poppy's serial killers were better developed in the brilliant Exquisite Corpse.  I had a vague annoying nag in the back of my head while reading this, thinking, \\"Why doesn't someone just hit him over the head with a chair or something?\\"  He was irritating.  He didn't know that what he was doing was really, per se, wrong, which takes out a large degree of the \\"scary, evil man against the Moral Right,\\" which the Crow series is really, when you get down to it, based on.<br />There is one well-developed character in here: the police detective, hiding his sexuality to avoid flak from his coworkers.  And yet, he dies pointlessly, and I was left wondering why he was in the book at all.  He contributed nothing to the plot, and seemed like nothing more than filler.<br />To anyone out there who wants to read a good Poppy book, I would have to recommend Exquisite Corpse or Drawing Blood.  Poppy is one of the few writers whose (very exprensive limited edition) books (and chapbooks) I buy without hesitation.  But this...this is a mess.	2003-01-07

I've read them both twice, to be fair, and don't really intend to read them again.<br />Perhaps I just don't understand this brand of &quot;horror.&quot;  Throughout the entire story, I wondered what I was intended to think of the characters.  Was I supposed to like them?  Was I supposed to care about them at all?  If so, then I must have missed something.  All I saw were a bunch of boring Gen X-ers in a small town who died in some bizarre, but ultimately inexplicably dull ways for no apparent reason.  If there was a point to this book, other than &quot;Some stuff that happened to these people I once knew,&quot; I couldn't find it.	2003-01-06

When it finally arrived, I was vaguely disappointed.  Why?<br />-As has been previously mentioned, the last third or so of the book was \\"Seven Wild Sisters.\\"  SWS is a stunning story, and absolutely should be printed in a cheaper edition than the lovely but expensive Subterranean Press edition.  However, though the Dillard stories are set in the same \\"universe\\" as the Newford Tales, they don't really go together.  IMHO, de Lint probably should have waited for the next couple of Dillard stories (A Circle of Cats, Medicine Road) and published them--and the few short stories based on the Dillard tales--in one volume together.<br />-All of the events of \\"Tapping the Dream Tree\\" are set BEFORE \\"The Onion Girl.\\"  While I do realize that it takes time to write good short stories, I (and every other rabid Newford fan) was looking forward to finding out more about Jilly's recovery and the aftermath of TOG.  To find that the stories reflected none of the maelstrom of pain and wonder and hope that was \\"The Onion Girl\\" was very disappointing.<br />-The short stories themselves are a bit lackluster.  De Lint is a master storyteller, and there are a few of his stories (\\"The Moon is Drowning While I Sleep,\\" \\"Winter Was Hard,\\" \\"Wishing Well\\") that still give me the goosebumps.  Most of Newford's usually vivid cast seems tired and out of place--and, furthermore, out of character--in this collection.  De Lint is usually a master wordsmith, coaxing poetry out of the most ordinary things in our everyday life.  Here, though, he just seems to be relating events that happened to some people he hardly knows.<br />De Lint has a lot on his plate right now, given the collaborations with the fantasy art genius Charles Vess, and with the new Newford novel \\"Spirits in the Wires\\" coming out soon.  However, I hope that the next Newford collection is a little more like \\"Dreams Underfoot\\" or \\"The Ivory and the Horn.\\"	2003-01-02

She's an awesome writer when she really gets going, and her new stuff is amazing.  She's writing about very, very human things, which are just so much scarier than the subjects of her first few books.  Take Zee, in &quot;The Crystal Empire.&quot;  She doesn't get what her boyfriend sees in this singer--she's a little scornful of the whole situation.  However, she still openly believes that what he says, goes.  That's SCARY.  I've known people like that, who are willing to sacrifice their own will to another.<br />&quot;Onion&quot; is actually the best CRK story I've read since reading &quot;Souveniers&quot; in The Dreaming series.  However...she still needs work.  I had to read and reread &quot;Onion&quot; to figure out just what was going on.  It's better than Silk or Threshold, but not by much.  Oh well.<br />&quot;The Rest of the Wrong Thing&quot; was GREAT.  PZB and CRK are fabulous collaborative writers.  It brought back that wonderful small-town creepiness that I loved about Drawing Blood (and, to a lesser degree, Lost Souls.  I just didn't like LS very much).<br />All in all, a B+ effort from two great writers.	2002-11-06

Brite has been a cult horror phenomenon for quite a while, and has been a major voice for all the little gothlings out there.  But even the Brite One gets tired of purple proze, I guess.  So she gives us this gem!<br />I don't want to spoil too much of the plot for anyone, so I will leave my review at this: Poppy's writing style has CHANGES.  This is no lush, florid tome where you read endless descriptions of blood in the moonlight and the lynx-green of a serial killer's eyes.  No, here you will simply meet two nice young guys (who are, indeed, in a relationship--Poppy hasn't changed THAT much) who live in a rather slummy section of New Orleans and who dream of being chefs.<br />(Cue lush, florid descriptions of food.  I swear, you'll gain a couple pounds just reading this book.)<br />There is no supernatural horror here...there is only the much more realistic horror of a young couple in love being separated by the parents who only want to \\"do the right thing.\\"  The book follows their tenative courtship, their early, rocky relationship, their time working in restaurants in the city, and their separation.  It's a great little love story, and a much more accurate portrayal of New Orleans than one would find in, say, an Anne Rice book.<br />For anyone else who liked this, Subterranean Press is also publishing a chapbook of Poppy's, entitled \\"The Feast of St. Rosalie,\\" also about the Stubbs family. Her recent short-story book, The Devil You Know,\\" also features a few stories about Gary and Rickey (as well as the illustrious Dr. Brite, for anyone who read \\"Are You Loathesome Tonight?\\"). Forthcoming in 2004 is another story about these characters, entitled \\"Liquor.\\"	2002-10-28
US	38000759	R1CUZESJXJPKPF	014230218X	390872528	The Dreaming Place	Books	4	31	31	N	N	Newford Lite	Let's face it...there are some Newford books that you have to make charts and maps and timelines for just to figure out what's going on.  Not that I'm complaining--Jilly and Wendy and Sophie, Christy and Geordie, and newcomers like Mick and the Crow Girls are like slightly out-of-town best friends, and the city of Newford sprawls out on the landscape of one's imagination--it's a city that EVERYONE wants to visit.<br />\\"The Dreaming Place\\" is a Newford book without all of the backstory, which is vaguely annoying and slightly relieving at the same time.  In \\"The Onion Girl,\\" I kept a list on the inside cover of who all the minor characters (Mona, Margaret, etc.) were, and where I remembered them from.  Here, there was none of that...just a straightforward story about an angry young girl having trouble finding a place in a stange country after losing her mother.  So much trouble, in fact, that she attracts the attention of Something Nasty, and gets her naive cousin in Big Trouble.<br />Fans of de Lint's urban fantasy won't be disappointed in this light read.  (Also, Newford buffs, I believe that this marks the first appearance of Cassie and Bones, of \\"Trader\\" and \\"The Onion Girl\\" fame.)  the only thing that really got to me was the atrocious font that this book was printed in, and believe me, I got over that pretty quickly.  So don't judge this book by its length, or the fact that it's classified as a children's book.  \\"The Dreaming Place\\" fits flawlessly into the heart and soul of Newford.	2002-10-24

I liked the basic plot.  Here's what I didn't like.<br />-Arachne and Reggie were 2-D, laughable, silly villains.<br />-There are some inconsistancies with the previous two books set in this &quot;universe.&quot;  For example, the issue of &quot;Cold Iron,&quot; and why the Elementals wouldn't go to a place with Cold Iron present.  Think back to The Fire Rose (by far the best book of the series).  In TFR, there are IRON ELEMENTALS, practically!  <br />-Still too much Suffragette soapboxing.  I mean, sheesh, Misty, we women are liberated, now, thank you very much, get back to the plot.<br />-Too much backstory.  Too much time is spent watching Marina prance about the countryside.  I know that many people don't agree with me, but TFR again had it just right: no more than three or four chapters of backstory, interspersed into the novel, rather than taking up half the book describing the main character's bedroom, her dresses, her horse, her furniture...<br />All in all, it was an enjoyable read, but the errors and plot holes grated at my nerves too much for me to go back and reread it.	2002-09-17

The book was the diary of a ditzy teen (lovable, but still ditzy) who was witnessing a very intricate political plot unfold around her.  The clues are all in there for the reader to find...'cause Poddy sure ain't seeing them.  And the ultimate goal in this book was not to have Poddy grow up and make more Poddys.  It was to redeem Clark.  Re-read the endings.  In one, Clark basically shrugs off everything that has happened.  Poddy was hurt, but she's gonna be okay, so he doesn't have anything to worry about.  In the \\"new\\" ending (the ending as Heinlein rightly intended it) Clark is forced to wake up and smell the evil.  For the first time, he must own up to his actions and start acting with compasssion for others.  <br />Re-read the book if you didn't like it.  Go on.  I dare you.	2002-05-31

American Gods was a GREAT BOOK, the like of which has been seldom seen for the last decade.  I don't doubt that it shall spawn a few graphic novels, a film, several volumes of short stories by other major authors in that field, etc.  But, when you get right down to it, I didn't like it as much as most of Gaiman's other works.  It wasn't as dark or as fantastic as Neverwhere, it lacked the atomic punch of most of his better short stories, like Snow, Glass, Apples or Murder Mysteries, and it didn't really have the mythological intricacy of the Sandman series.  I suppose that this is because there wasn't enough TIME in which to develop the story as it deserved to be developed.  So many little storylines seemed broken off.  Others were just completely unneccesary.  Overall, I just got the impression that this might have worked a bit better if it was done as a series, or as a couple of graphic novels.  (Imagine the illustration of the scene where all those dieties gather!)<br />Still, it was written by Gaiman, and and he is unquestionably the master of modern mythology.  So...enjoy!	2002-05-23

Why there's \\"The Disc\\" and The Opera House practically on the same street?  Why some places seem Medaevil, and others seem pre-Industrial?  Well, here's the answer to all of your questions!  No more headachey arguments with your fellow Fans of Pterry!  No more discussions of quantum effects on the Discworld!  (You can pick up The Science of Discworld for THAT.)<br />This book is really only for long-time, well-established Discworld fans.  Newcomers will NOT understand some of the nuances of this book, and will be confused/disappointed.  Those of us who are longtime fans will recognize the in-jokes and references to earlier Pratchett works.<br />The best way to read Discworld is in order, people.  The earliest three (The Color of Magic, The Light Fantastic, and Equal Rites) are a little mind-numbing, but overall will help you understand the Disc better.<br />My only real complaint about this book is that Death and Susan weren't in it enough...it wasn't nearly as good as the other Death books.

While de Lint's Newford books are BY FAR his best, they are a little confusing to jump into headfirst.  Greenmantle and Yarrow provide the reader with a great way to understand the modern master of urban fantasy.  The characters are warm, vivid, and funny.  The settings are lush, and eerily familiar at times (as though you really LIVE the tale).<br />The order that I would personally recommend reading de Lint books:  Yarrow, Greenmantle, Memory and Dream, Dreams Underfoot, Trader (this one is a little hard to find, but it's totally worth it) , The Ivory and The Horn, Someplace to be Flying (my own favorite), Moonlight and Vines, Forests of the Heart, anf finally The Onion Girl (which is basically the all-star Newford book, so make sure you read the others first, or you won't know ANY of the characters).  There are other books of his, that I have never been so enamored of; The Moonheart books, Svaha, The Little Country, etc.  <br />If you are an aspiring writer, and are prepared to drop a few bucks, get Triskell Tales.  It's a wonderful way to see the way a witer can develop in terms of style and story.  Also, check out his new collaboration with Charles Vess, Seven Wild Sisters.	2002-04-26

I came to the semi-painful realization that de Lint's Newford books are the only ones that I really like.  Memory and Dream didn't do a lot for me.  I LOVED Dreams Underfoot.  And then Trader.  Near as I can figure, in the Newford chronology of things, Trader HAS to come between Dreams Underfoot and The Ivory And The Horn.  <br />I really, really liked it.  The back cover describes it as &quot;an adult coming of age story,&quot; and I would agree.  The characters are vivid, funny, realistic...very passionate as well, which is very important for me.  <br />While Someplace to Be Flying is definately my favorite de Lint book, Trader is really up there, too.	2002-04-16

I think that if this book had been a little better organized (and the characters a bit more believable) I would have enjoyed it more.

Frankly, I didn't see the point to this book--Lavan Firestorm is a character who was mentioned ONCE in the entire course of the series.  He starts fires.  That's about it.  He has no control over what he does, so there is little personal development here.  And, about his personality...<br />Lackey has once again attempted to seduce us with the plight of a poor, mistreated waif who has never been shown the least kindness.  Now, this worked with Talia.  She was sweet and good and growing up in a extremely restricted society.  And it worked with Vanyel--Van was a brat at the beginning, but that was a big part of his early character.  Besides, he had reasons to be so annoying.  Darien...was less convincing to me.  He was just a surly little punk, living within a bizarre northern village.  I didn't much care for him.  Lavan...I HATED the boy.  The only great crime done to him was that his parents *gasp* made him go to school.  The horrors...  His Companion annoyed the heck out of me with her constant gushingly sweet speech.  <br />Also, the timeline of the book was all off.  By my reckoning, Lavan became a full Herald in less than a year, which blows my mind.  As for the other characters...very weak, very one-dimensional.  Very dull with very predictable speech and predictable actions.<br />All in all, a disappointing potboiler from Lackey.  If she insists on writing books about ancient characters, why not Stefen?  Or Need?  Or Baron Valdemar, founder of our beloved countr?  Anything but another needy suicidal teenager.	2002-02-11
