Think "Dinotopia"	Told in the format of a journal (Lord Nathaniel Parker's).  The 1812 expedition to undiscovered islands is richly illustrated with paintings of every kind.  The scientific Lord Parker documents everything with ease, insects, animals, and plants.  If you like anything imaginative, you should try to read it.<br />I'm telling you, the book is nothing but color.  It seems so real.  I especially like the story of the giant carnivorous plant that leaves off a scent which smells like everyone's favorite food.  A sailor gets stuck in it and they have to cut him out.  (\\"Seamen, my dear, are not the brightest of people as a rule.\\")  He writes much of it to his dear Belinda.  (He kept the journal for her benefit.)	2003-09-28

This book feels like it's for already-successful, American-style comic artists, so that they can learn to morph their styles, manga-like, and produce pseudo-manga.<br />I enjoyed this book as a quick look-through-and-read-the-interesting-sections.  And there are lots of interesting sections.  But, if you want to learn how to draw as a beginner (not already experienced in drawing), this is not for you.<br />This is a good introduction to some of the stereotypes, normal assumtions of manga, and face- and body-structures.<br />The eye sections are very good.<br />The fight-stuff is very good.<br />The villain and anti-heros sections are very good.<br />And the interview with Bill Flanagan of Viz is fascinating -- especially his breakdown of why people like manga vs. American comic books.<br />There are also sections on elves, children, fuzzy sidekicks, giant robots, points-of-view, panels, and \\"manga babes.\\"<br />>makes face&lt;<br />Okay.  Anyway, it's a good introduction to pseudo-manga, and an interesting take on many of the concepts manga is based on.  Don't try to copy the style too exactly, and you'll be O.K.<br />Look through it in Borders if you get the chance, to see if you want to buy it.	2003-05-04

Gallico.<br />It's just exactly as fun as it sounds.  The author writes about how he &quot;found&quot; the manuscript, then translated it.  The book itself is a first-person &quot;how-to&quot; book from the perspective of a cat.<br />There are chapters like &quot;Tidbits at the Table&quot; (go for the man first, then everyone will give in), &quot;Take Over&quot; and &quot;Doors&quot; (if you learn to open them, never let on, or they'll stop waiting on you).  Some of it's a bit much, such as the way to butter up men.  (And the &quot;Food&quot; chapter is positively Machivellian.)<br />Since it's all in good fun (and occasionally quite sweet), I enjoy this kind of thing.  There is some actual facts, but they never get in the way of the flavor: pure fun.<br />Lots of black and white photos complete this funny jaunt.  This book would be enjoyed even by people who believe cats _are_ controlling like this.	2003-04-15

This book was published in 1965, and it's still just amazing.  Certainly some further scientific advancements have been made; maybe some of the mystery monsters have since been identified.  But no other book has ever, or will ever, come close to capturing the sense of wonder, awe, and absolute MYSTERY that this book has.<br />Along with accounts of relatively ordinary creatures like the heaviest whale ever weighed, and the several-foot-long earthworms, this book has engagingly told accounts of the Flathead Lake monster, the capture of the biggest manta ever caught, and the sighting of a huge, unknown turtle-like creature off the coast of Scotland, and dozens of other first-person accounts of people discovering, or spotting, previously-unknown animals -- many of which are still a mystery.<br />There's the story of the bacteria found alive after 1,200 years in a Mayan tomb, the story of a young sea serpent -- so many great stories.  There are black-and-white photographs, but only of known creatures.  Even so, some of them are really good, like the fifteen-foot pike-like fish two men are hauling in the snow.<br />Plus, this book is really well written.  It has the enthusiasm, factual details, and scientific (but never boring) telling of first-hand accounts that will inspire anyone!!<br />If you're an adult, read it.  If you're a kid, read it twice as quick!  Because who knows, you could grow up and discover a mystery monster of your own -- or identify one of these!<br />The book is 191 pages long, including bibliography, but don't be afraid to skip around and read the most interesting parts first -- especially the unknown sea creatures bits.  That and the Mayan bacteria story.	2003-04-14

But oddly, I still find myself remembering it.  It pulled me in.<br />There were some very sad parts, definitely tragedy in here.  It was memorable and unexpected.  It managed to pull me in, from half-hearted to fascinated.  It wasn't a \\"one sitting\\" book, but it kept me interested.  It built.<br />This is a fascinating look at medieval life.  I found the characters well-drawn and interesting -- even the ones you hated.  (It did seem like the king got off the hook a little too much, morally.  But he was so sympathetic it was hard to remember.)  I don't generally consider myself a reader of historical or political fiction, but this was fascinating -- not overblown or down-bogging.<br />This book got me interested in 1066.<br />If you like books for young adults, books about young people trying to find their way in a hostile world, or books about the middle ages, you should try this.  Heck, even if you don't like those things, try it anyway!  It's an excellent example of a story that takes place over a period of time, letting actual things change in the characters' lives.<br />And the raven foreshadowing was spooky!	2003-04-09

The thing about this book was that it felt _REAL_.  It was hard to remember it was *just* a book.<br />You felt the danger; you felt the bruises on the ribs.  You wanted the hero to make it.  You just didn't find yourself doubting the realness of it.<br />Now, it's been a couple years since I read this, so perhaps I was just more gullible.  But I don't think so.  I still remember it, after all this time.  Its magic was a special fete considering I had NEVER been interested in the Roman era or historical mysteries.<br />When the book was over, I wanted it to keep going.<br />An excellent historical mystery.  I highly doubt you'll regret reading it.	2003-04-09

There's clear documentation of the human and dinosaur footprints being together -- even overlapping.  It's a fascinating book, even though the writing is scholarly and occasionally inaccesible.  Extremely well-documented.<br />Especially intriguing were the things about giant footprints... I wish they'd talked even more about these!<br />If you're interested in this subject at all, you should probably check it out.	2003-03-23

Of course, no one needs another review on Hazel and Fiver and the bunch, but ...  how can I resist?<br />When you're thinking of reading this book, please  don't think it is some thick, depressing and/or literary take on children's rabbit stories.  That's what I was afraid it was going to be, but I started reading it anyway...<br />Then, the first page was full of plant descriptions and stuff... and I was ready to close the book, thinking ::I bet this is going to be boring AND depressing!::.  Thoroughly, not-quite-fairly fed up (I hadn't even given it a decent chance), I flipped to the back  page before I gave up and closed the book.<br />You're not supposed to do that.  But it saved the book for me.<br />I was immediately struck by the parallel between the first and last lines of the book.  The first line is:  &quot;The primroses were over.&quot;<br />The last line of the book ended with  &quot;... where the first primroses were beginning to bloom.&quot;<br />Silly thing to be impressed by, huh?  But it did -- impress me, that is.  It meant: this author is going to play fair.  He wants to come full circle.<br />He means to give me a feel-good ending that is both literarily and emotionally impressive.<br />And he did.  He did.<br />Five stars is far too few.	2003-02-28

Quite a fun read, about a boy and his dog -- a dog that just happens to have special mind-reading powers.<br />My library listed it in the children's book section, although it was probably really meant for teens, as the plot's premise takes awhile to set up.  (Maybe not; I guess kids' books can be about teens.)<br />Yes, you will see some campy stuff like the circus guy who wants to steal the dog, flying saucers, etc, but it's done enjoyably.<br />Anyway, if you enjoy 60's era science fiction with the young adult, youthful-enthusiasm feel, along with a fun and interesting premise and a decent follow-through, you'll enjoy this.  _I_ consider it as classic as Heinlein's \\"Star Beast,\\" \\"Have Space Suit, Will Travel,\\" and \\"Red Planet.\\"<br />See for yourself!	2003-02-24

He's a great writer.  His chatty, informative, and funny style are sure to please anyone interested in plants, wild plants, food, or survival.<br />Don't think of this as a handbook for herb hunting; if you do you'll be a little disappointed.  Think of it as an amazing, meandering journey through the mind and experiences of a GENIUS among men at understanding and finding wild plants.  If you're interested in plants, survival food, or even gourmet cooking, I believe you'll find Euell Gibbons a king among men.<br />There are chapters in this book about wilderness survival, camping out &quot;nature style,&quot; making maple syrup, the vitamin contents of common &quot;weeds,&quot; making a dill crock, seaweeds, The Teas of the Revolution, and essays on ecology.  All of this is fascinatingly packed with bits of specifics about plant species and how to prepare the edible ones.  It isn't in the format for plant identification; there are only a few pictures per chapter.  (For that, let me suggest &quot;Feasting Free on Wild Edibles,&quot; by Bradford Angier.)<br />All in all, an excellent book.  Especially memorable are the chapters about Gibbons staying on an island and eating only from it, and his charming &quot;survival in the wilds of central park.&quot;<br />Get this book; you won't be sorry.  You'll feel like you're meeting a new friend.<br />Keep in mind, however, that this was written in '66, so some of the very specific advice might be a tiny bit outdated.  But I think nearly all of it stays surprisingly fresh.  A very encouraging book.	2003-02-21

Infact there are so many 'receipes' that it occasionally comes over as a frusterated gormet cookbook!<br />But don't worry; the first and best purpose is finding out which plants are edible.

Yes, the writing is charming, and the characters are endearing, but without the illustrations (by Garth Williams), these books would only be so much children's literature.  With the ink drawings, they're Children's Literature WITH REALLY CUTE PICTURES.  (um, ok, let me try again...)<br />These are children's books without, perhaps, deep plots, but they will certainly be remembered by children for the pictures and characters, and by the parents for the charming, unexpected turns of phrase.  I read one of these books when I was a child, and one a few weeks ago.  I must say I enjoyed them both times.  If you or your child like mouse adventure stories, I urge you to give these a try.  I'd say the reading level is ten or twelve.  Younger children probably would like them read aloud.<br />As the reviewer on the back of one of these books says, \\"the plot is pure marshmallow fluff... but the characters!

Anyone can think through precog and throw around intriguing characters.  It's not enough.  Bring it together and make it work.<br />Thumbs down.	2003-02-18

Yet he's fun and open-minded and, if not the opposite of snobbish, at least not too high-minded to mind a joke at his expense.<br />The first person viewpoint goes well with this series, allowing us to see all his views and inside knowledge.  We find ourselves rooting for the fashion-conscious, social conscious narrator.<br />What I especially like about this series is that the hero always has a good reason for getting involved.  He's no world-weary private eye, but rather a loyal friend with a rapier sharp wit and plenty of wits about him.<br />In short, this series is fresh, readable, and fun.  We root for and sympathize at the right places, and end up wanting more.  Very hard to put down!	2003-02-18
US	35782559	R2JIQTLT15KOB9	0517320975	851784580	Omnibus Of Science Fiction	Books	5	8	8	N	N	great stuff	A lot of fun stuff from the fifties and earlier.<br />Some very thought provoking and well-written, some forgettable (or a little, um, outdated), but still fun the read.  Everything from Lovecraft's amazing &quot;The Color Out Of Space&quot; to a forgettable &quot;Counter Charm&quot; by Peter Philips.<br />There's a story about excessive hair growth, one on killer bees, a horror type on a doorbell, a very good &quot;Recruiting Station&quot; by Van Vogt... involves some time travel...  Bradbury's &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;... basically 560 pages of old sf to keep you busy...  I enjoyed it.	2003-02-12

And I couldn't put it down.<br />In retrospect, it was probably no better than other books on writing, but it dealt with things I was interested in -- are writers born or made, transitions, revisions, the importance of reading (actually, everybody's got their own opinion on that), characterization and viewpoint.  Now, it's not that I hadn't already heard or known some of this stuff, but it was just what I needed.  Authors opinions and struggles, sympathy and even occasional rants.  The thing was, although I was less experienced, I knew a lot of the same things in my bones, and it was good to have them confirmed.<br />Another thing was that sometimes the authors disagreed!  This is good to know, because when you read a book by one author, if he says something that just doesn't work for you, you think there's something wrong with you.  But when you see equally sucessful authors disagreeing over things (outlines, no outlines), it can be rather freeing.  Keep in mind that it was written in the 80s so it isn't going to be market help to you.  But the advice is still pretty fresh, for the most part.<br />In short, I recommend this as a good read, interesting, informative, and fun (if you're seventeen, and you find it at your grandmother's, and you can't put it down...)<br />She gave me that book, before I left.  I still have it.<br />Trust me, it's worth a lot more than 48 cents.	2003-01-30

That isn't made as clear as it could be on this page.<br />I guess you already know this volume deals mostly with the characters' pasts.<br />Now, what did I think of it?  Glad you asked.  I liked it.  It's both funny and serious.  Although I must say it can be a bit confusing; sometimes it seems to jump around without enough explanation).<br />Dragon Knights feels like shojo to me, even though it seems to be mostly magic / action and not much romance.  The characters are very cute although drawn a little weird sometimes. (Rune looks like a girl sometimes.)  They're skinny and (especially Rath!) young-looking.  Also hair tends to be a big thing with the artist.  And think Clamp's pointy-male-faces, only more so.<br />Okay, here's my question.  Does anyone else think Rath looks a lot like a very young, sweet version of Hiei?  (The hair, the fire powers, eagerness to fight...)  Hm.  He is far more cheerful than Hiei, though.  Which is kind of nice.	2003-01-23
US	35782559	R27GQO9ZIVPEPF	1931514518	181185441	Kodocha: Sana's Stage, Volume 2	Books	5	3	3	N	N	improving already	Well, the first review makes it sound very flat and boring, but really there's a lot more depth to the plot and subplots than that.  Again, both serious and funny, this is a very faceted book, and, I think, much better than the first one.  (More character exploration, less violence.)  Sorry. \\"Character exploration\\" makes it sound stuffy; it's not.  It's just that, even the funny or previously nasty characters seem to take on more personality, more real-ness.<br />That first review makes Rei (her manager) sound cruel.  He's  not.  He's much kinder than it sounds -- a very interesting character.	2003-01-21

It's not what I'd have done with the premise, but it's probably better than I  could've done.  The science was concrete,  the  suspense was marvellous, and frankly it was a good read.  There's not as much evolution/ creation angst as there was in Oxygen, and certainly no conclusions drawn about it.  (Which, if you think about it, is best -- this isn't a textbook; it's fiction dealing with the human element,  not unprovable arguments.  If I'd written it, I'd probably have made it into a theme-paper about creationism, whereas what they did was suspense sf, and a darn good job.)<br />I guess one problem I had with it was that the ending seemed less perfect than Oxygen; i.e. there were still questions left unanswered.  I'm hoping for a third book from this  talented team, because, even with my nit-picking, this is still  the best book  I've read all  year.  Kudos, dudes!	2003-01-21

It kept me reading with its fast pacing mile-a-minute humor and tension (alternating  with little warning).  You've probably already read the plot.  It sounds like a story for kids but  really it's better suited, I think,  for teens or older.  Just the way it switches from funny to scary could be a little ... weird for kids.  (Maybe kids are more  mature than  I  think?)  But, there's  definitely  four or five disturbing  scenes, violent  in a very non-funny way.  (e.g. kids threatening teachers, and threatening or  trying  to hurt each other in kind of scary ways.)<br />Saying that,  it's an  engaging and often hilarious read, but  it is  rated 13 + for a reason, even if  not all people would agree with my analysis.<br />I would also say that  the sidebars by the author  are funny and interesting, but again not the best influence for kids.  (Author talks about how she is so much happier  being  stupid than she was when  she was a good student,  and laughs about getting drunk with a friend.)  Again, not the worst stuff in the world, but if you're thinking  of getting it for a little kid  because it sounds like a \\"young\\" manga, please consider getting it for yourself instead, and then sharing it  with kid(s),  if  you think they would be able to handle  it.  Really,  it's not as young as it sounds, and I enjoyed it.  Just thought I should mention this.  And, it's not all violent; it comes to a very sweet ending.	2003-01-21

With large print, line illustrations, and short chapters ranging from \\"The State that wasn't there\\" to \\"The Heavy Pants of Mr. Strauss,\\" it tells snippets of history in an interesting way for children.  Would be especially good to read aloud to young children to help them get interested in history.  Best chapter?  Probably \\"How the Hole Got There,\\" about doughnuts!	2003-01-17
