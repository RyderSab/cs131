Usually books go into so much detail that it's hard to get a very basic understanding without too much scientific jargon.  This one was very good at explaining and well laid out diagrams and pictures. It's 63 pages but most are only one-fourth full of text.

I heard about this book on Air America and thought it would be a good read.  I was getting a sense that he leaned wrong when I read about Michael Newdow.  Stating Mr. Newdow chooses to be offended or marginalized because under god is in the Pledge.  Feldman states the Jehovah Witnesses had the right idea by asking to be excused or stay quiet during the Pledge.   Sorry, but it's not a choice to be offended.  Why is it okay to allow pro-religious bunk to go unchallenged when there is no fact or science to support it?  Should we allow creationism ID in science class?  The scientists who support evolution are choosing to be offended?  When does standing up to the religious majority become okay?  If it's just words and no physical harm is done then allow us the same opportunity.  Allow science teachers to spend weeks on exploring how all the supernatural ideas in the bible fail scientific examination?  Religion has survived so long because challenging it gets one marginalized.  That is the choice others make against someone who dares to confront religion.  It's a choice to allow superstitious mythology to be in our government and not say anything.  The original Pledge did not have under god in it.  Newdow is asking for it to be reverted back to the way it was.  Even I could see that Newdow would be taking it too far to the left if he asked the Pledge to be amended to state \\"not under/over/around/ or near a god\\".      He didn't ask for that and that is the point Feldman and I disagree on.  Newdow wanted secular neutrality, Feldman wants generic religious ideas left alone.	2005-07-07

Books	3	10	43	N	N	The bad rating is from his exporting ideas	The negativity comes from his capitalism ideas. I just watched the 20/20 show on 1/28/05 and he says \\"not allowing exporting is un-American.\\" Really?  Sorry John but we are constantly told to \\"buy American\\".  It was made Walmart.   Now, Walmart cheats their employees and the American shopper and is the #1 importer.  It took a state representative and an analysis to show me how Walmart and exporting jobs ruins the lower class and America.  A company supplying Walmart with union workers will only save a few hundred thousand a year by outsourcing their manufacturing after paying taxes on the import merchandise.  The jobs Walmart creates are lower paying jobs with late night or weekend work with poor benefits.  That money the company saved by exporting can easily be recouped by reducing the CEO and executives salary.  Oh, and simply make the CEO a 2 year contract.  They don't get paid the $50,000 a year for both years if they don't fulfil the entire contract.  Yes, many will take the experience and look for another job but 2 years for a CEO is not bad since they turnover that often anyway. <br /> <br />edworkforce.house.gov/democrats/WALMARTREPORT.pdf <br /> <br />From his book: Ben and Jerry's is the perfect example of limited capitalism.  5 or 7 times any employee is acceptable.  Stossel says it didn't work because Ben and Jerry couldn't find an acceptable CEO candidate.  Bull,  a candidate who won't accept a $100,000 salary and possible $10,000 signing bonus?  Fine, get someone with a $50,000 a year salary with $75,000 bonus.  That is incentive.  I know plenty of 30 year olds with an MBA and several years experience who will work for that.  I know plenty of 40 year olds who would too.  His example in the book was one CEO who made 30 million and said he didn't have to work another day in his life.  Fine, let's increase the tax for those in the higher end bracket from 37% to 47% with no loop holes to reduce their tax bracket.  They don't really create more jobs with that money just more money for themselves.  That's all they are really doing.   GM has always made money but executive greed keeps them importing the parts for Chevy and exporting jobs to Mexico keeps the prices competitive.  But why can't GM executives just accept a $75,000 salary?  That's plenty to live on in the Detroit area.  The day someone shows me how they have \\"earned\\" $200,000 a year I will give them credit but no one has.  I have worked with the Department of Defense and many private sector corporate executives.  All of them that make that much are expendable and don't earn it.  But how do we stop the greedy ones at the top when they make the rules?  That's the problem right there.  Unions may have their problems but they fight for the average worker.  That is why Walmart got rid of their meat department, they formed a union and the greedy Sam Walton heirs didn't like it.  Please email if you are worth more than $200,000 a year.  I have got to hear how, md457@hotmail.com	2005-01-30

This book definitely made me think more on certain ideas.  I have even come to the realization that if theists would agree that god is only an idea I could understand how they say they believe in a god. Not that god is real but that god is an image they use to be better humans.  However as the book lays out many theists think there is some all-powerful man in the sky watching over us yet not one shred of evidence supports this. The natural laws allow us to live on earth now but it wasn't that way billions of years ago.  Evolution took place. The book has a perfect comparison of this when he simply makes up a creature and gives this creature all-powerful characteristics.  That's a nice story to tell but George is willing to admit that the creature doesn't exist.  He admits that he simply made it up and just because people believe it doesn't make the creature real.  The burden of proof was on George to define this creature and unlike theists he admitted it wasn't real.  There is no clear definition of god as the book points out because god is just an idea and even the definition evolves.  The Holy Trinity was decided by a group of men in the 4th century by a vote.  George admits atheists don't know everything and never will.  But they don't stop looking and give credit to his creature idea or any mythical god. Good intermediate to higher level of atheism book considering it is more than 20 years old.	2001-11-02

The entire theme is based on the presumption the husband needs to find jesus and the wife just needs to endure.  I read on to see how wives could cope with this.  It all leads on to say how the wife can pray to god, how the husband challenges her about church ideas and what she can do to get her husband to do to hopefully find god. Maybe the husbands realize they can't find god because they can't find Santa, both mythical characters. Maybe Michael should have counter-balanced the book with some positive aspects of a divided house. My wife actually has a dear friend who thinks the earth is 6000 years old.  Do I belittle her or her friend?  No, I point out if they go near this type of thinking that science isn't perfect, but carbon-dating isn't off by 4 billion years.  Michael presumes that a wife with faith is a good thing.  He's fine there, but to say that having a husband that has investigated mythology and simply realizes that jehovah and jesus are in that category isn't a good thing is why is book sells to women who have been duped.  This book is just a gender based plea to prostelytize.  Wives if your atheist husband treats you well he believes in something better than god, he believes in you.	2001-08-15

An acquaintance,~Rob, didnt appreciate my review of another McDowell book and said I should look up a better book, this one. He probably thinks that Josh wont trump lies down my throat. Okay, I scanned this book randomly.  Page 33, Josh states the prior material to page 33 does not prove the bible is the word of god.  He outright admits that.  Page 34, he says the Bible has always been the Word of God and not voted by men. The Council of Nicea didnt vote which books are to be compiled in the bible which became the Apocrypha?  Yes, the men voted on which books became the bible.  Page 39, he defines what the Apocrypha is and says that some books are okay if labeled scripture and yet he never says if the Apocrypha is or isnt inspired.  Guess it depends on which god you worship, the Catholic or Protestant god.  Page 94, he says that we can prove the 10 commandments are a historical document but not inspired by god.  I fully agree.  The bible is in existence.  That is his point.  The bible merely being in existence and some believe it to be inspired by a supernatural being is archeological evidence of god.  Josh never proves god exists.  The main character of his preconceived bias. The bible exists therefore one can believe that its truly from god.  What a leap.  The bible is just a mythology book, a masterpiece of fiction.  Now, I ask for evidence of god which I never seem to find in the book.  Concrete evidence of any form.  Page 125 may explain why.  The basis for believing in miracles  is covered. He says that if you can have enough faith that god created the heavens and the earth like Genesis 1:1 says then you can believe Mary was a virgin and a Mary gave birth to a god made flesh. The Lord Krishna was born of a virgin, but Josh says that jesus is the name of this virgin born god.  You can also believe god walked on water he says if you want to.  I would really like the see the second one.  In the history of the world, one man named jesus could walk on water.  A little evidence is required.  Page 131 explains how Matthew 12:40 tells of Jonah being inside a sea monster for three days.  Is the bible referring to a dinosaur?  A little vague and way off in evolutionary time.  We simply dont know but I ask for evidence of someone living in a sea being for three days.  He then does the same thing for jesus being buried and in the tomb for 3 days and then rising.  No real evidence, just some grave-diggers and people wanted the body for an unknown reason.  Maybe carnivores ate jesus, we simply dont know.  He never proves either 3 day event.  Now I am not insulting Josh, just the reason to believe his reference book.  He then critiques and compares to Christianity the American-made religions like JWs and Mormons.  He explains the negativity of Hinduism, Buddhism, the Moonies and others.  In Islam I understand that jesus wasnt god, just maybe a prophet.  Are the christians or muslims right about jesus?  I hope this is a review you will find full of skepticism based on my own questioning.  I didnt have to use any references ~Rob.

I sent him the book back with questions to be answered six months ago.  I have heard nothing which is what I expected.  Beware of people who don't criticize enough, they are gullible but perfect candidates for deception.  This book might be good enough for them but that's okay by me.  The book certainly does not reveal god to us because it's only a book about mythology.  Precise example of a logical fallacy.  It wasn't god but the Greeks that said the righteous will live by faith, faith is believing in something you know isn't real.  That's the same level of circular reasoning I was talking about.  The bible most certainly has never been proven except some instances of history.  There is a reason to believe Josh and the bible, more money for guys like Josh.  So the claims he presents are most certainly false.  There is no other level of reasoning to buy this book or believe Josh.  Josh could certainly prove his case if god did reveal himself, but Josh and I both know that won't happen.  It's mythology we are talking about here. Mark_464@hotmail.com	2000-12-11

Thelma has outlined the blatant lies that are constantly  withdrawn from potential converts.  I recently ran into a missionary who  denied the fact of blacks holding priesthood roles until 1978.

Lewis	I will have to admit that the questions that immediatlely came to mind were answered somewhere later in the book.  So he does get credit for thinking like a skeptic.  However, he fails miserably at answering them.  You can't answer the questions about God by citing the same book you use to  believe he exists, the bible.  That's a logical fallacy, the only way you  know about god is to read the bible. If that book wouldn't have survived  the book burnings of the past, we would have millions less christians.  I  noticed some people referenced C.S. Lewis, a man who simply calls good-God.   That's all his writings are about, if it's good then it's from God.  I  think he's dyslexic or just makes typos on the word. If you read his  material and simply add the letter o, you read what good truly is, not  needing to say it's god but good.  Josh is just as simplistic.  He asserts  what God has said by using mostly the Bible.  You can't do that and expect  any kind of credibility.  Throw out the bible and most of this book has no  facts to back up his answers.  Several of the questions he answers he fully  admits there were councils who voted on what the bible should contain.  The  bible was written and edited by men, nothing to do with some inspired  being.  The Trinity, apocrypha and other chapters were voted on by men to  see if they were worthy of becoming the 66 books of the bible.  If anyone  considers this book a skeptical view of Christianity, they are already  Christian and Josh knows it sells many books, just like C.S. Lewis.  That's  no different than the idea of your church passing around the collection  plate, social acceptance sells and pays well.	2000-04-24

This is a book that my seven year old could really enjoy.  Childhood concepts of reality are acceptable until we become intelligent  enough to grasp adult society mentality.  Up to that point we are  conditioned by the virtues that Gordon implies we all can strive for in our  daily life, but face people who don't adhere to a universal standard.  I  tell my seven year old that everyday.  I then go to work and compare my  ethics to my supposed moral theistic colleagues which are less ethical than  myself for the most part.  We are conditioned to have these virtues our  parents instill by our altruistic nature.  The problem that lies in this  childish concept is that everyone thinks they are right. That is the second  side of our human nature, concern for self.  The 10 virtues that Gordon  delivers in his book are great for Mormons.  It's obvious that any body who  doesn't think highly of that religion has arguments against them and his  ideas they are to live by.  At what point do we agree that some of his  ideas could be used by all to some degree.  If a non-LDS conforms to his  ideas they have to admit that he has some truth to his version of  righteousness.  The same has to be said when an LDS conforms to others  virtues.  I think the idea about this book is that LDS can realize that  people don't have to agree with their leader, the message is acceptable and  not the messenger.  Please don't attack my review as some have done to  non-Mormons.  I am not an anti-mormon or have any axes to grind.  Those  cliches are heavily abused.	2000-04-14

The book was great because Ellie wasn't as meak and intimidated as Jody Foster portrayed in the movie.   Matt McCaunhey was just too quick in the movie with illogical retorts of  how all the information she was receiving could have been God.  I would  guess Sagan needed to feel the need to appeal to the theist to educate them  in their faulty logic.  I did like the ending of the movie in that Jody  Foster helped the next generation by telling the small group of children to  keep looking for answers.  The movie had an element of absolute farce,  Ellie saw her Dad who was dead.  The fact that time was an element did  entertain me.  We have created time and to see Elle travel through all  those visions in a few seconds, leaves me wandering what if we could  ultimately understand in outerspace.  Though we hardly fathom time travel  as factual, the intellectuals are working on making this a reality.  I mean  it's only been thirty years since we landed on the moon.  Could you imagine  telling your great-grandfather we will land on the moon?  He would have  said impossible.  Luckily our tax dollars are being used to explore science  projects despite all the opposition of people who think we are the center  of the Universe.  Sagan should be admired for his ability to make us think  of what we can attain through space exploration.  If I had to recommend one  over the other, read the book.	2000-04-11

This book explains how realistically the church is crumbling.  When the false prophet includes members that are dead, ie.  baptism of the dead.  Members that have been inactive for many years, the  membership numbers are highly exagerated.  The  long list of members also  includes people who have requested their names be removed, but the church  hesitantly resists this due to accurate disclosure and fear of fallout.   The book also explains why the missionaries are going to third world  countries, out of desperation.  Most Americans are knowledgable in this new  religion that proselytizing here is almost non-existant.  This book should  be required to all members of mormonism along with the BoM.

Jesus only existed in one place, the bible story.  The history of this man is what Dan eludes to.  There is no specific  record of a miraculous conception.  There either is a direct lie or jesus  was conceived in an evolutionary process.  The arguments that faith is  necessary leads that one must either believe in god or deny god.  Dan  illustrates how a lack of belief in god doesn't deny belief of actual  occurances in nature.  He still believes that most people are moral, as  they are in many countries without christianity.  Dan illustrates how  theories override faith.  A hope based on faith is completely different  than a scientific or philosophical theory.  Faith demands that you  understand it to the best of your ability and accept.  Theories have been  accurately changed as more knowledge is gained.  The theory of evolution  was originally introduced with critiques a mile long.  The missing link was  the supposed deficiency.  Now we have explored this knowledge and realized  adaption, micro-evolution, macro-evolution and god's big plan are really  evolution as theorized by Darwin and Wallace.  The natural selection  process may be called a belief system by a theist, when it really is  scientific knowledge.  Dan was just another person who realized that giving  in to a reward system made up for pyschological fulfillment. An avoidance  that the truth is when we die our reward can only be of what we left behind  in behavioral pattern and knowledge.  Thanks for the knowledge.	2000-01-21

It's so rational to explain to them the horrible mistakes Joseph Smith made in his self-righteous attempt to write a religious book.  The book is great  in being able to show the desperate used car salesman their attempts for  conversion is wasted on intelligent skeptics.  They have become so  desperate for growth because of the high inactive rates that they have to  send missionaries out and this book helps to keep people from falling into  the maze of Mormonism.  Most of the missionaries have been so blinded on  the history of the Mormon church that they don't know it is impossible for  it to be the true church.  The slitting of throats, special underwear and  polygamy  are concepts they won't even acknowledge because of the lies of  Mormon prophets.  Hopefully teaching them about what the church truly  teaches from this book will help to increase the inactive rates that  Christians find so comforting in helping the unfortunate missionaries.	1999-12-20

It gives nice examples of how the Book of Mormon was nothing more than his attempt to claim prestige.  I only gave it four stars  because it's hard to hurt a friends feelings.  Mormons are trying to be  wonderful people but are simply being told only the half-truths of their  leaders and the cults history.  The truth must be told and I recommend this  once someone is willing to stand by their side to recover from the Mormon  mental trap.	1999-11-18

An excellent guide for understanding the mind-control techniques of the cults in America.  Dr. Martin has done a great deal of research in discovering how the modern religions came about in the new world with  religious freedom.  After a brief insight with the Jehovah Witness and LDS  religion, the book becomes apparent of their doctrinal changes and  coverups.  It also serves as an excellent resource for the upcoming changes  that cults must use to retain their clean image while trying to recruit the  unknowing.  A great read for anyone trying to achieve morality and finding  the need to connect to a religion of control.  The book was published too  late to stop the plagurized doctrine of Joseph Smith and it examines the  Jehovah Witness with the non-scholastic intrepretors of their version of  the Christian Bible.  The book elaborates in detail of how the two cults  came to grow and why tolerance allowed them to remain.  A must read for  anyone losing a spouse or friend to the newest form of deviance, ignorance  of cult religions.	1999-09-13

Simple easy answers to why he changed certain &quot;beliefs&quot;.  His history of polygamy and treasure hunting  and these moral deficiencies and why they are to be allowed in his new  found religion.  The Christian/Mormon contradictions are easily seen in  this book.  The acknowledgment that Christian history has warned against  new gospels of men is another topic covered that allows the reader to  understand why the Book of Mormon is simply a man-made religion.  The  reason why Mormons want open acceptance of scripture interpretation which  allows Mormonism to attempt to show why this new religion is considered a  sect of Christianity, but fails.  This book explains why the two religions  have many similarities in Smiths attempt to rewrite the Bible.  The  mistakes he made are easily noted and verifiable.  A very good book to  recommend to people starting to see Mormons as Christians, whether newly  converted or an aged Mormon.  The underlying tone was friendly but not weak  as defending the Christian faith sometimes does to allow tolerance of new  religions.	1999-08-12

The extraction of the positive points in the Bible always seems to overlook the negative behavior.  Dan was a moral  person during his Christian times and will continue to be.  It is natural  instinct taught through societal and parental teaching.  Human natures is  instinctive to kindness, we don't need a fear of hell, we need to  understand consequences of bad behavior.  Dan is an supreme example of  human behavior without God.	1999-06-15
