These are the Hemingway and Fitzgerald wings of political novelization.<br />Fitzgerald was a member of the East Coast elite, the Ivy Leaguers of the Hamptons known as the &quot;idle rich.&quot; Hemingway represents a more red-blooded Midwesternism, tempered by the war and it phyical and mental horrors.<br />&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; describes a con man from the lower classes of Middle America who remakes himself. He achieves fabulous wealth in the heady early days of the Roaring 20s, at  time when the stock market was unregulated by the SEC and such things could be accomplished. In the manner of the Count of Monte Cristo, he makes a fantastic splash on High Society, a nouveau riche pretty boy, supposedly an officer in the Army during the Great War, who owns a huge Long Island mansion and holds enormous Summer parties.<br />The book centers on the angst of the idle rich, the love affairs of the morally ambiguous, people who must look for newer and more outrageous ways to tickle their fancies. Naturally, Gatsby's attractiveness among the gorgeous socialite women of the Hamptons stirs resentment among the old school boys, who question his validity.<br />Fitzgerald here describes a world from the standpoint of guilt; guilt at being rich. He paints a picture of people who have money without having earned it, who are not worthy of it in the entrepreneurial sense. This is an elite, liberal view - the opposite of the more hard-scrabble Hemingway world.<br />Political views aside, Fitzgerald is a fabulous writer who lends a distinct voice to the American literary scene. This is the proverbial Great American Novel.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<br />STWRITES@AOL.COM	2004-06-14

Lost in the McCarthy rhetoric, the underpinnings of conservatism were drowned out, but Buckley was and continues to be a voice that gives it reason.<br />The prescience of this book is in its dissection of liberalism on college campuses, and centers on the modernist swing away from God and towards Man. Buckley's best argument throughout the work  might be called the &quot;marketplace of ideas,&quot; which today conservatives are winning. He points out the political views of many of the families who send their kids to college, particularly Yale. Most of the parents are found to disagree with the new Leftist stridency of Yale and other colleges, but the parents have little if any choice in the matter of getting their children educated within a more balanced environment. This situation has not gotten better over the years. Reading &quot;God and Man At Yale&quot; teaches us that campus radicalism did not begin during the Vietnam War.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM	2004-06-14

My sense at this point is to look at the available empirical evidence. George W. Bush was admitted to Yale and graduated in four years. He was a legacy, so getting in was assured, but many students do not graduate in four years, as he did. This is to his credit. His grades have not been released, but most of those who were there say he was about a B- student, which is quite respectable.<br />Next, he entered the U.S. Air Force, their version of the Reserves, which in his case was the Texas Air Guard. Perhaps he received some favoritism over others in getting a slot, but the evidence is he did not. The fact is, he was willing to \\"go jets,\\" which few were willing or qualified to try out for. Bush went through a series of rigorous tests and passed them. He entered flight school, where the \\"wash out\\" rate is about 80 percent. He passed. He entered flight test, where the wash out rate is quite high. He passed. He qualified and flew jets. Here is the thing: People make movies and write books about this experience. \\"The Right Stuff\\", \\"Top Gun\\", \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\" are all about exceptional young men who walk this trial by fire. Bush is one of them. He is a Top Gun - no, not the actual guys who are selected for Miramar by the Navy, not a Blue Angel, not Chuck Yeager, but he is one of an elite group of awesome Americans. <br />When Fleet Week comes around, and I see these pilots walking around town, my first reaction is that by virtue of having those wings they are top flight individuals, outstanding people. I do not ask whether they flew in combat or missed some drills. I know if they are wearing that uniform and have those wings they are studs. Bush was one of those men.<br />Apparently Bush missed a few drills in 1973 after five years in the Air Force. I was in the Reserves and missed some drills. Everybody misses drilloccasionally, for a million valid reasons, none of which means we were AWOL. Bush was never AWOL.<br />One other thing. Bush never flew in Vietnam, but I bet he is glad of this. Had he, no doubt his detractors would say he dropped napalm on villages and killed civilians. <br />Bush applied to the University of Texas Law School and was turned down. So much for having every door opened to him because of his \\"daddy,\\" who had been a Texas Congressman and two-time Texas Senate candidate. Bush applied to the Harvard Business School. Guess the percentage of people who are not accepted. 80 percent? 90? Point made. <br />Bush was accepted. He was not a Harvard legacy. It would appear he got in on merit, being a Yale grad of good grades and a fighter pilot. Their conclusion: This guy has an impressive background. He studied the courses, and graduated with an MBA. How many enter the MBA program and wash out? Many do.<br />Accordingly to the not-Republican Atlantic Monthly, Bush has never lost a political debate. He has squared off with some tough characters, like Ann Richards and Al Gore.<br />Dumb? This issue has has been studied and analyzed. The conclusion? Bush is no dummy.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\" <BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM	2004-06-14

Dostoevsky came from an aristocratic family and served in the military, but gave up all that this promised him in the post-Napoleonic years to write full time.<br />The most telling section in &quot;Brothers&quot;, in my view, is the conversation between Christ and the old priest during the Spanish Inquisition. This is very telling as it pertains to the &quot;new&quot; view of the Catholic church, a fallout of reformation, the Inquisition, and a re-thinking of Christianity. My feeling is that Islam would be well served and possibly saved if a modern Dostoevsky woulde emerge from its ranks.<br />When Christ forgives the evil old priest, a Satanic figure really, this is as true a view of real Christianity as any. The pomp and circumstance of Catholicism, the tortures and abuses, fade away in the blinding light of Christ's foregiveness and love.

I feel that his best work is &quot;East of Eden&quot;, but &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a monumental work, probably the one that captures his political sensibilities and the times he wrote about better than any. &quot;Grapes&quot; has character development, pathos, irony and social commentary, all biting, poignant and loving at the same time. Its political message is Socialist. The problem with this is that it offers great misery, packaged in the plight of the Joad family and Okies headed to California during the Dust Bowl '30s, but it does not offer solutions. Business owners, capitalists, policemen and authority figures are fairly evenly displayed as unfeeling, selfish, sometimes racist, and mean.<br />What Steinbeck chose not to do was to see the 1930s from their standpoint. The message would seem to indicate that he advocated that the government just handle all the Okies' problems, but this creates some problems. First, the FDR Administration did more in this regard than any previous government, or any since, possibly. With this in mind, then the question devolves into the conclusion that government intervention is not the answer.<br />The question I kept asking was, Why do roadside business owners or cops or others barely struggling during terrible times owe something to these Okies? From the Christian standpoint, they do. But the Okies had no job skills. They offered little. They were not marketable. They were willing to work, but they could not do anything other than manual labor.<br />It is easy to criticize them for coming to California where there were more people than jobs, but they apparently were coerced into it by misleading flyers advertising fruit waiting to be picked and jobs aplenty.<br />In the light of historical retrospect, the unsaid message of this book at its time was that the people described would be &quot;saved&quot; if they lived in Communism. Those who flirted with Communism in America in the 1930s can be excused, considering the times. But Steinbeck was an educated man, and by the time he finished this book, the basic facts about Stalin's Russia were known. Russia was in shambles, millions had already been murdered, starved and imprisoned. It was hell on Earth. Steinbeck had to know, if not every gory detail, enough to establish the fact that Communism was utterly evil.<br />This left him, it seems, between a rock and a hard place, which was the big problem for all the Communists and fellow travelers in the West. The Utopian ideal does not adhere to reality. In the end, &quot;Grapes&quot; describes misery and plays to guilt, a powerful strategy.<br />What history tells us is that the &quot;answer&quot; to the Okies' predicament, while not perfect, while not timely, was in the end the fact that they lived in America, which to paraphrase Chuirchill is &quot;the worst country known to man with the exception of all other countries known to man.&quot;<br />To live in America offered more hope and more chance of success to these people than all other Earthly possibility. Steinbeck does not portray that. He does not necessarily deserve to be excoriated for it; it would require perhaps more vision than he had in light of his publication and probable editorial time constraints. However, travel the California landscape today and one will find the children and grandchildren of these Okies, and they will mainly tell you stories of struggle that ended in various forms of happiness and success for the ancestors of the Okies.<br />Despite any political differences, Steinbeck is a writer of such talent and inner greatness that it cannot be denied.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<br />STWRITES@AOL.COMrica in the 1930s can be excused, considering the times.

To any modern athlete who thinks of himself as an iconoclast, a funnyman, an intellectual, a wit - whether it be Jason Williams, Barry Zito, Michael Irvin, Charles Barkley, you name it, I say that I knew Bill Lee. I worked with Bill Lee. Bill Lee is a friend of mine, and you are no Bill Lee. This is no put down of those who are not the Spaceman. It is an ode to Lee. I love this character.<br />This is as funny a book as has ever been written about baseball. It is so unique, so California New Age, so filled with Boston baseball lore and Ruthian curse that reading it is just one big pleasure cruise. Lee is in the tradition of Casey Stengel and Rod Dedeaux, whose lineage he follows. <br />Lee's aunt was the main character described in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. This is a guy surrounded by men's men growing up (his old man, his Uncle Grover), yet it is his aunt who taught him how to pitch. Amazingly, I know most of Bill's family, and they are Ed McMahon to Bill's Carson. His father was a straight arrow phone company exec. His aunt just smiles at Bill's buffoonery. She pitched a perfect game in the women's pro league on June 6, 1944 and, when asked if events of that day distracted her, she just said she had the ability to focus.<br />Recently Spaceman told an audience that &quot;I don't believe in killing anybody, but the Unabomber had some good ideas.&quot; Like Hunter Thompson, here is a guy whose politics are the polar opposite of mine, yet I just dig the man.<br />If you grew up in the San Fernando Valley or Marin County, went to USC (particularly when Dedeaux coached there), or matriculated at Fenway Park, this book will tickle your jones for those memories. Lee is the closest guy I can think of (outside of George Patton) to making me think reincarnation is possible. I see him as a court jester of Camelot, always funny, always taking the minority view and making you shake your head - and smile.<br />I once had Bill as a guest at my home. At 6 A.M. I went towake him, and he was gone. I looked out my window and Space was doing Tai-Kwan do with my 119-year old Chinese neighbor, a guy who probably was the emperor's body guard in 1880. I took Space to work. At a law office, I was in conference when the secretary came in yelling to &quot;call 911. A guy's having a heart attack in the parking lot.&quot; I looked out the window. Space was doing his afternoon Tai-kwan do. I asked Space to meet me and my SC baseball buddies at the 501 Club in L.A. that night. The guys were all there, skeptical that Space would show. He showed and drank beer with us all night, filling us with stories. When a Doors song came on the juke Space announced, &quot;My brother got stabbed at a Doors concert once.&quot; Survived. Space made nice-nice with an SC cutie, regaling her with stories about the 1968 College World Series vs. the Southern Illinois Salukis. Only Space could have captured some chick's attention with memories of the Southern Illinois Salukis. You had to be there. <br />Space spoke to the Orange County Young Republicans when he was running for President on Canada's Rhino ticket in 1988. The YRs were aghast at Space filling their precious speaker's rostrum until he took stage and had these buttoned-down types - and I do not exaggerate here - literally rolling in the aisles with laughter. Space in front of a crowd is up there with Carlin or Robin Williams.<br />These anecdotes are a typical example of what is in his autobiography.

There is something about New York City, the 1950s, and the Brooklyn Dodgers that contributed to the axiom that the best sportswriting is baseball writing. Angell is it, in its purest form. Jaques Barzun, a French writer, visited America around the turn of the century to discover what de Toqueville had found some 70 years earlier. Barzun concluded that, &quot;In order to know America, you have to know baseball.&quot; To a current generation of young baseball enthusisasts who want to grasp what an older generation felt about this game, I recommend &quot;The Summer Game&quot; above all others. &quot;Five Seasons&quot; might be next, but &quot;The Summer Game&quot; is the best of the lot. It carries forward from Angell's 1950s experiences, and is part of his reportage for The New Yorker. Somehow he infuses the high art literacy necessary for a publication of this sort with the most lyrical, dead-on anlaysis of baseball ever. He starts with the 1962 Mets, and covers them over several Casey Stengel Polo Grounds seasons. No description ever conveys the wackiness of those lovable losers better, or the old-style devotion of New York fans of the by-gone era. This is the Brooklyn Dodger contingent transferred to Polo and Shea. Angell covers the '67 Red Sox, the '68 World Series (McClain vs Gibson overshadowed by Lolich), the Amazin' Mets, the Bay Area in their season of two division champs (1971), and other events, always including the World Series' played between '62 and '71. His writing about Dodger Stadium and Dodger fans in 1966 demonstrates the best of the &quot;new age&quot; Los Angeleno baseball enthusiasts, the modernists if you will. It describes vividly how an era has turned. He paints a picture of a beautiful new stadium bathed in Califrnia sunlight that is pure romanticism. To a young California reader, as I once was, it was the most perfect imagery. <br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM	2004-06-11

Bill &quot;Spaceman&quot; Lee once told a conservative political audience that &quot;I'm so conservative I eat road kill&quot; and &quot;I'm so conservative I'm standing back-to-back with Chairman Mao.&quot; Funny? Doesn't seem that way, but you never heard such laughter as responded to Lee's delivery. The same goes for my love affair with the writing of Hunter S. Thompson. You could walk the fruited plain from California to the New York Island and not find somebody more different from Thompson than me. Thompson would read my opinions and pronounce that I am an &quot;enemy of the people.&quot; If I spent a weekend at his cabin in Woody Creek, however, we'd find common ground. I'm an absolute Reagan conservative, a total Christian, a flag-waving American patriot, an admirer of the military (particularly George Patton), a devotee of law'n'order...and a giant fan of Jim Morrison and Thompson!<br />&quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; is so brilliant, so funny, so biting in its commentary, so revolutionary that I cannot do it justice herein. Thompson is just plain awesome. An insane writer, in the admirable as well as the literal sense.<br />How to describe this book? &quot;The '60s meets the John Birch Society&quot;? &quot;The American Dream meets the American nightmare&quot;? I don't have it in me to analyze Hunter. He's too good, too out there. Just admiration, that's all I have left for him. The only thing left is mystique, because Thompson, despite years of stories and in-depth analyses, is still very much unknown. Can he be the guy he describes and survive? The truth, or the Truth as Hunter might call it, is that he probably is putting on a little act, but it is just questionable enough to leave doubt, or Doubt!<br />I think Thompson is what Michael Moore wishes he was.   <br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM	2004-06-11

I am a conservative Reaganite. I thought Dick Nixon a brilliant President. I think the Lord Jesus Christ saves my soul. Whereas I despise Michael Moore and do not think he speaks the truth, I admire Hunter Thompson, who is probably a lot closer to Moore's politics than mine. It is not just the passage of time that heals divisions, it is more than that. If I were to analyze Hunter's political nostrums, I would probably find much that I know to be wrong, and that Hunter had enough education and knowledge available to him to know it was wrong but he wrote it anyway. Still, whatever visceral reaction I have to Moore I do not have for Hunter.<br />I guess humnor must be why. Hunter is absolutely inconoclastic. He is side-splitting. He never smiles, and his writing has no funniness in it. I picture him writing out of dread and hate, yet it magically transforms itself into laughs when my eyes meet his words and transfer to my brain. Forgive my bad attempt to get into his head and \\"explain\\" Hunter. It's all I can do to try.<br />This book is phenomenal. It contains events that are different from any descriptions ever. Others have novelized reality, but nobody splits the difference like Hunter. Hunter's supposed on-scene reportage of Edmund Muskie coming unglued in the New Hampshire snow, Frank Mankiewiczs' furious (drug induced?) ramblings, the one-on-one with Nixon himelf, leaves the reader exhausted in an effort to separate reality from fantasy. Hunter is like the great con man who uses Truth to augment his lies. This is not calling Hunter a liar, it is just an example. The fact that I don't see this as lies is telling, and separates Hunter and his times from the current political climate, in which his spawn, if you will, the likes of Moore and Al Franken, try to make Hunteresque points but leave themselves exposed as obfuscators instead. The answer is that Thompson is just so much better than almost all other writers that he cannot be duplicated or even imitated. To try is pointless. Many, inclduing myself, have tried to be the \\"next Jim Murray,\\" but like Murray nobody can be Hunter, either.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS(...)	2004-06-11

Roger Angell's first work covered events before I was aware of them and then those that occurred in my most formative, fanatical, baseball-crazy years. &quot;Five Seasons&quot; describes years in which I was still a huge baseball fan (I always have been and always will be), but they are all events I witnesed. For this reason, and because as I grew older my interests - girls, cars, awareness, life - changed, so too does my impression of Angell's writing. Do not take this as any kind of put down. To a younger reader who did not witness the events in &quot;Five Seasons&quot;, I assure you that Angell's writing can fill you with wonder as much as &quot;The Summer Game&quot; did for me. It has been said, and I agree here, that baseball is the preferred game of intellectuals, or at least educated people. Nobody embodies this reality better than Angell and his writings.<br />STEVEN TRAVERS<BR>AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STWRITES@AOL.COM	2004-06-11

It is based on the theory that a child is best raised by a caring community. Within its pages are many well-intentioned statements that advocate the beauty of a world in which children are provided all that they need - education, health care, love and caring. To discredit it requires generalizing, which is never a good idea (but sometimes impossible to avoid), and to \\"put down\\" the idea that providing for kids is a good thing. Of course it is a good thing.<br />The problem starts with Hillary Clinton, who speaks often about \\"the children.\\" An overall assessment of Hillary - her background, her marriage and partnership with Bill Clinton, Hillarycare, the accusations against her and the inside stories of those who knew her best in Little Rock and D.C., are that her real desire is not to further the betterment of kids, but of her hold on power in America. She uses kids as a smokescreen in this effort. There is no arguing some of the things she advocates are good ideas, and so judging her and this book requires a Kabuki dance between truth and politics. This is what obfuscators are good at creating.<br />There is a conservative opposition to Hillary's book, some of whom call it \\"It Takes A Village Idiot\\", which is based on the idea that raising kids is the job of parents, not the state. This is of course correct, but again requires generalizing. To advocate it blindly discredits the role of teachers, Foster parents, neighbors and social workers. Sometimes there are no biological parents around. The health care issue is a big one, and is easy to jump on. It sounds good, of course, to say that all kids should have health care. We live in a country in which they all do not. However, the Canadian-style Hillarycare that was so roundly defeated a decade ago is not the answer. It was explored inside and out at the time and found to be totally lacking as practical application.<br />What we are left after Hillarycare is just Hillary. She is smart and knows how to pull our heartstrings. Watch out for her.(...)Hillary. She is smart and knows how to pull our heartstrings. Watch out for her.(...)	2004-06-10

He writes about superstars like Tom Seaver, playboys like Bo Belinsky, hardthrowing drunks like Steve Dalkowski, 6-6 lefties who never lived up their potential, like Sam McDowell, and prep phenoms from his home state of Connecticut who met the same fate as the author.<br />Jordan's talent is not one that can be learned in a literary class.

Aside from his good character, his economic triumphs and patriotism, it comes down to a theory that I came up with after hearing Margaret Thatcher say he won the Cold War \\"without firing a shot.\\" First, it entails an analysis of World War II, in which some 50 to 60 million people died, yet the world says it was worth it to defeat Hitler and Japan. This leads to my theory, which is based on the unfought World War III. Say this struggle was fought between freedom, led by the U.S., and Communism, led by the U.S.S.R., between 1983 and 1989. Say that during this period, 50 to 60 million people died, and the world was caught up in an Apocalypse just as terrible as the one fought in the 1940s. Say that, through better technology, leadership, military doctrine, and with the help of God, the U.S. wins World War III. Say further that the political fallout of the war is exactly and precisecly that with which actually happened in 1989-91. I say that had it happened this way, the world would again say it was worth it, to defeat Communism. Reagan did it without firing a shot, and this is why I love him so much. Furthermore, in an ironic twist, Bill Clinton owes much of his success to Reagan. The Republicans were victims of their own success in 1992.

He said that if not, nobody would believe it, and it would not be remembered. Thus, the Holocaust is memorialized and detailed for history.<br />Jewish Nazi hunters echo the cry, \\"Never again,\\" but alas, history does repeat itself. Some might even say it rhymes. International Communism is responsible for the murder of 100 million human beings in roughly 72 years, in the U.S.S.R., China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Cuba, East Germany and throughout the Warsaw Pact countries. 12 million died in the Holocaust, 50-60 million in WWII.<br />Then there are the genocides in Rwanda, Congo, by Idi Amin and other despots, and it all just keeps comin'. Absent camera crews like the ones Ike ordered turned on, it just flies right past our radar. Somehow, Communism is this dinosaur of the Cold War. To call somebody a Communist just has no real bite anymore, whereas to call somebody a Nazi is the worst insult. If we do not wake up and understand that evil exists, then we are doomed to just re-live it over and over again. Until it rhymes.<br />This a great book that makes the attempt to turn the light of Truth on some of the worst crimes ever committed, but I am afraid it is only read by those, like me, who already know about it.

Books	1	13	36	N	N	IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE	The double standard of Political Correctness may have some validity insofar as it is a response to past injustices, mostly of the racial variety, but for Michael Moore to title his book \\"Stupid White Men\\" leaves him open, in my view, to as much criticism as I would rightly receive had I written a book called \\"Dumbellionite Negroes\\". The easy put-down of Moore is to say something like, \\"It takes one to know one,\\" but in all fairness, Moore is not stupid. Furthermore, conservatives such as myself love to tout the \\"marketplace of ideas,\\" because it is in this free discourse of Democracy where we succeed, whether it be talk radio, best selling books, Fox News, the rising tide of country music vs. Hollywood's recent failures, or the simple fact that Republicans now dominate the White House, the Congress, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures. We must begrudgingly accept the fact, however, that Moore is the exception to this rule. He succeeds. He is rich. He is popular. Therefore, to dispute him requires some intellectuial honesty.<br />In the bad old days, the bigots might call Moore a \\"traitor to his race.\\" More appropriately, he might be considered a traitor to his class, because his arguments seem based on a refutation of the middle class system that many of us strongly believe makes America great, and we assume it is this \\"class\\" from which Moore emerges from. What  we think makes America great is something Moore thinks is lousy. Does this make him anti-American and unpatriotic? Again, to say so is the easy way out.<br />The best way to dispute Moore is not to put him down, but to make an honest argument on behalf of America. To put things in sports terms, think of him as a guy who grows up in New York City and hates the Yankees. He has access to all the information about how the Yankees are the greatest dynasty in sports history, and is surrounded by admirers and fanatics of the team, yet he chooses to hate what represents him.<br />Moore emerges from what I call the \\"Emma Goldman school of anarchy.\\" In the old days, guys like Moore would be dismissed as Communists and Socialists. Now that Communism has been defeated, most people do not even remember much about the ideology responsible for the murder of 100 million human beings in roughly 72 years. Calling somebody a Communist has little effect any more. So the Moore's of this world can no longer find comfort in Moscow. They no longer carry posters of Chairman Mao. What they are left with is a vague hatred for the winners, the powerful, the champions of history. In essence, the winners of history are America and Christianity. Anarchism, as espoused by Emma Goldman during World War I, is a mindset that never really goes away. In a free country it is free to be voiced, and Moore voices it.     <br />As for America's role in the world, we have little choice but to lead. America is the most powerful empire in the history of Mankind. What some call the \\"shifting sands\\" under our power is in fact our most legitimate strength, which is Democracy. The barbs, complaints and open criticisms of America are our greatest accompolishments, the most obvious examples of how we do it better and cleaner than any previous power. Imagine, for instance, a U.N. demanding an investigation into the Roman Empire's crucifixion of the Rabbi Christ; or demands on the floor of the U.N. for Britain to leave India circa 1890. <br />Which brings us back to Michael Moore. Moore has access to all the information that tells anybody willing to accede to the slightest version of Truth that America is the greatest nation ever conceived by God, yet he chooses only to criticize it. In the end, his criticisms make the U.S. stronger, because the fact that he is wrong yet still free as a bird to publicly be wrong becomes known to all, thus giving America greater legitimacy through a constant \\"trial by fire.\\" Still, Moore deserves some judgment. What it comes down to is that he says things that are not true,while surely he possesses enough education and access to Truth to know they are not true. There is a word for this, and the fact that this word applies to Moore is knowledge we possess.	2004-06-01

The Hollywood Left is part of the dominant media culture, all of which is liberal. This includes the world of cinema, television, network news, major newspapers and magazines. At one time they controlled all the media this nation heard and saw, which is why somebody like Walter Cronkite was so \\"trusted.\\" There were no alternatives to Cronkite. Today the right has a niche, which includes talk radio, country music and a few newspapers and magazines. Fox News is not conservative, but because it is fair and actually roots for America, it seems conservative in comparison to its counterparts. Wherever conservative and patriotic media go head to head with the Left, conservativism and patriotism win. Hollywood loses power. Their movies have less influence, the Oscars get lousy ratings, and people mock their most outspoken anti-Americanism. <br />Hollywood does not learn from \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" or even \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". If they produced outright conservative films they would be enormous successes. There is a huge audience of conservatives who do not pay to see movies because they are tired of the old liberal slant. For instance, if Hollywood ever did a film that depicted, for one instance, how John Kennedy stole the 1960 election from Richard Nixon; or perhaps a story about a Democrat politicican who has rivals and witneses to his crimes murdered a la a certain Arkansas politician - conservative word of mouth would spread like wildfire.<br />How come we never see movies that depict the murder of 100 million human beings under Communism? We see plenty of Nazi and Holocaust movies, which is fine, but Communism was just as bad and even more deadly. Could it be because the Communists were embedded in the Democrat party until McCarthyism rooted them out? Could it be becausedown deep, many liberals like Communism, they just think it was a good idea gone wrong? A movie like \\"Schindler's List\\" set in the Soviet Gulags could be just as powerful. The Left cannot admit how awful Communism was because they gave aid and comfort to Communism during the Vietnam War. Now they are more liberal than ever? Why? Because Communism has been defeated and forgotten by the average citizen. Liberals no longer have to worry about being associated with it. There are, however, those of us who read and remember who know the facts about these people.<br />Now we are engaged in the War on Terrorism. The Left is slowly but surely gravitating to the terrorists because they no longer have Communism to admire any more. They hate American power and success, so they find themselves increasingly opposing America and admiring those who hate us.  (...)	2004-05-12

Chambers most likely would have faded into obscurity, but for a chain of events and a few patriots. FDR did not pay heed to the accusation that Communists had infiltrated his government, but Naval intelligence intercepted word that Joseph Stalin was planning a separate peace with Adolf Hitler. The Navy did not trust the Democrats. They devised the Venona project, intercepting Soviet cables, and discovered that Chambers was right about Hiss. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover refused to go public with Venona (not opened until the 1990s), because the on-going intercepts were too important to be exposed. But he told the right political people. The case went to HUAC, led by the young California Congressman, Richard Nixon. The Left excoriated Chambers. Hoover refused to shed light on Venona, letting the wheels of justice grind on their own terms. Hiss was proven right. Nixon became the first hero of conservatism. McCarthyism followed, and sides were taken.<br />(...)	2004-04-15

The story revolves around Herrick &quot;Harry&quot; Hubbard. Harry was raised to become a crack CIA agent. His father is a career Company man, and he comes under the wing of his Godfather and mentor, Hugh Tremont Montague (bases on James Jesus Angleton). Montague, also known as Harlot, shepherds him through the Ivy League and into the cloistered, early 1950s world of the Central Intelligence Agency. A battle for Harry's &quot;soul&quot; occurs between his father and Harlot.<br />Harry falls in love with the beautiful and redoubtable Kitteredge, who has also come under Harlot's spell. Kitteredge becomes a CIA psycho-analyst, charged with getting to the root of male-female differences by studying the Alpha and Omega of human personality. She marries the older Harlot, and has a long affair with Harry, all of it supposedly kept &quot;secret&quot; from Harlot.<br />Harry matures into a top CIA operative. His station assignments take him to Latin America, where the Company orchestrates political overthrows and fights a desperate propaganda war against Communist insurgents. The CIA in the 1950s is composed of pipe-smoking, tweed-coated Ivy Leaguers obsessed with defeating atheistic Marxist-Stalinists in every corner of the globe. They go by a staunch code of Episcopalian Christianity, convinced beyond all doubt that they fight on the side of good against the worst possible evil. They are the new Church of America, where the secrets are kept.<br />Harry's assignments range from Latin America to Berlin to Washington, D.C. to the Bay of Pigs. He works closely with real-life historical figures, such as Watergate &quot;plumber&quot; E. Howard Hunt. He is directed to start an affair with a beautiful femme fatale based on Judith Campbell Exner, and becomes a CIA liaison/spy between the Company, John F. Kennedy and a Sam Giancana character.<br />Eventually, Kitteredge divorces Harlot and marries Harry. Harlot dies in mysterious circumstances, just as Harry is learning of a nefarious plot to assassinate President Kennedy. His failed attempts to get to the bottom of the assassination plans before they are carried out, mixed with his &quot;taking&quot; the young wife from his mentor, represent the loss of innocence in an end-of-Camelot scenario.	2004-04-03

It, and its author, have been vilified and deified. Reviewing this book is as challenging as it was reading all 1168 of its pages. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is truly a &quot;piece of work.&quot; It is a triumph of philosophy, much more so than the quintessential &quot;great American novel.&quot; The greatness of this book is in its ideas more so than its literary value. Rand is not a writer on par with Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, or Thomas Wolfe. However, she is a visionary, like her hero, Aristotle. Her fans are fans of her vision, not just her words, and she has spawned millions of them over the years.<BR> &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; was Ronald Reagan's favorite novel. It was the most influential book William F. Buckley, Jr. ever read. Obviously, this gives away its premise, which is conservative in nature and therefore anathema to liberals and the literary establishment they control. &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and Rand herself were shoved into second-tier status by college professors and bookstore chains, but long before talk radio, she proved that conservatives win in the marketplace of ideas. Her works have been international best sellers for decades. Clubs, forums, seminars, web sites, and chat rooms devoted to Rand have given her legions of loyal supporters a chance to ask and get answers to the many, many questions that her novels have inspired. For years, Rand toured the country, delighting audiences who seemed to literally worship her. Following her own novel, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and influential non-fiction books &quot;God and Man At Yale&quot; by Buckley, and Whittaker Chambers' essential &quot;Witness&quot; (1952), &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; gave impetus to the conservative movement, which broke from the Rockefeller wing of the Republican party to launch Barry Goldwater's Quixote-like 1964 campaign; eventually the Reagan Revolution; and finally the sea change which promises to make the first half of the 21st Century an era of unparalleled American power.<BR>  <BR>Steven Travers is the author of &quot;Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman&quot; ([...] He can be reached at STWRITES@aol.com.	2004-04-03

He also held to the mantra of his era: &quot;Don't trust anyone over 30.&quot;<br />Chapin and Prugh were over 30, albeit just barely.<br />As a kid growing up in Marin rooting for Cal, the A's and the Raiders, &quot;the book&quot; opened my eyes to the outside world. &quot;The Wizard of Westwood&quot; was not just a sports book, but also a book about American society during the turbulent 1960s and early 1970s. It just happened to be written through the prism of UCLA basketball.<br />It is ostensibly a biography of legendary UCLA coach John Wooden. It is provocative, where Wooden's autobiography, &quot;They Call Me Coach&quot;, is vanilla. I recently had a chance to speak to Chapin and Prugh.<br />&quot;I was going to write a book &lt;I&gt;with&lt;/I&gt; Wooden, and he had agreed to,&quot; says Chapin. &quot;I was sitting in his office with him and my book agent, and had actually signed the contract. When he had the pen in his hand, he stopped, and said, `No, I think I want to wait until I'm finished coaching to do this.' <br />&quot;When we started digging deeper into things, we heard that John got scared of what he heard we were going to say, and decided to write his own book.&quot;<br />&quot;Digging deeper&quot; meant going into the subject of Sam Gilbert, an infamous Bruin booster who arranged abortions and payoffs for players.<br />Did Wooden know details about Gilbert?<br />As a former Los Angeles sportswriter, I dug into this subject myself. An impeccable source,very highly placed in the UCLA Athletic Department and in a position to know, told me flat out, &quot;Wooden knew. He had to know.&quot;<BR>* * *<BR>&quot;I took Bill Walton to lunch at a steakhouse on Wilshire Boulevard,&quot; recalls Chapin. &quot;He was so self-conscious about his height then that he insisted we get a table way in back of the restaurant, where it was very dark and we wouldn't be noticed. We talked for a couple of hours, off the record. A few days later, Vic Kelley, the UCLA sports information director, told me he was not going to do any more interviews.&quot;<br />Obviously, somebody &quot;got to&quot; Walton. His natural distrust of authority did not make it hard to convince him to clam up with the press.<br />&quot;I think Sam Gilbert told him not to talk to us,&quot; opined Chapin. &quot;I never talked to him directly again at any point in his UCLA career. Later, when Walton played for Portland, I was at a UCLA-Oregon State game, when I felt a hand tap me on the shoulder. It was Walton, who said, `How are you doing, Dwight?' I said, `Fine, Bill, but I don't have time to talk to you right now.' Amazing that you can't shut the guy up now.&quot;<BR>* * *<BR>&quot;UCLA was not insulated from the outside world,&quot; says Prugh. &quot;When you stepped on campus you were exposed to all the socio-political cross-currents of that era. Wooden was a man from rural Indiana, and of an older generation, but he had a social conscience.<br />&quot;Lew Alcindor &lt;later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&gt; discerned that about Wooden,&quot; continues Prugh. &quot;Lew said no white American could know what it is like to be black, but Wooden had as close an understanding of the issue as he could.<br />&quot;Curtis Rowe said Wooden did not see color, just players. The players of that era were the first to express other than one-dimensional views of the world. Therefore, we no longer saw them as just stats, but as humans with frailties. TV forced newspapers to show us the `how and why.' <br />When Prugh walked the Berkeley campus during road trips, his short hair made him look like an FBI agent to the Cal students.<br />The draft was going on, but the UCLA players did not talk about it, according to Prugh, although they were &quot;almost all opposed to the war. From 1968-73, there was mounting dissatisfaction with the way institutions were run. Woodstock was big, Nixon went to China, then Watergate happened.<br />The radical Walton clashed with his coach in those days. Now he is part of The Establishment and calls him &quot;My hero John Wooden.&quot; Chapin and Prugh, meanwhile, represent fascinating windows into the most interesting and important period in American history since the Civil War.	2004-02-23

Then there are great sports books that make pretty good films, as is the case with Peter Gent's North Dallas 40.  The 1978 film, starring Nick Nolte, was about as good as sports movies got in that era.  Subsequent efforts have raised the bar, but despite some hokiness, good acting and story development hold it up. <br />North Dallas 40 followed the same pattern as Semi-Tough, depicting in semi-fictional manner the intertwining of football, manhood and Texas.  These are probably the two best football novels ever written; both are raw,  funny and sexy.  North Dallas 40 takes the story one step further, by introducing tragedy and pathos.  Today, every Tom, Dick and Harry loves to pretend they know The Bard, and would say this book was Shakespearean.  I would not go that far, but it is good!  Finally, North Dallas 40 is the third of the great \\"tell-all\\" sports books of the 1970s.  Before North and Semi, there was Jim Bouton's Ball Four.   <br />North Dallas 40 unsuccessfully tries to pass off an opening disclaimer that the characters are fictional.  Forget about it.  Phil Elliott is Peter Gent, a Dallas Cowboy's wide receiver in the 1960s.  B.A. is Tom Landy, the Cowboys legendary coach.  Seth Maxwell is Don Meredith, their quarterback from 1960 to 1968 (some tried to say he was Craig Morton, but he is \\"Dandy Don\\").  Thomas Richardson is Duane Thomas, the surly black militant Dallas running back and star of the 1972 Super Bowl.  Conrad Hunter is straight-arrow owner Clint Murchison, Art Hartman is Roger Staubach, and Jo Bob Williams is probably Bob Lilly.    <br />It is a simple enough tale of a week in Elliott's life, preparing with his team for a pivotal game against Fran Tarkenton's New York Giants at Yankee Stadium (circa 1969).  Elliott is a rebel, a malcontent, a non-conformist, a drug addict, an alcoholic, a bi-curious womanizer, an atheist, maybe a Communist, and a clutch wide receiver.  He is appealing in that \\"bad boy\\" way that we love dark characters, like Paul Newman in \\"Hud\\".  He is having an affair with the fiancée of the owner's younger brother, all the while soothing his terrible aches and bodily pains with a variety of pills, booze and pot.  His pot-smoking partner is Maxwell.  <br />B.A. is a straight-arrow Christian who cannot understand why everybody cannot be like that.  He also has no personal feelings for his players, all of whom he motivates by mixing an even dose of  fear, loathing, intimidation and pain.  Much of Landry's \\"plastic computer coach\\" reputation stemmed from this book.  Maxwell is not anybody's friend, but rather a totally self-centered genius leader on a football field.  Elliott gets hooked up with the lovely Charlotte Caulder, and after the loss to the Giants, he is ex-communicated from the club for smoking pot.  Maxwell's pot smoking is conveniently overlooked.  Elliott's real crime is sleeping with the fiancée of Conrad's brother.  <br />In the book, when he returns to Charlotte, he finds that she and her black lover have been killed in a grisly love triangle murder.  The film, featuring the brooding Nolte at his anti-social best, and an excellent \\"good ol' boy\\" performance from Davis, steers from this hole and leaves us with the memory of Phil as victim of corporate hypocrisy.<br />Semi-Tough is much lighter, filled with sex, semi-macho Texas homilies, and Jenkins at his pure funniest.  It is the story of three childhood friends.  Billy Clyde Puckett (Reynolds) and Shake Tiller (Kristoferson) are superstar football players with the New York Giants who played together in high school in Ft. Worth, Texas, then at T.C.U..  Barbara Jane Bookman has been with them every step of the way since kindergarten.  The film is destroyed by Clayburgh's portrayal.  In the book, she is described as Pamela Anderson fine.  In 1975 Loni Anderson might have cut the mustard.  Okay, her character had depth, so they needed an actress, but Clayburgh was semi-pretty at the very best.  The idea that men would fall for her in the manner required is ludicrous. <br />The book succeeds because it can meander in and out of Billy Clyde's fervent imagination, making full use of his storytelling skills.  Billy Clyde describes writing Semi-Tough while Jenkins writes Semi-Tough, all during the week leading up to the Giants Super Bowl match-up with the Jets at the Los Angeles Coliseum.  <br />Films, which require a tight, three-act structure, fail when they meander, as this one does.  All the sight gags that Jenkins has the reader rolling in the aisles over are duds on the screen.  Nevertheless, three out of four ain't bad.	2004-02-23

He was to the written word what Stradivarius was to the violin, Patton to the tank, Aristotle to philosophy.<br />Jim Murray did not pen what he wrote, he conjured it up. No mere mortal could come up with the stuff he did. <br />He never met hyperbole he did not like.<br />USC, coming from behind against Notre Dame, was not just a football team. They were the Wehrmacht marching on Poland. Sherman burning Atlanta. <br />A big game was not just a big game, it was the Roman Legion vs. Hannibal, Grant taking Richmond.<br />Murray did not reserve this kind of bluster for only the mighty in the world of sport. <br />&quot;Al Scates?!&quot; he once exclaimed of UCLA's volleyball coach. &quot;He is to volleyball what Napoleon was to artillery.&quot;<br />Every morning, Southern Californians woke up and were reminded of one of the very best reasons for living here. Jim Murray's column in the Los Angeles Times was that reason. Actually, Murray was syndicated, so it was not just Los Angelenos who enjoyed his work, but the fact that he belonged to us was a source of civic pride, like the Beach Boys, the film industry, or our coast line. <br />If you were a writer, you read him in awe, like an actor watching Olivier do Othelo, or a young pitcher checking out Randy Johnson. If you liked sports, or even if you did not, you just appreciated the guy.<br />When some friends of mine lived in Paris, I would send them care packages from home. Nothing was more valuable to them than Jim Murray's column.<br />When Jim passed away a few years ago, it was like seeing part of the Smithsonian lost to a fire. When the Times published a selection of his columns from 1990-98, it was like seeing the demolished portion of the great museum re-furbished. Or at least like a farewell exhibit.<br />He is gone, we will never see his likes again, but we can at least read and re-read &quot;The Last of the Best&quot;,with a forward by Tommy Lasorda and an introduction by the Times venerable sports editor, Bill Dwyre.<br />Murray towers above his profession, like Grantland Rice and Red Smith, but as New York Times columnist Dave Anderson says, he is to be compared with the likes of Twain and Hemingway. A great American. His work: Literature.<br />Murray was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1990, and his response was &quot;I never thought you could win a Pulitzer Prize just for quoting Tommy Lasorda correctly.&quot;<br />Lasorda was greatly honored that Murray thought of him during his great moment, and Tommy has it right. Like Vin Scully and very, very few others, Murray was a guy who towered above the athletes he covered. The ones with some brains and respect for history knew that. If they did not, Murray never let it bother him. Let the ignorant wallow in their stupidity!<br />Murray came to sportswriting after covering Hollywood. He once had a date with Marilyn Monroe, but she left him before the night was over for another guy.<br />Murray understood. The other guy was Joe DiMaggio.<br />Murray wrote with his heart. He had compassion. He also read like crazy. He was a man of great knowledge who never wrote down to his readers. Many chose to educate themselves on who some great violinist or ballet dancer was, simply because Murray would mention them in a column. He make erudition a very cool thing.<br />In so doing, he did for sportswriting what Clarence Darrow did for the legal profession, MacArthur for a career in the military. He made it important, something to be attained and worked for. <br />Sportswriters were like carnival barkers before Murray came along. Hacks who drank too much and wrote like high school dropouts, which most of them were.<br />Nowadays, they study guys like Murray and Jimmy Cannon at prestigious journalism schools. <br />Mostly, though, he entertained. He made you think, and he made you laugh.  Read &quot;The Last of the Best&quot;.<br />God bless Jim Murray.	2004-02-23

While many of the athletes are not pitchers, Seth has a special fondness for moundsmen.<BR>\\"But the tales that pitchers tell stand out above those told by all other players,\\" Swirsky writes. \\"A pitcher stands alone on the mound...\\" Swirsky has compiled letters by pitchers in the Hall of Fame, and by pitchers the average baseball fan never heard of.

The result was a diary of the 1969 season, in which the former star pitcher talked about drinking, drugs, sex and RACE, all subjects the liberal \\"clubhouse lawyer\\" had an axe to grind on.  \\"Ball Four\\" had more edge than a Doors concert, breaking new ground long before Watergate, the Internet and Monica Lewinsky.  The old protocols had protected J.F.K.'s sex life, but Bouton, who probably idolized Daniel Ellsberg, felt the clubhouse adage \\"What you do here, what you say here, what you see here, let it stay here,\\" did not apply.  <BR> Bouton pissed off Commissioner Bowie Kuhn with his expose of players' common habit of popping amphetamines.  He pissed off a lot of wives by revealing a peculiar member of the female species known as \\"Baseball Annies,\\" attractive young women who enjoy sleeping with ballplayers.  He pissed off his old Yankee teammates by putting the myth to Mickey Mantle's legend, paying homage to The Mick's Olympian abilities, but talking about Mantle's equally prodigious drinking habit.  <BR> Bouton describes \\"beaver hunting,\\" a popular player pastime in which they drilled holes in the dugout in order to look up the dresses of girls in the front row.  Gives a whole new meaning to the term \\"box seat,\\" doesn't it? <BR>Bouton comes from the \\"white man is to blame for all the black man's problems\\" ideology, and he put the lie to baseball's claim of being color blind,  with enlightening racial statistics that revealed that many of the game's stars were black, but few journeymen were.    <BR>Many of his conservative teammates felt he was a bit of a Communist.  It has been said that Stalin would have had a job in baseball if he brought the high heat, which Bouton could do, but the Yankees dropped him like a bad habit as soon as he hurt his arm.<BR>\\"Ball Four\\" made Bouton rich and famous, holds up well today,and is a gem of humor, irony and inside baseball.	2004-02-23

Halberstam examines the loser of the 1964 World Series, the New York Yankees, who represent the old America, and the winners, the St. Louis Cardinals, who represent the new.<BR> The Yankees were the Republican Party, conservative, white, country club elite, old money, Wall Street, the status quo, featuring Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Whitey Ford.  Their style of play was to not take chances, and they only had a couple black players.<BR> The Cardinals mirrored Berkeley rabble rousers, and they played &quot;National League baseball&quot;--aggressive, stealing bases, stretching singles into doubles.  Bob Gibson-black, college-educated, a man's man with something to prove,  was their undisputed leader.  Curt Flood was another thoughtful black athlete who harbored quiet resentment over his treatment by rednecks in Southern minor league towns.  Tim McCarver came from a well-to-do white family in Memphis that employed black servants, his only frame of reference, until Gibson asked to take a sip from his coke.  McCarver hesitatingly handed Gibby the can, Gibby took a big old honkin' Samuel L. Jackson sip, flashed the kid a giant smile, and handed the can back.  McCarver's lesson: Sharing with black's is just like sharing with whites.<BR> Halberstam details the metaphor of these two clubs, in which the Yankees would fall from their lofty perch, only to rise once they changed their ways in accordance with the world around them, mirroring the Reagan Revolution.  The Cardinals would win three pennants in the `60s, Gibson ascending to Hall of Fame status, while McCarver grew up to be the modicum of tolerance.  Flood became the symbol of the union movement with a fall-on-his-sword lawsuit challenging the reserve clause, opening the door to freedom and riches for numerous players.	2004-02-23

Certainly, the state has great tradition, going back to John Wooden and Piggy Lambert, right on up to Rick Mount, Bobby Knight and Larry Bird. Now, Purdue University history professor Randy Roberts tells a little different story about Midwestern sports. The Crispus Attacks High School basketball team from Indianapolis, a team comprised of poor, urban black kids, overcame terrific obstacles to capture for coach Ray Crowe the 1955 and 1956 state titles.<BR>Crowe's talented squad was led by Oscar Robertson, who would go on to a hall of Fame career with the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks. The &quot;Big O&quot; would also capture a Gold Medal at the Rome Olympics'. In '55, Crispus Attucks became the first all-black school to capture a state championship. In '56, they were the first to go undefeated. <BR>Crispus Attucks &quot;helped define and enshrine the Hoosiers' myth by being its negation,&quot; according to Roberts. This is an inspiring story of race, joy and achievement during a critical time in this nation's history. While Crispus Attucks was winning on the hardwood,  hard-fought civil rights were being won for black people in the Supreme Court (Brown vs. Board of Education). What is often forgotten is that many of the key battlegrounds of the civil rights era were not in the South, but in the North--that is, the Midwest.<BR>Roberts' story of social upheaval, racism and the dawn of a new era in politics centers on a school that was built for blacks. Actually, Crispus Attucks was built so white students would not have to sit next to black students in the 1920s. The school first had to petition the Indiana High School Athletic Association just to compete in the state tournament.<BR>Roberts' also tells how &quot;The Big O&quot; spurned Indiana U.because coach Branch McCracken was said to be a racist. Indiana native John Wooden tried to get him to U.C.L.A. (can you imagine that?), but Oscar envisioned a long bus ride (he was afraid of air planes) and chose Cincinnati instead.     <BR>Roberts has written a number of sports history books. In &quot;But They Can't Beat Us&quot;, he tells the story of Robertson, a shy kid who shined in athletics. He tells the story of Coach Crowe, who instilled his team with pride and discipline. Through hard work and talent, the Tigers' were able to forge one of the great stories in prep sports history. For fans of high school sports, and particularly Indiana basketball, &quot;But They Can't Beat Us&quot; is a must read.	2004-02-23

Alexander's Ty Cobb is an illuminating review of the legendary early Twentieth Century baseball superstar.  This audio book, read by Walter Zimmerman, is written more like historical biography than a baseball book<br /> Alexander dispels many long-held Cobb myths.  Cobb was mean and nasty, but not nearly the ogre of legend.  In fact, Cobb was a devout Christian (Baptist), very well spoken, a man who cared about his public image, and engaged himself in many acts of on and off-field kindness.  Caricatured as a savage racist by revisionist history, Cobb actually was kindly in his relations with the many black people he grew up with in Georgia, some of whom worked for his family.  He had no patience for blacks he considered uppity.  He was not Branch Rickey, but he was not the Grand Dragon of the K.K.K., either.  Miserly?  Sometimes, but without fanfare he took care of players who had hit the skids.  A spikes-sharpened demon?  You bet, but Ty also shook hands with his combatants after the dust settled, and performed various acts of dovish peacemaking for the benefit of hostile fans.<br /> Alexander is not a psychiatrist, but it is obvious that the fact that Cobb's mother killed his father in what may not have been an accident, during an incident that occurred because Mr. Cobb suspected Mrs. Cobb of having an affair, shaped Ty's combative nature.  What has been lost over the years is that Cobb became friendly with Babe Ruth (common legend holding that he always hated him).  Cobb was a shrewd millionaire investor who never needed to work after baseball, therefore separating himself from regular contact with people while living in huge mansions that were too big for him, after his wife left.  Most telling is the relationship Cobb had with his two male children.  He raised them strictly, and because of baseball travel left much of the child rearing to his wife.  When he retired, they were grown up and on their own, and Cobb had genuine regrets for &quot;missing&quot; their childhood's.  He wished he had been a doctor, so he could have been home for his kids, and when one of his sons went into medicine, Cobb lamented that if he, too, were a doctor they would have something in common.  With all that baggage in tow, Cobb had to endure the premature deaths of both of the boys from untimely illnesses, living the last 20-odd bitter years of his life blaming himself.<br /> Cobb may have been hard to live with, but this book empathetically explains some of the demons that drove the man into becoming a brilliant stock manipulator, a taskmaster father, an unfeeling husband, a reviled teammate, a hated opponent, and in the opinion of those who saw him, perhaps the greatest baseball player who ever lived!d on their own, and Cobb had genuine regrets for &quot;missing&quot; their childhood's.

US	50304168	R34WW32TSAJI2V	0895261391	468254470	Useful Idiots: How Liberals Got It Wrong in the Cold War and Still Blame America First	Books	5	10	16	N	N	Liberals are on the wrong side of history	The Truth, as they say, will set us free. This simple fact explains why the inexorable tide of history favors conservatism and leaves the liberals in the dust. Mona Charen's book is just straightforward facts that have been obscured by the people who had a vested interest in keeping the facts from becoming known. Winners write the history, and conservatives are the winners. The underlying question throughout Charen's book is, why do liberals harm America? It requires some psychology, applied to the issue of order and power. First, there is a strain that runs through a never-ending segment of the population that is anarchistic in nature, embodied by Russian emigre \\"Red Emma\\" Goldman. This strain believes there should be no government, just a body of \\"elites\\" who will make the right decisions that most yahoos are not smart enough to make. Combine this with their great unease with the power of America. History tells us global power is corrupting. Conservatives think God endowed America with the ability to do His good work after centuries of evil. Liberals prefer either not to believe in God, or that He places no special sanction on America. Therefore, they say America is not checked by morality, its leaders prone to the mistakes of Napoleon, the Roman Empire, the Spanish Inquisition, etc. Conservatism requires a faith in America to do the right thing, and Charen demonstrates that we have rewarded that faith from the beginning. Liberals are the ones who do not do the right thing, so they must discredit those who do in order to hide their own inadequacies.	2003-07-12

Mencken of our time. Her legal training comes in handy, because she lays out her argument in the logical, orderly manner of an attorney prosecuting a case. Ann makes use of the \\"but for\\" premise of the law, otherwise known as proximate causation. That is, she truthfully details how history plays out. Time after time, good results of history would not have occurred \\"but for\\" the bold actions of conservatives, while poor results of history would not have occurred \\"but for\\" the weak actions of liberals. She lays out straightforward facts that simply detail Truth by reading them with no need for additional commentary. There is another legal term for this: Res ipsa loquiter (\\"The things speaks for itself\\"). She does not claim that all liberals are traitors. There is a need for liberal argument in a two-party system. But she does demonstrate that when liberals have power, millions of human beings die. She chillingly describes how the 1995 Venona Project confirmed the worst suspicions of Richard Nixon and Joe McCarthy, that some 500 Communist spies worked for the State Department and the Roosevelt/Truman Administrations, at a time when the U.N. Charter was written to favor the Soviets and China was lost to Communism. Result: Mass murder above and beyond Hitler's regime. She goes on to describe weak-kneed Democrats, who allow every major war to start but never finish them, exposing Lyndon Johnson's losing strategy in Vietnam, as compared to the way Richard Nixon (who had the 1960 election stolen from him by the Kennedys) or Barry Goldwater would have brought victory to Vietnam if they had the opportunity in the beginning. She describes the disgusting manner in which the Teddy Kennedy Democrats used Watergate as pure political theatre, creating first the Church hearings that left the U.S. vulnerable, then hung the South Vietnamese out to dry. Result: North Vietnamese savagery and Pol Pot's Cambodia, where some 2 million died under Communism. Jimmy Carter's Presidency invited Communist expansion and Islamic terror, but Ronald Reagan turned it back. Ann describes Reagan winning the Cold War without firing a shot, and shows us how close we would be to losing the War on Terror if liberals were prevailing in the current climate. God bless a country - America - that produces the likes of Ann Coulter.	2003-07-12
