Mr. Scully's book is different from 99% of the other animal rights books at Amazon because he is not coming from that perspective AT ALL, and in fact spends some time discussing the problems with that kind of thinking.  What he IS saying - and it makes a lot of sense - is that it is precisely because human beings ARE superior to animals that we owe them compassion and respect - and he gives graphic examples of how we are failing in that regard (factory farms, unnecessary hunting, etc.).  If you believe that God's mercy extends even to the humblest of His creatures, this is a book you MUST read.	2003-05-19

That's right, it's not Margaret Mitchell's &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.  It's Alexandra Ripley's.  And unless you're just opposed in principle to the idea of one author writing about another author's fictional characters, you'll find Ripley's &quot;Scarlett&quot; holds up very well on its own.  She has done a fine job of finding the &quot;voices&quot; of Mitchell's characters, and as someone who has read GWTW at least 20 times, I can vouch for the fact that never, no NEVER, did I look up from the page indignantly shouting, &quot;Wait a minute - [he/she] would NEVER have said/done that!&quot;  Well done, Miss Ripley - thanks!	2003-05-14

You really have to pay attention.  This is not \\"fast food\\" - and for a previous reviewer to dismiss Monsignor Knox, and this book, as \\"antimodernist\\", perhaps says more about the reviewer than about Monsignor Knox.  I highly recommend that you print out the sample pages which Amazon.com provides, and read them, slowly, carefully, lovingly.  Knox's writing is his own best advertisement - you will see that the slower you read, the more you get out of it, and the more you WANT to read.  At which point, buy it!	2002-11-11

The author goes to great lengths to examine and sort out all the claims made about Padre Pio in a fair-minded, nonjudgmental manner.  And the most wonderful thing about Padre Pio turns out to be not just the miracles and the wonders that he performed, but his great love and devotion for Christ.

However, whether or not you believe in the miracle of Lourdes, you should know that the author either lied or made a really stupid mistake in his investigation.<br />Bernardette, the visionary, stated that the Virgin Mary told her, \\"I am the Immaculate Conception\\".  According to Nickell, Bernardette CHANGED HER MIND after the authorities told her that Mary would never say that and agreed to reword that sentence as \\"I am the product of the Immaculate Conception\\".<br />Now anyone who's familiar with the story of Our Lady of Lourdes - even if you've only seen the sentimentalized Hollywood movie starring Jennifer Jones - knows that that is simply not true!  Yes, the authorities did TRY to get Bernadette to change the wording, but she refused, insisting that's what \\"The Lady\\" said.  And that phrase, \\"I am the Immaculate Conception\\", appears on every holy card, medal, or other representation of the vision to this day.<br />The fact that Mr. Nickell didn't take the time or trouble to check this out made me doubt both his credibility and his objectivity.	2002-06-14

It would be interesting to know how (or if) their relationship was affected by this book - did they speak at all after it was published?  (By the way - my sympathies, Bill.

Anyone who prays the Rosary regularly knows that sometimes you really need some &quot;meat&quot; for your meditation.  And most of the Rosary booklets out there are just that - booklets, which are fine in their way but don't really give you much to think about.  I prefer to have LOTS of material to chew over while I'm meditating on each mystery, so much that I can't possibly finish it all in one sitting.  There is an average of 15 pages devoted to EACH mystery, which provides a very substantial meal!  I'd compare it to Kevin Orlin Johnson's &quot;Rosary : Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads&quot; - if you liked that one you'll love this one too!	2002-01-23

The author spends more time debunking orthodox Christianity than discussing agnostic belief, which is what I was looking for.  Maybe that means that agnosticism is only a reaction to orthodoxy, rather than an independent system of belief.  In which case I would have been better off spending my $20 on the latest \\"Garfield\\" collection and a cup of Starbucks coffee.  Still, if you're looking for some basic information on the flaws of Christianity in a readable format, this makes for a good reference work.	2001-10-16

I found a copy of this book, the 7th edition published in 1937, in my grandfather's bookshelf after his death and fell in love.  The best way I can think to describe this book is a &quot;film noir&quot; writer's guide, because the whole tone of the book reminds me of how a writer's guide would sound if it were written by Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe!

That's actually what this painfully well-written book is all about:  the persistent prejudice in our culture specifically aimed at fat women.  Any woman who tries to speak out against this, to say that perhaps our body weight isn't a character flaw, that perhaps we should be judged by the &quot;content of our character,&quot; is subject to ridicule and scorn.

However, she helps you put the risks in perspective by  showing, using facts, figures, common sense and humor (that doesn't insult  your intelligence), how the benefits of flying far outweigh the risks.  Not  only that but she devotes a chapter to what *you* as an individual - and a  consumer - can do to improve airline safety - something I hadn't even  considered before reading this!  If you're scared to fly but HAVE to, I  highly recommend this over any of the other &quot;fear of flying&quot;  books - if you can get it before your next flight, it'll really help you a  lot.	2000-02-02

Some rebellious soul at my extremely fundamentalist college's library managed to procure a copy of this book when it first came out (1979 or 1980, I believe), and when I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  After  I'd finished it, I began a little civil disobedience - putting up signs in  the commissary to the effect that God was a sexist, the Rapture was a myth,  etc.  When the administration got wind of it, they called me into the  Dean's office and I proudly told them I had come to realize Christianity  was a sexist myth used mainly to keep women in their place.  I (naively)  showed him the book that had brought about this realization, Mary Daly's  &quot;Beyond God the Father,&quot; and the poor guy almost had a heart  attack right there in the office.  The end result was, I was  &quot;allowed&quot; to stay (though I was forbidden to post any more  subversive signs) and the library was warned not to purchase any more books  by that author.  Fortunately, they ignored that directive, and I ignored  mine, and as a result, had a much more exciting time in college than I'd  ever dreamed.  What a great book!	2000-01-19

To the reader from Tennessee below, the reason it is important to read this book - and important to find out if Hitchens' allegations are true - is because Mother Teresa was a very powerful woman who set up a series of  medical facilities which are still in operation.  One of Hitchens' most  disturbing criticisms - which has since been confirmed by former members of  the Congregation - is that the millions of dollars' worth of donations sent  to Mother Teresa by people like you and me were NEVER used to make these  clinics more sanitary or to provide basic medical care for the indigent  people who arrived at their doorstep.  The reason, Hitchens says, that  Mother Teresa is known for her work with the dying is that so many people  died in her clinics!  Listen, folks, if even *one* person died  unnecessarily, that's one too many and more than enough justification for  Hitchens to conduct this long-overdue investigation!	2000-01-19

(And even though I know he didn't believe in God,  well, what the hell - thank God for Carl Sagan, and all the others like  him, who try so hard to help us be a little less gullible!)	2000-01-04

If you're looking for a truly funny comic strip that will make you laugh out loud without insulting your intelligence, you've gotta check out Rick Detorie's &quot;One Big Happy&quot;!  Unlike a lot of &quot;family&quot;  strips, this one actually seems to be based on real people.  The adults are  neither overly &quot;goody-goody&quot; nor bumbling idiots, and the kids  aren't saccharine-sweet or smart-mouthed brats.  Every character - Ruthie,  Joe, Frank, Ellen, and the grandparents - is just like someone you know -  or would like to know.  I love this series!	1999-12-22

You won't be sorry you got it - if you are, feel free to send it back to Amazon for a full refund, right guys?  (Or better yet, send it to me! nyuk nyuk!)  (Oh, and P.S. - this isn't anything to do with \\"Get Smart!\\" the TV series - it's \\"Dr. Science\\".)	1999-11-16

I'm a Catholic, and I  know the &quot;Maria Monk&quot; story was an anti-Catholic lie.  Well, this  sounds to me like an anti-Satanist lie.  It's fine to write about other  religions and even criticize various doctrines and ideas you disagree with  (and I DO disagree with Satanism!!).  But scare tactics like this book will  only backfire when the truth comes out.	1999-09-24

I love my Church and believe her teachings, but wish to apologize with all my heart for those like the writers of this book, and some of those who have written reviews here, who  hate you so much.  I would like to remind all Catholics that our Pope, John  Paul II, has asked us to apologizing for the sins committed by our Church  during the past millennium, and in that spirit I write this.  We don't have  to agree on religious doctrine -- in fact, we will probably NEVER agree on  many important issues -- but may the evils committed as a result of this  book NEVER happen again.	1999-09-24

While scrolling through the list of Peanuts books available through Amazon.com, I couldn't help but notice that NONE of these wonderful books has yet received any customer reviews.  So let me be the first -- you will  NOT regret buying a Peanuts book by Charles M. Schulz!  In fact, my  personal observation about Mr. Schulz is that his newer strips are even  better than the older &quot;classics&quot;!  This is a genuinely gifted  person.  Show your love and respect for &quot;good ol' Charlie Brown&quot;  -- buy as many Peanuts books from Amazon.com as you can possibly afford!  Your descendants will be profoundly grateful -- and you'll have lots of fun  (re)reading them yourself!	1999-02-18
