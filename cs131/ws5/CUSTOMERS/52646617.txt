I found that both the very bullish and the very bearish reviews have significant merit.  On the plus side Taleb aggressively addresses a topic that many readers will be interested in - randomness in our daily lives.  He discusses many important concepts that are not known or at least not very well understood by the general public and experts alike.  These include: 1) that uncertainty and luck play a large role in the outcomes of human activities (much more than most people think); 2) that a correlation between two types of events does not necessarily mean that one causes the other; 3) that statistics and the rare random event are poorly understood by almost everyone; 4) that small differences in performance and ability can cause very large differences in the rewards or difficulties that people obtain in life; and 5) that humans are very irrational beings and are not very good at thinking probabilistically and understanding the probabilities of even everyday events rationally.  All of these are important points that I commend Taleb for bringing to our attention. <br /> <br />However, there are significant drawbacks to this book, which to some readers will make the book significantly unenjoyable or even impossible to read.  While it did not significantly bother me, Taleb does have an attitude or style which at times tends to the snobbish.  The author repeatedly reminds readers that he is well traveled, is a \\"voracious\\" reader, pursues his exercise routines \\"assiduously\\", and is from upper class Mediterranean roots.  Further, at some points in the book, he writes from a bitterness and contempt (which he admits) for journalists, economics, others in his profession, and generally those who are not \\"literate persons\\".  In general, I would have preferred that Talebleft most of these personal issues out of the book and that he have written it with a little more rigor.  But in fairness Taleb clearly warns the reader that his book is a personal memoir and not a treatise.  Unfortunately, I believe this is mostly a cop-out to avoid addressing his critics on the merits.  The book has the look and feel of a treatise, and I was hoping for a treatise, but it doesn't deliver.   <br /> <br />STRENGTHS: Addresses an important topic not well understood and not written about enough; most people will benefit from a better understanding of the major concepts brought out in this book; the author is well read and not afraid to offend and pursue the material aggressively <br /> <br />WEAKNESSES: I hate to say it because I find the author likeable in many ways, but too much of the author's personality comes through and what it suggests to me is that he may have significant insecurities and passive aggressive issues that may even be pathological; many readers will have a hard time getting past the author's aggressive style or perceived \\"bad attitude\\", some readers may even see the book as political; the book is \\"a personal memoir and not a treatise\\" and thus lacks the rigor that many would expect; the author takes great pains to try to avoid addressing any substantial criticism (this is the first book I've read where the author feels the need to attack the credibility of Amazon reviewers calling them \\"unqualified\\" to comment on his book) <br />	2005-09-13

About Great Managing, Great Leading, and Sustained Individual Success	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An Excellent Book Despite the Questionable Title	REVIEW:   The title of this book was an immediate turn-off for me because of the hyped-up nature of the phrase, \\"The One Thing\\".  I'm always on the look out for charlatans who tend to make use of such exaggerated claims more often than the average author.  However, I decided to read this book anyway since I read the two books that Marcus Buckingham is coauthor of, First Break All the Rules and Now, Discover Your Strengths, and those two books are two of my favorites.  I'm glad I read this book and I now have a third favorite book having Marcus Bucking ham as an author. <br /> <br />In short, the knowledge I gained from this book will help make me a more successful manager.  The author has a clear and concise theory and uses the right amount of practical advice on managing and leading people and organizations.  Perhaps the most important thing I learned from The One Thing is the difference between managing and leading.  These terms are thrown around all the time in mass market business books, but this is the first one that I have read which very clearly defines the distinction between the two and concisely and practically explains how the roles differ in an organization.  The book is well worth the read for this insight alone.  Also, the book is fairly well organized and is written in an easy to read style typical of similar business books.   <br /> <br />STRENGTHS: Easy to read; fairly well organized; contains the right mix (for me) of theory and practical advice (which is very good).  Knowledge gained will help make you a better leader and/or manager of people.  <br /> <br />WEAKNESSES: I thought a couple of the chapters were too long and I was disappointed that the book does not have an index.  Also, Buckingham cites numerous studies in the book, but does not give enough information for the reader to find and review those sources for herself.  However, none of these weaknesses should deter you from reading this book. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: Anyonewho liked Buckingham's previous coauthored books.  Anyone who likes books written by authors such as Jim Collins and Peter Drucker.  Anyone who considers themselves a manager of people or a leader in an organization needs to read this book.  It may be somewhat more useful to more experienced managers.  <br />	2005-09-03

Here &quot;innovation&quot; is used in its broader context and not just technical innovation.<br />The title and subtitle suggested to me that the book was about overall business strategy and business model innovation at the big picture level, however, I found the opposite.  To me this book is actually about continuous business improvement at the operating level and it does an excellent job at that.  I haven't read another book that so thoroughly and numerously discusses tactical and operational ideas related to good business practices.  The core business concepts of others that I recognized were Peter Drucker's marketing concept, his idea that profit centers cannot exist inside an organization, and Michael Porter's Value Chain concept.  The extent that the book is strategic, it should be thought of as a bottom-up evolution of a new business model though continuous improvement rather than a top-down approach.  The authors take the right tone and show you how to get to a better business model without claiming to know the &quot;best&quot; model.  The book has many examples that should stimulate your own ideas for business operating improvement.  The authors clearly know the right questions to ask.<br />The biggest drawback of the book that I found is the authors' tendency to go to excess.  While the excess of ideas for business improvement is probably a good thing, the other excesses were a little annoying.  For example, the book starts off with 30 quotes from readers recommending the book - I think a handful would have been adequate.  Another example, the book has two Forwards, a Preface, an Introduction, a Prologue, and an Introduction to Part One - Chapter One starts on page 61.  The content is generally good, so this is little more than annoyance.  However, I personally prefer reading more concisely written books.<br />STRENGTHS:  Book is written with a focused purpose and author clearly tries to make the book effective for the reader.  Chapters end with Key Questions which do a good job of summarizing core concepts.  Lots of ideas for stimulating improvements in business practices, processes, and pricing.  I found the last two chapter especially useful for those interesting in marketing.  I generally liked and agreed with nearly all of the content.  I think the authors would make excellent consultants.<br />WEAKNESSES:  The &quot;excesses&quot; noted above.  Some side bars I think are too long and interrupt the flow of the book.	2003-09-08

However, there are significant differences between the two and the main differences are reflected in the titles. As the titles suggest, &quot;Jack&quot; is more of an autobiography told in a very opinionated manner whereas Gerstner's book is more about the company during Gerstner's years and how (in broad terms) the company transitioned to a more flexible, entrepreneurial organization.<br />The book is organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations. The first four parts are mostly about IBM and the transformation whereas the last section is mostly about Gerstner's views on industry, society, journalists, etc. I highly enjoyed sections 1-4 but felt section 5 didn't really fit the book purpose and it seemed almost as though the editor/publisher convinced him to add the section in order to make the book the standard size. The problem with section 5 is that Gerstner's states clearly that he believes the book should be about IBM and the turnaround, but section 5 is a half hearted attempt to give some personal musings about miscellanious things that at best seem like good political opinions and at worst sound like whinings.<br />However, excepting section 5, I got more out of this book more than Welch's. Gerstner clearly tries to lead the reader to greater understanding of the IBM situation, the thinking behind the decisions that were made, and the resulting turnaround. He does this in a style that doesn't suggest his answers are universal ones. He recognizes that imparting better understanding rather than the right answers is the appropriate goal for helping others to achieve better results in complex environments. This book probably doesn't deserve a permanant place on your bookshelf (i.e. it is unlikely to be a classic), but if your looking for better understanding of the IBM turnaround or of large business in general, this is a good book to read. If your looking for a better understanding of an individual CEO read Welch's book.<br />STRENGTHS: Written in the standard style of popular business books so it has fairly short chapters and is easy to read. Doesn't try to espouse too much theory or universal answers. Does a good job at explaining why certain decisions were made and certain strategies selected. Doesn't get bogged down in stock prices and financial data.<br />WEAKNESSES: Section 5, Gerstner's observations I thought was off target and weaker than the remainder of the book. Little insight into Gerstner himself (but that wasn't the book's intention). Some sections were a bit too brief and could've used additional detail.	2003-05-06

I decided to read it anyway since I am a &quot;thinking&quot; personality type and the book looked easy to read.  I was expecting the book to read like a hyped-up mass market self help book.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I found the book very practical, easy to read, and genuine.  I picked up a good deal of useful information and helpful methods.  These include understanding (within the brain) what makes things seem funny to step-by-step thinking procedures.<br />De bono writes very simply and even when he explains theoretical concepts the explanations are not technical.  There is some tendency by the author to regularly cite his many other books and to use his own made up words and acronyms.  I found the citations to the other works authentic and not overt plugs.  Similarly the use of coined terms and acronyms seemed very practical and not driven by ego as I've noticed with many authors.<br />STRENGTHS:  Very practical methods and ideas to improve thinking, easy to read, short chapters.  Optional practice activities and not too technical or academic.<br />WEAKNESSES:  Some might not like the regular use of coined terms and acronyms.  Only cites his own books.  Some things explained too briefly.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Anyone interested in improving their thinking.	2003-05-06
US	52646617	R1LEU3S0LY0NMW	0415249929	137017267	All Life is Problem Solving	Books	4	40	41	N	N	A Taste of Popper	This book is a collection of 15 lectures/speeches/interviews that Popper gave at various points throughout his career (earliest 1958, latest 1994).  They are organized into two sections (1) those related to natural science and (2) those related to history and politics.  The first section relates to theory of science and knowledge in an evolutionary context with the process of problem solving at the core.  In the second section Popper addresses problem solving more generally (\\"all life is problem solving\\") and shares his thoughts on subjects such as war, peace, communism, and interpretation of history.<br />This book has the weaknesses and strengths that you would expect from a work not originally intended to be published in written form.  The benefits are that the chapters are fairly brief and easy to read. Also, Popper's style is nearly anti-academic as he tries almost too hard to simplify the material in order to make it understandable to all.  The primary drawbacks are that the book can't be well organized and there are significant repetition and overlap in ideas.  Additionally, the book doesn't provide the level of detail that one normally expects in a book by a major thinker.<BR>  <BR>This is the first book of Popper's that I've read.  I became interested in his work by being briefly introduced to some of his thinking from other authors.  This book did not provide enough detail to satisfy my interest in Popper, but it served to confirm to me that he is a first rate thinker and that his other works should be near the top of my reading list.  I especially enjoyed the surprise of reading Popper's thoughts on Saddam Hussein and the threat of nuclear weapons - highly relevant to our situation today (early 2003).  There is no doubt where Popper would stand on the current debate about Iraq.<br />So this is a good book to get a taste of Popper or maybe for a quick review of some of his thinking if you are already familiar with him.  However, this isn't the best book for studying Popper's ideas in detail.	2003-02-18

It is targeted to a general audience and as it is fairly short its purpose is merely to introduce the individuals and their main influential ideas.<br />The book focuses mainly on Western civilization and then primarily on scientific and technical achievements.  All the familiar names are here: Plato, Einstein, Newton, Darwin, Marx and many others not so famous.  The author can easily be criticized for leaving out many important ideas, especially social or non-technical innovations, but this could probably be said about anyone's top 75 list of great ideas.  If you are looking for a relatively easy to read book that introduces some of the most important thinkers of the past 4000 years, this book will do.  Just don't expect a comprehensive book or a thorough explanation of the ideas.  It may also make a good, light reference book for your bookshelf.<br />STRENGTHS:  I especially liked the inclusion of a picture of each individual and some discussion of the person and not just their ideas.  The book is easy to read and not too technical.<br />WEAKNESSES:  As one would expect of a book of such breadth, there is not much depth to each discussion.  Additionally, while not really affecting content, I think the book could have been a little more &quot;professionally done&quot;.  I found too many errors missed by editing and I thought the title and book cover very misleading (only a small portion of the book relates to Einstein).  I also noticed some style changes that may indicate different authorship for certain sections.	2003-02-03

This book clearly bridges that gap and explains lucidly what makes for achieving non-profit leaders and effective non-profit institutions.  The book is not a theoretical work or an academic one.  It is rather an extremely practical show-and-tell about being a great manager in a non-profit organization.  It is almost a &quot;how-to&quot; but doesn't stoop to the level of the ubiquitus but never effective &quot;10 step program&quot;.  You will be more effective by absorbing this material.<br />Drucker has done an excellent job at extracting material from three of his management books: The Effective Executive, Managing for Results, and a little bit of Innovation and Entrepreneurship [Note, these three are available as a collection called The Executive in Action].  The material is presented simply, concisely and is completely targetted to the non-profit sector with many examples including interviews with about 6-7 non-profit leaders.  Highly recommended.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book is fairly short, consise, easy to read yet full of great content.  Each section includes a brief summary at the end and has at least one interview with a non-profit manager that makes the ideas even more practical. <br />WEAKNESSES: The book could use some select references to his other works and some graphics.  But this is not Drucker's style.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Managers/leaders in the non-profit sector should consider this a must read.  Other fans of Drucker that would like a refresher on some of his concepts.	2003-01-25

The book is not a destination in that its purpose is not to espouse a particular philosophy or theory, although he does make his own opinions quite clear (e.g. about what is good philosophy and what is not).  Even though the book has a few weaknesses, it is highly interesting and easy to read.  Especially useful to those who are beginning their own &quot;journey&quot; into philosophy.<br />This book is also typical of a number of others that I like in that it is hard to categorize.  It is not quite: an autobiography, or a book on philosophy, or a biography of other philosophers.  It is in some ways all of these and even includes a chapter that is almost a &quot;how-to&quot; on writing a novel.  The advanced philosophy reader may not gain much from Magee's book, but an amateur or beginning reader like myself should find it very worthwhile.  It helped me understand some of the major schools or trends in philosophy and helped me create a reading program for further study (e.g. which authors to start with and which to avoid for a while).  I also found it to be a good book to read after Magee's other book &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; which started my interest in the subject.  I also highly recommend that as an introduction.<br />STRENGTHS:  For the most part, just the right breadth and depth for the non-advanced philosophy reader.  The personal accounts of Magee's interactions with philosophers such as Popper and Russell are very interesting and hard to find anywhere else.  The author has done a very good job at making his personal journey broadly interesting to the reader.<br />WEAKNESSES:  For my interests, Magee spends too much time rejecting certain types of philosophy (e.g. linguistic).  His arguments are convincing, but the total amount of ink spent on it is too much and he sounds almost defensive at times (perhaps at not rejecting it sooner?). <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Probably most useful to the non-advanced philosophy reader who is beginning his/her own &quot;journey&quot;.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot; also by Magee	2003-01-22

TITLE:  Forest or The Trees?<br />REVIEW:  I agreed with a lot of what Goleman has to say in Primal Leadership and I'm fairly sympathetic to his general theme that much existing management theory and teachings lie too much on the analytical/reasoning side and do not put enough emphasis on the \\"softer\\"/psychological issues.  However, while many of Goleman's statements and cited research make sense (the \\"trees\\") they often don't seem to fit well within his model/theory (the \\"forest\\"), which is overly one-dimensional in stating basically that \\"emotional intelligence\\" (EI) competencies are the be all and end all of leadership.<br />Goleman's theory, which seems to be based on his statement that \\"the emotional task is the original and most important\\", swings the pendulum too far in the anti-analytical direction.  He makes the same mistake as many of his analytical colleagues do/did in assuming that there is one ideal leadership mold to which everyone should be shaped into.  The purpose of the book is to get the reader to understand Goleman's emotional intelligence (EI) mold for the ideal leader and how to fit this mold.  <br />Goleman lists 19 EI competencies that the ideal leader should have.  First, note that many of the competencies are not simply emotional, but require reasoning skills/abilities.  Second, while it is true that these competencies are good to have, it is folly to expect one individual to try to obtain all of these.  This is a throwback to the myth of the well-rounded organizational man of the 1950s IBM which has been discredited.  One should focus on their strengths and manage their weaknesses, not become a well rounded person in all these competencies. <br />The other major disappointment I have with Primal Leadership is the same that I have with most books on \\"leadership\\".  As Peter Drucker has taught, the only definition of a leader is someone who has followers.  This definition includes Hitler, Jim Jones, David Koresh and all con artists who all knew/know how to appeal to human emotions to get people to do what they want.  Books on \\"leadership\\" assume that leadership equates to management.  While this difference may seem trivial and harmless it isn't upon deeper reflection.  The primary goal of managers isn't simply to be a leader, that is to have followers, but rather to do the right things, make the organization effective/produce results, and assist employees in being productive.  Goleman does succeed to some extent in identifying what is helpful in creating followers, but it's the wrong focus.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book is fairly well written, well organized, and easy to read as one would expect of a mass market Harvard Business School Press book.  Also, I especially enjoyed the discussion of the importance of organizational vision and the importance of the culture of groups.<br />WEAKNESSES:  One-sided focus on emotional tasks.  Tries to teach the reader how to be the ideal leader (i.e. the Tiger Woods of Leadership) instead of giving the tools and information needed to help average people (which most of us are) become more effective.  Most example come from dysfunctional, rather than typical, situations.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Peter Drucker for effective management teachings.  Marcus Buckingham for the opposite of the \\"one-size-fits-all\\" management theory.	2002-12-03

The reader does indeed come away with a better appreciation for Adams as perhaps the most under-rated member of the founding fathers.<br />The strengths are in the material itself, especially the skillful use of excerpts from many letters of Adams, his wife, Jefferson and others.  Also, the narrator, Edward Herrmann has a special gift for reading audiobooks that adds to the quality of the material.<br />There were a few weaknesses, though they didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the audiobook.  First, I didn't like the way that the abridgement was done.  It wasn't smooth and seemed almost amateurish.  In hindsight, I would have listened to the unabridged version.  Second, McCullough seems to see Adams through rose colored glasses.  Other authors (see for example Paul Johnson's History of the American People) portray Adams' personality much more negatively using terms such as &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;disloyal&quot;, &quot;cantankerous&quot;, etc.  McCullough's more likely to call this part of Adams as simply &quot;outspoken&quot; for example. <br />In any event, highly recommended listening even if tilted a little towards the good side of Adams.	2002-12-03

One type is the more practical/&quot;how-to&quot; type of book where he aims directly at improving the effectiveness of managers of all types through their actions.  Such books as &quot;Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices&quot; (1974), &quot;Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship&quot; (1985), &quot;Managing for Results&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Effective Executive&quot; (1967) fall into this category (all of which are still highly relevant).  The second type, while still practical, primarily aims at imparting a broader level of understanding of politics, economy, and society (and their trends) to help executives make effective longer-term decisions and shape the future of their organizations.  His typical approach in these books is to bring an historical perspective (over decades or even centuries) into understanding the current trends of human activity that are shaping the future.  Drucker's &quot;The Age of Discontinuity&quot; (1969), &quot;Managing in a Time of Great Change&quot; (1995), and &quot;Management Challenges for the 21st Century&quot; (1999) are examples of this type.  &quot;Managing in the Next Society&quot; (2002) falls into the second category.<br />The book is actually a collection of articles that Drucker has published from 1996-2001.  The basic theme is that it is not the &quot;New Economy&quot; that executives (and all leaders) should be trying to understand it's the &quot;Next Society&quot;.  The chapters generally touch upon the three major trends that he's identified as shaping the Next Society: the decline of the young population, the decline of manufacturing, and the emergence of the information revolution.  <br />As he did with his very first book &quot;End of Economic Man&quot; in relation to WWII, Drucker is again reminding us that we must first look to understanding society if we wish to understand major historical events/transitions.  This thought is summed up best by the title of a chapter about understanding Japan - &quot;It's the Society, Stupid&quot;.  While that chapter is limited to Japan, I interpreted the book as telling us that we need to understand society in order to understand all major world events and trends.  This is especially important after 9/11 when there's a temptation to look at issues through only political, militaristic, or economic lenses.<br />STRENGTHS:  Since the book consists of articles previously published in magazines from 1996-2001, the text is generally concise, interesting, and easy to read.  I also loved the way Drucker brings history into some of the chapters (e.g. he covers Luther, Machiavelli, Hamilton, the industrial revolution, slaves, knights, and inventions such as the book, the stirrup, and the longbow).<br />WEAKNESSES:  The downside of a book of articles is that there is a lot of repetition of concepts and phrases and the book is less cohesive and focussed than it could be.  However, I didn't find this too serious of a problem.  Also, there are no graphics or charts (it's not Drucker's style).<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Those executives and leaders (whether in business, politics, or non profits) who are responsible for shaping the future of their organizations.	2002-09-24

While this may sound a little negative, the book is quite useful, easy to read, and practical.  In a way, the book is a bridge from existing management theory to practice.  I don't think Hammer breaks much new ground as far as new theory is concerned, but that's okay.  He does an excellent job at explaining how some recent theory is beginning to change actual business practice.  He takes his observations about good practices at select companies and wraps them in an &quot;Agenda&quot; to give them more appeal to the management masses.<br />Those familar with Peter Drucker's marketing concept and Michael Porter's value chain model should recognize a lot in Hammer's book.  While Hammer goes beyond mere rehashing of these concepts, they clearly have their roots in these.  While the book tends to sound a little grandiose at times (for example the subtitle, &quot;What Every Business Must Do to Dominate the Decade&quot;) the book contains many agreeable insights and concepts.  Worthwhile reading for those interested in, or responsible for, management of organizational improvement/change<br />STRENGTHS: Organized well and easy to read.  Practical and not abstract theory.  Chapters nicely summarized in bullets.  Many examples of the concepts in use at companies.  Also, the last two chapters offer some very practical advice on how to actually implement the concepts.  Too many business and management books fail to include this.<br />WEAKNESSES: If you're more interested in cutting edge theory, this probably isn't the book.  Sometimes there almost seems like too many examples which can seem like filler.  Most of the examples in the book are focused on traditional industries (e.g. manufacturing, banks, etc.).  Those that could (perhaps) benefit most from Hammer's teaching may be in newer service and non-profit organizations (e.g. education, government, healthcare).  These areas are hardly addressed by the book.  Lastly, Hammer includes almost no reference to other work or graphics.<br />WHO SHOULD READ: The book is probably most useful for mid to upper level managers/executives in medium to large organizations; especially those interested in, or responsible for, management of organizational improvement/change.  The book is less useful for those interested in new theory and those that feel they have an excellent understanding of the Drucker and Porter concepts mentioned above.<br />ALSO CONSIDER: Major works by Peter Drucker on management practice; Michael Porter &quot;On Competition&quot; (more academic tone); Clayton Christensen &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot; (for a different take on/perils of customer focus).<br />[feedback welcome]	2002-06-13

The New New Thing tells the story of Jim Clark (a founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon, and myCFO.com) &quot;groping&quot; for the next new thing.  It is a sort of biography of Jim focused in the 1990s.  Readers will gain a sense of the man and the environment of Silicon Valley in the 90s.  Michael Lewis appears to have spent a lot of time with Jim Clark in preparing this work so many of the stories are first hand and very observant.  A main theme that runs throughout the book is a contrasting of the new with the old: American facination with newness vs European comfort with the old; new computer professions vs traditional boat building; and new stock valuation technique vs old valuation methodology.  The only improvements I would have liked would be an index and photos (I read the paperback version).  I highly recommend it for those interested in Jim Clark, entrepreneur tales, Silicon Valley, Michael Lewis' other works or non-fiction story telling in general.	2002-05-20

However, for me as a new comer to the study of religions/theology, the book just offered too much material.  I was looking for more of an introduction to the major religions, including their major beliefs, rituals, differences, etc.  This book is just too detailed for me to have gotten that information efficiently.  There must have been a thousand different people brought up by Ms. Armstrong; I can remember probably less than 5.  I would have preferred something more like Brian Magee's &quot;Story of Philosophy&quot; which is an excellent non-academic introduction to philosophy.  Armstrong's book is long, thorough, and may be appropriate for the serious student of religion that has already had an introduction, but I don't recommend it as a  first read on the topic. <br />STRENGTHS:  The author's obvious breadth of readings and knowledge of the topic.  The detailed endnotes and index are a plus.<br />WEAKNESSES:  For me, the chapters were just too long and monotone.  The book could use more organization (e.g. subchapters); graphics, lists, and/or sidebars to make it more interesting and easier to read.  Also, I hated the italic font.  I couldn't tell the difference between the &quot;h&quot; and the &quot;b&quot;.  This is normally not a problem, but for someone not used to reading arabic names it's a big issue.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Serious students of religion that already have an introduction to the major religions and who don't mind reading longer books that may not be easy to read.<br />[feedback welcome]	2002-05-20

I wish more books that tackle serious subjects were written in this style.  It opens up learning of the subject to a broader audience.  Magee's book seems almost perfect as an introduction, overview, and rough history of philosophy.  It should make an excellent introduction and light reference book to the non-expert reader.  <br />I have often read books (e.g. books by Peter Drucker) that refer to various philosophers and their writings and I typically felt I had an inadequate understanding since I had very little knowledge of philosophy.  So I borrowed this book from a library and enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase it.  I especially like the way the book is organized into small, easy to read chapters with many graphics, and short sidebars.  Magee also does an excellent job of tying the philosophers into the context of the art, religion, and history of each period (in a basic, not too detailed way).<br />STRENGTHS:  Easy to read; very well organized; lots of supporting graphics (e.g. photos of period art) and sidebars; excellent index and list of suggested further readings for each philosopher; just the right level of detail for an introduction.<br />WEAKNESSES:  Academics or those more knowledgable of philosophy may find the book too simple, or even childish (easy to read and lots of pictures).<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Those who do not have an existing knowledge base of philosophy and who are looking for an easy to read general introduction, overview, or history of philosophy.<br />[feedback welcome]	2002-05-20

Although it is over a hundred pages long, it is printed in large type and the 8 chapters seem to average about 12 short paragraphs each.  <br />It is important to make sure you fit the target audience for this booklet or you will be very disappointed.  I wish the author had been more explicit (e.g. in the subtitle) about his target audience as the grand title is misleading.  The booklet is way too simplistic for those with significant management experience, those who have a management degree, and those who regularly read management books.  Those who may find the booklet most useful are young readers just starting in a management or supervisory role, especially those that supervise young (e.g. high school age) employees.  Also, it may be good for a small business owner to give to its young management trainees as a starting point for discussions on the management role.  However, those serious about management effectiveness as a career should look elsewhere (e.g. Peter Drucker).<br />The advice given is overly simplistic, but generally good.  How can you argue with chapter topics like \\"hire talented employees\\", \\"don't micromanage\\", \\"give praise instead of criticism\\", and \\"listen to employees\\".  However, some of the advice is definitely not appropriate for managers of college educated or \\"knowledge\\" workers.  As an example, the author's statement that \\"Money is the primary motivation for working\\" may be true for high school students at McDonalds, but it is definitely NOT true for knowledge workers in general.  I was disappointed the author never makes this distinction.<br />The following sample statements will give you taste of the author's style and tone: \\"you should always treat employees with respect saying \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\";  \\"Most employees will straighten out once you get a little tough with them.\\"; and \\"Managers should also listen to employees in order to get ideas about how to improve the business.\\" <br />Finally, the \\"Bonus Chapter for High Level Managers\\" which discusses the benefits of profit sharing plans just doesn't seem to fit.  Such \\"High Level Managers\\" (a term which implies an organization large enough to have a management hierarchy) should be reading management books with ideas way beyond the simplistic ones in this booklet.  If you're a manager with authority to institute a profit sharing plan and you find this booklet useful, something is amiss.  For such high level managers, the book rates way below 3 stars.<br />[feedback welcome]	2002-05-16

However, it is not a book for those new to Drucker and it is not aimed at mass market appeal.  The author is obviously very knowledgeable about Drucker's work and often adds new insight, but the book has an academic aire and is just plain sterile.  The style/tone choosen by the author is an academic one which is totally devoid of the author's personality and opinion.  Flaherty wouldn't dare state something that isn't a provable fact.  Thus, too many sentences begin with &quot;According to Drucker . . .&quot;, or &quot;Drucker maintained . . .&quot;, or &quot;Drucker argued . . .&quot; which gets boring quickly and makes for less enjoyable reading.  <br />The book is at its best when it goes beyond organizing the content of Drucker's writings and gives the reader context and additional information.  I found this mostly occured in the beginning third of the book when the author injected more of Drucker's personal history and his relationship with others (e.g. Drucker and Sloan).  There was just too few of these moments in the book.  Despite these limitations, I did find new insights into Drucker.  Overall, I'd consider the book an essential for the serious Drucker student only.  Others have plenty of other Drucker material to choose from first.<br />STRENGTHS:  A very thorough, analytical look at Drucker's work.  I liked the summary list of key concepts ending each chapter.  Exhaustively footnoted and indexed.  I repeatedly refer to the thorough list of &quot;Published Works of Peter Drucker&quot; at the end of the book.<br />WEAKNESSES:  The book is too academic for my taste.  It is totally devoid of the author's opinions and personality.  The author has a tendency to use &quot;big&quot; words e.g. &quot;chimerical&quot;, &quot;propinquity&quot;, &quot;insouciance&quot;, &quot;shibboleth&quot;, &quot;obsequious&quot;) notused by the average person.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Serious students of Drucker who've already read a number of his works.  The casual Drucker reader or reader of mass market management/business books should look elsewhere.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  &quot;Adventures of a Bystander&quot;  by P. Drucker (for an autobiographical-like look at Drucker); &quot;The World According to Peter Drucker&quot; by J Beatty (for a biographical look and an overview of Drucker's thoughts); and &quot;The Essential Drucker&quot; by P.

As the first book to take an analytical study of a business corporation (GM) from the inside, many consider it to be the catalyst of the management boom that followed.  It is certainly the first book to examine the business corporation as a social structure that brings together human beings for economic and social needs. The book is also a sort of bridge from Drucker's more political and social writings in \\"The End of Economic Man\\" and \\"The Future of Industrial Man\\" to his later more managerial writings.  It is credited with having established management of organizations as a discipline and a distinct field of study.  However, as a book originally published in 1946, is it still relevent and worth reading today?  Yes, but not for everyone.  <br />Drucker raised many new issues and concepts basic to organizations.  For example, he touched upon: dignity and status of the worker, corporate purpose, corporate contribution to and harmonization with community, management compensation and succession, worker training and development, workers as resources not costs, etc.  Since new ideas will tend to seep into the popular consciousness over time, many of the ideas he introduced have long since become popularized and accepted (e.g. the benefits of decentralization, suggestion plans, and reengineering).  However, there are also a number the concepts which are not fully appreciated today or which we tend to just give lip service.  For example, the basic concept of corporations as both economic and social institutions is still not fully appreciated or understood (neither by those on the \\"right\\" or the \\"left\\").  For me, the book was worth the read for these insights alone.  In summary, I very much recommend this book if you've read some of Drucker's other writings and are interested in reading Drucker's founding writings on the corporation as both an economic and social organization.  One option you may want to consider is to skip Part II which mostly discusses GM decentralization as a model.<br />STRENGTHS:  Great thinking and understanding from Drucker on corporations as social structures.  First thorough analytical look at a business corporation from the inside.  Important economic concepts explained too (e.g. monopoly, profit motive).<br />WEAKNESSES:  Some parts are rambling and others more concise.  Part II of the book (more specific to 1940s GM and decentralization) is more outdated.  Never a graph or equation to help understanding.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Those interested in understanding corporations as both economic and social organizations.<br />FOR SIMILAR/RELATED TOPICS, CONSIDER:  Any of Peter Drucker's other books still in print.  \\"My Years with General Motors\\" by Alfred Sloan. \\"Maslow on Management\\" by Abraham Maslow.  \\"First Break All the Rules\\" by M.

The book explores the reasons why this has ocurred despite the established firms having good management and following good management practices.  For those who are Peter Drucker fans, I believe Christensen has independently found and expanded upon two Drucker concepts in a fresh and original way.  The Drucker concepts embedded here include: (1) key changes always start with a company's non-customers and (2) the &quot;new&quot; (e.g. a company's new products) should be developed separately from the old, should be sheltered, and should not bear the same burdens as the company's established products.    The book is based on solid research and is well written.  Highly recommended for those interested in high-tech manufacturing business strategy.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book is organized very well giving the reader the option of a quick read or a detailed read.  For example, there is an excellent introduction that summarizes the main points of the book.  Also, each chapter has detailed footnotes allowing the reader to go deeper into the material if desired.  The book has plenty of case studies and graphics to illustrate key concepts.<br />WEAKNESSES:  The book has a bit of an academic feel and is not written in a casual way as found in many popular business books.

Well, you study what the great do and emulate them.  That's the point of \\"Good to Great\\".  This book answers the question, \\"How does a good company become a great company?\\"  The research team found 11 companies that met their stringent stock performance criteria exemplifying \\"good to great\\".  Then they collected, filtered and studied tons of data on these companies and determined the patterns that explain how they became great companies.  They distilled their findings in a fairly simple, easy to understand model having six components.  I'm very often disappointed with models used is business books (note: this is not just a business book) but the models used here seemed natural and didn't come off as forced or too clever.  While the book is based on very in-depth research, it does not read like a research report.  The author has done an excellent job at bridging the gap between first rate research and a mass market audience.  Many best sellers are \\"fad\\" books - this one is not.  Highly recommended for those interested in organizational excellence.<br />STRENGTHS:  Collin's writing is very interesting and easy to read with lots of real world examples and anecdotes.  The book is a quick read and many readers will finish it within a weekend.  While based on lots of research, the book does not read like a boring textbook.  The authors conclusions are delivered simply and concisely and chapters are summed up in key points.<br />WEAKNESSES:  Minor but: Too much focus on stock price as a measure of greatness (but what alternative was there?).  Charts are misleading because they are not logarithmic (distorts true performance).  Found the repeated phrase \\"If you would have put $1 into ___ in 19xx you would have $__ annoying.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  All managers, executives, and leaders of any type of organization as well as those others interested in organizational excellence.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Of course, Built to Last by J Collins & J Porras.

For me, that was this book.  The basic theme of the book is fairly simple, but like many simple things it is easy to understand, but difficult to master.   The main concept is that ideas, products, and messages (i.e. shared human information) spread just like viruses do and the point at which the virus gains critical momentum to become an epidemic is called the Tipping Point.  The book helps us understand how viruses and epidemics work (non-scientifically) - leading to analogies in how human information spreads and eventually &quot;tips&quot;.  This understanding we can use to make our own human information spreading efforts (e.g. public service messages, marketing messages) more effective.  Why do some ideas start epidemics and others do not?  What can we do to deliberately start and control positive epidemics of our own?  Tipping Point helps answer these questions.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving this book 5 stars was that the author sometimes tried to teach too much and lost focus.  He left the main theme and went too deep into subjects that need (and do) have many books written about them.  One example is the topic of the importance of environment on children.  His discussion was too deep for the purpose of this book yet not deep enough for what the subject deserves.  While there are some deficiencies, Tipping Point may become a classic and has already brought new lexicon into our language (e.g. tipping and stickiness in relation to ideas in messages).  I recommend it if the topic is important to you.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book is very simple (in a good way), entertaining, and easy to read.  I also enjoyed the smaller size (~6x8in) of the hardback version - made it easy to carry to the park at lunchtime.  Lots of interesting real world examples to the key points raised.  The book also has a very detailed index.  The writing is targeted to a broad audience and the content is not too niche.<br />WEAKNESSES:  I sometimes got the impression that the author was struggling to come up with enough material as some of the examples seem overly detailed and long.  There was also a tendency, especially toward the end of the book, for the author to veer from the main purpose of the book and try to teach us some social lessons.  Thus the book could have been more focused.  Academics my dismiss the work as being unscientific.  True, but the book is still practical.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Every knowledge worker that wants to understand the way the world works a little better.  Especially for those responsible for spreading messages or for trying to influence others' decisions (e.g. marketers).<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Robert Cialdini - Influence: The Science of Persuasion (a classic); Seth Godin - The Idea Virus (enjoyed this one too); Elaine Hatfield - Emotional Contagion; Richard Koch - The 80/20 Principle; ; Don Peppers - One to One ______.

It goes into detail on the 34 different types of talents/strengths that the authors found in their research.  \\"Now\\" is based on two simple themes: (1) each person's talents are enduring and unique, and (2) each person's greatest room for growth lies in their greatest strengths (not in improving their weaknesses as so much of our society is focused on). \\"Now\\" will help you recognize strengths (yours and other) which is the first step to capitalizing on them. I now find myself regularly thinking in terms of the strengths concept when making working decisions.  By the way, you don't have to read \\"First, Break All the Rules\\" before reading this book.  In fact, I recommend this one first!  Also, \\"First\\" focused on the manager and how he/she should think and act differently in terms of the authors discoveries on talents and strengths whereas \\"Now\\" focusses on the individual. <br />This book was also the first book that I've read that included an on-line component. The on-line test took me about 30 min to complete and gave me my top 5 strengths. After reading the detailed descriptions in the book, I believe the test correctly hit 4 out of 5 with the 5th one a close runner-up.<br />STRENGTHS: The book is easy to read and full of examples. I found the concepts and content very well thought out and very effective at changing my thinking.<br />WEAKNESSES: I note some weaknesses, but they were at most annoying and not significant enough to prevent me from enjoying or highly recommending the book. First, as in the \\"First\\" book, no index. Second, while the book has lots of examples, a number seemed to be thrown in to touch popular or emotional topics rather than being solid support for the specific topic being discussed.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: The book is probably best suited to professionals and knowledge workers with an interest in better understanding themselves and those around them.

The book is excellent at debunking common managment myths and assumptions.  How do you become a great manager?  Well, since management is a practice and a discipline, and not personality, it can be learned and taught.  Thus, the concept of this book which is: If you want to become a great manager, study them, learn what they do that makes them great, then emulate them.  The authors found out by surveys and research what makes great managers and put the results in here.  This book will make you a better manager and help you increase the effectiveness of those whose performance you are responsible for.  It may even help you learn more about yourself.  This is not just a book to be read, but studied and put into effect.  Many serious managers will want to read it more than once.<br />STRENGTHS:  The content - this is not just a theoritical book, it is very practical for helping you to become a better manager.  The concepts are simple, but powerful and the book is easy to read.  Could become a management classic.<br />WEAKNESSES:  I hate it when books, like this one, don't include an index.  Another gripe is that the authors should have given credit to Peter Drucker for a number of the key concepts.  For example, &quot;focus on strengths&quot; and &quot;management by outcomes&quot; are classic Drucker.  Lastly, I found the repeated references to the surveying techniques and statistics a little annoying.

Drucker's books are always full of great thinking and great content, but I'm not sure that this book is for everyone interested in Peter Drucker (at least it's not one that I'd recommend first).  First of all, the idea of distilling Drucker's work into a single book of material is hard for me to accept because he has so much great material that was already written fairly concisely (though there some overlap in his works).  Does having the Essential Drucker mean you can read it and skip the original books?  Certainly not if your serious about becoming a more effective person/executive.  It is sort of like picking one Shakespeare or one Mozart, you'll get a good piece of work, but you're still missing a whole lot of important stuff.<br />     Anyway, I think there is a couple situations for which this book will be especially useful.  First, it may be most valuable to people (like me) who have read a number of Drucker's books.  In essence, the Essential Drucker can act as a short refresher on many of Drucker's important concepts without having to go back and reread all of the original books.  For this purpose the book was highly valuable to me.  Also, the book may be valuable to those that have read a little Drucker and want to read more, but are unsure which of his many books to start with.  Since the introduction lists the book that each chapter was originally published in, you can easy go to the source to expand upon something that interests you.  However, for the reader that's fairly new to Drucker, why not go to the source and read something like Management Challenges for the 21st Century, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, The Practice of Management, or The Effective Executive.  No matter what you choose you'll get great content related to the theory and practice of management.  A final comment, an interesting approachto reading the Essential Drucker would be to read each chapter and then guess what year the chapter was written.  In many cases, I think the answer will surprise.<br />STRENGTHS:  As always, you get great content from one of the world's great thinkers on management, organization, and society.  His writing is very concise, to-the-point, and sprinkled with real life examples.<br />WEAKNESSES:  Some people are put-off by his very matter-of-fact writing style.  He knows when he's right and rarely hedges his statements.  Also, those needing fancy diagrams and graphics to learn material will be put off, because there are none.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  For the reasons stated above, I'm recommending this book mainly to those who are interested in Drucker's management writings and who are already familiar with some of them.  It makes a great refresher.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Other major works by Drucker including, Management Challenges for the 21st Century, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, The Practice of Management, and The Effective Executive.	2001-11-16

Managers	REVIEW:  (Rev of 2nd edition) It is now widely accepted that innovation is a core competence that is required by nearly all organizations.  As a result, many companies have been very successful at generating new innovations. However, generating innovations is just the first step and an excess of innovations in many companies has created a need for good management processes to deal with them.  These are the issues addressed by this book and there may be no other place where these issues are addressed as thoroughly and well as here.  The author provides a thorough review and analysis of each step of the development process from idea to commercial launch.  While the book can be slow reading at times, I firmly believe the author's method of separating the process into stages and providing screening mechanisms between the stage are excellent advice.  Following these methods should lead to: (1) accelerated product development, (2) increased success rate of new products, and (3) a more effective and efficient new products development process.  Accordingly, the book should be especially useful to those managers responsible for portfolios of new products.  If this is you, this book is highly recommended.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book provides a very thorough review and analysis of the new product development process from innovation through to launch.  The author has done a very thorough review of the research in this field and the book does an excellent job of citing other material.  The book also contains an appropriate use of graphics for illustrating some points.<br />WEAKNESSES:  While the book doesn't focus on any particular industry, its teachings are probably most applicable to more traditional product companies (e.g. P&amp;G, DuPont).  Also, (and this maybe an unfair comment for a book targeted at products) the book probably isn't that helpful for innovations in services which may be even more important in modern companies than product innovation (e.g. GE and IBM are currently pushing services).  Another concern, the book is fairly &quot;textbook like&quot; and only those seriously interested in the subject may find it easy/enjoyable to read.  Some passages seem to drag on and I often wished the author would have been more concise and not tried to so thoroughly justify every point.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Product development managers, new business managers, and others responsible for bringing innovations to market should read this book.  Those responsible for _portfolios_ of new products/innovations may especially find this book useful.<br />ALSO CONSIDER:  Jeffrey A Timmons - New Venture Creation; Guy Kawasaki - Rules for Revolutionaries; Peter F. Drucker - Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship	2001-11-15
US	52646617	R9E5AU0Z4ZKA7	0060932902	730202454	Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Brings the Genome Alive in Story-Like Fashion	REVIEW:  This book gives basic genetic lessons in 23 short chapters told in story-like format that are interesting and at times entertaining.  For a number of years, I've wanted to understand the basics of the genome, but I didn't want to have to study a textbook.  This book is the perfect solution.  In explaining the genome, heridity, evolution and related issues, the author uses familiar examples, like cancer, alzheimer's disease, and mad cow disease, etc. (but the book isn't just about diseases).  Ridley is expert at using analogies and at giving just enough detail so that the lay person understands his basic points yet appreciates much of the complexity of the genome and its operation.  While you won't be able to run a genetics experiment after reading this book, you will have a much better appreciation of the effects that our knowledge of the genome will have on our future.  Very highly recommended for those interested in the field.<br />STRENGTHS:  The book is not a text book.  The chapters are relatively short and easy to read.  The author is excellent at using analogy for increasing understanding of difficult/complex material.  Writing style and depth of content perfectly match the target audience.<br />WEAKNESSES:  The book would have benefited greatly from some graphics (at least my version of the book didn't have them).  Some readers may be put off by a reacurring sub-topic in the book that discusses philosophical and ethical issues of our exploration of the genome (however, I also found this discussion interesting).  While there is minimal use of technical words, a glossary would also have been helpful too.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:  Everyone that is not an expert in genetics and would like to understand the basics of the genome, heredity, evolution and related issues.  Those who refuse to believe that our genes play a major role in who we are and how we behave (including personality) will either be converted or will probably dislike what this bookhas to say.	2001-10-31

And this is why many people will want to read this book. It is basically an autobiography of Jack Welch's GE years and does not dwell on deap management theory. Those readers expecting a lot of new business theory or to learn how to repeat Jack's performance by reading about his secret methodology may be disappointed. <br />The management insights that Jack does reveal seem to me to be generally built on fairly well established (but poorly executed) management practices. Jack has just embraced them and used focussed passion coupled with an obsession on people to execute superbly and produce great results. For example, some of his major initiatives could be said to have been derived from existing management principles: 1) \\"No. 1 or 2\\" Jack admits is derived from Peter Drucker, 2)I believe six sigma is derived in part from Motorola, 3) \\"Boundaryless behaviour\\" can said to be based on Peter Drucker's observation that there are no profit centers inside an organization, and 4) Jack was clearly not an early pioneer on \\"E-business\\". Yet he recognized the opportunities and produced results from them. The book probably won't become a classic, but it is still recommended reading for today's and tomorrow's managers and especially those interest in the man himself.<br />STRENGTHS: The book is a fairly easy and interesting read full of anecdotes and insites. It does a great job of showing the management task as art and discipline that can be learned, improved, and mastered rather than as personal charisma or other common stereotypes of leadership.<br />WEAKNESSES: The minor weaknesses of the book relate to Jack's strong, competitive personality (and maybe ego) that show through in his writing. Despite that author's initial disclaimer to read \\"I\\" as meaning \\"we\\" I found Jack's lack of distinction between himself and GE to be minorly annoying. Parts of the book are filled with phrases like \\"I boughtthis $$$$$ company\\" when clearly \\"We\\" is appropriate [I know, I'm nit-picking]. Second (and this is almost excusable in an autobiography) Jack rarely gave the \\"other side\\" of the story when discussing major GE crises. For example, he never explains the EU's reasons for blocking the Honeywell merger, assuming that it is so obviously wrong it's not worthy of explaination.	2001-10-20

I was expecting more of a practical guide useful for those interested in business management and strategy as affected by the emerging information/knowledge economy and society. That's not what this book is about.  I agree with the basic premise of the book - that information and individuals must be considered in social context and that blind infoenthusiam will not solve all our problems.  However, the book quickly turns into mostly an academic review of selected parts of the social-information theory world and some emerging issues. It offers selected analysis without synthesis. You may like the book if that's what you're looking for, unfortunately I wasn't looking for that.<br />STRENGTHS: The authors are obviously widely versed and have in depth knowledge of the field. This shows especially in the numerous and detailed footnotes. Also, the book tackles an underappreciated topic in the business world - that social context must be considered when using knowledge and information.<br />WEAKNESSES: As the authors readily admit, the book offers little or no solutions or practical advice for managers/executives that have to deal with the issues raised.<br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: Those who like to think on a more academic level about information and social issues should consider reading this book. This may include information theorists and academics and info technologists.<br />ALSO CONSIDER: Information Rules by C Shapiro & H Varian<br />[feedback welcome]	2001-10-17
