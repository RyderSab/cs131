US	49836854	R142IS2KJ2SBZH	0811834905	825017331	Ruby's Wish	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A vivid tale of good fortune, perseverance and familial love	Ruby is a little granddaughter of an old man who \\"struck it rich\\" in California (and lived to tell the tale).  His wealth is such that he takes on many wives (a sign of wealth and privilege in Old China), has many sons (a sign of good fortune) who in turn take many wives, and ends up with over one hundred grandchildren.  He arranges for a tutor to teach any who want to come (even the girls, going against the traditional customs) and is surprised to see that little Ruby (so named because she defiantly wears celebratory red even when there is no holiday) is the grandchild with the most promise.  Long after all the other girls drop off and are married away, she persists with her lessons, even though it means that she must work late into the night on her \\"wifely\\" arts like embroidery.  As hard as she works, she is keenly aware that tradition will soon force her to give up her studies and marry.  When her grandfather is made aware of her unhappiness and asks her to explain, he listens but says nothing.  What will happen next may not be much of a surprise, but the twist at the end is sure to bring a smile to the face of the reader.<br /><br />This story \\"works\\" on many levels.  The bright palette of the book makes Ruby pop off the page.  The illustrator does a good job of showing Ruby progress from quietly curious to defiant yet resigned.  The restraint of the illustrator is as evident as the skill.  The point of the story is of course powerful and poignant: most girls in Old China as well as many places in the modern world are trained to be only wives and mothers at the expense of opening the world to them through reading and writing.  While her grandfather's benevolence shields her from that fate, the author still shows the subtle ways in which a young child would understand what her expected role was.  However, she manages to do it without beating the point with an age-inappropriate hammer.<br /><br />This is a great story that ages five and older will be touched by.y.	2005-09-16

Both my husband's and my ancestors were Jews who left Russia after enduring centuries of discrimination and danger.  As our children get older and time creates more distance between us and what our ancestors suffered, I find myself seeking out these stories so that they can appreciate just how privileged a life we lead now.<br /><br />This is the perfect story to make that point.  Without any hint of adult indignation or politics, the author tells the story from the point of view of the young girl who has to watch as her brother's nose is measured to see if he can go to school (he can't); who knows that her parents have to stay and work in one section of town because they are Jewish but does not understand why; who is desperate to learn and escape from an illiterate destiny as a shopkeeper; and who listens in childhood terror to a man broken as a boy by the czar's soldiers, for the sole \\"crime\\" of being Jewish.<br /><br />The book is also honest about the Masha's/Mary's believable childhood desires.  At one point, she encounters a wealthy non-Jewish Russian.  When asked what she wants, she thinks to herself that she wishes she could have her hair and shoes.  Adults would probably be too proud to admit to such things, but a child would not- and thinking those things under those circumstances doesn't make her any less Jewish or at all ashamed of such.<br /><br />The most touching parts of the story are the interactions with her beloved father and her less seen but equally devoted mother.  Though forbidden by Russian law to go to school, her father takes her deep into the woods to read the five books they own.  Later, when her father leaves for the United States to make a better life for them, her mother works to secure the best life she can for her children.  The most heartbreaking moment in the book comes when Masha, her mother and brother finally leave Russia; in doing so, they also say goodbye to her older sister, whom Masha will never see again.<br /><br />The streets of America are not, of course, paved with gold, and Masha lives in a hot tenement near drunks and dope addicts.  However, she remains studious and ambitious, taking shelter in school and in her parents' support.  By the end of the story, she has mastered her new language well enough to have a poem published in the Boston Globe.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story that, although set in the past, can resonate with younger readers, because although it is not 1894, there are still plenty of hardships both natural and man-made that people must overcome.der sister, whom Masha will never see again. <br /> <br />The streets of America are not, of course, paved with gold, and Masha lives in a hot tenement near drunks and dope addicts.

Not that there is anything wrong with the suburbs, but there is no need to feel like you have to rush out to move once you find out a baby is on the way.  You and your child can have it all in the city.<br /><br />The book deals with such wide ranging topics as space (which is almost always at a premium in urban meccas), safety, entertainment and education.  I thought they had great ideas about how to best utilize your limited space, with respect to both minimizing \\"stuff\\" and storing what you do have.  (An experienced parent might not need it, but sometimes it's nice to have permission not to buy toys and such like crazy.)  While they did comment on ways to minimize your child's risk from strangers, the bulk of their safety passages dealt with commonplace concerns, like getting around in traffic with toddlers.  The book overflowed with ideas about how to entertain your child and yourself, from ethnic areas to festivals to classes to rainy day projects.  They also had a number of websites where the reader could obtain more information about classes, activities and festivals.<br /><br />The information on education was comprehensive, touching on many aspects of private schools, public education and some options in between.  I had the definite impression that the authors were more pro-private than public, which is fine, but that is something that is only available to more affluent readers.  However, it's hard to argue with the flaws they point out for public schools (e.g., a lack of programs available for the gifted).  Again, they provide many resources for parents to do their own research in addition to listing several notable public programs.<br /><br />This was a great, but not exhaustive resource.  Also, this isn't geared to doing things on the cheap (not that it's advertised as such, but many urban parents, including myself are always looking for ways to save).  I would LOVE to see something like this for each major city, but this is a great jumping off point.ays to save).

Pious Yosef and his equally devout mother make expensive arrangements to secure a rest on the sabbath, but Yosef is betrayed when Friday afternoon rolls around.  Despite the danger to himself- and the certain delay- Yosef stays in the desert to observe the sabbath- and is then joined by the mysterious lion.<br /><br />As the mother of Jewish children, I appreciated this story because it highlights the importance of the simple but vital rituals of the sabbath.  Yosef and his family are very poor, but also very hardworking.  Throughout, the story reinforces that Yosef and his family can persevere despite their trials because of the restoration and sense of family that taking this rest brings.  Obviously, I would hope my children and others would not have to risk their lives to observe the sabbath, but I think it's important to have stories with child-heroes who are rewarded for their faith.  I recommend this story for parents and children curious about the sabbath and why it is observed.	2005-08-08

She's taken all of that and translated many familiar exercises to the stability ball (as well as invented a few of her own).<br /><br />Gillies' training in anatomy and years of instruction really show here.  She uses clear, descriptive language as well as many tips and cues that immediately help the reader figure out what muscles they should (and shouldn't) be activating.<br /><br />While there are a lot of books out there for the stability ball (both Pilates-based and \\"gym-style\\"), this book does manage to break some new ground.  The sections that use handweights and her dance-based exercises are very different from anything else out there- Gillies' deserves credit for her innovativeness and originality.<br /><br />The book itself is very attractive, with glossy photography and clear sherbet tones.  It's a joy to read through and follow along with.  She's also created ten different easy to follow exercise menus to choose from if you need a quick reference (I certainly do).<br /><br />The only drawback is that this is low on yoga-based exercises- not a big deal, but it is mentioned in the title.  However, I think someone using this book will find more than enough to make up for that.	2005-05-25

Four orphaned sisters surmise that they need to hide their identities to thrive in a man's world.  They go their separate ways, and seven years later return to their mother's grave as a tailor, a hunter, a finger artist and a star gazer.  Together, they combine their skills to win jobs at the king's court, and in the course of their service rescue a princess and her four brothers and end up living happily ever after.<br /><br />The winking starts when the king's mother realizes that the servants are women but can't prove it because the sisters outwit her- not by playing into her stereotypes, but by playing the part and not playing the part.  The mother, though she knows she is right, shows compassion and leaves off her pursuit.  The princess, however, the seeming damsel in distress, figures it out and proves it quickly (but I won't tell how!).<br /><br />This entertaining fairytale is a good story on its face but will also provide slightly older readers (ages 7 and up) with the opportunity to talk about gender roles and stereotypes.	2005-04-19

While she may have a meatier part than her husband, I see this story as more of a tale of partnership than a \\"good woman\\".<br /><br />In the opening of the story, the sensitive princess weeps when the young beggar, already an object of public scorn, is mistreated by her servants.  Later that year, her father laughingly threatens that he will marry her off to the same boy if she doesn't develop a thicker skin.  Still very sensitive, she retreats into her world of fairy tales and legends.  When her father arranges a marriage- safe but confining- she desperately holds him to his word about a marriage to the beggar.<br /><br />The best part of the story is what happens after the two are married.  While the changes the princess imparts on the beggar are most noticeable- he goes from being mocked and isolated to being admired- the changes their marriage brings to the princess are equally powerful.  With more control of her fate, the princess no longer quietly weeps and retreats from the world, but now opens it up for others.<br /><br />The illustrations for the story are well done- well colored and evocative of the appropriate emotions (despair, isolation, hope and triumph).  I look forward to reading more from Ms. O'Brien.	2005-02-16

The story, though short, evolves slowly.  Yoshiko breaks a taboo and speaks to a foreign man; her GI sweetheart, forbidden to meet her family, nevertheless learns about her world and quietly shows his honorable intentions with thoughtful tokens (fish for her father's pond, wine and rice for the family shrine and, most importantly, learning to speak and write in Japanese).  Because of his patience and earnestness, Yoshiko's family is eventually won over.<br /><br />The best part of the story is on the last page- you'll have to see to figure out why.	2005-02-01

At the beginning of the story, he idolizes the way of life his father and friends lead.  His father, however, is nervous about the future of the Chinese opera in the new world, and steers his son towards excellence at school.  His grandfather, however, secretly teaches Wei how to sing.  The crucial difference between Wei's father and grandfather is that the former always sings the male roles and the latter always the female.<br /><br />After his grandfather leaves, Wei is forced to see the downside of his father's job and what the opera's fading popularity might mean to his father and his own future.  At the end of the story, Wei is able to save the day (or at least the performance), but the reader is left uneasy about Wei's (and his community's) future.<br /><br />Though the author does not belabor the issues, he does drop hints about immigration, prejudice and class differences.  While these might be lost on a younger reader, they will provide food for thought (and hopefully discussion) for the slightly older reader.	2005-01-30

The themes of prejudice, longing, isolation, determination and courage are woven together into a story of forbidden love between a merman and a human woman.  He is transformed into a man, but must touch the sea everyday or he will die; she loves him, but must stay away because of the prejudices borne of a family tragedy.  It's a well-told story that really does leave you guessing until the very last page whether the ending will be happy or tragic.<br /><br />The author has wisely chosen not to use words for everything in the story but rather lets the illustrator fill in the blanks with haunting portraits of emotion, some of which are more abstract than others.  While you know from the brief introduction that they have taken license with their original material, you can't help but feel by the end of the story that the original authors would approve.	2005-01-23

This story, however, has just sparked an interest.<br /><br />Joseph Campbell postulated years ago that Iran/Iraq was the starting point for much of Western (and some Eastern) mythology and culture.  This story has elements of the stories of Cupid and Psyche, Perseus and Medusa, Moses and celestial/divine sun and moon twins.  It also has enough \\"What?!?\\" moments to intrigue- but not confuse- the young reader (not to give anything away, but remember puppies and mice as you read).  It also isn't morally perfect- although there is a neat happy ending, the reader is left wondering whether all of the characters in the story were treated justly.  Again, not enough to inspire indignation, but perhaps enough to ask \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />The book is richly illustrated on backgrounds of muted colors interlaid with lush depictions of characters and places.  The style it reminded me the most of was exaggerated late Medieval art, but of course also Persian and even some Indian art (both of which I am much less familiar with).<br /><br />My five-year-old and I loved this story, and my more jaded ten-year-old was transfixed by it as well.  Anyone of any age interested in world mythology or plain old great storytelling should take a look.	2004-11-28

By the author's description, you get the feeling that even if she doesn't have a perfect verbal command of English, she understands perfectly what is said to and about her and her shabby clothing.<br /><br />Worlds apart is Peggy, the popular rich girl in her class.  After Wanda makes an attempt to fit into a conversation by talking about her beautiful dresses, Peggy begins what seems like a game to her and taunts Wanda daily in front of a crowd of classmates about all of the beautiful dresses in her closet.<br /><br />Bridging their world is Maddie, Peggy's best friend.  While she isn't isolated by a language barrier and has Peggy's unspoken social protection, she is uncomfortably aware that her poverty makes her more similar to Wanda than Peggy.  While Maddie gratefully accepts Peggy's castoffs, she is terrified of the power Peggy's generosity gives her.  The daily game of picking on Wanda continually hardens Maddie's uncomfortable vulnerability; she is keenly aware that speaking out in Wanda's defense could put her in Wanda's place.<br /><br />The \\"truth\\" is that Wanda does have 100 dresses, just not the kind Peggy has.  The moment where Wanda shyly makes her fateful declaration is possibly the most poignant in the whole book.  Of course she must have known that people would wonder why someone with so many beautiful dresses would always wear the same shabby one.  Did she naively, hopefully think that someone would ask her about them and maybe let her into their world?  Instead, she was met with nasty assumptions and taunting.<br /><br />The book ends on a melancholy note.  Maddie (and perhaps Peggy) become better people as a result of what happens to Wanda and her family, but Maddie (and the reader) are haunted by Wanda's unkown fate.  Like Maddie, we can only hope for the best.	2004-11-26

Applegate writes that she started using the ball herself as part of her recovery from a shoulder injury and then surgery and felt that she was in the best shape of her life afterward.  This is a common story, but very impressive coming from someone who used to compete in triathalons.<br />If you've done strength training before, have any experience with ball workouts or yoga or Pilates, you may find the exercises she details for the first two weeks less challenging.  The exercises for the next two phases of the program (weeks three and four and then weeks five and six) are more demanding.  I worked up a sweat on the core exercises and then humbly admitted that I wasn't ready for a few of them.  While \\"sexier\\" is highly subjective (I just hate when fitness books promise that), I have no doubt that one will be firmer and functionally stronger if they stick with the program for the prescribed six weeks.<br />This book doesn't rate a perfect five-stars, unfortunately.  The book spent more time than I would have liked on nutrition and the \\"dessert diet\\".  While I found Applegate's overall approach sensible, I also thought it was a little bit simplistic.  Also, I felt that the \\"workbook\\" section she provided to track the six-week progress was too much- I would have preferred a sheet to copy, or maybe a reference to a website.  The workbook section was almost 100 pages, and some of it could have been cut down.  Also, while I appreciate that she took the time to add customized routines for various athletics, most of them were two or three exercises.  In addition, Applegate could have (and should have) included more stretches to use with the ball.  Finally, and this was most troubling to me, I didn't like that she seemed to play into the stereotype that women will \\"bulk up\\" by using heavy weights in order to convince her readers to use the heavy balls instead of dumbbells- or her ball program instead of traditional strength training.  While some women will bulk up, most will not, and many women don't necessarily find that look unattractive.<br />In summary, this a good reference guide for ball exercises and programs, but you may want to take some of the other information with a grain of salt.convince her readers to use the heavy balls instead of dumbbells- or her ball program instead of traditional strength training.

This book is not going to make you a &quot;master&quot; of any one of these techniques, but that's exactly the point: you don't need to be highly skilled to make a profound change for yourself (or eventually others).<br />As a long-time yoga practitioner, I was always very interested in the chapters on movement, breathing and relaxation, but for some reason resented reading the information on massage.  Once I finally hunkered down and gave the techniques a try, I was amazed at the difference I noticed almost immediately in terms of stiffness and energy levels.  I was even aware of some sensations in my organs, particularly my kidneys.  This has now become my favorite part of the self-healing &quot;practice&quot;.<br />This is an inclusive blue-print for health maintenance (or improvement).  It gives techniques and then variation for all of them, but it demands neither that everything listed be done or that they be done in a particular order.  Jahnke stresses several times that the person using the techniques should tailor them as needed.  Also, over time the techniques used will change.  He also gives permission for people to find other kinds of exercises and modalities that are useful.  The motto seems to be &quot;If it works, use it.&quot;<br />I particularly enjoyed Jahnke's chapter on relaxation.  Meditation is something that yoga and qigong practitioners can, ironically, get very anxious about.  The &quot;ultimate&quot; goal in many traditions is enlightenment, and it's humbling not to get there (time and time again).  Jahnke tries to alleviate that anxiety by stressing that the goal here is relaxation, not enlightenment (although he does still leave the door open).<br />He takes the same soft tone in the chapter on massage.  True, the system of acupuncture is vast and (rightfully) takes years to study and master.  Jahnke, however, waves much of that off, advising the reader to instead focus on the degree of the sensation experienced rather than obsessing over the &quot;correct&quot; point.  For what it's worth, as mentioned above, I have tried the method his way, and I noticed an immediate difference in how I felt.<br />What I found most compelling were his ending chapters where he discussed the potential of self-healing done in a group setting.

In a nutshell, many people who are curious about yoga and want to take advantage of its physical benefits are either intimidated or turned off by what they perceive to be the rest of the &quot;yoga lifestyle&quot; and feel as if Yoga with a capital Y is an all-or-nothing proposition.  To the extent that Shaw's book opens the door for those people, I applaud her.  I also find her statement that she feels she has a mission to contribute to society by sharing yoga admirable.<br />However, I feel like she unnecessarily insults &quot;traditional yoga&quot; several times in the course of the book.  For instance, she writes in her preface, &quot;What separates YogaFit from other forms of yoga is that YogaFit speaks directly and without pretensiousness to everyone, but especially to the needs of amateur and professional athletes.&quot;  And later in the same paragraph, &quot;...YogaFit holds the answers to all of these [sports-training] problems without boring you to death.&quot;  Reading these words, I can't help but get the impression that Shaw is convinced that she is the only one who can deliver the goods to athletes and fitness enthusiasts; Baron Baptiste will be interested to hear that.<br />One of the other notable aspects of the book is that Shaw can't seem to decide whether YogaFit is a form of yoga or something else altogether.  She refers to it as an accessible, demystified form of yoga, then later has a full page chart contrasting the difference between YogaFit and yoga.  Curious, since she went to great pains several years ago to have her training program recognized by Yoga Alliance, a registering body of yoga instructors and schools.<br />The most glaring inconsistency presented by the book is that while Shaw's focus is clearly on the postures, her instructions are lacking.  While I don't think one needs to spend paragraphs describing how to enter and hold a pose, some things are worth mentioning, like hip placement in the warriors and not locking your elbows in postures such as Tabletop and Upward Dog.  Finally, the instructions that she gives for some of the sequences are difficult to understand in some places, and she appears to work sides unevenly (for example, in the YogaFit Classic sequence, you're doing more Pyramids on one side than another).<br />Having said all of that, I do like the postures that she chose- most of them are basic and appropriate enough for both beginners and more advanced students.s to spend paragraphs describing how to enter and hold a pose, some things are worth mentioning, like hip placement in the warriors and not locking your elbows in postures such as Tabletop and Upward Dog.

In succint (if not always fluid) text, Joseph Pilates outlines the intentions of the legendary exercise system he designed as well as how each exercise should be performed.<br />This is a simple, short manual.  It's surprising that a system that has ended up being shrouded in so many mysteries and rules, particularly by those who are in his direct &quot;lineage&quot;, started out relatively humbly.  Many, many Pilates instructors will tell you that if you can't take a class in Pilates (and usually in an expensive studio), you're probably doing it wrong (and then maybe it's not worth doing).  Also, many instructors have argued that most people aren't ready to do the matwork and that they should almost always begin with sessions on the equipment (again, under the watchful and expensive eye of an instructor).  Pilates, however, writes that his system should help you &quot;Return to Life&quot; at a minimum of cost and time.  The tone of his writing is inclusive- his system should be readily available to everyone.  While he does insist that the instructions he sets out should be followed and that one shouldn't move on until all previous exercises are mastered, I'm not sure that the man who wrote this book in 1945 would approve of the elitist tone that some of his modern-day disciples have adopted.<br />It's interesting to note some of the exercises that are not included in the book.  For example, the five-part Stomach Series is one of the most famous sequences in the modern Pilates matwork.  Here, however, Pilates only includes the first two exercises (the One Leg Stretch and the Double Leg Stretch).  Also, the matwork system is also well-known for the Side Kick Series.  Here, Pilates only includes the Side Kick- none of the other now-common five, six, seven, etc. variations.  Were these not included because they hadn't been invented yet or because they were deemed too difficult?  Not sure, but he does include the more difficult variations for exercises like the Corkscrew.<br />The instructions for each exercise are simple and (for the most part) easy to understand.  That said, it is easy to understand why many Pilates instructors could get overly wordy on some of the movements.  Many of the exercises he demonstrates put a lot of pressure on the neck.  I wouldn't necessarily advise that this be the only Pilates reference or manual someone uses to learn the movements.<br />In addition to the instructions for the Contrology matwork, Pilates also shares his thoughts on the importance of proper diet, sleep and relaxation.  After reading this twice, I would say that his primary concern was a lack of good circulation.  He explains that his system was designed to promote just that (and that's part of the reason almost none of the movements are done standing), and he even has suggestions for the proper way to clean the body such that the skin can breathe (answer: dry-brushing).<br />While some of Pilates writing style may be off-putting to modern readers, he comes across as a man who would like to make the world a better place, one body at a time.  If perhaps a little too strident at times, his motivation seems both benevolent and sincere.lude the more difficult variations for exercises like the Corkscrew.<br />The instructions for each exercise are simple and (for the most part) easy to understand.

Please understand- basic does not necessarily translate to beginner or easy.  I have used this sequence with some of my classes and while there are some postures that most people do not feel a Herculanean challenge in, there is no one who feels that this sequence is a walk in the park.<br />I believe most people are going to come to this book for a sequence grounded in a solid anatomical understanding of the body and the effects of common yoga postures and breathing techniques on the body.  While this book does that, it also presents a framework upon which one can build one's own total yoga practice- incorporating mantra and meditation as well as breathing and posture.  Stiles has a way of writing about both the very scientific and very spiritual at the same time and bringing the concepts together in such a way that one wonders why one ever thought of them as distinct in the first place.<br />Though the practice he outlines is very valuable, his suggestions for body reading and use of the asanas for addressing postural problems makes this manual stand out.  In addition to evaluating standing posture, he also outlines a 21-movement Joint Freeing Series.  While a useful diagnostic tool, it is also a satisfying practice on it's own (if one's mobility or stamina is compromised) or in conjunction with the asanas.  He also outlines six Spine Freeing exercises which can aid in gently increasing mobility of the spine.<br />If you want the nitty gritty anatomical detail of why yoga &quot;works&quot;, this isn't your book.  Check out Couler's Anatomy of Hatha Yoga for that.  However, this book will give most readers the level of detail that they need to understand their own physical issues and how yoga can help them.	2004-04-30

It is not going to teach you how to be an Alvin Ailey dancer (sadly).<br />According to the brief history and description of the Alvin Ailey style, the company borrows from a diverse range of techniques, everything from ballet, jazz, modern (specifically the work of Lester Horton, Katherine Dunham and Martha Graham), to African, Caribbean, Indian and West African traditional dance.  In addition to studying movements from those techniques, Alvin Ailey dancers also use movements borrowed from yoga and what is referred to here as &quot;body conditioning&quot;.  Again, you're not going to learn any of those styles of dance here, but the influences on the exercises are apparent.<br />The book is divided into Warm-Ups, Posture and Alignment, Stretch, Strength, Balance and Coordination, and Relaxation and Rejuvenation.  The full program is said to take 60 to 90 minutes, but options for shorter programs (20 to 30, as well as 7 to 10) are also offered.<br />What I enjoy the most about this book is the emphasis on a loosening of the spine combined with the need to constantly stretch.  Some of the stretches, while nothing revolutionary, are a nice twist on some traditional yoga postures, and I've started using some of the warmups before I begin my Pilates practice.<br />Much of the Strength section will be familiar to those who have been exposed to Pilates and ballet, and the Balance and Coordination session borrows heavily from dance and yoga.  They lost me a little bit on the cool down, where they have one move where you might end up literally running around your room (how is this cooling?) but otherwise I liked almost all of the exercises in this section.<br />The photographs were very warm and clear- it was very easy to see what the dancers/models were doing, and the setting (a white living room/studio) looked like a nice place to workout (that setting seems to be the trend these days).  The dancers themselves, while of course thin, trim and flexible, seemed to have more attainable bodies than those featured in many other dance books.  It was also nice to see a very ethnically diverse group.<br />This is not an overly strenuous, straining workout, and you would probably want to supplement some other work for the upper body (do dancers really only use pushups to develop their arms?).  However, it is a relaxing workout with an emphasis on alignment and spinal articulation.  A nice compliment to yoga and Pilates workouts.ke a nice place to workout (that setting seems to be the trend these days).

I've been a Pilates believer since I took the Pilates challenge a few years ago.  Indeed, in 30 sessions, I had muscles I'd never known about, as well as being overall stronger and more limber (and I was pretty limber to start with).  Many people, of course, are quick to dispute the claim, although they've never tried it themselves, and many others don't want to devote the two months/ten days necessary to achieve the results.<br />The Pilates Promise shows three realistic bodies taking up the challenge.  Better yet, Ungaro created three different programs, one for Upper Body, one for Lower Body and one for Flexibility and Posture.  I liked her choices, especially since 1) most people think of Pilates as a glorified abdominal workout and 2) a lot of people hold that it's not possible to use Pilates to improve your upper body (and sometimes lower body).<br />Each program is a derivative of the classic Pilates mat sequence.  Only the most advanced movements (the JackKnife, the Underwater Series, the Rollover, etc) are not included in the programs she designed.  She also includes the Standing Sculpting Series/Arm Series, the Rowing Series and some movements with the Magic Circle.<br />All of the participants came into the program with real bodies and left the program with real bodies.  However, the participants did get their desired results.  For example, the woman who wanted to improve her upper body gained 1/2 an inch in her deltoids, 1/2 an inch in her biceps and 1 inch in her bustline (while also losing 1 inch from her waistline).  (While those results may not impress someone trying to build significant mass, Ungaro notes that in the absence of serious weight training most women are going to have difficulty gaining large muscle mass.)  The woman who wanted to improve her lower body lost 2 inches in her waist, 2 1/2 inches in her hips, 2 1/4 inches in her upper thighs and 3 1/4 inches in her lower thighs.  The most dramatic results were from the woman trying to improve her posture and flexibility.  Though she changed her proportions somewhat, the overall improvement in her range of motion is what was most impressive.<br />If you're looking for dramatic \\"Body for Life\\" results, this is not the program for you.  This is not a weight-loss program (though I wonder if that's Ungaro's next book?) and changing one's diet for the program is never suggested.  In fact, at one point one of the participants notes that she made a conscious decision not to change her diet while pursuing the program.<br />As with Pilates: Body In Motion, this book is very easy to read and follow.  Ungaro uses color coded charts for each program and then includes all of the exercises used in the book in the sequence they would be traditionally performed.  As a bonus, she also includes charts for four time-crunched Pilates workouts, the Side Kicks Series, the Arm Series, the Abdominal Series and the Wall Series (all of which take about five minutes).  Finally, for those of us who have always wondered how to incorporate the Pilates \\"extras\\" like the weights and the circle, she discusses that as well (matwork, then circle, then weights).<br />A lot of times when reading other Pilates books, I always feel a little let-down when we get to the part about the specialized equipment- like somehow the reader is going to miss the boat if they can't run out and get everything.  While Ungaro does suggest the use of items like weights, rubber bands, circles and poles, she also lists alternatives- just in case you're not able to run out and buy a Pilates Magic Circle.<br />This is a great follow-up to Pilates: Body In Motion and will help guide both new and veteran participants to get the realistic results they want on their own.rove her posture and flexibility.

She veered too far into the wordy side at times, and I could see how absolute beginners could find her intimidating.<br />This kit is a great follow-up or add-on to her book.  Her instructions for each of the sections are very clear, and the cards that she provides for each movement give just the right amount of information about what you should be thinking about for each exercise.<br />I enjoy the CD format of the workout.  The format makes it very easy to skip over to the section that you want to work on that day without having to skip around as you would in a video.  Much has been made about why Siler would come out with an audio version and not a video or DVD.  Having read interviews that she's given, I know that there are plans to come out with a video.  Frankly, I suspect that she wanted to expand her market cautiously by coming out with an audio version first, which, I believe, would be somewhat less expensive to produce than a video.<br />Also, while some may disagree, I feel that a more advanced Pilates mat workout really requires a visual component.  I would be very nervous about a product that instructed, say, the JackKnife without giving an idea of how it should look.  While that could be gotten across to some extent on flash cards, I think it would be very helpful to see the more advanced movements in motion to give the viewer an idea of the speed and care necessary to use when performing them.<br />While I enjoyed the workouts and recommend them to any Pilates student, I'm giving this four stars instead of five because the constant references to &quot;Authentic Pilates&quot; in the first two or three sections of the CD became very annoying.  Most students acknowledge the superiority of the original method Siler and her mentor teach, but constantly bringing it up don't further convince me, just irritate me.method Siler and her mentor teach, but constantly bringing it up don't further convince me, just irritate me.	2004-03-12

They have been an invaluable resource for me.<br />Although I like to use videos to practice with at home, many times I like to spend more time on postures than some videos allow.  Also, even though I am a yoga teacher, sometimes it's hard to plan the \\"perfect\\" practice for myself.  Though I do \\"yoga on the fly\\" sometimes, it's easy for me to slip into my favorites (e.g., hip openers) and skip over the challenges (e.g., inversions).<br />Whenever I do the practice outlined in the charts, I always feel like I am getting a complete, compact yoga workout.  I think of this as a basic, get-it-all-in practice.  This has also been helpful to me as I work through some of my imbalances, particularly through my hips.<br />While this is not an easy practice, this is not the practice to choose if you want to kick your own butt or burn fat.  However, it's great for alignment and overall well-being.	2004-01-01

I did wince when I first started reading because 1) the author's tone was intimately critical (although it might be a stretch to characterize it as pejorative) and 2) he's British.  Anyone who has read any history of Asia (or Africa, or the Americas) is rightfully concerned when a European (or American) takes such a tone in a book on the history of a colonized nation.  As a person of Korean descent, I was immediately keen to this potential lack of objectivity.<br />However, I found the book very valuable.  All of the historical facts that Breen cited can be backed up by Lee Ki-Baik's Korea Old and New (although of course the interviews and anecdotes I can't account for).  I thought this book was an excellent compliment to Old and New because it gave a personal narrative to the history (although, of course, I would be very interested in reading a similar item from a Korean).<br />But history is not the ultimate focus of the book.  Breen is more concerned with the future of Korea, or rather the two Koreas.  What is ironic is that while he notes (with some tone of criticism) a Korean tendency to speak wishes as if they were facts, he seems to close with a similar, rosy sentiment about how the Koreas might come together.<br />I certainly felt that while he looked at Korea with a critical eye, he did so in large part because he truly cared for the country and it's people.	2003-07-18

What a find.  Robin Rhee tells old, familiar stories, but still manages to leave the reader with a question mark at the end.  Some of the stories are humorous, and a few are brutal.  Some show how traditional beliefs gave Koreans the strength to move forward despite centuries of invasion, others show how these beliefs could very often turn against the people they were intended to protect.<br />Although all of the stories were well-written, my favorites were \\"Are There Tokkaebi?\\", \\"Life, Death and Susok\\", \\"Mi-suk's Treasured Secret\\", \\"Wedding Ducks\\" and \\"The Manchu Invasion\\".  Taken together, all of the stories in this book will give insight into the traditional Korean mind (and perhaps the modern one as well).	2003-05-10

I had been warned about the \\"chatty\\" style and the lack of focus, but I was intrigued enough about the subject itself to overlook those potential flaws.  I used to belong to a CSA Farm, so the subject of sustainable and responsible agriculture is close to my heart.<br />The style of writing did not bother me.  Although she does seem at times to meander in the early chapters, she has quite a few complicated and inter-related subjects to cover: the purchase of her first home, the purchase of her new home, the development of her commitment to self-sufficient agriculture (or something close to it), and the death of her husband. Once those subjects are covered, I found the book became clearer and more linear (for better or worse).<br />Most of what she says I can't argue with.  I agree that there is something fundamentally wrong with a food production system that makes it more affordable for we Northeasterners to buy food shipped in from California than to buy food from our own home states.  When she describes the system as essentially a lot of fuel going to ship cold water, one has to want to reevaluate their food choices.<br />I found myself nodding in agreement when she talked about the taste of the foods we have the \\"luxury\\" of being able to buy year round.  Having tasted food right off the farm, I can verify that there is a world of difference between it and the items you find in your store- even if they are \\"in season\\".  Fresh produce does get addictive.  Of course, not everyone has the luxury of having enough land to grow a substantial garden on, as Gussow points out.  She suggests a CSA as an alternative, but that can be an unrealistic commitment for many people as well.<br />...I took puzzled offense to her chapter on vegetarianism.  While I feel that serious gardeners and farmers have a right to protec their crops from \\"varmints\\" and that therefore there is a little death in even the most stringent vegan diet, I felt that she completely dropped the ball in her argument against a vegetarian diet.  Throughout the book she drives home that the gasoline used to ship food all over the country contributes to the greenhouse effect that caused her (and most of the country) some of the most erratic summers and winters on record.  In her dismissal of the vegetarian diet, she does not once make mention of the fact that the waste from the livestock is also a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.  She talks about an organization that touted the belief that the planet would return to an Eden-like state if we all stopped eating meat.  Perhaps (although she gives an incomplete argument against that assertion), but the argument I have heard for the last decade is that if everyone in the US cut their consumption of meat by 10%, we would significantly reduce energy consumption and livestock waste- enough to make a difference in the global warming trend she (and I) is so concerned about.<br />That aside, this is a book worth reading if you are interested in sustainable agriculture.  Again, it's not something we'll all be able to do, but it's something we can all participate in.re there is a little death in even the most stringent vegan diet, I felt that she completely dropped the ball in her argument against a vegetarian diet.

I've read it from cover to cover and I was blown away by the amount of information Coulter presents.  He doesn't make references to specific schools but presents things very generally.  He also doesn't use too much Sanskrit, so most yoga students shouldn't be too intimidated by the material.<br />The information he presents on Breathing, the importance of the Abdominopelvic muscles (or the &quot;core muscles&quot;, as they're popularly known today) and his chapter on Forward Bends where he discusses nutation were my favorite portions.  Coulter isn't doctrinaire in most cases, as is appropriate for someone discussing the anatomical aspect of yoga.  He presents variations for the popular poses (forward bends, cobra, triangle, etc.) and discusses what the ramifications of the modifications are.  While some are called &quot;advanced&quot; and some are called &quot;beginner&quot;, it doesn't come off as a value judgment.<br />Because Coulter was so thorough throughout the entire book and backed up almost every statement with a logical explanation, it was noticeable when he did not.  For instance, he, like almost every other author of a yoga text, recommends that women not practice inversions if they are menstruating.  Why?  I really hoped that someone with his background would be able to supply an explanation other than because that's the way it's been done.  Also, while he spends quite a bit of time talking about the importance of the right tetrahedron for meditation postures and the various postures that can be used, I felt he glossed over the reasons why meditation has to be done sitting versus lying down.  Minor quibbles, but only more obvious because the rest of the book is so meticulous.<br />If you are planning on teaching yoga, if you already have a yoga practice or if you're not quite convinced that yoga can do anything for your body, pick up this book.	2002-11-02

It gives some solid references to the origins of the Firm, how the original Volume 1 was produced and a glimpse into what their workout philosophy is. Also, although they fall kind of flat with their prescriptions about diet and appearance, there is nothing in there that hasn't been said by many diet and appearance books in the last few years. FYI- the recommendation for black thong underwear is based on 1) their statement that you should wear black year-round (this has been in MANY appearance guides) and 2) the fact that a lot of women complain about panty lines. It's not that controversial.<br />I was put off by the bashing of Richard Simmons and Jane Fonda, and frankly, a little residual jealousy seemed to motivate it. Also, I was shaking my head at the full page of Oprah references- yes, she is a classic yo-yo dieter, but they could have been a little bit more charitable. That is perhaps the biggest problem in their book: they have a number of good points to make, but their biased and undiplomatic delivery makes it hard to take them seriously.

Brooke Siler's Pilates Body, in my opinion, raised the bar for all Pilates books- and so far few have come close.  Jennifer Kries' Pilates Plus Method is VERY comprehensive and tells you more about muscle relationships and breathing patterns than you thought you needed to know, as well as quite a bit about yoga and dance.  However, for the student who wants to learn Pilates (and not yoga or dance), this is the book to use.<br />Ungaro gives a brief description of the origins of Pilates (and hers is slightly more detailed than some of the other accounts) as well as an introduction to Pilates terminology and principles.  READ THESE if you are just starting out.  Also, better than other sources I have read, she explains why some movements are considered \\"Beginner\\" and some are \\"Advanced\\"- good information for anyone who has ever scratched their head when watching a video or following another manual.<br />Then to the body of the book.  She first lays out the Introductory Program, a series of six or seven of the most basic Pilates movements done with modifications.  Then the Beginner's Program, which is exactly the Introductory program only with more traditional form.  For the Intermediate and Advanced programs, she uses guides which show all of the exercises in order.  In addition to being a good quick reference to what sequence to use, it also gives the reader a sense for how each exercise should flow into another.<br />The exercises themselves are explained with photographs linking breathing to each \\"mini movement\\" and just enough text to explain what to do.  The photographs in this book- as well as the pages themselves- are perfect.  Color photographs in muted tones that make it easy to see what you're supposed to do without being distracting.<br />Ungaro also includes Circle and Wall exercises.  These smaller, shorter routines can be incorporated into your day when you don't have time for a full mat workout, or added on to complement it.

US	49836854	R28LCUF2CANQGN	0395978270	253944481	A Single Shard (Newbery Medal Book)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The triumph of merit over tradition	As a second-generation Korean-American, I am grateful to Linda Sue Park for her portraits of historical Korea.  I think when most Westerners think of Korea- or most other countries in East Asia- there is at best a tinge of tragedy in their assumptions.  Due to the Confucian tradition extant in many countries, it is true that one's family was a strong factor in how much one could achieve in life.  The same, of course, can also be said of many European countries at varying times, but Asian countries tend to be viewed through a dimmer lens.<br />As Park points out, homelessness was a rarity in Korea until very recently, but it did exist.  It is also true that the prejudices against the homeless were cruel, and the same is true today in Korea (and the United States).<br />Tree-Ear, though poor, homeless, hungry and young, is also very ethical.  Although his foster-father Crane-Man is crippled and homeless, he has adhered to the traditional code of honor and instilled it into Tree-Ear.  Thus the two are allowed to scavenge through rubbish heaps, but not to steal, beg or otherwise take advantage of others.  This rule extends even to ideas and forms the basis of one of Tree-Ear's dilemnas in the middle of the book.<br />Tree-Ear is also a very hard worker- in fact, while he manages to get by scavenging, he craves hard work.  When the potter Min gives him an opportunity to work off a debt and then to work as a helper (but not quite an apprentice), Tree-Ear is ecstatic.  He enjoys the routine and the feeling of accomplishment he achieves through hard work.  However, his ultimate goal is to become a potter like Min.  Through his dedication and hard work, he ultimately gives Min a reason to see past tradition, prejudice and heart ache.<br />Clearly, I loved the story.  While it may be more of a fairy tale than a historical portrait, Park very cleverly uses references to famous works of celadon pottery.  The one she describes at the end of Tree-Ear's story brought tears to my eyes- you'll have to read it to understand why.<br />Highly recommended for children and adults.yes- you'll have to read it to understand why.<br />Highly recommended for children and adults.	2002-05-14

I have been practicing yoga and Pilates regularly for a little over a year, and I've been \\"dipping my toe in the pool\\" trying to get into dance.  With my knowledge of some of the Pilates basics and using some of the NYC Ballet Workout, as well as some classic yoga moves, I tried to come up with the best way to synthesize the three into one routine. In many cases, I felt like I came up short.  This book does a very nice job combining the three, although the emphasis is cearly on Pilates.<br />Before introducing her full 68 move routine, Kries describes how she was introduced first to dance, then to Pilates and finally to yoga.  In a nutshell, she has been dancing since she was 9, using Pilates since she was 13 and practicing yoga since she was recovering from an injury in her late teens.  Dance provides the body with slenderness and agility as well as an outlet for artistic expression, Pilates with strength and yoga with flexibility, both for the body and the mind.<br />She next discusses the 9 essential elements that are essential in her workout, as well as exercises to help strengthen those elements.  Emphasis in this chapter is on the breathing techniques needed for yoga and Pilates.  She also has a chapter of pre-exercises for all three disciplines to help prepare for the complete workout.  The first, the pre-rollup, is also used as a diagnostic to determine whether you should begin at level 1, 2 or 3.<br />And now the workout.  Of the 68 exercises presented, a little more than half are level 1.  Of the remaining, about 25 are level 2 and 8 are level 3.  In other words, even an absolute beginner should be able to perform the bulk of the workout.  The workout starts with yoga breathing, then moves onto a dance inspired warmup.  Next, and for the majority of the workout, are the classic Pilates exercises, all in (as far as I can tell) the classic Pilates sequence.  She begins with the Hundred and moves through non-stop until Criss-Cross.  At this point, Kries alternates between yoga and Pilates.  After the completion of the abdominal series, leg series teaser series and three variations on the Sun Salutation, she begins the Plie series (this series is very similar to her 3-D Toning tape).  Next is the Pilates Standing Sculpting Series.  Weights are optional, but the suggested range is 3 to 5 pounds.  These exercises do work the entire upper body, but a lot of stress is put on the shoulders.  Therefore, I don't recommend going beyond 5 pounds for this series.  Finally, she begins the relaxation series, consisting of alternate nostril breathing, meditation and the corpse pose.<br />The last two sections of the book have routines designed to improve the performance in eight popular sports as well as two abbreviated versions of the workout, one for Beginners and one for Intermediate/Advanced.<br />Throughout her book, Kries intersperses inspirational quotes (the bulk seem to be from William James).  Clearly, a lot to think about when you're exercising, but they definitely put you in the right mind-set.  Every exercise includes photographs as well as (for almost all of the exercises) an \\"InSight\\" to help you refine your technique and a listing of the muscles used in the exercise.<br />I really enjoy this workout and this is a keeper in my weekly (or more) rotation.  However, a couple of comments:<br />-I would have preferred more yoga.  In her Precision Pilates video, she uses a number of yoga poses in her lowerbody workout that could have been effectively incorporated here (Chair, Lunge variations, etc.).  Also, I feel that she didn't draw out the need to breathe differently for the yoga and Pilates movements.<br />-I would have preferred more dance.  There are not too many repetitions of each of the moves in the Plie series. Minor complaint- this is a book, and one could easily add on another set if desired.<br />+/-Jennifer can be very profound, and judging from other comments about her, this can be very off-putting.  However, I really enjoy her comments and insights.<br />+/-She states that this routine can take 30 to 45 minutes, and after performing this workout three times, it's taking me an hour and a half.  That's down from two hours, so there is some improvement.  Admittedly, much of that is me stopping to look at the sequence as well as referring to each individual exercise to look at the number of reps required.  I read once in Brooke Siler's book (which I really only skimmed) that some advanced students can perform the entire Pilates mat sequence in as little as 15 minutes.  Clearly then, this workout can be done in 30 to 45 minutes, but that in and of itself should be considered a goal.<br />+Many people have questioned the benefits of Pilates for the legs and arms.  I am here to tell you they exist.  After each workout, my legs have been noticeably sorer, but not painfully so.  Also, after using 5 pound weights for most of the Standing Series (but I had to use 3 for the last two), my upper body is definitely feeling it the next day.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who already practices Pilates and who is also interested in yoga or dance.  The yoga and dance sections should be accessible to the beginner, but the Pilates sections may be challenging to the absolute beginners.  I plan on doing this workout 3 times a week, supplemented by some other strength training.  After one week, I already feel the difference in my legs, arms and core.about her, this can be very off-putting.

For instance, even though every Bialystoker she encounters states that you absolutely do not split the roll open, she states that she still continues to do this because she finds it awkward not to.  Fair enough.  However, other variations of the bialy, such as the amount of onion used and the generosity of poppy seeds on top, she seems to feel are intolerable.  And that's fine, too, because what she is really saying- and what just about everyone she interviews is saying- is that the bialy you love best is the bialy you grew up with.  When all is said and done, it isn't about the specific recipe or food as much as it is about the past.  The food you grew up with is one of the strongest links to your past.  This is what Sheraton is really writing about; when the Bialystokers talk about how much they miss the bialy they grew up with and how inferior the modern versions are, what they are really mourning is the loss of the home they lived in.  That the exact method of producing the bialy has been lost is just one more testament to the world that was destroyed in the Holocaust.<br />My mother went to visit my sister in New York recently, and I asked her to bring back some bialys.  Surely the bialys in New York would be better than the bialys I eat here in Boston.  Not even close.  My bialy has definite merits over its New York counterpart (abundant onions and poppyseeds, huge and fat, not flat), but it wasn't simply that.  My bialys are the ones I've grown accustomed to eating and remind me of the neighborhood I buy them in and the people I eat them with.  I cannot imagine losing all of that, and every passage of this book that spoke about those losses brought tears to my eyes.<br />Read this book and fall in love with an old bread and a lost world.a lost world.	2001-11-09

Now that I've more thoroughly reviewed it, however, I think I understand.<br />What I liked about the book initially was the promise of combination moves (or integrative moves) and exercises using medicine and balance balls.  I was introduced to all of these by Gin Miller in her series of articles in &quot;Cooking Light&quot;.  (I strongly suggest going to the Cooking Light website and previewing the Good Moves archives - or picking up the latest edition- for some really innovative ideas.)  I was looking for other exercises in these categories to add to my repertoire, and I was hopeful this would provide some.<br />Unfortunately, I thought many of the combination moves were boring and dull.  I didn't find many of them to be anything special.  I also didn't see very many innovative ways to use the medicine ball, and there weren't that many exercises with the balance ball.  That was disappointing.  I also found the information she presented &quot;lite&quot;; she touched on some interesting topics, but I thought she could have explored most of them in more depth.<br />OK- so maybe this book was geared toward people who haven't exercised in a while or ever.  Fair enough, but then the subtitle &quot;8 Weeks to a Sleek and Sexy Body&quot; is either misleading or an overstatement.  &quot;Sexier&quot;, &quot;sleeker&quot; perhaps- but if you're just starting out, chances are you need more than 8 weeks to get to that point.  Although I was never, say, 40 pounds overweight, 8 weeks into my exercise program I wasn't exactly sleek and sexy- and yes, I did strength train.<br />This is a decent enough book for the beginning exerciser, but don't expect miracles.  12-16 weeks is a more realistic time period to expect to see significant results (and she does offer a 16-week plan).  However, if you have a significant amount of weight to lose, you have to be in this or any other program for the long haul.have to be in this or any other program for the long haul.	2001-11-08

I had to bite my lip when Rochester kissed Jane for the first time.  Charlotte Bronte did an excellent job of creating a flawed, passionate romantic anti-hero that has yet to be rivaled by anyone (although her sister's Heathcliff comes pretty close).<br />Jean Rhys' portrait doesn't rival Bronte's.  Instead, she rips Rochester down so thoroughly that everything that made the &quot;original&quot; appealing is now nauseating.  Her younger Rochester is selfish, spiteful and malicious.  While he cannot be blamed for Antoinette's ultimate descent into madness, he is the one in the book who gives her the last push she needs.<br />This is an extremely depressing book from start to finish.  Rhys makes you attach quickly to the hopeless, friendless girl, and you find yourself hoping along with her that Rochester will be the savior that she imagines him to be, even though you know he can't possibly.  Despite knowing how it's going to end, Rhys' final chapter surprises and (even further) saddens you; though you can't be sure if it's a fantasy or a memory, it's a glimpse into a happier world that was within her reach but for everything else around her.	2001-10-18

Roark is a ... and Dominique is self-destructive.  If I met these two in real life, I wouldn't want to be too close.<br />There is, however, greatness within the both of them.  It's not that Roark has a vision he kills himself towards; he simply knows what is true within him and works that as his guiding principle.  Dominique, for all of her masochistic self-thwarting, is almost uncomprehensibly tragic.  She shares Roark's commitment to truth to one's self but is so shaken and disgusted by the lies and compromises of the real world that she takes it as her duty to punish everyone for it- most of all herself.  In my opinion, the book is really about her, as she is the one who needs to come to the realization that she can live in the world according to her own principles even if they are at odds with everything else.<br />Gail Wynand, Ellsworth Toohey and Peter Keating all cut memorable figures as the tragic, powerful man, the Machiavellian villain and the dupe.  As anti-ideal as Howard and Dominique are, these three make are even less appealing alternatives.<br />Ultimately, this book is a great tool to help one figure out who is a real person and who is a poser.	2001-10-10
US	49836854	RQF9QU2X3SKWG	0684863375	642816339	Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating	Books	5	41	46	N	N	Stunning	I've known since 1991 that the USDA Food Pyramid was compromised by the Dairy and Meat Industries (upon reflection, the fact that the Department of Agriculture published it should have tipped me off that this was always intended to be more of a marketing tool than anything else).  As I've pursued the quest to a healthier me, I've discovered through &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; health books that whole grains are far superior to refined, and through personal experience I've learned that the more vegetables you eat the better.<br />Despite all of this, my jaw still dropped through much of the book.  I was skeptical when Willett touted the benefits of fats (it's half of the base of his new pyramid!), but I was thoroughly convinced by the time I finished that chapter.  We all know that too much of the bad fat is, well, bad for you, but I was surprised that the good fat can actually protect you.<br />What impressed me the most was how non-political and agendaless (that's a word now) Willett was.  Overall, he endorsed a diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, fruits and unsaturated fats.  However, he didn't say an absolute no to meat and dairy, though he did temper that with quite a few warnings.  Also, it's been trendy in the last few years to espouse the virtues of the traditional Asian diet.  As he points out, that diet isn't always so healthy, especially when it isn't coupled with a lot of exercise.  Finally, he provided a good enough argument to convince me to take my vitamins- not as a replacement for a healthy diet, but to hedge my bets.<br />The most important piece of information Willett passed along he (admitedly) spent the least amount of time on: Stay thin and healthy.  I was appalled by his BMI anecdote (the healthy levels for BMI are 25 and below because the real level would have made most of the country overweight).  I suggest the Covert Bailey books as a complement to help you lose the weight (because diet alone won't do it).	2001-10-09

Because Quintus shows the war and the Greek &quot;heroes&quot; in an accurate light.  His most vivid section (and that with the fewest metaphors) comes at the end in the sack of Troy.  He graphically describes the murder of the men, even the elderly.  Neoptolemus, Achilles son, lacks any of the heroism or even pity Achilles had when he happily kills Priam.  The most heartbreaking scene in the entire book is when the Greek soldiers throw Astyanax, the infant son of the dead Hector from the walls of Troy.  I spent the entire book dreading this passage, but I still wasn't prepared for the cruelty of it.<br />Helen, not the most sympathetic character in the history of story telling, is made even worse here.  It is stated in the Iliad and implied here that she was Paris' willing paramour.  However, when Menelaus takes her back, she claims that she was an unwilling victim who tried to end her own life rather than endure her new fate.  When Paris dies, she weeps, but more for herself than for her dead lover.  Quintus doesn't give a clear explanation for why no one thought to turn her over to Menelaus after Paris' death.<br />The biggest flaw of the characters in this book is the over-emphasis on Fate.  Every character suffers when those words come out of his or her mouth.  I believe Quintus was trying to make a point when people excused their actions through fate.  We may be tempted- however briefly- to buy into it when someone as clever (but not very eloquent here) as Odysseus argues his way out of blame through the device of Fate, but when we hear Paris use the same excuse, we know we're being hoodwinked.  Fate here is an excuse for the weak-willed, selfish, jealous or bad-tempered.red.	2001-08-10

It also used the characters in an organic manner speaking clear language and in simple situations to show the social dilemnas and contradictions Korean women- and many other women- had to live with.<br />The book is bittersweet because you are left with the impression that while the main character's abilities and awareness were growing, her possibilities would never again be as great.  She was truly maturing in the sense that she was aware of how small her universe had to be.	2001-07-27

While there are more advantages than disadvantages to living in an age where we can get so much information about anything, it's a relief to read something simple and sensible about exercise and fitness.  Bailey never makes you scratch your head trying to figure out what he means or undermines his own credibility with impossible promises.<br />I also love that the program he outlines is so simple and straight-forward.  In case you can't translate into the latest fitness lingo, he's advocating interval training as the keystone of losing fat (with cross-training and weight-lifting playing a supporting role).  I've been doing all of the above for a while and seeing results, but now I finally understand that it's not a good idea to push myself so far I hurt.<br />Although Bailey is emphatic that this is not a book about dieting or nutrition, again, his good sense comes through even there.  This book is anti-diet in the way the American public has come to understand it.  Bailey doesn't advocate that we eat like pigs and cautions against over-indulgence, but basically advocates a straight-forward eating plan where we stay away from fats and sweets.  He cautions that while exercise is ultimately how we'll stay fit and healthy, we can eventually undermine that if we eat badly.  Again, pretty reasonable.<br />A word of warning: this is not for people who want to look like size 0 supermodels or brawny weightlifters.  This is for people who want to get or stay in good shape and sustain it for the rest of their lives.  He has some very good (and simple) tools for figuring out just how fat you really are and what you should weigh.  A lot of people will be surprised to find they only need to lose 5 pounds, not 15, and that losing that extra 10 will make them less fit, not more.	2001-07-27

She gives a very detailed explanation about the elements in the macrobiotic philosophy and what foods have which elements.  It's complicated to plan your meals around those guidelines, but sometimes it's worth it.  3.

Many of the recipes are delicious, and it's nice to make something that tastes good but that won't give you pangs of food-guilt later.<br />A few caveats:  1. This is not a pure vegetarian cookbook.  She has a whole section on fish.  The author does not eat fish herself, but wanted to more fully represent the macrobiotic philosophy.  2.  This doesn't give a good look at the full spectrum of macrobiotics.  I'm not an expert by any stretch, but from what I've read of some of the other macrobiotics founders, this seemed very incomplete.  She seems to concentrate primarily on the yin-yang principle (in her next book she talks about the elements), but doesn't give a comprehensive overview of how those can affect certain conditions.  Also, as another reviewer pointed out, she includes a lot of ingredients most macrobiotics shun (chocolate, garlic, etc.)  She seems to bend the rules a lot when it comes to desserts.  3.  Having said that, when the author thinks a rule is important, she runs with it.  Don't even think of eating raw vegetables or fruits, any white flour, or certain vegetables, like tomatoes.<br />All in all, I thought this cookbook was a valuable addition to my collection, but I didn't think it was a very good lifestyle guideline.	2001-07-20

I also found the sequence where she planned her &quot;great escape&quot; exciting and suspenseful, even though I knew it would be a success.<br />It is slightly flawed in that the end ties up a bit too nicely, and the tension between the narrator and Helen withers a bit by the time the book ends.  However, the same criticism could probably be made of the other more well-known Bronte books.<br />Overall, definitely worth reading!	2001-07-20

And that is the way the entire book reads.  As soon as you think you have a handle on any of the characters, you learn something new that changes everything.  The result is that it's almost impossible to make a judgment about anyone.<br />Anna, in particular, becomes more tragic just for that reason.  First we see her as the dutiful, virtuous wife of a passionless man.  Then we see her easily corrupted by the decadent Vronsky.  How &quot;good&quot; was she in the first place if she was such a willing victim?  And even though we see in painful detail why she continuously refuses to do the right thing until it's too late, we still find ourselves asking why.<br />Who is avenging themselves on whom, and why?  Some of the answers are obvious, but some are unexpected and make the most righteous characters downright malicious, and the most unsympathetic almost pathetic.	2001-07-20
