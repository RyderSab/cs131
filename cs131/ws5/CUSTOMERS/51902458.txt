First I've read of this author but now am reading others of his.  The only thing that I felt that couldn't make it 5 stars was that I didn't get totally wrapped up in the characters and plots  to the exclusion of everything else in the world as I sometimes do with  other similar authors like Patricia Cornwell.  But, the story line was  great and the characters were great - but could've drawn me in a little  more.  Would make an awesome action movie!	1999-11-24

The humor was great and the story kept getting better.  I hated to see it end.  I didn't want to read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross because they weren't Scarpetta novels, but a friend  insisted and I'm so glad she did!<br />I enjoyed the three main characters  West, Brazil, and Hammer, but found the other characters like Bubba and  Weed quite charming.  As usual, there is the trademark gore and suspense,  but the humor had me hanging on every chapter.  <br />I appreciate Cornwell's  style and intelligent writing style.  I look forward to more in this series  as well as the Scarpetta series.	1999-10-18

The best part of Maeve Binchy's books is the way she slowly unrolls her characters and her stories.  With her short story compilations, she doesn't get to do either so it ends up being lifeless and leaves me unhappy!  Maeve  needs something between her very long novels and her short stories.	1999-07-04

I thought this was the best of the ones by Patricia Cornwell that I have read yet.  I wish I had started at the beginning, but jumping around from novel to novel has been OK too.  I just really like the characters, the way  they grow with each novel and the way they remain true to themselves.   Definitely a must read.

I saw the title on amazon.com and thought it sounded good.  I liked the writing style, the development of the characters, the  setting, and the integrity the author had assimilating the above into a  good story.

For every review of someone saying is was the best book they ever read, there is another saying it is complete garbage.  Amazing.<br />I thought this was a good story.  It was a  little predictable, not terribly imaginative writing, and a little dull in  parts, but a good read altogether.  I found it easy to continue, wondering  what would happen next, not anticipating the ending, and touched by the  characters.  Again, no literature awards, but a good story.

It seems to me that most of them have to do with a victimized woman that you should sympathize with but can't (i.e. Here on Earth).  I bought this one on a whim and have REALLY  enjoyed it!

I read this book several months ago and, with enough distance since the disappointment, I think that he needed to write a social statement.  I am hoping that since it's out of his system, THE TESTAMENT will take us back  to his old style of writing - the style that worked for me.  I vaguely  remember the characters and vaguely remember the plot.  I remember it being  an OK read, nothing I have recommended to anyone.  I was disappointed that  it wasn't more typical of Grisham's style, but I think now upon retrospect,  he needed to do this.	1999-01-21

I was especially touched by the father/daughter relationship.  I also liked the development of Annie and Grace's mother/daughter relationship.  The comaraderie she had with Joe was great to see and the relationship with Tom, and how it suffered towards the end, was  interesting and believable too.  The Pilgrim/Grace relationship was like a true friendship, based on trust, hurt, then slowly rebuilt.  The development of the Tom/Annie relationship was a bit unbelievable and cliche for me.  The fact that Annie was protrayed as the main character confused me a little.  But, overall I though the book was well-written and worth reading.	1998-06-10

Her description of the numerous characters in this book were consistent and believable.  That really helped to keep this going.  As always, though, I felt like I hadn't learned the whole story of any of the characters except for Aidan and Signora.  Maybe I need more of a resolution ending for characters I care about.  And, with many of Binchy's books, you just don't get all that much resolution.  I would love to read spin-offs of some of the characters in this book.  A lot of fun - great for spring.	1998-05-27

It was hard to read of the scenery in early spring.  The characters were not relatable for me and I didn't think any of them were worth rooting for, save Gwen.  I was frustrated by the victimization of a strong woman.  Seems like so many of the Oprah books have the SAME theme.  Smart woman being victimized by some man.  I want a happy ending, not a woman-getting-out-of-it -before-she-gets-killed ending.	1998-05-14

The southern imagery was entertaining and full of imagination.  I thought the characters were explored well, except I could never get a clear picture in my head of the faces of the Ya-Ya's.  More could have been done with the relationship of Sidda and her fiancee.  The fairy-tale ending was much-needed, but also a little predictable.
