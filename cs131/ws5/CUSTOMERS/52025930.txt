The content of the book is similar to O'Neill's \\"Elementary Differential Geometry\\" (e.g. covariant derivatives, shape operators), but it's easier to read. There are many undergrad texts around -- O'Neill, do Carmo, Pressley -- but this one is the most lucidly written one hands-down.     Afer going through Oprea, one might like to tackle O'Neill's \\"Elementary Differential Geometry\\" and Vols 2-4 of Spivak's \\"Comprehensive Introduction to D.G.\\"    Like O'Neill, Oprea develops surface theory using the shape operator. But Oprea takes shortcuts and doesn't develop the theory in quite the same generality as O'Neill does. For example, Oprea doesn't introduce differential forms and the exterior calculus. As a consequence, Oprea restricts himself to the Serret-Frenet equations whereas O'Neill introduces Cartan's structural equations -- of which Serret-Frenet is simply a special case -- as the method of moving frames in full generality. The structural equations are then used (by O'Neill) in both curve and surface theory.	2005-04-20

Though it was initially published over forty-five years ago, it remains relevant to understanding what is happening in the world today, as the crisis of capitalism assumes global proportions,and as capitalistic endeavor assumes ever more predatory forms. <br /> <br />The book contains a clear exegesis of classical theory: the historical development of capitalism, the increasing dominance of exchange value, the relentless pursuit of surplus-value, the inevitable development of exploitation, the various crises and contradictions of capitalism, the development of trusts and cartels, and the inexorable drive towards oligopoly,the role of the state in bolstering profits, and providing legal and social control mechanisms without which capital accumulation can't take place, and the rise of imperialism as capital seeks to expand. <br /> <br />Along with this book, one might recommend Baran and Sweezy's old classic, \\"Monopoly Capital.\\"	2005-04-18

It affords an integrated perspective of traditional high school mathematics, making explicit the intimate relationships between arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. Additionally, it indicates and suggests lines of development that are pursued in undergraduate courses. Both purposes - showing the unity of the subject, and indicating further development - are accomplished by placing traditional high school topics in a broader conceptual and historical perspective.<br />The book is divided into two parts; the first, titled \\"Algebra and Analysis with Connections to Geometry\\", deals with numbers, functions, equations, polynomials, and number systems. The second, titled \\"Geometry with Connections to Algebra and Analysis\\", deals with congurence, symmetry, similarity, area annd volume, axiomatics, and trigonometry.<br />To give some idea of coverage, the second chapter (on real and complex numbers) discusses irrational numbers, a proof of the irrationality of e, the nested intervals property of the reals, countable and uncountable sets, and the diagonal proof of the uncountability of the reals. The chapter on equations briefly discusses cubic and quartic equations and states the unsolvability of the general quintic; the names of Gauss, Ruffini and Galois are mentioned. The chapter on integers and polynomials discusses induction, recursive definitions, simple diophantine equations and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. It also indicates the analogies between the integers and the set of polynomials (both are integral domains). The chapter on number system structures discusses modular arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem, and gives examples of number fields other than the real and complex number systems (e.g. quadratic fields, and finite fields).<br />The projects at the end of each chapter extend the material covered in a  natural way, and are challenging. To give some stray examples, the coordinatisation of the Riemann sphere, the Cardano-Tartaglia method for solving cubic equations, Fermat's last theorem for n = 4, constructible numbers, and the impossibility of squaring the circle and doubling the cube.<br />The chapter bibliographies are annotated, up-to-date, and list excellent books for further study.<br />I have a few criticisms. The first is that surjective functions are not discussed, and in this connection the Schroder-Bernstein theorem does not get mentioned or proved. A second and more serious criticism is the slender coverage of analytic geometry. Only five or six pages are devoted to this. As a consequence, the authors cannot discuss the rich field of algebraic curves in particular, and algebraic geometry in general. There is also no mention of projective transformations (i.e. projective geometry) or continuous transformations (i.e. topology). Finally, there is no mention of Klein's Erlanger program.<br />These quibbles aside, the book is well-conceived and well-written. It can join Courant and Robbins' \\"What is Mathematics\\", and Stillwell's \\"Mathematics and its History\\" as a book that gives a bird's eye perspective of (part of) the discipline.<br />Professors teaching undergrad courses would want this book on their shelves; it shows some of the connections between high school material and the relatively abstract courses taught at college (e.g. Galois theory, group theory, algebraic number theory, and real and complex analysis). Undergrad students might want this book for the same reasons. High school teachers who want a bird's eye perspective of high school mathematics from a sophisticated point of view might also want a copy; suggested lines of development can be used as enrichment topics.	2003-07-14

There are also games or game fragments that didn't quite get the highest rating, but which Damsky feels are worth including. All told, there are close to one hundred games given in this third chapter.<br />Damsky has collated the notes from various sources. The cognoscenti are doubtless aware that Chess Informant itself published a book titled \\"640 Best Games 64 Golden Games\\" some years back, where the ten best games from each of the first 64 Informants were presented. Unfortunately, no notes accompanied the games. To this extent, Damsky has performed a service for the chess public. The notes explain the ideas in words, and some lines are also given, but of course, this analysis can't match that given in Informant itself, nor is it comparable to the analysis given in the recent books by Nunn and Stohl.<br />Besides performing the service of giving these \\"best games\\", with notes, in one book, Damsky also frequently indicates what it was that impressed the judges; it could, for example, be consummate technical skill, subtlety in manoevring, or brilliance in attack. We thus get an idea of what exactly it is that impresses the GM elite, i.e. how they conceive the game of chess. This will most likely have a salutary effect on the reader's chess-playing strength.<br />The cover advertises 250 games. Unfortunately, there are only 219 given altogether. About a hundred of these, given in the fourth chapter, are games readers are likely to have already seen umpteen times - games of Tarrasch, Capablanca, and Alekhine, for example; the notes to these games are sparse.

I've only worked through the analytic part. Anything by Serre is worth its weight in gold and this book is no exception; everything Serre covers is of the utmost importance. But Serre's style is extremely condensed and spare, and he makes no concessions to the reader in terms of motivation or examples. I can't digest more than half a page of Serre a day; however if one wants to understand the structure of a theory, Serre is ideal.<br />I worked through &quot;A Course in Arithmetic&quot; over a decade back. As I recall I covered Riemann's zeta function and the Prime Number Theorem, the proof of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetical progressions using group characters in the context of arithmetical functions, and some of the basic theory of modular functions. All of this material is also covered in Apostol's two books on analytic number theory (&quot;Introduction to Analytic Number Theory&quot;, and &quot;Dirichlet Series and Modular Functions in Number Theory&quot;); Apostol goes further than Serre in the analytic part -- which is only to be expected since he is devoting two whole texts to the subject.	2002-05-23

It can't be used as a text.<br />The book presents the most basic ideas pertaining to homotopy, homology, cohomology, fibre bundles, spectral sequences, and characteristic classes. The emphasis is on simple examples and simple calculations to demonstrate what is going on. Rigorous definitions, proofs, and even frequently even the statements of theorems, are avoided. <br />One good aspect of the treatment is the axiomatic presentation of homology and cohomology a la Eilenberg and Steenrod. Some of the essential material is also presented, e.g. the cup product that gives a ring structure to the cohomology group, the Kunneth theorem, the Universal Coefficient theorem, and so on.<br />The book would afford a bird's-eye view, a conspectus, to a bright undergraduate or beginning graduate student. It goes without saying, of course, that this is for motivation, and it doesn't replace the hard technical grind required to master the subject.<br />The book suffers in comparison to the one by Fomenko, Fuchs and Gutenmacher (Homotopic Topology), but that, alas, can't be had for love or money.	2002-03-05

The title, \\"Simple Chess\\", is the same as a much earlier work by Michael Stean published in 1978. Indeed Emms cites Stean's book in the introduction.<br />Chapters in Emms' book cover ideas such as outposts, the two bishops, and the isolani. Many of the examples he gives are taken from his own games.<br />The problem is that many of the ideas are covered in other books (e.g. the two bishops are covered in Watson's \\"Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy\\"; similarly, the isolated pawn is covered comprehensively in Baburin's \\"Winning Pawn Structures\\"). Nor, I feel, does Emms' book shed any new light on these ideas. The notes are all right, but nothing spectacular. <br />In contrast, Stean's \\"Simple Chess\\" is a classic and both the analysis and discussion are exemplary (It is, however, extremely hard to find this book).I can't help but feel that Emms's \\"Simple Chess\\" is but a pale imitation of Stean's earlier work.<br />Who might find Emms' book useful? Perhaps a player in the 1400-1700 category, who either needs an introduction to positional ideas or doesn't wish to read more specialised literature.	2002-03-02

Let me elaborate. The book is divided into three parts: general topology, the theory of Banach and Hilbert spaces, and Banach algebras. The first two parts lead, by way of synthesis, to the last part, where some interesting but elementary results are proved about Banach algebras in general and C*-algebras in particular. I might mention, for example, the Spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, the Stone representation theorem, and the Gelfand-Naimark theorem. <br />I can attest from personal experience that the book is well-written; indeed I worked through it chapter by chapter. But today there do exist a plethora of other treatments that can at least rival this text in lucidity, organisation and coverage. For example, for general topology, there is an excellent text by Willard titled 'General Topology',as well as Hocking and Young's old 'Topology'. Both of these go much further in the realm of point-set topology than Simmons. Similarly there are any number of well-written texts on functional analysis that cover the subject of Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces and self-adjoint operators very clearly. Indeed in some respects I feel the Simmons book was inadequate by itself and needed to be supplemented by a text on linear algebra; self-adjoint operators -- and by implication, the Spectral theorem -- need to be seen and manipulated in the finite-dimensional version before one examines their infinite-dimensional generalisation. The Simmons book is a bit weak here; one needs to be playing with matrices.<br />These are, however, minor quibbles. The book can be recommended to a junior- or senior-level undergraduate.	2002-02-20

I thought it well-crafted. Some of the things I enjoyed about the book were:<br />1) The three distinct proofs of the Sylow theorems<br />2) The chapters on linear algebra, in particular where modules over the ring of polynomials (a P.I.D.) were used to derive results on canonical forms and decomposition into cyclic subspaces; this work mimicked what had earlier been done for finitely-generated abelian groups.<br />3) The elegant discussion of Galois theory.<br />4) The final chapter on relatively deep results such as Wedderburn's theorem and the sum-of-four-squares (I think).<br />I am quoting from memory. If I looked at it again I might find more things to admire. There are lacuna, as one reviewer has noted. But in mitigation I should point out that this book is an undergraduate text, and does not aspire to compete with the books of Lang and Jacobson.<br />Given the present sorry state of American undergraduate education, it is likely that all but the strongest undergraduates will find this book a tough slog.	2002-02-20

I shudder to think that this book is being used for teacher training. There is no content. In a sense, the title belabors the obvious: who, after all, does not reflect? A physician, a car mechanic, and a refrigerator repairman all reflect on their craft, and all are problem-solvers in the context of their activity. What, then, does this book say that applies to teachers specifically? Absolutely nothing. The discussion (I use the term loosely) is couched in such broad generalities as to be meaningless. For example,take a section heading such as \\"Critical Reflection as the Illumination of Power\\" -- how can this possibly shed light on thinking? The book is replete with such hollow chapter and section titles.<br />A more fundamental objection that can be levelled against this book -- and others of its ilk -- is related to the question: what does \\"critical reflection\\" mean? The premise of the book is that the idea of \\"critical reflection\\" can exist without context in, or reference to, a specific recognised discipline (such as, for instance, history or physics). This is absurd; the craft of teaching takes place within the context of a specific discipline with its own methods and problems; teaching itself is not a discipline, no matter how much professors of education may protest otherwise. This attempt to treat the craft of teaching as a discipline (\\"education\\"), and to describe \\"critical reflection\\" within this pseudo-discipline, is the primary reason why the book lacks any substance whatsoever. There is simply nothing to talk about; \\"critical reflection\\" is a bogus notion, both in the abstract and with regard to \\"education\\"; hence the vacuous talk of \\"lenses\\", \\"autobiographies\\", and \\"critical conversations\\".<br />To provide some further elaboration of the vacuity of the notion of context-free \\"critical-thinking\\" -- and as such, intimately related to the discussion in the previous paragraph -- the problem is we cannot teach \\"critical thinking\\", because there is no such thing. There are areas of study such as mathematics and geography. Each has its own ideas, problems and epistemology. The overlap, such as may exist, belongs to philosophy -- metaphysics and epistemology, where we treat problems in the most abstract setting possible -- and hope to say something useful in the more concrete settings they emerged from. There is no \\"critical thinking\\" that applies to all, or even most, disciplines. The kind of thinking mathematics requires will be quite distinct from that which history may require. The only things we can say about thinking *in general* are superficial, misleading and platitudinous. These professional educators need a more rigorous schooling in the history and development of ideas.<br />Those training to become teachers are not (truth be told) the brightest people around. Unfortunately, drivel like this will leave them even more confounded than before.<br />The decent books on the craft of teaching remain Highet's \\"The Art of Teaching, James' \\"Talks to Teachers\\", and Barzun's \\"Begin Here\\".

The notes to each game end with a summary that encapsulates the key moments of the game and provides a verbal summary of the main themes.<br />If I could give &quot;Instructive Modern Chess Masterpieces&quot; six stars I would do so. It joins the pantheon of well-annotated game collections such as Nunn's &quot;Secrets of Grandmaster Chess&quot;, Nunn's &quot;Understanding Chess Move by Move&quot; and Timman's &quot;The Art of Chess Analysis&quot;. The quality of analysis and explanation to be found is at least equal to that found in these other books.<br />The book has been written for accomplished players. It is at least one step beyond Nunn's &quot;Understanding Chess Move by Move&quot;. Whereas the style of Nunn's book is reminiscent of a patient teacher painstakingly explaining the basics, that of Stohl is of a senior and erudite master expounding high-level ideas at a seminar for junior colleagues.<br />I particularly liked the discussion of opening theory, where Stohl entertainingly describes the evolution of ideas. A few words from him can often shed light on an entire system. The discussion of current GM understanding of openings is unparalleled and backed up by references to games that have brought about shifts in opinion and sentiment. Of course, the analysis and explanation of other phases of the games is equally outstanding.<br />As Stohl suggests, one should have not only board and pieces but also a chess-playing program and database when reading the book. His analysis should be tested. And one may have unanswered questions. GM games seldom exist in isolation; they tend to provide a snapshot of chess culture at a particular moment. The games reflect understanding of the pool of chess knowledge, which grows with the passing of time, and they make their own modest contribution to this body.

Unfortunately the abridgement doesn't capture the rich and full flavor of the original. Many of the classic examples have had to be omitted for reasons of space. A player of class C strength might learn something from this abridgement, but for stronger players I would recommend the original three volumes. It's a fact of life that the general level of chess strength and erudition has risen markedly during the last several years; the level of knowledge that once would have sufficed to maintain B strength is, alas, inadequate.<br />Many of the topics discussed in Pachman now have specialist texts addressing them. For example, for isolated pawns, see Baburin's &quot;Winning Pawn Structures&quot;; for the major pieces see Damsky's &quot;The Heavy Pieces in Action&quot;. There are numerous other examples. Pachman can be usefully employed as an introduction to these more specialised books.<br />Whether a player works with the abridgement or the original, I recommend he also have available Watson's &quot;Secrets of Modern Chess Strategy&quot;, which lends perspective on the contemporary state of understanding of strategic and positional chess.	2001-06-12

Thirty extensively annotated games are divided into three groups - opening, middlegame and endgame - depending on which phase they shed most light on. The bulk of the games - twenty-two - are devoted to middlegame themes.<br />Positional analysis and concrete tactical analysis are interwoven; often an accurate positional evaluation depends on a tactical finesse in a sub-line. In following Nunn's notes, we enter the subtle and complex mind of a modern GM. Earlier annotators writing similar books, such as Reinfeld and Chernev, would give sweeping general assessments based on superficial and static evaluations of a position and backed up by one or two unconvincing lines of play to corroborate them. Furthermore, Nunn strives for objectivity. Earlier annotators would give exclamation marks only to the winner and question marks only to the loser. Not only does Nunn point out the mistakes of the winners and the good moves of the losers but he makes clear the pyschological problems in coping with poor but tenable  positions.<br />The games are taken from contemporary GM praxis, where both players are au fait with theory past and present. The games are not one-sided contests. Note particularly the four games devoted to defence. In each case we see a full-blooded fight between evenly matched opponents. These games receive minute analysis and not superficial and facetious comments.<br />New positional methods are discussed, such as for combating the isolated d-pawn (Kamsky-Karpov 1996), where instead of playing the N to d5 in front of the isolated d-pawn, Karpov plays it to f5. Another example is playing with or against the hedgehog (Karpov-Ribli 1986). Exceptions to the classical 'rules' occur often in the games; Nunn provides the raison d'etre. The rules are seen to be half-truths at best.<br />The book will likelyappeal to players with ratings of at least 1600. Anyone who has been through such books as, say, &quot;Logical Chess&quot; and &quot;The Most Instructive Games of Chess ever Played&quot;, both by Chernev. Class B players, who all too often have blinkered vision in that they concentrate exclusively on attack, or play on one part of the board, or one tactical theme, are likely to learn quite a bit as they see how the entire board has to be kept in mind, how attack has to be balanced with defence, and also how subtle and indirect methods can often be more effective than a crude and single-minded approach.	2001-05-15
US	52025930	R1W3BPV8S5E235	0671042785	158451152	The Little Drummer Girl	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Ambiguous and Ambivalent	All of the Le Carre novels involve the theme of betrayal and exploitation in some subtle manner. This is one where the main character, as actress, has to betray and exploit herself. She - and by implication, we as readers - never know what is authentic and what is artifice in her. Le Carre demolishes the distinction. For this very quality she is taken on by the Israeli secret service, who need to construct an elaborate but plausible facade. Like all Le Carre's other novels there's an ambivalence about what is right and wrong. The characters are complex, ofttimes confusing in their motives and unsure of the efficacy and rightness of what they're doing. What makes this book unusually troubling is Le Carre's exposure of the fakeness and schism in the soul of western man.Is there anything bona fide and clear about us? Is life for us just theatre?	2001-05-03

I agree with this contention but I have to say that this book is more than a reference work. The basic methods of play are elucidated here as in no other text. Even the famous &quot;Rook Endings&quot; by Smyslov and Levenfish devotes only 47 pages to K+R+P vs. K+R. Other books just give Lucena, Philidor and some general methods of play. Anyone playing a rook ending has to constantly keep in mind the possibility of simplification to a simpler rook ending. Consequently, the material covered by Nunn serves as the building block for a rigorous study of rook endings in general. The book offers unparalleled insight and understanding. John Nunn, in the three books he has written on endings, constantly strives to translate computer results into ideas and insights palatable to the human mind. Every student of the game should have this book on his shelf.	2001-04-19

A whole range of philosophical and esoteric issues are discussed. This reviewer could only absorb the book in small doses; there was so much to mull over. It's amazing it took over 50 years for this book to be translated into English.<br />The writer does exhibit a Rosicrucian slant at places. For example, reference to the &quot;Chemical Wedding&quot;. The emphasis on the Comte de St. Germaine. At other places Szepes refers to Eastern practices, e.g. the Tibetan practice of bringing to life an inanimate statue which subsequently has to be demolished. Thus the polarity between pyschological projection and 'external' reality is re-established, which tends to become blurred when one sets out on the esoteric path and realizes that there is no distinction between psychological and physical reality. The notion of the homunculus is discussed at length. The Emerald Tablet is given in both Latin and English. The list could go on. A spell-binding book that this reviewer found edifying.	2001-03-29

The book is for non-technical people. It does introduce a number of areas of importance to security professionals, but far too superficially. The depth of coverage is admittedly deeper than a newspaper or newsmagazine piece on the subject, but it's not much deeper. The style is a bit too sensational. The organisation of the book could do with an overhaul - the author tends to drift off into examples of dubious relevance. The book in general could do with a tighter and more stream-lined organisation.<br />The book isn't devoid of merit and people wishing to learn about the area could do worse than start here.

I agree that the book should be on the shelves of mathematicians. A number of classical topics are simply not in vogue these days, and one can find them discussed at length in Struik, or in the exercises. In this sense the book certainly has a more geometric flavor than a number of contemporary texts.<br />However, Struik can't be used to understand what is happening today. For these purposes,books by O'Neill and do Carmo would be more appropriate. The discussion of manifolds and coordinate charts, the discussion of connection forms, differential forms, covariant derivatives, exterior derivatives, pullbacks and pushforwards can be found in these texts. This is the language of modern geometry.It leads on naturally to tensors, fibre bundles, de Rham cohomology and so on and so forth.The emphasis in modern geometry is on global phenomena, the interaction between local and global (e.g. Morse theory or De Rham cohomology), and the attempt to do everything in an algebraic setting (projective modules, spectral sequences, categories etc.) For this purpose, Struik is useless, though he does have some coverage of forms (he calls them by their earlier name of 'pfaffians').<br />The price of the book makes it an attractive purchase.	2000-10-20

After finishing this book I was ready for more abstract treatments of Riemannian Geometry. For example, having seen covariant derivatives on 2-surfaces embedded in R^3 motivates the abstract definition of connections on manifolds.<br /> Chapter 1 is a decent introduction to pullbacks and pushforwards of differntial forms and tangent vectors respectively. In fact, all the subsequent geometry is based on pullbacks and pushforwards.This itself motivates the more abstract definition of a differentiable manifold with its coordinate charts. True,tangent vectors are not described in the most abstract fashion (e.g. as derivations on the algebra of functions) but this is not appropriate for a first course.<br />Chapter 2 describes the language of frame field and connection forms and derives the Frenet-Serret equations in terms of moving frames and structure equations. We associate this with the methods of Elie Cartan, who used moving frames in a systematic manner.<br />Chapter 3 deals with isometries; frankly speaking I never understood the raison d'etre for such a long chapter on such a topic.<br />Chapter 4 discusses coordinate patches. Again, this is thoroughly modern, and you won't find this in Struik or Kreyszig. The idea of piecing together coordinate patches to get geometric or topological information is a twentieth-century conception.<br />Chapter 5 introduces the Shape Operator, which is subsequently used in Chapter 6 to derive the equations of surface theory. This is really moving frames again, in another guise.<br />Chapter 7 finally tries to put this in a more abstract setting by defining abstract surfaces with an intrinsically defined covariant derivative.Holonomy and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem are discussed.<br />After reading this book, one would be equipped to handle do Carmo's book on Riemannian geometry, or O'Neill's book on Semi-Riemanninan geometry, or the more recent book by Lee, again on Riemannian geometry.mannian geometry.	2000-10-17

The coverage is comprehensive, balanced and easy to digest, and all this in  the space of 144 pages.<br />Another recent book on the Sveshnikov is the one  by McDonald. McDonald has more coverage of the Bird/Larsen line while  Aagaard has more coverage of the 7.Nd5 line. In their coverage of the main  lines, however, the two books seem to be comparable in detail and  references to contemporary games. Aagaard perhaps gives more game refernces  and analysis since he save on space that would otherwise go on notes to  complete games. However some players prefer complete games to be cited (as  McDonald does) to see the course games employing a particular opening are  likely to follow. The book by Aagaard has to be used in conjunction with a  database and/or Informants. My opinion is a player should have both books,  though I slightly prefer Aagaard because of the structure and format.	2000-09-04

A  set of problems, drawn from real play, is given in each of ten chapters.  Each set is followed by detailed solutions and annotations. The problems  require ingenuity coupled with disciplined analysis. The solutions to many  are enough to elicit a startled gasp.

I'm an 1800 player, i.e. average to strong club strength. This review is directed at other club players.<br />The title of this book is a misnomer. There is a  great deal of wisdom in the 160 pages of this book. Though most club  players will know the tenets given here in one form or another, it is still  helpful to see them in one place, given clearly and illustrated with  appropriate examples. I remember that Tal used to watch chess instruction  programs on television designed for beginners. His argument was that one  can't sufficiently overlearn the basics. This is the way I feel about this  book. It is a manual of chess wisdom, as easy to read as a book of zen  aphorisms and with as much depth.<br />Sadler improves with age. I have his  earlier books on the Slav and the Semi-Slav. I recently bought his book on  the Queen's Gambit and this book of Tips. These last two are filled with  insights useful to a club player such as myself.<br />This book (Tips) has  material covering  building an opening repertoire, principles of endgame  play, the definition and role of the initiative, dynamic versus static  advantages, weak squares,building up the strength of a position,  simplifying positions to capitalise on advantages and so on. The  cognoscenti will immediately recognise these topics as non-trivial and not  elementary at all.<br /> You can't go far wrong  with that.	2000-08-11

SGC has about 120 pages more than SGP. Much of this difference is spent in narrating Nunn's  autobiographical and tournament details, which is itself quite readable.  Some extra games and snippets of games are also given. Some of the analysis  has been corrected and amplified, on the basis of flaws found by Dvoretsky  and Yusupov, and also by checking the analysis using Fritz4. The book has  been designed as a prequel to 'John Nunn's Best Games'. It is a more  professional effort than SGP. However, it has to be said that SGP has a  more pedagogic slant, and is more likely to be useful to the bumbling club  player trying to improve his play (i.e. myself). This is because of the  input of Griffiths, a worthy chess pedagogue whose every  book I've  bought.<br />But coming back to SGC. This book can be unequivocally  recommended as a top-flight book. These are the games and notes of a  strong, modern Grandmaster who plays mainline openings, and has a  preference for complex, tactical chess. Nunn has to be considered the  strongest, most professional chess writer currently around.<br />The book is  most likely to be useful to players who are rated at least 1800 or 1900.  The earlier SGP could be used with profit by players at least 1700, or  perhaps even 1600.	2000-05-22

I found the book readable because the author cites concrete examples to buttress general arguments (i.e. the Swingline operation), and also because  the author writes well (no mean feat these days).<br />I concur with his point  of view. I feel compelled to point out a couple of things to his  detractors. First of all, MacArthur never confuses 'America' with the  American political and financial establishment. It is clear that the  establishment, which spearheads the 'globalisation' movement is doing fine  out of things like NAFTA. The average American, however, is getting the  short end of the stick. Manufacturing continues to decline in the USA and  one has only to glance at the trade figures to see this. This has  consequences I don't want to belabor here. I do want to say that the new  service sector jobs are not only less skilled in general but less well-paid  and even more vulnerable to changes in the economic climate than   manufacturing. The second point is: what does it mean to say that the USA  is an economic superpower? Many of the world's largest companies have their  head offices here, true. That's about it. The outlook of these companies is  global and they have no particular sentimental attachment to any one area.  The USA is just one more colony to be commercially exploited.Perhaps the  idea of the nation state will go the way of the cheshire cat, with only the  smile left behind.	2000-05-16

Soltis can write very well - see for example 'Soviet Chess' which is a scholarly work, or see 'Confessions of a Chess Grandmaster'. The title  being reviewed here is also one of his better efforts.<br />The book explains  the pragmatic realities of calculation very well indeed. A thoughtful  reading of this book will enhance one's understanding of what to calculate,  how to calculate, how far to calculate, and what positions deserve  calculation. By implication, one's strength would improve.<br />It's difficult  to provide a synopsis of this book because, like Kotov, it's not coherently  orgainised but is a compendium of practical wisdom concerning calculation.  Chapters include 'Trees and how to build them', 'Rechecking' and 'The  Practical Calculator' - all of importance to a player.<br />I've given this  four stars (and not five) for 3 reasons. The first is lack of organisation.  The second, and more serious, is the sheer number of analytical mistakes.  The very first example (Piket - Sosonko) has an error. The sacrifice 1.Rxh7  is actually unsound. 3....Bf5, which Soltis mentions in passing, holds the  game for Black. Or examine the analysis to Ljubojevic - Stein, on page 58.  11.Qf4 works fine for White. Soltis hasn't done his spadework. The examples  that are correct are frequently so because they've been pulled, with  analysis, from other sources.This brings me to third criticism: many of the  examples are hackneyed, and frequently don't exemplify the ideas  well.<br />But these caveats aside, I can recommend this book. There is  material to ponder over here. A pity Soltis didn't give the book the time  and energy it deserved; it would have been a sterling work.	2000-05-13

The book is meant for \\"post-beginners\\" -- i.e., players who know the basics such as tactics, endgames, and a bit about openings. The book could have been titled \\"A Positional Primer.\\"    There's a trick to using the book: classify the games by theme. The (overlapping) themes I used were: rook endings, pawn endings, knight endings, bishop endings, favorable exchanges, color complex, outposts, domination, strategic attack, passed pawn, strategic attack, breakthrough, open file, endgame structure, and endgame initiative. Many of the games have more than one theme.     The games are classic: every player has to have seen Boleslavsky - Lissitzin and Smyslov - Rudakovsky as examples of outpost play. Likewise every player has to have seen Schlecter - John and Tarrasch - Showalter as examples of color complex play. And he has to have seen Capablanca - Tartakower and Tarrasch - Thorrold as examples of rook ending play.	2000-05-13

In particular, he covers attack in a way I've seen no other author do. The chapters by Keres on defending difficult positions and the art of  analysis are phenomenally good. The chapter on analysis examines minutely   half a dozen adjourned positions. I have to admit I have found errors here  and there,in sub-lines, using Fritz. What is staggering is there are so few  errors. The first adjourned position, against a player by the name of  Szapiel, takes up twenty pages. Keres brings to light the subtleties and  finesses involved in an ostensibly simple position.

The analysis is certainly not 'passionate'; a more apposite description would be 'dispassionate'. Nor is it long on variations and short on explanations. Rather, the other way  around. For 'long on variations' see the books by Speelman or Hubner.  Timman seeks to get to the heart of the position. Enough analysis is given  to explain the position. The analysis of variations is judiciously mixed  with verbal assessments and explanations. The people who would profit most  from the book would probably be of at least expert strength. Timman doesn't  belabor the obvious or give unnecessary or irrelevant lines.<br />The second  edition is a significant improvement. Criticisms given by Nunn and  Dvoretsky have been taken into account,and some of their analysis has been  incorporated, with due acknowledgement.<br />For players not quite able to  cope with Timman, another good book is Nunn and Griffiths' 'Secrets of  Grandmaster Play', which is more detailed, less terse, and written in a  more pedagogic spirit.	2000-05-09

I think both have the edge over MCO-14. Though NCO has two  hundred pages less than MCO, it provides more coverage, simply because  there's less white space. Three GMs and one FM (Burgess) have pooled their  efforts; all have have a reputation as good chess authors. The lines given  are absolutely main-line. In fact, whenever I'm learning a new opening, NCO  is my first port of call, since it gives the crucial, essential lines. The  lines have all been computer checked. I don't think MCO can compare. The  Small Encyclopedia also gives only essential lines and is not bad, but in  my humble opinion is probably not as good as NCO.<br />For those wanting  words, might I suggest Kallai's 'Basic Chess Openings' and 'More Basic  Chess Openings'?<br />The only advantage of MCO is that the abundance of white  space makes the text more readable.

Upto now I've been using Wells' 'The Complete Semi-Slav' which itself deserves accolades. However it is beginning to show its age since it  came out about five years ago. A book on the Semi-Slav by Sadler came out   3 years ago, but though not bad, it can't be called a treatise. It was  oriented towards the average club player. The book by Pedersen gives all  the latest dope on some of the most critical and fashionable lines, and  does a good job of explaining what's going on. This is no database dump.  The author has devoted a lot of thought to the lines and taken pains to  explain his thinking.<br />To give but one example, there's 23 pages devoted  to the Anti-Moscow variation: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6 5.Bg5 h6  6.Bh4 dc.

The books by Krasenkov (The Sveshnikov Sicilian) and  by Neverov and Marusenko (New Ideas in the Sveshnikov  Sicilian), though very good, were published in 1996.<br />Some of the games in  McDonald's book have been taken from Neverov and Marusenko. This is  legitimate since the games are of theoretical importance. Other games seem  to have been taken from Chess Informant. Again legitimate. The notes  McDonald provides are instructive. Quite a few of the games annotated were  played subsequent to 1996 and therefore won't be found in the earlier  books. All fine so far. But why only one chapter for the 9.Nd5 line? It  merits more than 21 pages.The coverage is a bit too sparse.

The book will give you some idea of thedevelopment of the game. Other treatments that do this are Reti's 'New Ideas in Chess' and Euwe and Nunn's 'Development of Chess Style'. 'Masters of the Chessboard' was published circa 1930 and the raison d'etre for its publication was Reti's adverse reaction to writings of one Gutenmayer. To give one example of Reti's suspect analysis take his annotation to the immortal game (Anderson - Kieseritsky,1851), published in 'New Ideas in Chess'. This has been carefully demolished in Hubner's article 'The Immortal Game' published in the American Chess Journal (No.3). 20 pages of detailed analysis reveal the truth of the game in a way broad generalizations cannot. 'Masters of the Chessboard' won't radically improve your strength if you're already over 1500 USCF. But to reiterate, it's areadable book and charts the development of some ideas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century	2000-05-04

There's Polugayevsky and Damsky's 'The Art of Defence in Chess', another by Soltis with the same title, a book by Florian titled 'Defence and Counterattack in Chess'.  There's also a chapter by Keres in 'The Art of the Middlegame' that is  outstanding. All these books have merit. This new book by Crouch is a  worthy addition and arguably the best of the lot.<br />To those familiar with  Crouch's other books, no explanation is required concerning the quality of  what he writes. His books such as 'Hastings 1895', 'Attacking Technique'  and 'Pawn Chains' are out- standing. 'How to Defend in Chess' is of a  similar high quality.<br />Twenty defensive accomplishments are extensively  and verbosely annotated. Ten games of Lasker and ten of Petrosian. These  annotations use up two hundred pages. Verbosity is important. Crouch  describes the plans and other resources available to both sides, the  practical and psychological problems, and the sheer tenacity of the  defender. The erudition displayed in these notes is impressive, with  frequent allusion being made to other annotators.<br />For those with a taste  for the game and a tastefor good writing, this book should be considered as  an essential addition to their libraries.	2000-05-04

Vaisser, in this book of his, has revealed a great deal of home analysis. This feature alone makes this book exceptional. I have used this  analysis and have reaped rich rewards.	2000-03-31

It is perhaps too sophisticated to serve as an introduction to modern differential geometry. The beginner probably needs to see examples of two dimensional surfaces  embedded in Euclidean 3-space and to do calculations with reference to such  surfaces. For example,the use of coordinate patches to cover the 2-sphere.  And then seeing how the change of coordinates in overlapping patches  affects geometric objects such as vectors, 1-forms, and the metric tensor.  This provides some grounding for the abstract treatment of manifolds and   the tensors defined on them. Also a leisurely introduction to the geometry  of curved surfaces, either classically, using the first and second  fundamental forms, or the modern way, using the shape operator (which is  equivalent). This motivates the more abstract treatment of connections,  which become necessary when there is no underlying space to embed the  surface in (Euclidean 3-space provides a notion of<br />connection (i.e.  covariant derivative) that is geometrically clear; we have to axiomatize  this notion when there's no natural space to embed in).<br />Though the book  may not be suitable as a first text, it can be used in conjunction with a  more elementary text. Alternatively, it could be used for a graduate  course. Though there are now a plethora of other good treatments around,  this book remains one of the classics,and furthermore its price makes it  particularly appealing.	2000-03-31

A number of topics are presented which other writers have glossed over. One example is the fight for piece  activity, which is a goal in itself, regardless of whether the opponent has  weaknesses or not. Another example is the use of initiative. Though the  book is thin, the density of ideas is high and there is much to ponder and  digest. I'm now waiting for his book on defensive techniques.	2000-03-31

I have found this book to be useful and indeed I have bought software based on what I've read. At the same time I have to confess I think the book could be much better. What the  author refrains from doing is critical and comparative analysis. To give  one example, ChessBase7 and Chess Assistant 5.0 could be critically  compared. To give another example, some of the shortcomings of Bookup 1.6.2  could be described. An author  such as John Nunn would have combined both  technical virtuosity and chess erudition to give a revealing analysis of  the strengths and shortcomings of the chess software currently available.	2000-03-31

Were  Rockefeller,Vanderbilt,Kennedy Sr and Gates all that honest? Honesty and  business are at odds with each other.There is constant pressure on the  businessman to cut corners,exploit workers, and misrepresent the state of  affairs to customers,suppliers and workers.This is capitalism Such a  businessman,however, may be loyal to his wife and friends.That is  plausible.<br />The writer does make the valid point that one increases the  chances of success by doing something of ones own. Becoming rich working  for others is confined to a negligible minority such as Alfred Sloan,Jack  Welch etc. But what are the chances of business success? Not made  clear.<br />Furthermore, while author does say that professional qualification  or degree don't guarantee wealth,he does need to make clear that they  enhance one's life chances,whether as an employee or business owner,other  things equal. He does make the valid point that academic work encourages  'salarytis',and that since there's at least the illusion of a career path  in front of one,reduce initiative,ambition and willingness to take  risk.Also the valid point that in today's volatile downsizing environment,  such qualifications are no guarantee of security.And finally, he does make  clear that the rigors of an academic program might inhibit the development  of other skills,knowledge and experience that may be of crucial importance  in achieving financial independence. Maths and verbal skills are but one  component.The people who are star students are all too frequently  docile,uncritical of authority,and submissive.Qualities not useful in  achieving independence.<br />Author also puts too much implicit emphasis on  money as a measure of one's worth.	2000-02-29

It should be useful for players rated anywhere from 1300 to 2300, but is probably targeted at average club players like myself, with a  rating of 1800. While there are other rook endings books on the market -  Nunn, Korchnoi, Smyslov and Levenfish, ECE - they're all rather esoteric  and removed, to varying extents, from the concerns of a practical player.  Emms gives one exactly what one needs to know. If one wants to pursue the  subject further, one can consult one of the aforementioned tomes.	2000-01-21

I must congratulate him on finishing the book in one week. More seriously, the book provides enough  coverage of commutative algebra,Galois theory and homological algebra as to  enable one to tackle the books by Eisenbud and Hartshorne on commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry respectively.There are rival treatments by  Cohn and Jacobsen but Lang beats them for conciseness.Lang is notorious for  errors and omissions in his books and so one would expect a reader to have  considerable 'maturity', i.e. the ability to correct proofs or fill in  missing details.	1999-05-20
