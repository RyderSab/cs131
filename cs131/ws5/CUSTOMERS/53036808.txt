It was written in collaboration with Kimiuo Aisek (proper spelling of his name), who was present in those parlous days, and survived to start the first dive shop in Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia (Blue Lagoon Dive Shop, now owned and operated by his son, Gradvin Aisek). It is full of descriptive information.<br /><br />Why \\"only\\" four stars? Unfortunately, Klaus Lindemann got one major item wrong - the actual name of the naval action was Operation HAILSTONE, not Hailstorm- and Mr. Lindemann chose to never set the record straight. A few of the depths seem inexact for divers, and I would not use this book as a \\"bible\\" reference for planning dives. It IS fascinating reading, and the mistakes in no way negate Mr. Lindemann's copious knowledge of the subject, nor the pioneering work he did in researching, diving and protecting the wrecks.<br /><br />This book is currently out of print, and Klaus Lindemann passed away in October, 2001 (ironically, as did Kimiuo Aisek a few months earlier). I recommend his \\"Hailstorm (sic): the Dive Guide\\" to divers, and most definitely recommend Dan E. Bailey's comprehensive book, \\"WWII Wrecks of the Truk Lagoon\\", available through Amazon. With 48 (according to Gradvin Aisek) wrecks of ships and historical aircraft, Truk Lagoon is a haven for wreck divers and WWII history buffs - one even lands at what was \\"Moen #1 Airfield\\", and if one stays at the Blue Lagoon Resort, at the Japanese seaplane base also known as \\"Moen #2 Airfield \\".<br /><br />(N.B. Sets of dive slates for the most popularly dived wrecks in Truk / Chuuk are also available - I purchased some through the MV Odyssey liveaboard when diving Chuuk most recently (Feb 2004,) and saw some other slates available at Blue Lagoon Dive Shop as well. I highly recommend these for divers heading to dive the wrecks, as well as good wreck diving training to increase your enjoyment, safely allow some of the deeper dives available and in penetrating the ships to explore holds, engine rooms, etc. safely. And, local knowledge is indispensable, as these wrecks age and deteriorate.)increase your enjoyment, safely allow some of the deeper dives available and in penetrating the ships to explore holds, engine rooms, etc. safely.

The People's Guide to Mexico continues to be THE guidebook for learning about Mexico, its people, culture and places, from an insightful author(s) who have been traveling and living in Mexico for over 30 years. A Caveat: if you are looking for a humorless, factual guide to four and five star resorts, and only like to travel first class or stay at global chain hotels, THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU. If you enjoy irreverence, humor,  colorful stories, personal experience and gaining real insight- rare in the tourist guidebook genre- about the very different, yet welcoming, culture next door, then this IS your book. (I was raised in Mexico and live in the USA, exactly opposite of Carl, Lorena et al- but I love these guys, and used to carry a battered old edition- wish I still had it!- in my VW bus when I traveled throughout Mexico and Central America in it after military service and Vietnam. I re-read it many a time, and it was my #1 book... &iexcl;Muchas gracias! Carl y amigos...)	2003-06-14

Born and raised in M&eacute;xico and having a deep appreciation of its diverse and rich folk arts traditions, and guided by the reviews, I bought this book. What others say is true- this softbound book is lavishly illustrated and is a wonderful introduction to the contemporary ceramics covered, as well as the six women potters dealt with. Thise with a love of Oaxacan ceramics will likely love this book as well.<br />There is but one, very significant problem: the title is, to me, completely misleading. The book actually covers two villages- Octol&aacute;n de Morelos, and the reigning family of potters, as well as Santa Mar&iacute;a Atzompa and two of the many potters who work there. San Bartolo Coyotepec and the creator of world-renown black pottery, Do&ntilde;a Rosa Real de Nieto, and her descendants, for example, have no coverage in this book, nor do older more traditional forms.<br />Oaxaca is an incredibly beutiful state, with many traditions and crafts. This book covers a small fraction of them- and in my opinion misleads with a title implying it covers all the ceramics of Oaxaca. With that caveat, I highly recommend (and give a restrained five stars to) this book, within the scope of its limitations.	2003-01-07

Zapotec precolumbian traditions are mentioned, and the illustrations show many steps in creating dies, yarns and weavings ranging from the traditionally inspired to the most avant garde, from natural dies to the use of anilines and naturally colored churro wools.<br />As one who has spent time learning to appreciate the arts of weaving and embroidery from weavers through Mexico and Guatemala, including a hospitable and skilled family in Teotitl&aacute;n, I heartily recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the topic covered.	2003-01-07

Stimulated by financial desperation and a challenge from a friend, he hired a silversmith from nearby Iguala and kicked off the renaissance of Mexican silverwork- initially from a table in his house, and ultimately a large workshop turning out exemplary tin, copper, weaving, furniture and, of course, silver. Almost all the smiths who carried out the Taxco tradition were trained in the Spratling workshop. <br />This eminently readable book tells the tale, though it is certainly not one of those comprehensive 600-page biographies, nor does it become overly speculative about a man who was respected and loved for his creativity and for giving impulse to a craft that made the community relatively wealthy, but also made some mistakes and enemies. (Yep, he was special, and very human!) That is, in my opinion, part of its charm.<br />This book is a bit topical, yet it manages to convey the excitement of the resurrection of a Mexican village that became an entrepot of artists, writers and would-be revolutionaries, and- for good and for bad- a huge tourist destination. It gives more than a glimmer of the many facets of Don Guillermo / Bill Spratling, a man who intended to find respite and refuge,  resuscitated a community and gave many livelihood, and largely withdrew from that same community in his last years.<br />This is written from a perspective of someone who was privileged to know Taxco, since as a youngster I hung around the talleres- especially of Hector Aguilar and the Castillo family- developing a love of Mexican silver and some rudimentary smithing skills of my own.	2003-01-07

(It is interesting to note that these authors are often quoted and cited in the newer works.) The book was written in the early '60's, just at the apogee of Taxco's productivity.<br />As a youngster, I spent many hours in Taxco, particularly in the talleres (workshops) of Hector Aguilar (Taller Borda) and the Castillo family, and have always been attracted to the diverse traditions of Mexican silver jewelry- from Michoacan, Oaxaca and elsewhere, including Taxco, which was extremely important in the renaissance of contemporary Mexican silver jewelry. The era of large talleres is largely over, with a very few still in existence. Much jewelry in Taxco today is made in tiny home workshops on contract, resulting in a decline of design and variety, not to mention the average workmanship.<br />This book is an excellent introduction, readable and intelligently written and illustrated, if limited in its scope and size due to the lack of supporting audience when it was written. I highly recommend it to those with an interest in Mexican jewelry and its traditions...	2003-01-07

(If what you need is a portable, topical and fairly complete field guide to all the critters here, get \\"An Identification Guide to the Birds, Mammals, and Reptiles of the Galpagos Islands\\" by Andy Swash et al, ISBN: 0300088647, here on Amazon instead.)<br />Unlike another reviewer, I DO recommend going to the Gal&aacute;pagos, but I also suggest doing research (Barry Boyce's guide, and others) to choose a \\"green\\" small boat trip of a week or ten days, one that assures minimum impact.<br />Politically, these unique and valuable islands are in peril right now from what has heretofore been an uncaring and corrupt government that has allowed illegal migration of people and their cirtters (one result was the 2002 oil spill off San Cristobal), untrammeled shark finning, sea cucumber gathering and commercial fishing within the boundaries of a most unique and valuable World Heritage Site and presumably legally-protected Ecuadorian National Park. Ecotourism has provided the money, concern and motivation to keep these islands preserved for research and future generations- for now. GO on this trip of a lifetime, but please tread lightly, observe and learn, support the \\"Islas Encantadas\\" from being fished out and plundered.	2002-12-29

The first time I saw this book, I viewed it with a jaundiced eye- after all, Barry is the owner-operator of a travel agency specializing in travel to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands! Glad I took the time to read it- I've bought every edition since the first!<br />Barry's book is objective, comprehensive and as up to date as a printed guide can be given that boats are launched and agencies change hands, and includes detailed information on the tour operators, their specializations (e.g. birding, diving, etc.) and even the individual boats. (This is especially valuable- there is no US Coast Guard to assure marine safety in Ecuad&oacute;rian waters, and the boat you spend a week or more on can make or break the trip- or even you, as more than one boat has sunk or burned.) The book reveals why you can not do the Gal&aacute;pagos justice with a land-based trip, nor in most cases (depending on your trip goals) with a large cruise ship.<br />You will learn when to go, how to save money to the extent possible, which operators respect the fragile island environment, which ones have university-trained naturalist-guides, which ones do a true seven day trip, vs. those who will take your money for a &quot;seven day trip&quot; and actually put you on a three day trip with a four day trip following (meaning you spend a lot of time in the same places you saw already, not to mention going to port to take on and discharge passengers.) Barry has a dry sense of humor- his slogan is &quot;&iexcl;Viva la evoluci&oacute;n!&quot;<br />As someone who has been to &quot;las Islas Encantadas&quot;, as the Gal&aacute;pagos islands is often described in Spanish, who is going again in 2003, I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating traveling there as a key planning tool. I only hope Barry is planning to update his valulable book again SOON!	2002-12-20

For you, this booklet rates three stars for clarity, comprehension level and lightness in your backpack, but it fails next to Andy Swash and Rob Still's more comprehensive and better illustrated \\"Birds, Mammals and Reptiles of the Gal&aacute;pagos Island\\".<br />For those who want a more in depth knowledge of the Gal&aacute;pagos and their wildlife, or are traveling to some of the more remote sites or the northernmost islands: you will feel short-changed and wish you had purchased more comprehensive guide(s), so you can identify all the critters you will possibly observe and learn much more about their habitats and behaviors, climate and cvlimate zones, etc. For those travelers (birders, nature buffs, divers, etc.), this booklet rates a generous three stars for its relatively topical treatments.<br />Choose your guidebooks according to your interests and skills. And go there, walk softly and leave nothing. Visiting should have as little impact as possible, and in my opinion when done properly does help protect these wonderful islands of biological diversity from rampant pirate fishing, oil spills and short-sighted political stewardship. Our \\"tangibilitized\\" interest is the only one the Ecuadorian government- at least up until now- has responded to.	2002-12-04

I'm the kind of homeowner who isn't afraid of attempting various repairs- with the proper guidance and directions (I do have some background in electronics repair, but that's a  distant relative to home repairs, IMO.) This book provides both for me through excellent organization, clear instructions highlighted by excellent overall and step-by-step photos (for instance, photos of three alternative &quot;naked&quot; shower plumbing setups as typically installed in American homes, sans drywall and covering, as well as step-by-step photos of how to perform component maintenance or replacement). Included are lists of the tools needed to do the job (ever had to stop mid-job because you didn't have the exact tool to continue?), a well-written index and even handy conversion (metric - Imperial) tables, as well as what in my opinion is the only useless bit of this book, a sketchy resource list of professional associations. I think this book still merits five stars; it is good for scoping and planning, and then to follow as you are doing. Finally- a well-illustrated and clearly written book for the rest of us, not assuming we know it all nor talking down to us! Kudos- and thanks!- to Black and Decker.	2002-12-02

Unfortunately, =this is not that book=. The layout is inconvenient, requiring one to move back and forth between a description of the animal and its photo- which often enough, turns out to be murky and not very revealing. The descriptions are brief to the point of being sketchy and forgetting some vital information, and there are some noticeable typographical errors. Though some of the information and citations are up-to-date, many are so old they verge on misinformation, and important books (Humann and DeLoach's book, for instance, are missing entirely from the non-annotated bibliography. Based on my personal experience diving with sharks and the data available during the last ten years, this book's information on sharks especially is misleading, out of date and overly alarming. Some of the island and dive site maps are crudely drawn- I have seen better drawn on white boards at dive briefings.<br />Unfortunately, this appears to be THE field-totable book available at the moment on this topic, and that's why I have it.

He is trying to keep the advice concise, yet deal with a field that is full of myths and misconceptions- and is subject to continual change, not to mention design by political expedience. But if people are concerned and not flying, or fearful and feeling in the dark, this book can help them understand what is being done about travel safety, and what each of us can do to increase self-protection while traveling.<br />Areas covered include what is being done by government, airport authorities and airlines to increase security; what individual travelers can do to reduce exposure and manage risk while traveling (or while visiting or living in a foreign location); what to do if the unthinkable happens and you are present during a hijack attempt, or taken hostage. He also attempts to address some of the current hot topics in security planning, such as whether pilots should be authorized to carry firearms.<br />Frequent travelers, those who are concerned about international travel and those who will travel to areas that carry heightened exposure to terrorism may find this book useful- but some of the tips also apply to reducing one's profile to thieves and scam artists as well, though that purpose is not overtly the topic of the book.<br />Some caveats: this book opts for succinctness, rather than lengthy explanations and references, and it deals with current air travel security practice- which could change in some of its aspects at any time. It also occasionally doles out what could be termed brutal honesty- not everyone's cup of tea, even if the probabilities are low that one will be subject to a hijack or hostage-taking situation. But as one who flies over 75,000 miles domestically and overseas every year- and who hasn't even slowed down since 9-11- I think this is a good book for those who are concerned about post-September 11 air travel, as well as those travelers who are not experienced and want to know how they can manage some of their potential risk.book for those who are concerned about post-September 11 air travel, as well as those travelers who are not experienced and want to know how they can manage some of their potential risk.	2002-05-01

As tourists, especially on package or special interest tours, people are likely to see the \\"best foot forward\\" or \\"tourist brochure view\\" of the country they visit. The dearer the travel package, the less we see- a stay at the isolated and mod-cons Sheraton - Denerau in Fiji will virtually guarantee total ingorance of the real Fiji, presenting the traveler with a Disneylandesque version of this lovely, friendly and very conflicted island nation (as indicated by the coups and disorder that continue to exist). Government tourist bureaus and travel agencies do little to dispell this view, carefully avoiding mention of the problems, conflicts, diseases and other challenges that are always there- whether in our home country or those we travel to. - Paul Theroux visits Oceania from a \\"backpacker\\" perspective, meeting people and customs at their sea level perspective. His humor is dark, his experiences are only too real (I can relate to many from my travels) and he \\"calls them as he sees them\\"- not endearing, cute or a hackneyed travelogue to sell a destination. - My perspective may occasionally be different form his, but he presents a valid and incisive perspective of Oceania and some of her people based on his encounters and observations. (For example, Fiji has some of the friendliest people, but those same people can be ethnically conflicted, can burn down a neighbor's home and try to politick for a \\"my culture first\\" constitution. And Fijian soldiers are still among the world's fiercest and bravest.) - Read this book for the off-the-tourist-path and behind-the-scenes looks at Oceania, and for some unique encounters with memorable people and customs that are really there... I still reread chapters when I want to recall more than the tourist-brochure memories of my visits in Oceania. The vivid word prictures and incisive expositions make it easy to remember, and laugh.	2001-03-07

It is also copiously and beautifully illustrated. - So, how come the very low price and my four star rating (instead of five)?

Tui De Roy has managed to capture the essence of  these wondrous islands as much as can be done photographically and make  them accessible to everyone. A wonderful gift for those who love nature, or  those who have been there.<br />For those who are going there, add Michael  Jackson's book on the natural history, Paul Humann's book on the underwater  and Barry Boyce's guide book. Tui De Roy's book will whet their appetite  and serve as a vivid reminder after the trip is over.	2000-08-31

Flasher won recognition and awards for the number of ships and total tonnage sunk. This  book documents well her patrols, her transit of mined and heavily patrolled  straits, her successful attacks on enemy shipping and unsuccessful attacks  on her by the enemy.<br />Yet, perhaps because this book was written by the  son of the sub's Executive Officer, it often reads like a series of  reports, and the people often appear as cardboard cutouts or cartoons,  missing many of the facets that would bring them alive to us. The first C O  is presented as a distant and uninvolved, if somewhat autocratic, leader, a  generally sound decision maker, if basically conservative (in submarine  tactics).<br />Additionally, the book seems a bit jingoistic- one is given the  impression this was absolutely the best submarine in the war, that perhaps  none won more awards, which is not borne out by the facts. The travails and  travels of the Flasher are of interest to war and submarine aficionados-  but when one puts this book down, one feels informed, yet  unfulfilled.<br />This book does fill in some empty spaces- but RADM Gene  Fluckey's &quot;Thunder Below&quot; was written by a Medal of Honor winner  who was there, and his personality, leadership style and heroism- and that  of the crew- shine through. &quot;Thunder&quot; is a book you put down,  think about, and go back to read again- it is alive.<br />&quot;Flasher&quot;  never managed to come alive for me- it is a well-illustrated collection of  historical and interesting data, worth reading on that basis.	2000-07-22

This certainly added  dimensionality to the book, but by itself it is arresting and filled with  stunning photographs of haunting beauty showing the island and its unique  fauna- only someone who actually lived there and loved it could create this  gorgeous book. If you enjoy the Antarctic or sub-Antarctic islands, this is  the book for you.	1998-09-15

We're divers who have visited BVI several times, and we think Jim Scheiner's bok is the best guide available for diving the islands. - Jim and his wife Odile are accomplished videographers and photographers with a shop at Baskin in the Sun's location in the Prospect Reef resort in Tortola, and they have extensive knowledge of the area- they're passing some of this knowledge on to visiting divers. - My only wish is they'd expand the book in its next edition, as there are so many interesting BVI dives sites!	1998-05-30

As a trainer of health professioanls and trainers for smoking cessation programs (Lung, Cancer and Heart Associations), I think this is a very effective self-help book for those interested in quitting smoking. It follows time-tested and proven behavioral change techniques, and has information on the newest aids, such as nicotine replacement therapy (gum and patches) and Zyban. - This book should be of particular help to those who have tried to quit previously, using only &quot;will power&quot; or &quot;gut power&quot;- which for most of us, isn't enough. It also has lots of self-work that will enable the smoker to learn the unique aspects  of his / her smoking habit, and to personalize the reasons and methods of quitting- as well as how to make the vital period after quitting lead to success, not relapse. - For the busy person or the one who has no interest in groups, this book can be a big help to make this attempt at quitting a difficult habit a lifelong success!	1998-05-30

Even today, Chile and Argentina have research bases that are political statements, and military bases (e.g. Ushuaia and Puerto Williams,) ready to unleash on each other... and the Falklands are recent history. (I visited Chile, Argentina and Antarctica this year- the three nations still have very active claims.) - The action is good, and it's refreshing to have female leads who are competent as well. I only wish Cobb had paid more attention to details... they do distract a bit, therefore only a &quot;nine&quot;. Nonetheless, I'm waiting for his next and hope it's out SOON!	1998-03-01
