If you already know a little about presentation skills:    This is the only book I've ever seen where the author claims that people pay maximum attention in the **middle** of a presentation, and least attention at the beginning and the end.    The rest of the content is of a similar quality.    2.  If you are a newcomer to presentation skills:    Based on numerous studies of such things as \\"primacy and recency\\" (what was said first, and what was said most recently), it is generally acknowledged that people tend to pay most attention at the beginning of a standard presentation, nearly as much at the end, and least in the middle.    According to this book, however, and with no hint of an explanation or supporting evidence, the exact opposite is true.    The rest of the content is of a similar quality.    It is possible, of course, that I have misunderstood the author's intended message - in which case I guess that simply demonstrates that the explanations in the book are even worse than I thought they are.	2005-09-13

For several reasons. <br /> <br />First and definitely most importantly - it regularly contradicts itself.  For example, on the subject of humor and the person who is to introduce you: <br /> <br />\\"...If it looks like they are going to read some big long thing, give them some quick funny story to say instead.\\"  Dr. Ken Blanchard <br /> <br />\\"Never give and introducer 'risky' material that requires comic timing.\\"  Tom Ogden <br /> <br />So, assuming that Mr Ogden meant \\"material which requires comic timing is 'risky',\\" we have two \\"experts telling us, one straight after the other, to (1) get the introducer to tell a funny story, and (2) avoid asking the introducer to tell a funny story! <br /> <br />This confusion is mainly down to the author's choice to use a vast collection of quotes from people she presumably regards as \\"expert speakers,\\" interspersed, from time to time, by her own thoughts and observations.  Unfortunately, despite her wealth of experience as a head of a \\"professional lecture agency,\\" or maybe because of it, Ms. Walters has produced a book that is about as superficial as most of the \\"key note\\" and \\"after dinner\\" speeches I've ever had to witness. <br /> <br />There's a mountain of material here, and SOME of it is genuinely useful, but it's all so mixed up with the dross that you'd have to be something of an expert already in order to know which bits are worth taking notice of, and which are likely to make things worse rather than better.  In which case you wouldn't need this book in the first place. <br /> <br />The second important flaw in the book is that it assumes that the \\"experts\\" actually know what makes them successful.  Which is also unfortunate, since it is widely recognised that \\"experts\\" usually have little or no idea as to what their success is really based on.  The best they can do is tell you what THEY think they do - hence the conflicting instructions and the highly variable usefulness of the book as a whole. <br /> <br />Thirdly, there is the author's own rather questionable knowledge.  In Chapter 5, for instance, there is a section on mind maps, which shows little or no understanding of the subject.  To be sure, the author does say, at one point: <br /> <br />\\"True mind map experts, which I am not, will tell you to use only one word per line along with the pictures.\\" <br /> <br />No they won't.  They'll tell you never to use a complete sentence, because if you do you will seriously undermine the main reason for using a mind map.  And that's just after they'd tell you that you do NOT have to use pictures all over a mind map, as this author asserts. <br /> <br />The obvious question is \\"Why describe a technique if you know that you don't really know what you're talking about?\\"  It may fill up some space, but it certainly doesn't do the reader any favours. <br /> <br />If you're the sort of person who gains confidence from getting \\"Reader's Digest\\"-sized quotes from a host of big name speakers then you may well enjoy this book.  If you want something with a modicum of genuine authority, from someone who writes from an in depth knowledge AND UNDERSTANDING of their subject then you'll need to look elsewhere.  <br />	2005-09-07
US	45914225	R14MSZKY3YSVXE	1899836500	572478240	7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence	Books	1	40	44	N	N	But where is the Emotional Intelligence?	Firstly, let's be very clear that this is NOT a book about Emotional Intelligence. It is a book about the authors' ideas on about NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) and how to apply NLP techniques. Whether it is about applying NLP to the subject of Emotional Intelligence depends on what definition of \\"emotional intelligence\\" is being used. <br /> <br />I have been told by one of the authors that \\"the book contains at least 25% typical emotional intelligence material\\" <br />Is it really adequate to have \\"at least 25% typical emotional intelligence material\\" in a book called \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\"? <br />And what, in this context, is meant by \\"typical\\"? <br />In my opinion it certainly is NOT, for example, \\"typical\\" EI in the sense that Daniel Goleman or Salovey and Mayer use the term. Indeed, I'd be surprised if there was as much as 6 pages of material in the entire book that corresponds to any generally accepted definition of \\"emotional intelligence\\". <br /> <br />As far as I could see, it looked as though the definition of EI used here was made up for the occasion, partly on the basis of a book by Leslie Cameron-Bandler and Michael Lebeau called \\"The Emotional Hostage\\". Indeed, \\"7 Steps\\" takes Goleman to task for not having read \\"The Emotional Hostage\\" and claims that if he had read it then he \\"might have been [sic] reached very different conclusions\\" (on page 355).  Yet strangely enough, though \\"The Emotional Hostage\\" is praised effusively, \\"7 Steps\\" also fails to reflect the key ideas in that book. <br /> <br />To be fair, these points might have been pardonable, to some extent, if the book actually added very much to our understanding of NLP, or at least showed us how to use NLP effectively in relation to our emotions. But in my opinion it does nothing of the kind. Of course that isn't so surprising since NLP itself has has always been much more interested in dealing with thoughts rather than with emotions. It is a significant gap in NLP's coverageof human psychology, and it's a great pity this book doesn't do anything at all, as far as I could see, to rectify the situation. <br /> <br />So, if you want a book on Emotional Intelligence, you'll be better off sticking with Goleman and other \\"mainstream\\" EI writers. <br />If you want an introduction to NLP then \\"Introducing NLP\\" by O'Connor and Seymour, or \\"NLP Workbook\\" by O'Connor are both far better options than this. <br /> <br />	2005-08-25

In fact, just ten minutes after finishing the book I couldn't remember a single thing that I could point to as being noteworthy in any way, shape or form. <br />  <br />The basic problem seems to be a lack of planning. <br />For instance, the first chapter is called \\"Throwing Out the Rulebook\\" which includes \\"The Seven Principles [i.e. \\"rules\\"] of Effective Communication\\". And the first rule is: \\"Forget Rules\\". <br />Ouch! That's another bullet in the jolly old foot! <br />And not surprisingly, the rest of the book includes numerous rules and lists of rules.  <br />(Maybe someone should have explained to the author that just because you call a list of rules: \\"principles\\" or \\"a guide\\" or whatever, that doesn't stop it being a list of rules.) <br />  <br />By the same token, the book seems to meander through a range of topics with no clear sense of direction, and all too often tells us \\"what\\" to do but NOT \\"how\\" to do it.  <br />On page 228, for example, we are told: <br />  <br />\\"One of the best ways to gather a little information in advance is to ask the person who invited you to the meeting. This may be someone who will be there or an assistant. Chances are they won't mind you calling to ask a few carefully thought out questions.\\" <br /> <br />Up to this point the suggestion seems extremely sensible, if somewhat obvious. But if I'm a novice at this stuff - and the book really is only beginners' level material - my big question is going to be: <br />  <br />Like what? <br /> <br />That's exactly the sort of thing the reader could really do with some advice on - but they don't get it.  After half a dozen lines of waffle on what a difference it makes whenyou can collect \\"useful information\\", the author moves off onto another topic. <br /> <br />The one thing I would agree with is that the book is written in a fairly eay-to read-style. But on the other hand, do you buy a book for its contents, or because you like the look of the packaging? <br />  <br />A very weak entry in the \\"Persuasion Skills\\" Stakes. <br />	2005-08-18

And here's why that is important:<br /><br />In 1955, when the play appeared on Broadway, the McCarthy witch hunt had collapsed in ignomany six months or more in the past, and Senator Joseph McCarthy was no longer a threat to anyone.  In 1960 McCarthy was not only out of politics - he had died approximately 3 years earlier.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />In 1950, just writing this play was a major act of bravery, because the House UnAmerican Activities Committee was operating at full throttle.  And Joseph McCarthy was one of the most powerful men in America, a man who could destroy people whole lives just by \\"suggesting\\" that they were, or had been, \\"commie sympathisers\\" - a part of the alleged \\"communist conspiracy\\".<br /><br />Is it any wonder, then, that Lawrence and Lee took the precaution of dressing up their expose of McCarthyism - the bullying, the innuendo, the bigotry, the incitement to hatred and so on - as what was by then an almost forgotten event from the 1920's, 25 years before?<br /><br />These notes are a disservice, in equal measure, because they confuse the events of the real life trial with the events in the play; and because they conceal the real motivation behind the writing of the play and the courage of the authors in daring to write the play at all *at that time*, and ignore the important messages that Lawrence and Lee wanted to get across, not only about intolerance in general, but also about McCarthyism in particular.<br /><br />If you really want a study guide for \\"Inherit the Wind\\", I'd recommend the CliffsNotes version.  It isn't perfect, but it's a whole lot better than this.	2005-07-26
US	45914225	RVARHTC1CQ51G	0789731215	529557970	Absolute Beginner's Guide to Winning Presentations	Books	2	6	6	N	N	Never Mind the Quality - Feel the Hype	<br />This is one of those books that poses more questions than it answers.  The biggest question being: <br /> <br />Whoever decided this book was appropriate for \\"absolute beginners\\"? <br /> <br />Because that's one of the things it certainly isn't. <br />Seeing that this is just one book in a series - like \\"XXX For Dummies\\" - I suspect that the title has far more to do with giving the book a uniform appearance than with the contents. <br /> <br />Second question - did the big name half of the writing team that produced this book (that's Jerry Weissman) bother to read the finished manuscript?  The reason I ask is that the hype at the front of the book (page xi - which has the wrong page header, by the way) claims that: <br /> <br />\\"Jerry Weissman is the world's number-one corporate presentations coach\\" <br /> <br />Yet several of the anecdotes in the body of the book suggest that his \\"coachees\\" forget everything he has supposedly taught them and have to call him in again when they want to do another presentation.  Good for business, perhaps, but I wasn't exactly reassured about the quality of the teaching I was likely to get from this book.  And sad to say, I my expectations were fully met. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the third question - why was it necessary to strew the text with stories about Mr Weissman and this or that big-name company board member?  Are we supposed to be so dazzled by this array of senior business people that we overlook the quality of the teaching?  A little blowing of one's own trumpet is fair enough, but the seemingly continuous name-dropping in this book is so far \\"over the top\\" that it goes from being 'incredible' to being 'uncredible' - in this reviewer's opinion - long before the book is even halfway through. <br /> <br />Which raises the next question - why is the book so long? <br />In fact the main text is just over 200 pages long, but for many of those pages the text consists of far too much waffle and far too little information. <br />Now this is not to say that the book doesn't contain \\"any\\" accurate or useful information.  It does, but nothing like enough to warrent reading through the acres of waffle that constitutes a majority of the text. <br />Which is why I suggest the book is in no way suitable for \\"absolute beginners.\\" <br /> <br />It seems to me that if you are just getting started as a presenter then you want something as succinct as possible, which covers all the basic points you need to know as briefly as possible so you can get on with actually putting the information to work.  What you get here is the opportunity wade through pages of \\"what I told The Chairman of the Board at Mega Corp. in nineteen hundred and frozen stiff,\\" and a few useful guidelines. <br /> <br />If you enjoy reading about someone else's experiences - and you have the time for such luxuries - then you might enjoy this book.  If you want a genuine \\"nut and bolts of presenting skills\\"-type book then I'd recommend \\"Successful Presentation Skills\\" by Andrew Bradbury.  It has to be one of the best, and most comprehensive, books on the subject that I ever bought.	2005-07-07

Because this book is one big letdown. <br /> <br />The contents of the book follow the usual reprint pattern, more or less, consisting of a number of focused chapters by several different authors.  The exception to the rule, in this instance, is that one author in particular (who also edited the book?) features several times. <br /> <br />Not that it makes much difference who wrote what, because the entire contents are uniformly mediocre. <br />Firstly there's far too much \\"what\\" you should do, and far too little \\"how\\" to do it. <br />Secondly, there doesn't seem to have been any attempt at all to deal with the frequent, and wholly unnecessary repetition - or sometimes contradiction - in the information on offer. <br />Thirdly there seems to be considerable confusion as to what is meant by the word \\"presentation\\".  Thus more than one author pigeonholes their comments under sales, speeches, etc., instead of giving guidance that is useful in ANY presentation.  Which wouldn't be so bad if only these \\"tips\\" weren't presented at such a high level that they are almost entirely devoid of useful detail. <br /> <br />The fact is that anyone with a passing knowledge of the presentations business - but without any practical experience - could have written this book.  And quite likely made a better job of it. <br />Indeed, I have a book on \\"Successful Presentation Skills\\" (ISBN 0-7494-3259-4) which I got 2-3 years ago, which covers everything in the Harvard book, and quite a lot more, without the pointless repetitions.  It also gives far more practical advice - both \\"how\\" to do things, and \\"why\\".  For example, instead of merely naming different types of presentations, it identifies the five most frequent reasons for giving a presentation, and defines a basic layout for each. <br />Despite that, it's written by just one person.  And it's cheaper! <br /> <br/>Not very difficult to decide which book to go for, IMO. <br />	2005-05-27

Naturally Iris gets to know some of the inhabitants, such as businessman Philippe Bonard. So when Bonard opens a rural study centre, Iris agrees to run a painting course for him, and invites Melissa to go along. <br />Melissa accepts the invitation, meaning to use the time to get stuck in to her latest \\"Nathan Latimer\\" novel (as author, not reader), but fate intervenes, and the two women have hardly had time to unpack before a dead body is discovered. <br /> <br />This is one of those stories where few of the characters are quite what they seem, and some are very different indeed. The story is well-plotted, and though it might have been useful to have had an explanation of exactly who the Camisards were (as a brief appendix, perhaps?), the lack of information on this point doesn't really hamper the main story line. <br /> <br />I got the impression that Ms Rowlands knows the Cevennes region from firsthand experience. and if that isn't so then she's an even better writer than I thought.  I also suspect that Inspector Hassan is based on a real person - at least, I hope he is. <br />Either way, taking Melissa off into a completely foreign setting, with a mixture of nationalities in the supporting cast, is an interestingmove, which works well. <br /> <br />Another first class Melissa Craig mystery. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-04-27

Apart from that they are very distinct characters, and enjoyably so. <br /> <br />And now back to this book: <br /> <br />Betty Rowlands really has her Melissa Craig character down to a \\"t\\" - civilised, yet quite capable of being both brash and rash; intelligent without being unrealistic or overwhelming; and above all, consistent and therefore believable. <br />This is the fourth book in the series, and is possibly a little more restrain than its predecessors. Nevertheless, it moves along at a good pace that keeps the reader's attention, and there are enough clues spread through the book to make the ending entirely credible. <br /> <br />If there was anything about the book I'd change I think I'd like to have seen a little more of Charlotte and Penelope - and possibly a little less of Mitch. Chris, on the other hand is given just the right amount of space to make him interesting, and amusing, without getting in the way of the plot. <br /> <br />In other words, a very well-crafted story which keeps to the high standard of the previous novels in the series (and not a ball of wool in sight!). <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-04-27

Her solution is a small cootage outside a small Gloucester village - where her next door neighbour promptly discovers a dead body in the woods just across the small valley. <br /> <br />Aubrey is a complete pain, and one has to wonder how someone with as much going for her as Melissa could ever have got caught up with such a useless lummox. Jack is now at the far end of a phone, and London is soon a distant memory. But there is that murder, and Melissa (creator of ace Scotland Yard detective, Nathan Latimer) soon finds herself helping a young local reporter to carry out an unofficial investigation - which ends in success, though only after it narrowly misses being a complete disaster. <br /> <br />This is a terrific first novel in the Melissa Craig series, and it is a complete mystery to me that the earlier books are now, in many cases, so hard to come by. Maybe the publishers should relaunch the entire series so far to give them a fresh start? <br /> <br />I'm now on my fifth book in the series, and they have all been of a consistently high standard so far - if you like that sort of thing. My only quibble about this particular book is that after having developed such an ingenious plot, Ms Rowlands delivers the solution somewhat like a thunderbolt out of a clear blue sky. <br /> <br />NEVERTHELESS for all those readers who appreciate British country village-type mysteries this gets five stars without any problems at all. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-27

How on earth did the authors manage to make writing the book last a whole six years?    Why, after taking all that time and trouble, did they make the final punch-line so obvious?    And most of all. why on earth did they bother to write the book at all, other than - possibly - to cash in on the success of books like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"?    Although the writing style is fairly competent, the main features of a good novel - plotting, characterisation, etc. - are very much novice standard.  In fact there is, quite frankly, absolutely nothing to justify spinning out this slender storyline to just over 500 pages, most of which is actually a rather mundane blow-by-blow account of being an undergraduate student at Princeton, plus the on/off love affair between the narrator and a first year student.    There is, to be sure, a sort of backstory that intrudes into the present day, but the protagonists are, like everyone else in the book, so 2 dimensional that it is hard to give a tuppenny damn about what happens to any of them - even when the killer is finally unmasked and meets a dramatic end.  Considering that one character in the backstory is the narrator's own father that's quite an achievement.    The book that supposedly provides the cental mystery, and the driving force behind the whole story - the \\"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\\" - is severely underused, IMO, and simply gives the authors a chance to parade some obscure knowledge about Renaissance Florence, whenever there is a lull in the love story.  Here, too, it is impossible to understand the \\"Hypnerotomachia\\"'s supposed ability to cause an all-consuming obsession in those who read it.    My one and only thought, as I read the last line of \\"The Rule of Four\\", was \\"Why didn't someone warn me what a waste of time it was?\\" (I only looked at the UK reviews, my mistake!)  So here's the warning for you that I never had.	2005-03-07

Indeed, at one point in the book the authors claim that all meta programs (\\"metaprograms\\", as they call them) work along a sliding scale.  Which clearly is NOT true of meta programs such as the \\"Work Preference Filter\\", the \\"Primary Interest Filter\\", and especially not in the case of the \\"In Time/Through Time\\" or \\"Time Storage Filter\\" meta program, which the authors confuse with \\"Time Lines\\" as in Time Line Therapy. <br /> <br />Worst of all, there doesn't seem to have been any attempt to edit the book once it was complete.  Thus, for example, there are several places where a topic flagged up as being covered \\"later in this chapter\\" actually turns up on the very next page.  Likewise the text itself is inconsistent, as in: <br /> <br />\\"We get very good at one style of thinking and processing information and let the rest of our senses lie dormant in a rusty heap.\\" <br /> <br />Not only is this not true, psychologically speaking, but the authors flatly contradict themselves less than three pages later: <br /> <br />\\"As human beings we naturally blend a rich and heady mix of these three main dimensions, yet we tend to have a preference for one mode over the others.\\" <br /> <br />So, \\"rusty heap\\" or \\"rich and heady mix\\"? <br />If you know enough to recognise which description is more accurate then you already know far more about NLP than this book will tell you.  And if you don't know enough to weed out the nonsense, I'm afraid you're likely to end up with a pretty confused view of the subject if you read this book. <br /> <br />Definitely one of the worst books on NLP I've read. <br />	2004-11-24

Having seen the previous reviews, I came to this book with high hopes. They were never realised. Obviously the author has hit the nail squarely on the head for some readers, but I'll be hornswoggled if I can tell why.<br />When I got to the end of the book I was still waiting for something, anything, that would turn my dissatisfaction into a feeling that it had all been worthwhile. But my hopes simply weren't met.<br />OK. Do you see a pattern in those first two paragraphs? Lots of promise but no delivery, nothing to get your teeth into. That is how this book was *for me*.<br />The book starts well.<BR>Chapter 1: The Six Stories You Need to Know How to Tell. Great stuff - for the first 26 pages, But somehow that seems to be the nearest we come to anything concrete regarding the art of storytelling. It is followed by over 200 pages of text, but those 200+ pages concentrate almost entirely on &quot;what&quot; you should do, with far too little on &quot;how&quot; to do it.<br />Things weren't helped by the story at the start of Chapter 6: Sound Bite or Epic. I was already halfway through the book, and still wondering when we were going to get to the meat and potatoes, and the &quot;Somali tale from Ethiopia&quot; about a woman going to a shaman who tells her to get hold of a tiger's whisker, really pulled the plug.<BR>Firstly Somalia (where Somali's come from) and Ethiopia are two separate countries, next-door neighbours, who spend much of the time at each other's throats. Secondly don't Africans have witch doctors, etc. rather than shamans?  and thirdly, there are no tigers in Africa, only lions (tigers are found on the Indian subcontinent).<br />Now you might think this is nit picking, especially since the story itself does illustrate a valid point.<BR>My problem is that this kind of presentation strikes me as being thoroughly disrespectful. It confuses Somalia and Ethiopia, it lumps all &quot;wise men&quot; under the trendy label &quot;shaman&quot;, and it shows a basic ignorance of nature. In short, *to me* it says: &quot;I'm telling a story, I don't have to go to the bother of actually getting the factual bits right - not even in the attribution.&quot;<br />Fine, but if an author wants me to pay them for what they're offering then I believe they DO owe their readers sufficient respect to avoid making such basic errors.<br />My biggest concern, however, is that the book simply doesn't &quot;walk its talk&quot;.<BR>If storytelling - or just &quot;story&quot;, as the author whimsically insists on calling it throughout most of the book - is supposed to be so effective, shouldn't the book actually *illustrate* this fact rather than just telling me about it?<BR>Why, for example, are a number of the stories included in the book presented in cut down form instead of allowing the reader to savour - and learn from - the full length version?<br />This author apparently runs workshops on various aspects of storytelling, and for all I know these may be incredibly stimulating and effective. Unfortunately, I found no such excitement in this book, just the same few messages - &quot;storytelling is wonderful&quot;, &quot;storytelling builds bridges&quot;, etc. - repeated over and over and OVER again.<br />For my money, just about ANY book by Idries Shah will give more insight into storytelling than &quot;The Story Factor&quot; - even the books that (apparently) contain nothing but stories.	2004-06-30
US	45914225	R3BPGZUXPSXO9N	0684836599	66659027	The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life	Books	2	75	99	N	N	Oh What a Clunker!	This book is so badly written that many readers, including those who are college graduates and used to reading academic texts, don't seem to know what it actually says.  Let me give a simple example:<br />I have recently read two books, one by a researcher into REM sleep and one by a General Practitioner, who both cite &quot;The Emotional Brain&quot; in support of their comments on the &quot;limbic system&quot;.  One of the previous reviewers on this page does the same.  And all three of them talk about the limbic system as being the source of our emotions.<br />But check out what LeDoux himself has to say on the subject:<br />&quot;Either the limbic system exists or it does not.  Since there are no independent criteria for telling us where it is, I have to say it does not exist.&quot; (page 101)<br />And later, on the same page:<br />&quot;The limbic system term, even when used in a shorthand structural sense, is imprecise and has unwarranted functional (emotional) implications.  It should be discarded.&quot;<br />This deconstruction of the &quot;limbic system&quot; myth actually takes up several pages, so how come people so obviously misrepresent LeDoux's view?<br />To be blunt, this book is vastly oversize and underpowered.<br />Most of the first half of the book is dedicated to trying to steamroller the reader into accepting the notion that the human brain is simply an evolutionary advance over the brains of &quot;lesser&quot; creatures.  But not because the book has anything useful to say about evolution.  In fact it several times falls into the trap of talking about evolution as though it were a teleological process, as in:<br />&quot;... a few choices that evolution has had the wisdom to connect up ...&quot; (page 69)<br />Evolution has had &quot;the wisdom&quot; - oops!  I don't think so.<br />No, the reason behind the propaganda is that LeDoux's research has been mainly conducted on rats, and most of the other research he cites has been done on other non-human creatures, from flies to dolphins.  The amount of research carried out on real live humans has been hardly enough to fill a tin cup.  Hence the need to try to convince us that, because we are evolutionarily linked to the real test subjects in this book, what's true for them is *probably* true for us humans, too.<br />So, as late as the end of Chapter 6, we find this comment:<br />&quot;We clearly need to go beyond evolution in order to understand emotion, but we should get past it by understanding its contribution rather than ignoring it.  I think we have now done that, at least for the emotion of fear...&quot; (page 178)<br />178 pages, of a 303 page book, just to demonstrate the role of evolution?  And even then the text hardly rises above the ultra-trivial &quot;explanation&quot;:<br />However things are, they are that way because they conferred the greatest advantage in the struggle for survival.<br />Gee, willikers.  How's THAT for 178 pages of rocket science!<br />Worse still, this EC (evolutionary correctness) approach actually undermines the usefulness of the book.  In the first place because it imposes the questionable assumption that ALL emotions are intended to arouse us:<br />\\"When we are in the throes of emotion, it is because something important, perhaps life threatening, is occurring ...\\"  (page 300)<br />Oh well, bang go \\"satisfaction&quot; and &quot;sadness&quot; as emotions!<BR>Secondly because it reduces sections of the book to pure nonsense.  For example:<br />&quot;It's hard to believe that after all these years we actually still don't have a clear and definitive understanding of the role of body states in emotions.&quot; (page 295)<br />Got that?  NO, repeat NO clear and definitive understanding.  But move ahead just one sentence and we read:<br />&quot;Emotional systems evolved as ways of matching bodily responses with the demands being made by the environment...&quot;<br />Oh, so we do know after all?<BR>No - this is yet ANOTHER of LeDoux's GUESSES.  Because when it comes right down to it, if you read this book carefully and critically you are going to notice that's really what it's all about - some research massively padded about with guesses.<br />At the beginning of the book, around the time that he's demolishing the notion of the limbic system, LeDoux tells us that he will demonstrate how the amygdala and associated brain functions control the emotion of fear, and how this ties up with the rest of the emotions.  He thinks!<br />Well, we get a fair amount of information about the amygdala - though hardly conclusive.  This is tied to other emotions, which LeDoux *suggests* have their own functionality, not necessarily involving the amygdala, by the simple process of fudging.  From page 282 onwards the functionality of fear is simply spoken about as though it were an all-purpose description of how emotions are generated, typified by a list of &quot;bare essentials&quot; which are described as &quot;what's dispensable and indispensable for the emotion fear.&quot;  It starts off with three elements that relate to fear, but ends with three totally non-specific elements (pages 296-299).<br />So having started out by saying that different emotions use different functionality, we end up with fear and ???????<br />And there's more.<BR>Remember the first half of the book was designed to prove how similar humans and non-humans were?  Well, on almost the very last page of the book that all gets blown out of the water when we are told that the human brain is significantly different from all others because, \\"natural language only exists in the human brain [and] in human the presence of natural language alters the brain significantly. ... Whatever consciousness exists outside of humans is likely to be very different from the kind of consciousness that we have. ... Human consciousness is the way it is because of the way our brain is.  Other animals may also be conscious in their own special way due to the way their brains are.\\" (pages 301 and 302)<br />Ah, well.  Back to the drawing board!	2004-06-29

It is, in fact, pure speculation based on nothing resembling valid evidence.<br />The purpose of the book seems to be that the &quot;Holy Blood&quot; - the bloodline of the descendents of Jesus Christ - began with the marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene - the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; - at Cana, and the subsequent birth of their child.<br />Quite obviously, then, the whole book depends on the production of some kind of proof that Jesus and Mary were indeed the bridegroom and bride at the marriage at Cana where Jesus is said to have turned water into high quality wine.<BR>Without the marriage and the child nothing else in the book amounts to the proverbial &quot;hill of beans&quot;.<br />So, does the book make a good case for this central claim?<br />No.<BR>In fact all it offers is page after page of &quot;if&quot; this, &quot;if&quot; that and &quot;if&quot; the other.  And that isn't the worst of it.  A little careful reading shows that the authors aren't even sure what the marriage at Cana was about.  So, at one point they write:<br />&quot;From the account in the Fourth Gospel, the wedding at Cana would seem to be a modest local ceremony - a typical village wedding...&quot; (page 348).<br />Got that?  The marriage at Cana was &quot;modest&quot;, &quot;local&quot;, a &quot;village wedding&quot;.<BR>Okay, let's move forward just 16 (sixteen) pages and see what the book says about that same event:<br />&quot;And the wedding at Cana would seem to bear further witness to Jesus's status and social position.<BR>&quot;This wedding does not appear to have been a modest, humble festival conducted by the 'common people.'  On the contrary it bears all the marks of an extravagant aristocratic union, a 'high society' affair attended by at least several hundred guests...<BR>&quot;All things considered, the wedding at Cana would seem to have been a sumptuous ceremony of the gentry or aristocracy.&quot;  (page 364)<br />Well, I'm not sure how anyone can come to two such diametrically opposed descriptions of a single event and claim that they are indeed both describing the SAME event.<BR>How does a &quot;modest local ceremony - a typical village wedding&quot; manage to also be &quot;an extravagant aristocratic union&quot;, &quot;a sumptuous ceremony of the gentry or aristocracy&quot; and &quot;a 'high society' affair attended by at least several hundred guests&quot;?<br />What is patently obvious is that in a rational world these two accounts definitely DO NOT describe the same event.<BR>And if the book can contradict itself in such an extreme fashion over something as simple as a wedding feast, what possible faith can one have in anything else it says?<br />The book is indeed about an illusion, it is most definitely based on nonsense, and it certainly looks as though it assumes that its readers will register off the scale for gullibility.<br />An insulting and unsavoury book of no discernible merit whatsoever - not even as trash fiction.	2004-04-06

The proverbial iron fist inside the velvet glove.<br />It took only a little while longer to realise that the book is NOT about emotional intelligence, either in practice or as the title of a specific branch of psychology, as described by Mayer and Salovey, Goleman, Bar-On, et al.<br />But it was only when I got about halfway through the book that I realised just where it was coming from.<BR>I quote from a section ironically headed &quot;Standing Firm&quot;:<br />' &quot;I was at a dinner party the other day when an elderly man started making racial jokes,&quot; says Gene.  &quot;A few months ago I would have thought that I had two choices: Do something about it or like it.  But this time I realized a third choice was right in this particular case: dislike the behaviour without making a stink over it.  I didn't *have* to try to change the man, and I didn't have to worry about how my inaction looked to anyone.&quot; '<BR>(page 116)<br />So does the book point out that &quot;Gene&quot; had the option to speak out/&quot;stand firm&quot; against racism without having to go to the extreme of &quot;making a stink&quot;?  Does it explain that we can openly and thoughtfully express disagreement over anti-social &quot;behaviour&quot; without having to play psychiatrist with the person concerned?<BR>In fact does it give any guidance at all on how to constructively deal with a touchy situation like the one Gene encountered?<br />You might expect so, in a book that ALLEGEDLY teaches people how to develop emotional intelligence.  But you'd be wrong.  On the contrary, all we get is support for Gene's inaction:<br />&quot;When a decision *feels* right, it *is* right.  Don't think you have to justify it.&quot;<BR>(page 116, emphasis as in the book)<br />Well, here's a couple of quotes from people who had a somewhat different point of view:<br />&quot;It is necessaryonly for the good man to do nothing for evil to triumph.&quot;<BR>Edmund Burke (1729-1797)<br />&quot;He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it.&quot;<BR>Martin Luther King (1929-1968)<br />I guess it depends on whether you agree with &quot;Gene&quot; or with Edmund Burke and Martin Luther King, as to whether you choose the kind of ersatz &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; on offer in this book.	2004-02-29

Mind you, we're also told that 3.3% of 1,500 is 51 (it's actually 49.5, but who's counting), so I assume somebody was working with a broken calculator.<br />Likewise poor old Mehrabian gets trotted out, and as usual in these books, there's not a hint that Mehrabian's 7-38-55 stats ONLY apply to (a) non-factual messages, where (b) there is some inconsistency between the messages transmitted in the words, the vocal signals and the facial expressions/body language.<br />And once again we're regaled with the Stanford University \\"Marshmallow Test\\" - and once again we AREN'T told the real significance of the test, namely WHY it proved such a good predictor of future performance. Ah, well (big sigh).<br />Is this \\"nit picking\\"?  I don't think so.<BR>If an author can't get his ducks in a row on the simple things, what's the chances that the more complex sections are worth a row of beans [to thoroughly mix a metaphor :) ]?<br />Which brings me to my major criticism - that the book as a whole isn't really about emotional intelligence, though it does touch on emotions from time to time.<BR>There is a short section in Chapter One, for example, which sort of answers the question \\"What is Emotional Intelligence\\".  It claims to describe Salovey & Mayer's version, Reuven Bar-On's version, and Daniel Goleman's version.  I'm not familiar with Bar-On's work, but the summary of Goleman's work is brief to the point of inaccuracy.<br />But who cares, fromChapter Two onwards all we get is a highly eclectic, rambling discussion of all sorts of cognitive (thinking) activities that might or might not be related to coaching, and certainly have very little to do with EI.<br />Another lemon tinted clunker.	2004-02-09
US	45914225	R37LTLBE09AVQL	1879181037	228962299	The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail	Books	1	30	51	N	N	A Very Silly Book	This is just another of those very silly \\"IF books\\" from the fantasy tradition that can be traced back to books like \\"Chariots of the Gods\\", \\"The Bermuda Triangle\\", etc.    The \\"IF\\" method of turning fiction into alleged fact is based on the fallacious version of the three step logical argument know as a \\"syllogism\\" pioneered by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle.    A correctly constructed a syllogism might look like this:    All men are mortal  All mortals die  Therefore all men die    An incorrectly constructed syllogism would look more like this:    All men die  All grass dies  Therefore all men are grass    \\"IF books\\" usually take the restructuring process one step further using the formula:    1. IF A is true    2. And if B is true    3. Then C must be true    4. Therefore D is true.    In \\"IF books\\", the statements in Steps 1 and 2 are almost always true.  The \\"sleight of hand\\" comes as we move on to Step 3 in the process, which is nothing more than an unsupported extrapolation from Steps 1 and 2.  And since the veracity of the statement in Step 4 depends on Step 3, there is actually no reason to suppose that either of the last two statements is true, even though it LOOKS as though they were arrived at by the use of logic.    For example, Ms Starbird cites Jesus' instruction to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection, in John's gospel, when Jesus tells Mary not to touch Him.  According to Ms Starbird, what Jesus really meant was \\"do not cling to me.\\"  On the basis of this unsupported reasoning she then goes on to claim that this proves they were married.    In other words, by means of the distorted syllogism ploy:    1.  If John's gospel says that there was a meeting in the cemetary between Jesus and Mary (true)     2.  And if it says that Jesus commanded Mary not to try to \\"touch\\" him (true)    3.  Then Jesus \\"must\\" really have meant \\"don't cling to me\\" (no supporting evidence)    4.  Therefore Jesus and Mary \\"must\\" have been married (pure speculation which LOOKS as though it follows logically from statements 1 and 2, but which ACTUALLY relies entirely on the unsupported ALLEGATION in step 3).    The tenuous basis for this line of argument is that the original Greek phrase has three meanings: \\"To touch\\", \\"To hold on\\", \\"To embrace\\".  Ms Starbird presumably supposes that the correct translation of the phrase in this passage is \\"embrace\\" - but on what basis?    There are four different Greek phrases meaning \\"touch\\" which are used in the New Testament - and three of them are used only once.  This most common phrase is used 36 times, including passages such as:    \\"touched the hem of his garment\\"  \\"If I may just touch his clothes\\"  \\"he came and touched the coffin\\" and  \\"he touched his ear and healed him.\\"    Does it really make sense to translate these passages using Ms Starbird's translation, which would give the readings:    \\"clung to the hem of his garment\\"?  \\"If I may just cling to his clothes\\"?  \\"he came and clung to the coffin\\"? or  \\"he clung to his ear and healed him.\\"?    As a matter of fact, out of these 36 passages, these is only ONE example of the phrase being used in a way that clearly refers to the intimate way a husband and wife would touch each other.  Looks like pretty flimsy \\"evidence\\" to me.    As to the claim that Ms Starbird is a \\"pre-eminent theologian\\", when an American TV show ran an item on Ms Starbird's claims and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (which deals with the same theme), Professor Darrell Bock, who teaches New Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary, totally rebuffed the idea that Jesus and Mary were married, saying that Mary Magdalene's move to touch Jesus was nothing more sensational than \\"her single act of devotion, given to him without concern about what people are thinking about what she's doing.\\"  The show's presenter admitted that the majority of biblical scholars consulted for the program agreed with Professor Bock's assessment.    So, if you're not to worried about the use of illogical \\"logic\\", and you prefer to have your Bible stories sexed up and sensationalised, this may well be the book for you.    If, on the other hand, you prefer at least a modicum of intellectual rigor, you'll likely find a whole host of books far more worthy of your attention.	2004-01-29

The style of the writing is hopelessly scholarly and pedestrian.  In its time, no doubt this help to justify the book's claim to be academically respectable.  Today it just makes it a very heavy-going read.<br />2.  Campbell himself attaches terrific importance to the validity of Freud and Jung's work when he seeks to explain the elements of \\"The Hero's Journey\\".  And since the credibility of Freudianism in particular has been seriously undermined over the last 50 years, that inevitably consigns Campbell's work to the outer fringes of valid interpretation of the material he covers.<br />As interesting as the basic material is, the dry-as-dust style of writing robbed it of most of its sparkle, as far as I was concerned.  The highly questionable interpretive/psychoanalytical sections further interrupted the flow - whilst adding nothing of any value.<br />If I'd known then what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered with this book.<BR>I reckon you'd learn just as much about the basic process of The Hero's Journey by watching all three \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films.

Especially when the book was first printed 8 years ago - plenty of time, you might think, to spot and correct such an obvious error in future printings.<br />But apparently neither the author nor the publisher did spot the mistake.

It may be a company car, or a friend's car.<BR>Secondly, they may be such an effective negotiator in business and earn so much that they just don't care what their car costs as long as they get what they want, NOW!<BR>Thirdly, it might have been a present.<BR>Fourthly, they may have bought it secondhand.<BR>And so on.<br />To tell us that the car someone owns can define their negotiating skills ABSOLUTELY is patently nonsense.<br />The third error, identified by the author himself, starts on page 260 when he opens a discussion of the NLP eye accessing cues model.<BR>In an online article the author now *claims* that the eye accessing model is not accurate and that he has carried out experiments (back in the late 1990's) to prove it.<BR>Leaving aside the fact that there is also a website which demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt the amateurish nature of these experiments, if the author claims to *know* that the eye accessing cues model isn't accurate, why is it still in the book three printings after the author's experiments?<br />This looks to me like nothing more than a collection of bits and pieces of information culled from various other sources (including Cialdini?), with no particular skill or understanding.<BR>Typical example: on page 104 (last paragraph) we read &quot;Strategic movement was one of the best kept secrets in communication, until you read about it in this book!&quot;<br />Well, not exactly.  In NLP circles this technique is known as &quot;anchoring the room&quot; and in my experience has been reasonably common knowledge since *at least* 2-3 years before this book was first published.<br />I'd strongly recommend Cialdini's book, even if you've already bought this book.<BR>You'll be amazed at how much extra information there is in &quot;the real thing&quot;.	2003-11-21

What we DON'T find out is what has really shaped the contents of the book, and this despite the fact that there is solid evidence that in numerous instances the views and claims are based on indirectly obtained, and often wildly off beam, information rather than on solid investigation.<BR>In short, we are offered prejudices posing as objectivity.<br />Take the rejection of &quot;the unconscious mind&quot;, for example.<BR>The book provides a lengthy, even tedious, pseudo-scientific discussion of how &quot;science&quot; has failed to demonstrate the existence of the &quot;unconscious&quot; mind as described by Freud, Jung and Tart, and then leaps to the unsupported conclusion that therefore there is no such thing as the unconscious mind.  <br />In the first place this argument presupposes that nothing is &quot;true&quot; until it has been scientifically validated.  Which is a bit like arguing that Australia dind't exist until the first white explorers discovered it.<BR>Secondly, it studiously ignores the fact that &quot;scientific&quot; knowledge is itself a highly moveable feast - what seemed to be proven/disproven yesterday may well turn out to be disproven/proven tomorrow.  (Yesterday &quot;natural selection&quot; was seen as THE controlling force behind evolution, today it is just one part of a much larger, more complex picture, tomorrow - who knows.)<br />But then again, you really don't need to be a rocket scientist to recognise the validity of the notion of an &quot;unconscious&quot;, or &quot;out of conscious&quot; mind.<br />Fact: numerous experiments carried by Prof. Robert &quot;Pygmalion in the Classroom&quot; Rosenthal have shown that students can accurately predict a teacher's perceived effectiveness (as rated at the end of a complete semester) on the basis of just three 2 (TWO) second video clips.<br />So what process do they use to make that evaluation?<BR>How can they be so accurate?<BR>What yardstick(s) are they using to make the evaluation?<BR>We have no idea, because the processing takes place OUTSIDE of the conscious mind.<br />So whether you call it &quot;unconscious&quot;, &quot;subconscious&quot;, &quot;out of conscious&quot;, &quot;non-conscious&quot; or anything else, we clearly have a capacity for mental processing which is something rather more sophisticated than just &quot;lost memory&quot;, as this author suggests.<br />This is the sort of book that greatly appeals to dilitante cynics, offering broad grounds for scepticism regarding numerous topics by way of a host of half-baked &quot;facts&quot; which the reader isn't expected to check out for him/herself.<br />One measure of a truly useful critique is that BOTH sides (or ALL sides) of the story are presented and compared so that the listener/reader can reach their own conclusions.  But don't worry - you'll find nothing that open or constructive in this volume.	2003-10-22

For example, on page 90 Dilts writes<br />&quot;The quality of information that we have in our senses is somehow coded more precisely for the real experience than the imagined one, and that's what makes the difference.&quot;<br />Of course that first phrase doesnt make a lot of sense because the information goes THROUGH our senses to our brain.  Information isnt stored IN our senses,  But that is only half of the problem.  The other half is this (it was written about two years AFTER Sleight of Mouth was published)<br />&quot;We also need to know whether there are reliable ways to distinguish a true memory from a false one.  As of now, there are not, although many behavioural and neuro-imaging studies are attempting to find one.&quot;<br />This comes from a 2001 article co-authored by Elizabeth Loftus.<br />And Elizabeth Loftus, Professor of psychology at the University of Washington, in Seattle, is one of the worlds leading experts on false memory.<br />So who can we believe?  A bloke with no specialist qualifications or experience, or a professor of psychology and inventor of the famous/infamous &quot;shopping mall&quot; experiment?<br />Groupies will no doubt invent reasons why Mr Dilts must know better than erveryone else.

Neuroscientist Michael S. Gazzaniga is mentioned about half a dozen times, and almost every time, even in the Bibliography, his name is spelt \\"Gazzaneza\\".<br />That's it.  End of flaws.<BR>Everything else is just terrific and for anyone interested in hypnosis, or NLP, or both, this is one of those rare books You simply Must Have.<br />At the time of writing Amazon.com were pairing this book with \\"Training Trances\\" - which is a pretty powerful combination.  But the books aren't just two stabs at the same material, they are significantly different views of much of the stuff that NLP is based on, and in particular the work of Milton Erickson.<br />The difference between the two books, and I say this with respect to all the authors, is that where \\"Training Trances\\" tells you what to DO, \\"Monsters and Magical Sticks\\" shows you how to LIVE \\"it\\".<BR>(And in case you were thinking that \\"it\\" is Ericksonian-style hypnosis, as the book's subtitle says: \\"There's No Such Thing As Hypnosis?\\")<br />Just like \\"Training Trances\\", and despite its apparent simplicity this is a book that can be read over and over again.  And each time you read it you'll find something that you didn't get before.<br />If this book is anything to go by, Dr Steven Heller seems to have been very much in the same mould as Milton Erickson, gentle, tolerant, humorous, caring, etc., etc.<BR>At the end of the Epilogue, Nicholas Tharcher has included a brief obituary that includes these words:<br />\\"Though his work and his legacy endures, his presence, his sense of humor, and his enormous energy are gone.  As one of his many friends I miss him.\\"<br />By the time you finish reading this book, the only book by Heller now in print, I wouldn't be at all surprised if you feel much the same way.<br />A great book.

I can't really understand why Mr Dilts thought he had to write this book at all since what it does is re-present some of the most basic NLP techniques as though they were something brand new.  Mr Dilts actually tells us at one point that the ideas he is explaining were formulated in 1980 or thereabouts and so it seems sort of strange that this book came out in 1999.  Why wait so long?  And why go over again material which because of the long delay is now the core material for every book that calls itself an introduction to NLP?<BR>BTW it is slightly inaccurate to suggest that Mr Dilts is anything less than a &quot;well established&quot; author on NLP.  He was involved with the group at Santa Cruz which originally developed NLP, and his earliest books date back at least as far as 1980 when he wrote 'NLP Volume 1' along with Bandler, Grinder and Judith DeLozier.  At least ten of his books, probably more, are still in print.  Are there any other NLP writers who can rival those statistics?	2003-07-13

So why only 2 stars?<BR> <BR>Although there are plenty of interesting facts and figures in this book, it suffers from a very serious case of \\"tunnel vision\\" - in several respects. <br />Firstly the author seems to regard the highly controversial field of so-called evolutionary psychology as being totally reliable. Unfortunately this is not the case, and so we end up with utterly fatuous \\"explanations\\" such as this:<BR> <BR>Why does the natural waking period for adolescents tend to start and end later in the day?<br />\\"Maybe at one point in our history it was important for young people, with good vision and strength, to be more awake and alert later in the day to protect the tribe ... Something is going on that makes adolescents sleep differently than younger kids or older adults\\"<BR> <BR>Despite the fact that this is totally unsupported speculation, albeit by a university-based sleep researcher, it is quoted without the slightest mention that it is reverse logic: Everything is down to evolution, so this MUST have an evolution-based explanation, even if we don't actually have one.<BR> <BR>An even more wondrous comment comes from an anthropologist: <BR>\\"Adolescence is fairly recent ... And it developed because it was a survival mechanism for the species.\\" <br />Explanation? None.<BR>Supporting evidence? None.<br />(For a multi-faceted review of Evolutionary Psychology check out \\"Alas, Poor Darwin\\", Rose & Rose, eds. ISBN 0-099-28319-0.)<br />The second bias follows directly on from the first, namely that the book heavily favours evidence that supports a genetic cause for just about everything. Even when nurture is allowed in we seem to end up with the argument that environmental influences simply trigger genetic propensities.<BR> <BR>And what about this piece of self-contradiction within a single paragraph: <br />\\"Generally we follow a twenty-four-hour cycle, a time frame probably set when amoebas reacted to the turn of the earth on its axis. Studies of those who've volunteered to live in caves or dark labs, though, find that most will push the cycle a bit out of sync, to about 25 hours...\\" <br />Sorry? We've inherited a twenty-FOUR hour cycle from our distant ancestors, YET when left without external controlling influences we revert to a twenty-FIVE hour clock? Where did we get THAT from?<BR> <BR>As usual there is no discussion of the evolutionist \\"explanation\\". <br />This second bias appears to be due, in part, to the author's unquestioning acceptance of studies of identical twins. Which is unfortunate, to say the least, given the questionability of such studies as outlined in \\"They ...You Up\\" (asterisks as in the original) a new book by child psychologist Oliver James which tackles many of the same topics.<br />The third bias follows from the first two - adolescence is discussed in almost total isolation. This is hardly surprising, of course, since the notion that adolescent changes are almost entirely genetically based means that the pre-teenage years become irrelevant. To judge from this book the first decade of human life is of little or no account, and the biological and neurological changes which mark the onset of adolescence must somehow \\"wipe the board clean\\" so that we effectively start as brand new people at around age 10-12.<BR> <BR>Not only is this psychological nonsense, but some of the thinking that arises from such ideas is potentially extremely damaging. One researcher, described as a \\"behavior professor\\", is cited (but not directly quoted) as saying that once young people have the functioning parts there is little reason for teenagers to refrain from having sex. Indeed, we are told that the professor \\"concluded that [the] reticence [of teenagers who don't opt to have sex as soon as they have the 'functioning parts'] must have been due to an immature brain.\\" (pages 158-9).<BR> <BR>Apparently for some the fact that we have far more complex and sophisticated brains than we could possibly need for mere survival - and are NOT utterly dominated by our instincts - is a mere bagatelle. Coming from a country that is already amongst the world leaders for unwanted teenage pregnancies and the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, that might warrant the raising of an eyebrow or two.<BR> <BR>Well-written, interesting, but ultimately very deeply flawed.<BR>Best consumed with a king-sized helping of healthy scepticism.	2003-05-20

The author seems blissfully unaware that the model is neither logical nor about &quot;levels&quot;, and as a consequence resorts to such vacuous statements as &quot;The spiritual level  This is the deepest neurological level ...&quot;<br />The term &quot;neurological&quot; refers to the function and structure of the brain.  In what sense, I wonder, does the author think that the &quot;deepest&quot; function and structure of the human brain is the bit which deals with spiritual matters?  And just what does the author mean by &quot;deepest&quot; in this context, given that &quot;spiritual&quot; is supposedly the &quot;highest&quot; logical level in Dilts' model!<br />To be blunt, there's an awful lot in this book that one could find fault with, and very, very little to commend.  If you're specifically looking for a book on the use of NLP in business I'd recommend David Molden's &quot;Managing with the Power of NLP&quot; or Andrew Bradbury's &quot;Develop Your NLP Skills&quot;.<br />This book is nothing but a total lemon-tinted clunker.	2003-04-17

And so it continued until Europe finally reached the West Coast.<br />There are numerous ramifications of the thesis, including the &quot;force majeur&quot; (might=right) attitude of the settlers towards the Native Americans - with its ominous overtones on the eve of war in the Middle-East.<br />As far as I understand it, for all the &quot;warts&quot;, Turner was looking to UNDERSTAND the American mentality/culture, as shaped by by historical experience, and the Frontier Thesis is a critique, NOT a criticism.<br />Read this book and gain a whole new, or at least greatly expanded, view of what it means to be an &quot;American&quot;.	2003-03-18

As previous reviewers have observed, though this book is eight chapters long you really don't need to read the whole book to get the message - because however radical some readers may think it, the basic idea really doesn't amount to much.<br />To summarise the whole business:  <br />1.  Chomsky says that we can only explain grammar by assuming the existence of a mental organ which no-one has identified or located and wich, according to Chomsky, sprang into existence without the benefit of precursor or the influence of natural selection, just \\"appeared\\".<br />2.  Pinker and Bloom have modified the gross unlikelihood of any such event by invoking natural selection as the \\"father\\" of grammar.<br />3.  Both views of both incredibly unlikely (though not impossible), says Turner, and \\"trades Occam's razor for God's magic hat\\".<br />4.  The mythical grammar organ is not needed because understanding how parable works can explain the rise of both language and grammar.<br />The rest of the book rambles on, and on, AND ON, about not much more than the idea that we can understand why parables are comprehensible by understanding that meaning does not transfer directly from the source (the parable) to the target (\\"real\\" life) but goes through an intermediate \\"blending\\" process.<br />This conflicts, somewhat, with the sweeping claims in the Preface:<br />\\"In this book, I investigate the mechanisms of parable.  I explore technical details of the brain sciences and the mind sciences that cast light on our use of parable as we think, invent, plan, decide, reason, imagine and persuade.  I analyze the activity of parable, inquire into its origin, speculate about its biological and developmental bases, and demonstrate its range.  In the final chapter, I explore the possibility that language is not the source of parable but instead its complex product.\\"<br />Well, I came to the book prepared to agree with Professor Turner's proposition, and I still do - but NOT on the basis of this thinvolume.<br />Not surprisingly, despite the small font, in only 166 pages (plus notes), the book tends to skim its subject in all areas.  And the fact that the author keeps going back to describe the source -> blending space -> target model - without a single diagram! (how \\"literary\\" can you get) - serves to minimise the space available for any other discussion.<br />It would also help if the writer had a better grasp of the English language.  Numerous expressions which he seems to think are every day language read as though they were invented to fit the discussion, such as \\"he had almost arrived at the point of having the job in hand\\".<BR>His translation of Proust produces the phrase \\"I must have overslept myself\\" - perfect Hercule Poirot, but not regular English, I think.<BR>And he has begun to rewrite the English language so as to use phrases like \\"When we see someone startle as he looks in some direction ...\\".  Now a person can BE startled, and a person can startle someone or something else, such as the proverbial horses; but I must confess that I was not aware that someone could startle.  <br />My point, pedantic as these criticisms may appear, is that I got the *impression* that the book was written in a hurry and never properly edited by the author.  Should that last quotation have actually read \\"When we see someone start as ...\\" for example?<br />In practise, the book itself, short though it is, might have benefitted considerably from the use of Occam's razor.<br />So, an interesting thesis, *some* good supporting material, but  seriously undermined as a whole by poor presentation.<br />Definitely one for the academics.	2003-03-17

Both of the previous reviewers make the same point - which I heartily agree with - that this book would be a shoo-in with undergraduates.<br />But what about the rest of the world?<br />This is a fairly short book (152 pages in the main text) divided fairly evenly over five chapters. Nothing surprising there, since the book is the text of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 1999 Massey lectures delivered by Fulford. Unfortunately the \\"lecture\\" element comes across all too clearly, not to mention a certain amount of academic tunnel vision.<br />The author seems to have a thing about the Bible, which he imperiously dismisses several times, apparently ignoring its ongoing best-seller status.<br />Of course buying doesn't necessarily constitute believing, but then we are talking about 'storytelling' here, not about 'religious beliefs', and since the author subsequently makes such a big thing about the influence of Sir Walter Scott's novel \\"Ivanhoe\\", which has had such a (comparatively) short life span, and given the still ongoing battle in the US over the pro- and anti-evolutionist versions of the creation story, it seems strange, not to say biased, that the influence of the Bible is almost totally ignored.<br />Having said that, it's hard to know what the Mr Fulford is actually trying to achieve - other than filling five lecture slots.<BR>The author's take on his subject suggests a man who goes to the zoo and looks at the bipeds and the quadrapeds, the carnivores and the herbivores but who, at the end of the day has no idea what an \\"elephant\\" looks like, and certainly hasn't the faintest idea whether it's the Indian elephants or the African elephants which have the larger ears.<br />Looking back, the book came across as being a collection of ideas, loosely strung together, but none of them developed to any significant degree. Despite the constantly academic tone of the book, the author can be engaging, even amusing, and I found the last two chapters \\"The Cracked Mirror of Modernity\\" and \\"Nostalgia, Knighthood, and the Circle of Dreams\\" thoroughly entertaining. But there's nothing about the contents of the book that really stands out in my mind only a short time after reading it.<br />I've given the book three stars simply on account of its entertainment value. But would I actually recommend it to anyone interested in the storytelling process?<BR>I don't think so.<br />[And it's the African elephants which have the larger ears :) ]	2003-02-23

And whilst the authors do at least mention the meta model - another key concept in NLP - it gets far too little coverage (just 28 pages in a book 354 pages long).<br />On the subject of accuracy, the authors invent presuppositions that are not merely unknown in mainstream NLP but actual contrary to NLP thinking, such as:<br />Genuine NLP presupposition - \\"There is no such thing as failure, only feedback\\" (using the cybernetics definition of \\"feedback\\")<br />Mindworks pseudo-NLP presupposition - \\"You can turn failure into feedback\\"<br />How do you turn something INTO feedback if it already IS feedback? <br />The authors appear to be equally at a loss when it comes to simple matters of fact. For example, they baldly state that:<br />' \\"The map is not the territory\\" is an NLP presupposition that's taken from Noam Chomsky'<br />Oh really? So why does everyone else (correctly) attribute the epigram to Alfred Korzybski, creator of General Semantics?<br />To cut to the chase, this book is too long-winded, too inaccurate, and too poorly written to be worth even the original cover price.<BR>Definitely NOT recommended.	2003-02-08

Amongst the many ways we decide how to interact with the world around us is a pattern called &quot;options and procedures&quot;.<br />Options people, &quot;free spirits&quot;, hate procedures - detailed lists of instructions - unless they are creating such a list for someone else.  By the same token, a strongly options person is almost pathalogically incapable of following any set of instructions or rule &quot;to the letter&quot;.  They just &quot;must&quot; customise it in some way (that's if they don't junk it completely).<br />So guess what, if this description sounds at all like you, there's very little chance that you'll even finish reading this book, let alone find it useful.<br />HOWEVER<br />If you're a &quot;procedures&quot; person - someone who loves to run their life according to various sets of rules, someone who can actually feel nauseous at the very thought of abandoning their daily routine, no matter how good the cause - then you'll probably find this book is entirely consistent with your view of how life ought to be.<br />If you think I'm over simplifying things, just read some of the previous reviews, especially where people specify what they think is good or bad about the book.<br />Oh, just one other thing - just because someone tells you that life can be summed up in ten short rules doesn't make it so.<br />Believe me?  Avoid the book.<BR>Don't believe me?  You'll love it.	2002-12-20

But what is a &quot;complete introduction&quot; to NLP? In their book 'Introducing NLP', authors O'Connor and Seymour give what they describe as a 'Three Minute Seminar' on NLP. That might equally qualify as a &quot;complete introduction&quot; to NLP, depending on your interpretation of the words &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;introduction&quot;.<BR>And does the word &quot;complete&quot; apply to &quot;introduction&quot; only, or to the rest of the subtitle? In either case I'd seriously question its accuracy.<br />And what about the claim, in the Foreward, that:<br />&quot;[the authors] have synthesised the NLP practitioner information and brought a new clarity to the field. ... While Harry and Beryl are not the developers of NLP, they play a critical role in moving NLP to the next level.&quot;<br />It turns out that all this comment means is: \\"The authors got an NLP book published by a mainstream publisher.\\"  Yes they did, but rather a long time (several years) after O'Connor and Seymour, so hardly a \\"critical role\\".<br />This book is, in fact, a rather verbose and not particularly competent introduction to the SOME of the basics of NLP. A &quot;training programme&quot; it is NOT, for the same reason that no book is a training programme - human beings learn very little just by reading about it. Especially in this particular field of activity.<br />I personally found the writing uninspired, conveying nothing of the 'magic' of NLP. Moreover, having decided to write the whole book in E-Prime (a fad if ever there was one!) the authors trap themselves in the kind of sentence construction that NLP highlights as being the basis of poor communication. For example, what did the authors mean by this statement:<br />&quot;Our personal mind programmes (sic) constitute the 'map'. They include so-called 'meta programmes' (sic), our higher-level thinking patterns such as our values, beliefs and other personality traits.&quot;<br />Is that supposed to mean that our &quot;personal mind programmes&quot; include meta programs AND our &quot;higher-level thinking patterns&quot;; or does it mean that &quot; 'meta programmes' (sic)&quot; ARE &quot;higher-level thinking patterns&quot;?<BR>And why is 'meta programs' spelt 'meta programmes'? Are the authors not aware that the 'program' in 'meta program' is adopted from computing terminology?<br />We also need to ask why the authors refer to them as &quot;so-called 'meta programmes'(sic)&quot;? Do they mean that meta programs aren't really meta programs in some sense? And is that why meta programs are almost totally ignored in this allegedly &quot;complete introduction&quot;?<br />Indeed, the more I read of this book, the more I wondered if the authors really knew what they were writing about.  For example, there are several references (more than the 6 referenced in the Index) to left and right brain activity, such as:<br />&quot;This calls upon natural, 'right brain' intuitive skills ...&quot;<br />Surely this myth of exclusivity in left and right brain activities was laid to rest years ago?<br />&quot;Neuro-Linguistic Programming builds on the ideas of the anthropologist Gregory Bateson.&quot;<br />What - the whole of NLP?  What about Satir, Erickson, Korzybski, Perls, etc., etc.?<br />The notion that &quot;Auditory Digital&quot; is a representational system in its own right, but apparently taste (gustatory) and smell (olfactory) no longer qualify.  Thus the original list of representational systems - visual, auditory, kinesthetic, Olfactory and Gustatory (VAKOG) - has been transformed, with no explanation, into VAKAd!<br />Then there is the very confused section on 'Switching Submodalities' where the authors quite rightly observe that: <br />&quot;Association tends to intensify a feeling. Conversely, recalling a traumatic experience in a dissociated way will typically cause less pain ...&quot;<br />but only after they have recommended that the reader switch to the associated state when recalling an unhappy memory in order to apply &quot;the 'happiness code' to the content. Such switching may work well under the direction of an experienced guide, but I seriously doubt the wisdom of recommending this course of action to a complete beginner.<br />And why does the discussion of The Convincer Strategy (day 17) cover convincer modes (what kind of evidence is convincing) but not convincer channels (how frequently or for how long the evidence must be encountered to become convincing)? <br />Returning to Bateson, on page 197 the authors state that &quot;the anthropologist Gregory Bateson originated a model of neurological levels, later developed by Robert Dilts as shown in figure 14.1.&quot;<br />Not actually true, I'm afraid, for the following reasons:<br />Bateson invented a model of &quot;logical levels of learning - which had to do with levels of abstraction (learning, learning about learning, learning about learning about learning, and so on) - which has nothing to do with neurological levels.<BR>On the contrary, where Bateson's model is both logical and about &quot;levels&quot;, the Dilts model isn't logical, and doesn't feature any true \\"levels\\".<br /> Moreover, the illustration in figure 14.1 isn't the Neurological Levels model at all, though the authors keep calling it that. It is, in fact, just the plain Logical Levels model, a fact that is easily verified since the illustration doesn't include a single one of the 'nervous system' labels that are in Dilts' Neurological Levels model.<br />Having said all that, its only fair to mention that there are several passages in the text which must stand out as worthwhile in anybody's book (!). I'm particularly thinking of the section entitled 'Soft Front Ends', which gives some very useful advice on how to ask meta model questions with sensitivity; of the exercises at the end of thechapter on metaphors; and of 'ALIGNMENT', a section which demonstrates how to apply the idea of neurological levels to real life situations.<br />Unfortunately, for the reasons stated above I really wouldn't be happy about recommending this book to a complete novice. And unless you are a complete novice I can't see any reason to read something this basic. Especially when you consider that O'Connor and Seymour's 'Introducing NLP' is more accurate, more complete, and cheaper!<BR>In short, definitely 'Not Recommended'.	2002-12-04

I've already reviewed that book so I'll not go into it in detail other than to say it was abyssmal.<br />The next book, \\"Delay of Execution\\", marks something of a comeback, but it still isn't anything much to write home about.<br />The problems are, basically, in the areas highlighted by the reviewer from Seattle. The characters are thoroughly two dimensional - even Mrs Malory - and the plot is totally sequential with not a diversion or red herring in sight.<br />This is not to say that the identity of the murder is ever obvious - it isn't, not even to Mrs Malory - and far from our heroine detecting the motive and identity of the \\"executioner\\" that person simply owns up on the spur of the moment, even though they clearly are no longer under suspicion.<br />As a light read about the kind of politiking that goes on in an English private school the story reads smoothly and is mildly interesting. As a murder mystery, however, it is pretty weak, not least because the author never really engages our sympathy for either of the two women who die.<br />In each case there is considerable ambiguity about whether the death was an accident or a murder, but the ambiguity is never developed upon so as to create any real tension. Still, having said that, at just 212 pages this isn't exactly a major tome, and I personally found the plotting substantial enough to hold my attention for the limited amount of time it took me to read the book through to the end.<br />In short, the quality of the story telling is still a long way off the author's earlier standard, and whilst it's a pleasant enough time filler, I'd be wary of recommending it to anyone who isn't already a DEDICATED fan of Mrs Malory's adventures, and maybe not even then.	2002-11-23

The book does NOT demonstrate or explain how to use hypnosis in training 'in general'.<br />What the authors have created is an almost unique and very useful resource which teaches Ericksonian hypnosis by using hypnotic techniques within the text.  This definitely works, in fact almost 'too' well - for a couple of months after reading this book I began to go into a trance no matter what book I was reading [more of a trance than usual :) ] !<br />Much of the book, a rich mixture of demonstration, explanation and exercises, is based on the authors' own training workshops and I personally found that this came across to very good effect.<br />I wouldn't suggest that any book could make you an expert in a subject like hypnosis, but this strikes me as an excellent basic text for anyone wanting to study Erickson's techniques.<br />Having said that, some readers may find the book a little narrow in its scope, in which case I'd ALSO recommend &quot;Hypnosis: A Comprehensive Guide&quot;, by Flores, Schober and James (ISBN 1899836454), another practical guide which contrasts the Ericksonian approach with two other styles of hypnosis, IN ADDITION to this book.	2002-09-29

You just cannot know whether you've really learnt anything worthwhile until you get in the water and start using whatever you've been taught.<br />So, to ALL of the previous reviewers: Whatever you said about this book - You're Right.<br />It is a good book full of useful ideas, AND it's a load of B.S. stories.  What determines what you learn from this book isn't the contents - but YOUR PERCEPTION of the contents.  And that's why its written the way it is.<br />If you'll excuse a little mind reading, it seems clear that Richard Bandler developed a belief, very early on in his NLP career, that the type of teaching that he liked best was something called &quot;unconscious installation&quot;.<BR>What this rather sinister label means is simply what I've just described:  Instead of standing in front of the learner and telling them what they should know, the teacher tells a series of stories/parables/metaphors/etc. which contain the things s/he thinks the learner needs to know.<br />BUT<br />There is an essential difference between this almost Eastern style of teaching and the traditional Western approach: In Western teaching the student is supposed to be able to replicate what s/he has been taught in exams - regardless of whether s/he has actually UNDERSTOOD anything.<br />The Eastern approach says something like: No two people, hearing the same words, interpret them in EXACTLY the same way.  Therefore when I teach you I will allow for the fact that whatever I say to you will be processed inside your head in line with the ideas, beliefs, values, etc., that are already in there.<br />So, if you prefer the Western approach, where things are served up in a sequential and &quot;blatant&quot; manner, the chances are that you won't like this book.  Though you may want to dip a toe in the water just to see what it's like.<br />If, on the other hand, you are willing to become actively involved in the learning process, and evaluate the teaching by the RESULTS it produces rather than by the format of the PRESENTATION then just dive in - the water's lovely.	2002-09-29

Having seen the previous reviews, I came to this book with high hopes.  They were never realised.  Obviously the author has hit the nail squarely on the head for some readers, but I'll be hornswoggled if I can tell why.<br />When I got to the end of the book I was still waiting for something, Anything, that would turn my dissatisfaction into a feeling that it had all been worthwhile.  But my hopes simply weren't met.<br />OK.  Do you see a pattern in those first two paragraphs?  Lots of tantalising &quot;odours&quot; but nothing to get your teeth into.  That is how this book was *for me*.<br />The book starts well.<BR>Chapter 1: The Six Stories You Need to Know How to Tell.  Great stuff - for the first 26 pages,  But somehow that seems to be the nearest we come to anything concrete regarding the art of storytelling.  It is followed by over 200 pages of text, but those 200+ pages concentrate almost entirely on &quot;what&quot; you should do, with far too little on &quot;how&quot; to do it.<br />Things weren't helped by the story at the start of Chapter 6: Sound Bite or Epic.  I was already halfway through the book, and still wondering when we were going to get to the meat and potatoes, and the &quot;Somali tale from Ethiopia&quot; about a woman going to a shaman who tells her to get hold of a tiger's whisker, really pulled the plug.<BR>Firstly Somalia (where Somali's come from) and Ethiopia are two separate countries, next-door neighbours, who spend much of the time at each other's throats.  Secondly they don't have &quot;shamans&quot; in Africa, they have witch doctors, etc.  Thirdly, there are no tigers in Africa, only lions (tigers are found on the Indian subcontinent).<br />Now you might think this is nit picking, especially since the story itself does illustrate a valid point.<BR>My problem is that this kind of presentation strikes me as being thoroughly disrespectful.  It confuses Somalia and Ethiopia, it lumps all &quot;wise men&quot; under the trendy label &quot;shaman&quot;, and it shows a basic ignorance of nature.  In short, *to me* it says: &quot;I'm telling a story, I don't have to go to the bother of actually getting the factual bits right - not even in the attribution.&quot;<br />Fine, but if an author want me to pay them for what they're offering then I believe they DO owe their readers sufficient respect to avoid making such basic errors.<br />My biggest concern, however, is that the book simply doesn't &quot;walk its talk&quot;.<BR>If storytelling - &quot;or just &quot;story&quot;, as the author whimsically insists on calling it through most of the book - is supposed to be so effective, shouldn't the book actually *illustrate* this fact rather than just telling me about it?<BR>Why, for example, are a number of the stories included in the book presented in cut down form instead of allowing the reader to savour - and learn from - the full length version?<br />This author apparently runs workshops on various aspects of storytelling, and for all I know these may be incredibly stimulating and effective.  Unfortunately, I found no such excitement in this book, just the same few messages - &quot;storytelling is wonderful&quot;, &quot;storytelling builds bridges&quot;, etc. - repeated over and over and OVER again.<br />For my money, just about ANY book by Idries Shah will give more insight into storytelling than &quot;The Story Factor&quot; - even the books that (apparently) contain nothing but stories.	2002-07-31

Yet even here, the approach is so utterly basic that only a reader with absolutely NO prior knowledge of NLP could be impressed.<br />If you want to REALLY get to grips with the material discussed in this book you may prefer to forget about &quot;Selling the Way ...&quot; and get yourself a copy of Shelle Rose Charvet's book &quot;Words that Change Minds&quot; - also based (with far greater understanding, IMO) on the same source material) instead.<br />Because that's a book that REALLY delivers the goods!	2002-06-12

For example, Joe Bloggs frequently, and apparently sincerely, expresses a desire to lose weight - but he never does.<BR>Why?<BR>Because Joe has an unspoken belief that he will be safe from mugging so long as he looks big enough to wrestle a bull.<br />This isn't exactly rocket science. The genius of this book is that Kegan and Lahey have taken the \\"secondary gain\\" principle and repackaged it (without the usual psycho-babble) in a way that, hopefully, will appeal to the business community at large.<br />To this end they have developed a means by which people can quickly and easily - if they are willing - uncover what the authors call the \\"competing commitment\\" that undermines a person's declared commitment in a given situation.<br />For example, manager Fred Katz has the declared commitment of empowering his subordinates. Yet he briefs his people on a strictly \\"need to know\\" basis (and of course only Fred knows what his people \\"need\\" to know).<br />Using Kegan and Lahey's approach, described in detail in this book, Fred might discover that he has a competing commitment to gain promotion by demonstrating his indispensability. This he can only achieve, as he sees it, by keeping his people dependent on him as the one person in the department who has access to the \\"big picture\\".<br />Will this self-knowledge guarantee that Fred changes his behaviour?<BR>Not necessarily. But at least he has a better understanding of his situation and is in a position to look for ways of achieving *both* commitments (empowerment AND promotion) in a constructive and non-conflicting manner.<br />Along with the main thrust of the book, the authors make a number of observations that are absolutely key elements of better management skills, including:<br /> - sometimes it's better tolet a problem ride, giving yourself a chance to learn from it, rather than trying to \\"fix\\" every little blip the moment it appears<BR> - \\"The changing that people do because others make them costs an organisation a very dear price and is much shorter lived than the changing people do because they have first changed their minds\\"<br />This is a book that EVERY manager can benefit from reading, even those who think they have already achieved optimum performance.<br />My one criticism of the book - the reason why I have only given it four stars - is that flow of the text is regularly interrupted by lapses into poor grammar and sentence construction. And this despite, one assumes, the attentions of a professional editor.<BR>How, for example, did this paragraph ever get into print?:<br />\\"But how exactly might we further creating and practicing this language in real life work (as opposed to merely illustrating it)?\\"<br />And a few lines later:<br />\\"Whatever salable [sic] product they have produced ...\\"<br />Surely even a basic scan of the text with a decent spelling/grammar checker would have been sufficient to pick up items like this?	2002-06-11

It's an excellent book but it was a little strange to see it referred to by some critics as \\"new\\", and an example of \\"breakthrough thinking\\".<br />Why?<br />Because although the two books are not addressing *exactly* the same area, Ms Charvet's \\"Words that Change Minds\\", first published in 1996, can readily be seen as a precursor to the later book.<br />Although it is usually referred to in connection with Rodger Bailey's LAB Profile work, this book is in fact based on a subset of the \\"meta programs\\", or mental filters, first identified by Leslie Lebeau (formerly Leslie Cameron-Bandler).<br />What makes this book so valuable is that instead of simply describing the meta programs on a purely theoretical level (as many previous authors had done), Ms Charvet places each one in a very practical context.  She tells us not only the basics of each meta program but also such practical details as:<br /> - what questions to use to elicit a person's position on any of the meta programs discussed<BR> - how to identify what meta program positions are best suited to a given job<BR> - and how to frame a job or product advert so that it \\"speaks to\\" the optimum audience<br />There is also a wealth of anecdotes from real life that illustrate the meta programs at work - like why the US was never comfortable as members of UNESCO, why a single word undermined one of IBM's big advertising campaigns, and why a Jewish mother may recommend chicken soup because \\"it couldn't hurt\\".<br />And on top of all that, the book is written in an enthusiastic, flowing style that makes reading it both easy and enjoyable.<br />Highly recommended for *anyone* who wants to understand the practicalities of how language works.	2002-06-10

The 16 Basic Desires That Motivate Our Actions and Define Our Personalities	Books	1	61	124	N	N	Beware - wolf in sheep's clothing	I have two concerns about this book.<BR> <BR>Firstly, although it is entitled \\"Who Am I?\\" it might have been more appropriate, not to mention more honest, to call the book \\"What Am I?\\". <br />The answer to \\"who am I?\\", for this author, is: Steven Reiss, professor of psychology and psychiatry at Ohio State University.<BR> <BR>The answer to \\"*what* am I?\\", for this author, is (whether he admits to it or not): An evolutionary psychologist, and consequently we humans are merely an expression of our genes. Both physically *and* psychologically.<BR> <BR>The justification for this statement is clearly stated on page 25:<BR> <BR>\\"Our basic desires have an evolutionary origin, but they are significantly modified by culture, beliefs, and individual experiences in ways that are still not well understood. What we desire is largely determined by our genes, but how we fulfill our desires is largely determined by culture and experience.\\" <br />Notice that even the *way* we fulfil our desires is partly governed by genetics. In fact, for Reiss, genetics are the *true* key to everything else (page 24):<BR> <BR>\\"... even if the average strength of the 16 basic desires were found to vary across cultures, I expect that the definitions of the 16 basic desires presented in this book would be proven to be universal. I base this expectation partially on the genetic origin of the desires.\\" <br />One of the problems with this \\"it all depends on your genes\\" attitude is that this is basically a dead end definition. In order to expand on the notion we have to take unproven and frequently unprovable jumps into the dark. And the end result is frequently non-sense, nonsense, or both. As in these three assertions on page 19: <br />1. \\"nearly everyone wants success (indicating desire for power)\\" <br />There's only one definition of \\"success\\", and that is \\"success = power\\"?<BR>Well, I suppose if we're all just troop carriers for our genes then that kind of thinking makes some kind of sense. Not a lotof good when you're dealing with individual human beings, though. <br />2. \\"animals who hoard food are motivated by the desire to save\\" <br />Since the author has \\"Saving ... the desire to collect things\\" as one of his 16 definitions I suppose that a squirrel hoarding nuts so it will have a food supply through the winter is acting on exactly the same genetically determined motivation that leads a human being to collect, say, stamps (referring to a true philatelist as distinct from someone who collects stamps simply as an investment)? <br />Interesting idea - but perhaps not exactly rational.<BR> <BR>3. \\"animals' common practice of licking themselves clean falls under the desire for order\\"<BR> <BR>And does it have nothing to do with the fact that cleanliness is an aid to health, or that an undue amount of dirt may conceal the animal's scent, and/or its ability to effectively detect smells in its environment? Not to mention the fact that \\"order\\" may be an entirely human concept.<BR> <BR>Whilst the list of 16 allegedly basic desires makes an interesting talking point, so-called evolutionary psychology has not gained any substantial measure of support within the scientific community, and this book offers nothing that makes such ideas any more credible than they were before.<BR> <BR>My second concern is about people who use expressions like: \\"We instructed the computer\\" (page 27).<BR> <BR>Computers are not \\"instructed\\" (as you would give instructions to another human being), they are \\"programmed\\" - with the clear implication that someone else (a human being) did the programming.<br />This distinction is vital, in a context such as this.<BR>What Reiss is clearly attempting to depict as a totally computer-controlled, neutral process - the selection of 16 basic desires from a short list of 328, \\"based on root meanings\\" - is nothing of the kind.<BR> <BR>A computer only \\"understands\\" 0 and 1, on and off - it hasn't the faintest idea what a \\"root meaning\\" is, and it has no power to do anything other than run the program fed into it, using the data fed into it - all done by *human beings*, and therefore HIGHLY selective. And for honesty's sake should be acknowledged as such.	2002-06-04

And here's why (it's a statement from this authors new book - it is framed as a discussion with himself):<br />&quot;What I wrote about resistance in my [first] book is great for people who are working in what I call Push Mode.<br />What do you mean by that?<br />It's the opposite of what I call Pull Mode.  Essentially the difference is that in Push Mode you are pushing yourself towards your goals.  In Pull Mode you are allowing your goals to pull you towards them.  The results may look much the same, but Pull Mode is much less effortful [sic] and relies more on the unconscious activity of the brain rather than conscious linear processing.&quot;<br />Clearly even the author doesn't think there's any point in buying this book, as it will only show you how to do things the hard way.<br />So maybe you'll want to get the new book instead, so you can be right up to date.<br />Or better yet, why not hang on for a little while.  No doubt there'll be yet another book along soon to show us an even better way of managing our lives?<br />Alternatively, I suspect many readers will be smart enough to spot the pattern and will choose to invest in an author who doesn't completely change their mind every time the sales figures for their current book start to dip.	2002-06-02

Another \\"expert\\" on change management offers the following scenario:<br />If you were on a North Sea oil platform it is very unlikely that you'd jump 40 feet into the icy water just because someone said you should.  If the platform were on fire, on the other hand, you'd probably jump without having to be told.<br />So, if you want to make a change management programme successful, just frighten people by demonstrating that they have more to lose by staying put than they do if they \\"jump\\".<br />Sound familiar?<BR>Isn't Kotter's recommendation to establish a sense of urgency by analyzing competition and identifying potential crises another version of the same strategy?<br />The problem is that we know that people under threat/stress become LESS flexible, LESS creative, LESS willing to take risks. In short, they are in the worst possible state to successfully implement a change management programme.<br />So what price the \\"burning platform\\" strategy - by any name you care to give it?<br />This is the sort of book that appeals to a certain type of executive because it allows them to blame everyone else when their change programme fails.  Whast it doesn't tell them is that \\"command and control\\" management is the root cause of fiascos like BPR, \\"burning platforms\\" and the like.<br />With all due respect this is a blueprint for failure.<BR>Definitely one to avoid like the plague.	2002-05-18

It gives the layman an idea of what an NLP session should be like.\\"<br />Basically this is a set of trancescripts (pun intended) of Richard Bandler doing brief therapy the NLP way. They cover topics such as a rather unusual form of agoraphobia, fear of authority figures, weight loss, changing limiting beliefs, etc.<br />More than that, however, they show Bandler using many of the core NLP techniques to facilitate lasting changes, typically in less than 30 minutes.<br />An additional feature of the first three sessions is that they are taken from a project at Marshall University, West Virginia, and in two cases include a brief follow-up interview that took place about 8 months after the therapy session.<BR>(Only two, because in one case Richard and his client went straight out and demonstrated that the client's agoraphobia had already completely disappeared.)<br />As the previous reviewer has said, this is a book that will bear, indeed requires, several readings to get the most out of it. Bandler himself (or was it the unnamed editor?) recommends that, after having read the whole book, you start again, annotating each transcript in the same way that the final chapter has already been analysed, to better understand how Bandler has used various linguistic patterns to achieve his results.<BR>Seems like a pretty good idea to me.<br />The book gives some interesting insights into the attitude, motivation and practice of the originator of NLP.  At the same time, though Bandler certainly isn't prepared to spoonfeed his readers, it is as gooda teaching tool as any book could ever be.<br />If you're serious about NLP, this book is a definite 'must read'.	2002-05-01

But what's it all about?  Tennis in the Boardroom?  Golf swings by the water cooler?<br />Myles Downey's book, despite its relative brevity, makes an excellent job of introducing some of the key considerations involved in training or hiring business coaches.  At 135 pages (including the Introduction) you obviously aren't going to get an in-depth explanation of what coaching can do for you and/or your company.  What I think you WILL get is a pretty good feeling for whether coaching is something you want to get involved with.<br />If that makes the book sound a bit airy-fairy, I apologise.  Mr Downey also does an excellent job of laying the groundwork for becoming an &quot;effective coach&quot; - if that's what you're after.  There are plenty of very practical tips, including useful models, such as the &quot;Spectrum of Coaching Skills&quot; and the &quot;GROW&quot; (or &quot;TO GROW&quot;) outline for any coaching session.<br />One of the highlights of the book as far, as I was concerned, was the inclusion of snippets of dialogue (ranging from a few lines to several pages in length) used to actually demonstrate how to handle various elements of the coaching function.<br />The one element of the book I felt a little uneasy about was Mr Downey's hypothesis that a manager can also function as coach to one of his/her subordinates.  As Mr Downey himself points out, facts and thoughts might emerge during a coaching session that could potentially be somewhat damaging when it comes to appraisal time.  There seems to be an assumption that a &quot;good&quot; manager could somehow separate the two functions and ignore in 'manager mode' the things s/he has learnt whilst in 'coaching mode'.<br />I'd suggest that this is a piece of impractical idealism, which places an unrealistic and unfair burden upon the manager and the coachee alike.<br />Rather than sweeping such considerations under the rug, it seems to me that coaching is likely to remain a fad until issues such as this have been fully addressed and resolved.	2002-04-10

Even more astonishing is the fact that he produced the initial version of his book nearly fifty years before that - in 1805!<br />Of course there are plenty of other books around which date back far farther than that - Shakespeare, the Bible, Milton's Paradise Lost, and so on - but the books that last are normally prose works, like those I've just mentioned.<BR>What's so impressive, to my mind, is that Roget hit upon a way of producing a *reference* work which, in all this time, no-one has been able to improve upon.<BR>(There ARE other books purporting to be thesauruses (thesauri?) but Roget's original format is still the best.) <br />As a writer I'm particularly aware that one of the cardinal sins, in fact or fiction, is to re-use a distinctive word twice in the same sentence, or even in two distinct sentences that are close together.  In fact it causes trouble even if you use two variations of the same word in close proximity - as I hope I've just demonstrated with &quot;distinctive&quot; and &quot;distinct&quot;.<br />The reason this causes problems, of course, is because the reader's flow is interrupted as they sort out which instance of the word they just read.  You read the second occurence of the word and think something like &quot;One minute, I just read that, now I've read it again - or did I lose my place and simply re-read the original word a second time.&quot;<br />What you need, then, is TWO words which mean the same thing - which your trusty Thesaurus is just waiting to provide, offer, supply, give, etc.<br />So, Roget's Thesaurus rocks!<br />BUT, there is a potential downside, so be warned -<br />Once you start using Roget's Thesaurus, you may well find that you begin to love words.  You start off looking for a simple synonym and you notice an unfamiliar word nearby, so you go off to look at it.  Next thing you know your simplesearch has turned into a pleasant browse through the riches of the English language.<br />You may even find your day-to-day vocabulary swelling beyond the mere 2,000-3,000 words that most people get by on.  You may find that you can express yourself more clearly and precisely.  People may enjoy listening to you, or reading what you have written ...<br />Good grief, is that the time!<BR>Buy this thesaurus - you'll never regret it, honest, really, Scout's honour, it's a fact, you can count on it!	2002-03-27

The first edition of this book showed poor writing skills, bad layout, and even worse proof-reading.<br />This is the second edition.  The layout is greatly improved' and the proof-reading is a whole lot better.  Unfortunately, however, the writing is as bad as ever, and is slightly less &quot;spirited&quot; than a dead fish.<br />The basic problem seems to be that this author confuses &quot;quantity&quot; with &quot;quality&quot;.  His output is indeed prodigious, but the books all tend to read like catalogues - all the facts, presented in a totally deadpan manner.<br />In practice there are now far too many NLP books available, of far higher quality, to leave much room for such poor writing.<br />For a good, all-round introduction to NLP, O'Connor and Seymour's &quot;Introducing NLP&quot; leaves this standing on the starting line.<br />Incidentally, the book categorically DOES NOT contain &quot;significant contributions from other master trainers&quot;, not unless you imagine that quoting someone means that they've made a &quot;significant contribution&quot; to your book.<br />In reality, for better oe worse, the writing is pure wall-to-wall Michael Hall.<BR>If you've enjoyed any of Michael's other books then you may enjoy this one as well.  If you didn't, it's VERY unlikely that you'll like this one either.	2002-03-22

Get yourself a copy of Bob Walter's book &quot;Discovering Operational Discipline&quot; and rediscover one of the REAL secrets of success: The best solutions are usually the simplest.<br />At first glance you might well assume that this book doesn't amount to much.  The cover design is excellent, but the text is only 78 pages from cover to cover (including acknowledgements, Table of Contents, etc.).  Moreover there is plenty of &quot;white space&quot; on nearly every page.<br />It's only as you begin to read the book, structured around Walters' 15 key characteristics of Organisational Discipline, that you begin to realise how powerful these characteristics can be.<br />In the last section of the book, Walters describes complete programmes for introducing Organisational Discipline to your company and/or your personal life, based on getting people to buy-in to the philosophy rather than trying to impose the process from above (though a highly placed &quot;champion&quot; is always a bonus, of course).<br />Just imagine how things might be different if everyone in your company/department/team was consistently committed to taking &quot;personal responsibility for their actions&quot;, if everyone was driven by a &quot;desire to use resources efficiently&quot;, and if the practise of &quot;repecting and understanding each others' worldviews&quot; were the rule rather than the exception.  (Just three of the 15 characteristics.)<br />Better yet, imagine it, then buy the book and start putting it into practice.	2002-03-22

Not simply because of the gut-wrenching stories of abuse, but more importantly because of the totally negative \\"solutions\\" it offers.<br />All the way through the book I was aware of a feeling of pure rage and hatred emanating from the text. Just my imagination? I don't think so. Check this giveaway passage (from a \\"fairy tale\\" created by one of the author's patients) on page 287:<br />'Ivy [for Incest Victim] panicked. \\"But there's no way over the river,'\\" she cried. \\"Yes there is,\\" cooed Susan victoriously. \\"You may *ride on my outrage*. It has carried me far, and it will carry you too.\\" '<br />(emphasis added)<br />What a powerful, and revealing, description that is!<br />This constant harping on anger and rage is not simply aesthetically unappealing - it is bad psychology. In Chapter 9 - \\"You Don't Have to Forgive\\" - the author tells us quite categorically (page 187) that:<br />'One of the most dangerous things about forgiveness is that it undercuts your ability to let go of your pent-up emotions.'<br />Firstly, forget the \\"most cherished religious, spiritual, philosophical, and psychological principles\\" that the author rejects. The fact is that we have plenty of hard scientific evidence that holding a grudge will upset your body's chemistry resulting in significant physiological damage such as ulcers, heart problems and/or other stress-related illnesses.<br />Indeed, the whole claim (page 185) that:<br />'... it is not necessary to forgive your parents in order to feel better about yourself and to change your life!'<br />rings pretty hollow as far as I can hear.<br />Secondly, if the author thinks it so important that victims hang on to this raw edge in order to be able to let go of pent-up emotions, what sense can we make of the following description of a therapy group for incest victims (page 277):<br />'Every time a new member is initiated, group members must repeat what has long been unspoken. The more often this happens, the more everyone in the group is desensitized to the shame and guilt.'<br />If simple repetition is really so successful in dealing with shame and guilt - which are presumably amongst those \\"pent-up emotions\\" - why is it necessary for victims to refuse to forgive? Do different emotions have to be dealt with in different ways? Will the anger and rage still persist after the shame and guilt have (allegedly) gone?<br />Indeed, can we even take seriously this idea that repetition provides an effective way of clearing negative emotions? Again, the practical evidence is that repetition does not *clear* bad memories. Rather it literally *fixes* them more firmly in your brain. We may be \\"desensitized\\" on the surface, even as all hell breaks loose at the subconscious level.<br />This is, in fact, a good example of how being a victim or a \\"survivor\\" becomes an essential element of someone's core identity.<br />(\\"Victim\\" and \\"survivor\\" are actually very similar roles in that they both keep us looking backwards, chained to the past, instead of allowing us to let go of the past and move on.)<br />Nor was I reassured by this passage on 'confronting your aggressor' (page 294):<br />'1. ... If the aggressor claims not to remember, ask him to acknowledge that even though *he* doesn't remember, it must be true because *you* remember.'<br />Has the author never heard of false memory syndrome?<br />Both America and Britain have seen major child abuse witch hunts take place based on nothing more than this simple assumption - that everything a child says it remembers is bound to be a TRUE memory.  (Not forgetting the overenthusiastic care workers who \\"help\\" the children to \\"remember\\" non-existent events.)<br />The fact is that many children can VERY easily be talked into remembering things that never happened at all. Getting a child to mis-interpret an essentially innocent event - to favour one side or the other in a custody battle, for example - is just as easy, ifnot easier.<br />Despite the claim that this is the route to \\"reclaiming your life\\" I strongly suspect that whilst, superficially, it may *appear* to bring benefits, it is *actually* more likely (at a deeper level) to perpetuate the destructive effects of the initial abuse.easier.<br />Despite the claim that this is the route to \\"reclaiming your life\\" I strongly suspect that whilst, superficially, it may *appear* to bring benefits, it is *actually* more likely (at a deeper level) to perpetuate the destructive effects of the initial abuse.	2002-03-16

That is to say, though it claims to be offering to tell you &quot;how&quot; to do something (in this case, &quot;How to command attention, change minds, and influence people&quot;) it actually only tells you &quot;what&quot; to do.  It covers the gap with a stream of brief stories of the &quot;Wow, I never knew that!&quot; variety, &quot;swept up&quot; from a whole slew of books on more or less the same subject.<br />It is my perception that *anybody* who has read the same set of source books, and has a reasonable grasp of written English, could have produced this book, regardless of whether they had any prior knowledge or experience of the subject.<br />For beginners (in any subject), especially those who set more store by what they &quot;know&quot; rather than by what they can actually &quot;do&quot;, this &quot;canned knowledge&quot; approach can be very attractive.  Indeed, it may well lead them to assume that the book itself is of some value.<br />For the more discerning reader - one who wishes to be able to put their knowledge to work - this favourable impression lasts just about as long as it takes them to find a more pragmatically-oriented text.<br />If you *really* want to be well-informed about &quot;the new psychology of influence&quot; I'd recommend Robert Cialdini's classic &quot;Influence&quot;, and for an introductory handbook on the effective and responsible use of influence/persuasion, Andrew Bradbury's &quot;Develop Your NLP Skills&quot;.<br />Both books are well-written (that is, easy to read)yet contain far more *practical* information than &quot;Artful Persuasion&quot;.	2002-03-15

(Ms Pym, I hasten to add, did NOT die under mysterious circumstances of any kind!)<br />As the book approaches its halfway point this initial focus shifts slightly and the pace becomes somewhat more relaxed. Indeed, it almost seems - for a page or two - as though the author is running out of steam....<br />At this point Ms Holt elegantly drops a bombshell into the proceedings, a bombshell which, it now turns out, she has been subtly preparing us for over the previous 20-30 pages.<br />There are more such finely calculated surprises to come, and the second half of the book revolves around an excellent development of the previously established plot lines in which - after the fashion of premier thriller-writer Robert Ludlam - nothing and no-one is quite what/who they appear to be.<br />The final revelation of the killer is managed in true Malory style, sitting round a kitchen table. It is done quietly, even discreetly, and above all, the denoument makes sense.<br />If I had to offer a criticism it would be that Ms Holt gives little opportunity for the reader to come to their own idea as to \\"who dunnit\\".<BR>For example, Mrs Malory's final unravelling of the mystery depends on two key pieces of evidence. Of the two, one is never shown to the reader, whilst the second is (so far as I can tell) deliberately mis-described.<BR>(To be fair, this mis-direction is genuinely essential to the plotting, and an accurate description would have given the game away quite some time before the formal solving of the puzzle.)<br />Anyway, this one qualification apart, and much as I've enjoyed all of the *previous* books in the series, this is without doubt the best Sheila Malory mystery to date. Easily worthy of a five star rating.	2002-03-12

That is to say, there has always been a tendency to concentrate on the characters, with the crime element growing out of the interactions of those characters.<br />Nevertheless, the books, numbering ten (up till now) have usually offered a satisfactory read and a reasonable degree of obscurity as to &quot;who dunnit&quot;.<br />In &quot;Lilies that Fester&quot;, however, Mrs Malory - or rather her creator, Ms Holt - seems to have totally lost the plot.<br />In the first place not only the identity of the murderer, but also the motivation, are clear as soon as the main characters have been introduced. Even the author seems to have realised that all was not well, since a majority of the book simply wanders round and round the same marginally interesting bits of story line and does little or nothing to help in the detecting the culprit.<br />Indeed, on the final two pages of Chapter Nineteen, Mrs Malory and her son decide that the only reason for bothering to solve the mystery is so that the son's fiancee will feel like agreeing to a date for their marriage.<br />This feeling that the author has lost all interest in her story is further emphasised in the half-hearted denoument wherein the characters decide not to hand the murderer over to the police, nor even to stop him embezzling a regular £1,000+ per week, apparently for no better reason than ... well, quite frankly for no apparent reason at all!<br />It's a daft ending to a vacuous story, and totally inconsistent with the central character's typically 'conservative' thinking and behaviour as depicted in the previous books in the series.<br />On this showing, it's definitely time for Mrs Malory to hang up her magnifying glass and disappear quietly into the sunset.	2002-03-11

So here, instead, are two snippets which seem to me to sum up the whole spirit and content of this SERIOUSLY OVER-RATED book:<br />On pages 86-88 we are told that we must all be proactive, because being proactive is better than anything. Particularly if your boss is an ignorant tyrant - in which case you should proactively start sucking up to him before anyone else gets in as No. 1 \\"yes\\" man.<br />You should also learn to practise emotional blackmail wherever you can. Treat other people nicely, so that they always \\"owe you one\\", especially your friends and relations (Covey calls this creating an \\"emotional bank account\\"!) (pp.188-202).<br />So, if that's your idea of how a \\"successful\\" person would behave, then this may be the book for you.<BR>If you're aiming for something with rather more integrity, however, then I'd recommend that you avoid this book like the plague.	2002-03-07

All to often discussions of change management tend to concentrate on the people side of things and ignore the less glamerous topics such as re-tooling, revised administrative and reporting procedures and so on.<BR>So, just to keep the record straight, this book is primarily concerned with the personnel aspects of change, with all other aspects of the overall process taking a very secondary part in the proceedings.<br /><br />And now, on with the review:<br /><br />One of the ways I judge a book like this is by the number of highlights I've made (makes it so much easier to refer back to the key points).<BR>Sometimes I'll go through an entire book and be lucky to have half a dozen highlighted passage.<br /><br />NOT here, though.<br /><br />Without a hint of exaggeration I found numerous points worth highlighting in every one of the eight reprinted articles.<br /><br />Of course this is not entirely surprising given the list of contributors, which includes such &quot;leaders of the pack&quot; as John Cotter (&quot;Leading Change&quot;), Richard Pascale and Anthony Athos (&quot;The Reinvention Roller Coaster&quot;), and Jerry Porras (Building Your Company's Vision&quot;).<br /><br />I'd also like to commend the article &quot;Managing Change : The Art of Balancing&quot;, by Jeanie Daniel Duck, (which ended up with highlighting on nearly every page!).<br /><br />So, whilst the material is not exactly new (the various items appeared in the Harvard Business Review between 1992 and 1998), I'd suggest this well-chosen set of articles is as important now as when the articles were first published.	2002-03-07

The subtitle to this book is &quot;Stop Making Excuses!&quot; It should have been: &quot;Boot Camp-style self-development.&quot;<BR>Take this nifty little mental straightjacket that the reader is invited to lace themself into around page 28:<br />Assignment #2: ... I want you to sit down and write a story. The story is entitled: &quot;The Story I'll Tell Myself if I Don't Create Meaningful and Lasting Change After Reading and Studying This Book.<BR>... I suggest that you begin it by writing: &quot;After reading and studying this book, I did not create meaningful and lasting change because ...&quot;<br />In psychology this kind of stuff is known as a 'double bind'.<BR>- If you do what you're told then you are admitting, with literally 90% of the book still unread, that the only way it can't work is if you refuse to let it work.<BR>- If, on the other hand, you turn down the invitation then obviously the book can't be expected to help you, because you've only read 10% of it and already you're refusing to co-operate. <BR>Either way, if the book doesn't revolutionise your life then it's no one's fault but your own!  Neat, huh?<br />Anyway, let's say you march willingly into the boot camp, you may want to unload your thinking abilities at the gate in order to get through the next 254 pages.<br />For example, it will help you to overlook all the nonsense statements, like:<br />&quot;Life Law #7: Life Is Managed; It Is Not Cured&quot; (page 167)<br />What that means, as far as this book is concerned, is that the only way you'll ever get a life is by producing great reams of lists. In fact you'll be asked to create so many lists that you'll need to have to create a set of &quot;summary sheets&quot; just so that you can &quot;see the 'big picture.'&quot;  (You don't get this thrilling bit of news until Chapter 12 - I wonder why?)<br />As to the so-called Life Rule, rightly or wrongly, I had been under the impression that &quot;life is for living&quot; rather burying yourselfunder mountains of paperwork. But hey, what do I know 8)<br />Of course the author does have a rather unique personal philosophy:<br />&quot;I cannot think of a single time in my life where my experience has been enriched or the quality of my life enhanced by my saying 'no'. I can think of dozens of times when my life has been enhanced simply because I said, 'Okay, sure: I'll give it a try.' &quot; (page 81)<br />I guess someone must have spotted what a no brainer that one was, because in the very next paragraph we read:<br />&quot;If someone is saying, 'Hey, try some cocaine; you'll love it,' that's obviously not the time to be a willing spirit.&quot;<br />On other occasions the illogicality of the instructions in the book takes on a life of its own. For example, on page 166 we are told that:<br />&quot;There is no reality; only perception. Let your perceptions be fresh and new and grounded in fact, not in history.&quot;<br />'Scuse me? If there is NO REALITY just where do these facts come from?<BR>And if there is &quot;no reality, only perception&quot;, what sense does this next instruction make (page 234):<br />&quot;Writing it down adds important objectivity to your self-appraisal.&quot;<br />If there &quot;is no reality, only perception&quot; then everything you think must by definition be SUBJECTIVE. So how can writing things down &quot;add ... objectivity&quot;?<br />But the book isn't just off-beam. It is deeply pessimistic. On page 73, for example, the reader is told to:<br />&quot;Honestly evaluate your style of engagement [with other people], and you will begin to understand why the world responds to you as it does. To help you, here are some examples of engagement styles to which the world reciprocates very predictably.&quot;<br />We then get 18 examples - and every single one is negative (pages 73-80).<br />The trouble is, it seems, that the book is not sufficiently informed by modern psychology. Thus on page 50 we find this apparently simple statement:<br />&quot;Having read this list, you may be thinking, 'Boy, this guy is a pessimist about people.' Not true. I'm not a pessimist; I'm a realist.&quot;<br />Actually those two qualities frequently go hand-in-hand. As Martin Seligman observes, in the best-selling &quot;Learned Optimism&quot; (a book which is based on about a quarter of a century of solid scientific research):<br />&quot;Overall, then, there is clear evidence that non-depressed people distort reality in a self-serving direction and depressed people tend to see reality accurately.&quot;<br />And in psychological terms, as Seligman points out, depression is the *real* epidemic sweeping the Western world. Not because someone *thinks* it is - but because there is indisputable clinical evidence to show that it is so.<br />So, if you like being verbally beaten about the head, if you find it comforting to imagine that the whole of life can be reduced to just ten short rules, if you believe in slogans like &quot;No pain, no gain&quot;, you'll certainly like this book.<br />If, on the other hand, you're still in the mood to think for yourself, I'd suggest that you'd be far better off with Maxwell Maltz' &quot;Psycho-Cybernetics&quot; (the original, not the re-write), or if you have problems with depression, Martin Seligman's &quot;Learned Optimism&quot;.	2002-02-19

Books	5	14	18	N	N	Lakin knows what he's talking about	All too often, saying that a book is 'self-published' is the start of a list of faults and errors. BUT NOT THIS TIME. On the contrary, this is the most professional example of self-publishing I have ever come across. Apart from the spiral binding it is the equal of any product of a regular publishing house. And believe me, that is quite an achievement in itself.<br />Moreover, the contents are at least the equally of the quality of the presentation. The book gives clear, succinct explanations and regular, top quality exercises with detailed solutions. It is, in my opinion, a book written by someone who REALLY understands his intended audience, and I'd rate it \\"highly recommended\\" for sales people, especially those with a sketchy or non-existent knowledge of NLP.<br />Although the author also runs \\"Unfair Advantage\\" as a live course, I was satisfied that I was getting a 100 per cent explanation of the material being covered. Indeed, the more I read, the more impressed I was by Duane's ability to deliver a training resource through the medium of the printed word.<br />Of course you've probably noticed the fairly hefty price tag - or is it really so much to pay for a book that is easily the equal of the content of many two or three day training course - which would cost you a whole lot more!<br />In other words, I REALLY DO like this book - and if YOU want to know how to apply NLP in the sales situation, I'd suggest that you make this book, along with Sharon Drew Morgan's \\"Selling with Integrity\\", your very FIRST purchases. It's as simple as that.	2002-02-07

Furthermore, unlike his later later play-to-novel conversion &quot;Spider's Web&quot;, this text reads like a genuine novel, NOT like a hastily edited play script.<br /><br />Of course it isn't a perfect example of a 100% genuine Christie novel.  Christie was a far more talented writer than her later critics like to admit, and therefore not as easily imitated as one might expect.<BR><BR>In this case, the text occasionally becomes a little too heavy-handed, and the plotting isn't as nearly dense or labyrinthine as in an original Christie novel.<br /><br />As to giving the game away, I personally prefer to read this kind of book as an entertainment rather than a MENSA examination, and as such I must confess that the passage in question passed almost unnoticed and in no way spoiled my enjoyment.<br /><br />So &quot;E&quot; for effort to Mr Osborne for this workman-like pastiche.  A &quot;lite&quot; but enjoyable read and well worth the price.	2002-01-05

For some strange reason, considering the excellent job he made of \\"Black Coffee\\", this time he has, most surprisingly, produced an absolute clunker.<br /><br />First and foremost it lacks any effective characterisation.  I got the feeling that I was reading a description of the play by someone who was very competent at remembering the dialogue, but who really wasn't very interested in either the characters or the play itself.<br /><br />The story, such as it is, moves along in a jerky and very obviously contrived manner - the sort of thing you only notice in a live performance if the actors are second rate.<br /><br />My second criticism concerns the plot itself, which might well have been sufficient for a two hour play, but is far too meagre to justify a full-length novelisation.  It is, in fact, a combination of two ideas that appeared elsewhere as short stories - one as a Poirot tale first published in 1923, and one which was subsequently (1979) included in &quot;Miss Marple's Final Cases&quot; .  <br /><br />In short, though the original (1954) play was described as a \\"comedy thriller\\", the novel is entirely bereft of either humour or thrills.  Definitely not worth any kind of recommendation.	2002-01-01

Erickson, M.D.	Books	5	102	104	N	N	Classic Psychology	Anyone who is seriously interested in NLP and/or hypnosis should read this book - over and over again!<br />There are plenty of books that have been described as 'classics' of their genre, though few of them actually deserve that description.  Jay Haley's book is one of the few<br />If I have any complaint at all about this book, it concerns the first 50-odd pages (Chapters 1 and 2) which consist of Haley's efforts to codify the general principles behind the Ericksonian method - and is rather overlong (by any standards) as an introduction.<br />If anyone were to ask my opinion I'd say skip these two chapters when you first read the book.  Then read them afterwards and see what *you* think.<br />In Chapter 3 there is a complete change of pace as Haley very quickly starts to bring in the wealth of Ericksonian material - case descriptions, actual dialogue, etc., which make up the body of book from then on.<br />Chapters 3 - 9 are interestingly set out so as to deal with seven major aspects of adult life - courtship, becoming an adult, marriage, childbirth and dealing with young children, family problems, letting go (when your kids are ready to leave home), and 'the pain of old age'.<br />I found this style of presentation is very effective, and Haley provides plenty of interesting and useful material, including many of the Ericksonian classics: The woman who was too fat to get married, the February Man, the Tomato Plant, the 'Incomplete Handshake' hypnotic induction, and so on and so on.<br />Incidentally, it is important to understand that Erickson ALWAYS worked on the basis of this simple belief:  Every patient already has the resources to deal with their &quot;presenting problem&quot;.  On this basis Erickson did not TELL people what they should do, instead he aimed to help them to find their own solution.<br />In the case of the Prussian gentleman, for example, Erickson believed (correctly) that his apparently physiological problem had a psychological genesis.  After interviewing the man he also came to the conclusion that the man had repressed himself to such an extent that only an emotional outburst would get him &quot;unstuck&quot;.  So Erickson did his best to get the man to lose his temper.  Which he did - and immediately *started* to recover his health.<br />The &quot;cure&quot; may have been unorthodox by some standards, but it worked.  And despite all his very traditional credentials, Erickson was far more interested in facilitating people's return to health than in limiting himself to traditional medicine's view of how a doctor should or should not behave.<br />So why not buy the book, and meet one of the 20th century's most outstanding healers.  Enjoy!	2001-11-23
US	45914225	RY2DLEF655XS5	0916990249	230020537	Changing Belief Systems With NLP	Books	1	38	53	N	N	Illogical levels	<br />Firstly, I have to agree entirely with the previous reviewer who claimed that there isn't much NLP in this book.  Since both Bandler and Grinder insist that NLP is the modelling of excellence - and everything else is just technique, this book is all about technique and very little to do with NLP.  it is, moreover, mainly to do with a technique which, though high in the popularity ratings, actually makes little sense in the form in which it is presented here. <br /><br />The so-called Logical Levels model was developed in the late 1980s, and this *appears* to be its first public appearance in book form.  And a very underwhelming appearance it is.<br /><br />Unlike most of this author's other books, the main text is simply an edited transcript of a training session run by the author somewhere in Europe (Holland?).  And the difference is remarkable.<BR>Instead of the usual pseudo-scientific, dry-as-dust style found in many of his other books, this time Dilts comes to life as a warm, enthusiastic character.  Unfortunately, the actual contents of the presentation do not measure up to the style, and with the best will in the world this book is a far cry from the classic NLP seminar transcripts such as 'Frogs into Princes'.<br /><br />As more and more NLPers are beginning to realise, despite the hype, the Logical Levels model is neither logical, nor anything to do with true &quot;levels&quot; in the sense that Bateson used the term (the Logical Levels model is *supposedly* based on Bateson's &quot;Logical Levels of Learning&quot; model).<br /><br />The basic purpose of the book is apparently to illustrate how the Logical Levels model can be used in therapy to change beliefs.  To do this, the author carries out two interventions which form the core of the text.  Unfortunately what we actually get is a demonstration of how very directive, even dictatorial, some NLP techniques can be (wholly at odds with the 'permissive' style of Milton Erickson - whose work is often cited as one of the original sources NLP was based upon).<br /><br />The final outcome is quite frankly a bit of a pig's ear.  Dilts' explanations for what he's doing, and why he's doing it, vary in clarity from adequate to virtually non-existent.<BR>We get the subject's initial reactions to their experience (a notoriously unreliable measure of the efficacy of this kind of event) and absolutely no follow-up details.<BR>My own impression was that the two subjects were somewhat overawed by the opportunity to work so closely with one of the 'big names' in NLP, and were doing their best to match whatever it was they thought he expected of them.  What I did NOT get was any sense that the sessions had brought about genuine, long term, beneficial changes.<br /><br />Dilts fans may well enjoy this book.  Others may find it a high price to pay for very little useful content.	2001-11-23

Yes. But totally opposite from all *conventional* wisdom. Indeed, check out the review posted on March 29th.<BR> The reviewer asks &quot;would a salesperson armed with only the 'Selling with Integrity' framework be effectively prepared for hardline end-run negotiation tactics from the buyer?&quot; <br />This isn't a good question or a bad question - it is a totally irrelevant question.<BR> Using Ms Morgan's approach correctly will negate the possibility of ending up in that situation in the first place.<BR> And anyway, if, by some chance it does occur, why is it a problem?<BR> If you're desperate to make a sale then of course you have to dive in and go head to head.<BR> If you've understood and adopted Ms Morgan's message, on the other hand, you are in there to provide a service - NOT to make a sale, per se. <br />So, if the buyer tries to change the rules it simply means that you've lost rapport.<BR> If you think it's worth it, re-establish rapport and carry on helping the buyer to find out what s/he really needs; otherwise simply let it go. <br />Ms Morgan also explains why striving to guide the customer back to your own goods is a mistake. It's as simple as this: <br />If you're offering a genuine SERVICE to your customer then you are aiming to provide the most appropriate solution to their needs - regardless of who provides that solution.<BR> If your underlying concern is always to guide the customer to your own products then you are, in essence, still trying to SELL something rather than provide a service. You are still, as in all traditional approaches to the sales process, putting your own needs (to make a sale) before the needs of the customer (to find the BEST solution). <br />Many years ago I worked in retail computer sales.One day I discovered that a certain manufacturer, whose goods we stocked, had a return rate of 25% or more. From that time on I refused to sell any items produced by that manufacturer. And I explained why<BR> Some customers bought a different machine. Others went to another sales person or another shop. <br />My colleagues were initially horrified. How could I turn down cast iron sales opportunities? Before long, however, they changed their tune. <br />Why? Because the number of customers went up by over 50%. Sales went up by even more. Why?<BR> Because word of mouth spread the message that we told the truth about the goods we were selling and gave good advice. We weren't just selling computers, we were providing an honest, reliable SERVICE. <br />By the way, this idea isn't exactly new, though Ms Morgan does present it in a thoroughly professional manner. Check out the film &quot;Miracle on 35th Street&quot;, and you'll see what I mean.<BR> What's new is the realisation that, as a serious, viable approach to selling IT WORKS. <br />Buy the book. Try it out. Be amazed! <br />	2001-08-24

The rest of the NLP-related books, six in all, are grouped under a single heading - &quot;Language&quot;.<br /><br /> What we actually have here is a rather pedestrian description of the various aspects of networking (with people, not computers) including various more or less related items, and a few references to NLP.<BR> And I do mean &quot;few&quot;. Unless you already have a reasonable grasp of the basics of NLP, this book will do very little to change your situation.<BR> This is all the more regrettable given that Ms Harris is described on the back cover as the &quot;Chair of the Association for Neuro-Linguistic Programming&quot;. (Her term of office actually ran out only a month or two after the book was published.)<br /><br />To give you a flavour of the content, check this passage on page 193, where - for no observable reason - the author is trying to identify parallels between NLP and something called Action Profiling (no, I've never heard of it, either):<br /><br />&quot;To summarise, Action Profiling teaches that PMG patterns express the individual's true self, are relatively unchanging in adulthood and have a compulsive nature, in that people express their personality through repeating their PMG patterns. NLP, too, takes this view, that people cannot help representing their inherent behaviour patterns, however hard they try. This means that, in networking, once you become aware of people's patterns, you have a sample of their &quot;true self&quot; and can then act on this information accordingly.&quot;<br /><br />This confused piece of reasoning raises a number of troubling questions:<br /><br />1. Even if this comparison were true - which it isn't - why introduce Action Profiling into a book on NLP and networking?<br /><br />2. What on earth is meant here by &quot;true self&quot; and &quot;inherent behaviour patterns&quot;?  Does the author understand the precise meaning of the word &quot;inherent&quot; ('an essential or permanent attribute')?  And where, in the whole of NLP is there anything that says that each person has some kind of unchanging and unchangeable &quot;true&quot; self?<br /><br />3. If we can &quot;become aware of people's patterns ... a sample of their 'true self' &quot; can we really treat this as something that is &quot;relatively unchanging in adulthod&quot; and then &quot;act on this information accordingly&quot;, apparently as some kind of one-off operation?<br /><br />After all, why, if this were true, would we need to frequently calibrate and recalibrate the people we are communicating with?<BR> Are we merely paying lip-service when we talk about people adopting different meta programs in different contexts?<BR> What happens NLP's key concept of creating and having choices if this &quot;true self&quot; is &quot;relatively unchanging in adulthood&quot;?<BR> How can a major portion of NLP be concerned with change and self-development it we are aren't really open to change in the first place?<br /><br />To be blunt, this is bad psychology and bad NLP.  And if this is a true reflection of the author's best understanding of the subject, no wonder the she can find so little to say about NLP.	2001-08-20

Unfortunately, these were all too obviously NOT the right hands.<br /><br />My first doubts regarding the book were aroused by the cover blurb statement: <br /><br />&quot;For the first time NLP and Training methods are brought together in a well-researched, easy-to-read practical handbook.&quot;<BR> Excuse me? &quot;For the first time...&quot;? I don't think so!<BR> The Effective Delivery... wasn't published until 1997, which leaves it some way behind front runners such as &quot;Training with NLP&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Excellent Trainer&quot; (1996).   <br />I was also unimpressed with the claim that the is &quot;well-researched&quot;?  By whom?  Apart from the sections on learning styles and humour, almost every single one of the references to scientific studies is mirrored in the bibliography of &quot;The Learning Brain&quot; (Eric Jensen, 1994).  Is it pure coincidence that Garratt only acknowledges Jensen as his source in those cases where Jensen himself hasn't given a detailed reference?   <br />Thirdly, I'm also extremely wary of anyone who claims to be concerned about people yet describes employees as HR (Human Resources!).  This is a euphemism born in the same maternity ward as &quot;down-sizing&quot;, &quot;business process re-engineering&quot; and the rest of the jargon of the early 90s designed to make it emotionally easier for managers to announce mass firings, sorry - major redundancy programmes.<br /><br />To be quite blunt, the book seems to be based on the assumption that if you make enough of the &quot;right noises&quot; some of it is bound to make sense. Not exactly of the kind of 'elegant' solution that NLP is intended to produce, and certainly not a very impressive demonstration of the skills the book purports to teach.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, then, the book frequently makes exactly the kind of mistakesthat any experienced and skilled trainer (regardless of their knowledge of NLP) would avoid like the plague. For example: <br /><br /> - The intended audience for the book is never specified<BR>  - NLP jargon is almost always introduced without explanation. Indeed, on one notable occasion the author goes so far as to say, in so many words: 'You won't understand this but I'm going to tell you anyway'!<BR>  - The reader is frequently instructed to do things they obviously cannot do (e.g. an exercise that includes the instruction to &quot;Use all the available NLP techniques...&quot; when not one technique has yet been described)<BR>  - Many of the alleged explanations don't actually explain anything at all unless you already know enough NLP not to need the explanation.<br /><br />As to the way that the book covers specific aspects of NLP:<br /><br /> - There is one brief reference to 'closure', but key skills like nested metaphors/nested loops are never mentioned, let alone explained<BR>  - On the subject of meta programs, 'convincer modes' are only mentioned as an afterthought (described as 'convincer patterns'), and 'convincer channels' aren't mentioned at all!<BR>  - The text regularly features examples of negative re-inforcement such as &quot;This is actually harder than it sounds&quot; ...<BR>   - ... and even the basic skill of framing instructions in the positive (&quot;Do do abc&quot;) rather than the negative (&quot;Don't do xyz&quot;) seems to be a skill too advanced to be included in this book.  etc., etc.<br /><br />One further criticism concerns the incredibly high rate of redundancy in the text.  Apparently working on the basis of &quot;tell them what you're going to tell them; tell them; then tell them what you've told them&quot;, great chunks of the text are repeated both in the so-called &quot;exercises&quot; AND in the chapter summaries.<BR> On an actual training course this approach makes sense. In a book, where the reader can backtrack whenever they want, and as often as they want, this simply means that the basic information accounts for as little as 50% of the total text - if that.<br /><br />So my difficulty in recommending this book can be summed up quite simply: <br /><br />If you are a trainer with little or no previous knowledge of NLP then this book is so poorly presented it is more likely to confuse than enlighten.<BR> And if you already have a reasonable grounding in NLP, this text will tell you nothing you don't already know.<br /><br />In the final analysis, when compared with an alternative, such as O'Connor and Seymour's excellent &quot;Training with NLP&quot; this book comes across as amateurish, and vastly overpriced (even in the cheaper paperback format).	2001-07-15

I want you to sit down and write a story. The story is entitled: \\"The Story I'll Tell Myself if I Don't Create Meaningful and Lasting Change After Reading and Studying This Book.<BR> ... I suggest that you begin it by writing: \\"After reading and studying this book, I did not create meaningful and lasting change because ...\\"<br /><br />In psychology this kind of stuff is known as a `double bind'.<BR> If you do what you're told then you are admitting, with literally 90% of the book still unread, that the only way it can't work is if you refuse to let it work.<BR> If, on the other hand, you turn down the invitation then obviously the book can't be expected to help you, because you've only read 10% of it and already you're refusing to co-operate.  It's still nobody's fault but your own!<br /><br />So, let's say you march willingly into the boot camp, carefully off loading your thinking abilities at the gate. That is going to be a big help over the next 254 pages.<BR> For example, it will help you to overlook all the nonsense statements, like:<br /><br />\\"Life Law #7:  Life Is Managed; It Is Not Cured\\"  (page 167)<br /><br />What that means, in the context of this book, is that it seems the only way you'll ever get a life is by producing great reams of lists. So many lists, in fact, that you're going to have to create a set of \\"summary sheets\\" so that will enable you \\"to see the `big picture.'\\" Now, rightly or wrongly, I had been under the impression that \\"life is for living\\" rather burying yourself under mountains of paperwork.  But hey, what do I know  8)<br /><br />Or how about this for a personal philosophy:<br /><br />\\"I cannot think of a single time in my life where my experience has been enriched or the quality of my life enhanced by my saying 'no'.  I can think of dozens of times when my life has been enhanced simply because I said, 'Okay, sure: I'll give it a try.' &quot; (page 81)<br /><br />I guess someone must have spotted what a no brainer that one was, because in the very next paragraph we read:<br /><br />\\"If someone is saying, 'Hey, try some cocaine; you'll love it,' that's obviously not the time to be a willing spirit.\\"<br /><br />On other occasions the illogicality of the instructions in the book takes on a life of its own.  For example, on page 166 we are told that:<br /><br />\\"There is no reality; only perception.  Let your perceptions be fresh and new and grounded in fact, not in history.\\"<br /><br />'Scuse me?  There is NO REALITY, but your perceptions must be \\"grounded in fact\\"?  What \\"facts\\" are there if there is *no* reality?<BR> And if there is \\"no reality, only perception\\", what sense does this next instruction make (page 234):<br /><br />\\"Writing it down adds important objectivity to your self-appraisal.\\"<br /><br />If there \\"is no reality, only perception\\" then everything you think must by definition be SUBJECTIVE.  So how can writing things down \\"add ... objectivity\\"?<br /><br />But the book isn't just off-beam.  It is deeply pessimistic.  On page 73, for example, the reader is told to:<br /><br />\\"Honestly evaluate your style of engagement [with other people], and you will begin to understand why the world responds to you as it does.  To help you, here are some examples of engagement styles to which the world reciprocates very predictably.\\"<br /><br />We then get 18 examples - and every single one is negative (pages 73-80).<br /><br />The trouble is, it seems, that the book is not sufficiently informed by modern psychology.  Thus on page 50 we find this apparently simple statement:<br /><br />&quot;Having read this list, you may be thinking, 'Boy, this guy is a pessimist about people.'  Not true.  I'm not a pessimist; I'm a realist.&quot;<br /><br />Actually those two qualities frequently go hand-in-hand.  As Martin Seligman observes, in the best-selling \\"Learned Optimism\\"  (a book based on about a quarter of a century of solid scientific research):<br /><br />\\"Overall, then, there is clear evidence that non-depressed people distort reality in a self-serving direction and depressed people tend to see reality accurately.\\"<br /><br />And in psychological terms, as Seligman points out, depression is the *real* epidemic sweeping the Western world.  Not because someone *thinks* it is - but because there is indisputable clinical evidence to show that it is so.<br /><br />In other words, if you like being verbally beaten about the head, if you find it comforting to imagine that the whole of life can be reduced to just ten short rules, if you believe in slogans like \\"No pain, no gain\\", you'll certainly like this book.<BR> If, on the other hand, you're still in the mood to think for yourself, I'd suggest that you'd be far better off with Maxwell Maltz' \\"Psycho-Cybernetics\\" (the original, not the re-write), or for the more scientifically- minded, Martin Seligman's \\"Learned Optimism\\".	2001-06-14

And the attempt to draw parallels between them finally falls apart completely on page 38 when the author goes off into a fantasy about &quot;the brain's central control room&quot;, which has NO physiological counterpart known to man.<br /><br />On Motivation:<BR> We are told (page 92) that motivational speakers are no use because: &quot;... there is a problem with that kind of motivation: *it is external and it does not last*.&quot;<BR> Yet on page 130 the author tells how he created &quot;... an early, somewhat primitive form of &quot;I can do it!&quot; Self-Talk [tape] for a company which wanted a motivational pep-talk cassette their salespeople could listen to when their sales were down.&quot;<BR> He also tells us that his wife lost 25 pounds through (and I quote) &quot;eavesdropping on my cassette tapes!&quot;<br /><br />So if I understand this right, external motivation doesn't work - except when your external motivator is Shad Helmstetter?<br /><br />On Hypnotism:<BR> &quot;[H]ypnosis is not effected during the normal &quot;waking&quot; state.&quot; (page 99)<BR> Absolutely wrong.  At this very moment, as you concentrate on your PC monitor to read these words you are in a light level of hypnosis.  Yet you are fully &quot;awake&quot;, are you not?<br /><br />&quot;Hypnosis requires the subject (you) to enter what is called a &quot;trance&quot; state, one of several levels of consciousness which open doors to the subconscious mind.&quot; (page 99).<BR> This &quot;trance&quot; element, it seems,is apparently &quot;a bad thing&quot; because, &quot;With active, daily Self-Talk, you are consciously in control and in charge of every change you are making within yourself.  With hypnosis you are not.&quot;<br /><br />Oh really?  Well if *you* aren't in charge during self-hypnosis, who is?<BR> Helmstetter never bothers to answer this question, but he does make some rather self-contradictory statements on the subject over the next few pages, thus:<br /><br />&quot;If you use self-hypnosis as a tool for your own growth, and it has worked for you in the past, and if you choose to use Self-Talk as part of that tool, the combination of your own self-hypnosis and your new Self-Talk should work for you as well.&quot; (p.106).<BR> (Does this mean that the author really does understand that you can be both &quot;awake&quot; AND in a light &quot;trance&quot; at the same time?)<br /><br />&quot;Silent Self-Talk can be either a conscious or an unconscious internal dialogue.&quot; (p. 115).<br /><br />&quot;Do your words paint the picture for your own subconscious mind you want it to be hearing?&quot; (p. 120).<br /><br />&quot;Since I first began to recommend that people use cassette tapes as a programming tool for the subconscious...&quot; (p. 132).<br />&quot;Your subconscious mind will be busily programming in the positive new information about you whether you are consciously thinking about it or not.&quot; (p. 134).<br /><br />&quot;This is the Self-Talk that directs your subconscious mind to stop doing something one way and start doing it another.&quot; (pages 150-151).<br /><br />And the piece de resistance: in the &quot;Positive Self-Talk to Stop Smoking&quot; script:<br /><br />&quot;When I see a cigarette, or even think of one, I automatically hear the words, &quot;I do not smoke&quot; - and I don't!&quot; (page 157). <BR> A 'bog standard' example of a 'post hypnotic suggestion' if ever I saw one.<br /><br />In other words, Self-Talk is nothing but communication with your subconscious mind - which is exactly what hypnosis is all about.<BR> The only difference is that when you are consciously bombarding yourself with Self-Talk then your conscious, critical mind is given free rein to sabotage anything it can.<BR> The point of using self-hypnosis is that in a &quot;trance&quot; state you can, to a greater or lesser degree, short circuit that self-defeating critical tendency.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, then, of the five types of Self-&quot;Talk&quot; that the author describes, some are acknowledged to be more effective than others - and the more like overt self-hypnosis they are, the more successful they are likely to be!<br /><br />On the Use of Language:<BR> On page 153, the author rightly points out that phrases that contain the word &quot;should&quot; usually result in non-action, thus:<br /><br />&quot;I *should* cut down on fried apple fritters - BUT I don't.&quot;<br /><br />Yet at the bottom of that same page we find a recommended item of Self-Talk that goes:<br /><br />&quot;I only eat what I should.&quot;<br /><br />Which neatly conceals the underlying  route to failure as in:<br /><br />&quot;I know I *should* eat yoghurt, BUT cheesecake is so much nicer!&quot;<br /><br />Nor does the author appear to understand the effect of negatives in speech.  Thus his &quot;Positive Self-Talk for Freedom From Worry&quot; starts with the phrase &quot;I do not worry&quot; and ends with &quot;I never worry&quot;.<br /><br />Now, what do you have to think about in order to make sense of these two phrases?  You have to think about WORRYING.  So the script that will allegedly free us from Worry actually starts and ends by reminding us about WORRY.<BR> Oops!<br /><br />In the final analysis there are some parts which - as typical examples of self-hypnosis - will undoubtedly be of use, and it comes as no surprise that many reviewers see this as having been a great help to them.<br /><br />Having said that, however, once we admit that this book really only covers a limited area of hypnosis/self hypnosis, the question becomes, &quot;Why be satisfied with something that is limited and incomplete?&quot;<BR> Why not just buy a book that says outright what it's about and tells the whole story.	2001-05-16

It's author died in 1975.  And to be quite honest, the age of the book sometimes shows through in the author's style of writing and in some of his basic ideas (no, human beings are NOT highly sophisticated servo-mechanisms, nor is the human brain some kind of super computer).<br /><br />Leaving these basic misconceptions aside, however, this is still one of the best books of its kind that you're going to find (though I understand that, after more than 40 years as `king of the hill', it may at last be about to face some real competition).<br /> This is all the more amazing given that the author didn't even have a basic qualification in psychology.  On the contrary, he was a plastic surgeon.  Yet there is more genuine insight in this book than in many of the later works on Cognitive Therapy, etc., by high powered Ph.Ds.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is absolutely the last word on the subject.  There are, for example, several places where the author has touched upon some really crucial piece of information and then passed on, apparently without fully understanding the importance of what he was writing about.<br /> In the case of agression, for example, in Maltz' day `catharsis' (acting out frustration, aggression, etc.) was all the rage and he tells us that:<br /><br />\\"All types of physical exercise are excellent for draining off aggression. ... Especially good are those games where you hit or smash something ...\\"<br /><br />Nowadays we understand that this approach is more likely to breed future aggression than to provide genuine relief.  To be fair to Maltz, however, despite all his comments on providing release valves for the RELIEF of frustration and agression, he does, in passing, (pages 135-6) indicate the far more beneficial method for AVOIDING the kind of thinking that leads to aggression in the first place.<br /><br />Yet despite whatever flaws the book may have, it is still streets ahead of most of it's rivals.

Having said which, the pages are only about two-thirds the size of a regular paperback - so the book still isn't quite as large as it might seem.<br /><br />And now for the other news.  Namely, the whole book appears to be the author's personal view of Zen.  Which wouldn't be a problem except that the author seems to have a totally sanitised, pre-packed for the American market, view of Zen.<br /><br />In practice this means that, for example, pages 3 through 36, illustrate a seemingly continuous process of Dharma transmission and succession from Mahayana Buddhism, through Ch'an to Zen.<BR> In historical reality, so far as we now know it, there is no such line, or even lines, of continuous transmission and development.  Rather Ch'an Buddhism, and therefore Zen Buddhism, seriously lost its way after the death of Hui-neng (638-713).<BR> I have no doubt that the author offers his version of Zen history in all good faith, but the fact is that the politiking of one of Hui-neng's students, a certain Shen-hui, brought about a dualism within the body of Ch'an/Zen teaching from which it has never recovered.<BR> Its perpetuation through to the present day is demonstrated by the existance of, and competition between, Rinzai and Soto Zen.<br /><br />As demonstrated by the heavy emphasis on historical considerations, this is a fairly academic, even sterile, description of Zen. (There are another 6 pages on the more recent history of Zen, plus 10 pages of &quot;Time Lines&quot; - in plain English that's: charts of supposed lines of succession.)<BR> So approximately one quarter of the entire book is given over to the history of Zen. But what is it there for?  Do we need to know this stuff in so much detail (even if it were accurate) in a book subtitled &quot;A Guide to Living Moment by Moment&quot;?  I think not.<BR> On the contrary, all it said tome was that the author is far more interested in parading his intellectual prowess than in delivering a real understanding of what Zen Buddhism is all about.<br /><br />In short, this is a &quot;strictly for the tourists&quot;-type book.  If all you want is a superficial &quot;bluff your way in Zen&quot; sort of introduction to the subject then I guess this may prove to be a sufficiently short read at an appropriately low price.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you want to acquire any kind of genuine understanding of Zen then this is definitely NOT for you.	2001-05-06

Which is kind of strange, given that that when he compiled this collection (and at least 2 others) Godfrey was listed as:<br /><br />&quot;... former editor-in-chief of *Mystery* magazine and a regular columnist for *The Armchair Detective*.&quot;<br /><br />Despite these apparently substantial credentials (I've actually never heard of either of these magazines, but then I don't read many magazines), Mr Godfrey's selection of tidbits from the vast canon of English (note &quot;English&quot;) Country House Murders is truly eccentric.<br /><br />In the first place, his introduction goes at great length into the necessary qualifications for &quot;the English Country House Mystery&quot; - rather than *murders*.<BR> If he'd stopped right there I'd have been beating the drum on his behalf.  But he doesn't.  On the contrary, he seems to fancy himself as the new Haycraft, because he starts in on a list of 14 qualities needed to justify a story as belonging in this category.  The fourteenth quality, by the way, (how to identify &quot;a proper English Country House&quot;) is subdivided into no less than a further 11 conditions!<br /><br />Wow, this guy must really know his stuff.<BR> Right?<BR> Actually, that seems to be in some doubt.<br /><br />The very first point Mr Godfrey makes is that &quot;Authentic English Country House Mysteries are written by authentic English writers. Americans, even Canadians, may study the form and give it a go, but they invariably give themselves away as pretenders to the tradition.&quot;<br /><br />Well - it's 'Godfrey's rule' - so why on earth does he insist on breaking it?<BR> There's a story by Baroness Orczy (Hungarian), one by Dame Ngaio Marsh (New Zealander), and one by John Dickson Carr (born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania!).  To be honest the first two don't accord with Godfrey's rule anyway, but Dickson Carr's story could just as easily be set in Palm Springs, California and all you'd have to do would be change the place names to give it the note of authenticity.<BR> It's a great story, but typical English Country House it is NOT.<br /><br />There are several other criticisms - some stories don't feature murders, some don't take place in a English Country House - as defined by Godfrey's rules - but my main beef is that all of these criticisms could have been easily avoided by a more judicious selection of stories.<br /><br />For example, why do we get nearly 70 pages of a tedious Wilkie Collins story (no murder and precious little country house) - yet not a whiff of Ernest Bramah's blind detective, Max Carrados, nor H.C. Bailey's Mr Fortune?<BR> Why Gideon Fell, but no hint of Edgar Wallace's epitome of understated Englishness - Mr J.G. Reeder?<BR> Why the hysteria-ridden offering from Ethel Lina White (with little or no hint of the brilliance of her full-length works) but not a glimpse of a true 'gem' such as an item featuring Max Pemberton's Bernard Sutton (jeweller) as featured in &quot;Jewel Mysteries I have Known&quot;?<br /><br />All too often anthologies abound in stories that are actually still available from other sources (in this case those by Conan Doyle, Christie, Allingham, Marsh, Rendell, James, etc. all fall into that category), yet fail to feature stories that truly deserve to be anthologised because, though famous in their day, they are now relatively unknown and hard to come by?<br /><br />Of course there must be some big names in there to help sell the book, but Godfrey, IMO, shows far too little instinct for digging out true gems by less well-known authors.<BR> And just in case anyone thinks it can't be done - check back to the greatest series of them all, in this particular context - the mould-breaking 'Rivals of Sherlock Holmes', 'More Rivels...', etc., all neatly topped off by Michele Slingsby's 'Murder on Her Mind'.<br /><br />Ah, now those were the days when anthologisers REALLY knew their business!<br /><br />So yes, you WILL get value for money.

Now I've read it through I feel that 2.5 stars would be more appropriate, but rounded up rather than down.<br /><br />So why the change of mind?<BR> Basically because I feel that the author has divided his attention between two quite separate targets - and in consequence doesn't really score an \\"inner\\" on either of them.<br /><br />My initial reaction was based on two points:<BR> Firstly I didn't spot this immediately as a book on cognitive therapy, and<BR> Secondly, as a sometime hypno/psychotherapist myself I thoroughly enjoyed Seligman's description of how he overcame the champions of behaviourism and sold his own discoveries on 'learned helplessness' to the psychological/psychiatric/mental health establishments.<br /><br />It must be said, however, that apart from three self-tests, this description takes up the first 208 pages of a book where the main text only runs to 296 pages (including the introduction).<BR> For those interested in the experimental validation of the theory, this amount of detail is, I guess, entirely justified.<BR> On the other hand, given that the book's subtitle is \\"How to Change Your Mind and Your Life\\", it seems rather unsatisfactory that the \\"How to\\" section only constitutes less than 30% of the text - and even then, Chapters 12, 13 and 14 (about 74 pages) are essentially three versions of the same information.<br /><br />I was also less than impressed by the fact that, although the current (1998) edition has an updated Introduction, there are several places in the text where no attempt has been made to update information on crucial experiments from the original (1990) edition - see the study of cancer patients (page 184), for example, or the East Berlin/West Berlin comparison (page 202) where a footnote offers this teaser:<br /><br />\\"As I edit this manuscript (April 1990), I find myself wondering to what extent the explanatory style of the East Germans over the last few momentous has changed.\\"<br /><br />And so, I suspect, do your readers, Dr Seligman!<br /><br />As a history of the development of one portion of the cognitive therapy movement, for those readers interested in the subject, I would up my rating to *at least* 4 stars....<BR>	2001-04-19

I mean, has the author really 'walked the walk'?  or is s/he just spinning a good tale?<BR> In the case of Martin Roberts I can, with confidence, assure you that you're getting the gen-u-wine article.  And I know that because one of my own business colleagues - whose opinions I value and trust - worked with Martin for a number of years, and assures me that he really has done what he claims to have done in terms of introducing NLP techniques into high-powered, high profile change programmes.<br /><br />Having said that, I must admit that I found the book top be something of a 'curate's egg'.<br /><br />With NLP being something like 25 years old, it's getting increasingly difficult for authors to find just the right balance when writing about NLP.  Especially when they're writing about NLP and some other major topic.<BR> Do you try and give 'equal time' to both subjects?  Do you assume that your readers will already have a basic grounding in NLP so that you don't need to go over the basics yet again?  Or do you assume nothing and try to work in a succinct overview of NLP for the benefit of those readers who are coming to it for the first time?<br /><br />I'm not going to say that Martin has cracked the problem in this book.  But I've seen a LOT worse.<br /><br />So, what we get is essentially a book in three parts.<BR> Part 1 - the first five chapters - is both an introction to change management *and* a fairly basic overview of some relevant NLP techniques.<BR> Part 2 - chapters 6 - 8 inclusive signals a distinct change of gear as the author launches into an excellently written description of the change management process which clearly demonstrates the author's enthusiasm for the subject, even though he has now moved on to be a very successful publisher.<BR> In Part 3 - the rest of the book - Martin undertakes the tricky job of weaving these two strands together.  And with considerable success, I'd say.<br />So, whilst I'm happy to recommend the book with some enthusiasm, I think it has to be with the qualification that readers will probably get the greatest benefit from the book if they already know the basics of NLP.  On this score I'd recommend &quot;Develop Your NLP Skills&quot; (see... for a short  and comprehensive overview, or &quot;Managing with the Power of NLP&quot; for a rather longer introduction.<BR><br /><br />With that prior knowledge already on hand, you may find that you can pretty much skim the first five chapters.<BR> So have you wasted your money?  No way!  The material in the rest of the book is still more than worth the cover price [even without a discount 8¬) ]	2001-04-12

Lewis and Williams - is quoted on the back cover as saying:<br /><br />&quot;Charles Williams's firm conviction that the spiritual world is not simply a reality parallel with that of the material one, but is rather its source and its abiding infrastructure, is explicit in both the manner and matter of all he wrote.&quot;<br /><br />Well, I haven't read *all* that Williams ever wrote, but I'd say it was most certainly true of this novel, where this interlacing and interaction is an integral part of the plot.<br /><br />Indeed, far from being a mere examination of &quot;the distinction between magic and religion&quot; (back cover of the book), if you want to look for deeper meanings, the story line holds up well as an allegory of the state of all mankind - those who build, and those who destroy; those who believe, those who only *think* they believe, and those who believe they have no belief; and so on and so on.<br /><br />As to the apparently antisemitic element in the story, two things are relevant:<BR> Firstly, it was very common in the Britain of the 1930s for the middle and upper classes to regard Jews with a certain amount of disdain.  But this was not 'antisemitism' as such.  Rather there was a distrust of Levanters (Lebanese, Syrians, Jews/Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, Turks and Greeks) in general which persisted at least into the 1950s.<BR> Secondly, in the passage referred to in a previous review:<br /><br />&quot;They build and we destroy....One day we shall destroy the world.&quot; <br /><br />The speaker, a character called Manasseh, who is initially introduced into the story as simply &quot;a Jew&quot;, is using the word &quot;we&quot; in relation to Satanists, not Jews.<BR> So 'zenophobia', perhaps, but 'antisemitism', I think probably not.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you haven't yet read the book, or you're planning to read it again, you might be interested in the significance of the name &quot;John&quot;, as used in the novel:<br /><br />1. &quot;John&quot;, from the Hebrew &quot;Jochanan&quot; means &quot;God is gracious&quot;<br /><br />2. The book &quot;The Ascent of Mount Carmel&quot;, referred to in the story, on the face of it for no apparent reason, is a real book, a mystical work written by St. John of the Cross.<br /><br />3. Prester John was, in legend, apparently immortal.  In the 12th century he was referred to as the Christian Emperor of Asia. Marco Polo (13th-14th centuries) wrote about him as the lord of the Tartars.  In the 14th century he had allegedly become the Emperor of Abyssinia and was still said to hold that office a century later.	2001-04-08

If you just remove the four brackets then you have first Corinthians, Chapter 13, verses 4-7 from the King James (1611) translation of the Bible. <br /><br />Which is rather strange, really, because according to information from the &quot;Ask Gramps&quot; column written by Mormon member H. Clay Gorton: <br /><br />&quot;All the witnesses [to the translation of the BOM], directly or indirectly, provide strong evidence that Joseph Smith did not use a King James Bible.&quot; <br /><br />The whole subject of the alleged translation of the Book of Mormon is riddled with this kind of inconsistency, starting with the gold plates that were supposedly buried in the hill called Cumorah, near Manchester, New York, in 420 A.D., just over fourteen hundred years before Smith allegedly found them in 1823.<BR> According to David Whitmer, one of the three witnesses to the authenticity of the BOM, Smith: <br /><br />&quot;... did not use the plates in the translation, but would hold the interpreters to his eyes and cover his face with a hat, excluding all light, and before his eyes would appear what seemed to be parchment, on which would appear the characters of the plates in the line at the top, and immediately below would appear the translation, in English, which Smith would read to his scribe, whowrote it down exactly as it fell from his lips. The scribe would then read the sentence written, and if any mistake had been made, the characters would remain visible to Smith until corrected, when they faded from sight to be replaced by another line.&quot; <br /><br />So if Smith didn't need the plates in order to translate them, what was the point of showing them to him in the first place?<BR> Why, having been shown the plates, did Smith see &quot;what seemed to be parchment&quot; during the translation?<BR> Why was the text on the plates in &quot;reformed *Egyptian* hieroglyphics&quot; if it was written by one-time *Israelites* living in America?<BR> Why, if it is genuine, has no-one else ever found a single example of this form of writing, not even in America, Egypt or Israel?<BR> Why, if Smith was able to read Egyptian hieroglyphics at all, did he make such a hash of &quot;translating&quot; the manuscript he named the &quot;Book of Moses&quot;?  (See &quot;By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus: A New Look at the Joseph Smith Papyri&quot; by Charles M. Larson)<BR> And why was Smith given a translation in 17th century English, which surely bore no relation to either the language of America in the 1820's or to the language of the original authors? <br /><br />It is also hard to understand why, even with that seemingly &quot;absolute&quot; quality control, well over 3,000 changes have been made to the text since it was first published.<BR> And it *still* contains errors such as this &quot;prophecy&quot; concerning the birth of Christ: <br /><br />&quot;... he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers ...&quot;<BR> (Alma 7:10) <br /><br />(It need hardly be said that Jesus was born in Bethlehem rather than Jerusalem, and that Jerusalem itself is a city, not a &quot;land&quot;.) <br /><br />The truth of the matter is that this is not a &quot;divinely inspired&quot; work at all, but a (...) version of an earlier novel called &quot;The ManuscriptFound&quot;, by one Solomon Spaulding, (not to be confused with another of Spaulding's works - &quot;The Manuscript Story&quot; - which has nothing to do with the BOM). <br /><br />So, if you enjoy badly written adventures in a poor imitation of the language of the King James Bible, you may well enjoy the Book of Mormon.<BR> If you don't, you won't.<br /><br />Just one last point  - it has been asked &quot;If the book has been the backbone of a religion for over 100 years and yet it was a scam, would it have gone uncovered for so long and would so many people have believed it to be true?&quot;<BR> On the face of it, these are perfectly good questions, which have been asked numerous times by people on both sides of the discussion.  The answers are:<br /><br />Firstly, the question of the authenticity of the BOM is nothing new, on the contrary, it has been in doubt ever since the book was first published.<BR> Secondly, there are far more people around the world who believe in flying saucers than have even heard of the BOM - but that doesn't., of itself, mean that flying saucers actually exist, does it.	2001-04-04

And not only because he himself described his seven novels as &quot;metaphysical thrillers&quot;.<br /><br />Unlike &quot;Descent into Hell&quot; - which is quite frankly an overwrought gothic monstrosity - &quot;Many Dimensions&quot; is a 'typical' Williams story, with standard English prose (standard for the 1930s, that is), a straightforward plotline and plenty of pace.  In fact you could put &quot;Many Dimensions&quot; up against later fiction of a similar tone - like Dennis Wheatley, for example (not very well-known now, but immensely popular in the 50s and 60s) - and be hard put to pick a winner.<br /><br />So where does the philosophy come in?<BR> Primarily in the form of a series of very basic, but also very important, questions that lie just below the surface of the story - and sometimes not even below the surface.<br /><br />Questions like: &quot;If you can restore all of the people in group A to health, but in the process throw at least an equal number of people in group B out of work - at a time when work isn't that easy to come by in the first place - which group should take priority?&quot;<br /><br />This question, and others closely related, run all through the story yet, due to Williams' writing skill, they do nothing to impede the plot unless the reader actively chooses to think them through.<br /><br />The final answer Williams gives, I *think*, is that there is no *easy* answer. Only he frames his conclusion far more lucid and impactful manner than that last observation might suggest.<br /><br />In short, this writing has the power to enthrall and satisfy a wide range of readers.<BR> The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the literary style is typical of British writing in the 1930s, which I guess won't necessarily be to everyone's taste.<BR> Having said which, I really do recommend the majority of Williams' novels as a taste worth acquiring.<br /><br />Oh yes, why did I give this review the title &quot;Does God Play Dice?&quot;? When you read the book I think you'll know exactly why.<BR> Good reading!	2001-04-02

Far from being his &quot;finest novel&quot; (see above) or &quot;The key to Williams's mystically oriented theological thought&quot; (back cover) this is arguably a complete aberration.<br /><br />Whilst the book does indeed revolve around several plot lines, the label &quot;multidimensional story&quot; (back cover) sounds far more meaningful than anything the book actually delivers.<br /><br />The main problem is that there really is no central plot of any substance.  Instead we get several sub plots, none of which amounts to very much, some of which are highly suspect (from the traditional Christian viewpoint), cardboard cut-outs instead of characters, and no very clear resolutions.<br /><br />The fact that Williams liberally coats this hodge-podge with a glutinous literary style (quite unlike the straight forward narratives in his other novels) leads me wonder whether it was us or himself he was trying to delude into thinking that this was a story worth reading/writing.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the story features a verse play by one Peter Stanhope, resident of Battle Hill.  The play is to be performed by various residents of Battle Hill, including Pauline (whose distant ancestor was burned at the stake somewhere on Battle Hill (before it become a middle class housing estate) and who unaccountably fears meeting her doppelganger in the street), and Adela, who is a 1930s version of a bimbo.<br /><br />There is an impoverished labourer who commits suicide on the site when the estate is being built, and who is condemned to wander in and out of the story at odd intervals, for no apparent purpose, and Lawrence Wentworth (an historian of indeterminate status) who rather fancies Adela, but settles for a succubus instead.<br /> The only other characters of any note are Pauline's  terminally old relation, Mrs Anstruther (a model of unassuming saintliness), and Mrs Sammile, who is apparently the mythical first wife of Adam: Lilith - though whether she is a re-incarnation or merely immortal I couldn't tell.<br /><br />Peter Stanhope is used to propound what some critics regard as the raison d'etre for the book - the notion of &quot;substituted love&quot;.<br /> Unfortunately this doctrine is both psychologically and religiously unsound.  It leads Pauline (the recipient of the &quot;substituted love&quot; from Stanhope) to hallucinate that she can do the same thing for her martyred ancestor by removing his fear of being burnt, as well as to the conclusion that we can be baptised on behalf of the dead in order to ensure their salvation - a doctrine expressly rejected in the New Testament.<br /><br />In short, this is, quite unlike Williams' other &quot;metaphysical thrillers&quot;, a highly unsatisfactory 'lemon', or, as Shakespeare put it in Macbeth:<br /><br />&quot;it is a tale ... full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&quot;<br /><br />(Though NOT, in all fairness, &quot;told by an idiot&quot;.)	2001-04-01

Not surprising, really, since the text is an edited version of several seminars Bandler conducted in 1982.<br /><br />It seems to me that you can treat the book as an educational exercise, or as an interactive experience. Indeed, the editing is so effective that I could imagine myself strolling through town letting Bandler show me the world through his eyes, listen to it with his ears, and so on. And a mightily enjoyable experience it was.<br /><br />At the surface level the book covers topics such as submodalities, learning, the &quot;swish&quot; pattern, etc. - keeping in mind how much of our experience is objective, and how much is subjective. Better yet, having pointed out that the majority of our experience subjective - it goes on to explain how we can radically change our lives for the better by &quot;reprogramming&quot; the bits we don't like.<br /><br />Personally I found this to be an excellent book on the subject, with plenty of amusing and relevant cartoons by Gustav Russ Youngreen, and practical exercises and demonstrations throughout.<br /><br />With regard to the difficulties mentioned by other reviewers, I would say that there are plenty of guys doing what Abby describes who wouldn't know NLP from a hole in the ground.<BR> It is also worth pointing out that NLP is, after all, just another tool. And like any other tool, *some* people are bound to misuse it. <br /><br />As for whether you can become proficient in NLP just by attending one or two trainings and reading some books, I agree - you can't.<BR> And if you tell yourself that you don't understand, then you won't (that, too, is &quot;reprogramming&quot;!)<br /><br />Like any other subject, you will only &quot;learn&quot; NLP when you &quot;do&quot; it.  So anyone who thinks that reading this book, or any other,  will make them into a master communicator overnight would probably be better off saving their money.<br /><br />For readers who take the book in the spirit in which it was written, on the other hand, I'd guess you may find this a very enjoyable and beneficial addition to your bookshelf.	2001-03-27

Not surprisingly, then, that has meant that NLP has changed very little over the last couple of decades.

Horror!	<br />A dangerous myth has grown up over the last hundred years or so that only scientists have *real* intelligence and knowledge - because the rest of us are just too thick to understand anything more complicated than a TV remote control.<br /><br />Dangerous, because *some* scientists have used this myth to support a second myth - that they should be allowed to do just about anything they like: Because they are scientists, and the rest of us are too ignorant and stupid to understand how essential this right is.<br /><br />Dangerous, also, because it is used to divert all criticism on the grounds that no-one else is smart enough or sufficiently unbiased to offer valid criticism of anything that &quot;scientists&quot; do.<BR> Like the review from earlier this year, where Milton is accused of being a &quot;stealth creationist&quot; (what, he's big, and virtually invisible to radar?) because he dares to look at evidence that conflicts with traditional evolutionist dogma.<br /><br />Well, Milton isn't *any* kind of creationist.  He's a qualified electrical engineer and a science writer of over 20 years standing.  And I mean a *mainstream* scienctific journalist.<br /><br />Part of what he is doing in this book is bring us back to the simple recognition that science is a useful *part* of modern life - but not the be all and end all.<BR> To this end he presents us with numerous examples of situations where the &quot;establishment&quot;, far from pushing the boundaries of science, has fought tooth and nail to repress anything that threatens the status quo.<br /><br />Like the Johns Hopkins professor who produced mathematics which proved, beyond doubt, that man-powered flight was impossible - just a week or two before the Wright brothers conducted their first flight.<BR> Like the English scientist who described Edison's attempts to produce a light bulb as a waste of time.<BR> Etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />But what probably annoys the &quot;scientists&quot; most is Milton's suggestion that it is seldom if ever the scientific establishment which produces new discoveries. On the contrary, Milton indicates, the mainstream scientists, professors, etc. are far too busy hanging on to their positions and power to ever risk rocking the boat.<br /><br />Thus it was Darwin, a strictly amateur naturalist, who produced the evolutionary hypothesis; it was the Odone's who, against all the medical &quot;knowledge&quot; of the time, produced &quot;Lorenzo's Oil&quot; for the relief of their son's adrenoleukodystrophy (ADD); and so on and so on.<br /><br />The overwhelming message I got from this book had nothing to do with belittling science.  On the contrary, I thought it was an encouragement to see scientists as human beings, with human strengths - as well as human weaknesses.<br /><br />On one side this may be interpreted as a warning to beware of scientists' very human shortcomings.<BR> I prefer to see it as a collection of examples of how progress has occurred, despite all odds - an encouragement to every maverick to push even harder at the boundaries of 'conventional' wisdom.<br /><br />How sad it will be if we ever come to a time when we feel that we do not have the right to ask certain questions just because *some* scientists don't like them.	2001-03-21

It's therefore a good idea to read &quot;Using Your Brain...&quot; before coming to this one so that you get the full benefit of the plot, so to speak.<br /><br />Having said that, whilst the Andreas' willingly acknowledge their indebtedness to Bandler, this is very much their own book.<br /><br />It includes plenty of information on subjects such as Timelines, the Swish pattern, eliciting criteria and submodalities - stuff that was relatively new and novel when it was first published, in 1987, but how does it look fourteen years later?<BR> In my opinion it is still pretty relevant, and I'd expect that will have something to offer all but the most experienced NLPers, either in the sections on &quot;life skills&quot; or on the more directly therapy-oriented sections that deal with compulsions, destructive behaviour, etc.<br /><br />One word of caution: This book is *not* presented in the same chatty style that characterises many of the Andreas' other books (including &quot;Using Your Brain ...&quot;).  The authors explain the reason thus:<br /><br />This book is more technological than most, because we know that detailed technology gets results, and that the &quot;coldest&quot; technology can be delivered with humanity and respect.<br /><br />Ummmmm, yes, I guess so. I certainly wouldn't let this put me off buying the book.	2001-03-19

The three founders of the Brief Therapy unit at Palo Alto (Watzlawick, Weakland and Fisch) had brought out &quot;Change&quot;, which also covers reframing in some detail, back in 1972, for example.<br /><br />But the value of the B&amp;G book is not to be measured by how well it tallies with earlier works.  It's importance lies, I suggest, in what it tells us about how NLP developed as it did.<br /><br />As you can see from earler reviews, the idea of &quot;parts&quot; (partly! derived from Virginia Satir's &quot;parts parties&quot;) is not to everyone's taste.<BR> Joseph Riggio, a well respected NLP trainer, suggests that this approach can produce &quot;fractionation and fragmentation&quot;.  Yet there are lots of people who find that dealing with &quot;parts&quot; fits very well with their view of the world.<BR> And after all, NLP is first and foremost about what works *for you*.<br /><br />Over the last few years it has become clear that there is no such thing as &quot;bog standard NLP&quot;.  Everyone who gets involved will have their own ideas, views, techniques and methods.<br /><br />My advice would be that this book is just one of several key texts that trace the history of NLP.  Whether or not, in the end, you decide that the ideas herein are suitable for you, I think this book will inevitably help you to gain a greater understanding of what lies at the heart of NLP.	2001-03-19

John Thomas Scopes (Galaxy Book; 416)	Books	1	7	19	N	N	When scholarship bows to prejudice	Given that it is allegedly a scholarly review of the Scopes Trial of 1925, and its background, this book falls flat on its face in almost every respect.<br />In the first place, although it does indeed present us with the basic facts, they are so heavily fortified with what I imagine must be the author's own prejudices that the book is virtually useless as a serious historical record.<BR> What exactly was it about William Jennings Bryan, I wonder, that drew such frequent and vicious attacks from this writer? <br />In the second place the author's research appears to be seriously inadequate. Compare this book with Prof. Edward Larson's brilliant study of the same material (\\"Summer for the Gods\\") - which includes close on 40 pages of notes and references - and \\"Six Days...\\" looks more like a sophomore's essay than the work of a professor of history.<br />And thirdly, because he was not content to simply record the facts, Ginger's work is now deeply scarred by the ignorance that still prevailed in the late 50's.<br />For example, though Ginger was indeed a professor of history, not geology, biology or any other of the sciences, he works hard to show how valuable the expert testimony of the defense witnesses would have been, had it been allowed. Yet it is those same aspects of the evidence which Ginger so staunchly defends which are now recognised as being totally useless, or worse, from a scientific stand point... <br />Or again, Ginger reminds us, with not a hint of doubt or qualification, that the \\"gill slits\\" seen in human embryos are a sign of our \\"aquatic ancestry\\". What we now know is that they aren't \\"gill slits\\" at all, but the rudimentary version of what develops into the middle ear, the parathyroid and the Thymus gland.<br />And the rout goes on. Ginger tells us about the significance of the numerous so-called \\"vestigial structures\\" (down from 180 in 1925 to less than half-a-dozen today); of crucial the evidence provided by homology (shown by microbiologist Michael Denton to be quite useless as evidence of evolution); and so on and so on....	2001-03-07

Unfortunately the validity of that earlier work was seriously undermined by Ginger's very obvious bias, especially against William Jennings Bryan.<br /><br />Larson's book suffers from no such flaws, as far as I can tell, treating both defense and prosecution in a thoroughly even-handed fashion.  Having said that, Larson does uncover the truth about several myths surrounding the trial - such as the &quot;real&quot; reason why the defense experts only gave their evidence in the form of affadavits.<BR> (It wasn't as simple as the Judge refusing to allow expert testimony.)<br /><br />There's much, much more I could say in praise of this book, but it all boils down to this:<BR> If you have any interest whatever in the Scopes Monkey Trial, you won't find a better book on the subject than this.	2001-03-06

And who drew the blind man's version of and Escher-type structure?<BR> Who ever it was, and why ever they did it, they certainly added nothing of any value to this book - which really needs all the help it can get.<br /><br />A basic introduction to NLP this most definitely is not.<BR> Presumably because there are already so many books of this kind on the market, the author has tried to add some uniqueness to his text by framing the whole book as ten one day courses delivered to a group of senior executives of the hypothetical Whizzitts Ltd.  (The company makes, surprise, surprise, 'whizzitts' - though we never discover what whizzetts are (high speed widgets, perhaps?)).<br /><br />Its an interesting idea, and it throws up some useful possibilities for readers who plan to train others in NLP skills.  As a standalone DIY book for managers, however, regardless of whether they have any prior knowledge of NLP, even 2 stars is verging on hysterical overgenerosity.<br /><br />The author has what I would describe as a delightfully &quot;English eccentric&quot; style.  Unfortunately, whilst this makes the text very readable, it is not a style well-suited to clear explanation.  At one point, for example, the author introduces a two page handout on John McWhirter's &quot;Basic Fractal Language Model&quot; which he then 'explains' in less than one full page of text.  The description of 'anchoring', on the other hand, goes on for several pages yet never explains exactly how to set an anchor; indeed, it doesn't even say when an anchor should be set or released.<br /><br />In short, a quaint oddity But with very lttle to recommend it in comparison to long established favourites...	2001-02-22

Firstly because 'Hypnosis' manages to cover so much material in a relatively small space - yet without seeming to miss anything of importance.  Secondly, because it teaches by demonstrating three different approaches rather than just the one.<br /><br />When I started out working with hypnosis it was very much in the Estabrooks &quot;You are going to sleep ... you are going into a deep sleep&quot; style.<BR> Since discovering the Ericksonian style, some ten years ago, I've found the experience is much more 'harmonious' (for want of a better word) both for myself and for my clients.  I believe I am also more effective before.<BR> What this book did *for me* was both extend my knowledge and help me to understand why I personally prefer working in the Ericksonian style.<br /><br />Having said that, the book has also given me a better appreciation of the benefits of other styles of hypnosis.  So, whilst I thought I detected a slight, but undeniable bias towards the Ericksonian approach, I believe that the book is sufficiently even-handed to be of interest and value to readers coming from almost *any* other form of hypnotherapy.	2001-02-20

Erickson	Books	5	204	211	N	N	Learning was never so easy - before	<br />Taken at face value this book consists of nothing more than a few anecdotes drawn from Milton Erickson's long and distinguished career as a hypnotherapist and teacher.  Plus a commentary from Sidney Rosen, the editor and also an experienced and well-respected hypnotherapist in his own right.<br /><br />But Milton Erickson is renowned for have developed to a fine art the use of &quot;vague language&quot; and &quot;conversational hypnosis&quot;.  Which is another way of saying that he was a master of the skill of using words to bring his clients to whatever realisations they needed in order to be able to help themselves.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, then, Erickson used those same skills when it came to teaching other doctors, psychiatrists, etc. to use the skills he had so carefully developed.<BR> So whilst these appear to be descriptions of stories that therapists might tell to their clients, they are actually effective 'as YOU read them'.<BR> Thus every reader gets teaching and therapy all in one!<br /><br />This is possibly one of the most seemingly innocent, yet magnificently powerful books I have ever come across.<BR> So get a copy, and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.	2001-02-20

It was probably only a well-meaning apology for having abandoned me in order to be free to go to Hollywood.&quot;<br /><br />In order to get this book in perspective you need to take full note of the subtitle - &quot;radical television and film in the 1960s&quot;.<BR> An even more accurate subtitle would have been &quot;Ian Rakoff, an autobiographical account of how I came to England and worked on a few films, and served as assistant editor on a couple of episodes of 'The Prisoner', during the 1960s&quot;.<br /><br />As Rakoff himself admits, he came &quot;in at the tail end of things&quot; (p23) as far as the making and editing of The Prisoner was concerned, and apart from a few brief and highly uncommunicative meetings with McGoohan, whatever he (Rakoff) knew about the series was gossip and hearsay.<BR> His version of the nature of the original 'Rover', for example, is clearly not from personal experience, and conflicts with evidence that there really was a blue VW 'beetle' with flashing light.<BR> He also suggests, for no good reason, that production manager Bernard Williams came up with the idea of using weather balloons; which doesn't tally with the more widespread report that McGoohan fortuitously spotted a weather balloon in flight and gave Williams the task turning this into a practical replacement for the VW bug.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, then, even that section of the main text that deals with the TV series (pages 23-100) consists almost entirely ofvague anecdotes that are more likely to be of interest to film and TV technicians than to fans of the TV series. Nor is this section of the book entirely given over to items related to the making of The Prisoner, but regularly wanders off into pure autobiography, as in Chapters 5 and 7, for example.<br /><br />Having said all that, it might seem that Rakoff is still a key witness as regards the concepts and philosophy behind the TV series. After all, he did work as a writer on the series, didn't he?<br /><br />Well yes, sort of. It turns out that Rakoff wrote the basic story for the episode 'Living in Harmony' - but had very little to do with the final script. Indeed, on viewing the initial screening he comments:<br /><br />&quot;For a moment I couldn't believe I'd written any of what I was seeing. It seemed familiar but from somewhere far away and long ago. Dialogues struck chords.&quot; (p.98)<br /><br />The fact is that Rakoff based his own story on material in Gene Autrey (cowboy) comics of the 1950s. It's relevance to the central themes of The Prisoner was, (given his very limited time on the project), almost entirely co-incidental. And the episode as it was filmed and screened, owed nearly everything to series producer David Tomblin - who is credited as producer, scriptwriter and director on this particular episode.<br /><br />In short, if you're keen to lay your hands on 'anything' that relates to The Prisoner then you'll pobaby want to own this book as well.<BR> If, however, you're looking for material that provides genuine insights into this most enigmatic of all TV series then there are far better ways of spending your money.	2001-02-19

Does anyone 'seriously' believe that he is some kind of creationist 'sleeper'?  I suspect that in their heart of hearts even his most trenchant opponents do not, though I note that evolutionists, broad minded rationalists that they are, have a remarkable inability to think outside of a strict &quot;Them&quot; and &quot;Us&quot; scenario.<br /><br />Anyway, what Milton has provided in this book is simply a well-laid out description of the many 'facts' that conventional evolutionary theory seems unable to deal with and which therefore tend to get swept under the proverbial carpet.<br /><br />Milton DOES NOT support creationism, he doesn't even discount evolution as a scientific reality - he merely asks WHY the self-styled Darwinists and neo-Darwinists don't stop mouthing off at anyone who disagrees with them and start finding some answers to these unanswered questions.<BR> Alternatively, if Darwinism, in all its variations, CANNOT provide the answers, for goodness' sake let's move on and find a bigger and better theory.<br /><br />Trouble is, of course, most academics owe their comfy positions to having toed the party line.  How on earth do they admit they've got it at least partly wrong for so long without looking like total wallys?<br /><br />Milton's only crime - if crime it is - has been to pull some highly inconvenient skeleton's out of rather a lot of closets.  If you really want a reliable measure of the value of this book, check out its detractors.  And see how many of them offer genuine scientific criticism, and how many do little but descend into childish name calling.<br /><br />If you have the faintest interest in the evolution controversy, and your job doesn't depend on you sticking to the officially approved stories, I'm guessing that you'll love this book.	2001-02-09

Put this together with the fact that the authors are (apparently) Americans, and you can begin to see why the book fails to show any great depth of understanding of what is a very profoundly British TV series.<br /><br />At one point, for example, we are told that the Scots, Irish and Welsh Napoleans (in 'The Girl Who was Death') &quot;represent various components of the British Commonwealth&quot;.  I guess they meant the British Isles, or the United Kingdom - though neither of those groups includes Ireland, of course, only Northern Ireland.  And in any case, how does this explain the Yorkshire Napolean?<br /><br />On a different note, in their &quot;Observations&quot; regarding the episode 'A Change of Mind', the authors suggest that &quot;it is easy to make comparisons between the committee in this episode and McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee of the 1950s.&quot;<BR> If the authors knew a little more about the period when The Prisoner was filmed they might have made the rather more relevant observation that the various events in this episode very closely resemble the excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution - of the 1960s.<br /><br />I was also less than impressed by the actual episode guides.  Most of these are written in a very uninspired style and contain regular, if largely trivial, errors of fact and grammar.<BR> In the commentary for 'It's Your Funeral', for example, one of the photos shows McGoohan standing beside the helicopter with Eric Portman sitting at the controls and holding a phone.  In fact, Number 2 in this episode was played by Andre Van Gyseghem (with Derren Nesbitt as his stand-in), whilst Eric Portman played Number 2 back in episode 4 - 'Free for All'.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is certainly not a complete waste of space, containing material from production companyhandouts, script fragments, etc.  As in The Prisoner itself, the reader simply needs to be careful about sorting fact (official material) from fiction.<br /><br />Be seeing you  8¬)	2001-01-05
