Unfortunately Callen has quite a few books written and this is not one to be recommended by the author. There is no chemisty between the heroine and hero and the whole spy drama is laughable.<br />This review maybe a bit harsh and if you read this story, you will understand why. The writing is too simple and not at all interesting. The reader will probably not get through the first few chapters.<br />Charlotte comes across as too whiny and a tad immature for a widow in her early twenties.<br />Nick has no dimension. Not much more you can say about that.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2004-10-14

The two main characters are interesting enough but the overall story doesn't have enough to offer. Many fans have wanted Wulfric's story and it seems Balogh wanted to give them that but had no idea on what type of story to give him. We are given a house party for no reason, just to throw him and the heroine Christine together. It seems they just go through the actions without any real emotion.<br />The romance is very static with very minimal love scenes. Some readers will be bored by the whole story 100 pages into the book.<br />Perhaps if you are a fan of Pride and Prejudice you will enjoy this book. The hero Wulfric is a very cold and condesending character and the heroine never truly breaks him out of this mold even though she is the total oppposite from him. Perhaps if there was more for these two to do, the reader would see more passion and love grow between them.<br />Skip this one and pretend Balogh never wrote it.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2004-06-04

(C- Grade)	McCall is an excellent writer overall but this book is not a good example of her writing. The main problem with the story is there is really no chemisty or connection between Duncan and Aieleanna. The story has an interesting promise- revenge and angst from the hero against the evil sister of Aieleanna, who killed his young wife and tortured him years ago. Duncan means to take it out on her by making Aieleanna his mistress. His overall cruelity forms into affection and love but overall not believable. There is too much emotional seperation for the two and the sudden love from Duncan will make most readers scratch their heads in confusion.<br />On the positive side, McCall can write convicing life during the early middle ages. Too bad this romance is too stale.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2004-06-04

He first husband was not much to speak of and her second was so sadistic that he shared her brutally with his brother and did unmentionable acts to her body and soul. She has come home to her father yet again because her second husband has died and she has no where else to turn to. Her father is sickened by her and \\"sells\\" her to an old Scots so she will no longer be a burden to him and her family.<br />Judith has been so abused that she no longer cares where and what happens to her. She finds herself married by proxy to Alistair a Scottish lord who at first is disgusted be what has happened and by her. Soon things change though when Alistair finds out about the abuse she suffered and how strong she really is.<br />Judith learns to trust her new husband and the trust turns into full blown passion and love. Thinking she is finally safe in her new home, things turn yet again when Bennet, her brother in law arrives as part of the English army and still wants to play the sadistic games with Judith.<br />The love scenes between Judith and Alisdair are steamy but the overall story is a bit dull. The reader feels for the character of Judith but Ranney doesn't give much insight rather then just tell rather than showing.<br />This story isn't Ranney's best and doesn't show her present day ability as she writes now. Skip this one and stick with her present day titles.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2004-05-13

(B Grade)	Stephanie Laurens writes good stories with steamy love scenes that can go on for pages and heros to die for. Anthony (Tony) Blake is one of them. He is comparable to a Cynster hero, which if you are a fan of Laurens, you know what he is about. He is handsome, trustworthy, and very possesive of the heroine who is bound to become his mate in every sense.<br />Alicia is the heroine. She pretends to be a widow so her younger sister can have a season in the Ton and find a good husband. This facade almost becomes known when a so-called gentleman, who knows her secret, blackmails her into marrying him. But soon he is found dead and Tony gets involved in the case.<br />Some readers think Laurens has lost her strive up to this book because the scenarios and characters are becoming too much alike. Perhaps the same can be said for Alicia, but with Tony, Laurens has written a complex and seductive individual.<br />The mystery and suspense is so-so but the overall enjoyment of the book is watching Tony take control of the situation and of course the intimate scenes between him and Alicia. Sometimes there are way too many to count but most readers will enjoy them and need an ice cube when done reading.<br />If you are into a sensual story with a great hero, check this one out. Hopefully Laurens will keep writing better characters and move away from murder and mystery that she always sticks to.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2004-01-20

He has a secret that boarders on the occult but it is positive because he helps things heal from people to plants and the one he helps heal the most is the heroine Lily.<br />At first Lily comes across as a very spoiled child, very similiar to the character Kate from Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. Through a misunderstanding on Lily's part, Pascal and Lily get married mainly because of her tyrannical father. Lily truly has had no love in her life. Her mother left when she was a young girl, her half-brother is an immature lout and her father allows their priest to disipline his daughter in ways you wouldn't want to imagine.<br />Lily and Pascal have much to work on and to figure out who each other is. They have no trust with each other in the beginning of their relationship but slowly they reach out to each other and learn to trust and love.<br />Lily has an anger against God and faith in general. Pascal has alot of faith and is so nice at times it is hard to believe.<br />There is an old mystery to be solved and the reader learns who Pascal really is and why Lily's mother left.<br />The love scenes are not just sweet, but very hot and touching at the same time.

Amica has much more pressing problems by dealing with an obsessed madman who wants her for his own pleasure and tyrany.<br />Amica is rescued by Thomas, who is the adopted son of Eric, the former hero from \\"The Vow\\". Amica at first comes across as a timid and scared soul, but underneath she is strong willed as she tries to deal with the pain and death that has followed her throughout her life.<br />When Thomas and Amica meet, sparks and some laughs fly as Thomas has no clue on how to deal with this woman. He can hardly think when he is around her, but still wants to be with her. He constantly blames her for his \\"sickness\\" as he calls it. But Amica, gives it back to him.

He lives with his mother, father and sister and basically just works and lives a simple life. He lives this simple life because that is what everybody thinks he is limited to. Until Mary comes along....<br />Mary is a 40 something spinster, who likes order and no confusion. She lives in her own simple life also till Tim enters it. At first it looks like an employee to employer and then mother to son, then friend to friend. It becomes so much more complicated as their feelings grow into something more. But many things are against them, the age difference, their lifestyles and most importantly, Tim's mental capacity.<br />Through Tim's outlook on life, Mary comes out of her shell and finally enjoys what is around her. She helps Tim feel important and learn so much more then he was ever able to understand.<br />This story becomes so much more than an enduring love between a man and a woman. We see two lost soul who equal each other in so many ways.<br />The only thing missing is a much longer book, or even a sequel to see how Mary and Tim have succeeded.<br />So beautiful and poignant!!<br /><br />Katiebabs	2003-07-21

Nick overall is a pretty good character (more so than Maggie even though his thoughts are always on his dead wife, whom he feels he killed many years ago due to an accident.<br />Maggie is tougher to digest. All she has in her life is her dog Scout who she kidnapped from her stalker in order to save her unlike her sister who she couldn't. Nick is attracted to Maggie mainly because she is hiding secrets and looks ao lonely and afraid. And he hasn't felt this way about a woman since his wife, who was his life, his soul.. etc. Maggie is so standoffish that it is unbelieveable that any man, including Nick would be interested in her.<br />The mystery and suspense is laughable, as the villian of the piece who keeps thinking the same exact thoughts over and over to the point it becomes too annoying.<br />Somer readers may skip some parts just to get to the final standoff between Maggie and her nemesis.<br />Fans of London may appreciate this more than others but if you are looking for a taunt suspense with a good romance, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2003-06-27

US	52201750	R2AORUUZDG56ZP	067028694X	863133734	Easy Connections	Books	1	13	19	N	N	Disturbing book that says rape is okay. Do not recommend!! (F- Grade)	This book has become a cult classic in a way and is marketed to young adults. Yes, the subject of rape is controversial, but the was the author handles it is very wrong and plain disturbing. Berry makes it okay to rape a young girl because the rapist is a handsome, rich rock star. And when her brother agrees that the victim wanted it and calls her a whore, this is when this book gets thrown against the wall.<br /><br />It all starts when 17-year-old Cathy Harlow is drawing cows in a field. She wants to become a painter. Two men find her there and drag her back to their house. One of them is Paul Devlin. He is an angry and vain individual along with his band mate Chris who was the first one to spot Cathy and wants her also. They are in a band called Easy Connections and loved by England and beyond. They both decide through vindictive matters who will get this naive and innocent girl. They think she is a groupie, which the reader knows right away is not true and Dev and Chris have no reason not to believe her. Cathy ends up with Dev and he rapes her. Cathy runs away hoping to forget the whole ting. She never goes to the police or a doctor or anything of the sort to handle this trauma. Dev decides he wants Cathy to the point of obsession and practically wants to own her soul.<br /><br />Cathy tries to get on with her life by going to art school, almost falling in love with a boy there. But then Dev finds her again and to make matters worse, she is pregnant. Dev stalks her, people begin to side with Dev (mainly because he has money and is loved by millions). The outcome is shocking and leaves the story open for a sequel, which Berry has written called Easy Freedom.<br /><br />The way everything was handled in this story was just plain wrong and gives the impression just because a man is rich and beautiful, etc... it will give him the right to do whatever he wants, including violating a young girl. Cathy is close to stupid and ignorant from the point she enters the house with these two men. And the fact that people thought she wanted Dev all because of what he is, is something victims of rape have been trying to stop for generations.<br /><br />I would keep all impressionable teenage girls away from this book. What was Berry thinking when she wrote this? How has this book become so popular? Again rape is such a sticky topic, that when written about, it should be handled with respect and understanding overall. I would say it is up to the reader to decide but recommending a book like this would be wrong overall.<br /><br />KatiebabsAnd the fact that people thought she wanted Dev all because of what he is, is something victims of rape have been trying to stop for generations.

The love scenes are steamy and many of them. The villians are true evil and somewhat laughable but Cari, the heroine is strong and you will be shocked and disgusted by what she had to go through from her husband and his brother Jullian who is so obsessed with her to the point of madness.<br />Because Dominic wants revenge on Jullian, Cari becomes his mistress for revenge and to get away from Jullian (he sould have a mustache to twirl he is so evil), since her husband and son died in a fire and she is at his mercy. The chemistry between Cari and Dominic is minimal even with the passionate love scenes. We never really understand what attracted Dom to Cari. There are some over the top scenes and characters that try to move the story along, but not too well.<br />Garrett could become a better writer and the reader can see some of that in this book, but still she needs some work as does this story.<br />If you prefer over the top villians and love scenes every 5 pages, give this a try.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2003-02-10

(D Grade)	From the back:<br />Beautiful young Rosalie Belleau was swept into an aristocratic world of luxury, license and intricate intrigue when the most notorious and handsome rake in London, Lord Randall Berkeley, abducted her in the belief that she was any man's for the taking. Before he realized his mistake, he had branded her with his desire- and lost his heart to this girl...<br /><br />I believe this was Kleypas's first book written and it shows how far she has come as a writer. There are many problems with this book, including the hero raping the heroine in the first 70 pages and Rosalie accompaning Rand to France even though he violated her violently. Yet she soon falls in love with him and passion insues between them both. There are one-dimensional villians and a storyline that is boring and tecious along with love scenes that the reader has seen over and over. (yawn)<br />If you are a fan of Kleypas you will probably be disappointed in this book because her newer ones are exceptionally written. Skip this one. Not one of her best.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2003-02-10

(B+ Grade)	Rachel Gibson writes the cutest stories and See Jane Score has just been added to the list. Luc, professional hockey goaley is her typical \\"jerk\\" at the beginning of the book, but by meeting the heroine Jane, he quickly changes into a more sensitive loving guy. Jane is a true original who wears total black because she has no fashion sense, has no chest (think AA) to speak of and writes a secret column called Honey Pie who puts men into comas through her sexual antics. Jane would love to be Honey Pie but she is living real life as a simple reporter.<br />When Luc and Jane meet, the fun begins and the humor and chemistry between these two are great. The reader learns Hockey lingo and what really goes on in the locker room after the games.<br />We also get to see a transformation of Jane into a more secure woman, sexually and physically as well as Luc who changes emotionally and mentally.<br />Some would consider See Jane Score as fluff, but overall it is a great book that makes you laugh along with some great love scenes to boot.<br />To chase away the blues, pick up this latest Gibson or any of her other ones.<br /><br />Katiebabs	2003-01-30

Many well know authors have come out of this line and it is a shame that it is no longer around. Lighnting That Lingers could possibly be the best book to ever come out as a single category romance.<br />This books is very sweet and telling of human nature and what we see is not necessarily what we get.<br />Jennifer is a very shy librarian who has just started out on her own.

(C- Grade)	There is always something special when reading about heroines or heros that are more than less the perfect, especially when dealing with someone who has some disability. In the case of A Prince for Jenny, Webb could have done something great, but instead made the story too perfect from the start and too short (under 300 pages and for the Loveswept line that only fits short stories.)<br />There just wasn't enough of a plot written for it really to matter. Jenny is mentally disabled but is this perfect painter with such loving family and friends. One can believe about the loving people in her life, but her being this prodigy painter for the famous and elite is too fantasy to be true!! And the hero falling for her so quickly is too hard to be believable. The first few pages, Webb shows the hero, Daniel as brooding and being a hard man, spurned by the witchy ex-wife. Then by some feat of a miracle by meeting Jenny, he changes to an overloving and optimistic individual, a 360 to be exact.<br />Everything happened so fast, from the hero falling in love to the courting, to the marriage. Jenny was considered practically perfect except for her mental capacity.<br />Maybe if the story was expanded a bit more, and more realistic, it could have been a gem. Instead the reader rolls their eyes and wishes for the writer to give the audience a little more credit.<br />So close to giving us something worth reading, but not quite yet!<br /><br />Katiebabs<br /><br />[[ASIN:0373880774 Driving Me Crazy (Harlequin Next)]]	2002-10-26
