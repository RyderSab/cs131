Books	4	8	10	N	N	Possibly a good parable, but beware	I picked this up, largely because my business school graduate brother had read it. I'm working on getting my financial house in order, and I was hoping this book would be a good basic intro to some approaches for increasingly my wealth that were consistent with my values of discipline. While I got some good ideas, the tone of this book was not totally appealing to me, and I question some of the specific suggestion he makes.<br /><br />Some reviewers have attacked Kiyosaki as a fraud and one of the current spotlight reviews even has a link to a website that believes Kiyosaki made this whole thing up to make money. Even if Kiyosaki made up this story, the parable of a positive financial model in contrast to a poor parental financial role model is a powerful, accessible idea that has spurred this book's success. Many readers here the ideas that Rich Dad gives Mike and Kiyosaki and find themselves nodding their heads. The philosophy of sacrificing entertainment at an early age, working for peanuts to get experience, and investing in assets over liabilities are the types of basic truths that much of Kiyosaki's audience needs to hear. Just look at our current love affair with credit cards. It's easy to see that a man who can give a message to attack financial appetites and build wealth can find a popular audience.<br /><br />For me personally, this book was simple  but it did provide me with some helpful ideas. The two big ones for me were that Kiyosaki considers a first home to be a liability rather than an asset due to the large chunks of capital it ties up and that Kiyosaki considers intellectual property an asset.<br /><br />Sadly, much of this book does not focus on sound financial advice, but wanders into the realm of speculative real estate and speculative investing. Even worse, there's a lack of compassion in many of his attitudes. He believes that the government should not tax citizens significantly and that tax laws have unfairly squeezed out the middle class. This is true to an extent. But I hope Kiyosaki would not be one of those who believes that those who suffer tragedy should not be able to call on the government for support. There's also an attitude that those in the \\"rat race\\" are fools who are duped into working hard. While I think that many people make tragic financial choices, his message might be easier to swallow if he spent less time putting down people who don't dig his advice.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm struck by the strong opinions that have been aroused by this book. Folks either believe this will make them millionaires or that the man is a total fraud. The truth is probably in the middle. There are a few positive ideas here, and it might wake you up a little bit. If you're an experienced financial planner, accountant, or investor, you will probably find this either too basic or too shoddy a treatment.<br /><br />I'm not a believer, but I'm not a hater either.<br /><br />--SD<br /><br />--3 starsass.

US	43881833	R3MEKD4JHMSF17	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Still eerily relevant	A student of mine recently said, \\"I use Dune as a philosophy of life.\\" Given how hard it was to connect with this particular student, I chose to reread the book to better understand the student and to revisit a book that I loved in high school. I remember reading the entire series in school and being engrossed in the story. Now, having stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi except for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", I was wondering how I would look at Dune as literature. Interestingly, \\"Dune\\" is a \\"Reading List\\" book in Montgomery County Libraries, a well deserved indicator of its classic status.<br /><br />The pace of this first book is outstanding. You get the background necessary on the Atreides family's departure from their lush home of Caladan to the dangerous, though potentially more lucrative, world of Dune. Herbert skillfully reveals how this royal family has to adapt to the extreme conditions of the desert world. The theme of prophesy and destiny is also there from the outset with Paul Atreides trial with the Bene Gesserit \\"gom jabbar\\". The book has action, war, politics, philosophy, religious meditation, scarcely concealed environmental commentary and wonderful characters. Paul's evolution from insightful adolescent to desert prophet is the central theme of the story, but the political and military struggles between the Harkonnens and the Atreides family is equally compelling. The shifting allegiances of the struggle and the historical backgrounds that introduce each chapter are the tale telling of Herbert the master. This book is immensely ambitious and, for the most part, succeeds in creating a compelling world with compelling characters.<br /><br />I can't help stating a few things that struck me as minor flaws. The polar opposites of good and evil were a little tough for me to take at times. Duke Leto is potrayed almost as an innocent saint and Baron Harkonnen is portrayed as irredemably evil. For a book that usually tries to model real political drama in a sci-fi context, Harkonnen especially was hard to stomach at times.<br /><br />The philosophy and religion of the Bene Gesserit were interesting to me, but I think the politics are stronger than the spiritual in the book. Other readers and reviewers may disagree here, however. I'm more concerned with the Bene Gesserit and the religion of dune in future books. In contrast, Herbert's approach toward seeing the future, a philosophical core idea of the book is outstanding. Paul's struggle to negotiate vision, prophesy and leadership will challenge all to think about the challenges and responsibilities of predictions.<br /><br />There are a few key silent periods; Herbert sometimes chooses to skip a few years to maintain the pace. I don't know if they exist, but I'd like to hear tales of how Paul started leading Fremen raids or how the Harkonnens oppressed the everyday citizens of Dune. Like the history of our world, the history of Dune often neglects the everyday citizens who had to operate in the midst of conflict. Here, though, I understand Herbert. It's more that I dig the book so much that I want to know more about Dune in this time period than that I think Herbert could have written a significantly better book.<br /><br />I dig Dune even better than the Star Wars world, especially given Lucas' flawed efforts in the prequels. It's just harder to write visually stunning stuff for movies in a bland desert than in \\"a galaxy far, far way\\". Still I can't help but wonder if Lucas borrowed any ideas in constructing Tattoine?<br /><br />Kind of wandering here, but I hope everyone gets the point. This is great sci-fi, not to be missed if you've get any interest in the genre at all.<br /><br />6 stars!!!<br /><br />--SDci-fi context, Harkonnen especially was hard to stomach at times. <br /> <br />The philosophy and religion of the Bene Gesserit were interesting to me, but I think the politics are stronger than the spiritual in the book.

I first wandered into Suze Orman's website when I was looking to find out my FICO score, and I then picked up this book after that. This book has a wealth of practical knowledge for those trying to get started in the real world, and I wish that I had read it when I was coming out of college. The book wisely assumes little knowledge on how to go about making choices that will pay off in the long term. Much of the nuts and bolts information of kinds of retirement plans and the value of a FICO score can be found elsewhere. Yet the tone of this book is clear and easy going even as it deals with real choices and heavy decisions; that approach really worked for me. Some of the suggestions were little practical things that I would not have thought of elsewhere. The little step of trying to \\"practice\\" in a savings account before taking on new bills is wise. Her suggestions for prioritizing how to save were helpful. I found her attitude towards credit cards to be creative yet realistic. Use credit cards for something that you'd be willing to pay double the price, and do accept that some debt may be necessary initially to be able to work in a field related to your mission that allows for potential advancement. I think that many people my age see debt as a purely black and white issue: either it's evil and to be avoided at all cost or it's free money to satisfy your \\"needs\\".<br /><br />I gained a lot from this book, and it's sparked some good conversations with my girlfriend as we determine whether our relationship can stand up to the long haul. I recommend this highly to anyone who feels they have more to learn about financial decisions.<br /><br />--5 stars<br /><br />SD	2005-08-25
US	43881833	R3FF2G9B8IQR1Q	055337849X	208985901	The Brothers K	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Massive book, very ambitious, but worth it	This novel is huge in its scope and the family it tries to portray. Fundamentalist Seventh Day Adventism and Baseball are the twin gods that birth the Chance family. Four wildly different brothers, 2 daughters and a host of secondary characters are followed for what must be 20+ years of adventures. What seems to be a family novel of a small town minor leaguer and the life in the shadow of his mill evolves into a mediation on Vietnam, Eastern religions, psychiatry and the need for simplicity in an increasingly chaotic world. Narrated by Kincaid, the youngest of the four brothers, each of the other three brothers make decisions that carry them far afield of their small town roots. Each must also decide whether to embrace, reject, or circumvent the opposing poles of father and mother in the family.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel and I would recommend it to anyone with the time to stew in it for awhile. I felt that this novel could have been about 200 pages shorter and still effective. I didn't get all of the introductory quotes to the chapters which range from literature to Eastern religious texts to baseball quotes and poets. I enjoyed most of the tales of the chance family individually, but the conclusion of the book and all that it resolves does not need every episode to fulfill its importance.<br /><br />Initially I was turned off by this book because of the title \\"The Brothers K\\". Dostoevsky is alluded to at various points in the story but is less the central player than I thought he would be. It's been awhile since I read the Brothers Karamazov but I feel that \\"The Brothers K\\" strives to portray a family more than to ponder existential despair. From my vantage point, \\"The Brothers K\\" seems more explicitly humanitarian and more explicitly political but that may just be my greater familiarity with Viet Nam.<br /><br />I applaud Duncan's work even as I believe that he could have written a tighter novel. But I imagine he enjoyed birthing these characters so much that he had a hard time letting them go or abridging their stories.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />--SDmuch that he had a hard time letting them go or abridging their stories. <br /> <br />4.5 stars. <br /> <br />--SD	2005-07-13

I'm not sure exactly what the Pulitzer Prize people saw in this one that made it a classic. This starts out as a Horatio Alger story of Martin Dressler, who advances quickly from cigar maker's son to trusted employee at a hotel and then begins to dream big dreams of owning hotels. His march forward parallels the growth of New York City. Anyone's who been to Manhattan can grow from seeing how men like Dressler profited from and stimulated upper Manhattan's transformation from suburbia to one of the densest popultaion areas in the world. Dressler's relationship with a mother and her two daughters is also central to the plot. Romance, friendship, and business are all tied up in his relationship to this family and the juxtaposition between his amazing prosperity as a businessman and his dreaminess with the women in his life may be what convinced some readers that this fable is a profound book.<br /><br />I was not blown away by the writing style. I felt the author enjoys listing items, many of which are beautiful, but were tough for me to visualize. Martin's visions of hotels get stretched beyond the point of credibility as well. This bugged me because I felt what could have been a powerful historical novel or a complex exploration on the tensions between family and total dedication to one's professional mission was held secondary to a desire to make this an allegorical novel on America's romance with buildings and novelty.<br /><br />This was an okay novel that ironically, may be a decent novel for a high school student looking for something accessibly yet meaningful. I enjoyed reading it, but I was expecting more from this than I got out of it. It's a relatively quick read at least so others may find this worth the time and see something that I may be missing.<br /><br />Scratching my head...<br /><br />3 stars<br /><br />--SD	2005-07-12

Outside of Colson Whitehead and Eric Levaille [not sure of spelling], it's tough to find black authors who wish to operate out of the well-trodden Eric Dickey mold. I enjoy his stuff, but once one author finds marketing success, publishers are not too interested in finding authors willing to operate outside a successful formula.<br /><br />Erasure is first and foremost a wry, satirical commentary on these formulas and white america's inability to evaluate ghetto literature properly. Monk Ellison is an overly intellectual, invisible author who is concerned with writing challenging novels for a primarily academic audience. He's chagrined to find his books wrongly placed in the Af-american section of his local Borderslike store and horrified that a book such as \\"We's Lives in the Ghetto\\", authored by a middle-class author with minimal exposure to the 'hood can become a best selling author and national celebrity. His satirical response to this, a novel he eventually titles \\"F*ck\\" gives him enormous success and that success and Monk's relation to it is the heart of this novel.<br /><br />This novel is deeper than just being a satirical commentary on publishing today. Monk's family and his relationships with his mother, who suffers from Alzeimer's, and her maid is touching. Monk as a character is far more worthy of empathy as he wrestles with his status as a favored child in a black middle class family and his responsbilities in keeping it together in the middle of adversity. I found this aspect of the story at least as strong as the publishing stuff with Percival Everett may have enjoyed writing a little too much.<br /><br />Everett's decision to publish Monk's novel in full in the middle of the book will strike readers as either wildly funny or entirely unnecessary. I think a chapter would have been adequate. There were a lot of inside literary references and an insider kind of paper that Monk writes which were a little to insider for me.<br /><br />This isn't going to push Zora Neale Hurston and Ralph Ellison off the shelves for me, but if you can work with Everett's style and are into satirical stuff, maybe an Ishmael Reed fan, you may find this to be a wonderful book.<br /><br />-4 stars.<br /><br />SDwhich were a little to insider for me.  <br /> <br />This isn't going to push Zora Neale Hurston and Ralph Ellison off the shelves for me, but if you can work with Everett's style and are into satirical stuff, maybe an Ishmael Reed fan, you may find this to be a wonderful book. <br /> <br />-4 stars. <br /> <br />SD	2005-07-11

For all those who can dig the lates Batman Begins, or Fantastic Four, fewer take the time to consider how comic books or created and the heroism that earlier writers demonstrated in creating such memorable characters. This novel grabs you in with the adventures of Josef Kavalier, trained in the arts of Houdini and a magnificient artist, with his brother Sam Klay the business and story end of their tremendously successful partnership that creates The Escapist. Watching these boys birth their hero and ride the wave of its success is exhilarating stuff by a materful teller of tales.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Sam and Josef, comic book writing is coupled with exploitation. For Josef, an escapee of the Holocaust himself, he is tragically unable to fulfill his anger against Hitler and Germany in his imaginary wars through his comic book characters. Josef, Sam, and Rosa Saks, Josef's love interest struggle to heal Josef. This story arc was less gripping for me, and I put this book down midway through the first time I read it.<br /><br />This summer I came back to it, and found the book to be worth the effort. I'm not going to give away Josef's struggles or the ending, but I enjoyed seeing the boys wrestle with adult problems. Some who enjoy the comic book stuff may not enjoy the second half as much. Others will find hidden depth in the unconventional musings on family, friendship, and the Holocaust. This is not my favorite book I've read this summer [Curious Incident of the Dog and The Calligrapher are higher for me], but it is a magnificient work and worthy of its Pulitzer status.<br /><br />4 stars.<br /><br />--SD	2005-07-11

I was expecting a lush romance in the Latin<br /><br />tradition of \\"Love in the time of Cholera\\" that portrayed an entire family. The marriage of an Irish immigrant and his Cuban wife in Pennsylvania gave me a picture of a unique family and a different perspective on how families can arrive into our country. But it was really hard for me to figure out what this book was specifically about. A couple of characters get greater emphasis but it is more a long series of episodes than a novel that progresses towards an ending or even a complex picture. I think the novel would have worked better as a collection of short stories than the rambling work we have here.<br /><br />Not bad, but I don't think this is the author's best work and I may try something else by Hijuelos like Mambo Kings before I give up on him. I enjoyed his prose and I hope to read something by him that tells a better tale.<br /><br />2.5 stars<br /><br />--SD	2005-07-10

Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.<br /><br />Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.<br /><br />2 stars	2005-06-20

The event driving this novel is the death of a dog? And I don't even like dogs! There is much more in store, however. Haddon's portrayal of Chris as a first-person narrator feels right to me. His reports on how he can get overloaded by too many people or two many stimuli rings true. His literal interpretation of rules and his precise totally logical approach to the world gives a unique perspective to the family events (which I shall not reveal) that surprise him and the reader.<br /><br />Chris proves to be courageous in facing his fears and challenging himself to find the killer and find out about those he cares for, in his own enigmatic way, the most. If you've been hedging on this one, you'll find it moves quickly but surprises and gives you an insightful look into a boy and his world.<br /><br />Last thing is that the form of the novel really held my interest. Lots of math for those who are interested in that kind of thing including a proof in the appendix! Great type of book to try and connect mathematics with a way of looking at the world. Sure, Chris is an extreme of that view, but his natural aptitude for mathematics can show others how mathematicians think. There's a great joke, his only joke [after he promises not to tell jokes but then says his lie is not a lie but a *clarification*] about an economist, a logician, and a mathematician that I found laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />There's lots of good stuff here. Try it, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />four and a half stars. Let's hope there's a sequel!	2005-06-20

Those who are interested in applying for Teach for America would gain a lot from this book as it gives some perspective on the process through bite size biographies. For me, I would have liked either greater detail about the subjects interviewed or more hefty analysis of TFA as a way to address the national teacher shortage.<br /><br />I did learn a few things from this book. I now know that TFA endorses high stakes testing as a way to demonstrate that their teachers are competent in the classroom at generating score improvement. I'm also aware that there's a real tension between getting the \\"elite\\" graduates to staff the program versus finding people who will commit to teaching for the long haul.<br /><br />I remain positive on Teach For America, not because it's perfect, but because I feel that it is one possible strategy for addressing the teacher shortage. Still, I'm not sure that I wouldn't learn more about the program from someone with a stronger background in teaching or educational policy or even from some of the more detailed profiles in magazines on TFA teachers.<br /><br />This is a good intro to the program, but I hope other researchers who can go beyond just interviewing as a research technique will join the field to figure out how to make a positve program a great program and provide honest debate on how to address the national teacher shortage.<br /><br />3.5 stars<br /><br />--SD	2005-02-16

This was on the bookshelf of the tutoring center where I work and I thought I'd see what this man's case was.<br /><br />For the most part, I found this to be an intentional counterbalance to business as usual. It appears that there are a great many reviewers with the psychology background to assess how he may set up BF Skinner as a straw man to strike down. I'm not sure it's necessary to set up Skinner as a man to strike down. I do agree with Kohn, however, that \\"pop behaviorism\\" and incentive driven behaviors are pervasive in our culture. Incentive plans in business, grades at school, and rewards at home are commonly thought of strategies for management. Kohn consistently attacks the abuses and excesses of incentives and gives a coherent framework for what makes rewards wrong, focusing on how relationships are fragmented and creativity and attention are undermined. As a teacher who has seen grade obsessed students in tutoring and classroom situations, any book that provides philosophical and psychological research to advocate for intrinsic learning is welcomed.<br /><br />Readers should be aware that this is a *very* radical book. Like other radicals, Kohn is probably better at ripping down the capitalist, or in this case incentive-based, order than in building something up to replace it with. Kohn wants us to reason with people and clearly communicate agreed upon objectives. Has Kohn ever tried to implement these strategies in a classroom of 35-40 urban students? I believe that he would argue we should have smaller class sizes that we could value intrinsic motivation, but I question whether he would be living in the real world at that point. There are some valuable bullet points in the final 80-100 pages of the book where he advocates for strategies. Maybe his other works go at that side. Fundamentally, though he asks us to get away from our American focus on ends such as profits, grades, and behavioral complicity from our children. That makes this book truly radical and I am still weighing in my own mind how convinced I am about the pragmatic value of this book.<br /><br />I think this book is valuable reading about the dangers of using rewards without thought for the long-term consequences of those rewards. I caution readers from joining Kohn wholeheartedly for in many ways, he seems to me to be a counterconsultant rather than an established educator with unassailable results or a business leader who has built a business implementing his principles. Now that I think of it, I yearned for the long term narratives of success stories where I could interpret details. He does cite a lot of research studies in support of his views, but I am not enough of a psychologist to ascertain whether I am fully convinced of the value in embracing the risks inherent with embracing his views full force.<br /><br />Stay tuned. I might edit this one and say this has been a paradigm altering book that leads me away from keeping test prep as part of my personal mission.

That makes this book truly radical and I am still weighing in my own mind how convinced I am about the pragmatic value of this book. <br /> <br />I think this book is valuable reading about the dangers of using rewards without thought for the long-term consequences of those rewards. I caution readers from joining Kohn wholeheartedly for in many ways, he seems to me to be a counterconsultant rather than an established educator with unassailable results or a business leader who has built a business implementing his principles. Now that I think of it, I yearned for the long term narratives of success stories where I could interpret details. He does cite a lot of research studies in support of his views, but I am not enough of a psychologist to ascertain whether I am fully convinced of the value in embracing the risks inherent with embracing his views full force. <br /> <br />Stay tuned. I might edit this one and say this has been a paradigm altering book that leads me away from keeping test prep as part of my personal mission. As it stands, I consider this a book that has helped me by raising some unresolved questions in my mind. <br /> <br />4 stars. <br /> <br />--SD	2005-01-25

I read \\"One-Minute Manager\\", which Spencer Johnson cowrote and was expecting a similarly illustrative tale with similar concrete strategies for management and interpersonal relations. This book has some positive ideas and it is a *very* easy read. You can read it an about an hour or two. The central message is that change is inevitable and that we must adapt to it to get our Cheese. Also, we are happiest when we pretend to be fearless and enjoy adapting to change. I am not sure, however, that these notions qualify as sufficiently profound insights to warrant the bestseller status of this book. Adapting to change and discovering the freedom of \\"what would I do if I weren't afraid\\" is an idea that many spiritual teachers have articulated. I believe the preface where it says that the story of Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw in this book originated from a motivational talk or favored parable. As a motivational speech this might be stronger than as a hardcover book worth $15-20.<br /><br />I think this is a book that you read in a library or browse in a megabookstore rather than purchase online. Taken lightly without earthshattering expectations it is positive and helpful although there are probably better books on this subject.<br /><br />3 stars<br /><br />I can see why mixed reviews on this. If you've read a lot of philosopnhy or spiritual text you might find this really redundant. But if you haven't this may be a good first step and a catalyst for positive change.	2005-01-05

Based on my personal history and my gig as a teacher, I have tremendous interest in the subject. This is the first book I've read on ADD and I found this to be a thorough, though perhaps overly positive, treatise on ADD from a talented psychiatrist who clearly has compassion for his patients.<br /><br />Hallowell is a clear writer and this book will be helpful to a very wide audience. He brings in many case histories that illuminate his clear points. Towards the second half of the book he offers many bullet points for strategies and treatments to different audiences. Some reviewers have complained about redundancy. Yes, many of the points are redundant, but I feels he does this for two valid reasons. First, he wishes to emphasize the importance of a comprehensive diagnosis and the value of education. Secondly, he wisely realizes that many teachers and other niche audiences will spend a day or two with the book skimming through fifty pages or so and I think he wants to make sure all audiences get his most important points.<br /><br />He does a quality job reaching different audiences. Teachers, ADD parents, ADD adults, even a precocious ADD middle schooler or high schooler could read this book all the way through and learn a lot. I'm not sure if there's as much as I would like for ADD employers, although I greatly appreciate the fact that he mentions that ADD is a recognized disability that is protected by antidiscrimination laws. If anyone has this disease, knowing that they can discuss \\"reasonable accomdations\\" with their employer and be at least partially protected is a great help. I'm not sure how much this book would add to the psychotherapy community, but even here I think the reliance on case studies is helpful.<br /><br />The book does have a few weaknesses that the glowing reviews overlook. One reviewer went with a one star blast because he neglects the consequences of overdiagnosis. Yes, this book is almost totally positive on a psychological approach over what may be better served by a sociological [change TV!], spiritual [have folks attend to their Maker over their random thoughts], or professional [deal with it!] kind of approach. That didn't really bother me but so much because he does make it clear throughout the book the importance on a diagnosis that includes the patient's history, outside input on the patient's experiences and habits, and even a doctor to rule out other potential causes. I do believe ADD and executive functioning disorders are both overdiagnosed and overmedicated in the Potomac, MD population where I currently tutor and parents have access to tremendous medical and monetary resources. Likewise, I believe that many people choose ADD diagnoses to classify poor children into special ED [see Washington, DC's astronomically high special ed budget] when environmental factors such as cold schools with crumbling facilities may be the distracting elements that provoke students to ADD like symptoms. A passing mention of pseudo-ADD is not adequate to address some of the consequences of over diagnosis and I wish he had done more outside research on ADD in schools and ADD in society. I felt most of his research was reporting on what was going on in his successful private practice. Not everyone doing the diagnosing is an ADD expert like this author and not everyone will have access to an ADD expert with this author's qualifications. What do we do in those circumstances, when you are an underemployed or unemployed parent, you check this book out of the library, and you are disheartened that this book seems to be written for an audience who has the insurance or the money to seek all available help for the child. Many times he goes out of his way to show that many of his case studies came from good homes. What happens when ADD symptoms appear in a child or adult who comes from a more damaging background?<br /><br />I am thankful for the authorfor writing this book and my friend for recommending this book. I learned a lot from this and I would give this my unqualified recommendation for anyone interested in this frustrating illness.<br /><br />[4 stars]<br /><br />SDhe author for writing this book and my friend for recommending this book.

I picked up a friend's copy of this book hoping to demystify the circumstances surrounding the King James Bible, the translation of choice for many black americans. This book introduced me to the subject and was worth my time, but I suspect there may be better works on the subject.<br /><br />The initial historical context was very helpful for me. Understanding that this book was created by a new Scottish king of England to unify his kingdom and further solidify his throne is a major insight for me. The paradox of James with his consuming personality and foreign influences generating this project is powerfully stated. The irony of a man like Lancelot Andrewes, who evaded serving the poor and sick during the plague on London, serving as a chief translator pricks the balloon that these were holy infallible men who had nothing but the unadulterated word of God as their guide. Nicholson makes it clear that this was both a religious and a political project, a sharp contrast to the earlier translation by the martyr Tyndale.<br /><br />Nicholson admits late in the book that he is not a churchgoer and his interests in the work seem to be more poetic than spiritual. Several specific examples highlight what he feels to be the vastly superior word choices of translators in comparison to both earlier and later translations. He does seem to do a good job of capturing the regalness of the translation.<br /><br />As someone who has read more thorough historical works, I wanted a more thorough job of fleshing out the history. Several times in the book, Nicholson will find one historical reference that allows him to speculate on the biographical motivations of the translators. At times, Nicholson seemed to oscillate between a series of biographical portraits which may be interesting but divert away from his subject and a meditation on the beauty of the text. He makes a case for how the majesty of the King James Bible parallelled the architectural excess of Jacobean England as well that I was unconvinced by. I wanted more historical details so that I could devise some of my own interpretations to how this book and its authors affect the Bible in practice. Only in the last few pages does he describe what happened to the Bible once it was created.<br /><br />I feel this book, while helpful, was confused between a historical meditation on the Bible and a choppy biography of the interpreters. I learned a great deal, but I will probably find other books on the subject more helpful. For a popular audience, this readable book may be a good introduction, but I suspect there's better stuff out there.<br /><br />[3 stars]akes a case for how the majesty of the King James Bible parallelled the architectural excess of Jacobean England as well that I was unconvinced by.

This book is lickety-split-quick. I read it in about two hours. The story is a fable about a young man who wants to meet the ideal manager, who turns about to be a \\"one-minute-manager\\", a composite taken from the authors' research. This book illustrates simple principles in an accessible way with focus on goal setting, affirmation, and effective, though caring, criticism when goals are not met.<br /><br />For me, this is an effective book as this is a new area of research focus for me. If you're starting out with management techniques or understanding management techniques, then books like this provide accessible points of entry into the field. Ultimately, the book struggles with two flaws that reduce my rating. First, I would like to have more access to the research that generated the one-minute-manager. Without that research this book can be viewed as a fictional fable rather than a practical one. Second, I feel that while effective, several of the techniques are not practical for American business. I asked my dad, a Wharton grad, about this book, and he said that it was in vogue for a while in the 1980s and then lost its influence in ways that books like \\"The Seven Habits of Effective People\\" did not. I feel that the reason the book fails is that it treats American employees and employers like rational, grounded individuals. If you read the Wall Street Journal and the newspapers, you realize that Americans are irrational beings and that this ideal is not always practical. Setting goals with a person that has been marginalized culturally, spiritually, economically, and socially is too reductionist an approach. I'm very interested in programs and management styles that will work with difficult employees, the one's that currently sap the strength of most of the large businesses in corporate America and the large institutions such as our public schools. I think that books like \\"The One Minute Manager\\" are best for start ups and new blood who want to impose a new corporate culture on a blank slate. For the majority of businesses that are established and trying to dramatically change course, the ideas in this book will be helpful, but not immediately applicable.<br /><br />--4 stars<br /><br />--SDour public schools.

Also, I'm deeply interested in creative answers to the issue of democratically educating the Underclass. This book met some of my needs, but I can't give it an unqualified recommendation.<br /><br /> Really, Ravitch devotes most of her efforts to giving a history of Progressivism in education. Consdierable time is spent on Dewey, Kilpatrick, and their followers. The book starts around the time of Eliot's Committee of Ten Report detailing how all should receive a college preparatory education and discusses how progressivism chipped away at this democratic ideal. There is a little bit of respect for Progressivism's desire to make classroom less dependent on rote memorization. But Ravitch gives an accurate critique of Progressivsm's ultimate consequences: in an effort to make the child's experience the center of the classroom and the focus of learning, the academic content of the curriculum was diluted. Ravitch clearly holds Progressivism to be largely responsible for why our nation lags behind other nations in most international evaluations of school quality. I learned from this book that Progressivism's core concepts have remained the same under different rhetorical incarnations. I also learned that ultimately, Ravitch considers Progressivism to be antidemocratic because it made college preparatory content optional; only the children of elites or the most highly motivated students opted for the rigorous college preparatory track. For those immigrants and minorities who desperaely needed college to gain access to the American mainstream, Progressivism's goal to satisfy the desires of the students [but not their parents!] had tragic consequences.<br /><br /> I have a few criticisms of this book. I don't think that much original scholarship was done for this book. Cremin and Krug, two noted historians, are often referred to. I think Ravitch's emphasis is different than prior scholarship in that she gives more room for the opponents of Progressivism. But I don't know how much is new.<br /><br /> I'm really critical over the focus on the educational establishment. So much of this book describes rhetorical debate between proponents and critics of reforms in the educational schools. As a teacher, I know that much of what ed schools desire doesn't get put into practice. I wanted to hear more of the voices of the students and the teachers who were most affected by the reforms.<br /><br /> Lastly, for a book that claims to focus on &quot;a century&quot; of school reform, the 60s were covered too quickly for my tastes. Brown<br /><br /> v Board of Ed is not introduced until page 367 and it gets about 15 pages. The debate over school busing is barely mentioned. Charter school issues and school choice, a key complement to the standards movement of the 90s is also barely mentioned. These were some of the issues that I care most about. The relative lack of discussion on these areas reveals that Ravitch is more interested in Progressive curriculum reform than reform efforts in school structure [introduciton of junior high schools is an exception to this]. Also, for those who seek to understand contemporary debates, the last 20-30 years is covered in a rather cursory fashion.<br /><br /> This book was a quality discussion of Progressivism and how it hijacked democratic rhetoric for covert and overt antidemocratic ends. It falls short of being a total history of school reform and it misses a valuable opportunity to introduces more voices of teachers, parents, and students into the traditional histories that usually emphasize the debates in the ed schools and the history of the bureaucrats.<br /><br /> I learned some stuff, but wanted to learn a lot more.<br /><br /> 3 stars<br /><br /> --SDor this book.

Principally, Caro spends an enormous amount of time rehashing the events of volume 1, often in exactly the same language as in the earlier work. I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this may have been stronger as a 200-250 page tag to Caro's earlier volume.<br />Yet the story does focus on 3 major details in Johnson's life that are essential to understanding his future relationship to the American public and the manner in which he would wield Senatorial and Presidential power. First, Caro goes into the facts behind Johnson's war service and exposes the political fuel for his service and how he subsequently exaggerated or outright lied about his military record to gain political favor. Not the most important thing in the book but definitely interesting new info.<br />Secondly, Caro reveals how Johnson leveraged his political influence to gain control of a fledgling radio station and turn it into the foundation of his personal fortune. This is a major revelation as it demonstrates that Johnson, while frustrated politically during the 40s, found a way to gain a fortune using his political contacts.<br />Lastly, the entire second half of this book focuses on the Senate primary between Johnson and Coke Stevenson. Caro, while respecting Johnson's energy and creativity in pursuing his aims, considers this an entirely tragic episode in Texas and American politics. The manner in which Johnson obtained funds and outspent his noble candidate bothers Caro. More importantly, Caro feels that Johnson's stolen votes in many ways were the foundation of the credibility gap in Texas politics and in the later Johnson presidency. Caro makes a special point to show how Johnson relished the fact that he used his guile to steal votes, even showing a picture of himself with those he purchased the votes from to a reporter as president. Many reviewers feel this book is too negative on Johnson, but I am convinced by the facts given that a negative position on Johnson is warranted, especially given the amorality of the tactics he used in winning the election.<br />Where I was less convinced was in the nobility of Coke Stevenson as Johnson's foil. Sure Stevenson did not appear to steal votes in the manner of Johnson or vacillate in his positions or really go negative in attacking his candidate. But on the other hand, Stevenson exhibited debilitating tactical blindness and stubborn pride in not directly confronting Johnson's attacks or changing his style in some ways to meet changing times. Stevenson may have had more integrity, but I also feel that he was a deeply conservative politician who was more interested in his political principles than in the political reality he faced. Caro spends so much time portraying him as &quot;Mr. Texas&quot; that I feel he glosses over many of his faults. While Stevenson was a better man, I am not sure he would have been an effective Senator and the United States may have been worse off having him as Senator. I felt that Caro's dislike for Johnson, though justified, led him to distort his portrayal of Stevenson.<br />Overall, though this is a good book which could have been done just a little bit better.

I've read several past presidential biographies and I felt that LBJ's legacy and history were important for me if I were to grasp the motivating forces behind Civil Rights history and Vietnam.<br />This book exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a gripping read. Caro gives his reader story, character, and research. The length of this book is its strength because he gives the reader so much context for the events. Before talking about how LBJ brought electric power to his impoverished home district for example, Caro breaks away for a 14 page illumination of the realities of day to day to living without electricity entitled &quot;The Sad Irons&quot;. Where many other biographers make their subject the sole focus, Caro generously supplies his reader with the details that make you empathize for the characters he portrays. In that sense, I put this book almost up there with Richard Kluger's &quot;Simple Justice&quot; for its ability to create vibrant vivid history.<br />Caro does see LBJ in a somewhat negative light, although he tries to temper his criticism with understanding of why he became the way he is. Caro respects the political genius of Johnson in his admiration for Johnson's work ethic and drive during the 1937 campaign for Congress. He also admires how LBJ did take pride and gain satisfaction for the individual voters that he presented and the benefits he won for them as a Congressman.<br />Yet I expect a Macbeth as I read Caro's later volumes. Caro disapproves of Lyndon's unwillingness to take a stand and reveals how the Lyndon Johnson succeeded in part because he was a &quot;professonal son&quot; exceedingly capable of earning the good graces of those with the power to help him be they Sam Rayburn, President Roosevelt, or even the college president as he struggled to earn tuition.<br />So many episodes in this book will linger. I almost wish LBJ had been an anonymous teacher after hearing how successful he was in the two positions he held early on in his career. The power that he earned through his stint as unofficial Congressional campaign manager is amazing as is his ability to balance New Deal rhetoric  with conservative financial backing.<br />Besides LBJ you gain the story of his rural district, a lesser know side of the New Deal, the beginnings of the awesome power of Texas Oil and understanding of democratic politics.<br />I could go on so much, but all I can say is if you are at all interested in LBJ this book will be worth the effort.<br />5 stars!<br />--SDook will linger.

He provides a solid context for Duke Ellington's development in the Washington music scene. You can see how Duke soaked up neighborhood piano, ragime, and ensemble influences as he evolved from musical entrepreneur to fledgling composer. This early section added a lot of well-researched info to my knowledge of Ellington.<br />As the scene shifts to New York, the emphasis on personality, character, and context shifts and Tucker shifts largely to extremely detailed musical analysis of Ellington's early records. Here he betrays that this book is primarily intended for an academic audience of fellow Ellington and hardcore jazz scholars. Without keyboard skills the numerous musical examples weren't as beneficial to me, although I am sure that piano players and arrangers would find this section quite helpful. I imagine he does a useful job of counteracting many interpretations of Duke's life that there is little musical value to his pre-Cotton club work, but I already had a sense that Bubber Miley and Joe Nanton made valuable solo and compositional contributions on tunes like &quot;Black and Tan Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Creole Love Call&quot;, and &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot; before reading this work. I did gain from how Tucker's wealth of knowledge allowed him to compare how these works compared to solos and other compositions of the period. I did not realize how influential King Oliver's stuff was on Ellington through the ideas of his soloists.<br />I wanted more stories of what it was like for the band in New York than I got here, but it was still a very informative read nonetheless.<br />I rate this book 3.5 stars for non academics, probably 4.5 stars for those who can easily comprehend the musical examples.

It was created to coincide with a Smithsonian exhibit and it offers a quality professional biography of Ellington's life and times. The author considers Ellington's life a series of problems to solve for his mind. Some of these problems are how to learn piano, how to start a band, how to compose with a partner, how to react to the recording band, how to deal with the loss of key soloists, how to compose larger works and ends up hitting many of the high points of Ellington's life and works.<br />Most of the new research at the time came from Mercer Ellington's enormous donation of his warehouse of materials for the Duke Ellington collectionl. Yet as a book intended for a popular audience, the musical content of this trove was not really fully dealt with. Mercer's collection comes through in the fabulous photographs that are interspersed throughout the book. It may have been better to have all the photographs grouped in several sections as not everyone will have time to read the entire book I suppose.<br />One very helpful aspect to the book was that at the end of each chapter there was a guide to key recordings of Ellington's life. This type of material is very helpful to those new to Ellington's life.<br />I found the prose to be clear and adequate although not as lively as some of the other excellent jazz biographies I've read such as Chambers' Milestones.<br />This book gets a 4.5 star rating for anyone new to Ellington. It's accessible, readable, and gives you several ideas to approach the true gold mine of Ellington's music.<br />For jazz researchers and scholars, there's still room for a knockout biography of Ellington that adds the information from the Smithsonian collection to wide ranging interviews and even better prose. Researchers will want to read this, but I'm not sure how much of this material is groundbreaking.<br />4.5 stars for neophytes<br />3.5 stars for Ellington scholars<br />4 stars overallars<br />4 stars overall	2004-05-29

They treat consumption as a disease and the books chapter looks at symptoms like &quot;shopping fever&quot;, &quot;rash of bankrupticies&quot; and the &quot;addictive virus&quot;. The book is very accessible and is designed, like the documentary its based on, for a very wide audience. Consumption is dangerous, deadening, and ultimately destructive for our society and the first half of the book details its dangerous effects. Their is a strong focus on environmental consequences, but they also detail how consumption is taught to our children and how it has become a spiritual drain on most Americans.<br />The second portion of the book is a very brief discussion on causes of affluenza and how it grew in the roaring 20s, the prosperous 50s and became an epidemic under Reagan and then supported by formerly green democrats like Gore. This was helpful for me, but they could have gone into greater depth on the psychology of affluenza and for me income inequality deserved greater emphasis. A major blindspot was ignoring how the art of black Americans, a major barometer of the underclass, has gone from the church and socially critical messages of What's Going On to the consumption driven music of Jay Z, Puffy and much of current rap music.<br />The last portion of the book quickly goes through cures for affluenza and while I found some of the suggestions beneficial on a personal level, the proposed cures seemed utopian and heavily biased towards Seattle quasi Utopian communities. I was left very unclear how an urban community in Washington, DC would apply some of the philosophies of this book on a local level.<br />The tone of the authors is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, they right in readable prose and they intersperse the text with political cartoons for emphasis of points. I showed these to my grandmother and she found these hilarious. On the other hand, they often use a sledgehammer to drive home a point where a soft point will do. They will assume some of their conclusions at timew without fully backing them up.<br />Here's an example [p153] &quot;Remember how the communists were going to destroy the businesses in our town.

This is the first full length biography I've read on Ellington, although I did take a course with Mark Tucker, author of &quot;The Ellington Reader&quot; in college. This book is written by a psychologist and a musician of the 1940s, not a researcher, and the previous reviewers have criticized him for a lack of research. Lawrence relies heavily on Sonny Greer and Mercer Ellington as interview subjects and there may be the value in skimming through this biography. As a drummer, the story of how Greer got his magnificent drum kit that you see in all of the 30s and 40s footage of the Ellington brought me a smile. Stories like this lead me to believe that Lawrence would have been better served facilitating a memoir of Sonny Greer and some of his musical contacts [he admits that he was trying to do this until Hentoff's &quot;Hear me Talkin' to Ya came out in his introduction] than writing a flawed biography of Ellington, a towering figure who deserves a thorough scholarly biography like the one that Lewis Porter did for John Coltrane.<br />The book has two other big flaws. First, the 50s and 60s are really quickly treated and he will go through a year of the band's life in a couple of pages. I personally was first drawn to Ellington's music through this musically rich period and while the creation of some of Ellington's key suites like the Far East Suite is mentioned, I would have liked a better sense of what life in the band was like at this time.<br />The biggest problem, here, however, is that Lawrence the psychologist intervenes at times and leaves the reader with a sour taste in his mouth. I do not need speculation on the psychological nature and &quot;narcissistic&quot; elements of Ellington's personality. I'd rather get detailed research as to what happened in his personal life from varied sources and allow me, the intelligent reader, to draw my own conclusions. The fact that the last paragraph of the book concludes with a statement of his &quot;profound narcissism&quot; and how Ellington just wanted &quot;everybody in the palm of my hand&quot;, diminishes the ultimate musical and spiritual legacy that Ellington left behind.<br />Right now, I don't see a major full length biography of Ellington on the market that I can completely endorse. This book has some value as a quick, though flawed, overview of the band while introducing members like the great Sonny Greer.<br />2 stars.<br />--SDfact that the last paragraph of the book concludes with a statement of his &quot;profound narcissism&quot; and how Ellington just wanted &quot;everybody in the palm of my hand&quot;, diminishes the ultimate musical and spiritual legacy that Ellington left behind.<br />Right now, I don't see a major full length biography of Ellington on the market that I can completely endorse.

I enjoyed reading the book because the prose was readable and the story is so compelling. It would take colossal ineptitude to make this story unworthy of reading. The chess match of the century, the Cold War backdrop, the drama of the proceedings, and most importantly the titanic chess struggle between two fo the unquestioned greats of the game.<br />I am relatively knew to chess literature so I can't comment on how much of the information in this book is earth shattering. My sense from reading it is that more insight is gained on the Russian side and the dissension within Spassky's camp.<br />The subtitle is revealing in that clearly the authors place a lot of the blame in the Russian defeat on the Spassky's genteelness with an ungentlemanly opponent.<br />Some of the background asides seemed real basic. I don't really need speculation on the possible Freudian implications of Fischer's psychology for example.<br />What was really lacking for me, however was depth into the chess. Many people will read this book with no exposure to chess and I don't think enough is done hear to communicate the beauty of the games which were played and how the protagonists personalities played out on the chess board. At the very least, it would have been tremendously helpful to have the moves for all the games in an appendix for those who wanted to see the chess.<br />I enjoyed the story but felt that these were two reporters doing a job that one reporter and a thorough chess historian could have done so much better.<br />Read it and enjoy it because it's the best material on a fascinating story, but pray that an even better history of this match comes out when Spassky releases his autobiography.<br />3.5 stars.	2004-04-11
US	43881833	RAIPXOIP7BAIV	0375712925	70225414	The Emperor of Ocean Park	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Provactive, flawed, worthwhile read	This is a book that really meets my needs for intelligent entertainment. I'm really crushed by the lack of major black male authors doing great work or finding success in getting the promotion or opportunity to publish a great work when they create one. I'm not going to elevate Carter to next great black novelist and I'm not sure he's even attempting to be one with this mystery thriller novel. He does, however, manage to create an entertaining, though overlong, book that raises some interesting issues.<br />Most black convservatives fail to engage me critically or intellectually. Through the veil of fiction, Carter is able to get to my listen to the positions and specualtions of his character on the delicacies of the position of the black elites and to bear his attacks on liberals and affirmative action. There were a few lines that were laugh out loud funny in his jabs and digs at the conventional views of many blacks who are left of center and some of the institutions of the black middle class.<br />The engagement with the law and the role of the law in this book is fascinating to me. You get a unique perspective on what the inside of a law school could be like and what machinations can be behind career making in Washington.<br />The actual conspiracy of the novel and the author's seach grew overlong at times. I wasn't totally dissatisfied by the ending but the feints and misdirections were more entertaining than the actual conclusions. I give him credit for genuinely shocking me at times with revelations in the plot, however.<br />I was also very interested in the whole flawed marriage angle. A marriage born of adultery and the permanent fissures that result.<br />I enjoyed the writing style as well and appreciated the chess angle.<br />Perhaps Tal is more worthy of the author than the protagonist. Tal was a chess player who had an amazing mind and was the master of the dazzling combination. It brought him flashes of brilliance, acknowledgement of genius, but not the lasting success of those who had safer more methodical styles.<br />I feel that Carter has written a book with strong tactical elements but that has some flawed strategy especially as you get to the last 100 pages of the book are so.<br />Nevertheless, this is an worthwhile for squatters' rights on some unclaimed turf in black fictions and the insights and creativity in its author in achieving man of his aims.<br />Give it 20 pages or so to see if you're intrigued and you'll probably find yourself wanting more.<br />4 starst the lasting success of those who had safer more methodical styles.<br />I feel that Carter has written a book with strong tactical elements but that has some flawed strategy especially as you get to the last 100 pages of the book are so. <br />Nevertheless, this is an worthwhile for squatters' rights on some unclaimed turf in black fictions and the insights and creativity in its author in achieving man of his aims.<br />Give it 20 pages or so to see if you're intrigued and you'll probably find yourself wanting more.<br />4 stars	2004-04-11

The prose is very readable and there were several great stories. I enjoyed the one where they crash a games party at Princeton University especially. I also liked the vignettes on the history of each of the pieces. Many chess players play the game, but it's nice to have some background on how the modern game arrived at where it is today. This book is also unique in that most chess histories tend to focus on the major charismatic figures of the game. Yeah, Fischer is mentioned a little bit the travelogue aspects place a greater emphasis on how chess is experienced in the present.<br />This book falters a little big in its big theme, a visit to the Republic of Kalmykia, which is organized around a dictator's desire to make chess the driving theme of his republic. This was an interesting idea but I feel the author didn't focus enough of my attention on this story. An even greater flaw was the emphasis on the official version of Kalmykia's chess story. He spent a lot of time walking around Kalymykia and waiting for the dictator to grant him an official interview, but far less interviewing the experience of the everyday Kalmykian. I learned a little bit about FIDE, the international chess organization that Kirstan [the dictator] heads, however.<br />There aren't that many readable chess books out on the market so this has the advantage of squatter's rights to me. I'd recommend &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; before this and this book as a follow up to getting a flavor of some of how chess is experienced today.<br />3.5 stars.	2004-03-27
US	43881833	R1XVSDUEA4R3AP	0634037935	853514881	Hard Bop Academy	Books	5	16	17	N	N	Art Blakey's band from the fanatic's perspective	I'm a drummer and I love Art Blakey so I've got to encourage people to check this book out. This is written from a fan's perspective and provides brief 2-3 page snapshots of all the major players who have played with Art Blakey's jazz messengers from their inception to his passing. He makes no bones about being biased. The author reveres Blakey and his contribuitions and emphasizes Blakey's sidemen to try to turn people onto the band and the music they made.<br />Blakey was one of the real warriors of the music and his band gave us so many wonderful musicians. The best recommendation for this book is that so many Messengers came out to support this project with interviews and stories about the band and about their relationship with Blakey. Blakey inspires worship, awe, and fear as a musician and a man and that comes through in this book. You do learn a litte bit about some lesser known figures [I'd forgotten Keith Jarrett, Kenny Garrett, and Joanne Brackeen were Messengers] in the band's history.<br />Mostly this is a great, fun, readable way to learn about the musicians and the leader behind the most legendary long term small group in the history of jazz. I'd recommend this first to fellow drummers, people with a knowledge and interest in small group jazz, and to those listeners who have heard classic albums like &quot;Moanin'&quot;, &quot;A Night at Birdland&quot; [w/Clifford Brown], &quot;Free for All&quot;, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and want to put some flesh and meat on the music they heard.<br />Great man, fun book<br />5 stars!	2004-02-24
US	43881833	R5COBTF3IMSPG	0425188485	885043753	Seventh Heaven	Books	3	51	53	N	N	Decent portrayal of suburbia from a feminist perspective.	I was recommended Hoffman by my sister and decided to check out what she is about. A smidge of magic realism mixed with a portrayal of a community and the characters that comprise it. As a man who holds some distaste and disdain for my suburban roots, I enjoyed the pinpricks at the balloon of suburban conformity. I was also genuinely surprised by this book at points, especially in the Ace/Nora axis.<br />I was not fully satisfied with this book, but I feel that any dissatisfaction reflects my own situation more than the authors' failure to achieve her aims. The change agents in this book are women who throw off the shackles of an imprisoning 50s ideal of woman and the children these women have birthed. The men in this book do not grow in the same kind of ways.<br />I may read more Hoffman to develop a greater understanding of her work. I feel that I have read a good book but I may not be the intended audience for it.	2003-07-05

Szwed writes engaging prose and keeps things moving along throughout while writing in a good voice for this type of thing. Chambers book seems to be better researched,though,  and it seems that Szwed relies heavily on secondary sources and the Troupe interviews with Miles Davis from the 80s. Personally, I distrust some of Miles' comments on his art from the 80s as he was heavily wrapped up in a star persona by that point. I felt the book was stronger on the bop period and the 60s and seemed to rush headlong through the 80s. This is kind of a pity because Szwed's is the only biography written since Miles' death and more interpretation and a stronger stance on Miles' later period would be illuminating for this contraversial period in his art.<br />The book seems to be written more for those interested in miles the artist and miles the man than miles the musician. There is not too much musical analysis, and I didn't have too much of a problem with that.<br />Chambers book goes into greater detail and is still my first recommendation for those seriously interested in Miles, but this can be a good intro and will definitely give folks a greater sense of this powerful figure of jazz.	2003-07-05

I've seen Fred Wesley live playing with Maceo Parker and the JB horns. He's down with the funk and he's been everywhere and seen everything. JB, Maceo, Ike and Tina Turner, LA and trying to make it playing an acoustic instrument soulfully in an age of production. The great thing about this book is that Fred seems to write with a minimal agenda. He's not a charting artist who's trying to magnify his own star, he just lays it down honestly. Anybody down with James Brown will gain from his insights on why musicians stuck through and put up with James' abuse and degradation.<br />Surprises for me were the tales of Count Basie and his life in LA. I didn't realize that he had overcome so much personal stuff by the time that I had seen him. This is a very readable insightful book that I recommend without qualification to anybody interested in funk. Let's hope Fred gets his due and we get more books from the perspectives of the musicians that make the music we love happen.	2003-06-22

I thoroughly disagree with ... who compared this book to Rickey Vincent's book, which is also pretty good. Vincent's book is intended as a philosophical and historical book, pointing toward an Afrocentric view of funk as a philosophy/borderline religion. Very ambititous and worth reading. Thompson's book more than fulfills its intentions, which is to be a thorough reference for funk. It's got great biographical summaries on many groups, and it also gives balanced reviews of the key albums and shows evidence of being thoroughly researched. Also, you get a sense of the author's biases, which are inevitable in any CD review guide written by one or two authors [think Penguin Guide to Jazz for example]. After the classic funk bands [George Clinton, Kool & the Gang, James Brown, Earth Wind & Fire] Thompson's more likely to get heavy into electrofunk. This is cool, but was not as helpful for me as I'm more into acoustic funk after the biggies. Meaning that a lot of New Orleans funk compilations and soul funk compilations slip under the radar.<br />One of the biggest helpful things about this book, however, if you're into hip-hop is that it lists many of the key tracks with sampled singles by a particular artist. As someone growing from a love of The Funk to building a hip-hop collection, that aspect pointed me toward a lot of the great CDs from the glory age of hip-hop before the industry made sampling the classics prohibitively expensive.<br />All in all this is a great reference for funk, certainly the best out there on the market [better than All Music Guide] and worth picking up if you're looking for a thorough reference for funk.	2003-03-16
