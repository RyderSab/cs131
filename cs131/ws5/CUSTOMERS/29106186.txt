Tolkien Created a New Mythology	Books	5	17	22	N	N	A fine book about a great writer	Tom Shippey is a profound student of Tolkien with a deep love of middle-earth and a deep understanding of it and its origins. <br />Unlike so many academics, he is a fine writer. He has style, insight and erudition. Professor Shippey succeeded to Tolkien's chair at Oxford and he has the feeling of Tolkien's world in his bones. He knows Tolkien not only as a fantasist but also as a philologist and understands - and can explain in simple and lucid language - how Tolkien's studies of words influenced his creative work. He has also written interesting critiques of science-fiction.<br />This is a most valuable book that will contribute proufoundly to any reader's understanding and appreciation of Tolkien's greatness without - and this is very important! - destroying the magic.<br />I know Tolkien's work well and cannot fault this book.	2004-07-04

But, and also like most Aussies, I know it's the best, most successful, most intelligent, most humane, most cultured and most admirable society on Earth, the true beacon of human achievement and the light and inspiration of the world. Yes, for all its faults which I know all about.<br />I am, it is true, half British. Modern British envy of America saddens me, as the envy-and-nihilism-intoxicated ravings of the loathsome, freakish Margaret Drabble and Harold Pinter and their likes fill me with utter disgust and shame.<br />As an Aussie, I, like most people in the developed world, owe my high standard of living directly of America and I know it. Not only because of American inventiveness and marketing. Nott only because America saved our bacon in world War II and ronald Reagan saved us from the threat of nuclear annhilation more recently.  The American alliance allows us to keep our defence spending down to 2% of GDP. We loaf at America's expence, let it pay for two-thirds of our security, resent it, and scream for help when we're in trouble. We're not as bad, not as envy and inferiority consumed, not as neurotic and self-hating, as the French and Germans, but we could be a lot better, and yes, more grateful.<br />The Poles and people in Eastern Europe don't hate America. Their liberation by America is close enough in time for them still to remember it.<br />One word of advice to Americans: You are loved, you are admired, by people all over the globe. Don't forget your friends, and perhaps give them a bigger word of praise than you sometimes have in the past. America attracts more resentment because its culture tends not to acknowledge its friends than for perhaps anything else.<br />Read this book to understand one of the most dangerous, sick and disgusting pathologies in the world, and help do something to stop it.<br />God Bless America!	2004-06-12

This is a wonderful collection of humor for the INTELLIGENT. <br />It is queer that people knock America as a philistine culture when only America has produced this wonderful visual poet of the humor of science. <br />No other English-speaking country has anyone to touch it, though in the print medium the British Daily Telegraph's columnist \\"Peter Simple\\" and his books in a wild, strange way come close, showing a society and a world at once recognisable as our own yet transmogrified with a strange blend of wonder, laughter and anger. In Peter Simple, too, (Gary Larson Fans, please look up his books on Amazon and order them, you won't be disappointed!) we feel the same profund care for what trendies call \\"The Environment\\" and he calls \\"The Creation.\\"<br />Normally, when people say a book is for people with \\"open minds\\", the open minds is question are recepticles for garbage about the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, Twelth Planets, Astronauts in Ancient Sumeria and so on. Not this time. Gary Larson not only makes you laugh, he really makes you look at the world a bit differently.<br />There are too many favourites among the cartoons to list; the alien tripping over as it majectically descends from the space-ship? The vultures and the cow-boy? The cow poetry-readings? The shark's slide-show? The dung-beatles going visiting? The father summoning the Floating Head of Death? The rat in the singles bar? The wolf-kill group photograph? The boa-constrictor in the play-pen? The throwaway, almost reminiscent of the old master's Fall of Icarus (to be pretentious), of the stone-age scene with, near the bottom, Fred Flintstone sinking into the Le Brea tar pit?<br />Is there a message? Larson, thank goodness, avoids overt political preaching, and there's nothing party-political here. It can appeal to left or right, indeed it seems to transcend both. But somewhere, and it's fairly subtle and cumulative, a message comes through. <br />In the meantime, this collection is a treasure. Buy it, read it over and over. You'll never get tired of it and neither will your children.<br />Thank you, Gary Larson.	2004-06-12

I am more-or-less a libertarian, but if I had the power this is one of the small number of books I would make compulsory reading. A truly chilling warning - America elected this dreadful creature who threw away so much of President's Reagan's victory in the Cold War and brought the greatest office in the world into ridicule and disrepute, who let down America's defences just in time for the terrorist onslaught, and whose mental limitations are as terrifying as the essential baseness of his personality is disgusting, married to a woman in some ways even more grotesquely repulsive than himself. A liar, an irresponsible, incompetent fool, a sleazebag and a lot worse. It happened once that such an apalling person could be elected and re-elected, in the decadent days before 9/11, and it could happen again.

If the book's claims are not true, one wonders, why does Clinton not sue for libel? <BR>The author, entrusted with probably one of the most desperately responsible positions in the world, comes across as a man of exceptional character and integrity, faced with something foreign to, and beneath, his own moral frame of reference. Yet there is no schadenfreud or vindictiveness here, only a determination to tell what he saw. <BR>Clinton is revealed not only as a moral horror to whom the word &quot;integrity&quot; would be without the remotest meaning, but someone who the US should have indicted for dereliction of duty to an extent not far short of treason. <BR>By comparison Richard Nixon was an honest patriot.	2004-04-14

This book is in the great tradition of preserving the values of our civilization and making them available to the oppressed. <br />It is written in the spirit with which the British Navy worked against its own empire's financial interests and broke the slave-trade at sea, an act of aggressive liberation, or the spirit in which America saved South Korea from the nightmare of slavery which the Communists tried to force on it.

Funny, no-one writes books insulting Islam for some reason.<br />Christianity doesn't need me to defend it, but I'm offended that this book is being passed off as some sort of insight into history and theology when it is neither. It is garbage for the gulliable, or more precisely, for the half-educated and those who passed through school and university after history and theology ceased being taught there.<br />To quote another reviewer: &quot;Same old lies. Hardly any of this background is original. Most of it is derived from the fantasy-disguised-as-history work 'Holy blood, Holy Grail,' and the rest is cobbled from other bits of well-worn and risible muggests of esoteric and Gnostic conspiracy theories.&quot;<br />The Catholic Church is shown as brutal, repressive and murderous. I am not a Catholic, so I have no particular reason to take offense, except that all this untruth should be offensive to anyone, and I feel angry on behalf of the many good Catholics I know. Its attitude to Catholicism and Christianity is simply vicious bigotry.<br />Among the ludicrous historical errors presented as part of the factual back-ground are the alleged facts that the Divinity of Christ was invented by the Roman Emperor Constantine, and voted on at the Council of Nicea.<br />There is a claim the Church killed five million accused witches during the medieval period. This is also utterly, ludicrously false.<br />This is a frankly degenerate work - it is not even well-written as a suspense thriller - aiming to exploit the gulliability of the modern half-educated and its success is a depressing comment on the state of our civilization.	2004-02-22

So I'm writing this for those who know the film but not the book. There are some minor differences in plot, inevitably, but both Tolkien's Trilogy and the Peter Jackson movie trilogy are great. I REALLY great. After vast battles and perils the forces of good previal, and Middle-Earth is saved, but at a cost. Tolkien unfortunately, I think, cut the final chapter from this, which provides a satisfactorily epilogue. It can, however, be found in his collected work elsewhere. The book also contains valuable appendices, chronologies, notes on the languages of middle-earth, etc. It's hard to say more about something so well-known, but if you loved the film you ought to love the book, too. Incidentally, Hal GP Colebatch's book 'Return of the Heroes&quot;, which I have reviewed on its own page, gives an interesting and insightful socio-political analysis all Tolkienties should enjoy.	2003-12-28

I have just re-read it and am again awe-struck by just how good a writer Anderson was. The premise of the story is that the intelligence of everyone on Earth - humans and animals - trebles. There is chaos at first - no one wants to do dull but necessary jobs any more, animals rebel against being slaughtered, monkeys learn to use guns. There is a tragic love-story but the end is deeply satisfying. Anderson not only keeps the story pacing along, but, as always, can evoke awe and wonder, with some very pointed and poignant comments on the human condition. The book was written quite a while ago but is as fresh as ever. If you read no other science-fiction, read this!	2003-12-20

When I first read Hancock, immediately after the quite ludicrous Zacariah Sitchin, I thought he was onto someting interesting and original.

Unfortunately from there on it goes over the top with ridiculous claims, bad logic, wrong science and history, fractured arguments and a general descent in intellectual quality.

All are splendid. I don't want to draw comparisons, because they are all so good, and each in a different way, but the last two are perhaps the best - all are very definitely five star. They tell of the adventures of a family of little trolls in, mainly the forests of Finland but other places as well, including fairgrounds, theatres, and uninhabited islands, along with all sorts of other strange creatures such as hattifattners, fillyjonks, hemulens and astronomers. A perfect blend of adventure and domestic warmth, evoked by an endlessly original and imaginative writer, who knows \\"The Usefulness of Everything,\\" in a world slightly - not too much - transmogrified but still recognisable<br />Full of warmth, wit, wisdom and delight. They should probaby be read in order as the characters become more complicated as time goes on, but Finn Family Moomintroll is a great place to start.

Ronald Reagan did more than save the world we live in: he gave us in the 21 Century a new start. Thank you, Peter Robinson, for imparting these values (I came across your name searching the Larry Niven website and I'm glad I did). This is a superb book and I can't praise it too highly.

I visited the scenes of some of them in England, and was surprised at how geographically exact they are. The characters are real, the stories believeable, and, with the various illustrations by the author, they create a truely magic world. They are also books about how to do things. You can, for example. p[ick up quite a good education in sailing and seamanship from reading them, along with how to smelt gold, burn charcoal, survey tidal mudflats, and all manner of other things. Hal GP Colebatch's book, \\"Return of the Heroes,\\" which I have reviewed in its own page, sets out a good deal about Ransome, and among other things indicates some relationships between him and Tolkien.

Today we need the qualities of courage and determination against all odds that he projected, as well as his great vision of history. One can imagine how decisively he would have dealt with the war on terrorism had he been alive today. He combined valour and a high romantic vision of nobility and of the worth of our civilization's heritage with (most of the time) a firm foundation and framework of common sense and appreciation of what was and was not possible. Though he loved military pageantry he cared for humanity and did much more than most to save it in a dark Century. These speeches are an important part of the heritage of the besieged West, and a tool-kit to aid clear and decisive thinking in toubled and confusing times. The book deserves its high place on Amazon's sales list. Reading it is a tonic for the spirit. <br />Finally, reading great chunks of Churchill is the best thing for improving one's own English style that I know. His prose is a delight to read, and a painless lesson in the effective use of words.	2003-11-27

The chronicles of Narnia combines profoundly Christian values and implications with beautiful, witty and exciting stories by a great thinker, writer, scholar, teacher and man. Children's books don't get much, or any, better than this. Those who love these works, by the way, may find them discussed in detail (and may join the discussion) at the website \\"Into the Wardrobe\\", dedicated to CS Lewis. For those interested in the same general area of literature I would also recommend the recent \\"Return of the Heroes,@ by hal GP Colebatch.	2003-11-24

I have always loved \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" along with the rest of the Dr Suess books and it's great to see it back on the best-seller list. If you havn't read it, rush out and buy a copy now - and buy the Cat in the Hat and The Cat in the Hat comes Back at the same time!

It seems to me this is the work of a patriot of decent values who is shocked - with good reason - at what the Democrat Party has become with dreadful creatures like the perjurer, terrorist-appeaser and sex-maniac Clinton and his ilk. How could Americans elect a draft-dodger as commander-in-Chief of their armed forces? What a contrast to the party of Truman, or even the great American anti-totalitarian Labourist tradition epitomised by the AFL-CIO at its best! Of course in Australia we have had the same thing with a working-class party (I am a trade-union lawyer, by the way) taken over by freaks, weirdos, and counter-cultual nihilists who seem bent on wrecking civilized values. Today, in the new \\"clash of civilizations\\" they are just bizarre.Indeed looking at other English-speaking democracies like Britain, Canada, New Zealand, one can see the author of this book has identified a widespread and very serious political and cultural problem - the intellectual and moral decay and hi-jacking of formerly responsible and decent left-of-centre parties. The American Democrat Party, in my humble opinion, was once a very great party. I hope it will be again, and this is a guide-book in the right direction.	2003-11-24

Niven is a trained mathematician, and it makes the story more satisfying that the maths are worked out plausibly. It deserves its many awards for sheer non-stop inventiveness and action. The characters are plausible and fascinating, too. There is a website &quot;Known space&quot;, devoted to Niven's works, if anybody doesn't know, and a brilliant new book of the wars of humans and Kzin, The Wunder War, set in the same universe, published recently. There have been two sequels to &quot;Ringworld&quot; published and another due out soon.	2003-11-24

Exciting and realistic battles. The Kzinti are not all bad - paving the way, perhaps, for the human-kzin interfaces of Man-Kzin IX and X. The idea of the &quot;Zoo&quot; planet is full of possibilities. But the thing on the cover is not a Kzintosh! The artist should be drafted as a wiper on a Kzin battle-cruiser with a zzrou in his back until he learns better. The female Kzinrett is OK, I guess. Nice legs, anyway.	2003-11-01

I think that in defending Harry Potter some of the premises go too far but it is still interesting and an informative contribution. If it drives the reader to a dictionary to theological terms I see no harm in that, though personally as a very amateur theologian I had no trouble understanding it. I think it's a mistake to impute an esoteric theological message to the author.

Purporting to be a history of Australia it is filled with errors - beginning with the description of the settlement of Sydey cove on the dust-jacket. There is an absurd claim that a dingo fence can be seen from outer space, that there was slavery in Australia, that in 1931-32 Australia was close to civil war, a completely unsourced and baseless claim Australian troops tried to surrender en masse at Gallipoli, etc. That's just for starters and before we even start on the author's personal bias any mythologising. The account of the dismissal of the Whitlam Government is the sort of thing that gives paranoia a bad name. It is claimed the Catholic activist BA Santamaria, one of the best-known figures in contemporary Australia, was expelled from the Labor Party - he could not have been expelled from it as he was never a member of it. Sloppy rersearch, bad history, a contempt for, or indifference to, truth and fact. The book is worthy of Manning Clark.	2003-10-08

These four stories - adding up to about 140,000 words - mainly about the first Man-Kzin war and the Kzin conquest and decades-long occupation of the peaceful human colony world of Wunderland and what it does to the humans and kzin concerned - are teriffic.<BR>\\"One War for Wunderland\\", the first and longest, is the \\"War and Peace\\" of the series, with something that's not been wrtiiten about earlier - a big Man-Kzin set-piece battle. The story is narrated by Nils Rykermann, a biologist, who features also is two of the other stories.<BR>\\"The Corporal in the Caves\\" is set years later, with the Kzin rooting out the human resistance in the great caves of Wunderland. Like one or two scenes in \\"One War for Wunderland\\", the last word in this one, when I read it and realised what had actually happened, moved me to tears, the first time a book has one that for a long while.<BR>\\"Music Box\\" is set near the end of the war. There is also a cross-conflict between the humans and kzin who want peace and those on both sides who want the war fought to the bitter end. Also some humans -and kzin - are beginning to change sides. There is a good bit of humor in this one too, as when a terrible-looking but actually relatively kindly old Kzin warrior, Raargh, wakes up a sleeping woman to whom he must deliver a message and to spare her modesty as she wakes and sits up tells her: \\"No need to cover teets. Raargh has seen before.\\" The last scene is quite hilarious and a relief from a lot of the tension and tragedy earlier. These are real characters whose fates you care about.<BR>\\"Peter Robinson\\" is set many years later, in the time of Ringworld, and is a sort of Gothic horror-story in space.<br />Incidentally, \\"His Sergeant's  Honour\\" in Man-Kzin IX, seems to occurr between the first two and the last two stories in this volume, which are otherwise in chronological order.<BR>I'm really drawn into the saga now and can't wait to see what happens next!	2003-08-03
