In this case, the crisis is the growing gap in revolutionary military capabilities between the United States and its NATO allies as described in 1999 by David Gompert, Richard Kugler and Martin Libicki. And, I argue, had the prescriptions for addressing this challenge been followed at the time, there would have been less political separation between the U.S. and its allies in the UN Security Council in the run-up to Operation Iraqi Freedom.<br />The authors write with the authority of top-level national security leaders and analysts. At the time, Gompert was a VP at the distinguished RAND Corporation, and Libicki worked there as a senior policy analyst after a previous posting at National Defense University. Kugler is a research professor with the Institute for National Strategic Studies at NDU.<br />\\"Mind the Gap\\" argues that the \\"United States is moving not only at a different velocity but also in a different direction, with different priorities, based on a different philosophy than its allies in modernizing its forces to exploit new technology.\\" The authors assess this situation (Chapter 1), and put forth a \\"four-tier\\" solution to the problem (Chapters 2-5). Chapter 6 concludes with prescriptions for the roles of national governments, military services, NATO, principles of collaboration and establishing practical ways to do this.<br />The \\"first tier\\" gives a broad view of international security interests to which the United States and most European countries ought to be able to subscribe. The \\"second tier\\" expresses how the NATO allies should work toward an agreed view of the most critical operational military challenges and requirements. To the extent that political authorities can forge a shared strategic outlook, the \\"ability of militaries to play their role will be enhanced.\\"<br />The \\"third tier\\" gets into detail that explains how effective coalition building can be facilitated by development of a combined military technological infrastructure -- one based on C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. The \\"fourth tier\\" discussion centers on how to accomplish the practical matter of pursuing a common goal in revolution in military affairs capabilities on both sides of the Atlantic. This, the authors argue can be facilitated by open market competition in information technology.<br />Despite the successes of U.S.-led coalitions and alliances in wars since \\"Mind the Gap\\" was written (Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq), the problem described between its pages persists. Now, with the U.S. Defense Department embarked on a major effort to further transform capabilities, the gap will continue to widen.<br />In the short term, this may not impose very severe penalties, at least as far as battlefield successes are concerned. But we have already seen a widening of the political gap between some NATO allies and the United States. Should both gaps be allowed to continue to expand, we are left with the possibility of considering the U.S. role as not only the world's chief of police, but as the world's policeman as well.<br />Coalitions are a critical element to military successes, and an equally critical dimension of political achievement. This book shows one way to address the former challenge, and by extension, helps to show a way shore up the latter.	2003-05-25

It gives intriguing hints at the nature of top level Chinese decision-making processes. It contains excellent biographical sketches of top leadership in the Chinese Communist Party -- new and old. And it reveals relationships among the various players that is invaluable in attempting to fathom the workings of a secretive government that sees its relationship with the United States as the core of its foreign policy.<br />Even with insider information (the secret files), it is always risky business to predict the future, and authors Andrew Nathan and Bruce Gilley are surly aware of this. The fact that they got most of their predictions right isn't as important as examining the ones they got wrong, and trying to figure out what may have happened.<br />Jiang Zemin stepped down as general secretary and president -- as predicted -- but stayed on as chairman of the powerful Centeral Military Commission. This event was not foreseen. What happened?<br />Nathan and Gilley forecast that the Standing Committee of the Politburo would consist of seven members. That group today stands at nine. (The PRC constitution allows for seven to nine members on the PBSC.) <br />One of the seven predicted to attain Standing Committee status, Li Ruihuan, was not chosen. Li, a reform-minded member of the previous Standing Committee, didn't make the cut for this one, even though he would have been young enough to serve another term before \\"mandatory\\" retirement at age 70. Credit Jiang Zemin for his ouster.<br />Three unexpected members were chosen -- Huang Ju, Jia Qinglin, and Wu Guanzheng. Nathan and Gilley discuss these men (and many others) as well as the leaders they predicted would rise to power.<br />There are brighter red stars than Huang Ju. Jiang has mentored him since Shanghai days in the 1980s. A former mayor and party chief of Shanghai, his daughter is married to a pro-Taiwan newspaperman from San Francisco.<br />Jia Qingling, a former Beijing party chief, was the best man at Jiang's wedding, and saved by Jiang after a corruption scandal involving Jia's wife.<br />Wu Guanzheng is secretary of the important Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC. An ally of Jiang, he has close links with Hu Jintao as well.<br />The new members of the PBSC that were correctly predicted by Nathan and Gilley are:<br />Hu Jintao, Mr. \\"Zero Defects\\" is China's first \\"resume president.\\" Hu used force in Tibet in 1989 two months before Tiananmin, creating the precedent for the June 4 massacre. Jiang labeled him the \\"core of the fourth generation.\\"<br />Wen Jiabao is a protégé of Zhu Rongji and supported by anti-Jiang factions. As premier of the State Council, he will oversee economic reforms. A capable administrator, he has been called \\"most dazzling.\\"<br />Wu Bangguo. A Jiang man from Shanghai days, Wu oversaw the Three Gorges dam project. He is said to have a \\"common touch\\" and is cautious about reform.<br />Zeng Qinghong has been mentored by and is the former personal secretary to Jiang Zemin. Zeng is perhaps the most influential member of the Standing Committee, and a possible challenger to Hu Jintao.<br />Li Changchun is supported by Jiang, but lost the premier's position because of purported missteps in Guangdong. Still, he was able to solve problems in the province and bring it in line with Beijing's policies in the 1990s, making it a favorite of Jiang and where he chose to announce his \\"Three Represents\\" campaign in 2000.<br />Luo Gan. Mr. \\"Go To\\" when there's trouble, Luo controls the security apparatus of PRC, including the People's Armed Police. He did Li Peng's bidding at Tiananmen.<br />At least seven of the nine are Jiang's men.<br />One of the interesting, if not amazing things that the authors show is that the succession to power of the \\"fourth generation\\" leadership in China is the most orderly transition of power in China's history. No small claim. Still, it remains to be seen how these men will govern and engage in foreign affairs.<br />None of the nine have any direct military experience. Only one has studied outside China (Luo Gan), and only one has had international travel (Hu Jintao). The preceeding leadership \\"traveled extensively, made diplomatic visits, attended summits, and entertained a ceaseless stream of visitors from abroad.\\"<br />To varying degrees each man is well-grounded in domestic policy, and they are poised to work together as a consensus team under the watchful eye of Jiang. As Nathan and Gilley point out, and as many China-watchers agree, \\"stability\\" will be a key word in making policy at home and abroad.<br />Last year, some of my Chinese colleagues in Beijing attempted to forecast the future too. \\"There are others besides Hu Jintao,\\" one high-ranking PLA officer told me. But he missed the mark more than \\"China's New Rulers\\" did.<br />If you're interested in the inner workings of the CCP, and the relationship between different levels and persons of power in Beijing, you'll appreciate the information this book conveys.	2003-05-25

Pitt is no stranger to war or the theater about which he writes, having served in both the European and Middle East theaters in World War II.<br />Pitt has done a through job of research and presents his findings in a clear, measured and very readable style. The reader is helped along through the use of numerous maps, descriptive sketches and photographs. An ample bibliography (notes for each chapter) and appendices (orders of battle for Operation Compass and Operation Battleaxe) tie things neatly together at the conclusion. At 332 pages, \\"Wavell's Command\\" has sufficient space for Pitt to explore the breadth and depth of the opening moves and initial battles of the North African campaigns.<br />In sum, throughout the first half of World War II, control of North Africa was strategically vital to the Allies, and after the fall of France it was the only theater in which the fight could be taken to the Axis powers. Pitt chronicles the events that lead up to and the successful routing of Italian forces. Then, in early 1941, General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps entered the conflict, and the smashing victory of the British against the Italians was overtaken by disaster.<br />In the end, one has to give credit to Cassell &amp; Co. for introducing all three volumes of their \\"Crucible of War\\" series on North African fighting-you won't want to buy one without purchasing the other two.	2002-01-09

Pitt is no stranger to war or the theater about which he writes, having served in both the European and Middle East theaters in World War II.<br />After the quick and unexpected fall of Tobruk on June 21, 1942, to a carefully orchestrated air and ground attack by Rommel's Afrika Korps, the German advance in North Africa once again threatened the British hold on Egypt and the Suez Canal. Churchill flew to Cairo on August 3, split the Middle East command by creating Eighth Army, relieved Auchinleck and Ritchie, and placed Gen. Harold Alexander in command of Middle East Command and Lt. Gen. Bernard L. Montgomery in command of Eighth Army. Throughout the remainder of 1942, Montgomery led his Eighth Army to successive victories against the Desert Fox.<br />Montgomery had his work cut out for him, but he and his men inflicted a defeat on German forces at Alam Halfa on September 7, and thereafter methodically pressed the Afrika Korps back toward El Alamein. Rommel, who could no longer hope to regain the offensive in North Africa, now found his forces practically surrounded at El Alamein. From October 23 to November 4 the battle raged, and when it was over the Axis had been decisively defeated, their losses staggering. It was a prelude to Allied landings farther west on November 8, and the success of Soviet forces against the German 6th Army at Stalingrad in February the following year.<br />Thoroughly researched and written in a delightful, fast-paced style, Pitt gives readers their money's worth. I came away from \\"Montgomery and Alamein\\" with a far better appreciation of the man who arguably was Britain's most irascible commander, but also the most successful. It was once said of Montgomery that he was \\"quick as a ferret; and about as likeable.\\" But in war there isn't room for nice guys. Montgomery knew that. <br />In the end, one has to give creditto Cassell &amp; Co. for introducing all three volumes of their \\"Crucible of War\\" series on North African fighting-you won't want to buy one without purchasing the other two.	2002-01-09

Highly readable, accurate and with well-researched detail, this definitive work brings the reader to the crucial battle of First Alamein in July 1941. Gen. Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps had consistently outfought the British since Rommel's appearance in theater in early 1941. However, thanks to Auchinleck's personal intervention at First Alamein, disaster was averted and Egypt remained in the hands of the British.<br />Although Auchinleck was forced into retirement after First Alamein, on June 20, 1943, he was back in the good graces of Winston Churchill and placed in command of the Indian Army.<br />In the end, one has to give credit to Cassell &amp; Co. for introducing all three volumes of their \\"Crucible of War\\" series on North African fighting-you won't want to buy one without purchasing the other two.	2002-01-09

In \\"Wars of National Liberation,\\" Daniel Moran sets out to change the way we think about many of the wars that have characterized the world stage since the end of World War II. \\"War since 1945,\\" he writes, is a \\"category that would have to disappear some day.\\" The title of this interesting and insightful history is Moran's candidate for a new categorization.<br />When I first glanced through this 224-page volume, I was struck by its thoroughness. Moran, whom I have heard speak at the Naval Postgraduate School where he is a professor, provides the reader with 23 illustrative maps, a convenient reference chronology from 1945 to 1975, biographical notes on key personalities, and a list of suggested further reading.<br />Space limitations preclude an in-depth examination of the wars Moran discusses, but his work is comprehensive. The major geographical areas featuring wars of national liberation in the 30-year span covered by Moran include China, Korea, Southeast Asia, Algeria, Africa and South Asia, Latin America, Israel, and Vietnam. Moran concludes with a brief discussion of historical wars in Afghanistan.<br />Moran points out that the term \\"national liberation\\" is a revolutionary slogan, \\"designed to conceal sordid truths. It served,\\" he continues, \\"to hurl back into the face of the oppressor the idea of the nation, which Europe invented, and the ideal of liberty, which the West cherishes above all others in politics, while deflecting attention from the methods and interests of the liberators themselves.\\"<br />Moran argues that while in some cases a war of national liberation has resulted in a new national identity where society lives in freedom, more often the result has been to replace one form of despotism with another. And the \\"liberator\\" of tomorrow may not necessarily have to find a former Western colonial power to take on.<br />Given the recent horrific events in the American homeland, this is a timely work. It is not for the reason of the War on Terror that\\"Wars of National Liberation\\" is timely, but for the inference one draws that wars of national liberation are likely to continue.<br />And where might the next such wars occur?<br />Present-day Palestine gives a clue. But one is forced to think more about those states, many artificially constructed by victorious powers in the West, that describe the Middle East, and from which al Qaeda and similar terrorist groups have drawn recruits and funding - funding from the very states whose governments may be toppled in the next \\"war of national liberation.\\"<br />This is an attractive book, replete with numerous photographs, and Moran presents his research well. It will be a good volume for the beginning and intermediate student of military history.	2002-01-08

In \\"North Korea: Through the Looking Glass,\\" they have combined their considerable intellectual talent and first-hand experience to craft a masterpiece of description, understanding and policy guidance.<br />This work is based on painstaking research and insightful analysis. There are charts and tables to support the author's findings, and there is an interesting picture section. Although it may seem a dauntingly dry read at first blush, it is in fact crisp and easily understood. Excerpts from two sections serve to illustrate.<br />In the preface, Oh and Hassig write: \\"Three years ago, when we first proposed to write this book, one of our colleagues sought to dissuade us on the grounds that North Korea would collapse before the book reached the printer. This was not an uncommon expectation in the years immediately following the 1994 death of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung. We had earlier predicted that his son and successor, the reclusive Kim Jong Il, would be unable to hold on to power for long. In any event, North Korea still survives, muddling along in a considerable weakened state. But even should North Korea collapse in the near future, we believe that a better understanding of the country and its people will help the world deal with a Korea struggling to reunify.\\"<br />On page 201, under the sub-heading \\"Policy Considerations,\\" we find: \\"The first goal of any responsible policy must be to avoid provoking conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Most of the people killed in a second Korean conflict would be Koreans in the North and South, and for a third party to trigger such a conflict would be unconscionable.\\"<br />And: \\"The second policy goal should be to provide the North Korean people with the opportunity to move toward democracy (a specific example of the avowed U.S. policy of promoting democracy abroad) by penetrating the illusions under which the North Korean elites and masses live. This simply means telling the truth to the North Korean people as much as possible. Since the Kim regime is built on lies and oppression, truth telling will go a long way toward defeating it.\\"<br />The chapter headings define the book's comprehensive focus:<br />1. Looking Backward (A historical and demographic appreciation.)<BR>2. The Power and Poverty of Ideology (Juche revealed.)<BR>3. The Turning Point Economy (Five decades of \\"plans,\\" and the economy continues to decline as debt rises.)<BR>4. The Leader, His Party, and His People (\\"Great Leader,\\" and \\"Dear Leader,\\" their personalities and grasp of reality, but \\"Nothing New under the Son.\\")<BR>5. The Military: Pillar of Society (Core truths, capabilities, strategy and social role.)<BR>6. Social Control (To \\"smash maneuvers by all class enemies,\\" and establish a \\"revolutionary law-abiding spirit.\\")<BR>7. The Foreign Relations of a Hermit Kingdom (Keeping its distance.)<BR>8. Dealing with the DPRK (The difficulties in closing the gap.)<br />Although it is doubtful that American leaders at the highest levels have read \\"North Korea,\\" it is a sure bet that some political and defense policy makers and senior advisers have done so. And it is these individuals, as well as the rest of us who wish to remain informed, for whom Oh and Hassig have prepared this well-crafted work.	2002-01-08

Gordon Chang doesn't say who, but he bluntly asserts that change--catastrophic change--is coming to the People's Republic of China in the next five to 10 years. His views are based on careful consideration of many facts, and he may be correct.<br />&quot;The Coming Collapse of China&quot; is written in a lively, journalistic style, and each chapter stands on its own as an interesting and insightful essay. The chapter titles themselves are intriguing, e.g., Lake of Gasoline, Future@China.Communism, Biting the Snakes, Highway Girls. And Chang, a U.S.-born Chinese who has lived and worked in China for nearly two decades, writes from his heart as well as his mind.<br />From my own travels in China, I have found that the Chinese Communist Party is increasingly challenged to remain relevant, particularly so as China has opened up in recent decades and enjoyed economic growth. Chang agrees, and forcefully makes the point that the Chinese experiment in reforming markets under central control could go terribly wrong. That would be catastrophic for China and a blow to its trading partners.<br />For one example, Chang points to Shanghai and the overbuilding that occurred there in the 1980s-1990s. Now, with occupancy rates as low as 30 percent (I have seen new, vacant office buildings there), and investment loans to repay, what's to be done? The central government can prop up only so many failed enterprises, and fewer once membership in the World Trade Organization is conferred.<br />Chang also cites acts of violence by unnamed groups--terrorist acts--which the CCP is reluctant to admit. The series of blasts that ripped through the heart of Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province in March 2001, and which officials blamed on a lone fugitive, Jin Ruchao, could not have been the work of one man, Chang asserts.<br />Does Chang see any hope for the future? Indeed he does. The penultimate chapter explores whetheror not the Chinese state can evolve. Informing us that most of the progress that China has enjoyed since 1978 has been the people's, not their government's, Chang quotes dissident Wei Jingsheng: &quot;The laws of history tell us that only when the old is gone can the new take its place.&quot;<br />This is not a position to be taken lightly, for the implications of change are profound, not only for China but for the region and the world. <br />Still, give the CCP and its recent leadership some credit. It was the &quot;four modernizations&quot; of Zhou Enlai and implemented by Deng Xiaoping that set China's economy rocketing forward by adjusting ideological precepts to mesh with free market economics. Jiang Zemin has also been active and effective in global outreach, and in presenting China's (and the CCP's) case before world leaders.<br />There are alternative views, some complementary to Chang's, and others less so. The great value of Chang's work is that he presents a position that is clearly at one extreme, and does so with a depth of knowledge and experience that can not be easily discounted. Extreme positions, of course, help to provide clarity to analysts who seek to compare various viewpoints and beliefs. In this regard, I found it instructive to revisit two other works: &quot;China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power&quot; by Nicholas Kristof and Cheryl WuDunn (Vintage Books, 1994), and &quot;China Debates the Future Security Environment&quot; by Michael Pillsbury (National Defense University Press, 2000).<br />Kristof and WuDunn provide ample supporting evidence to bolster Chang's thesis. Pillsbury presents an irony, which is that Chinese defense analysts calculate &quot;comprehensive national power&quot; and use this measure to show that the United States is in decline, which will lead to a multi-polar world in several decades and of which China will be one of five poles.<br />Chang's observations contrast with the behavior and attitudes of senior colonels in the People's Liberation Army who I count as colleagues. These &quot;Young Turks&quot; are making up for lost time. Increasingly well educated and with international travel and living experience, most remember the Cultural Revolution when they and their parents were sent into the countryside to &quot;till the night soil.&quot; A return to the past is not in their thinking. They have an enthusiasm for progress and for maintaining a balance and order in China, and regarding the central government it is they who will be the &quot;new&quot; that takes its place in the next five to 10 years.<br />In the final analysis, the question remains: Who will own China? For over 4,000 years Chinese emperors and dynasties have come and gone, and always change has been manifested by the strength of will of its people. That's your answer.<br />Postscript: Becki Hu was my seat mate on a trip to China a few years ago. Confident and assertive, she told me &quot;no one will own me,&quot; as she embarks on her future, and &quot;I may stay in the U.S., or go to Australia, or back to China.&quot; She recently completed two master's degree programs at a small college in Ohio, and returned to Shanghai to begin a career in information technology. After six months at home she was no longer so sure that her future there was as bright as she had thought. &quot;I seem to have been lost by China,&quot; she wrote.	2001-08-12

Along with the pictorial record is a concise history of the key events and battles.<br />&quot;Road to Berlin&quot; has a good map of the major advances by the Allies at the front of the book, but otherwise battle and campaign graphics are lacking. There is a bibliography, and throughout at the end of each chapter are explanatory notes.<br />The pictures and text cover Allied operations from the first toe hold on the Normandy beaches, through the build up, breakout, Operation Dragoon, offensives from the Seine to the Rhine, Arnhem (Operation Market Garden), clearing the Scheldt, the &quot;lull&quot; before Hitler's counter offensive in the Ardennes and the ensuing Ardennes battles, and the concluding offensives that crossed the Rhine and swept into Germany.<br />I found the historical discussion to be balanced overall, and not slanted toward a British point of view. Forty raises the controversy between Montgomery and Patton, but doesn't choose sides. &quot;Road to Berlin&quot; is an excellent survey of historical events, but don't expect a detailed recounting.<br />The beginning student of World War II in Europe will appreciate this volume, as will veterans who may want it to display on coffee tables. Unless, however, you happen to have served with the 82nd Airborne Division. The picture of Matthew B. Ridgway (commanding general of XVIII Airborne Corps) and James M. Gavin (commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division) has Gavin's name spelled &quot;Jones H. Canin.&quot; This is certainly not a fault of Forty's, but of a member of the editorial and production staff.	2001-01-24

At 240 pages, including a good index and bibliography, this shining little gem isn't a weighty tome. It does, however, contain sufficient detail to have depth, and ample illustrations (including battle diagrams, and side bar explanations of tactics) to be clear and understandable.<br />The challenge in preparing a book like this, that is relatively broad in scope, is where to draw the line at including detailed information, and where to move on. The authors have done a good job of this task. &quot;The Normandy Battles&quot; is a brisk read, yet full of interesting accounts, some of which are not commonly known and that add substance to the story. &quot;Hobart's Funnies&quot; is one example.<br />&quot;A great many odd devices were developed and perfected for the Normandy campaign,&quot; writes Simon Trew, and a number of these were formed into a special command of the British 79th Armoured Division under Major General P. C. S. Hobart. Tanks were adapted to perform such tasks as clearing minefields (the M4 Sherman &quot;Crab&quot;), and crossing soft, sandy beaches (the Churchill tank carried a bobbin of canvas that was unrolled in front of the tank as it moved forward).<br />The book begins with excellent background chapters, including discussion of the Third Reich, German forces and the allied build up. Key battles and operations are addressed, from the D-Day landings to the terrible slaughter of the Falaise pocket which is the concluding chapter in the book. Between these is discussed the difficulty of operations to sieze Caen, the tough fighting in the &quot;bocage&quot; countryside of Normany and much more.<br />Don't expect a lot of analysis, or statistical data for operations research -- that's not the point here. What you will find is solid, useful information, diagrams, explanations and pictures that show the nature of war. There are several photographs profoundly young German soldiers -- children, really -- a reminder to us all that war exacts a horrific price.<br />&quot;The Normandy Battles&quot; is for the beginning student, but I think the old pros will find it a good companion to other works on their shelves.	2001-01-22

A Book Before Its Time	It is disappointing to learn that Roger Warner's excellent work is now out of print. He and the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster did a national service in producing &quot;Back Fire: The CIA's Secret War in Laos and Its Link to the War in Vietnam.&quot; One can only hope that a softcover edition will be forthcoming.<br />Good history doesn't spring readily into public consciousness, no matter how well researched or written. The Vietnam War and related events still carry too much baggage for the American public to embrace easily ... perhaps in another generation this will change.<br />When attitudes do change (and they surely will), Warner's efforts to unravel and explain the events that transpired across Vietnam's western border in the 1960s and 1970s will provide a springboard to understanding and future research.<br />I found that &quot;Back Fire&quot; answered many questions about my own involvement in the war during those troubled times. One instance in particular that Warner recounts was the secret operation of a radar facility on a mountain in northern Laos, from which fighter bombers were vectored to targets in North Vietnam. The installation was destroyed in a desperate fight after outnumbered and unsupported defenders were overwhelmed by North Vietnamese regular troops. Later, not many miles away, a similar radar system was reestablished on a peak in the northern part of South Vietnam near the A Shau Valley. It too came under attack by enemy regulars and its defenders withdrew after a 23-day siege. (See Keith Nolan's &quot;Ripcord: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, Vietnam 1970.&quot;)<br />There are many key individuals that make up this intriguing tale. One of the most interesting is the charismatic Vang Pao, a Humong (or Meo) tribesman who rose from obscurity to lead the only effective Laotian army to fight the communists. Tragically for the Humong, when the U.S. sent combat troops to South Vietnam the CIA lost control of the air war in Laos. Subsequent mismanagement of air assets began the downward spiral of defeat for the tribesmen.<br />In the end, &quot;Back Fire&quot; is about more than just secrecy. It is about the cruel side of war and about war's illusions. It chronicles the sacrifices of small countries and naive, primitive groups to the hubris of more powerful neighbors and larger countries.<br />If you can get a copy of &quot;Back Fire,&quot; do so.

People in history are dealt with in a separate index, and include short biographical sketches of each. The index begins with Alvar Aalto, a French architect, and concludes with Vladimir Kosma Zworykin, a U.S. physicist. The book also has an extensive topical index.<br /> [the price]  may be a tad steep compared to other similar reference works, but its 318 pages are packed with information, easily read, and replete with pictures and map detail where necessary.	2000-12-08

With a summary introduction of warfare in antiquity, Perrett then begins the happy task of taking the reader from Teutoburger Wald (AD 9) to the ground battles to liberate Kuwait, February 24-28, 1991. In all, he covers 11 periods of military history and critically examines over 30 battles.<br />&quot;The Changing Face of Battle&quot; is well organized, the discussion of battles supported by excellent maps, graphics and pictures. Perrett provides a good index and detailed bibliography.<br />Perrett has a crisp style of writing and has a quantitative bent that lends solid credibility to his analysis. But his discussions of different battles have the qualitative feel of someone who has been there, or somewhere like it.<br />Most of the battles Perrett examines are ground combat actions, although there are a number of naval actions included (e.g., Spanish Armada, Trafalgar, Jutland, Midway). And, many of the battles explained are ones in which Britons fought.<br />This is a work that is worth adding to the military historian's reference shelf, and which is also a good read. It is a view of Western warfare (Asian battles and wars are not included) and how battle has changed in terms of the many factors that influence it.<br />I enjoyed &quot;The Changing Face of Battle,&quot; and recommend it to others.	2000-12-07

Based on historical fact, &quot;Last Full Measure&quot; also provides an insightful analysis of success and failure of both sides in the American Civil War.<br />After the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg, it becomes increasingly clear to Robert E. Lee that the South's devotion to its cause has become a desperate struggle. Yet he carries on, performing his duty, exercising his considerable tactical and operational skills on the battlefields of Virginia, believing that God's will shall determine the outcome.<br />The Union has a new commander, Ulysses Simpson Grant, a man who is willing to fight, who has the support of his president, who knows that success is &quot;only a matter of time.&quot; But Grant is hampered by a large army, incapable of moving as swiftly as his foe, and by subordinate commanders who either can not or will not coordinate their combat actions.<br />The war continues. Union forces press inexorably against the dwindling resources of the Confederacy. Capable Union commanders--Sheridan, Sherman--come to the fore, while the supply of competent Confederate commanders continues to shrink. In the end, both sides have given their last full measure of devotion, but it is the North's devotion to the cause of unity that prevails.<br />In a very real sense, author Jeff Shaara has given a full measure of his own devotion to his Pulitzer Prize winning father, Michael, who wrote the classic novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; about the battle at Gettysburg. Jeff Shaara's contributions of &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (the prequel) and &quot;Last Full Measure&quot; (the sequel) complete a three-volume set indispensable to any military historian's library.<br />In the final analysis, I found &quot;Last Full Measure&quot; to be the more thoughtful of the three works, although the other two are more exciting and fast-paced. It is onething to explore war's beginnings (&quot;Gods and Generals&quot;) or war's high points (&quot;The Killer Angels&quot;), but it is another matter entirely to examine the end of a bloody contest. Jeff Shaara imputes a somberness to the South and to Lee's command, a Christian fatalism--God's will is indeed being done, it is &quot;only a matter of time.&quot;	2000-11-25

Crowds at a park, population centers, sunlovers at a holiday beach ... all appear now as targets of bioterrorism. Even President Clinton has said such an &quot;event&quot; is likely in the next decade. It is not rhetoric.<br />Dr. Ken Alibek (Kanatjan Alibekov) and journalist Stephen Handelman have written a masterful, fast-paced account of Alibek's career as a leading Soviet bioweaponeer. Interspersed with vignettes about mishaps and disasters, &quot;Biohazard&quot; chronicles the Soviet Union's development of lethal biological weapons from the early days to the demise of Soviet communism. Alibek, who found he had no choice but to defect to the West in 1992, gives evidence that the world's largest (and one of the most secret) biological weapons program continues to this day.<br />Alibek should know. In the years leading to his defection he ran the Soviet biological weapons program and was deputy director of Biopreparat, the responsible agency. With 60,000 members and over 100 facilities, Biopreparat made startling breakthrough discoveries in deadly microbiology -- discoveries that even his Western debriefers found difficult to fathom at first.<br />Bioweaponeering work continues in Russia, Alibek contends. But what of those former Soviet microbiologists who have found other jobs with high pay from other foreign countries? As Alibek reports, &quot;The disastrous economic conditions in Russia have driven many of our brightest scientists and technicians to seek work wherever they can get it.&quot; There is &quot;lax security&quot; and it is easy to smuggle a vial of freeze-dried powder past an inattentive guard. &quot;Biological agents,&quot; Alibek says, &quot;are rumored to be circulating freely in the Russian criminal underworld.&quot;<br />In any event, the services of an ex-Biopreparat scientist &quot;would be a bargain at any price. The information he could provide would save months, perhaps years, of costly scientific research for any nation interested in developing, or improving, a biological warfare program.&quot; Alibek cites a number of his former colleagues who are now working abroad in such countries as Iraq and North Korea. He also points to meetings between Russian bioweaponeers and officials from Iran and China.<br />The recent spate of terrorist actions in the Mid-East give one pause. Although the preferred method of terror these days seems to be the suicidal use of explosives, it does not take a leap in logic to imagine biological weapons as a substitute.<br />The next time you're in a crowded shopping mall or sports complex, think about that.	2000-10-26

I only wish that the son had addressed Buford in his work.<br />I've walked the battlefields of Fredericksburg and the Wilderness. Jeff Shaara brings them to life, and tells a compelling tale of the principle actors on those bloody stages.<br />The religious fervor Shaara imputes to the commanders, particularly Jackson and Lee, is a commentary on the war fervor of the South in general. How could one fight to dissolve the Union without God on one's side?<br />If you have read &quot;Killer Angels&quot; then you must read &quot;Gods and Generals.&quot; If you have not, then read &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; first, then immediately go to the father's work.<br />Enjoy.	2000-10-24

I settled in comfortably with the first edition in 1969 on my way  to another war, and became thoroughly captivated by it. I'm delighted to  see it reprinted in softcover.<br />There are so many strong points to the  book, and too many exciting tales to capture easily in a short review. It  seems to me, though, that one of Brian Garfield's greatest strengths is his  ability to unravel and relate accurately the joint and combined nature of  allied operations in the Aleutians. The air, sea and ground operations,  which the book richly details, sometimes occured in isolation, but more  often were part of a concerted effort to oust the Japanese from the islands  of Attu and Kiska. Although the fighting was borne primarily by U.S.  forces, there were significant contributions by Canadian allies.<br />Then  there is the weather. The Aleutians, a chain of rugged islands stretching  from Dutch Harbor to Attu in the west, cover about 1,000 miles, and are  subject to some of the worst, most inhospitable weather conditions on the  planet. As much of Garfield's story is about fighting the elements as it is  about fighting the enemy. Having grown up in Alaska, I can easily identify  with the harshness of wind and storm, of cold and snow and freezing ocean  spray.<br />To sum up, in Garfield's words: &quot;The campaign in the grey and  windy Aleutians was the United States' first offensive campaign of World  War II -- the first to begin, the first to be won. Its major events had  included the first extensive aerial bombing campaign in American history;  the first mass military airlift ever executed; the longest and last classic  daylight surface battle in naval history; the first land-based American  bomber attacks on the Japanese homeland; and, in the Battle of Attu, the  U.S. Infantry's first amphibious island assault landingsand the second  most costly infantry battle of the Pacific war (in ratio to the size of the  forces engaged).&quot;<br />Garfield is as quantitative as he is qualitative,  something that helps give perspective to his gut-level reporting of events.  His footnotes are well organized by chapter and are in themselves worth  reading.<br />The only criticism I've ever heard was from a fellow who served  in the Aleutians as an engineer sergeant. He was on Engineer Hill on Attu  when Col. Yasuyo Yamasaki led his surviving soldiers in a banzai charge  against the American position. Yamasaki attacked up the fog-covered  Chichagof Valley with 600 men, all that was left of his force of 2,600. The  surprise attack almost succeeded, but &quot;Within minutes the Engineers  and service troops had sprung to arms. Cooks, litter bearers, roadbuilders,  and staff officers took shoulder-to-shoulder positions at the crest.  General Arnold borrowed an M-1 rifle and crawled to a high point from which  he could see the Japanese charging up the hill toward him. With calm,  precise hand signals he directed the hand-grenade throws of his hidden  troops as if he were calling artillery targets. The grenades blew gaps in  the Japanese line but the charge did not falter.&quot; The attacking  Japanese were within rock throwing distance when they were finally thrown  back by a &quot;withering point-blank concentration of bullets and grenades  from the hasty, improvised American line.&quot;<br />In this battle the former  engineer sergeant does not recall General Arnold's actions the same way  that Garfield relates them. Whichever is the case, it would not be the  first time an American GI disparaged in retrospect the behavior of a senior  officer.<br />&quot;The Thousand Mile War&quot; is excellent history and a  terrific read. I've enjoyed it more than once and have used it as a source  for lecture notes and other research. You won't be disappointed.	2000-08-13

Zalmay Khalilzad and company don't present anything new or earth shaking,  nor should they have since the purpose was to analyze and present  information useful to policy makers. It's a good Rand report, as most are,  and is a good reference -- reassuring to those who have spent time studying  the issues, and informative to those just embarking on careers as defense  analysts.<br />The central theme of &quot;The United States and a Rising  China&quot; is that our policy toward China should be a combination of the  current &quot;engagement&quot; approach and &quot;containment&quot; --  &quot;congagement&quot; is the term coined by the authors. This modified  engagement/containment approach recognizes China as a rising power, one  which will have a gross national product equivalent to the United States in  a few decades or so. It encourages continuation of enhanced economic,  political and cultural ties with China, but would be &quot;less solicitous  of Chinese sensitivities on such issues as human rights.&quot; The key to  success of such a policy would be to maintain a balance in the application  of its co-principles of engagement and containment.<br />&quot;The United  States and a Rising China&quot; covers these topics in some detail:  determinants of Chinese national security behavior (which I found of  interest); China's military modernization (which is a good summary, but  lacks depth); and U.S. policy options (which are worth a look).<br />Perhaps  most valuable is the analysis that looks at future military implications of  a more powerful China. It's not that they would pose a threat as a peer  competitor. Rather, China appears to be increasingly capable of projecting  power in a limited way around its peripheral areas while still maintaining  enough of a strategic capability to give caution.<br />So, the recommendation  of the authors is to continue engagement with China, but to also hedge our  bets against a future, possibly threatning regional power. The Rand  analysts look out only to 2015 in assessing military capabilities of China.  I found this a little bit of an analytical hedge, since Chinese analysts  themselves are looking out 20 to 30 years with respect to a true military  revolution in technological, doctrinal and organizational change; and the  U.S. Air Force itself has studied future military capabilities to 2025.	2000-08-06

Theory lets us comprehend rather than simply to apprehend.<br />In  &quot;Cultural Theory,&quot; Michael Thompson, Richard Ellis and the late  Aaron Wildavsky have taken a measurable step forward in understanding  sociocultural viability. They do not argue one or the other competiting  views of culture--i.e., mental products (values, beliefs, norms,  ideologies) vice the total way of life of a people. They focus on three  areas: cultural biases, social relations, and ways of life. The result is a  &quot;grid-group&quot; typology, which is at the heart of cultural  theory.<br />&quot;Group&quot; refers to the extent to which an individual is  incorporated into well defined units. &quot;Grid&quot; is the degree to  which an individual's life is circumscribed by externally imposed  perscriptions. These two dimensions of sociality are used to show the  relationship between five &quot;ways of life&quot; of people: hierarchy  (strong group/strong grid), egalitarianism (strong group/weak grid),  individualism (weak group/weak grid), fatalism (weak group/strong grid),  and autonomy (null group/null grid). The authors defend why these five ways  of life are the only viable ones.<br />&quot;The causal mechanism driving  cultural theory's predictions of who will want what, when and why,&quot;  the authors write, &quot;is that as people organize so they will  behave.&quot; It is the combination of the experience of well defined  social units (group) and the pervasiveness of rules which relate one person  to another on an ego-centered basis (grid) that leads people who organize  themselves in one of the viable ways of life to seek the objectives they  do.<br />&quot;Cultural Theory&quot; is not a quick read, nor should it be,  and it is not a work that most people will want to tackle, much less to  read and wax philosophic. But for those who are interested in human  factors--the &quot;soft factors&quot; in military models and simulations,  for example--&quot;Cultural Theory&quot; offers a portal of understanding  that is indispensable to further analysis.<br />One possible application of  cultural theory is to apply its constructs as a framework to understand the  frictions and conflicts between different groups in troubled states--places  where peacekeepers, the military and aid workers are likely to be sent, and  where a checklist to help organize operations to mitigate, respond and  recover from social disintegration would be helpful to senior leaders. Thus  it is possible that cultural theory could provide a starting point for real  world solutions to resolving conflict.	2000-08-05

This outstanding account of the first major battle between American and North Vietnamese forces in the Vietnam War tells in gut-wrenching, eye-watering detail what close combat is all about. Authors Hal Moore and  Joseph Galloway (Moore commanded the 1st Sqdn., 7th Cav., one of the two  squadrons involved; Galloway was a journalist on the ground with Moore)  have prepared a carefully researched, well documented account of U.S. and  North Vietnamese actions at Ia Drang Valley in the fall of 1965.  Importantly, they have drawn not just on American sources and their own  experiences, but on official and personal accounts of their former  enemies.<br />Ia Drang featured the new U.S. battlefield concept of  airmobility and the North Vietnamese decided to give battle in a desperate  attempt to find out the best way to deal with American helicopters and fire  power. When Lt. Col. Moore and the 450 troopers of his 1/7th Cav. air  assaulted into a small clearning in the Ia Drang Valley they were  immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese regulars. The fighting  that ensued consumed Moore's squadron. The enemy increased his forces and  applied even greater pressure on the Americans, and a sister unit, the  2/7th Cav., was chopped to ribbons. Enemy losses were extraordinarily high  ... a price they were willing to pay to learn the lessons that would serve  them on future battlefields.<br />The North Vietnamese did learn. They  adjusted their tactics and modernized and increased the number of rocket  propelled grenade launchers carried by infantry units. Additional heavy  machine guns and anti-aircraft weapons were laboriously brought down the Ho  Chi Minh Trail to beef up defenses in future operations. By summer 1970,  when a division of North Vietnamese soldiers surrounded airmobile troopers  of the 101st Airborne Division at Fire Support Base Ripcord, they were a  different enemy.<br />By 1970 the Vietnam War was a different war as well. In  1965 there was support forthe war at home and Moore's men went into Ia  Drang to win, and win they did. By 1970 U.S. forces were being withdrawn  and the ground war was being turned over to an increasingly capable South  Vietnamese military. At home, support for the war effort had waned terribly  and political will was lacking. U.S. units increasingly became  casualty-shy. Even so, the battle for FSB Ripcord (see Keith Nolan's  &quot;Ripcord: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, Vietnam 1970&quot;) was as  complex and deadly as that at Ia Drang. But in the end, the 1st Cavalry  Division held their ground and the 101st did not. A clear sign that the war  was, for all practical purposes, over.<br />Read Moore's and Galloway's book  ... give copies to friends and relatives ... it's a classic that will stand  the test of time. Then remember the words of A. E. Houseman after the  bloody struggles of World War One: &quot;Life is nothing much to lose, but  young men think it is ... and we were young.&quot;	2000-07-31

Its findings on military culture in the different services are as valid today as they were before the end of the Cold War ... perhaps  more so.<br />To understand the behavior of the military services, which  sometimes seems contradictory, it is necessary to delve into their cultural  make up. Builder does this with clarity and insight based on years of  intimate involvement as a defense analyst. The Air Force, for example, is  the embodiment of a single idea, one that also happens to be a strategy of  war. It is not love of the Air Force but love of flight and flying machines  that is the common bond of its members.<br />The Navy, writes Builder,  &quot;jealously guards its independence and is happiest when left  alone.&quot; It is perhaps the closest thing we have to a state within a  state. The Army, on the other hand, is schizophrenic, viewing itself on the  one hand as the loyal servant of the nation, but on the other hand the  &quot;heady memories of triumph in the closing months of World War II  contradict this modest role.&quot;<br />We are left to ponder how conditions  in the post-Cold War era, and particularly with the advance of technology,  will affect these cultural outlooks and service behavior. Will the Air  Force ever accept a pilotless cockpit in one of its planes? Will the Navy,  drawn closer to the littorals and within global reach of communications,  surrender some of its cherished independence? Will the stunning success of  ground forces in Operation Desert Storm supplant the glow of victory in  World War II for the schizophrenic Army?<br />&quot;The Masks of War&quot; is  a terrific study and a great read. But it does leave some questions begging  for answers. Builder does not explore the culture of the Marine Corps,  which comes under the Navy Department. Nor does Builder address the  distinct cultures of the reserve components, particularly Army National  Guard and the Air National Guard.<br />This is a great book for the beginning  defense analyst and the old pro alike.	2000-07-31

John Keegan is tops when it comes to history, and gives the reader  added value with his analysis. One doesn't have to agree with his findings  based on trends and patterns of history he's reported, but one is forced to  consider seriously the results he presents.<br />In &quot;The Price of  Admiralty,&quot; Keegan recounts the pinacle events of two naval  eras--Trafalgar at the height of wooden ships and sail; and Jutland at the  peak of iron ships and steam. He then delves into the two transformational  events leading to the next two eras of sea warfare--carrier-based air power  at Midway; and the advent of effective submarine operations in the Battle  of the Atlantic.<br />Describing the constriction of surface ships between the  &quot;upper pincer of the aircraft carrier and the lower of the  submarine,&quot; Keegan points to the future competition between carriers  and subs. Although it is not clear which platform will come to predominate  in the future, Keegan makes a strong argument that tomorrow's sea actions  will belong to the submarine.<br />There is rich detail among the pages of  &quot;The Price of Admiralty,&quot; and, like other Keegan masterpieces  (&quot;The Mask of Command,&quot; and &quot;The Face of Battle&quot;), this  work will stand the test of time.	2000-07-30

Pointing to the book on his desk, he  muttered about sacrificing our security for the sake of profit. I picked up  my copy at the very next bookstore. I wasn't disappointed.<br />Sherry Sontag  and her colleagues did a lot of spade work to uncover the stories about  Cold War submarine espionage that they did. Not all submariners and former  submariners were forthcoming, but enough were to provide ample detail for  the many exciting and dramatic stories in the book. I particularly enjoyed  accounts of Adm. Hyman G. Rickover's nuclear kingdom within the secret  recesses of the Navy. It's fascinating that a man could hold such power and  longevity simultaneously.<br />When Sontag and company take the reader deep  underwater, as they often do, the suspense is palpable and the pressure of  the deep becomes real. Tapping into underwater communications cables in  enemy waters while Soviet warships circle above is no mean feat.<br />Those  former members of &quot;the silent service&quot; who did grant interviews  for the book may have had an occasional axe to grind, but overall I found  &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; more history than compromise of national  security. It may be as close as we come to transparency when it comes to  the world's second oldest profession coupled with the most modern  technology. Enjoy.	2000-07-29
US	53009612	R218WNUH5295K7	0805057870	581888305	Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War	Books	5	36	40	N	N	(Wo)man Kills God	The original thinking that underlies this work should propel Barbara Ehrenreich to the fore of military and combat theorists of any era. Her thought provoking analysis in &quot;Blood Rites&quot; is a refreshing  challenge to conventional wisdom about the nature of war and fighting in  particular.<br />As a veteran of brutish infantry combat, I intuitively fell  in line with Ehrenreich's reasoning that man (or woman) did not spring  combat-capable from the woodlands and savannah of pre-historic times. Yet  something happened in the dark recesses of our cultural antiquity to cause  a fundamental change in the human psyche so that war and fighting became an  accepted norm.<br />The &quot;Beast&quot; is Ehrenreich's universal term for  the enemy--what we term the &quot;threat&quot; in today's military  parlance. The Beast--be it sabre tooth tiger or man-eating  shark--represented a deity. The Beast could kill early man at a whim;  likewise, the carrion of kills left behind by the Beast were also  sustenance for early human scavengers. Only a god can give and take  life.<br />Imagine, then, the cultural shock a society must have felt when,  finally, one of its members (or group led by one more able) managed to foil  the Beast's depredations and kill it. Once the giver and taker of life had  been slain by a human it must have seemed tantamount to killing god to  others in the society. And, the initiator of this act of ultimate rebellion  was very likely a woman.<br />Ehrenreich works through her ideas in great (and  sometimes laborious) detail. But the weight of evidence is compelling, and  her analysis is direct and forceful.<br />Although several years in print,  Ehrenreich's literary coin is as fresh as yesterday's mint mark.  &quot;Blood Rites&quot; should be read again for the first time by military  thinkers everywhere.	2000-07-27

As Tyler makes clear in  his concluding chapter, understanding the complexities of the U.S.-Chinese  relationship since the Communist victory in 1949 will be of critical  importance to the next U.S. administration, which will have to deal with  such key issues as Taiwan. &quot;A Great Wall&quot; makes an excellent  companion piece to Nicholas Kristof's and Sheryl WuDunn's &quot;China  Wakes&quot; (Vintage Books, 1994). I recommend this work to those with a  casual interest in China and to those who are just beginning their quest  for knowledge about the Sino-U.S. relationship.	2000-07-26
US	53009612	RA3ZTA1GIPECS	0304352640	708881656	The Art of War: War and Military Thought	Books	3	32	34	N	N	War-Lite	To echo the comments of reviewers &quot;wanchob&quot; and &quot;a reader from Israel,&quot; Martin Van Creveld has done exactly what he stated he would in presenting &quot;The Art of War.&quot; Long on breadth and short  on depth, this work touches on the ideas of the most well-known military  theorists in history. It is a good starting point for new students of  military history, and a convenient reference. I was pleased to see a  listing of notable military thinkers at the end of the book, as I was a  list of suggested further reading.<br />Once the reader has absorbed what  Creveld has to say, they may seek a more detailed analysis of war in, for  example, Donald Kagan's &quot;On the Origins of War&quot; (Anchor Books,  1995). For a discussion on a true theory of combat, a good companion work  is Trevor Dupuy's &quot;Understanding War: History and Theory of  Combat&quot; (Paragon House, 1987).	2000-07-26
US	53009612	R32KVUJ0NX76XH	0891416420	766302006	Ripcord: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, Vietnam 1970	Books	5	65	65	N	N	Heroism Was Commonplace	I've read most of Keith William Nolan's books, provided source information on two of them, and was a key participant in the Battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord. This obvious bias aside, &quot;Ripcord&quot; is Nolan's best  and most comprehensive Vietnam battle history.<br />Nolan is a master at  telling the soldier's part in the 23-day siege of this remote rain forest  mountain redoubt near the A Shau Valley. But it's not just a story about  the hardship and heroism of combat soldiers. He unravels and clearly  presents the challenges (and frustrations) of command from the division  level down to leadership at the squad and platoon level.<br />The Battle of  FSB Ripcord was a complex and deadly affair. One of two book-end battles of  the Vietnam War--the other was the airmobile action by the 1st Cavalry  Division at Ia Drang Valley in 1965--Ripcord pitted airmobile troopers of  the 3d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division against North Vietnamese regulars  that had surrounded the fire base in division strength. Nolan pulls no  punches in describing the action.<br />Quoting 1st Lt. Fred Edwards of the  326th Engineer Battalion, Nolan writes: &quot;I was returning to Ripcord  when I realized that the firebase was no longer an earthy brown, but almost  black. Mortar rounds had exploded on virtually every square foot of the  hill, charring it into a gray-black heap. It looked evil, malevolent. When  the helicopter landed, it was like being dropped into an absolute  hellhole.&quot;<br />Ripcord was more costly than the division action at Dong  Ap Bia (Hamburger Hill) the year prior. Because the Screaming Eagle  withdrawal from the base succeeded magnificently and did not turn into a  rout, the action went largely unreported at the time. Thus, many  participants in the battle had little idea of the depth or scope of the  overall combat in which they were so intimately involved. Nolan's book does  a great service to all these men by clarifying what went on and the  contributionsthey made individually and collectively to the division's  efforts.<br />Like most American military historians Nolan is more qualitative  than quantitative, more gut-level than analytical in his recounting of  events. Analytical comparisons can help with perspective. At the start of  the siege the average bomb tonage from air strikes against enemy positions  was less than 5 tons per day; but on the last three days the bomb tonage  climbed from 104 tons to 154 tons. Eighty-four fighter-bomber sorites  engaged the enemy in a 12-hour period on the final day. In the midst of  this cauldron of fire soldiers from both sides fought, died and struggled  for their very survival. Few came away unscathed.<br />This book is a must for  any serious student of the Vietnam War, and will be a worthy addition to  the bookshelves of military history buffs everywhere.	2000-07-15
US	53009612	R2LWFYV31JF378	1579060242	419841919	China Debates the Future Security Environment	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Old Friends, or New Enemies	The work of Michael Pillsbury has been almost as popular in Chinese military circles as it is in the United States. His previous report on Chinese views of future warfare was noted enthusiastically by Chinese  military scholars, although there was some concern over his liberal  reference to high ranking Chinese sources.<br />Nevertheless, Pillsbury was  able to return to drink from the same well in preparing China Debates the  Future Security Environment. His sources are highly placed and respected  members of China's security apparatus, and include members of leading think  tanks, such as the China Institute for International Studies, as well as  People's Liberation Army leadership.<br />The great value of the work is that  between its covers Pillsbury shows a comprehensive picture of Chinese  perspectives on a variety of topics relating to future security  environments. He explains contemporary Chinese Communist Party rationale  for viewing the future based on an amalagam of ancient Chinese statecraft  (views drawn from the Warring States Era, which many Chinese use to draw  comparisons with today's single superpower system) and current methodology  for calculating the comprehensive national power (CNP) of modern states.  The CNP of the United States will decline in the future, the Chinese are  required to believe, and their calculations go to some lengths to show this  pattern in various ways.<br />Most interesting to me was a discussion of  China's three views of future threats and how these relate to special  interest groups inside the PLA. People's War traditionalists are still the  most powerful bloc and control most budget decisions. Their future posits a  large enemy, such as the United States, Russia, India or a resurgent Japan.  Power projection advocates see the future differently in terms of local  wars around China's periphery. They advocate modernization, smaller and  more professional forces. The revolution in military affairs (RMA)  enthusiasts seeno immediate major threat for a number of years, time, they  say, to transform key parts of the military force to be technologically  competitive with the West.<br />There is a fourth future, explained in  Unrestricted Warfare, a book by two senior colonels in the PLA published  last year. It advocates removing all rules and restrictions in the conduct  of war to enable the &quot;inferior to defeat the superior.&quot; Available  too late for Pillsbury to consider in this work, Unrestricted Warfare may  represent a synthesis of views on the future way of war from a Chinese  perpective, even though it &quot;does not represent official  doctrine.&quot;<br />I commend Pillsbury's work to both the serious and casual  student of Chinese military affairs. He has done a service for those on  both sides of the Pacific.	2000-06-15
