Are you a CIO that is trying to educate your CEO and others? How much knowledge is really necessary for these people? These answers can be found in &lt;u>Defending the Digital Frontier: Practical Security for Management, 2nd Edition&lt;/u> by Jan Babiak, John Butters, and Mark W. Doll (2004, 253 Pages including appendices, John Wiley and Son, ISBN 0471680877) may be the book for you. Well written and easy to read, this book lays out an information security atlas to guide management in understanding that the overall responsibility for information security lies with them. The authors do, however, leave out an integral component of information security which management also needs to know and understand.<br /><br />The book is set out in tone and content to reflect the limited time a CEO may have. It tells what needs to be known and understood, in clear and concise language. Updated from the first edition to include recent results from the 2004 Global Information Security Survey conducted by Ernst & Young (the authors are all E&Y employees), the authors start out by discussing the \\"security gap\\" that has grown as companies move forward. Sometimes this advancement has involved \\"bleeding edge\\" technologies that increase risk to the enterprise. With this understanding, the authors clearly lay out the importance of IS security as part of a larger ecosystem. It is here they lay it on the line: IS security may, at least in part, be implemented by technology professionals, but overall responsibility is part of corporate security, which falls on the shoulders of the CEO.<br /><br />The authors are successful in discussing security characteristics, risks, the security frontier, creating a security culture, and creating a roadmap for success. They even do a very good job discussing cyber-insurance and the futility of buying it if an adequate risk assessment has not been carried out. But to this reader, the biggest failing of this book is the very scant attention paid to social engineering. In fact, the only real mention of it is a definition entry in the glossary. Given that this threat is one of the hardest to defend against and the fact that it needs to be addressed in any and all security discussions, the authors fail in delivering this key concept.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />This book should be read by CEOs, company presidents and company owners.

There has been a lot of uncertainty for auditors, and companies, as what is required and how to go about setting up an effective audit plan and making compliance  repeatable, sustainable reality. I have seen more calls of help for toolsets in this Listserv than I wish there were, but that has been the reality. However, there is now an outstanding resource to help external, internal auditors, and companies get their acts together by streamlining the 404 compliance process.<br /><br />Michael Ramos, author of the excellent \\"How to Comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404: Assessing the Effectiveness of Internal Control\\", has now written \\"The Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 Implementation Toolkit: Practice Aids for Managers and Auditors\\" (357 pages, John Wiley and Sons, 2005, ISBN 0471712256. This is not a book to sit down and read. This is a book that, from cover to cover, provides worksheets, sample documents, and decision criteria for their use. It is a book that comes with a CD-ROM of the entire documentation contents that will more than pay for itself from the first day you have it in your hands.<br /><br />It is hard to look at a book like this and say \\"I like or do not like what the author has to say\\", or that \\"I really like the author's writing style\\". What you need to look at in deciding whether or not to purchase this book, is a series of questions.<br /><br />Do you have to conduct Section 404 audits as part of an external audit or as part of a control self-assessment? Do you need ready to go and completely customizable templates to help you in this process? Do you want to use tools developed by an experienced Certified Public Accountant, instead of having to sit down and spend days on end developing your own toolsets and work paper templates? How much non-billable time are you willing to spend developing these tools? Do you want an easy to understand methodology that can easily be taught and passed on to other employees as part of a knowledge transfer and enablement program?<br /><br />If you are like me, these questions will give you the easy answer of \\"Yes!\\". All of the documents provided on the CD ROM are in word format, and the disk also contains a Microsoft Word document viewer and a copy of Open Office. Each form comes with a purpose statement to understand its use, as well as instructions on how to use them. Ramos starts with the general work program and takes the process all the way to the end with management reports. There is also a sample general audit program.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book<br /><br />The purchase of this book should be a no-brainer for internal and external auditors, managers, and consultants doing SarBox work.

The people must be incredibly naive, or they are so on top of all the possible threats that they really have no worry. I tend to think it is the former and recommend these people read &lt;strong>&lt;u>PC Pest Control&lt;/u>&lt;/strong> by Preston Gralla (O'Reilly, 284 pages, 2005, ISBN 0596009267). Digging a bit deeper into PC pests than the excellent &lt;strong>&lt;u>Internet Privacy Annoyances&lt;/u>&lt;/strong> (see related review), Gralla provides an excellent reference resource for people who are concerned about protecting their home networks and computers from intruders, malware, spyware and more.<br /><br />Laid out in a very easy to follow and easy to read format, Gralla walks the reader through various topics. These include the problems with web browsers, instant messaging, and phishing. He also takes the potentially novice reader on a tour of their computer to understand what vulnerabilities they may face. Occasionally, he throws in tidbits for computer users in the business world, such as a quote from IM Logic referring to an individual fired for their instant messaging conversations.<br /><br />Gralla will explain to you how viruses and trojans work. He will also teach you how to explore the Windows registry for hidden problems. But there is one glaring problem I have with the book. Throughout the book, Gralla throws around his personal opinions, such as \\"throw Internet Explorer out the window\\". While I, and others, may agree with his opinions, that have should not be written as flippantly as they are in a book from a technical publisher. He should have at least chosen his words more carefully so his views come across more objectively.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book<br /><br />This book really is for the novice, or naive, computer user. More experienced technical professionals might glean a few bits of wisdom but that is about all.

How many times have we heard the expression that \\"you are what you eat\\"? But what if that were extended to what you drive, what you read, where you work, what you spend, and much more. What if this information was being gathered by unknown people for uncertain purposes in digital format, would this \\"digital dossier\\", which might be used to make decisions about you, be accurate? Well they do exist and are assembled and used by people and groups that you may not even know about, even though the use may have a direct impact on your life.<br /><br />So you might then ask if existing legal frameworks provide any protection or recourse to keep a handle on the information? In The Digital Person: Technology and Privacy in the Information Age (2004, New York University Press, 282 Pages, ISBN 0814798462), George Washington University Law Professor and privacy law expert Daniel J. Solove weaves history, legal precedents, changes in society/technology, and discussions of practical business/marketing into a narrative that is not only easy to read and understand, but one that must be read by anybody who wants to discuss and understand privacy in a meaningful way.<br /><br />Solove, who also co-authored Information Privacy Law in 2003, starts out by laying the groundwork for the privacy discussion. He outlines how information databases came to be and how they have evolved. He then provides the basis for the metaphor he wants to present, showing that it is not the Orwellian world of 1984 we need to fear, but the world imagined by Kafka in The Trial that should be of concern to individuals. Having never read The Trial, I found this discussion to be fascinating and in some ways changed some of my thoughts on the issue, while reenforcing others.<br /><br />The meat of the book, which is built on his metaphor, is that current privacy laws in the United States have not kept up with technology, and that unless they are changed, individuals will continue to be helpless in controlling their information (which may or may not be private). As he points out, consumers are always at the wrong end of one-sided contracts when it comes to information surrounding their information. Acknowledging that the information genie is indeed out of the bottle, Solove hones in on discussions about what the laws need to address, but how this may not be so easy. The key is defining what is meant by \\"Secrecy\\" and \\"embarrassment\\". Also key is that the risks we face, given that so much of our lives is already catalogued, are the result of indifference or mistakes on the part of the people who hold the data. It is also the fact that this indifference and chances for error are magnified because there is no market or economic incentive for companies to have privacy policies that work for the consumer and have some teeth.<br /><br />He develops a framework for legal changes that centers on the 4th and 5th amendments of the constitution, providing examples how in some areas the courts have evolved as technologies change. But part of the challenge, as he points out, is the patchwork of laws in the United States that conflict, overlap, and in sone case are too inclusive in their implementation.<br /><br />It is unclear from this book how the changes he proposes can be accomplished. Consumers are not united enough and do not have deep enough pockets to fight for the change. If the book has only one shortcoming, it would in my opinion be lack of discussion of this imbalance. In light of this, it only rates 5 stars instead of 5++.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />This book should be read by anybody who wants to gain a solid foundation to understand and discuss privacy issues in a meaningful manner.<br /><br />The Scorecard<br /><br />A Double Eagle on a long Par 5 playing into the wind.g their information (which may or may not be private).

For many people, it may rank right down there with compliance. But the reality is that governance has been traditionally viewed as essential to corporate viability and survival. But the question is whether strong governance should be the end game, or the starting point for a new model. In Beyond Governance: Creating Corporate Value through Performance, Conformance and Responsibility (John Wiley and Sons, 2005, 336 pages), Martin Fahy, Jeremy Roche, and Anastasia Weiner argue that governance alone will not cut the mustard, and that a new model is needed.<br /><br />In this book, which should challenge most readers' conventional thinking, the authors set out to set governance on its ear. They do this by arguing that governance alone is not the answer, and that the new model needs to be built on performance, conformance, and corporate responsibility.  The succeed on many levels that, if their model is accurate, has many implications for companies, customers and vendors alike.<br /><br />What readers need to take from this book is that traditional roles such as finance and accounting have changed and are constantly evolving. For people in these professions, they need to understand this and adapt. For software vendors, the paradigm has to shift from one of lowering costs, because corporations are past that stage, and focus on how their products need to demonstrate how they add to strategic, integrated value. For Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and internal auditors, the authors discuss risk assessment and risk management at length.<br /><br />What I found most interesting is that the authors are writing what IBM and Lotus Software have been saying for going on 20 years now: collaboration and workflow are an essential cog in this model. In fact, as much as IBM has been criticized by Industry analysts and their own business partners for their Workplace strategy, it is clear from my reading of this book is that they \\"got it\\" a long time ago, and many of their competitors still do not \\"get it\\". Their challenge now is to clearly articulate it in relation to the model presented.<br /><br />I do not know if I was comfortable with the authors' discussion of corporate responsibility as it represents a very Euro-centric view of corporate responsibility through the promotion of sustainable economic development in the Third World. I am not saying I disagree with their views, it is just that this might be a harder sell in the United States.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />This book has many potential audiences who really should read it. CEOs, CFOs and CIOs should read it an embrace at least some of the concepts in their strategic thinking and planning. Internal and external auditors should read it to better understand the big picture. And finally, software vendors should read it to understand what they need to do and where they need to go to create strategic value with their products.<br /><br />The Scorecard<br /><br />An Eagle on a Long Par 5it is clear from my reading of this book is that they \\"got it\\" a long time ago, and many of their competitors still do not \\"get it\\".

It may take years for a company to build up this asset, but as companies such as ChoicePoint learned this past year, it can all be gone just like that. Their crime was that of giving away private information about people to a criminal engaged in identity theft, and they failed to notify anybody until they had to under a California Privacy law. But it can be a daunting challenge to get a firm grasp on how privacy should be implemented in the enterprise, as well as knowing what laws of what jurisdictions may be applicable. That is why \\"Privacy Handbook: Guidelines, Exposures, Policy Implementation, and International Issues\\" (Albert J. Marcella, Jr. and Carol Stucki, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, 384 Pages, ISBN 0470011513) needs to be on the bookshelves of any professional that takes<br /><br />privacy seriously.<br /><br />I will not kid you and say this is an easy read. There is an abundance of material to get through and grasp. In fact, I have read through it twice already and am sure i will be going back. Why, because of the complexity and nuances of dealing with the issue in a serious way. When the authors talk about trust, it hits many levels, impacting customers, employees, vendors, and third parties (such as the case with ChoicePoint).<br /><br />The authors start out discussing why privacy is important and then step by step walk the reader through how our notion of privacy has eroded over the years. They explain how it has happened through not only the passage of laws, but loopholes in the laws that are passed. They talk about how the Internet Explosion has had such an impact in ways most people may not comprehend. The authors take great pains to distinguish between privacy types, such as public information vs. non-public information.<br /><br />Then the fun starts, they provide an extensive, but not full, listing of privacy resources available to people, as well as a listing of various privacy statutes on the books or proposed in various countries around the world. This latter item is extremely important to businesses because they must be cognizant of the privacy laws where there customers, vendors, employees live. Note that this is constantly changing, so additional due diligence is required on the part of the reader.<br /><br />The other great strength of this book is that they walk you through the establishment and inclusion of privacy policies and standards, aligned to your business needs and objectives, as part of an overall security strategy for an organization. They acknowledge and discuss the barriers to success, but provide an excellent roadmap to make people successful.<br /><br />Even though the book was published in 2003, it does not mean it is obsolete. On the contrary, while the laws and sits referenced in the book may be changed, the underlying concepts and guidance have not. An added bonus is the companion website to the book, which contains an additional 35 appendices.

But what I had never given much thought to is that identity theft goes much beyond stealing identities for financial gain. In fact, what is much more difficult to deal with is when your identity is stolen and used by criminals in general. Try to clear a supposed criminal record. And if you are in the United States, try to do that if you are black or Hispanic. That is just part of the excellent discussions you will find in Bob Sullivan's Your Evil Twin: Behind the Identity Theft Epidemic (August 2004, John Wiley & Sons, 314 Pages, ISBN 0471648108).<br /><br />A journalist by training, Sullivan presents an easy to read, if unsettling, narrative talking about different aspects of identity theft that do not often get discussed. Some of the material is material found in magazines and other journals, but the strength of this book is that it beings many different pieces into one place. Sullivan starts out by showing that no one is immune to identity theft, whether it be a CEO or even Eldrick \\"Tiger\\" Woods. He goes into some detail explaining who was taken advantage of and how, though he does not offer solutions for the problems.<br /><br />But this does not mean he is afraid to take on the real villains in identity theft, the credit card companies and retailers who push easy credit every chance they get. Sullivan makes the excellent point that the availability of easy credit is actually better for the bad guys than those who do the right thing. He also does not shy away from calling out the credit reporting agencies and their role in this problem. Why should they be charging people for \\"Credit report watches\\", when they helped create the problem? It was fascinating from a historical perspective to read how the three major credit reporting companies came to be. It is a heck of a trivia question to ask how a railroad fits into the scheme of things.<br /><br />You will, or at least should, find yourself challenged by the reality that the race factor plays in how victims are treated. Like it or not, we live in two Americas as clearly shown in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Discussions of this topic in the book really offer a time for reflection and thought in the area of identity theft.<br /><br />One should not expect this book to answer every possible question about identity theft, but should be considered as part of a larger library on data privacy and identity theft.

Simon, is a definitive title on the art of social engineering that I consider to be a must read. The latest title by this duo, The Art of Intrusion (Mitnick and Simon, 288 Pages, J. Wiley, 2005, ISBN 0764569597) is now on this list as well. From the start, they provide real-life stories of intrusions in a way that can be easily understood by nontechnical readers, while at the same time provide a solid reference to explore more technical solutions to the threats illustrated. There are a few times that Mitnick seems to slip into an apologist role for hackers, but this is tempered by his simple advice that perhaps at times we should embrace hackers and what we can learn from them, instead of prosecuting them from the get go.<br /><br />What makes this book an excellent resource is that each chapter is a stand-alone incident that really happened. Through interviews with the participants, it is easy to read and understand what happened and what the threats really are. I find this important because it is one thing to talk (sometimes until you are blue in the face) about potential threats and the need to defend against them, it is another to read about real incidents and the aftermath. The story of the state prison inmates will either leave you in stitches or shocked at the inadequacy of prison security.<br /><br />In the book, there is an all important and true quote: \\"The adage is true that the security systems have to win every time, the attacker only has to win once\\". This quote is appropriate because like their first book, the authors take the time to explain each intrusion in detail. They then follow each one with specific recommendations as to how they could be defended against. One important thing I took from the book deals with penetration testing. Doing these tests is much like a companies balance sheet: it is only a snapshot in time of the current situation. You may pass this time, but it does not mean that you are safe in the future.<br /><br />This book really is a companion book to The Art of Deception, but it can stand alone. But if you take the lessons, policies and plans from the two books, you will be much better of than if you haven't. And who better to learn from then the original hacking \\"bad boy\\". Do not expect a deep technical read, because that is not what this book is about. It is about learning to crawl before you can walk.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />This book should be read by pretty much the same people who I recommended read The Art of Deception. This includes information security officers and consultants need to read this book so they can incorporate the lessons into their own best practices.

Perhaps one of the best known social engineers is Kevin Mitnick. He was a master of the game, that is until he was caught. Sent to prison, and barred from using computers and the Internet for years because of his actions, he emerged a reformed man and set out to educate companies and users how to best protect themselves. One of his efforts, in collaboration with William L. Simon, was the 2002 book entitled The Art of Deception (368 Pages, J. Wiley, ISBN 076454280X). Since I was getting ready to read his new book (The Art of Intrusion), I wanted to read and review this title first so I would have context for his stories. Without I doubt, I am glad I did and this book is now on my \\"must read\\" recommendations list.<br /><br />The reason this book needs to be read is because it was, and really remains, a definitive work on Social Engineering. Too many security consultants and businesses focus time and money in hardware and software solutions, when the reality is that social engineering is the tool that can make all of that worthless and for naught. As prevalent as it is in our everyday lives in good ways, it is often is not recognized and understood when being used by the \\"bad guys\\".<br /><br />Mitnick and Simon take the reader step by step through a number of scenarios which probably did happen. Not only do they lay out what was done, but they analyze how it was done and why it was successful. If that is enough, they also present recommendations on how to counter the attacks at the end of each chapter. They also cover a broad range of attacks from technical to just getting inside the doors.<br /><br />The greatest asset of this book, which more than makes the book pay for itself, is that fact that the authors include a complete training and security awareness program outline, AND sample security policies to address social engineering. Too many times, this is left out of the picture. With this book as a resource, it is a very easy task to include it in all awareness programs.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />Information security officers and consultants need to read this book and incorporate the lessons into their own best practices. CIOs and CEOs need to read this book, which is very readable, to understands the nature of the threat. Employees need to read this book to understand how vulnerable they are. Maybe they might say,\\"Hey that happened to me!\\".

How many times have you gone online to only get frustrated? Web sites do not work the way you think they should. How many times have you had problems with your computer or wireless connection, and have no idea why? Do you have a website and often wonder who is linking to you? Does your email client drive you batty? It is these things and more that drive Internet Annoyances (256 Pages, O'Reilly, 2005, ISBN 0596007353) by Preston Gralla.<br /><br />Laid out like a text book, Gralla attempts to cover a wide range of topics in a condensed space. For the most part, he succeeds. Where I get lost is that it is such a whirlwind that jumps from one topic to another, which can be disconcerting. But you know what? That's OK, because there is a lot to be aware of, especially as technology matures. The book satisfied my need to learn at least one new think from a book, and I learned a few. What did I learn? Extra ways to protect a wireless router that I was not aware of. I learned how to find hidden products on E-Bay (the book does not mention that sellers are also now taking advantage of this human error trick. Gralla also does a good job, at a high level, of covering pop-ups, spam, instant messaging and more.<br /><br />While this book is not on my \\"must read\\" recommendation list, you will not be disappointed if you buy it.

Boy, was I wrong. What I got was a extremely thorough discussion of identity management architectures within the context of information systems (IS) governance processes. This is the first time I have read a book that so thoroughly weaves technical discussions (at an appropriate level for the intended audience) with a full discussion of the IS governance frameworks that are essential to success when implementing an IMA. There is only one place where Phillip Windley, former CIO of the State of Utah, falls short in this book.<br /><br />Windley is up front in stating that management of digital identities is fundamental to success in information technology. He also makes it clear that the purpose of the book is not to show how to design and implement an IMA. It is about understanding IMAs in a business context. Windley also does an excellent job at showing why critics of digital rights management (DRM) (as enforced by the movie and record industries), are doing more of a disservice by framing the DRM dialog in the wrong context. A such, people are predisposed in their opinions whenever the discussion comes up in any context.<br /><br />Stating this up front, the reader of the book will walk through an explanation of what digital identity is, the concept of trust, the lifecycle of digital identity, and the business reasons for it. After laying the groundwork, as well as covering interoperability and federation of identity, the authors covers what really should be the best practices for any organization. By pulling from his own experiences he is able to substantiate that what he is saying is not just \\"theory\\". It is based on real experience.<br /><br />This is, however, the point where I feel the author's lack of full disclosure keeps the book from being even stronger than it is. In his struggle to bring strong IS governance to the state of Utah. You see the reality is that if you come into an organization like a bull in the china shop, you are going to make enemies. From what he is written in this book, this seems to be the style he employed when trying to unify the Utah information infrastructure. The result of this, that is not covered in the book, is that he was forced to resign as CIO under the cloud of an investigation of improper hiring practices. I believe that if he had included this information in the book, along with lessons learned, the book would have been truly outstanding. Because it wasn't, I have to knock it down to 4.5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />Note: In an e-mail exchange with the author, he indicated that although he strongly disagreed with what was in that report, his office never published a response to that report either formally or informally.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book<br /><br />This is usually where I write a list of specific job types who should read this book, but this time I want to approach it from a different angle.

Why do I say this? The bottom line reason is that the average Internet and Personal computer user need a simple, easy to follow reference guide to help them understand the threats to their privacy in the online and physical worlds. In fact, the book might better have been titled \\"Personal Privacy Annoyances\\", because the lessons extend beyond just the computer world. In fact, every ISP should hand this book out to their subscribers, new and old.<br /><br />Tynan does not waste any time getting to the point, discussing privacy issues at home, work, in the stores and on the streets. In plain English, he explains worms, spam, hackers and viruses in easy to understand wording. He explains what the threats are, where they come from and how to protect against them. He talks about HIPAA, the large number of organizations not in compliance, and the loopholes that put your health care information places where you may not want it to be, You will learn about airport security, and what little you can do about it.<br /><br />There is so much excellent material in this book, I could write forever. I think you can get a sense for my excitement about this book. Part of this excitement is tied to the layout. Unlike many O'Reilly (or other publishers) books which can be very dry in layout/presentation, this book is presented much like a college and/or school workbook. This makes it incredibly easy to read and follow. It is also much, much cheaper than many other technical books that offer less value.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />You. Your mother and father. Your In-laws. Your siblings. Your neighbors. Your ISP. Your pastor. Your childrens' teachers. Your barber. Your Doctor.

If you have undertaken efforts to protect your identity from theft, have you thought to check on the credit reports of your children? I certainly had not, but this is one of the hidden gems/tips in the just published How To Own an Identity (Raven Adler, Jay Beale, et al, Syngress Press, 2005, 450  Pages, ISBN 1597490067), the third book in Syngress' Stealing the Network series.<br /><br />While not the best book in the series (I believe the second book, How to Own A Continent, holds this distinction). But it is still a very good read, offering insights into how your identity is not only vulnerable to theft by individual hackers, but how these hackers may be just a pawn in larger attacks by organized crime and other groups. Like the first two books in the series, this book is presented as fiction laced with technical fact and education. The main characters are much the same, but you are given new insights and backstories about them.<br /><br />You may think you know a lot about social engineering, but this art form takes on new meaning and perspective when you read Chapter 6, \\"The Java Script Cafe\\". In fact this chapter provides a good back drop that leads to revelations on how a hacker might turn the tables on the very people they were trying to serve. The book may also make you think twice about how much the government may not be on your side in protecting you identity, whether it be by siding with the companies that buy and sell your information in the marketplace, or even some unnamed agencies that you think are working for you.<br /><br />It all makes for a very good read, but at the same time it does not flow together as well as the first two titles in the series. This may be a case of just too many authors contributing to one book, which is unfortunate. But it does not mean you should not read the book. It is an important topic to understand or at least try to.

When coupled with internal politics and Byzantine contracting rules, you may as well put a \\"kick me\\" sign on your back. Before the days we became dependent on computers and networking for everyday tasks, the risks were not as great. When terrorism is added to the formula, there has to be a recognition that the days of finger-pointing and excuses are no longer acceptable. In Zero-Day Exploit: Countdown to Darkness (339 Pages, Syngress Press, 2004, ISBN 1931836094), Rob Shein, David Litchfield, and Marcus Sachs present an account of one possible attack scenario.<br /><br />Like most fiction, you will have to ask yourself if the scenario in the book is possible at all. But the answer you give yourself may not be adequate. After all, who else except for the Able Danger team thought 9/11 was a real possibility?<br /><br />What makes this book different from others that I have read, the authors bring a real world perspective of Washington, DC politics and the challenges brought by the divide between employees and federal contractors, as well as what happens when people put their own career self-preservation above doing the right thing. Think this is not possible in today's environment? Think again. Having spent 12 years as a federal acquisition professional, I saw it every day, and I know what happens to people who buck the system.<br /><br />The book does get bogged down early with its detailed narrative of a DefCon convention, and I am not sure that it adds much to the book. The authors do manage to put useful information within this section, but the overall section was so dry I almost closed the book a few times. But then it picked up steam and I could not put it down until I finished it. Given my background, it was very interesting to see what I had experienced first hand (and still do as an IT consultant and auditor), knowing full well the damage those interactions alone can cause.<br /><br />The technical information presented is good, but not so deep that a nontechnical reader will get lost or bored (except perhaps for the DefCon section). As the story unfolds, the authors do a very good job showing how the emotion of a situation can lead to blaming the wrong person (in this case the programmer of the faulty software) instead of the circumstances that lead to the faults outside of his control (See my review of Secure Coding - Principles and Practices for more on this topic).<br /><br />The book is not cheap and may be a bit pricey for the content, but that does not mean it is not worth reading.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />IT Audit professionals, bureaucrats, and programmers/developers will all gain benefit from reading this book.

This is only part of a famous quote by Sun Tzu. It is often quoted and is quite appropriate when discussing Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing The Hacker Mind (Tom Parker, Eric Shaw, et al, Syngress Press, 2004, 356  Pages, ISBN 1931836116). But to truly appreciate this book, which includes an account of Kevin Mitnick's first hand description of one of his attacks, you need to think about the entire quote from The Art of War: \\"Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.\\"<br /><br />The battle against hackers is not a single battle, but an on-going series of battles against an enemy that is often unseen and unknown. What the authors of this book attempt to do is offer a glimpse in the minds of hackers, what predisposes them to their behaviours, and an understanding of how this knowledge might be used to gain an advantage over this unseen enemy. To do so requires discussions of real events, psychology and modeling.<br /><br />As such, this book is not for everyone, especially those who want an easy read. Psychological modeling is a difficult task to not only do, but to understand. The authors do their best in making this as easy as possible to understand, but I know I still had to re-read some sections multiple times. If you read this book, you will not walk away citing parts verbatim, but you will have a good desk reference to use when needed.<br /><br />What is especially valuable in this book is the coverage of threats, both internal and external. The authors not only discuss this in terms and concepts, but offer methods to model and prioritize the threats. Have you ever thought about how myopic and narrow approaches can actually put you at greater risk?<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />This is not a book for generalists. It really is for security specialists and students of security who want to get more than a superficial knowledge of the subject. Perhaps it might even be of interest to students of sociology and psychology. Tzu also said, \\"The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\\" That is the reason this book is one for the library of .serious students of the topic.

As I have mentioned in recent presentations on developing effective information technology policies, it is not realistic or recommended to adopt policies without taking a holistic view of the vulnerabilities, threats, and risk appetite of the organization.<br /><br />From this viewpoint, Flynn's third book in the series, \\"Instant Messaging Rules - A Business Guide to Managing Policies, Security, and Legal Issues for Safe IM Communication\\" (210 Pages, The American Management Association, 2004, ISBN 0814472532), offers little more than a rehash of what has been written in the first two titles. However, this does not mean the book is totally without merit and should not be read.<br /><br />The book borders on redundancy with the first two books with its discussions of threats and vulnerabilities, how to conduct risk assessments, etc. So we can skip any discussion of these topics. What the book excels in is making clear that Instant Messaging, while being a different, \\"newish\\" form of communication, is widely misunderstood in terms of the heightened levels of threats and vulnerabilities brought about because of its use. It is this misunderstanding that has many organizations not really realizing that their employees may be using public instant messaging networks at work, or that they are not treating instant messaging logs as possible business records.<br /><br />So even if you have read one or both of the earlier titles, this one is worth picking up to complete the library. I am sure she will soon have a title on blogs and content will again be redundant, but sometimes this is what it takes to get a point across.

So when I found that Goodman had written a book about the eternal struggle against spam and phishing scams, I really wanted to get my hands on a copy of Spam Wars: Our Last Best Chance to Defeat Spammers, Scammers, and Hackers (Select Books, 2004, ISBN 1-59079-063-4, 330 pages) to see his take on this subject.<br /><br />In a writing style that would make \\"Dr. Phil\\" proud, Goodman pulls no punches in providing a tough love narrative weaving history, challenges, and opportunities to attack this enemy head on and win the war. At US$12.21 a copy on Amazon, there is no reason potential readers should hesitate to buy a copy for themselves and copies for all their well meaning friends and relatives who do the stupid behaviors that spammers more than profit from.<br /><br />Goodman makes no apologies for his approach to the topic and the fact that it is driven by his personal philosophies, but unlike the author of another spam title I recently reviewed, he gets his research and facts right, not only providing citations but links to source documents. From his \\"outing\\" of the first commercial spam from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) on ARPANET in 1978, to his plain English explanations of how email is routed, to his line by line explanations of what is contained in email headers, Goodman undertakes and successfully delivers content for the lay audience, as well as technical readers.<br /><br />In some ways, Goodman may be overly optimistic that if the economic vitality that fuels spam is cut off, then the problem will go away. I myself have fought too many unsuccessful uphill battles with family and friends to either not forward mass e-mails or learn the simple BCC concept. But there is much more likelihood of success if we do this. Why? Because as Goodman illustrates very well, lobbyists and special interests have very successfully watered down any attempts at real legislation with teeth, and even the most rigid laws stop at our borders. He also shows how the original developers of the Internet are the real root cause of the problem, regardless of how good their intentions were.<br /><br />And his book also educates beyond technology and spam/scams. He teaches you about things like the fact that you do not have to return a warranty card to a manufacturer to have protections of the warranty. He talks about elements of social engineering not often discussed: the use of certain words and phrases to exploit the god-fearing, the bleeding hearts, and the lonely.<br /><br />So if you want yet another great reference book from Danny Goodman, then this book fits the bill. The only fault I have with the book and hopefully the publisher can address this is that this book was not released under a Creative Commons License like \\"We The Media\\". The reason for this is that Goodman wants the content and \\"gospel\\" passed onto as many people as possible. Creative Commons licensing would have definitely jumpstarted this effort, since there are no handy download documents or information sheets that can easily be distributed to others. However, I view this as gravy and in no way detracts from this book.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />Everybody.

When it comes to online communication using \\"covert channels\\" and \\"stegenography\\", Syngress does what is excels at: they cover the topic in the context of a fictionalized narrative to give it a \\"real world\\" context. While not as excellent as some of their other efforts in this genre, Syngress still does a good, but not perfect, job with Hacking a Terror Network: The Silent Threat of Covert Channels (364 pages , SYNGRESS, 2005, ISBN 1-928994-98-9).<br /><br />The context of this book is a revenge-motivated terrorist attack, borne out of the first Gulf War, against targets on the United States. Some might question how realistic the scenario is or is not, but the book weaves a story which may ring all too true today. The threat of terrorism is real, and it could/would be too easy for people with evil purposes to use covert channels to plan and coordinate an attack.<br /><br />Without giving away a surprising plot twist, it is hard to envision how the scenario lain out in this book could be realistic, but then again no one on the streets envisioned 9-11 or the recent bombings in London either. What Rogers does in this book is effectively explain the different types of covert channels that can be used, tools that are readily available to use the channels, and tools that are available to detect their use. He also demonstrates that how, without a stroke of luck, it may be virtually impossible to detect the use of these channels.<br /><br />The book is not written as tautly as it could be and at times you might want to say \\"Just get to the point!\\". And there are some items in the book, such as the presence of an Internet Cafe in Iraq in 1991, that require as they say in Hollywood, the \\"willful suspension of disbelief\\".

I do not often come across a book like this. Secure Coding: Principles and Practices (204 pages , O'Reilly Media, 2003, ISBN 0-596-00242-4) by Mark C. Graff and Kenneth R. van Wyk, however, meets my \\"must-read\\" criteria and then some.<br /><br />Why do I feel this way? The first reason is that the credentials of the authors far exceed those of many other authors I have read. For starters, van Wyk has his engineering degree from Lehigh University, which in some quarters used to be regarded as a far superior engineering schools than Stanford and MIT. As one of the founders of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University, van Wyk also served as the Operations Chief of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Graff, at the time he wrote the book, was the Chief Cyber Security Officer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab and often serves as an Congressional expert witness on Internet security.<br /><br />When people have credentials such as these, a reader might be afraid to pick up a book like this for fear of being intimidated by the writing of such highly qualified people. But that is the very first surprise of the book: it is written in such a plain-speak fashion with little or no unneeded fluff, that it is extremely easy to grasp their message and see how it would apply to an information technology professional's daily work routine. This is not something easily discounted, as there are many other books out there two to three more pages long that convey less than 50% of what is offered in this book.<br /><br />The authors follow a very simple and well laid out path in presenting their story. They are up front in saying that if someone claims to be an expert or that they claim they can lock down an application 100%, you should run for the hills (well not exactly in those words). But this extreme is countered with a discussion of why people write bad code, a reason that is often lost on security \\"experts\\" and auditors: people are human and respond to the various stimuli in their environment. Nobody likes to write bad code they posit, but sometimes there is not often a choice.<br /><br />As I read more of the book, I felt that these two individuals should be teaching IT audit classes and security audit classes. They are not afraid to point out that policy (and be extension business processes) should drive architecture and design decisions, not the other way around. They do not pull punches in saying that it can be dangerous to over-architect or over-design an application or system. They clearly lay out their arguments in terms that should be familiar to any IT auditor: controls, risk assessments, threats, and more. For IT developers and administrators, there are more than enough examples and discussions so that their points hit home. There are more than enough tips in the book that taught me new ways to approach my coding.<br /><br />If you are serious about wanting to do the best job possible, regardless of what you do and want value in any resources you purchase.

Does your company or organization have cyberinsurance to cover losses attributed to errors or employee misbehavior using your e-mail systems? Does your company or organization offer netiquette training for employees and managers?\\"<br /><br />In her follow-up book, E-Mail Rules - A Business Guide to Managing Policies, Security, and Legal Issues for E-Mail and Digital Communication, (254 Pages, The American Management Association, 2003), Nancy Flynn takes a narrower view of the management of E-Mail and Digital Communication in the enterprise.<br /><br />Much like her first book, Flynn lays out 37 Rules to follow in establishing and managing these policies. She starts out by establishing a framework to build a case for e-mail management. This section covers the need to reduce liability and exposure, real world legal issues, and spelling pout that e-mail belongs to the employer not the employee. From this point, she goes into specific issues surrounding privacy (very important for international communications and differences in laws), content management, Listserv use, and more. The book also has very good concise discussion about retaining e-mail as business records, different methods of storage, and employee education. Flynn then delves into discussions of E-mail Security and managing alternative technologies such as instant messaging and peer-to-peer networking technologies.<br /><br />Fir this reader, the most important rules are the last two in the book, that deal with employee training as the key to reducing risk, and working to instill a sense of ownership in employees. Without these two items, no policy ever written will work or be effective.<br /><br />Much like her first book though, the only caution for potential readers is that this book also seems to be a lead-in as a commercial for the services and her colleagues as listed in Appendix C.<br /><br />The Scorecard: Par on an average Par 4.ion for potential readers is that this book also seems to be a lead-in as a commercial for the services and her colleagues as listed in Appendix C. <br /> <br />The Scorecard: Par on an average Par 4.	2005-07-12

Lovely spam! Lovely spam!\\". For e-mail users, there are not many who would give the same response. We get it. We despise it. We wonder how many times we will get the same messages over and over again. But do we truly understand the machinations behind the scenes of the SPAM industry? It is this fundamental question that drives \\"Inside the SPAM Cartel: Trade Secrets From The Dark Side\\" (Spammer X, Jeffrey Posluns, Technical Editor, Syngress Press, 2004, 413 Pages). Written by an insider, the book provides detailed information and background but at times falters because of some very strongly stated opinions and facts that are just plain incorrect, as well as a very significant omission.<br /><br />The book starts out strongly, as the author profiles the typical Spammer he is associated with and moves on to show that their is inherent trust among spammers. This trust, it seems, is based on necessity so that they can help each other make money. Money is part of a larger theme in this book because it is money that drives spammers and the content they deliver. Did you ever wonder why you see less and less pornography spam and increased amounts of messages for home mortgages? Because that is where the money is to be made.<br /><br />The author makes a strong presentation throughout the book on how SPAM came to be from a simple but fatal flaw in SendMail, taking advantage of an Internet Architecture that was based on trust and not security, to the big money it is today. Consider that even if SPAM filters catch 99% of SPAM, the Spammers are still making money. Why? Because people are buying. The author not only gives an education on the many different types of SPAM, but shows you the tricks of the trade to bypass SPAM filters and get SPAM Messages read. You will also learn how to create a digital forensic trail to create a profile of a Spammer. You will also learn how they create profiles of you and your behaviours. You will also learn how the CAN-SPAM Act works, what is covered under the law, how to comply with the law and the huge legal loopholes that exist in the law that has Spammers scoffing at the law.<br /><br />Yes the book is comprehensive, but suffers from what this reader considers to be some fatal flaws which take some of the sheen off of the credibility of the author and of the editorial vetting process of the publisher (note that this is not referring to the technical editing, but the editing to validate content. First, it is safe to assume that \\"Spammer X\\" is a citizen of a country in the British Commonwealth. How is this known? When you read in his book that the CAN-SPAM Act was passed by \\"Parliament\\", it is clear of the author's origin and his lack of knowledge of \\"big picture\\" issues. This is further compounded by the author's statement that CAN-SPAM will eventually become international law. This statement misses the point that there is no such thing as International Law that is binding on any country that chooses to ignore it.<br /><br />The most egregious number that sticks out in this reader's mind comes from this quote in Chapter 10:<br /><br />\\"With an estimated 273,706,064 Americans on the Internet...\\".<br /><br />When this reader saw that number, some checking had to be done. Keep in mind that this book was written in 1994. According to the 2005 CIA World Factbook, last updated on June 30, 2005, the 2005 U.S. Population is estimated to be 295,734,134. That would mean the author is stating that 92.5% of Americans are on the Internet. This is very amazing when you consider that only 235,404,000 (and change) Americans are over the age of 14, and that only 260,000,000 live above the poverty line.<br /><br />The reason that this concerns this reader is that if the author has played this fast and loose with these facts, and it was not caught in the editorial process, how can any of the other numbers in the book be trusted? It pains me to say this given my distrust of IT analyst firms, but how can an author who has played so fast and loose with numbers and facts be in a position to criticize anyone else's number?<br /><br />Finally, I am disappointed that the author devotes a 29 page appendix and numerous references in the book on the anti-SPAM features of Microsoft Exchange, while totally ignoring the built in anti-SPAM features of Lotus Domino 6, which has over 100,000,000 users worldwide. Before writing this review, I asked the technical editor about this. He indicated that it was more than likely a reflection of the experience of the author(s), and that on at least two occasions he had made recommendations to include other products and service types as well. The author and Syngress did not do so, and it leaves this reader feeling a little empty.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />This book should be read by people interested in SPAM as a topic, information security managers, e-mail administrators, and educators.<br /><br />The Scorecard<br /><br />Because of the opinionated presentation, in some cases based on suspect facts and information, I am giving this book two ratings.<br /><br />For readability, technical education and content: Birdie on short Par 4<br /><br />For errors, mistakes of fact and opinions: Bogey on a Par 5 Reachable in 2 and playing downwind.

Does your company or organization have cyberinsurance to cover losses attributed to errors or employee misbehavior using your e-mail systems? Does your company or organization offer netiquette training for employees and managers? These are topics that many do not think of but should and that are covered in detail in The ePolicy Handbook: Designing and Implementing Effective E-Mail, Internet and Software Policies by Nancy Flynn (256 pages ; The American Management Association, 2001). Though this book is a few years old, it is worthwhile for Human Resource managers and anyone else involved in the development of ePolicies for their company organization.<br /><br />The book starts out by covering what every organization should do when deciding what kind of business controls to put in place: the conduct of a risk-assessment. This step is key to putting together a team, conducting a control self-assessment (the author refers to this as an audit, which really is the wrong term from a business controls perspective).<br /><br />The second part of the book covers the establishment of over all ePolicies to limit liability and exposure. One of the key considerations here is the purchase of appropriate liability insurance. As the reader moves through the book, they will be walked through the steps to craft effective policies for the use of E-Mail. the Internet, and computer software (especially piracy issues). It is after this point where most readers will get perhaps the biggest surprise and guidance. Specifically, the reader will be walked through what steps are needed to truly make any written policies effective. This includes getting buy-in from all line managers, communication of the policies, training and following through. The reader will then be walked through the establishment of eWriting policies for employees, with the main point being that writing e-mail communications should follow the same rules and style of other written communication sent through snail mail. The book finishes up discussing how to respond to an eCrisis.<br /><br />The book is a very easy read and can be a valuable resource. The only things I did not like about the book is that there are too many points repeated in the book and the fact that the book did not include a CD-ROM of samples from the book was not included. The repeated points may have been for emphasis, but to this reader often seemed to be space filler. The only other caution for potential readers is that the book, while providing good information and examples, seems to be a lead-in as a commercial for the services and her colleagues in and around Columbus, Ohio.

This change is not new in business as many people in the textile and manufacturing industries have lost their jobs to other countries, and this trend in IT is just the beginning of what is going to happen in all white collar professions in the coming years. Industry and politicians claim that displaced workers will find new careers and that this is good for the economy. But try telling that two people like my brother-in-law. He worked in textiles for 38 years and recently lost his job when his plant was shut down. With no pension and a difficult job market, what is he to do? And what happens when \\"astroturfing\\" type analyst reports are underwritten by industry?<br /><br />It is the raw emotion of the polar ends of this debate, as well as the inherent appearance of bias, that seem to have driven Ron and Anil Hira to write \\"Outsourcing America\\" (AMACOM, 2005, 236 pages), in which they attempt to cut through the emotion to look at the real issues. It is clear that they went into this project with a clear bias, which is reinforced by having Lou Dobbs of CNN write the foreword. They also make some mistakes in their discussion of government contracting. Notwithstanding, they do succeed in identifying issues and implications for society as a whole that need to be clearly studied and discussed without emotion before a final judgement should be made.<br /><br />Issues like offshoring are hard to discuss without emotion, but they are also hard to explain to the average person when couched in economic terms, so the authors do their best to make their points in a s straightforward a way as possible. However, they do tend to repeat themselves a few too many times. Where they are at their strongest is when identifying and talking about the long term impacts to communities as the result of diminished property tax revenues when high-paying jobs and the facilities that host these jobs are lost forever. Anybody who needs validation of this needs to do is look at what has happened in the Southern Tier of New York State as the result of IBM abandoning the place of its birth, taking 13,000+ jobs with them.<br /><br />The authors also do a very good job of showing that there is no free lunch in free trade, that everything that is happening is the result of negotiations that always have winners and losers. That is why negotiation is often called the art of compromise. They also do a very good job documenting how the issue is being framed by industry and offshoring allies by funding so called \\"independent\\" reports on how good offshoring is for everybody. This needs to be discussed because it is certainly not being disclosed by the reports' sponsors.<br /><br />However, their zeal to tell the story has resulted in sloppiness. In their discussions of U.S.Government Contracts, they say that the Section 8(a) program is the program that certifies businesses as small and disadvantaged. This is not correct. By definition, all 8(a) certified companies are small and disadvantaged, but not all small and disadvantaged businesses are 8(a). There is a distinction that the authors fail to distinguish or further explain. This makes this reader wonder if they were sloppy in other areas of their discussion as well.<br /><br />If there is a lesson to take away from this book, it is that corporations are indeed making short-sighted decisions for their shareholders, but not necessarily for the common good. But there may not be any choice because the genie is out of the bottle, and the authors make their recommendations on policy changes that need to be made to address the issue.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book<br /><br />This book should be read by anybody that has an opinion on offshoring, or at least thinks they do. You may choose to agree or disagree with the authors, but the content should at least make you think deeper about theissue.<br /><br />Scorecard<br /><br />Par on a Short Par 5 that should have been reached in two (their obvious viewpoint and mistake that I identified forced them to get up and down in 2 from the greenside bunker).ink deeper about the issue.  <br /> <br />Scorecard  <br /> <br />Par on a Short Par 5 that should have been reached in two (their obvious viewpoint and mistake that I identified forced them to get up and down in 2 from the greenside bunker).	2005-05-22

A good plot. Throw in the mob, strippers, assassinations, sex, money laundering, and conspiracy and what do you have? A tawdry, steamy Harold Robbins novel. Throw in computer hackers, war-driving, denial of service attacks, blackmail, social engineering, keystroke loggers, and rooms full of computer geeks? You have possibly the best book written in this post 9/11 world that deals with how teams of individuals, or even individuals who do not know they are working alone, bringing havoc to the financial markets of Africa, stealing millions of dollars in the process. No this is not a Tom Clancy book. His books, while I love them, plod along too much for the target audience of \\"Stealing The Network - How To Own A Continent\\" (FX et al, Syngress Press, 2004, 432 Pages).<br /><br />From the moment I opened the book, I did not want to put it down. Following on the heels of Stealing The Network - How to Own the Box, this book does not waste any time in capturing the readers attention and imagination, showing how vulnerable we all really are in a wired (or even wireless world), and how little we can do about it if network and security administrators do not do their jobs. It shows how things can be prevented or detected if even one bright individual is willing to step up and call attention to problems.<br /><br />I am really afraid to go into too much plot detail because it really would spoil the read, and far be it for me to tell the potential reader that \\"Rosebud is a sled\\". But all you need to know that because Kevin Mitnick was involved in the publication of this book, the scenarios and stories that are laid out and unfold may be  more real than you could imagine (or even fear).<br /><br />If you are a \\"geek\\", you will thrill at the depth and breadth of technologies covered in this book.

The reason is that next month, the third book in this series, \\"Stealing The Network - How to Own an Identity\\", is being released by Syngress. So in anticipation of this new title, I wanted to read this book, as well as \\"Stealing The Network - How To Own a Continent\\" (review to be written later this week). I did not expect to be drawn in as quickly as I was by this book, but I found myself being drawn in by the totally unique style in which technical content is presented and the fast pace the narrative took.<br /><br />Each chapter presents a mini-scenario that demonstrates how specific network vulnerabilities can be exploited, causing potential problems and losses from organizations. What sets this apart from many of these books that I have read is that is kind of set up in the style employed by the television serial \\"Law and Order: Criminal Intent\\": a focus on narrative and knowledge from the point of view of the bad guys. While this is a work of \\"techno-fiction\\", the level of detail suggests that only the names were changed to prevent the innocent (or the guilty system administrators who fail to lock systems down as well as they should or could).<br /><br />Another interesting point throughout this book is the emphasis on \\"social engineering\\", an oft overlooked weakness that has only started gaining true visibility in the evaluation and education of system administrators, managers, and end-users through highly visible incidents. It is kind of refreshing to read a detailed tale of what led a hacker to jump in a dumpster to find out information, and what led him to that point.<br /><br />It is the unique approach the authors take that may make the book a more palatable read for true \\"uber-geeks\\", rather than these people not wanting to read a dry book presenting technical material in the typical dry approach, which for sure puts me asleep any day of the week. It may also make the topic more readable for non-technical managers to get a better understanding of their risks and vulnerabilities without getting buried in technical detail. However, this also is one big weakness of the book: there is no index of keywords or topics to go back to for easy reference, which would make the book a more used reference than just a good \\"summer beach book\\".<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book<br /><br />This book should be read by students starting out their formal education in computer information systems. It can teach them lessons without beating them over the head. The book should be read by system administrators so they can see that technical information can be presented in simpler ways, encouraging them to work on their \\"soft skills\\".

In other reviews of this book, one person was upset that it did not focus on technical aspects of security assessments, but this person missed the point of that book. What this person should have read, in addition to that book, is Network Security Assessment (Chris McNab, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2004, 371 Pages). This book provides a technical deep dive into security assessments to complement Security Assessment.<br /><br />Whenever I read a new book, I hope to learn something new that I did not know before. This book did not disappoint me as very early on the author presents an overview of assessment standards. In addition to the NSA IAM covered last night, this book offers an overview of CSEG Check, which is the British Standard to evaluate and accredit security testing teams in the UK to do government work. The author also recognizes the three levels of assessment in the NSA IAM and clearly states that this book only covers the assessment and Red Team levels, as these are the nuts and bolts that take place on the project. This recognition is what makes this book the perfect complement to Security Assessment.<br /><br />This book is not for managers and sales people, it is for the people who need to do the actual assessments. The book provides detailed technical information on tools, shows how to test services, application testing and more. Now, this is not a book I run to excited to read for readings sake, but it is a reference that I can use to identify tools and tasks my teams may need to undertake or if I need to provide an independent review of a proposal for a client.<br /><br />The author also provides a number of helpful tips for when to use and not use systems in a networked environment, which may be useful for practitioners. He also provides a number of mitigation strategies depending on what is being tested.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book<br /><br />If you do not have a desire or need to get into technical nitty-gritty details, this book is not for you.

A book that, in my opinion, should never have been published. At least it should not have been put out by a technical publishing house. Or it should have had a different title or target audience. Yes, Cyber Spying: Tracking Your Family's (Sometimes) Secret Online Lives (Ted Fair, Michael Nordfely et al et al, Syngress Press, 2005, 439 Pages) is that kind of book. But what is it about this book that set me off and colored my view before I even  got past the first chapter?<br /><br />For starters, the authors start out by sensationalizing online behaviour, doing so by putting in internet chat and web site transcripts laced with sexual content and obscenities. This is totally unnecessary and they could have made their points without this. For this reader, this is hard to overlook. They make a slight recovery in the second chapter with a discussion of spying basics, making distinctions between overt and covert spying, when to use the different styles, and the impact overt spying on behaviour as the result of social engineering.<br /><br />After this, it all starts to go downhill. They spend two lengthy chapters on computer basics and networking basics, offering too much content that is superfluous at best. If this was truly a book for the masses put out by a mainstream publisher, perhaps it may have been appropriate, but not in the direction the book heads in from this point.<br /><br />I did learn a couple of new things I did not know about, like the Internet Explorer hidden \\"Super cache\\" that most people do not know to clear, but that was about it. For the average person that wants to know about how to check up on their family on-line behaviour, there is no need for the extensive discussion of Ethereal how to use it, and how to analyze the results. Most nontechnical people do not need to know how to read SMTP packet streams or how to install a secret server. This is just way over the top for the target audience of the book.<br /><br />Finally, there is no worse offense than referencing information without providing a reference, footnote or other citation. The authors are guilty of this in at least one case in this book. In fact, they do not provide citations for any of their quoted case studies or anecdotes, which puts huge strains on the credibility of the information presented.<br /><br />The Scorecard<br /><br />For those familiar with golf terminology, the authors scored a snowman on this par 4 (that means they would have shot an 8 (quadruple bogey)).

One is that too many people in online discussion fora and ListServs want templates handed to them free so they can resell them or tell their boss about the great work that they did. The second has been the absence of, in the technical book arena, any reference book that focuses more on the business process side of conducting security assessments. Security Assessment - Case Studies for Implementing The NSA IAM (Greg Miles, Russ Rogers et al, Syngress Press, 2004, 429 Pages, US$69.95 List/US$44.07 Amazon) fills both of these holes, but not without incurring a penalty stroke for \\"grounding the club\\" in a hazard.<br /><br />IAM stands for Information Security (INFOSEC) Assessment Methodology and NSA stands for the National Security Agency. These are two things you learn right up front from the authors as the explain how this methodology came to be a the result of the need to do more in a time of budget cuts and its evolution into a broad methodology that can be used by any group in the public or private sector. From this start and background, the authors successfully walk the reader through the \\"soft skill\\" side of the security assessment process. What makes this book different than others is that there is little to no discussion of tools used in the assessment. What it does focus on is how to identify assessment needs (for the customer) and opportunities (for the consulting firm). The authors approach security assessments from a holistic project approach, taking the reader through issues and steps with contract preparation/execution, skills identification, team makeup, preplanning, identification of high risk areas, conducting the assessment, delivering the end product, and closing the project out.<br /><br />For the most part, the authors excel in laying this out in simple terms and provide a number of case studies from their experience. However, as I mentioned at the beginning, I am assessing a penalty stroke in my rating because their discussion of performing security assessment work under government contracts is far too simplistic, is not wholly accurate in their discussion of contract types, and does not even address the issue of all of the additional reporting and cost accounting standards that a vendor will have to accept when doing government work. They also fail to mention how large the universe is of competitors for this work and how difficult it can be to crack this marketplace. They also fail to address legal issues associated with the scope creep in government work, with no discussion of important terms such as \\"constructive changes\\", \\"unauthorized commitments\\", \\"change orders\\", etc. They talk about \\"colors of money\\" in the government without even explaining what the term means. Granted, the book could have easily quadrupled in size to address all of this information, but they should have at least included references to sources to provide further insight into these important areas. Oh, and incidentally, the color of money under government contracts is, for the most part, transparent to contractors.<br /><br />Aside from this penalty stroke, and I am harder on it because I was a Contracting Officer in the Federal Government for a number of years, the book provides an excellent roadmap to groups and/or individuals seeking a security assessment roadmap.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />Aside from the people who post on the internet looking for solutions to be handed to them, this book would satisfy the needs of a wide variety of users. Practitioners will gain information and insight not provided in typical training classes. Customers would gain a good overview of the process and what to expect as the process goes on. Managers need to read this book so that they do not, as the authors point out often happens, try to turn this methodology into a business process. And finally, Sales staff need to readthis book so that they understand what they are trying to sell and that it is not a one size fits all commodity (kudos to the authors for putting this in writing, but it is not enough to recover the penalty stroke).<br /><br />Scorecard<br /><br />Birdie on an short par 5 playing downwind (penalty stroke can be a killer).ff need to read this book so that they understand what they are trying to sell and that it is not a one size fits all commodity (kudos to the authors for putting this in writing, but it is not enough to recover the penalty stroke).  <br /> <br />Scorecard  <br /> <br />Birdie on an short par 5 playing downwind (penalty stroke can be a killer).	2005-04-27

This site is dedicated to tricks and tips of how Google can be used to hack information in places many would consider to be \\"unlikely\\". The site is loaded with good information, so I was happy to have the chance to review Long's book entitled \\"Google Hacking for Penetration Testers\\" (2005, Syngress, 502 pages, $31.47 at Amazon). While loaded with great information and content, I must say that I left the book with mixed feelings.<br /><br />The mixed feelings mainly arise from the way the book is written. While the book is set up as a tool to help penetration testers, there are absolutely no disclaimers addressing the liabilities and risks that can arise from penetration testing, or the fact that anyone planning to do any penetration testing should have the written approval from the target company before testing begins. But then again, the tone of the book is how Google can be used to do \\"pre-testing\\" to identify holes that may be good targets for more detailed penetration testing. This is a thin line that is made thinner by the way the text is written. Specifically, it is written as if the target audience is the hacker and not the people who need to do the testing or setting up defenses. In fact, you do not hit any discussion of defensive approaches or ways to prevent these type of probes/attacks until Chapter 11 on page 321.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is not chock full of good, solid information. Long does present a thorough overview and explanation of the ways Google syntax can be used to extract many different kinds of interesting information. Whether it be finding specific file types, server type information, Microsoft Outlook mail/pst files, instant messaging buddy lists, passwords, and/or user names, Long shows how it is done. (A side note for Lotus Notes administrators: the only mention of Notes in the book is not by name, but as a screen shot of \\"even 'tight-lipped' software\\".)<br /><br />Parts of the book may get too technical for \\"non-techies\\", but you can easily skim over this information and ask your technical staff for deeper explanations of proxy servers, packet routing, and caching from your own staff who may have a better understanding of the concepts.<br /><br />Who Should Read This Book?<br /><br />So like me, if you can look beyond the elements of the book that gave me cause for concern, you will see that Long does provide a bevy of useful information for professional security auditors, information systems managers, system administrators, application developers, and information security managers. However, it would be advisable to consider the concerns I do have about what the book does not say/recommend. There is no substitute for getting written agreements from your customers (i.e. targets) or consult with your attorneys. Also make sure your professional liability insurance is sufficient to cover any potential losses that may arise from penetration testing without authorization or gone bad. All this being said, this will be a top shelf reference book in my professional library.<br /><br />Scorecard<br /><br />Long chips it in from the greenside bunker to score a birdie on a Par 4.istrators: the only mention of Notes in the book is not by name, but as a screen shot of \\"even 'tight-lipped' software\\".) <br /> <br />Parts of the book may get too technical for \\"non-techies\\", but you can easily skim over this information and ask your technical staff for deeper explanations of proxy servers, packet routing, and caching from your own staff who may have a better understanding of the concepts. <br /> <br />Who Should Read This Book? <br /> <br />So like me, if you can look beyond the elements of the book that gave me cause for concern, you will see that Long does provide a bevy of useful information for professional security auditors, information systems managers, system administrators, application developers, and information security managers.

But as I read the book on Saturday evening, I found that although there was not necessarily a direct correlation on its face, the whole underlying theme of segregation of duties/responsibility resonated with me. Why? Because like in the business environment, the break down of barriers in corporate owned newspapers is significantly eroding journalistic integrity, and according to Merritt, puts the notion of Democracy at risk.<br /><br />Right up front, Merritt admits his bias. As a former editor with Knight Ridder Newspapers, he was present at the beginning of this conglomerate. The merger between Knight, which focused on journalistic integrity, and Ridder, which focused on the bottom line, provides the backdrop for the perfect case study of what happens when two corporations with totally opposite core values and culture come together, and in this case how the bottom line becomes the driver when key mistakes are made in structuring the corporation.<br /><br />The book does not flow as easily as others I have recently read and at times Merritt unnecessarily repeats himself. but he does manage to weave a story that starts back in the 19th Century when the two companies were originally formed. He examines what was fundamentally different in the two families, one small, and one large with many sons who needed businesses. The story then evolves into one of corporate positioning and internal culture wars as the two organizations tried to meld. Much like the merger of Lotus Development Corporation and IBM, the culture wars left many casualties and bad feelings as the integration slowly moved through the years.<br /><br />It was during this time frame that Merritt went from being a journalist and editor focused on journalistic integrity to becoming a bean counter with orders to constantly cut costs. He uses a simple metric to show this decay: the number of Pulitzer Prizes won. What has happened over the past decade is that corporate owned newspapers with only one class of stock, and therefore beholden to Wall Street analysts and short term profit motives, have experienced a sharp decline in the number of Pulitzer Prizes as compared to newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post.<br /><br />Another disturbing trend Merritt notes is the decline of ethics in journalism, citing not front page stories like Jayson Blair, but other cases he has personally been involved in with his own subordinates. In the examples he gives, stronger business controls would have detected and prevented the transgressions. But this is the rub. Like academia, journalists bristle at any kind of controls as being a violation of their first amendment rights. It also leads to very public embarrassments.<br /><br />So how does this all put democracy at risk? It happens, according to Merritt, by putting the bottom line above doing responsible, in-depth journalism which  o other medium as the time of resources to do well. Blogs, he acknowledges have a place, but still are without traditional journalistic review standards for accuracy. Given limited budgets, newspapers no longer are able to cover issues of importance to the public and uncover important stories such as Watergate. The question is whether this is journalistic arrogance (and Merritt admits he has been called as such in his fight with the corporate world) or a very real truth worth reflecting on.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading an insider's view of this decay, this book may be worth a read. If you don't have the time to read it, just look at the newspapers produced by Knight-Ridder and decide if it is puff journalism or the real thing. And then ask yourselves if this is what you want from your newspapers, especially when even the worst ones make incredibly large profit margins.<br /><br />Scorecard: Par on an Average Par 4rs, especially when even the worst ones make incredibly large profit margins.  <br /> <br />Scorecard: Par on an Average Par 4	2005-03-29

When do we as information technology professionals cross the line ethically? Who us to say what is right or wrong? Are there absolutes? Or is everything just relative. These are some of the questions posed by Stephen Northcutt in IT Ethics Handbook - Right and Wrong for IT Professionals ( 648 pages ; Syngress, 2004). The only problem is that for this reader, the book left me with more questions than it answered, though I found the many examples and \\"case studies\\" included would provide good references for discussion purposes.<br /><br />The first thing that caught my attention was the author's identification of \\"moral relativism\\" as one of the dominant \\"religious thoughts\\" in the world today. The author also boldly states that in many cases \\"moral relativism\\" will \\"rapidly get you fired in the workplace\\". This latter statement may or may not be true, but itstruck me more as an ethical goal in a perfect world than as statement of fact. And there is no way in the world that this reader would consider \\"moral relativism\\" a stream of religious thought because it has no grounding in religion at all. It is a by-product of the drive for a secular society in today's world. It seems that the author does acknowledge to some degree that moral relativism is a culprit in the ethical quandaries of today, it serves as the framework for the discussion of each ethical issue raised, casting answers in a \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" point of view to show the extremes of the answers to different scenarios.<br /><br />It is here that the readers of this book would need to be very careful, as is the challenge in looking at any case study, since nothing is always cut and dry since a scenario does not always include all the factors that can drive it. The author does acknowledge this and states that every case study and answer set offered may or may not be applicable to given organizational circumstances.<br /><br />All of this being said, I would not recommend this book for anyone expecting to find cut and dry answers that they can apply to their organization. I would recommend it as a desk reference to use for ethics training session or to find information for the starting point of discussions for ethics issues that may arise at any given time in the workplace. The price is not that expensive that you would not get at least some value out of the book, even if it just challenges your thinking about what issues really fall under the realm if \\"IT Ethics\\" or how you would approach a given situation.<br /><br />The Business Controls Caddy Scorecard: Even on a Par 4ecting to find cut and dry answers that they can apply to their organization.

Most people think that auditors are lifeless, unemotional drones who move with a single minded efficiency in reviewing financial records, controls and other sundry items to ensure that the financial statements of a company are free of material misstatements and that they are accurate. In fact, Andersen auditors were often referred to as \\"Andersen Androids\\". But for most people in a corporation, that was fine because they had no real need to worry about or understand accounting and business control concepts. Put an auditing textbook in front of them and you could watch their eyes glaze over.<br /><br />Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act changes all of that, especially for line of business managers and information technology  professionals. Every day I talk to people who are faced with trying to understand SOX and implementing systems to support SOX requirements. There is often frustration in their voices or emails as they lack an effective roadmap. In How to Comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404: Assessing the Effectiveness of Internal Controls (290 pages, John Wiley and Sons, Inc, 2004. 290 Pages), Michael Ramos sets out to provide an understanding of how Section 404 of SOX came to be, what it requires, what is not required, and a roadmap for assuring compliance.<br /><br />It is not an easy task to present a comprehensive guide to aid with Section 404 compliance, but Ramos delivers in this book in ways that many others have tried and failed. Ramos is a CPA and an auditor by training and background. He starts from the explaining the responsibilities of an information systems auditor and very basic concepts of business controls, which allows every reader of the book to start with a common framework. His writing leads a reader to integrate, weave and understand what controls are and how they fit into the compliance process. He writes it in a way that does not talk down to the reader, but engages them in a thoughtful conversation as a good teacher would in a classroom.<br /><br />The book is intended to be a guidebook and a reference and its utility for this purpose will not disappoint. After laying the groundwork, Ramos leads the reader through every step of the audit processes associated with Section 404 compliance. He helps the reader understand what the auditor will be looking for and reviewing. He examines the role of automated compliance tools, including the pros and cons of their use. He helps the reader to understand the different types of controls, the different kinds of risk and what \\"materiality\\"means when reporting deficiencies. In fact, if there is one lesson to take from this book for non-auditors, materiality is not based on what YOU think is a deficiency that will impact your view and acceptability of a system, but the view of the users of a system and/or any information generated by the system.<br /><br />Who should read this book? It should be read by ALL C-level officers of an organization so they understand the concepts and the processes. It should be read by all members of an organization's audit committee so they too have an understanding. It should also be read by information systems managers so they understand that they are not operating in a silo that is independent of the rest of an organization, but that they are a fully integrated part of an ecosystem designed to support business objectives and sound corporate governance. They also need to be able to communicate with their staff about the importance of sound controls. And last but not least, it should be read by and incorporated into the toolkit of every IS Auditor.<br /><br />This is not a cheap book (US$65.00), but as the best, most comprehensive guide to Section 404 compliance out there, it is worth every penny. The implementation and evolution of tools and processes associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will bring about technical business and cultural changes in the way business is managed so that sound corporate governance is in place.

In his book, \\"Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing\\" (193 pages , O'Reilly Media, 2004, ISBN 0-596-00581-4), Andrew M. St. Laurent attempts to help readers understand the variations and complexities involved in deciding what kind of licensing model to apply to software being developed and how to understand the complexities and requirements of open source and free software licensing that someone may want to use and incorporate in software packages being developed for internal use and/or external distribution. If you are willing to slog through this short book (I say slog because it is full of legal terminology) to filter out his explanations, you may find this book useful. If you are not, you may find yourself frustrated.<br /><br />As a lawyer, Mr. St. Laurent does a very capable job in explaining the history of copyright law and then picking apart what the individual sections of licences actually mean. But he lost me early on by the very way he organizes and characterizes certain fundamental concepts, and this presentation is carried through out the book. At the outset, he talks about the fact that licenses are in fact contracts, but does not get into detailed discussions of how contracts are formed and the issues of contracts until Chapter 6. In this chapter he talks about assumptions about contracts and meanders his ways around to discussions of the required elements to have a contract, but never addresses them as such. Instead, he treats them as \\"concepts\\" as opposed to requirements. This discussion, which should have been covered in Chapter 1 as a succinct discussion of the required elements of a valid contract, easily gets lost as the readers may have struggled through all of the legal jargon and analysis that proceeded it. If he had done so, the discussion around each of the licenses could have been presented and understood in a more straightforward manner.<br /><br />That leads to my second criticism of the book. He treats each type of license (GPL, MIT, BSD, GNU General Public License, etc) individually, which made it more difficult to cross reference. As a reader interested in the best type of license to work with or how to understand a license presented, I would preferred to have each element of s standard license discussed, followed up by a comparison of how each license type addresses this issue. At the end (or even as an addendum), a chart showing the relationships, restrictions, permissions, etc of all the licenses would have been very useful.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is without merit. He does make it easy to see how people and companies/corporations can easily slip up in how they approach open source/free software. He also talks about how these different types of licensing models have evolved over time. And without saying it, he started my mind thinking about the concept of \\"legal capacity\\" and contracts. In most of the United States, a widely held legal concept is that an unemancipated minor (i.e. someone under the age of 18) does have the legal capacity to enter into a contract and these contracts cannot be legally enforced. If this continues to be held as a legal principal, how can any software license be enforced against young people who buy, sell, trade, \\"liberate\\" ( a nicer word for stealing copies), or do other things with software they have purchased? This might make for an interesting discussion down the road.<br /><br />So who should read this book? This book should be retained by business control, purchasing/acquisition and information system audit professionals as a guide when reviewing licensing issues related to internal controls and IS governance. These professionals should read and digest the material, with the help of legal counsel, and educate developers, administrators, and line of business project sponsors as to what it means and how it applies. It is not a book for developers and administrators should have themselves unless they really want to get into legal nitty gritty.<br /><br />The Business Controls Caddy Rating: Bogey on Short Par 4.<br /><br />Christopher Byrne, IBM CAAD/CASA<br /><br />The Cayuga Group, LLC<br /><br />\\"The Business Controls Caddy\\"<br /><br />[...]get into legal nitty gritty.  <br /> <br />The Business Controls Caddy Rating: Bogey on Short Par 4.  <br /> <br />Christopher Byrne, IBM CAAD/CASA <br />The Cayuga Group, LLC <br />\\"The Business Controls Caddy\\" <br />[...]	2004-09-12

Before I started reading \\"We The Media:Grassroots Journalism By The People, For The People\\",(299 pages , O'Reilly Media, 2002, ISBN 0-596-00733-7) written by Dan Gillmor, I had my mind all set up that it would be some more rubbish spit out by a hack journalist. This was easy for me to do because I never considered myself to be a journalist and I knew virtually nothing about Dan Gillmor. The latter is because I have probably had my head buried too deep into purely technical books more than I should. I also have been undecided on the role of \\"new media\\" in society as a whole because of my disdain for the latest and greatest toys pushed out by manufacturers. Then I sat down and read this book. I was instantly drawn in, not only because I had started my own blog in July, but because the book challenged me to think about the role of bloggers in society. I do not agree with everything Mr. Gillmor has written, but like movies like \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", a truly good book is one that challenges your notions, makes you think about them, and offers you the chance to enter into conversation about them.<br /><br />If you choose to read this book, don't expect a how to guide on how to build and publicize a blog. Expect to gain an understanding how, in Mr. Gillmor's view, the blog boom is a natural extension of how journalism has changed over the years. I disagree with him that we as bloggers are journalists because I define it differently. In fact, I believe that between the lines of this book, a reader will see that they are not truly journalists in the strictest sense, BUT, because blogs are essentially journals that we write and publish, what we write can take on a life of its own. Even though we do not have copy editors reviewing our work, blog postings can and do take on a life of their own, sometimes with damaging results. For me, this is key in Mr. Gillmor's presentation.<br /><br />Mr. Gillmor discusses the evolution of Mickey Mouse (tm) impact of copyright law in the United States. If you can read this section of the book and not come away with even a smidgen of disgust for the tactics and hypocrisy of the corporate world in preventing works from truly entering the public domain as originally envisioned, then you will need to go back and reread the book. Here is where I diverge from his point of view again. Mt. Gillmor talks extensively of his view of Free Speech as being an inherent right on the Internet in all forms, with courts and laws stifling free speech with every chance they get. This IS something I did expect from a book written by a journalist. For me, we have no right to impose our values on other sovereign nations and that in our own nation, irresponsible free speech on the Internet needs to be policed. Yes I know this is a slippery slope, but his book provides a catalyst for conversation.<br /><br />For business large and small, this book needs to be read to understand that a blog is not a toy of the fringe. It is a tool that is increasingly used to keep journalists and corporations/companies in line and the bull meter low (...). This same audience needs to read this book to understand how not using this medium themselves is a mistake, giving examples of how companies use and regulate it. There are business control and corporate governance issues that need to be addressed with this new medium. Without a fundamental understanding of the medium, the risks associated with it cannot begin to be assessed.<br /><br />For students of journalism and new media, this book should be required reading. Mr. Gillmor points out that the field of journalism is often slow to react to change. They no longer can be and this understanding needs to start in the journalism schools and new media institutes (I will make sure that Dr. Scott Shamp at the University of Georgia's New Media Institute (...).<br /><br />For bloggers of all kinds, whether they consider themselves to be journalists or not, need to read this book. They need to read and understand its context. They need to understand what their impact is. I also feel that they need to recognize their societal obligations in their writings (...), which I do wish Mr. Gillmor had addressed more in the book.<br /><br />Over 20 years ago, I sat in a senior Political Science seminar at Niagara University (...) called \\"Women and Politics\\" taught by  Dr. Nancy McGlen (...). In her book, \\"Women's rights: The struggle for equality in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\\", she wrote about the presence of a critical mobilizing event being required for a social movement to truly take hold. Mr. Gillmor begins his book about the new media with virtually the same thesis. Whether the event he cites is the event is correct or not, its fits her model, I feel this book is the medium for serious discussions of the role of new media in society and in itself should be considered a critical mobilizing event.<br /><br />I am not writing this to sell you a book. You see, Mr. Gillmor totally won me over when I got to the punchline of the book: It would be nice if you bought it, but you do not have to. It is available free for download from the \\"We The Media\\" blog (...) and under Creative Commons licensing, you are allowed to make derivative works. And true to his beliefs, Mr. Gillmor and the publisher have agreed that the copyright on the book, in the spirit of the original copyright laws, will expire after 14 years.<br /><br />I have already finished 95% of a derivative work: a searchable Lotus Notes database version of the book that I plan to give to a colleague at the Atlanta Journal Constitution and any other Lotus Notes users that want to read it in this format.

Ever since the birth of the World Wide Web, we have been inundated with books purporting to have all things \\"Internet\\", buying into the hype surrounding the explosion of the web. What these books failed to do was educate people about the lack security and privacy inherent on the Internet, That is why I was wanted to read \\"Web Security, Privacy and Commerce: 2nd Edition\\" (734 pages (I do not count an index in the page count), O'Reilly Media, 2002, ISBN 0-596-00045-6). Written by Simon Garfinkel, with Gene Spafford, I read more and more with pleasure and anticipation. This was confirmed with a simple line that has often been lost on the masses: the Internet was built for communication and sharing, not for business and the protection of data at each end of the connection. Unfortunately, the explosive growth of the Web did not allow for this issue to be fully addressed or for reliable tools to be built quickly enough.<br /><br />Now other reviews I have read on here blast the book for being too generic and not what they expected from O'Reilly. But that is what I find to be a breath of fresh air: a wide-ranging important topic that does not get bogged-down in techno-speak, something which might normally turn readers away from technical books.<br /><br />From the outset, Garfinkel and Spafford tell you that their goal is to cover the fundamentals of web security and not to be a primer for \\"computer security, operating systems, or the World Wide Web\\". Do they succeed in their goal? Absolutely! Starting with web technology, they address security, web architecture, cryptography (what it is and what it isn't), SSL and digital identification. They then move onto privacy and security for users in very simple, direct, tell it like it is style. How many people know what \\"Joes\\" are and the fact that anyone could look at their users and find at least one? How often have you read that using a 16 character password is counterproductive and that if chosen correctly, an 8 character password should be more than adequate? When is the last time you had an author break down cookies line by line for you to truly understand them? Have you ever tried to find out what the code inside a worm is and does?<br /><br />As they weave their story, they then cover Web Server Security and offer a very compelling argument for using a Mac with OS 7, 8 or 9 for a server (I won't give away the reason why here or tell you that Rosebud is a sled). For the programmer, this section offers a street-smart view of coding vulnerabilities and ways to minimize them. In addition, they cover physical security, as well as host security, for servers. Want to really understand SSL and certificates and want to know why Netscape 4 was a bad example of certificate planning? I had never thought about it until reading their discussion of the topic.<br /><br />They finish up with coverage of security for content providers. What is very, very good here is that they cover privacy policies, filtering, censorship and intellectual property. They help you truly understand what fair use is and what it really means.<br /><br />The only negative I had was too short a discussion on Social Engineering. However, given the fact that this was published in 2002 and phishing scams had not really taken off raising awareness of the issue, I am giving them a mulligan for this.<br /><br />The ideal audience for this book is people who need to have a broad understanding without nitty-gritty detail that they will get lost in.  How good a reference do I find this book to be? Well for starters, I wished I had it at my side when preparing for the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) Exam offered by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). It puts their review materials to shame (have to be honest about that). This book will be part of my permanent library and will be required reading for any information systems auditors doing work for my company. I will also be using this book as asource text for training provided to companies, developers, and administrators.<br /><br />The Business Control Caddy Scorecard: Double-Eagle on a Par 5.<br /><br />Christopher Byrne, IBM CAAD/CASA<br /><br />The Business Controls Caddy (tm)<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]g this book as a source text for training provided to companies, developers, and administrators.  <br /> <br />The Business Control Caddy Scorecard: Double-Eagle on a Par 5.  <br /> <br />Christopher Byrne, IBM CAAD/CASA <br />The Business Controls Caddy (tm) <br />[...] <br />[...]	2004-08-19

But how does one really get a handle on the threats in an ever changing environment? How do you get inside a hacker's head? In their book Security Warrior (506 pages, O'Reilly Media, 2004, ISBN 0-596-00545-8), Cyrus Piekari and Anton Chuvakin attempt to take the reader inside the mind of the hacker, to find out what they already know about our systems, tools they use to analyze and attack our systems, and how they then cover their tracks.<br /><br />This book will satisfy people from system administrators to CIOs from different levels. For the hard core 'techno-geek', the first part of the book goes into extensive discussion of reverse engineering, including many, many pages of code showing how it is done. Of course, this is done with a legal disclaimer that basically says \\"do not do this at home, but if you do it is at your own risk\\".  As this book was released just this year, there are great overviews of how attacks are launched on Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Windows CE. If your focus is on wireless, they have you covered. SOAP, XML, & Web services Security? Not a large amount of material, but enough to get you started.<br /><br />The only major fault I find with this book is that social engineering only gets 11 pages of coverage, even though Piekari and Chuvakin state up front that social engineering is one of the most threatening forms of hacking attacks. Granted, it is a very complex issue that could (and often does) fill a volume by itself. While people outside of the system administration arena may glisten key points from this book, it really is a tool that should sit on the bookshelf of every system administrator. It provides a very broad overview, while providing extra references for each chapter if you want to dig into more detail. You will learn things from the darkside you may not have known about, but in the end this is a good thing. And if you want to skip over the lines of detailed code, you can do this safely as long as you know reverse engineering is a problem and that you have a detailed reference to go back to.<br /><br />The Business Control Caddy Scorecard: Birdie on a long par 5.<br /><br />Christopher Byrne<br /><br />The Business Controls Caddy<br /><br />[...]he darkside you may not have known about, but in the end this is a good thing.
