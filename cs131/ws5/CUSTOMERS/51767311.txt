Ms. Enoch is one of those doing better.  Rick and Sam are complex characters that catch your interest and hold it.  The plot works, the characters work, we have humor, we have sex, we have conflict and the story pulls you in and won't let go.  It's one of those books you don't want to end.  Fortunately, it won't since Ms. Enoch tells us at the end of this book that another Rick and Sam story is on the way.  Can't wait!  For a GREAT cat burglar/historical romance, read Connie Brockway's ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT.	2005-04-09

I've read and enjoyed all her books but this one just didn't do it for me.  I'm not sure why.  The characters were okay; the plot was okay; the action was okay.  Wait a minute!  I think I see a pattern here.  Nothing was great, just okay.  I got the impression Ms. Albert's publisher was waiting on her latest so she just dashed this one off.

The writing is so sophomoric that, other than the sex scenes, it could have been written for teenagers (or by a teenager).  Do yourself a favor and order MR. IMPOSSIBLE by LORETTA CHASE.

I know I'm in the minority but, Ms. Thornton's republication of this 1990 book was not a good idea as far as I'm concerned.  Scarlet Angel was also written in 1990 and is a much better book.  Anything she has written in the last seven or so years is a much better book.  Had someone handed me this with the cover torn off, I would not have recognized it as an Elizabeth Thornton book.  First you have the \\"hero\\" who is physical with our heroine and feels he has to protect (translation: control) her for her own good. . .wow.  This one is dated.  This one will not join my other Thornton books on my keeper shelf.  Try any of her other books or try Leslie LaFoy's trilogy.  Much better investment.	2005-03-31

I was so happy to find her second book about the Carsington family.  Thank goodness it's a large family!  To make it even better, Ms. Chase actually has the story take place in Egypt.  So many authors start a book in Egypt but by the second chapter ther're back in England.  Why?  You would think they would know their characters could get into more exciting and dangerous adventures in Egypt.  Maybe that's what separates Ms. Chase from the writing herd.  She's smart and knows her subject.  This is a funny, sexy, can't put it down book.  I'm not going to go into the plot since that's been done in other reviews, but if you like smart characters and adventure, this one's for you.  If you need something to read until Ms. Chase writes her next book, try Leslie LaFoy's trilogy.  Excellent, too.	2005-03-31

I thought this was a particularly appropriate plot device since in the other \\"slightly\\" books he was always in control and two steps ahead of everyone.

I never want them to end because they are so good and I have to wait a year for another one.

Wrong.  First of all if you've read any of my reviews you know I hate it when an author falls back on the psycho-torture-women-killer menace.  Why not just stick with the mafia as the threat to our heroine?  It's almost as if Robards started out with the mafia as the main threat and then couldn't make the story come together.  It was very difficult to get into the characters and plot.  This is probably the first Robards' book I had to force myself to finish.  Let's hope she rushed through writing this book in order to fulfill a publishing obligation so that she could spend more time on her next (hopefully better) book.  This was a toss up between 2 stars and 3 stars.  Because I like this author, I went with the 3.  Everyone is entitled to an off day every once in awhile.	2004-02-10

I know this story has been done before but Mary Balogh makes all other revenge driven plots pale in comparison.  This is her best Bedwyn so far.  An intelligent heroine (as the Bedwyn women are) is always a welcome addition to any book.  Morgan turns out to be so much more than Gervase expects and in turn Gervase turns out to be much more complex than Morgan realizes. Both protagonists are intelligent and witty.  You'll be drawn into the story almost immediately and I would bet you won't put this book down until you've finished it.  But don't hurry.

A stong female lead and a sexy male lead with in-depth character development and great plot keep this story moving.  It heats up with not only sexy love scenes but, before they even get together physically, hot under the collar flirting. You also get two romances for the price of one with Lanie's mother's story.

This book has it in spades - not to mention loads of humor and witty dialogue.  A rascal of a hero and a spunky heroine collide in a comical first meeting and the story takes off from there.  She's rich and he's poor and desperate for an heiress.  But fear not, this is not your typical regency romance.  It's much, much better.  Get ready to read this one straight through.  You won't want to put it down.  A definite keeper.	2002-05-11

So much humor and heart have gone into this book and the language and descriptions are so truly southern.  You hate for the story to end.  The characters are absolutely priceless.  The story starts when the two main characters are children and follows them into adulthood.  The little girl is rich and the older boy she befriends is poor and abused.  The first part of the book is probably the best (the childhood years) but all of it is simply amazing.  The author grabs hold and doesn't let you go until the final page.  Keep the hankies handy, open that box of bon bons and ENJOY!  Highly recommended and a definite keeper.	2002-05-11

Needless to say I ordered TO BURN immediately.  First of all let me clear up a misunderstanding on the part of one of the other reviewers.  Wulfred did not kill Melania's father.  She specifically asks that question and his answer is a definite NO.  That said, I was disappointed in the book.  Was it the time period?  Was it the plot?  I'm not sure.  If you are a Dain fan, I would probably pick this one up used.  Is it a keeper?  Again, if you are a Dain fan you will probably put it on the shelf with her other books, but I would almost bet you don't read it again.  If you haven't read CD's earlier books, start with them.  You won't be disappointed.	2002-05-11

Either that or it was written by someone else.  Once again, in my opinion, Ms. Bevarly has failed to write a good contemporary romance.  With so many really great and humorous authors out there, why waste your time on this book?  As in HE COULD BE THE ONE, EB's use of &quot;um. . .&quot;, &quot;hmmm. . .&quot;, &quot;ah. . .&quot;, &quot;and. . .and. . .and&quot;, &quot;of. . .of. . .of&quot;, etc. is just so irritating I wanted to scream.  Is this supposed to be cute or endearing?  If so, if fails miserably.  I did actually manage to finish this book (unlike HE COULD BE THE ONE) but the only way I accomplished that was by skipping over the insipid language - which was half of the book.  I give up.

Ms. Heyer is the MASTER of regency/historical romances and, of course, most of the present day writers would agree with me.  This is one of her best.  The plot, the language, the characterizations are simply superb.  Ms. Heyer paints a vivid and true to life portrait of the times.  You will be hooked from the first page.  All this and she does it without graphic sex (not that I have anything against that!).  I have almost all of her books and will treasure them until I'm too old to read or comprehend.  Two others that are a must are BLACK SHEEP and THE MASQUERADERS.  What am I saying!  99.9% of her regency romances are a must.  This lady was an unbelievable talent!  A no-doubt-about-it KEEPER.

For some reason it took me awhile to get into this book (I don't know why), but once I was there I couldn't put it down.  Good plot and good characterization with interesting secondary characters.

This one even has a kid and a dog, but they definitely don't steal the story - although they do add a lot to it.  Don't miss this one.

However, I had forgotten that I also bought SNOWFALL so I decided to grin and bear it.  WELL. . .can't believe it was written by the same author.  Where REMEMBER ME was amateurish - writing, plot, characters - I found SNOWFALL to be an intelligent read.  Romance, danger, murder, a smart but not perfect heroine and a strong hunky hero.

With some authors I just NEED to have every book they've written and Anne Stuart is one of them.  If you've read any of her books (historical or modern) you know she goes in for a dark hero who is usually more bad than good (or maybe I should say so bad he's good).  At any rate, I stumbled across this earlier book and WOW!!!  What a ride.  It takes place right after the French Revolution and our French heroine has managed to survive but not without a load of emotional scars.  She is living in England when low and behold she is presented with the opportunity to take revenge on the Englishman (our hero) she blames for all the woes she and her family suffered during the reign of terror.  And we're off. . .  Needless to say things don't go as she plans.  Great story line, great characters who are FULLY developed and complex.  Wonderful \\"secondary character\\" love story.  Order this book!  It is worth the extra you will have to pay for a used copy.  A definite keeper to add to your Anne Stuart collection.  It's 394 sexy pages of adventure, tears and pleasure!	2002-03-03

First of all let me say I HATE books where the bad guy is a psycho-female-killing-torturing goon. (I'm not giving away the plot by mentioning the psycho since he is in the story from the start.)  To my way of thinking, it is a plot cop-out.  I KNOW authors can come up with a better way to get the heroine in danger (and thus allow our hero to rescue her).  BUT. . .that said, I really liked this book.  I more or less skimed over the psycho part and concentrated on the rest of the story. Yes, you need one to make the other, but you don't have to dwell on his actions until the end of the book.  This book might not singe your eyelashes, but it is pretty hot stuff and Joe and Alex are hot together.  I'd put this one on the keeper shelf.	2002-02-28

I read SO WILD A HEART (and another book whose name I can't remember) and fell in love with Candace Camp's style.  Naturally I rushed to Amazon.com and ordered another book by Ms. Camp.  That book was SCANDALOUS.  The description was too much to resist but the actual story was a little bit of a let down.  It is a somewhat light weight story compared to the other two books I've read by Ms. Camp.  Not as much tension, sexual or mystery wise, the characters were too perfect (I like a little character flaw in my hero), and the story in general just didn't grab hold and make you want to stay up all night reading.

Great love story that starts out slow and builds.  Only one aspect of the plot was a little out there, but by the time you get to that particular plot line, you won't care.

You have your typical alpha male MS style and a heroine who is strong enough to stand up to him.  Good mystery.

However, Ms. Jensen delivers in all three of her &quot;men of the secret service&quot; books.  If you haven't read the first two books in this set, start with ENTWINED, then FALLEN and finally MOONLIT.  Great reading.  You will come to care for each and every character in her stories.

You have our hero - who granted is a little different from her former heroes - but not nearly as bad as Judith's review indicates.  Of course we have to have him resisting his attraction to our heroine (and she got in her verbal licks, too!), that's what makes the sexual tension heat up.  This is a smart, sexy story.  A good mystery which is not in your face obvious, and best of all - no psycho/rapist/serial killer!!!  Let's face it!  There are a lot of books out there with that plot and authors who keep reusing it.  At least SA varies her plots and the characteristics and personalities of her main characters.  If you want the same old thing time after time, read Jayne Ann Krentz (no, that's not a compliment).  For another GREAT, SEXY read - try LONE RIDER by LAUREN BACH.

I haven't decided if it will go on my keeper shelf.  If you're like me, you just have to read/collect certain authors' books (Linda Howard, Anne Stuart, Cherry Adair, etc) so if you are a SA fan, you will probably buy it regardless.  Take note that this was first published in 1993.  Don't look for her trademark humor (as with her later books).  The hero in this particular book is a little hard to take at times.  He's divorced and his obsession with his former wife's cheating gets to be a little much.  However, it is still a pretty good thriller and the heroine is top notch.

Maybe I just like a little more seduction and a slightly slower pace as far as the romance is concerned.  In fact, I guess that's the problem.  I wouldn't call what happened between them a romance.

I didn't buy another IJ book until just recently.  It was pretty good so I ordered The Ugly Duckling.  This book just blew me away.  Great adventure, love story, survival, revenge - WOW!  The back of this book says, &quot;A real knockout. . .[an] intense thriller. . .bravo!&quot;  I couldn't agree more. The female lead goes from a timid woman to a strong in-control heroine.  She and our anti-hero have great chemistry.  Buy it!  You won't regret it for a minute.  A real keeper.	2001-11-03

Since it is LH, I can't give her anything less than a four because I LOVE her books.  It's not as bad as some of the reviews lead you to believe - and it's not as good as a lot of her other books.  My only problem with the book was the hero.  His initial description/introduction didn't exactly grab me.  Usually LH's heros are to die for from the beginning until the end.  However, he grew on me and the story had a lot of humor and action.  A big plus - no psycho killer.  Let's face it.  Just about every book you pick up has a psycho killer in it.  No it's not as good as Mr. Perfect, but it's worth your time.  Once agin LH . . .a western, PLEASE.	2001-10-17

More action, more steam - and not just from the jungle location!  A little too close to home with our present terrorism problems but if we had a hand full of Kyles at our disposal, our country could rest easy.  My one complaint is the cover.  Where did they come up with that male model.  It looks like he's been waxed and hasn't seen the sun EVER.  Come on!

Her books grab you at the prologue and don't let go until the end. It's not too many authors who know how to immediately capture your attention in the first few pages. Her heroines are always strong, or quickly learn how to be strong, and refuse to be victims. In this story an innocent woman is catapulted into a deadly game of espionage through a chance encounter with a desperate spy. The hero is a friend who wants to be more than a friend. Great reading. Wonderful romance. Fast paced and sure to hold your attention until the end. Don't forget to request the epilogue to this story from ET's web site.	2001-08-25

Mr. Perfect is no exception.  At the time of this review I think there were 176 reviews written.  I'm wondering what I could say that someone else hasn't already said.  More humor in this book than her previous works.  Think Janet Evanovich.  In fact, Ms. Howard's latest heroine reminds me a lot of JE's Stephanie Plum.  High praise!!  LH's hero is not quite as in your face macho as her previous heros but he is macho enough and a guy to die for (make that live for).  LH, if you read this (Yeah, like that's gonna happen!), PLEASE write another western.  Mr. Perfect - a keeper that I've added to my LH collection.

Instead we only visit Egypt in tantalizing flashbacks.  The adventures detailed in the flashbacks would surely have been more interesting than the story we're given.  And one more gripe - on the front cover of the book Christina Dodd is quoted as saying, &quot;A luscious, sexy, Scottish romp.&quot; - which proves to me that she didn't read the book.  Yes, the present day action takes place in Scotland but in no way would I describe it as a &quot;Scottish romp.&quot;  Not a keeper.  Buy it used if you just have to have it.	2001-06-10

This was a pretty good story, but too much conflict between the hero and heroine.  Let's face it.  Most of the romances written revolve around the same basic plot - hero meets heroine, they fall in love but don't let each other know, misunderstandings arise and cause them to separate (either physically or emotionally), they get back together, and live happily ever after.  However, our hero seems to misunderstand and push our heroine away too much in this one.  The plot was interesting and the mystery light.  Afraid you'll have to decide for yourself whether you like this one or not.  It's certainly a mixed bag.	2001-05-24

I'm not saying throw it back, just don't pay full price for this book.  The story would have worked much better had EB limited her use of \\"uh\\", \\"eh\\", \\"um\\", \\"mmm\\", \\"hmm\\", and \\"gee.\\"  A little of this and the reader thinks it's cute, but too much will drive you crazy.  To make matters worse, the hero is primarily the guilty party.  Instead of making him endearing, he comes across as being inept.  Let's hope this isn't a trend which EB plans to adopt for future books.  If you haven't read \\"How To Trap A Tycoon\\". . .do so.  It's EB at her best.	2001-05-24

I've read most of Ms. Brockmann's books (Heartthrob, Bodyguard, etc.) and have to admit I've enjoyed them all.  This one is a little wordy in the beginning while she introduces you to characters who appeared in The Unsung Hero (****), but then it takes off.  I would read The Unsung Hero first so that you are familiar with the great characters Ms. Brockmann has created for her SEAL series.  This book is unique in that we have two and one-half love stories going at the same time.  It works!!  The one-half is to be continued in her next book which I will definitely order.  The Defiant Hero is sure to entertain you.  Plus, it's the older woman/younger man scenario.  Being an older woman, I LOVE IT!  I've just started &quot;Going Overboard&quot; by Christine Skye, which also involves a hunky SEAL (although I think this story is going to be lighter than Brockmann's), so if you have a thing for the strong macho type, you might want to check it out.	2001-05-11

This was my first Julia Quinn book, and I have to say I was enchanted.  FUNNY!  I'm talking laugh-out-loud funny.  A love story with seduction (love the seduction), humor and, of course, a happy ending.  Contrary to DISAPPOINTED! in Martinsburg, PA USA, I do not think Ms. Quinn is resorting to Amanda Quick's formula style (agree TOTALLY with you as far as AQ goes).  I read &quot;The Duke and I&quot; right after Viscount and, yes, there are certain similarities, but let's face it. . .in regency love stories (or any love story) you have hero, heroine, conflict, happy ending.  However, Ms. Quinn's route to that happy ending is delightful.  Thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think it deserves a five star rating (&quot;The Duke and I&quot; gets a four).  It's a keeper.	2001-05-10

I disagree with one review calling this a classic &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; scenario.  First, Nathan is not a beast (in personality or looks) and second, Isobel is not a classic beauty.  Instead this is a classic (and original) love story, a good mystery (with a surprise at the end), and a story that is not compromised by the ending.  This is great story telling!  I would also recommend Liz Carlyle as an author to check out if you enjoyed this book.	2001-05-10

Well, you might be a little embarrassed by the title but, trust me, you'll love it.  Funny, sexy and smart.  The characters are intelligent, and thank goodness the hero doesn't desert the heroine in her time of need.  Let's face it, most authors feel the need for too much conflict.  This is the perfect blend for a great romance.  A fun read for your vacation (or anytime).  After having read &quot;Her Man Friday&quot; (3 stars), I wasn't very enthusiastic about reading another book by this author.  However, ... kept recommending it so I finally caved.  Good move on my part!  Will definitely check out her books in the future.	2001-05-06

Really enjoyed My False Heart which led me to Beauty Like the Night (before A Woman of Virtue, Beauty was my favorite LC book), then to A Woman Scorned - which you need to read in order to fully enjoy A Woman of Virtue (the best!).  In the review from Falls Church, VA, the reader was unhappy because, as that reader put it, Jonet was a &quot;shrew&quot;.  I would be a little more generous or understanding.  The woman was stressed out to the max after all.  She was running on little sleep and worried to death about her children.  Of course she would be short tempered.  But more than that, who wants all the female leads in all the books you read to be the same?  Not I.  That's one thing I like about LC's books.  The female lead characters are all different.  Of course, Cole is to die for even though I question some of the scenes and dialogue (the &quot;F&quot; word in particular) as coming from an ordained minister.  I explained it away with the thought that, after all, he was also a soldier and a man.  I also think that particular language was fairly prevalent in that era.  Yes?  No?  Don't let the negative reviews keep you from this book and others by LC.	2001-04-14

Before this book, Beauty Like the Night was my favorite, but this one delivers more.  Humor (thank you LC), mystery, a strong female lead (but not too strong), a hero to salivate over (of course), a great love story with a little seduction on the side (again, thank you LC - I love the seduction) and hot love scenes.  But more than that, LC makes her secondary characters so interesting you want to know more about them.  Kemble is a hoot!  Where did he come from and how did he pick up so many talents?  Max de Rohan (and his dog) is so interesting, you wonder where he goes and what he does after each leave taking.  It's easy to spin a story around two characters and draw you into their lives, but when an author fully and lovingly developes minor characters too. . .well, you're in for a treat.  Still waiting for Bentsen's (from Beauty Like the Night) story, LC!	2001-04-14

It is simply the best.  It is seldom you come across a good western romance that grabs you from the start and pulls you along for the ride.  Great characters.

What sounded like an exciting book - exotic location, original plot, romance, adventure - quickly disappoints.  I'm not sure I can explain why.  One of the reasons books seldom translate well into movies is because the movie cannot show what the character's are thinking.  In the case of this book, however, I would have relished less lengthy &quot;conversations&quot; in their heads and more interaction between the characters.  Also, Jezebel's constant flight from Rafe gets old real fast.

I remember her earlier books and they were great.  However, someone needs to clue Ms. Krentz in to the difference between FORMULA and GENRE.  She is definitely stuck in FORMULA MODE.  Whereas her earlier books were varied in location and plot, now it seems all her books take place in the Washington state area, there is a mildly threatening villain, and her hero and heroine have to eat pesto and/or buckwheat noodles before the end of the story.  I can envision her sitting at her computer plugging in different names for the characters and changing the plot just enough to satisfy her editors.  My question is, why read her books?  If you've read one you've read them all.  I kept buying them because of the memory of her earlier books.  Okay.  I get it now.  No more!  Jayne, Jayne, Jayne!!  I know you can do better.  Meanwhile I'll get my thrills from Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Meryl Sawyer, Suzanne Brockman, Rachael Gibson or Susan Andersen.	2001-02-17

The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because I like my romances a little hotter.  I would not be the least bit embarrassed to recommend this book to my mother.  In fact, I'm sending her my copy today.  As to whether I will read any more of Ms. Heath's books. . .maybe.	2001-02-17

After It Had To Be You and Heaven Texas, I was a little hesitant to jump back into another SEP book.  I felt uncomfortable with the &quot;heroes&quot; in those books.  Was never sure I even liked them.  Low and behold along comes Dream A Little Dream, and I am hooked from the start.  A fully developed character in SEP's fiesty heroine who you pull for, feel for, cry for and laugh with (excuse the prepositions).  A hero that, while initially unpleasant, you can at least understand why he shut down his emotions.  Great, great story.  Good secondary characters, too.  This book should get at least 5 stars and definitely more than the above mentioned SEP books.  Dream A Little Dream is a book to keep and reread.  Light the fire in the fireplace, grab a glass of wine, and enjoy.	2001-01-30

I just happened to read a blurb on this book given in the back of another book I was reading.  It was enough to make me curious.  Fortunately it turned out to be a nice surprise.  Lots of action, an anti-hero, a heroine who transforms nicely as the book progresses and just enough romance.  A great read.	2001-01-25

Hard to believe after her truly wonderful &quot;Silk&quot; trilogy.  If you're looking for more of the same, pass on this one.  A major yawn.	2001-01-21

The heroine is not only beautiful but smart, strong and gives as good as she gets.  Funny, seductive, sexy banter between Jess and Dain grab you  immediately.  Think of a sexy Hepburn/Tracy combination.  WOW!   And thank  you Loretta Chase for not following the usual formula!	2000-07-05
