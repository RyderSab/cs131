In order to better understand his newly adopted home, he used the city's subway system as a means to explore the city.  Trained as a sociologist, he took photos of what he saw.  \\"Subway Memories\\" is a collection of his best photos taken from 1970-2004. <br /> <br />Individually, there is very little special about his photographs.  They look like snap shots of ordinary people and scenes.  What gives these photos value is that they are brought together as a collection.  Over the years, Vergara went back to the same spots and took photos from the same vantages.  Through this collection, the reader can see how sections of New York grew old, died, decayed and then were reborn. <br /> <br />On a personal note, I can remember travelling New York's subways in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  These were the nadir years of New York's public transit system.  I loved seeing photos from that time period.  I still find it unbelievable to see how bad conditions were during these times.  Some of Vergara's photos are a blast from a nightmarish past.	2005-10-08

Fortunately, there were still plenty of examples of America's rural past scattered along the backroads and other forgotten areas of the nation's countryside.  Sloane spent many years, seeking out these historic relics so that he could study and sketch them.  The result is whole series of books that chronicle America's historic material culture.  This book focuses on barns. <br /> <br />What makes an Eric Sloane book so unforgetable are the black and white sketches.  If you are a visual learner who believes a good drawing is worth a thousand words, Eric Sloane is the author for you. By no means is this an academic study of the different barn styles that existed in the United States.  Instead this book is a collection of beautiful drawings that can help the reader understand how barns were built and what they were used for.  This is a magical book.  If you like it, you will have many hours of pleasure seeking out and reading Eric Sloane's other books.  Highly recommended. A great value. <br />	2005-10-08

Unlike many writers of his time, he understood the danger of first facism and then later communism.  He best books were written before the Second World War \\"A Coffin for Dimitrios\\" and just right after \\"Judgment on Deltchev\\".  His books about the end of Colonialism in Southeast Asia, \\"State of Seige\\" and \\"Passage of Arms\\" are also gems written while these events were happening.      Eric Ambler created the modern espionage novel and this is the genre where he shines.  His crime novels like \\"The Light of the Day\\" are very good but in my view are second tier works.  I can see why many reviewers gave this novel five stars.  Ambler's writing style is so strong and Athens and Instanbul are exotic locations. While Ambler's lead character is very interesting, I found the plot to be too formulaic.  He systematically goes from point A to point B and then to point C.  There are none of the great plot twists which the best Ambler novels are known.  Although a superior stylist, Ambler plods his way through this novel.    Vintage Crime/Black Lizard seems to be re-releasing all of Eric Ambler's novels. If you are new to Eric Ambler, he is defintely worth reading. He is a master of the espionage genre.  However, start with another one of his more political novels.  \\"The Light of Day\\" should be read after all the really great novels have been consumed.	2005-10-03

He wanted to document through his wonderful illustrations and writings, a material culture that would soon be gone.  <br /> <br />Sloane's take on American history ignores the big names and the famous dates. He is more interested on the mundane and ordinary.  Sloane's point of view is that most Americans were farmers a hundred years ago and therefore had to master a whole series of skills that are now gone.  Purchase this book, if you want to see how are ancestors lived and functioned on a daily basis.  Sloane's wonderful illustrations are like a window into a time that is long gone. <br /> <br />Eric Sloane's books are addicitng.  If you like this book, you will have a whole series of outstanding books to purchase.  In this same vein, I would also recommend the works of Edwin Tunis, another master illustrator an historian of America's material culture. <br /> <br />	2005-10-03

They coined the term \\"International Style\\" to describe this newly emerging style.  This show captured the imagination of many of the United States' best young architects and designers.  They soon began to put an American spin on the new \\"International Style\\" of architecture.    Eight years after the MOMA show, James and Katherine Ford published, \\"The Modern House in America\\".  The purpose of the book was to draw attention to this new style of architecture as it was being developed in the United States.  This volume was in turn republished by Dover Press in 1989 and retitled, \\"Classic Modern Homes of the Thirties\\".      This volume showcases sixty four designs by such noted architects as Neutra, Gropius, Breuer, Shindler and Soriano.  These works are shown with 194 photographs and 128 plans and drawings.  It is important to note, these images come from a book published in 1940 and therefore lack the precision and design values that you would find in a book published today. This reprint is not a coffee table style of book.  Its value is more historical in nature.    What I found most interesting in this book, is to see how some of the best homes of this period start taking on an iconic stature within a few years of being constructed.  Homes that are the subject of recently written monographs are shown as newly built homes.      Mid-Century Modern is all the rage at the current time.  There is no better volume to give an enthusiast an understanding of what forces came together to form this look.  To really know  Neutra, Schindler and Soriano, you have to know what they were building in the late 1930's.	2005-09-29

At first view, many of the photographs while though pleasant are not especially remarkable.  However, what makes these many photos special is that they are combined together to tell a story about houses are traditionally built around the world. <br /> <br />The photographs are gathered together in short chapters dealing with building techniques.  For example, the first three chapters are entitled, \\"Hand Coiling or Coursing Wet Earth\\", \\"Earthen Blocks\\", and \\"Compacted Earth\\".  Along with a cursory explanations of the building technique are numerous color pictures from around the world illustrating the different techniques. <br /> <br />What makes this such a great book is the sheer number of interesting photographs of vernacular architecture.  In a sense, this book is a momument to the creativity and artistic talent of the world's people.  These photos stimulate the imagination. <br /> <br />Finally, keep in mind this is a photo collection and not an academic text on vernacular architecture.  This is not a book on how to build by hand but a creative homage to what people can make with locally available materials and ancient know how.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-29

Norman Tyler's \\"Historic Preservation\\" was originally written as a text for a college class on historic preservation.  His purpose was to expose his students to the major themes in the field of preservation. <br /> <br />The book starts with a philosophical overview of preservation and moves onto chapters dealing with historic districts and the legal basis for preservation.  I found his chapter on the documentation and designation of individual historic properties to be most valuable.  Tyler concludes with chapters on design issues, preservation technology, downtown reviatalization and preservation economics. <br /> <br />This book is a well written introduction that will get you started in learning more about historic introduction.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-20

These two memoirs stand as book ends of the Legion experience. Although ten years seperate the two men's years of service, what really divides them is that Sloane remained with the Legion for his full five year enlistment contract whereas Salazar deserted after little more than a year of service.<br /><br />When Salazar joins the Legion, he is a BMW driving, 25 year old mechanical engineer who has dropped out of the corporate rat race.  His book does a good job of detailing the day to day experience of his year in the Legion.  All of the set pieces of a Legion memoir are in place.  In the end, Salazar does what is logical for a college educated, middle class person with plenty of options, he deserts the Legion.  Salazar's memoir is strong on details of Legion life but is weak on personal insight.  It is as though Salazar is still too close to his Legion experience to really understand his own motivations.<br /><br />Eric Sloane is on the other end of life experience.  At the age of Eighteen, he finds himself homeless and without a job in the South of France.  Having read Simon Murray's \\"Legionaire\\" a few years earlier, he decides that the promise of adventure is for him and he joins the Legion.  Unlike Salazar, Sloane stays in the Legion for the full five years.  He has a lot more ground to cover in his memoir.  While Sloane touches on the hard training and the brutal treatment, they are not the focus of his memoir.  Unlike Salazar, he does not chronicle every single injustice that befalls him.<br /><br />What elevates \\"The Naked Soldier\\" the highest tier of Legion memoirs is that it is primarily a story of Sloane's psychological state while in the Legion. This is the memoir of a wiser thrity four year old man looking back at his life when he was in his late teens and early twenties.  The memoir's strength is that Sloane is able to describe that poisonous mixture of anger, self-pity, naked agression and alienation all combined with copious amounts of alcohol and ugly sex.  While Salazar was attracted to this toxic mess, Sloane wallowed in it and absorbed it into his very being.<br /><br />I still think that Simon Murray's \\"Legionaire\\" and Christian Jenning's \\"Mouthful of Rocks\\" are the two great Legion memoirs.  However, \\"The Naked Soldier\\" and \\"Legion of the Damned\\" when read together give a more updated picture of what the Legion is like today.  Between the two books, I would choose \\"The Naked Soldier\\" because it is richer in the psycological insights.describe that poisonous mixture of anger, self-pity, naked agression and alienation all combined with copious amounts of alcohol and ugly sex.

There are two autobiographies that stand out as the very best examples of the genre.  On one end of the spectrum is Simon Murray's \\"Legionnaire\\", a heroic story of privileged Brit who ends up fighting in Algeria.  At the other end of the spectrum is Christian Jennings' \\"Mouthful fo Rocks\\", a self loathing but very funny Brit who ends up by deserting from the Legion. Unfortunately for Jaime Salazar, he falls into the camp of the deserters.    Salazar begins his journey as a 25 year old mechanical engineer straight out of Perdue University.  While driving around in his  new 5 series BMW, he realizes the corporate rat race is not for him.  He quits his job and heads to Europe for a little backpacking adventure.  While in France, he gets the strange notion of becoming a gentleman/private in the French Foreign Legion. Thus, the American college boy and former Yuppie begins his year long adventure in the Legion.    All the classic Legion scenes and characters are found in this memoir.  There is strenous basic training at the Farm, brutal and stupid NCO's, back breaking physical training and plenty of drinking stories.  Everything you would expect to be covered in a Legion tale is spelled out in vivid detail.    Like many a recruit, Salazar entered the Legion hoping for a Simon Murray experience and instead found a brutal peacetime Legion that specialized in devouring its own recruits.  In the course of a year, Salazar goes from being a would be Simon Murray hero to a Christian Jennings' deserter.  Salazar is refreshingly honest about his many failures and small triumphs inside the Legion.  He is at his best in describing the small details of how he tried to survive his many grueling experiences.  Unfortuantely, he lacks the funny self loathing and insights that Christian Jennings' brought to his story of deserting the Legion.  In a sense, he leaves the Legion as naive as when he entered.      For afficionados of the Legion memoir genre, this volume stands out because he is one of the few Americans who have recently written about his experience.  I think this may be the only American memoir that we will see for quite sometime.  In this post 9/11 world, any young American itching for adventure and a little trigger time, can find plenty of it in his own nation's army.      Although not a classic, Jaime Salazar does a credible job of telling his story of Legion life in the late 1990's.  I would recommend it to all afficionados of the genre and for naive young men who like to day dream of one day joining the Legion of the Damned.	2005-09-14

Both the quanity and quality of images in books have exploded in the past few years.  A great example of this is the book \\"Ship: the Epic Story of Maritime Adventure\\" by Brian Lavery and published by DK. There are literally hundreds of amazing drawings, paintings and wooden models of every ship type that you can imagine.    In contrast, when Edwin Tunis published this book in 1952, beautiful, high quality color illustrations were reserved for the most expensive books. Black and white line illustrations were the preferred and most economic method of illustrating picture books.  These were the types of books, that I grew up reading and loving in the 1960's and 1970's.      To be a successful line illustrator required great imagination.  The illustrations not only had to be top notch, the image had to be composed within an interesting context.  Edwin Tunis was one of the great masters of this style of illustration.  This book not only has great images of boats and ships but these vessels are doing interesting things.  As an example, his image of a whale boat shows a dead whale riding next to the ship while the crew is harvesting the whale's oil.  These were the types of details that enrichen illustations and help capture a reader's imagination.    Edwin Tunis was one of the great illustators of his day.  Be sure to look at his other books.  If you like Edwin Tunis, be sure to check out the works of Eric Sloane, another master illustrator.	2005-09-13

In this novel, it is a steam ship travelling to Japan.  A brilliant detective uses his powers of deduction to determine which of the suspects is the murderer.  But before the detective can make the collar, one of the suspects is murdered.  It all wraps up with the murderer being discovered in the act. <br /> <br />Boris Akunin and his great character Erast Fandorin bring nothing new to this tired plot line.  Agatha Christie owns this type of story and all authors who enter into her domain do so at their peril.  I really like Boris Akunin and Erast Fandorin and I will continue to read other books in the series.  However, Akunin made a big mistake in trying to re-imagine such a tired plot line.  If you are new to the series, do not start with this novel.	2005-09-12

This guide has many strikes against it.   <br /> <br />First, it is too short to give the reader any real understanding of the different styles of American domestic architecture.  Many styles are ignored and the styles that are covered are done so superficially.  As an example, the section on the International Style of architecture only has two washed out black and white photographs. The few details that are explained are done so in the most superficial manner. <br /> <br />Second, the quality of the printing is very poor.  The quality of the paper and binding makes the book look like it was produced int he 1970's. Worst of all, the photographs used to show the different styles are washed out.  A revolution in publishing has happened in the past twenty years and this publisher has missed out in the opportunity to produce a modern looking guide.  <br /> <br />Finally, there are some wonderful field guides in current production.  Don't waste your money on this guide.  Check out the guides produced by Lester Walker and Virginia McAlester.  Those are the types of guides that can inspire the reader to learn more about history and American houses.  Avoid this guide!	2005-09-12

It was a period where propeller driven P-51's and Corsairs battled with Mig 15's and Sabre aces shot down Yak 9's.  And of course, the huge jet battles that took place over the skies of Mig Alley.  A technological revolution took place during the four years of the conflict. <br /> <br />\\"Korean War Aces\\" by Robert Dorr is a plodding account of Korean Air War.  All the key phases of the war are covered.  Dorr dutifully documents all of the key facts. Every ace gets his due.  However, if you are interested in the human story of Korean Air War, this is not the book for you. It is a pity that such dramatic story is rendered in such lifeless manner.

In his book \\"Designing Dreams: Modern Architecture in the Movies\\", Donald Albrech explains how the futuristic theories of modernism were incorporated into movies. <br /> <br />Albrecht begins his book with a quick overview of modernist thought as it was developing in Europe in the years following the First World War. He then moves onto how these radical new ideas were embraced by the French and German film industry of the 1920's.  With the rise of facism, many of Europe great modernist artists and architects fled Europe and found a new home in the booming Hollywood film industry. <br /> <br />The section of the that I found most interesting was Albrect's description of modernist styles favored by the different American movie studios.  From the Bauhaus modernism of Paramount to the Streamline Modernism of MGM, Hollywood was an enthusiastic and early adopter of modernist tenants.  In Depression era United States, modernism was harbinger of a new and better age to come. <br /> <br />This book is filled with numerous photos of stage sets from the 1920's and 1930's.  It is a pleasure to see these idealized versions of the modernist credo.  By 1931, Philip Johnson could have a museum show in New York and herald the rise of a new \\"International Style\\" of architecture.  The value of this book is that it shows how cinema was the perfect incubtor and then spreader of modernist architectural thought througout the world.  A must have book for all those interested in the birth and spread of modernism.	2005-09-08

Right off the bat, the most negative thing about this book is that it is a Dover Publication Reprint.  This means the quality of the publication is mediocre.  Both the paper and binding are cheap.  The photo quality is decent.  This is no museum quality monograph on American Modernism.  If you have the money and interest, try to find the original publication.  I am sure that it is highly collectible.    The book is divided into nine chapters dealing with such fundamental decorative building blocks as, \\"The Shop\\", \\"Halls, Walls and Fittings\\" and \\"Graphic Arts in Advertising\\".  The text for these chapters were written by some great American Modernists of the 1930's.  There are short manifestos by such important artists as Kem Weber, Paul Frankl, Frank Lloyd Wright and Edward Steichen.  These short texts give the reader great insights into the American modernist mind of the 1930's.    The second strength of this book is the large number of black and white photos that illustrate the text.  The creations of such modernists as Von Nessen, Deskey, Rhode, Bel Geddes and Karasz are lovingly photographed.    This is a valuable book for anybody trying to gain a deeper understanding of American modernist thought in the 1920-30's.  This is a great second tier book for people who have read most of the contemporary books on the American take on Modernism such as \\"Depression Modern\\" and \\"American Modernism\\".

Written in 1805, the diary has short entries about Noah's life on a farm. Sloane uses these brief notations as a starting point to recreate a compelling story about farm life on the American frontier. Eric Soane's talent as an illustrator takes this book to the next level.  It is one thing to read about early American life and it is another level of pleasure to see beautiful illustrations that explain the material culture in which Noah Blake lived.<br /><br />The audience for this book is very large.  Written at a high school freshman level, this book will be of interest to anyone interested in learning how common people lived during the Federalist Period.  This book will also appeal to all those who are interested in the material culture of 19th Century America.  Sloane provides beautiful illustrations of how things like a water mill worked or how a simple wooden bridge was built.<br /><br />Personally, my interest in American vernacular architecture.  I loved this book because Eric Sloane has done a masterful job of explaining early American building techniques.  I knew that one had to be very knowledgable to survive 200 years ago and this book only reinforces my admiration for our ancestors.

Right off the bat, beware that this series has nothing in common with his beloved detective novels set in modern day Botswana.  It is hard to believe that he wrote too such different types of books. <br /> <br />The Portuguese Irregular Verb series of which \\"At the Villa Reduced Circumstances\\" is just one book can best be described as a droll send up on the absurdities of academic life.

This type of subtle humor is not for everyone.   <br /> <br />The books in the series do not need to be read in order.

This series includes books about Le Corbusier, Nuetra, Aalto and Gaudi to name but a few.   <br /> <br />The series follows a standard format.  They are 96 pages long and they begin with an introductory biographical chapter.  The books then move onto very short chapters that focus on the architect's iconic buildings.  The writing is concise and the photographs are first class.  The quality of publishing is up to the usual Taschen high standards. <br /> <br />Walter Gropius was one of the great architects of the Twentieth Century.  Love him or hate him, there can be no question that his influence on world culture was profound.  He was a powerful force in architecture and art for nearly 70 years.  If you want to be even minimally knowledgable about modern architecture, you have to know about Walter Gropius.  This book is a great introduction to the man and his work.  Once again, Taschen hits another home run.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-30

Photographic field guides are good in that you can see actual historic homes.  This is a valuable thing for people who like me live very far away from historic areas and rarely see a building over a hundred years old.   <br /> <br />However, the great problem with photographic field guides is that it is often times difficult to understand a building style by looking at one or two representative photographs.  What's worse is that often times the eye is drawn to details like electric lines or automobiles.  One can spend more time trying to identify the decade the photo was taken than on concentrating on the image. For this reason, I prefer field guides that use line drawings to represent buildings.  In my opinion, line drawings are a better tool for teaching the different architectural elements that come together to form a style. <br /> <br />Of the field guides that use line drawings, Lester Walker's \\"American Shelter\\" is the very best.  It is the best for two reasons.  First because of the sheer number of styles he identifies.  In this book he details 103 styles whereas a typical field guide will usually identifies 20-30 unique styles.  Second and foremost, Lester Walker is a very talented artist. His drawings are not hyper technical like the Historical American Building Survey (HABS) drawings which one finds in some field guides.  They have a lot of personality which seperates them from what I call the illustrator school of architectural drawings.   <br /> <br />I have been collecting field guides for a number of years and this is my favorite guide.  That is not to say that there are not other very high quality guides.  However, if you need to purchase just one field guide, this is the one.  Hopefully, this book will inspire you to start collecting architectural field guides which in my opinionis a most worthy hobby.	2005-08-16

Beware, there is very little in common between the two series.  The Number One Ladies Detective Series is very accesable to the general reading public.    The three novels of the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series are less accessable.  The main reason is that McCall Smith's humor is very dry. The delivery is so subtle as to border on the sublime.  This sort of absurdist humor about academic life is not for everyone.  If you like your humor direct and to the point, this is not the series for you.  If you like your humor really dry, this series is a delight.  However, if you are not sure, start the series with \\"The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs\\", the best of the three novels.	2005-08-15

I was drawn to this book because I wanted to increase my understanding of architecture by learning how the mechanical systems within buildings work.  I began this endeavor with E. Allen's  \\"How Buildings Work: The Natural Order of Architecture\\", perhaps the best introduction to the subject.  Having enjoyed that book, I wanted to get to the next level of complexity.    Esmond Reid's \\"Understanding Buildings\\"  is an intermediate level book.  The writing is at college freshman level and was easy to understand for a reader with no engineering or other technical background.  The many line drawings helped immeasurably in getting across basic points.      For the true beginner, I would recommend E. Allen's book.  If you like that work, \\"Understanding Buildings\\"  is an exciting progression in beginning to understand how the buildings we interact with on a daily basis work.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-14

I have always preferred line drawings because they allow the viewer to concentrate on the architecutral features that combine to create a distinct style.  I do not like photographic texts because there are too many distractions.  Instead of being able to concentrate on the house, the eye is drawn to trees, cars or people walking around. <br /> <br />Initially, I did not think that I would like \\"The Houses We Live In\\" because it relies heavily on photographic examples.  Even worse, the color on many of the 600 photographs look faded out.  The General Editor of the book, Jeffery Howe used his personal collection of photographs that he has amassed over the course of twenty years.  Unfortunatley, the photos look like the work of a weekend hobbyist.  (Yet let me say, they are still better than the \\"professional\\" photographs used in \\"The Abrams Guide to American Styles.\\" <br /> <br />Although initially biased against this book, having read the work I was won over by it.  Although not the highest quality of photographs, the sheer range of images is very impressive. Most field guides end around 1950.  This guide is interesting because it looks at contemporary revivals of classic American styles. In conclusion, this is the work of a man who has spent many years purusing his love of American architectural forms.  It is majestic in scope in the way only a committed hobbyist can complete.  Although not the ultimate field guide, Jeffery Howe and his collaborators have gone a long way in advancing the state of the architectural field guide.	2005-08-14

There is a certain truth to these observations but I think the best analogy for an American audience is that Erast Fandorin stories are a lot like the 1960's television show, \\"The Wild Wild West\\".<br /><br />Like the television series, the stories are set in a real time and place.  There are numerous references to real people and historical events.  However, there is a very unreal almost Victorian science fiction element to the stories.  In this novel, Fandorin battles against a secret organization whose intent is to dominate the world.<br /><br />It is a silly premis on which to base a novel and that is why I think the more serious reviewers are giving the novel only four stars.  However, I think one should think of this novel as a middle brow adventure story.  The novel is a lot of fun.  It is well written and the Russian back story holds a certain exotic appeal for non-Russians. To go back to using analogies, this novel reminds me of reading old Rafael Sabatini or P.C. Wren adventure novels.	2005-08-13

Almost all of the Guides break down into two camps.  The first group are the Guides that illustrate architectural styles through the use of photographs.  The second group of Guides show styles through the use of black and white line drawings.  Of the two camps, I prefer line drawings because they allow the reader to focus on the mulitple architectural details that come together to form an architectural style. <br /> <br />Gerald Foster's \\"American Houses\\" is a good example of the line drawing style of Field Guide.  Gerald Foster is a competent artist in what I call the illustrator school of architectural drawings.  He took highly detailed drawings from the Historic Architectural Building Survey (HABS)and rotated the drawings so as to center on a corner view. Hovering below the corner view is a representative floor plan. <br /> <br />The drawings are competent and pleasant to look at but where Foster falls short in my estimation is the sheer repetive nature of his drawings.  Almost all of the drawings are from this same corner view and after a while the view becomes monotonous.  A more imaginative artist would have shown buildings from different angles.  A good artist can bend static buildings and provide new insights into their construction. <br /> <br />The drawings are competent and George Foster has done enough homework in order to do a good job of describing the different styles.  Its a good Guide and if this is your fist Field Guide, you will be very happy with it.  However, there are better examples of Architectural Field Guides.  For this line drawing style of Field Guide, I would recommend Lester Walker's \\"American Home\\" and \\"The Visual Dictionary to American Architecture.\\"  The illustrations in these books are both more exciting and educational.	2005-08-09

In turn, the novel is divided into a 100+ very short chapters.  Alexander McCall Smith's intended audience was the Edinburgh newspaper readers who had to follow the novel on a daily basis.  Consequently, the novel is filled with insider references that Edinburgh readers would appreciate.  Afterall, it is always a little bit thrilling to see one's home town mentioned in a story.  All these inside references to neighborhoods and local politics are less interesting to a reader living in another country.    I am a loyal fan of Alexander McCall Smith.  His Number One Ladies Detective Agency novels are subperb and the Professor Von Igelfeld stories are some of the funniest stories that I have ever read.  Unfortunately, McCall Smith does not deliver in this novel.  The story line is jagged and many interesting threads are never persued.  There are some very humorous moments but all in all the novel is strangely disjointed.    Writing novels in daily or weekly chapters must be one of the most daunting tasks that any novelist can undertake.  Unfortunately, only the greatest writers can do this well.  Dumas and Dickens come to mind.  They were successful because they took on ambitious story lines with very wide scopes of detail and character.  McCall Smith fails in this novel because his scope is too narrow and pedestrian.  These small intimate Edinburgh stories are not made for daily newspaper deadlines.  Unfortunately, he could not realize this novel within the constraints of one newspaper column a day.  This would have been a much better novel, if he would have sat down and wrote it like a conventional novel.  It was an interesting experiment but he should stick to the format that best works for him.	2005-08-09

So it was into this already crowded field that \\"The Abrams Guide to American House Styles\\" was published in 2004.  In my opinion, if you are going to introduce a new book into an established field, you need to do something new.    This Guide has two features that are unique.  First, all of the photos are in color.  This is the first Guide that I have seen that has done this.  I really enjoyed seeing the photos of the earliest American homes.  Second, unlike most field guides, this Guide continues to the current day. I thought that adding examples of McMansions was a very nice touch.  Most other field guides stop somewhere around 1950.    Field Guides can be divided into photo books and line drawing books.  I prefer line drawing books because they help the reader concentrate on the architectural features that combine to make a style.  I think photo books are less effective because they are too specific.  Instead of concentrating on the stylistic details, the photos make the reader concentrate on a specific house.  The other reason I do not like photo books is that photos are inherently distracting.  Instead of concentrating on the architectural features, the eye is drawn to foilage, electrical poles, cars and people walking in front of the building.      The Abrams' Guides does a good job of cutting out most of the distractions but where if fails miserably is in the trees around the house.  A good 10-15% of the images are ruined by trees getting in the way of the photographer.  Either they block the full image or their shadow obscure key details.  I can accept a few trees around a house but to have so many photos ruined is unacceptable.  It as though the editors did not have enough photos and they were forced to accept poor quality photos to fill out the book.  If you want to see a field guide with beautiful color photographs of houses, see Robin Langley Sommer's \\"The American House\\".      If your tastes run to photos, purchase \\"A Field Guide to American Houses\\" by Virginia McAlester.  If you prefer line drawings like I do, check out, \\"The Visual Dictionary of American Architecture\\" or Lester Walker's \\"American Homes\\".    Looking at old homes and determining their sytles is a great hobby.  The Abram's Guide is a very poor introduction to this rewarding past time.	2005-08-08

I have collected architectural field guides for years and I can identify most building styles.  However, I had little idea how buildings worked.   <br /> <br />This book was enjoyable because the writing style was simple and straight to the point.  One does not need a technical background to get a lot out of the book.  Edward Allen's skillful line illustrations also add a great deal.  If I could not understand the technical description, the simple illustration helped me with the underlying principle. <br /> <br />To give you an example of why this book is helpful to a non-specialist.  I have heard of septic systems my entire life.  However, I had no idea how they worked.  With the help of very clear illustrations and straight forward writing, this mystery has been solved.  This book is a great introduction to all those interested in architecture.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-04

John Poppeliers was the head of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) and Allen Chambers was an historian with the Historic American Buildings Survey.  Quite simply they had access to 51,000 sheets of measured drawings, 156,000 large format black and white photographs and over 20,000 reproductions of individual items.  With all of that access, they could have produced the ultimate architectural field guide.  Instead they produced a 146 page superficial guide.    The best aspect of this guide are the line drawings produced for the Historic American Building Survey.  They are two dimensional drawings that are almost surgical in their precision.  The building photographs are also first class.The narrative describing the different elements of the style is short and to the point.    The second edition of this book was published in 2003.  In my opinion, if someone is going to introduce a new field guide into this already crowded arena, it has to offer something new.  I would recommend sticking with the already proven field guides by Lester Walker, Rachel Carley, Carole Rifkind or Virginia McAllister.      This book is recommended for people with really short attention spans.  This book is a dissapointment.  Oh, what it could have been.  One day, somebody from the HABS project will produce the ultimate architectural field guide.	2005-08-02

Hostages were being held in Iran, New York had almost declared bankruptcy and many of the nation's biggest cities were in severe decline. For better or worse, Ronald Reagan's new American dawn was about to rise.    The nattily clad, Tom Wolfe took all the obvious shots at modernism.  Most of these shots hit home because modernism was hitting its bloated and decrepit end. Twenty five years ago, it was pretty easy to kick modernism and make all the obvious snide remarks about $3,500 Barcelona chairs.  When it comes to kicking someone when they are down, Tom Wolfe has few peers.    However, from a distance of twenty five years, this book is something of a relic.  Only architectural historians and the cognoscenti care about the academic battle of Johnson, Venturi and Graves.  The reality is that the best of modernism has entered the realm of iconic and all the junk has been torn down or is rapidly falling into decline.  Wolfe can make all the snide remarks that he wants, but Mies and Gropius have entered into the realm of legend.  I seem to have forgotten, just who were the great post-modernist masters?  Face it, the Barcelona Chair is still really expensive and really cool.  Like generations of hipsters, I too am saving to purchase my first Barcelona Chair.  (Knoll of course.

They identify and categorize 39 different architectural styles.  This is much more than most field guides. <br /> <br />I have been collecting architectural field guides for a number of years.  The only thing I do not like in this well prepared book is the over-reliance on black and white photos of homes.  The quality of the photos vary significantly.  The photos are not of the same high caliber as the photos taken for Historic American Building Survey.(HABS) <br /> <br />I believe the best field guides are made up line drawings.  Line drawings get to the point and the different archiectural features can be labled.  The best line drawings really help in clarifying stylistic points.  Photos can be distracting because trees, power lines and vehicles end up in many of the photos.  There are line drawings in this book at the beginning of each section.  Unfortunately, the line drawings are the weakest part of the book. <br /> <br />This is a great book and you cannot go wrong with purchasing it.  However, as a devotee of these types of books, I would recommend purchasing Lester Walker's \\"American Shelter\\".  His illustrations are really beautiful and very informative.	2005-08-02

Many field guides to American homes concentrate solely on identifying a style.  Usually, there are only a few brief descriptions of the architectural details that help define a style.    What makes \\"The Visual Diction of American Domestic Architecture\\" such a pleasure is the sheer ambition of its coverage.  Not only are there detailed descriptions of building exteriors, there are also detailed desciptions of interior features.  As an example, not many field guides detail interior framing plans or such important features like staircases and fireplaces.  If that were not enough, there are also some representative floor plans.    I have been collecting field guides for a number of years and this is one of the best.  If you want to go beyond picking out key features of a distinct architectural style and want to delve deeper into building details, this is the book for you. Highly recommended.	2005-07-30

The best way to describe this new series stories is that they are very subtle farce about the world of academia.   <br /> <br />If you like the obvious and are looking for belly laughs, this is not the novel for you.  The tone is very quiet and borders on the absurd.  Portugues Irregular Verbs is the weakest of the three novels in the series.  The other two novels are comic masterpieces.  There is no need to read them in order.  I would start with the \\"Finer Points of Sausage Dogs\\" and then read the other two.  My final recommendation is to purchase the Audio CD.

It is very easy to associate the 1930's with Art Deco.  Many of the great buildings and public spaces of the time decorated building fascades with Art Deco motiffs.  However, most of the great American designers of the time disliked the overly ornate Art Deco style.  They thought the style was decadent and did not represent American democaratic values. <br /> <br />From the distance of 70 years, it is also possible to think that American designers were greatly influenced by European Modernism.  Although aware of Bauhaus, these American designers wanted to put an American twist on Modernism.  The result is what Martin Greif calls Depression Modern.  Others call this same style Streamline Modern or Moderne. <br /> <br />Depression Modern was first published in 1975 during the first Art Deco boom.  The tone of the book is iconoclastic.  Greif wanted to let the world know that the 1930's America was not all Art Deco.  This is a beautiful book with many great photos.  Although while not an art historian, I think the historical importance of this book is that Martin Greif was one of the first persons to start defining early American Modernism.  If one wants to understand Mid Centruy Modernism, it is important to look at the first manifestations of American Modernism.	2005-07-14

There is a wonderful noir feel to the book that would appeal to any fan of Alan Furst or Eric Ambler. <br /> <br />In a Maigret novel, there is almost no gun play or car chases.  It is just Chief Inspector Maigret doing what he does best, using his knowledge of human psychology to figure out a complex mystery. Picture in your mind Jules Maigret in a heavy coat and bowler hat wandering the streets of Paris puzzling out a mystery while he smokes his pipe.  <br /> <br />Georges Simenon wrote over 200 novels and more than 500 million copies of his books have been published worldwide.  He was able to do this because like Alexandre Dumas he almost limitless imagination.  If you have not read Simenon before, this is a good solid start.	2005-07-11

Unfortunately, the history of Irish expatriate soldiers is a very long and intricate story.  It is very difficult in one volume to cover the story from the years immediately following the Battle of the Boyne to the end of the American Civil War.<br /><br />Maurice Hennessy has a lot of history on his plate and unfortunately he does not have the narrative skill to elegantly wrap it all up in one volume.  Like many popular military histories written in the 1970's by non-historians, Hennessey touches on the high points but does not get very deep into the subject.  A person wanting to know more about the Wild Geese will have to read more specialized books about individual units and actions.  Finally, like many books written in the 1970's, the illustrations are relegated to a few black and white photos lumped together in several sections.  Publishing and printing has gone through technological revolution in the past three decades.  If you are looking for good illustrations, stick with the Osprey book.	2005-07-02

The novel's backdrop is the memorable seige of Plevna, a bloody precursor to the trench warfare that Europe would experience during the Great War.   <br /> <br />The hero of the novel is Erast Fandorin an agent of the Russian Secret Police charged with shutting down the network of a master Turkish spy.  The novel's greatest strength is the rich atmosphere in which Boris Akunin places his story.  With its haughty noblemen,dashing hussars and cosmospolitan foreign correspondents, I was reminded of Agatha Christie's Orient Express. <br /> <br />In my mind, The Turkish Gambit falls into the realm of the Victorian Adventure story.  Like Harry Flashman or Sydney Riley, Erast Fandorin travels the Victorian world going from one adventure to the next.  However, unlike Harry Flashman or a young Winston Churchill, Fandorin is never in the middle of the action.  In this novel, he spends most of his time in camp searching for the Turkish spy.  In temperment he is closer to Sherlock Holmes than Richard Burton.  It may sound callow but I would have given this novel five stars, if Fandorin had been a more physical character.  However, this is the first book in the series that I have read and I am impressed enough to purchase a second book. <br /> <br />For anyone else interested in the Russo Turkish War, I highly recommend Captain R.W. Von Herbert's, \\"The Defense of Plevna\\", a first hand account of the seige by an Englishman who served as a Turkish officer.  It is out of print but can easily be found.  This is a well written account in the same vein as Winston Churchill's early books.	2005-06-29

First and foremost, she has placed her series in a great time and place.  Fascist Spain just after Franco's victory over the Republicans has the right feel for devotees of the World War Two spy/detective novel.  The oppresive atmosphere feels just right for any Eric Ambler or Alan Furst reader. <br /> <br />Secondly, Carlos Tejada is also a unique and memorable character in that he is a humane and decent man who also happens to be an officer of Franco's dreaded Guardia Civil.  The paradox of a decent man who is not afraid to give a prisoner the third degree or serve the interests of a fascist police state make Tejada a unique character.  I cannot imagine a sympathetic Gestapo officer.  Pawel does a commendable job of creating a complex and believable character. <br /> <br />Interestingly, where Pawel falls short is in the actual mystery component of the story.  She has produced a novel with great atmostphere and characters and the story even has a romantic angle.  Where she is weak, is in the crime or the unsolved mystery which is at the very heart of any crime novel.  It is difficult to produce a truly great genre work, when such an important element is weak. Rebecca Pawel is a young writer with a lot of talent.  Hopefully, she will improve in this area.	2005-06-15

The focus of this books is post World War Two and more particularly the iconic buildings of the great architects.  There is nothing wrong about seeing more examples of the works of Mies, Gropius and Le Corbusier.  However, they influenced a great number of other architects who produced some very interesting buildings.  A style is a lot more than the creations of a few masters. <br /> <br />I love most of the architecture books published by the German Publishing Company, Taschen.  However, this is not one of their better books.  I found the text to be superficial and the photos not up to their usual high standards. <br /> <br />For anyone interested in learning more about early modernism and more specifically the International Style, I would recommend another Taschen book, \\"Architecture in the Twentieth Century\\" by Peter Gossel and Gabriele Leuthausser.	2005-06-05

First of all, she has set her story in a great time and place.  Its 1940 and France has just fallen to the Nazis and Spain is recovering from a protracted and brutal civil war.  Facism is spreading its terror throughout Western Europe.  This is the time and place where so many great suspense novelists like Eric Ambler and Alan Furst have planted their stories. <br /> <br />The hero/anti-hero is a fascist officer in the Guardia Civil.  Tejada is a complex hero.  He does not have a problem rounding up Reds and other fellow travellers.  Tejada is no stranger to obtaining information using the third degree.  However, he is not your standard fill in the blank evil (Gestapo, NKVD)totalitarian cop.  He may be serving a bankrupt regime but he has a nuanced view of the world. <br /> <br />Finally, Rebecca Pawel is a very talented writer.  She has all the gifts that the above average crime writer.  Her intelligence radiates throughout the story. <br /> <br />However, where things go wrong is when the novel loses its focus and drifts from being a crime novel into a love story.  The chemistry between the two lovers is good but in the end their love story douses out the essential crime element of the novel.  <br /> <br />My advice is start the series from the beginning.  One will have more patience with this story, if one has read the novel that goes before it.	2005-05-23

Read all five books in order.  The Man in the Iron Mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context.  Think of the Man in the Iron Mask as the dessert in a five course meal.  Dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable.  Getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that I was finishing a 3,500 page experience.<br /><br />2.  Read the Oxford University editions.  There are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events.  When you read 3,500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight.  The Introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter.<br /><br />3.  If you really like any one book in particular, go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection.  I purchased a used Three Musketeers with illustrations by Maurice Leloir.  The three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable.<br /><br />Along with Sir Walter Scott, Alexandre Dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel.  I have been reading these types of novels my entire life.  Beyond a doubt, Alexandre Dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre.	2005-05-04

Who would think that one of the best up and coming South American writers would be a Peruvian American from Birmingham, Alabama who writes in English.  What makes him a South American is that Alarcon is a gifted chronicler of life in Lima, Peru.  There is nothing nostalgic or romantacized about Alarcon's Lima.  It's Lima, La Horrible.  A grotesque, third world city that is for some odd reason is an almost charming city in its weirdness.      As an American going back to the city where he was born, Alarcon sees Lima in a way most Peruvians miss.  Alarcon has no need for magic realism.  Alarcon's protagonists are handyman thieves, unemployed bank clerks, dog killing revolutionaries and journalists who on occassion ride the city's buses dressed in clown outfits.  Throw in a parade of shoe shine boys and a Senderista or two and you have that strange mix that is modern day Lima.    Alarcon's short stories are precise and well written.  You can almost see the finger prints of the Iowa Writers Workshop.  This is a very good first collection of short stories for a young writer.  I am looking forward to seeing future books.  It will be interesting to see whether he stays a South American writer or turns his talents to the Latino immigrant experience in the United States.	2005-04-08

For nearly forty years, he was the center of American public life.  He literally carried the Revolution and the founding of the Nation on his back.  To do justice to his many achievements, it requires a multi-volume biography.   <br /> <br />Joseph Ellis has a lot of history to jam into this modest sized biography.  This book reminds of a college lecture because Ellis hits on all of the key points but does not have the time to flesh out too many of the more subtle details.  Although, I know very little of the period, his analysis of Washington's personality and career strikes me as being accurate.  Having finished the book, I feel that I have a good understanding of his many accomplishments.  However, I can't say that this biography left me satisfied. <br /> <br />This is not a book for those readers who love the old fashioned, almost panoramic scope of a well written traditional biography.  In this slender volume, there is not enough room to add the subtle details and background information that add weight and substance to the best biographies. Beyond a doubt, Ells is a competent historian but in the end he lacks the novelist's eye which the best biographers posses.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-04

The first two novels, The Three Musketeers and Twenty Years After exceeded my expectations.  They had all the sword play and adventure that I could have ever wanted.  I was thrilled with Dumas' many displays of writing virtuosity.  I have never read an author who could keep the level of excitement at such a high pitch for so long.<br /><br />Things start to change half way through Bragalonne.  The tone of the novel shifts from a story of high adventure to a novel of love and court life.  The first four hundred pages of Louise de la Valliere build upon these more domestic themes.  For my taste, there are too many chance encounters of lovers in front of the Royal Oak in the mystical woods of Fontainbleu.  At this point in the cycle, the tale of star struck lovers seems to come more out of a 17th Century French Drama than the three novels that immediately proceed it.<br /><br />However, all is not lost. Around page four hundred, Dumas comes to his senses and brings D'Artagnan, Porthos and Planchet back into the drama.  Their return breathes life back into the novel. Their presence along with Dumas' sheer genius as a story teller save what could have been a really boring novel.<br /><br />I am anticipating that the Man in the Iron Mask will meet all of my action/adventure needs.  The first four hundred pages of Louise de la Valliere is the dull spot one has to get through to finish the Three Musketeer cycle.	2005-03-18

It is simply amazing the way P.G. Wodehouse could always from the same well for his plot devises.  In a sense, all of the Wooster and Jeeves stories are a variation on the same theme. When Wodehouse is at his best, these comic novels reach the level of the sublime. Jeeves and the Mating Season as an example.  <br /> <br />This novel is very good but it lacks the way over the top element one can encounter in Wodehouse's best stories.  My understanding is that Wodehouse wrote over 90 books.  Like all things, some of them are better than others.  Sorting out the classics will be providing me with much amusements for many years to come. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend any recordings by Jonathan Cecil.  I have been listening to recorded books for over twenty years and he is simply the best reader that I have ever listened to.  He has amazing comic timing and I think the ultimate Bertie voice.  What Wodehouse is to the comic novel, Jonathan Cecil is the reading of comic novels.	2005-02-14

You are wondering if it is worth it to continue with the series.  If you decide to go on, you have three more 600+ page novels ahead of you.  That is a lot of time and energy.<br /><br />If you are foremost into the swashbuckling aspect of the Musketeer stories, I would not go forward.  The Musketeers are now in their late 50's.  They are still vital characters but they are no longer young men looking for any excuse to duel with the Cardinal's Guard.  From this point on, there is a lot less sword play and campaigning.  The focus of the story moves to the intrigues of Louis XIV court.<br /><br />I am continuing with the series because I like the characters.  I want to find out what happens to the four friends.  In this novel, D'Artagnan and Athos are the principal characters.  Aramis and Porthos do not show up for the first few hundred pages.  Dumas has kept me entertained for the first two thousand pages of this saga and I am counting on him to keep me entertained for the next 1500 pages.	2005-02-01

As this book opens, twenty years have passed since the death of Milady.  The Musketeer's youthful dreams have not quite panned out.  They are now in their forties and the world is much more complicated. <br /> <br />The most brilliant of the four friends D'Artagnan, is still only a lieutenant in the Kings Musketeers.  His talents have never been recognized. Although wealthy, Porthos is unhappy because his neighbors do not hold him in high esteem.  Although now an abbe, Aramis still is drawn to the world of the sword.  Only Athos seems to have found some peace as a country squire. <br /> <br />The four close friends have gone their separate ways.  They have not spoken or seen eachother for many years. However, France is on the verge of a civil war. D'Artagnan's desire for recognition and fortune leads him to bring the four old friends back together again for one more grand adventure. <br /> <br />I thought the Three Musketeers was one of the great adventure stories.  It is hard to believe but Twenty Years After is an even better book.  Dumas has the advantage of creating four great characters in the Three Musketeers.  Twenty Years After, gives Dumas another 800 pages to develop these memorable adventurers.  What made Dumas such a genius, is that he knew how to build a story to a high pitch and keep that high level of tension and excitement going for hundreds of pages.  This is truly a remarkable book.  The only down side to Twenty Years After is that I now have another 2100 pages to go before I end the five part Musketeer series. <br /> <br />	2005-01-04

At the beginning of the Golden Age, Spain had a prosperous Empire that stretched from the Phillipines in the East, to the Americas and southern Italy and the Flanders in Europe.  Her military and economic might reigned supreme.  Yet by the end of this century, Spain's power was in rapid decline.  The benefits of Empire slipped through Spain's hands like so many grains of sand. <br /> <br />At the same time that Spain's political and economic power were in decline, a Golden Age of Spanish culture was also taking place.  The Golden Age saw the rise of such prominent Spanish writers as the poets Miguel de Quevedo and Luis Gongora and the playwrites, Lope de Vega and Calderon de la Barca.  This is also the era of great Spanish painter Diego Velazquez. <br /> <br />So how do you examine an era of rich cultural achievements and simulataneous economic and political decline? The French Historian, Marcelin Defourneaux explores these contrasts by examining contemprary accounts of Spanish life.  We hear what travellers, playwrights and writers thought about every day life during the Golden Age.  There are interesting sections on student life, military service, concepts of honor and popular religion.  The final chapter on the role of the picaro in Spanish life is especially rich. <br /> <br />\\"Daily Life in Spain\\" is popular history.  After reading this book, one develops an \\"impression\\" of what life must have been like during this century.  This is not academic history and I would be surprised if it showed up in the bibliography of a serious work of Spanish history.   <br /> <br />However, what I found enjoyable about the book is to see how much of Golden Age culture has survived through the centuries. It is these cultural \\"survivals\\" that unite contemporary Latin America with Spain.  At times when Defourneaux was describing Seventeenth Century Spain, he could have been talking about current day rural Chihuahua.  Itis always interesting to see how the past shapes our current lives. <br />	2004-12-14

His clients include irate husbands and lenders who have problems collecting their debts.  Capitan Alatriste is the archetypal veteran warrior home from the wars.  He is skilled in his craft and he lives quietly by his warrior's code.  We have all seen this character played in numerous movies by Toshiro Mifune, Clint Eastwood and Gary Cooper.<br /><br />What makes the Diego Alatriste character interesting and sets him apart, is that he is an active participant in Spain's Golden Age.  His friends include the poet Miguel de Quevedo, the dramatist Lope de Vega and the young painter Diego Velasquez.  With this novel, the reader gets both a good swashbuckling adventure and a history lesson.  This is one of those novels where the atmosphere is as good as the action.<br /><br />At 237 pages, this is a very accessable novel for non native speakers of Spanish.  One needs only a few years of college Spanish and access to a good dictionary to look up the more archaic Spanish terms.  For those interested in reading the whole Alatriste series, I would recommend reading Marcelin Defourneaux's \\"Daily Life in Spain during the Golden Age\\".  This will help put the series in its proper context.	2004-12-01

He solves his crimes because he has deep understanding human nature and the psychic abberations that can lead to murder.  The pleasure of a good Maigret story is to watch him through the use of skillful interrogations and crime scene investigation solve complex mysteries. <br /> <br />In this story, Jules Maigret's boyhood friend whom he has not seen in 20 years comes to ask for help.  The former class clown, is now the kept man of a kept woman. She is murdered and he is afraid that he will be arrested.

I am a fan of the British suspense story.  There is a long tradition of excellence starting with John Buchan and continuing with his many heirs including Eric Ambler, Alfred Hitchcock and John Le Carre.  I had hoped that for me, Graham Greene would somehow fit somewhere in this continuum.    \\"Ministry of Fear\\" has a clever enough plot.  Set in London during the Blitz, there are the usual plot twists of mistaken identities and unpleasant foreign agents.  I am almost embarrassed to admit this but where Greene lost me, was with his writing style.  What Eric Ambler can say in a sentence or two, Greene does the same in a long complex paragraph.  I found the plot with its clever twists and turns to be almost Gothic in its complexity. In my opinion the best suspense stories are almost economical in their description of time and place.  The best writers let the reader's imagination fill in the details.    There is no doubt that Graham Greene is one of the major novelists of the Twentieth Century.  However, World War Two spy thriller is better done on film by Orson Welles or Alfred Hitchcock and in the book form by Eric Ambler and Alan Furst.  The Ministry of Fear is very clever but unfortunately not my cup of tea.	2004-10-07
US	52661151	R15GB90FUFD60J	0399151850	495037638	The Queen of the South (Perez-Reverte, Arturo)	Books	4	11	12	N	Y	An Updated Godfather Story	In Queen of the South, Arturo Perez Reverte has moved from the rarified world of antique book sellers (Club Dumas), art historians,(Flanders Panel) and duelists (Fencing Master) to the gritty world of international drug trafficking.  With this novel, Perez Reverte capitalizes in our fascination with crime.  Not crime as practiced by the legions of petty criminals but high crime as practiced by international drug smugglers and mafia dons.    The novel's hero, Teresa Mendoza begins her story as the girl friend of a small time Mexican narco.  With his murder, she is forced to flee Mexico.  She works her way up from a barkeep in Spanish Morocco to the \\"Queen of the South\\", the most important smuggler of drugs in the Mediterranean. All this, in only twelve years.    Perez Reverte is an old fashioned story teller in the 19th Century tradition of Dumas or Hugo.  He is very talented writer and uses all of his consierable skill to keep this story moving.  There are plenty of well written scenes that get the heart beating and the hairs on the back of the neck to stand up.  If I were rating this story on sheer writing talent, the Queen of the South would get five plus stars.    However, what keeps the Queen of the South from being a really good novel is the sense that the story is not plausable.  For this type of story to work, Perez Reverte should take his cue from Mexico's Narco Corridos.  At the end of a ballad by Los Tigres del Norte, you can always turn to the person sitting next to you and say, \\"Dicen que fue cierto\\" or They say it really happened.      The first two thirds of the novel are terrific.  Perez Reverte has the feel of Sinaloa and the Straights of Gibralter just right.  He started to lose me once Teresa begins her meteoric rise to the top of the drug trade. It is as though she goes from being a three dimensional character to a stereotype of a drug lord. It is as though Perez Reverte lost his story telling nerve.    In the greatest novel of this genre \\"The Godfather\\", Mario Puzo understood the importance of taking his time to tell the story of the rise of Vito Corleone. Like Teresa Mendoza, Vito Corleone must flee his homeland to escape assasins.  Through cunning, hard work and violence, he rises from obscurity to become the head of a crime organization.  Don Corleone's rise to power takes decades and his wholly believable.  He is a believable character from start to finish.  The Godfather in both its novel and movie form will be around for generations.  While a good read, The Queen of the South's destiny is to be an ephemeral novel.  Unfortunately, Perez Reverte did not have the nerve to make this a great novel.	2004-10-01

These autobiographies range from officer perspectives like Prince Aage of Denmark's, \\"My Life in the Foreign Legion\\" to the stories of hardscrabble Eastern Europeans like Aparvay's \\"A Legionnaire's Journey\\" and Ehle's, \\"The Survivor\\".<br /><br />Within this genre, there is an even more interesting subset of English Legionnaire memoirs.  On one end of the continuum, there is Simon Murray's \\"Legionnaire\\".  His story is of the upper class Englishman who joins the Legion to impress a woman and ends up fighting guerillas in the mountains of Algeria. Murray's account is the classic Foreign Legion tale of adventure and suffering. On the other end of the continuum is Christian Jennings' \\"A Mouthful of Rocks\\".  Whereas, Simon Murray is brave and heroic, Jennings is a very charming petty thief, liar and deserter. His peace time Legion is filled with losers and malcontents.  Heroics is replaced with humor.<br /><br />Bill Parris', \\"The Making of a Legionnaire, falls somewhere in the middle of continuum.  He is an ex-military man who joins the Legion because of family problems.  All of the classic scenes of the Foreign Legion Memoir are present.  There is the mandatory enlistment scene where the recruit knocks on the Garrison door and enters into the foreboding world of the Legion. He then proceeds onto the brutal basic training with its customary physical harshness and tough NCO's.  As to be expected, Parris includes the mandatory Camerone Day and Christmas Celebrations.  Bill Parris is the classic motivated professional soldier who after basic training moves onto the Second Parachute Regiment, the elite regiment in an elite force.<br /><br />It is at this point, his editors really start to fail Bill Parris.  As a member of the Parachute Regiment he goes onto to fight in Rwanda and in Chad.  Unfortunately, these two interesting stories only get superficial treatment.  It is as thought the memoir runs out of steam when it starts to get really interesting.<br /><br />The \\"Golden Years\\" of the Legion fighting in North Africa and Indochina are over.  Intervening in small Central African conflicts is what the Legion now does for a living.  Illuminating this experience could have made this memoir very interesting.  As it is, \\"The Making of a Legonnaire\\" is a good book.  Parris is a good story teller and is honest with himself and his audience.  This is a good first time book for a person interested in the contemporary Legion.  Unforuntately, afficionados of the Legion Memoir, will be a bit dissapointed.nt.

However, I must admit to some trepidation as I read the first few chapters of the book.  There were elements of the story that seemed to be very familiar.  Once again, Easy Rawlins was being coerced by the police to search for someone in South Central Los Angeles.  In tone and substance, it looked like Walter Moseley was going to go down a well worn path.  I feared that he was beginning to rely too much on \\"formulas\\". <br /> <br />Having finished the book, I still think that Mosely is relying on forumlas and that he goes back to too many of the same characters and stock situations.  Nevertheless, Mosely is such a strong writer and Easy Rawlins such a great character that Walter Mosely is able to pull it off.   <br /> <br />Mosely's strength is not in his plots.  It is the character of Easy Rawlins that makes me purchase each new book as soon as they come out.  Through Easy Rawlins, we are able to enter the mind of an African American man living in Los Angeles in the post war years.  Rawlins lives and operates in a pressure cooker.  He has to deal not only with the racism and pressure of the white world but also the dysfunction and violence of his own people. It is simply fascinating to see how Easy Rawlins survives and even prospers in such an unremittingly harsh environment.  It is Easy Rawlins the thinker and philosopher that sets him apart from so many other characters. <br /> <br />As an outsider, Walter Mosely has given me entree into a different world.  His descriptions of 1960's Los Angeles gives me new insights into the current experience of African Americans.  There are not a lot of mystery writers who can offer so much.	2004-09-14

He understood the true nature of facism and communism and Ambler placed his stories right in the center of the struggle between good and evil.  Fortunately for us, Eric Ambler was able to move beyond the Second World War. During the 1950's, Ambler turned his gaze and considerable talents to the topic of decolonization. Through his stories, Ambler was able to keep current with the big stories and issues of the day. <br /> <br />A Passage of Arms was first published in 1959.  Southesast Asia was going through difficult times.  The French had been kicked out of Indochina and the Americans were just coming in.  In Indonesia, tensions were growing between the Communists and Muslem nationalists.  The English had just beaten back a Communist insurgency in Malaysia.  This is the turbulent world encountered by two would-be American arms dealers who take a break from their cruise around the world. <br /> <br />At its essence, 'A Passage of Arms' is a business tale.  We follow the passage of a cache of weapons as they travel from the jungles of Malaysia to the port city of Singapore.  There are numerous side trips to Hong Kong, Manila and Indonesia. This novel offers great insights into the murky world of arms dealing. <br /> <br />Although, while not as sexy as some of his World War Two thrillers, in a 'Passage to Arms', Eric Ambler is at the top of his game.  There is a reason why a novel written in 1959 is being reissued in 2004.	2004-09-07

This intrigued me because the Gothic Novel is such an Anglo American creation.  Fog enveloped castles, maidens in distress and werewolves come to mind.  I had never heard of a Spanish language Gothic Novel.  How would a Mediterrean sensibility play out in such a different genre?<br /><br />The novel starts out well.  The setting is Barcelona in the years immediately following the Civil War.  On the day a young boy can no longer remember the face of his dead mother, he is taken to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books where he finds a book that will change his life.  Later on, he encounters a faceless man in search of the same book.  A pretty good start to a Gothic Novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ruiz Zafon then loses his nerve.  The story degenerates from Gothic Tale to Telenovela.  He does this by peopling his story with stock Telenovela characters.  The side kick with a heart of gold, the evil character dressed in a black trench coat and the beautiful blond love interest.  Soon the story is filled with stock characters going through the motions.  Whatever potential this novel had to do something different is lost in the same old platitudes.<br /><br />I love Telenovelas.  They tell fun stories and they make time go by quickly.  The Shadow of the Wind is good old fashioned Telenovela.  It is a fun book but Ruiz Zafon is not in the same league as Dickens or Dumas.  I would put him in the league of Dan Brown of the Da Vinci Code fame.  If you want to read a good contemporary Spanish novelist with something interesting to say, check out the works of Arturo Perez Reverte.	2004-08-30

So it was with great pleasure that I placed a pre-release order for Dark Voyage with Amazon.  I have loved all of his spy novels and I think Alan Furst is the legitmate heir to the great suspense novelists, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Dark Voyage is in my opinion the weakest of his many excellent novels. What I love about an Alan Furst spy story is the sense of clausterphobia that all of his protagonists operate under in wartime Europe.  Discovery and certain death are just one step away in the guise of a nosey train conductor or a Nazi radio van driving down the block.  His protagonists are always under great pressure as they criss cross the depressing towns and cities of occupied Europe.  You have to love a writer who takes us to the Carpathian Mountains and Bulgarian river towns. <br /> <br />Dark Voyage centers around the voyages of a Dutch tramp steamer during the dark days of 1941. Instead of rooting his story in one exotic locale where he can really develop his plot, Furst has his protagonists bouncing all over North Africa, Crete, Lisbon and the Baltic.  The life aboard a tramp steamer becomes as important to the story as the spy missions the ship is carrying out.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, all of the stock characters that one finds in the tramp steamer story are present.  I can easily see Humphrey Bogart as the Captain, Marlene Deitchrich as the Russian Refugee/love interest and Peter Lorre as the Swiss Spy.  And in turn, all of the stock plot devices are also evident, the U-Boat, the naval mine and the Nazi patrol boat.  I have seen this all before in the Guns of Navarone, Casablanca and The African Queen.  One could only have hoped that Alan Furst could have used his considerable talent to re-imagine the tramp steamship story.  One need only read the great Colombian master, Alvaro Mutis to seewhat can be done with the tramp steamship story. <br /> <br />Alan Furst has found his niche as a writer.  I can only hope that he does not become too complacent.  Both Eric Ambler and Graham Greene moved beyond the World War Two espionage novel.	2004-08-29

It was one of those books that I hated finishing.  Every chapter brimmed with wonderful anecdotes and stellar writing.  I put \\"Dreadnought\\" right up there with Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August\\" as one of the classic accounts of the Great War. <br /> <br />At 780 pages, \\"Castles of Steel\\" requires an act of faith to pick up the book and begin reading.  Fortunately, Massie delivers a well written account of the naval war between Great Britain and Germany.  All of the major sea battles of the war are examined with careful but not pedantic detail.  Fortunately, as a work of popular history, Massie does not need to bog down his story with the obscure details an academic history would have to include.  There will probably never be a better written popular account of the Great War at Sea. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Robert Massie has to crowd in an awful lot of history into his 780 pages. What gets lost in his account is the well told anecdote and the rich background detail that made \\"Dreadnought\\" such a pleasure to read. There is just enough background writing to make one miss reading \\"Dreadnought\\".  \\"Castles of Steel\\" would have had to push on a thousand pages to fill it with the same level of detail.  To give but one example, Massie never informs his reader about simple details such as what is the difference between a light cruiser, a fast cruiser and a battle cruiser.  The maps and pictures also do not do justice to the story being told. <br /> <br />All in all this is a very good acccount of naval warfare during the Great War.  I will probably never have to read another book on this subject.  However, \\"Castles of Steel\\" does not rise to the level of classic like \\"Dreadnought\\" or \\"The Guns of August.\\"  I would be willing to bet that in 40 years, \\"Dreadnought\\" will still be in print and \\"Castles of Steel\\" will only be found in libraries.	2004-08-21

There is some French language text accompanying the photos.  The text supposses that the reader has a general idea of went on during the war.  This book is not a good place to start learning about the French experience in Indochina.   <br /> <br />This book is published by the French publishing company of Lavauzelle.  Like all Lavauzelle books, the graphic quality of the book is very high.  Lavauzelle produces some of the best militaria books in the world.  Book publishing is one of things the French do very well. <br /> <br />Unlike Rene Bail's books, the photos in this book are of a very high quality.  They look as though they were taken by professional journalists.  Guerre sans fin does not have the scrap book feel of other photo collections of the first Indochinese War.  This book is a good value and a must purchase for all those interested in the material culture and atmosphere of the First Indochinese War.	2004-07-29

The book is a complilation of more than 500 black and white photos.  Most of the photos appear to be from the very first years of the war.  There are French language descriptions of each photo and a few half page vignettes.  This book was published in 1988 by Editions Heimdal. The reproduction quality of the photos is mediocre at best.  It looks like a book from the 1980's. <br /> <br />This is not a book for anybody who wants to read about the first Indochinese war.  My sense of the text is that the author is very conservative and still bitter about the war.  The value of this book is in the random assortment of photos.  It has the feel of a scrap book or a photo album.  While there are a number of combat photos there are also a lot of photos of the ordinary.  There are pictures of soccer games, pagodas, native girls and hospital ships.  Most of the photos are small snippets of life in the late 1940's in Indochina.  The photos are ordinary but still very fascinating.   <br /> <br />If you like the era and its history and you are interested in the material culture of the time, this is a great book.  The value of the photos is in their sheer ordinariness.  I found the quotidian in an extraordinary times to be very interesting.	2004-07-27

One of the few books that has gone deeper into the subject was Tony Horowitz' Conferates in the Attic.  Horowitz used the story of a colorful hardcore reenactor to examine America's fascination with its Civil War.  His approach was typical of the &quot;New Journalist&quot; style of writing. Although a participant and observor, Horowitz was ultimately a talented journalist in pursuit of a good story.  Reenacting was the vehicle he used to tell his tale.<br />Jenny Thompson was also a participant observor in search of an interesting story.  She spent seven years going to reenacting events and joined several reenacting units.  Thompson used her training as a scholar to produce Reenacting's first ethnography.  As a social scientist, her objectives were much more amibitious than Tony Horowitz.  Thompson wants to explain the hobby of reenacting and the motivations of the people who participate in the hobby.<br />I would not recommend this book for anyone who is impatient with intellectuals and scholarly discourse.  By its very nature, an ethnography is a set of generalizations that are used as a tool to find deeper meanings.  I would suspect that many people in the reenacting community would find this book to be overly intellectual.<br />What I found to be so interesting about this book is that it is the first time that I have ever come across a book that discusses the motivations of what must be a decent percentage of the American male population that is fascinated by the many facets of war.  As one of these people, on an intellectual basis, I know that war is a tragedy and that I would never want to participate in a war.  Nevertheless, I am fascinated by military history and war's material culture.  Although, I am not a Twentieth Century reenactor, this book nevertheless still spoke to me. I saw a lot of myslef in the people Thompson writes about.	2004-07-17

The wreck may be tragic but its compelling and you have to slow down and look.  Poor France, to have gone from the pretensions of World Empire to being the junior partner in the Franco German partnership.  What a glorious, slow motion train wreck!  A tragedy given malicious pleasure by Gaullist pretensions.<br />For enthusiasts of French military history, there are a number of great books in English that chronicle this steep decline.  Many of these books mention the role of the intelligence. However,like Logistics, the role of Intelligence gets lost in the sexier story of battles and campaigns.  Douglas Porch's \\"The French Secret Services\\" is the first book in English that looks at the role of the Intelligence and the Secret Services from the Dreyfus Affair to the Rainbow Warrior catastrophe.  The hardback edition is 500 pages and has a lot of ground to cover.<br />Every chapter helps fill in the the peculiar details of French history.  I thought the three chapters on the Indochina War were especially good.  Porch does an admirable job of detailing the importance of the opium trade and its role in the Dien Bien Phu catastrophe.  I wish that somebody in the Pentagon would read Porch's two chapters on the Algerian War. Porch has a lot of interesting things to say about use of torture and direct action by Intelligence Services.<br />Porch's book is a survey of a hundred years of history.  By its very nature, it cannot spend too much time on any one subject.  To enjoy this book, the reader needs to have a good understanding of French history in the Twentieth Century.  Without this knowledge, this book would be very hard to understand.  <br />Along with Anthony Clayton, Douglas Porch is one of the great historians of French military history.  His books on the French Foreign Legion, the Conquest of Morocco and the exploration of the Sahara are classics.His strength as a writer and story teller comes out when he is able to wrap his story around a discrete series of events.  A survey history does not lend itself to Porch's talents.  Having finished this book, I can only hope that Douglas Porch will one day turn his formidable talents to the French Wars of Decolonization. Douglas Porch is the perfect historian to update Bernard Fall and Alistair Horne.	2004-06-09

This lightness allows one to go on a Maigret binge where in the course of a week, two or three novels can polished off.<br />Miagret's Christmas is a collection of nine short stories.  Some of the short stories are not so short, they are more like novellas.  At 320 pages of small print, this book is by no means light reading.  It took me a couple of weeks to finish the book.<br />Of the nine stories, I found four of them to be classic Georges Simenon.  They were world class in their cleverness.  The other five were good but not great.  However, Georges Simenon's good is most writers very best.  All and all a great book but a bit of slog.	2004-05-22

Political parties are threatening to pull out of the governing coalition.  And as usual, the Ministry of the Interior is at war with the Ministry of Defense.  In other words, a typical day in the Byzantine world of Italian politics.<br />The book begins with the discovery of a soldier's body in a military tunnel complex high in the Italian Alps.  A routine autopsy is interrupted when the Carbinieri steal the body in the early morning hours from the hospital's morgue. The Army is spooked and Aurelio Zen's bosses in the Ministry of the Interior sense an opportunity to embarass the Army.  Thus in the ninth book of this venerable series, Aurelio Zen is sent off to do battle with yet another powerful and corrupt Italian institution. <br />What makes the Aurelio Zen series so pleasurable is that the traditional Anglo American mystery genre is undermined by a Latin sensibility.  In the Anglo American mystery, the world is a logical and ultimately benign place.  With hard work and intuition, the Anglo American detective can resolve the mystery.  The guilty are punished and harmony and balance are restored.  <br />Aurelio Zen's world operates on different principles.  In Zen's Italy, the powerful are corrupt and masterful in their use of violence and intimidation.  Nothing is transparent.  Motives are obscure and conspiracies are the preferred mediums for achieving objectives.  Zen is a good man but he will do whatever it takes to survive in this harsh and unforgiving environemnt.<br />For those interested in the Latin sensibility, check out the Scicilian mystery writer Leonardo Sciascia or the Mexican writer Paco Ignacio Taibo.  For the French take on this Latin sensibility, there is the master Goerges Simenon's Inspector Maigret.  The Columbian writer Alvaro Mutis puts a magical realism spin on this sensibility.	2004-04-25

For me, the ideal crime fiction novel takes four to five hours to knock out.  I like the stock plots with the heroes from central casting.  <br />This is my first P.D. James crime novel and what a pleasant discovery it has been.  The Murder Room is at the other end of the crime fiction spectrum.  Whereas, Eric Ambler or Georges Simenon economically sketch out their tales, P.D. James takes the time to build the back story and flush out even the minor characters.  James is not in a rush to tell her story.  She has the patience and talent to elevate the humble crime story to another luxurious level.  <br />The Murder Room is a book to sit back and enjoy. There is no need to rush this pleasure. If you can afford the CD's, Charles Keating's great voice only adds to the sensory pleasure.  All in all, a decadent treat.	2004-04-13

There are never any shades of brown.<br />Fittingly, this book is devided into two sections.  Dickerson begins by positing the the white supremacist dialectic that white behavior is the norm and that black behavior is the pathology. She goes onto argue that white supremacists and black polemicists work together to engage in this warped and ultimately self destructive dialogue.<br />Dickerson is at her strongest in discussing the deep narcisism that is at the heart of white racism.  She believes that most white people are incapable of coming to grips with our nation's shameful history of race relations.  Dickerson argues that blacks must recognize this deep seated intransgience and then move on.   It is a waste of time and emotional energy to ask white America to acknowledge its failures.<br />The second part of the book delves into the unhealthy dance that black America has with white racism.  In this post movement era, Dickerson believes the need for group action and group thought is over.  She wants blacks to put white racism out of their minds.  Dickerson argues the best remedy for white racism can be only found in individual black achievement.<br />Anybody who argues that Dickerson is some sort of neo-conservative has obviously not read the book.  She has triggered anger in the black community because of her critique of the established black leadership.  One should not be surprised that a Harvard educated lawyer in her early forties should have a different view of the world that her elders of the civil rights generation.  In another twenty years, a younger generation will critique Dickerson's generation.  <br />Debra Dickerson is a gifted writer.  Her book is both thoughtful and entertaining.  However, I think it would have been stronger if an editor had cut out 20-30 pages that wander off from her main points.  I also think her book would have been much better, if she acknowledged that the United States is truly a multi-cultural nation.  Ironically, her need to shape her arguments in a black white dialectic shows that she is a prisoner of the black white paradigm that she is attempting to escape.  All and all it is a good book.  It could have been a great book if Dickerson had a better editor.	2004-03-13

A crime takes place and the hero methodically advances step by step to unravel the mystery.  The pleasure in these stories is observing the hero's clever reasoning as he solves the puzzle.  The procedural detective story usually ends with evil being punished and balance returned to a decent world.<br />Leonardo Sciascia's Equal Danger comes from another tradition.  The Latin Detective Novel has some procedural elements in it but the focus is a meditation on the nature of society.  Sciascia begins his novel by quoting Rousseau, &quot;...Tell me where on earth their exists a country where it is a crime to keep one's given word and to be generous, where the good man is despised and the wicked man is honored.&quot;  <br />As a Scicilian, this world of corruption and silent complicity is all too familiar to Sciascia.  On the surface, Equal Danger is story about the search for a serial killer of judges and prosecuting attorneys.  Below the surface, this is metaphysical detective novel that tries to give insight into a failed civil society.<br />Although elegantly written, Equal Danger is not light reading.  If one is interested in the Latin Detective Novel, read the more accessable Michael Dibdin, Rubem Fonseca or Paco Ignacio Taibo.  Sciascia is more difficult to read and understand but he is well worth the effort.	2004-02-14

He saw the evil of facism spreading throughout Europe and used contemporary events as the backdrops for his stories.  His stories incorporate the struggle between the liberal values of the Western Democracies and the warped values of the facist police state.  With perfect hind sight, we know that Eric Ambler got it right.  He was no appeaser and had no problems in knowing and saying that Nazi Germany and Facist Italy were deeply evil states.<br />After the Second World War, Ambler's first books picked up many of the same themes he developed in his pre-war stories.  The locale shifted from Western Europe to the newly Communist Eastern Europe and Balkans.  Ambler knew evil when he saw facism and he recognized it again in the newly totalitarian Communist police states.  Ambler was no fellow traveler and once again history showed that he was right in his assesment.<br />State of Seige was written in 1956 and takes place in a newly independent Southeast Asian nation.  An Islamic Fundamentalist military coup is taking place, and an English engineer gets front row seats to the proceedings. <br />This book was published two years after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu and during the middle of Britain's sucessful anti-communist struggle in Malaysia.  With his usual nose for being in the right place at the right time, Ambler gives us his take on the newly indpendent nations of Southeast Asia.  Without giving too much away, Ambler once again got it right in his assesment of history.<br />As usual, Ambler's writing is elegant.  State of Seige is a straight forward story and lacks the usual Ambler twists and turns.  It is both a great suspense story and an opportunity to see how an English writer viewed the end of colonialism.  It is an interesting take on the post colonial world worthy of Graham Greene or Jean Larteguy.	2004-02-10

If you are looking for a biography of Frederick, this book is not for you.  If you are looking for detailed orders of battle or blow by blow descriptions of key battles, look somewhere else.  If you are interested in foreign policy or intellectual history, this book is not for you.<br />However, if you want a well written overview of Fredericks' many struggles, this book is perfect.  Dennis Showalter is America's foremost expert on German military history.  I found this book to be a great introduction to Frederick the Great and the Prussian Army he created.  Showalter is a great writer who has the confidence to inject a little humor into his work.<br />If you are new to Warfare in the Age of Reason, this book is a first rate introduction.  If you like the history and you want to read more, move onto the more complex works of the equally talented Christopher Duffy.	2004-01-11

I have read all of the recent Ambler re-issues put out by Vintage Crime/Black Lizard and I think this is his weakest book.  I would recommend it to an Ambler fan but it is not the best book to start with.<br />Although the story is good, it has none of the over the top flair of A Coffin for Dimitrios or Journey into Fear nor any of the weirdness of Judgement on Deltchev.  In style, this book reminds me more of Epitaph for a Spy.  It is a good procedural type story but the ultimate pay off just was not there for me.<br />Eric Ambler is a master of espionage genre.  Even his weaker efforts are a lot better than most of the books coming out today.	2004-01-10

Ambler began writing his spy novels in the 1930's and continued through the 1970's.  Most of his early work was set in Europe as the dark shadow of facism was falling on the Continent.<br />Judgment on Deltchev was in written in 1949.  With the end of the Second World War, Facism had been defeated and the new spectre of Communism was beginning to fall over Eastern Europe.  This tale is set in an un-named Eastern European country shortly after the end of World War Two.  The Communist Party has recently seized power and they are putting the respected leader of an opposition party on trial.  With the backdrop of a political show trial, an underground stuggle is taking place to determine who will really run the country.  It is into this highly charged atmosphere that Foster, an English journalist covering the political trial arrives.<br />Eric Ambler is a master stylist.  His writing is economical and he effortly produces a story of complicated political intrigue.  Ambler's writing is a great example of how less can be more.  There are many contemporary writers producing espionage tales set during the Second World War and the years immediately following it.  Ambler was the first master of this genre and he set a very high bar.	2003-12-08

In terms of landmass, this struggle ranged continously from Mexico down in Chile and Argentina.  During this fifteen year conflict, several hundred thousand people died.  Major battles were fought in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile and Peru.  A once tranquil Empire was devastated and a host of new nations arose from the destruction.<br />The Liberation of Latin America is an epic story and the strategy that Robert Harvey uses to tell it is to focus on the lives of the key leaders of the struggle.  In this book, we meet the great Liberator, Simon Bolivar, the Protector Jose de San Martin, the Scotish Sea-Wolf Lord Cochrane, the nobel Sucre, the indomitable Padre Hidalgo and finally the Emperor and Freedom Fighter Dom Pedro I.  Truly a cast of larger than life characters.<br />Robert Harvey has written a popular history for the general public.  This book is not likely to end up as a college text book nor will it be respected by serious historians. It is a good solid read about an interesting historical period.  My only regret is that Harvey is not a truly great writer.  This epic story desrves its own Prescott, Catton or Tuchman.	2003-11-27

The focus of this book are the decisions made at the highest levels and the impact these decisions have in shaping our world.  This book is a must for anyone who wants a more profound understanding of what is currently going on in the Middle East.<br />This is war as seen from the top.  I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a campaign history. In style and tone, this book reminds me of Barbara Tuchman's classic &quot;The Guns of August&quot;.  A book like this reminds you how a few people making hurried decisions in a time of crisis can shape world history.<br />I can only hope that Michael Oren decides to write a book about the October 1973 War.	2003-11-24

In his book Colonial Conscripts, Myron Echenberg delves into the even more insidious practice of conscirpting a nation's young men for the colonizers' army.<br />The Tirailleur Senegalais fought and died for France during two World Wars and numerous colonial adventures.  Unlike the British and other colonial powers, France did not recruit mercenaries from their African possesions.  Instead they built a complex system of conscription that touched every village and hamlet under French control.  Peasants were drafted into African units of the French Army, given rudimentary training in French culture and military tactics and then sent around the world to fight in French wars.  Thousands of Tirailleurs died in trenches and fox holes of northern France.<br />Unlike the English, France created a fiction that their African subjects were French. In turn,they had the same rights and responsibilites as all other French citizens and this included going to war to defend the French Republic.  This sort of droll cynacism was so beautifully French in its conception and implementation.<br />This book is not a military history of the Tirailleur Senegalais.  Its focus is on the politics and experience of conscription in West Africa.  This book is a detailed chronicle of French imperial cynacism.	2003-10-23

During this period, the Shanghai metropolitan area was sub-divided into the International Settlement, the French Concession and Japanese controlled Shanghai.  In this war time city of overlapping jurisdictions and loyalties, crime flourished as it had never before.<br />Thanks to the release of secret Chinese police files long held by the CIA, Frederick Wakeman is able to chronicle the story of crime in Shanghai.  This story has all the drama of a great crime tale.  The book focuses on the western suburbs of Shanghai known as the &quot;Bandlands&quot;.  This disputed region of the city was the home to gambling casinos, brothels and opium dens.  <br />All the great characters of a Chinese crime tale are present.  There is the Green Gang, Japanese Secret Police, Nationalist Assasins, Puppet Government Assasins, Korean and Japanese Gangsters and helpless Imperialist police forces.  The violent interaction of all these forces is inherently interesting.<br />Although, written for the Chinese History specialist, there is enough of interest in this book for anybody who wants to read a good real life crime tale.  However, I would recommend first reading Wakeman's &quot;Policing Shanghai&quot;.  It places this story in its proper historical context.	2003-10-01

In his second volume, Grant Takes Command, Catton finishes the story with Grant's final victory over Robert E. Lee at Appamatox.  Catton takes nearly a thousand pages to cover Grant's wartime experience.<br />Normally, nearly a thousand pages on one man's experiences over the course of four and a half years would seem excessive.  But in this case, it has been a real pleasure to read these two volumes.  Bruce Catton was one the great history writers of the Twentieth Century and in these two volumes he chronicles the rise of one of the most remarkable persons in American history.  <br />These two volumes remind me why I first fell in love with the study of history.  If you are looking for the exact movements of Burnside's Corp at Cold Harbor or what life was like for the average soldier from Wisconsin, these two volumes are not for you.  But if you like to curl up with a great history book on a rainy afternoon, these volumes are for you.  History as it should be written.	2003-09-07

This is definitely not the book for someone like my father-in-law who believes his time in the Marines were the best years of his life.  Nor is this a book for someone looking for a shoot'm up boy's adventure story.  Jarhead is not a light read. This is a book for serious readers.  Unfortunatley, it is a book that most readers will not have the education nor subtlness of thought to understand.  For many, this story will only be a red flag of encitement.  Just look at the Amazon reviews.<br />I liked the book because Anthony Swafford is painfully honest. He paints a poor picture Marine Corp and he does not spare himself in this portrait.  He is every bit as stupid and base as the people around him.  Like it or not, this is Swafford's take on his time in the Corp.  Its honest and well written and that is all you can ask for.<br />For all those who enjoy another take on the young man coming of age during wartime story, check out Christian Jenning's Mouthful of Rocks, another painfully honest antidote to the greatest generation type of military autobiography.<br />This book is recommended for the serious reader.	2003-08-06

When I purchased his book, I was expecting another book about &quot;The Mexican Condition&quot; or some new take on magic realism.  What a pleasant surprise to discover a suspense novel set in Central Europe!<br />Padilla is not your average suspense or mystery writer.  He is much smarter.  In his ability to combine deep thinking with a simple but elegant style, Padilla reminds me of Borges.  Yet he never leaves the shadow world as imagined by Eric Ambler and Alan Furst.<br />Break the swan's neck! No more flying burros!  A new and very clever voice is emerging from Mexico City.

Three of the most famous were the soldiers Valentine Baker and Charles &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon and the explorer Samuel Baker.  Brian Thompson's Imperial Vanities is a biography which intertwines the lives of these three larger than life characters.<br />Many books have been written about each of these men.  They lived exciting lives crammed with adventure and drama. The three were some of the most colorful characters of the Nineteenth Century. Brian Thompson is a good writer and he does an excellent job of weaving their stories together. However, in the end these three characters lived such rich lives that it is an injustice to try to tell their stories in just 254 pages.<br />This is a good book for anybody who wants a quick sketch.  I would not recommend this book for someone who loves Victorian England and the stories of the men who carved out an Empire.	2003-06-05

To do this, she created six Latina characters who represent diverse Latino experiences.  Her book has two Cubans, two Mexican Americans, a Puerto Rican and a Colombian.  In addition, within this group, there is a Jew, a Lesbian, two Afro-Latinas and a character of mixed race.  As you can see, Valdes-Rodriguez has a lot of bases covered in this \\"representative\\" group of  friends.<br />It is a great idea to create a novel where Latinas must grapple with issues of race, class, politics and sexual orientation. Where Valdes-Rodriguez begins to fail when she starts putting meat onto these characters.  Instead of creating archetypes, she creates \\"Uber-Latinas\\".  One character is a runway model turned television broadcaster courted by a national network, another character has the number one album in the country and another character is the founder of the most successful Latina magazine in the country and worth a cool ten million dollars.  A novel with accomplished Latinas is one thing but Valdes-Rodriguez' characters have little grounding in reality.  This is too bad, because most people like books with characters that they can readily identify with.<br />One assumes that Valdes-Rodriguez wants to write about Latino diversity as a counter point to the stereotyping that exists in the United States.  Yet, she engages in the same type of bald stereotyping.  Almost all of her Anglo characters are buffons and most of the male characters are serious mysognists.  In Valdes-Rodriguez' world there is no complexity.  Everything is brash and simplistic.  Valdes-Rodriguez likes to pound her readers on the head with the obvious.<br />On the bright side, Valdes-Rodriguez is a good writer.  She has the technical skill to pull off an entertaining light novel.  I would recommend this novel to young Latinas who have never seen themselves in contemporary literature.  However, I wouldnot recommend this book to the serious reader.  The educated reader would be much better off with Sandra Cisneros' Caramelo or Oscar Casares' Brownsville.  Unlike the Dirty Girls Social Club, their books have real characters living in a complex world.	2003-05-17

How did the United States Army evolve from a green and untested force into a battle hardend and victorious army?  This is a great premis for a book.<br />It strikes me as though there are several ways to tell this compelling story.  One approach is to concentrate at the command level and tell the story as seen by generals and politicians.  Show the readers the war as it is seen from the top.  Another approach would be to focus on the men who were at the sharp end of the stick.  Tell us their story using their own words.  Yet another approach to this story would be to concentrate on the technology and learning curve needed to transform an army.<br />My problem with this book is that there is no real point of view.  Atkinson weaves a story that meanders back and forth through a number of approaches to telling this story.  He touches on many key subject but does not have the time to really develop them.<br />It is very difficult to write a general history of a campaign, let alone a nation's army.  It is the rare writer who has the depth knowledge and wisdom to write this type of history.  A general history requires the type of wisdom that comes from many years dedicated to the study of a single topic.  (Historians like Shelby Foote, Michael Howard, Dennis Showalter and Douglas Porch come to mind.)<br />While reading the book, it became very clear to me that Arkinson is a gifted journalist but he is not an historian.  His writing style reminded me of the numerous pithy articles that one reads in USA Today or any other mass circulation newspapers.  Well written and enteraining but not that deep or especially insightful.  Atkinson is a good writer but in the end he is not a great writer.  He does not have the gravitas to make this book a classic.  An Army at Dawn is a good popular history but will leave serious military history readers dissapointed.	2003-05-06

It looks as though a long occupation is about to begin and I wanted to learn more about Iraq and its recent history.  I turned to this Osprey Essential History of the Iran Iraq War because I wanted a quick overview of this conflict.<br />The book is 91 pages and is the typical Osprey sized paperback with plenty of pictures and maps.  Without the maps and photos, the book is about 50-60 pages long and it took me about two hours to read.  <br />The War was approximately 8 years long and there were a million or more casualties.  That is a lot of history to cram into this slim volume.  To be able to do this, the author had to take the grand strategic view of the War.  For those looking for nitty gritty of the War, this is not the book for you.  There are no Angus McBride illustrations of T-72's or Iranian uniforms.  This book tells its story from the lofty height of senior leaders and nation states.<br />This book reminds me of one of those intense articles on history, economics and politics that one can find in a great magazine like the Economist.  I own more than a 100 Osprey books and this is the best writing that I have ever come across in one of their books.  Karsh's prose is economical and thought provoking.  <br />Having finished this book, I had to re-evaluate my understanding of both Saddam Hussein and the Ayatollah Khomeini.  They are both much more complex characters than I had understood.  This is an introductory book on the War and it has inspired me to go out and learn more about the conflict.  Highly recommended and very timely.	2003-04-21

The writing is standard Sabatini.  It is crisp and clear and he knows how to tell a good story.<br />What was dissapointing is that the story has not aged well.  It feels like something that was written in the 1920's.  The characters lack any depth or nuance.  Every thing is black and white. The story line is simplistic and predictable. Captain Blood is an Adventure Tale and not really an Adventure Novel.<br />I love the adventure stories of this time period (ie. Buchan, PC Wren or Ouida) but the craft and art of the adventure novel has moved far beyond Sabatinis adventure tales of the 1920's.  If you are looking for good sea stories, stick with Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey and Maturin series or CS Foresters' Hornblower Series. Captain Blood is interesting because it a precursor to much greater novels.	2002-12-12

The authors are amateurs who share a great love for the subject.  Unfortunately, there is large chasm between an enthusiast and a professional author.  Sadly,the writing and analysis was weak.

His book has all of the virtues of a popular history written during that time period.  The story is driven by bigger than life characters forging history in an exotic locale. The book was a fun read enjoyable in the same way as those big 1950's technicolor movies. Great on plot but a little weak on the history.    To the modern reader, the book is very dated.  The Indians are \\"Red Savages\\" and the Mexicans are lazy and shiftless.  Not surprisingly, the Anglo Fur Traders are heroes straight out of a Hollywood central casting.  David Lavender writes with the easy racism that was common in the pre civil rights era.  In the past fifty years, American historians have made great progress in the study of the West.  We now have a much more nuanced understanding of how the West was really settled.      I would recommend this book to those who like the \\"lite\\" version of history.  A fun read with plenty of good guys and bad guys. Something to read between the tomahawk throwing contest and working on the buffalo hide beer can holder.

Shanghai's reputation as a center of vice and corruption was legendary in its own day.  At the beginning of the Twenty First Century, the Shangai of this period still holds its own romantic appeal.<br />Frederic Wakeman's book is a study of the Nationalist Government's attempt to bring order and discipline to a city through a program of national renewal.  Their goal was to one day recapture the city's full sovereignty by showing the West that the Government could effectively govern Shanghai. This book is the story of how this worthy goal was subverted to the political and monetary needs of the Nationalist Government.<br />Although written for an academic audience, Wakeman's story of the Green Gang, secret Comminturn Agents, turncoat Communist Assasins and corrupt police officials has an appeal that goes far beyond the merely academic.  I loved this book because I enjoyed reading about the intricate details of some of the greatest crimes and criminals of this truly golden age of crime.	2002-09-18

People and societies living on the margins are rapidly being drawn into the world economy. As this process speeds on, these same people are taking a step back and wondering what is it that makes us unique?  And in turn, who and what is truly &quot;authentic&quot;.<br />Michelle Bigenho's book looks at these important questions within the context of Bolivian musical performance.  As a participant observer, Bigenho joins and chronicles the experiences of three groups of musicians.<br />The first group is made up of professional musicians/intellectuals whose performance repertoire includes mestizo criollo music from the era of the Chaco War.  This group explores the question of what it means to be a Bolivian by re-discovering music of the traumatic Chaco War. This was the key event that helped develop the sense of Bolivia as a nation state. This group helps expand the idea of what is &quot;authentic&quot;.<br />The second case she describes is of an indigenous community that due to the migration of young people fears that it is losing its traditional culture.  This community lives with the sense that they are losing their &quot;authenticity&quot;.  Bigenho examines this fear through the lense of their musical performances.<br />Bigenho contrasts this feeling of loss with another nearby community that is suffering the same demographic and cultural pressures. However, due to frequent contacts with anthropologists and NGO's, this community is secure in its identity.  Their belief in their own authenticity is reflected in the music.<br />This book is interesting because of its many insights into Bolivian Music and its role in forming and defining a National Identity.  However, what makes this an important book is that it addresses the subtle nuances of &quot;authenticity&quot; in this age of rapid globalization.	2002-08-31

Unlike, many of the other books in this category, her book is not written for linguists or educators.  She touches on the literature of bilingual and multilingualism but she does not overwhelm her readers with the essoteric details and obscure language of academia.  If one wants to go into greater depth, Tokuhama Espinoza provides the links to more serious study.<br />I found her book to be well written and at its heart optomistic. From her personal and observed experience, she understands and is enthused by the linguistic horizons that are open to small children.  This is a good book to help one to begin thinking about these issues.	2002-08-26

His wars covered the face of Europe from Ireland to Italy.  The great commanders of the Age, Marlborough, Vauban, Turenne, Conde, Luxembourg and Eugene all crossed the stage of Louis' many wars.  This is a lot of history to compress into one volume.<br />John Lynn does an admirable job of surveying the different wars and keeping track of all the campaigns that shaped these wars.  He writes clearly and economically.  One finishes the book having a better understanding of Louis' grand strategic vision.<br />This is not a book for someone wanting to learn more about the great commanders of the Age or the details of specific campaigns or battles. This is a book about war, writ large.<br />In my opinion, the value of this book for the general reading public of military history is that it places the accomplishments of Frederick the Great and later Napoleon into a better context.  To understand why they were such revolutionaries, it is important to place them in contrast to an era where war was seen as process and the decisive moment did not exist.	2002-08-21

The one eyed anarchist is at his very best when he is Mexico City.  This is his home and he has wonderful eye for the absurdities of daily life in the world's largest city.  However, problems begin when he leaves the D.F. for the frontera.  Both Belascoaran Shayne and the book meander around both sides of the US-Mexico Border.  The frontera is not Taibo's beat and unfortunately this is evident in the book.  I would recommend this book only to die hard Taibo fans.  For those new to Taibo, check out his earlier books.	2002-08-18

The War of Austrian Succession does not have the cache of the better known Seven Years War or the War of Spanish Succession.  Nevertheless, the War of Austrian Succession/Silesian Wars has a lot to recommend it.  The story of the teenaged Maria Theresa who upon ascending the thrown is greedily attacked by Prussia, Bavaria and France is a great story.  With no credible allies, Maria Theresa was able to rally her people to defend her empire.<br />Reed Browning is good writer and has the organizational ability to help the reader keep track of the myriad of diplomatic and military details.  My only criticism is the pathetic maps that accompany the book.  The poor author must have not found the money to include better maps with his book.  <br />The War of Austrian Succession is an obscure war.  Reed Browning has done a wonderful job of bringing a little known conflict to life.	2002-07-18
US	52661151	RBEJCADKBT5R8	0521311942	948643290	The Bilingual Family	Books	3	33	45	N	Y	Reads like a Masters Thesis	In this world of increased Globalism, where millions of people cross ethnic and linguistic frontiers on a daily basis, one would think that bilingualism would be a well studied subject.  I was dissapointed by Bilingual Family in that it unsucessfully tries to be both scholarly and a \\"how to\\" manual.  For a serious student or scholar of bilingualism this book is a dissapointment in that it is a superficial and somewhate dated survey of the current literature on bilingualism.  Those looking for a \\"how to\\" manual will also be dissapointed by the stilted and dry writing style of the authors.  The best thing about the book is the numerous short case studies of family bilingualism in numerous parts of the world.  In the end, I felt as though I was reading somebody's Masters Thesis.	2002-05-03

During that long year, France experienced the destruction of two armies at Metz and Sedan, the Siege of Paris and the unsucessful attempts to relive the city and finally the bloody Paris Commune. <br />In the years following these disasters the French people tried to put a positive spin on this series of catastrophies. Artists like Detaille and De Nueville painted canvasses of noble soldiers defending the nation.  Writers and historians tried to find positive stories and lessons from the Defeat.<br />Leonce Patry's memoirs were written 25 years after the war.  His goal was to tell his story with as much honesty and frankness as was possible.  His memoirs are a reaction to the false sugar coating that had been taking place during the previous 25 years.  <br />Patry began the war as a young naive lieutenant and finished it as battle hardened captain.  He led troops in the initial battles of the War.  He was trapped during the siege of Metz and was there when Bezaine surrendered.  Patry escaped Prussian imprisonment and fled to northern France where he took up arms again with Faidherbe's Army of the North.  He endured the final battles of the War and then led his troops against the Paris Communards.<br />If one is looking for a general history of the Franco Prussian War, one should immediately go to Michael Howard's classic study of the war.  Patry's well told story is about war as seen by lieutenants and captains. Patry writes well and is very unassuming.<br />Finally, the translator Douglas Fermer has produced a wonderful translation.  His foot notes, Forward, bibliography and <BR>appendices are simply amazing!  This translation was obviously a work of love by a very gifted writer and scholar.  This book is a must buy for every serious student of the Franco Prussian War.	2002-04-22

Following the Afghan War, a small group of Senior Officers gathered together to publish a history of the Soviet War experience in Afghanistan.  They hoped to pass on the hard won lessons of their war onto a new generation of Russian officers who are currently engaged in guerilla wars in the Caucusus and Central Asia.  Unfortunately, there has been little interest in publishing their book in Russia.  In an effort to get their book published they turned to Lt. Col Grau, an American soldier/scholar of the Russian Army.  <br />\\"The Soviet Afghan War\\" is an attempt to distill lessons from a bitter experience.  The Soviet Army that rolled into Afghanistan in 1979 was a formidable force trained to do battle with NATO in Western Europe.  They were unprepared for a guerilla war waged in the high mountains and deserts of Afghanistan.  However, as the war progressed, the Soviets learned and adpopted new tactics. The Army that left Afghanistan was radically transformed.  This learning process is at the core of the book.<br />This is the third book in Lt. Col Grau's trilogy on the Soviet Afghan War.  \\"The Bear Went Over the Mountain\\" is about combat as seen through the eyes of Platoon and Company Leaders.  \\"The Other Side of the Mountain\\" is war and all its tactical permutations as seen by the Muhajadeen.  \\"The Soviet Afghan War\\" is the big picture as seen by colonels and generals.  Of the three books, \\"The Soviet Afghan War\\" is the most intellectually satisfying.	2002-01-26

The Impressionists are the most famous French Art Movement of the late 19th Century.  At about the same time, France was also producing a great school of historical painters and illustrators.  Edouard Detaille in my opinion was the greatest historical painter/illustrator of the 19th Century.  Do not buy L'Armee Francaise for the text.  It is an English translation of stilted and heavily baroque 19th Century French.  However, the illustrations are simply amazing!  This is one of my favorite books.	2001-12-15

The author of this book was a self admitted petty thief and criminal when he entered the legion.  This book chronicles his  story from his drunken days in England to his entrance into the elite paratroop regiment unit to his desertion. Although, I have never served in the Legion, my sense is that his book is very honest.  Jenning's book is a wonderful contrast to Simon Murray's &quot;Legionaire&quot;.	2001-12-15

In his book, &quot;The Bear Went Over the Mountain&quot;, Lester Grau carefully examines some of those small cuts. The book consists of a number of short vignettes written principally by Soviet Platoon and Company Leaders.  In these short narratives, these leaders describe their combat experiences in such realms as ambush, convoy escort and urban fighting.  At the end of the story, there is the Frunze Military Academy analysis of the narrative in which the strengths and weaknesses of the action are analyized.  The vignettes end with Lt. Col. Grau's analysis of the action.<br />This book is not for someone looking for a general military history of the Soviet experience in Afghanistan.  It is a book about small unit tactics and about what works and what fails.  I only hope that this valuable book and his other book, &quot;The Other Side of the Mountain&quot; is being ready by young American Platoon and Company leaders currently fighting in Afghanistan.<br />I obtained both books through Amazon.com UK.	2001-12-03
