A few techniques presented are effective, but several are from the &quot;old school&quot; of hand to hand.<br />Good descriptions of the techinques but no discussions on theory, but that wasn't to be expected.<br />Pick up the book - it is a good addition to a hand to hand combat instructors library.	2002-10-13

A set of novels that are based upon the card game with the same title. The novels are recreating the history and story line of the card game. As someone who does not play the  card game - I find the stories fascinating and interesting. So the stories should be  insightful to anyone who enjoys playing the game.<br />The second book picks up where The Scorpion (Book 1) left off.  It is a few  years after the the coup and things are not settling back down, in fact life for the people in the novel is increasingly getting more dangerous as undead warriors  return to sack towns and destroy everything in their path.<br />The novel brings back many of the players from the first novel and introduces a few more who will become players in the upcoming novels. <br />The book is worth a read if you enjoy a good fantasy book, especially if you enjoy a good Samurai-esque adventure.  This is no Shogun - but it is fun, none the less.	2000-10-29

As a fan of Shogun, King Rat and the other Clavel Novels - I was excited  to learn that a fantasy novel had been written using the Asian Culture.   When I picked up the book, I knew zero about the card game \\"Lord of the  Five Rings\\" which the book is based upon.<br />The story provides the readers  with a great historical background for the card game. I learned this after  I read the book and began to speak with the people at my local hobby  store.<br />The story is fast paste and provides surprises at every corner.   Written in a great style the one annoying thing for some people may be the  use \\"Japanese\\" words in the middle of a sentence - with no glossary  provided.  Granted many people know the words that were used - but there  are those out there who would like a glossary to provide a definition.<br />I  loved this book and loved the story line - I cannot wait until the other  two books in this series are completed.	2000-08-15

This general textbook is written in a well-organized manner. It presents the common topics associated with criminal investigations: documentation, report writing, suspect identification and methods used for crime scene  surveys. The author makes use of recent court decisions during the  presentation of his topics.    The chapters are logically placed so that it  is easy to see how an investigation would take place. There are several  illustrations and drawings, which help the reader identify the topic being  discussed.  This edition is written in easy to read and comprehend  sections.  Technical words are explained in detail.<br />The basics of  criminal investigation are covered within the textbook - advanced topics  such as criminal interrogation and procedures are briefly discussed but  they are not the main focus of this book.  This textbook provides an  excellent foundation for the criminal justice student who is planning a  career in law enforcement.	2000-07-11

Now that I'm older I understand what he meant.  The  battlefield lessons provided by Sun Tzu - can be used in today's business  empires.<br />Many have called `The Art of War' a Chinese version of  Machievalli's `The Prince.\\"  Both books provide a  warrior/prince/manager/CEO with a way to think about problems and come up  with dynamic solutions.  This translation provides the work of Sun Tzu in a  good translation, not great, but only good.<br />Another positive aspect of  this book is that it doesn't define what each passage means.  It lets the  reader determine the meaning and personally apply it to their life and  situation.<br />Give it a read, Sun Tzu does not disappoint and decide for  yourself - what Sun Tzu wanted the reader to understand - don't be forced,  as some books do, to allow them to tell you what Sun Tzu meant.	2000-07-10

Reading this book makes one realize how we are part of the circle of life.  Our bodies are part of a cycle and this book graphically describes the  process of decomposition.  This book provides details on how a forensic  entomologist can document the time of death, based upon several factors on  the scene, to include the decomposition of the body, bugs that are nearby  and other environmental factors.<br />This book is well written and the  illustrations are superb.  I recommend this book to any investigator,  detective or mystery/crime writers.	2000-07-10

This is an excellent resource for the person who is new to the StarOffice Suite. This book provides excellent writing and illustrations to demonstrate the basic principles of using StarOffice 5.1  <br />The book  covers all of the basic techniques of using: StarWriter (Word Processing),  StarCalc (Spreadsheet), StarBase (Database), StarImpress (Presentation),  StarDraw (Graphic Design), StarMail &amp; StarDiscussion  (Mail and News  Reader), and the StarSchedule (Scheduler). <br />StarOffice 5.1 software runs  native on the all-major operating systems and this book's topics cover  ideas that can be applied across the operating system board. What works on  StarOffice for Linux will probably work for StarOffice for Windows - there  is very little difference between the specific OS versions. You need not  buy a separate book for each OS you run. <br />This may not be the best  StarOffice book out there - but it is perfect for the new user and is  probably the best new user guide. Unlike other new user guides - the  material is not written for `Idiots' or `Dummies.' It is written by  professionals for professionals and doesn't have jokes on every other page,  but what it does have that other books do not are colorful tutorials -  which almost guarantee the user success.<br />I recently loaded up StarOffice  5.2 and this book will still be useful for anyone who uses this for the  upgraded version. It probably won't be necessary to buy a new book with the  new version.  <br />For advance users of StarOffice or similar Office Suites,  or the user who needs more then a basic knowledge of StarOffice - this book  will provide very little for you. There are several other books out there  that cover StarOffice, macros and \\"tweaking\\" in greater detail.	2000-07-10

From my teenage years to my early 30's - I have found the stretches in this book to be a worthwhile endeavor. The author  provides several stretching routines for a wide variety of activities.  Secondly, there are drawings, which demonstrate the correct way to do these  stretches. Stretching is an important part of any exercise regime and this  book helps out by providing a necessary guide to stretching. The author  points out the dangers of overstretching and gives the reader good advice  for their regimes.	2000-07-03

The authors carefully blend National and  International Organized Crime (OC)Groups, Theories of OC and methods for  controling the spread and growth of the groups.<br />The book is written in a  textbook fashion and the authors provide keywords at the end of each  chapter to assit the student in learning the main points of each  chapter.<br />Both the authors appear very knowledgable in this subject and  they continue to add current information into their newer additions.	2000-07-01

A powerful, moving and well-written book. Away from all the moral problems with capital punishment, the Authors are able to focus on legal issues and statistics to show the problems of executing inmates.  Many of the research  for this book come from The Innocence Project and from the Federal  Government, in the form of published reports from the Bureau of Justice  Statistics.<br />In brief, this book provides a few stories and they explain  how people in this country are wrongly convicted and how scientific  evidence, specifically DNA Testing, can help prove their innocence.<br />The  book also looks at other sources of problems within the judicial system -  Prosecutorial/police misconduct, lazy defense counsels and death-biased  juries.<br />This book provides the reader with an educated discussion on the  problems of the death penalty. I highly recommend it to everyone and  challenge the proponents of the death penalty to read this and look into  their own souls to determine if this is a system we want to continue.	2000-06-28

Red Dragon re-release is a testament to this.  Red Dragon is by far Harris' best book.<br />Will Graham an Ex-FBI Special Agent returns to  help the FBI to catch a serial killer. Even thought this sounds generic -  Graham must battle the demons that he has come to carry with him as he  pursues the killer. Graham's distinction and the reason he left the FBI was  because of Hannibal Lecter.  Graham was the agent who solved/stumbled onto  him and was injured in the process of the capture.  In an act of cleansing  his soul - he must meet with Hannibal to solve his current case.<br />One of  the most provoking things about this book is that we enter into the psyche  of the killer and we listen as he thinks and speaks to himself.  I found  myself feeling sorry for this killer as I continued to read - but his  actions are to barbaric and gruesome to forgive.  We are introduced to  Hannibal Lecter in this book.  It is hard to not hear Sir Anthony Hopkins's  voice as Hannibal when you read his passages in the story. Hannibal has a  small role in the actual book - but plays a major part through-out the  story line.  Hannibal is still as evil as ever.<br />The movie Manhunter is  based upon this book and the movie does a good job at adapting it to the  big screen.	2000-06-28

Either way Michael Crichton tells a great story. His choice of writing style makes the story more believable.  Crichton stays true to his style of fast paced action and it is difficult  to place this book down, once it is opened. Crichton uses explicit  descriptions of orgies, sacrifices and battles wounds through-out the book.  These descriptions are a necessary part of the book, for it gives the  reader the full picture of the lifestyle of the Vikings.<br />I read this  book, prior to viewing the movie _The 13th Warrior_ and I re-read it  afterwards. As the old cliché line goes: \\"I prefer the book to the movie.\\"   The book focuses on the daily life and routines of the Vikings, through the  eyes of an outsider who considers their actions \\"truly barbaric.\\"<br />This  outsider is a representative from Baghdad on a mission from his king. On  his mission he meets the \\"barbarians\\" and becomes entangled in a mission to  stop the evil that comes to destroy villages and the people of the North.	2000-06-27

Normally I don't agree with many of her selections - but in this case I do.  Kingsolver has created rich, believable characters.  Each character  has her turn at describing the events that she witnesses.  What I found  interesting is the recurring events, being told through different  characters and how they, in turn view and process what they  witness/encounter.<br />Without giving too much away - I can say that the book  is laced with excellent uses of symbolism. The witting is easily understood  and at times, you can hear the distinctive voices of each of these ladies  as you begin to read their story.<br />There is a message contained within the  story and it is not difficult to pick up on it - and if you think about it  after you read the book - you will find yourself referring this book to  other people.	2000-06-27

The book is written in  a manner that appeals to both the computer expert and the newbie  user.<br />Each section of the book discusses the basic techniques that are  used on a regular basis and then it progresses to more powerful techniques.   Examples and illustrations are plentiful - which many people find  helpful.<br />The index and table of contents is written is plain english - so  it is not difficult to find the answer to any question you may have. The  book also discusses the compatibility of StarOffice and other major office  suites.<br />For expert level user tasks - macro designing, the book offers  very little information on this area. But to find the answers on building  the macros - I simply went to the Sun Microsystem's (The Makers of  StarOffice) website and did some poking around until I found my  answer.<br />Sadly, StarOffice 5.2 will debut this year and this book may be  obsolete by teh time you read it - but if you plan to use or continue to  use StarOffice 5.1 - then consider buying this book. <br />The price may be a  bit higher then some of the &quot;thinner&quot; books - but in this case -  you get what you pay for. Don't be a &quot;Dummy.&quot;  Purchase this  book!	2000-06-21

His main focus in his book is on the soldier. Grossman also discusses the ideas of flight and flight - and  expands upon our current beliefs of that phenomenon.<br />What is the most  shocking about this book is that we as a society are training our  youngsters to become programmed killers. Our video games and violent movies  teach kids to be numb to the violence and emotions that arise from  killing.<br />Grossman does an excellent job in breaking down the levels of  killing and discussing the post-stress that an individual will/could  experience.<br />I recommend this book to any law enforcement  officer/soldier/social workers and othes who deal with crisis situations.	2000-06-21

His use of stories to alarm and alert the reader are done in such away that it covers up the major problem that we are truely facing. Mr. Meeks  un-intentionally creates a smokescreen - which blurrs the reader from  trying to figure out how to solve the real problem- racism and  prejudice.<br />The State of Missouri recently passed racial profiling  legislation - requiring police officers to take down the CARD (Class, Age,  Race, Dress) information of every person that is stopped. But the question  that remains - and what this book does not answer or approach is what do we  do with these numbers?  These numbers will not tell us anything we  know.<br />Even though Mr. Meeks suggest Civil Remedies to combat the problem  - this is a solution - but many of the people who are victims of DWB are  indigent and do not have the resources to challenge a police department.  <br />Mr. Meeks provides the reader with a great way to deal with people when  faced with DWB - his nonconfrontational approach provides us with a  positive way to deal with the police and it can be used to other people we  deal with on a regular basis.<br />My final comment on this book, is that it  appeared to focus on Whites vs Colors - but we all have our prejudices. We  all judge people by CARD standards. <br />Mr. Meeks book made a worthwhile  effort on combatting the problem of DWB - but I think this issue is a small  part of a larger problem.	2000-06-21

Prior to a recent vacation, I pulled the book off the shelf and packed it into my duffle bag. I began to re-read this book and found myself re-immersed in  the epic tale by Barker.<br />Barker begins the book, with little reference to  what the reader will expect in the final part of the book. The characters  have rich backgrounds and their personalities are vivid.  As the story  progresses, you see the characters evolve and battle the demons that have  haunted them.<br />Without giving too much away - Barker is able to create not  only parallel universes - but he creates a new religion with a rich and  full history. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who can immerse  himself or herself into a good book and suspend reality for a few moments.  This book is not for religious zealots, who would find much of Barker's  topics and style heresy.<br />This is clearly one of Barker's best books. A  great short story author who can also write great epic adventures.	2000-06-07
