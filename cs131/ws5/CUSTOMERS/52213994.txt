Lewis: 365 Daily Readings from His Classic Works	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Good selection	I own every book (except one) that was ever written by Lewis, frequently in first editions or full leather bindings, and have read each one several times.  I also have several books written by Walter Hooper who put Lewis as the author of his books.    This collection is very good at representing the razor sharp reasoning skills of Lewis and his way of explaining things clearly to the general public.

It is pastoral (every day life choice advice) in nature and not doctrinal.  People who are not Lutherans will not be offended by anything in the book. <br /> <br />The other devotionals are touchy-feely in nature and indistinguishable from most Eastern, such as Hindu and Buddhist, religious teachings.	2005-09-17

Frequently the person who heard of the other discoverers before they ever thought about the idea.    There is one defect in the book and that is the author's bias against spiritual-religious beliefs.  He is ignorant of the basics of these systems and makes false claims about them and then condemns the people who hold them and claim that it was these beliefs that caused them to get the credit for what others did.      Another bias of the author is that he thinks that the first person who made a poorly functioning invention should get the credit instead of the person who made a fully functioning version that the public accepted and used..      A famous philosopher said that history is the lie that historians agree to.  This is very true.  After reading this book you will wonder how much of what journalists say is true considering historians who do careful research for several years on a topic frequently get it wrong.	2005-09-07

Once this book was published, people came forward with the titles of all of the old classics that state the same views as in the book.

Be aware that that colored the book with favorable views of these people's talent level and Soviet Intelligence in general. The book does contain valuable information along with important omission and advertising style hot air.  I would suggest that you consider Venona by John Earl Haynes or The Venona Secrets: Exposing Soviet Espionage and America's Traitors by Herbert Romerstein.  The former is an academic description of the 450+ Soviet agents disclosed by the US breaking Soviet codes used during the war. The latter is an inside story by two US espionage agents and experts.  One of the gems it reveals is that President FDR was gullible and had several advisors who were Soviet agents.  Stalin was afraid of a two front war in Europe and with Japan in the Pacific.  He composed an insulting message for his agents to present to FDR who sent as is it to the Japanese government.  This provoked the war in the Pacific.

The authors had access to the decrypt of Soviet messages from the 1941-1945 period as well as the Soviet espionage archives and the FBI archives.  They explain in detail how they obtained their information and then described the activities of Soviet agents.  At the end is a list of about 450 people who were Soviet agents.  For those of you who are not interested in the historic details, the bottom line is that everyone who was publicly accused of being a Soviet agent was one.  Senator McCarthy was right and the professors and journalists were wrong.<br /><br />I also recommend The Venona Secrets : Exposing America's Cold War Traitors by Herb Romerstein if you want more detailed information from an experienced espionage agent of the time.

How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less	Books	3	76	109	N	Y	verbosity	This book, which contains good material, could be easily condensed from the current 200 pages down to 75 pages.  Just read the section heading titles and the first sentence in the listed items and only read in further detail on concepts that are new to you.    The dating site is not as good as it is described.  There are a variety of problems some which you have workarounds for and some which cannot be overcome.  The workaround problems are that the site will not function with some web browsers.  The abbreviated personality test is not 100% accurate.  The test does not test for honesty, realistic expectations, or mental health.  These last three problem areas are very prevalent on the site, possibly more so than on other sites.  The problem that you cannot work around is that they will only show you the matches they think are close to you.  If you are young and live in a large metropolitan area this is no problem.  If you are not you will not get any or very few matches. It would be better if they relaxed the match criteria and rated the match and let the two people decide if they wanted to risk it.  Another problem is that the time of the last visit of the matches is not indicated.  You will get your hopes up over matches that have expired memberships or are people who have not joined yet.  .    A further amusing thing about the site is that the book lists eating addictions as one reasons for marriages ending in divorce and advise against marrying anyone who has it.  The site does not require people to list their weight.    After being on five dating sites for one year each, the sad truth is that dismal as eharmony is, it is much better than any of the others.  Only 98% of the people there are strange as opposed to 99.9% on the other popular sites. This means that you need to get 50 matches to find one you like and there is only a 2% chance that they will like you.  In other words you will need to get 2500 matches to have a 50% probability of mutual interest with someone in a good state of mental health and having realistic expectations.  There is one sort of dishonesty on the site.  They will show you people who are new and do not tell you that they have not paid for membership.  So do not pay to join the site unless you see someone you really like or you are contacted by someone you like.    Also keep in mind that a recent survey of people with internet access and with recent happy marriages showed that only 3% of them met through any dating site.  I think that you will find almost 100% of the peoplel on all dating sites, including this one, are at the bottom of the desirability scale.  The data is out.  The annual marrage rate for this site is 0.5%.  This means you have to subscribe for 100+ years to have a 50% chance of getting married.  They hide the statistics on the divorce rate for the site.	2004-08-24

It explains which personality types go well together.  This should prove useful to people in selecting a spouse or business partner.  The next 55% of the book describes eight types of toxic behavior.  It gives detailed information about each type so that you can examine yourself for having these types of behavior.  It also gives advice on how to not reinforce the toxic behavior of others.  The remaining 10% of the book is a tutorial on how to change your own behavior.

Infralapsarian and supralapsarian forms of the doctrine of predestination can become identifiers of alternative orthodoxies. This book is written in the compact scholarly journal style.  Unless you are Ph.D. level theologian or philosopher you will not be able to follow the arguments, much less understand the technical terms.  I have no trouble reading any other theology book so far and that includes Knox written in the spelling and speech of Scotland in 1550.  This book is rough going for me.

The author only goes back 35 years in history to show data.  He should have gone back 150 years so that two major depressions could be used for historic data.  The data he presents is flawed.  He shows that in some markets houses cost 6 years income of an average individual.  Since only half of the population owns houses and frequently have two workers, he should have done the ratio calculation for the family income of the people who own houses.  We have gone through the worst stock market crash and state of unemployment in 70 years.  Why did not the housing prices decline during that period?  He shows the high level of personal debt.  He then postulates what will result.  Why did he not show historic situations that were similar and what resulted?    This book reminds me of one written 27 years ago by a person with similar economic credentials.  That book claimed that housing prices would decline for several decades after 1980.  Have they?    Another problem is the interjections of social engineering comments that are way off base.      The author does not consider the effects on prices of the rising population and immigration of wealthy foreigners.      The only thing I believe from the book is that when interest rates rise the housing prices will temporarily drop slightly.    The following has been added to the review two years later:    I now believe that the market will eventually drop drastically in some areas where prices have doubled since the book was published.  They will come down to be in line with the prices that existed when the book was published.  I still believe that the overall market will still be higher and not lower compared to when the book was published and my statements in the original review still hold.	2003-06-07

The book is written at the 8th grade reading and intellectual level, which accounts for its popularity.  The book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient Greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading.  An analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world.  There is a total lack of academic rigor.  The author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself.  What is worse is the absent material.  The author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that Socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent.  Another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented.  Watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion.	2003-04-21

As a result it is somewhat biased. For instance we are not told in the article about Angelton that he was kicked out for being a failure at his job. During the last 10 years of his career, every Soviet defector that he claimed was genuine was a Soviet plant. Every one he claimed was a plant was genuine. After he was fired his safe was cut open and found to contain many year old evidence that he did not act on but when followed up was used to catch several Soviet spies. <BR>The article on Agee, who was a despicable person, falsely claims that he was the one who first revealed the identity of the Athens CIA head of station. Several heads of station had lived in the same house. Every taxi driver knew the identity. The house was the worst possible choice for a CIA person to live in. It was at the end of a dead end street and was so secluded that any illegal activities such as kidnapping or murder would go un-witnessed by others.<br />The author gives misleading information to the effect that once the contents of a classified photo appear in some other public photo the classified photo should be declassified.

This is a good first book on the subject and will get you oriented so that reading more detailed books will be easier.  There are errors that are easily spotted, such as a passive mixer with more output signal power than input power.

This book should be useful for sorting fact from journalistic fiction. Apart form an occasional soapbox sermon on sidelines, such as AIDS, the writing style is more of the school history textbook and sticks to Diana. The facts are presented without any judgmental observations.  There are occasional logical fallacies, such as inferring that disapproval is caused only by terror.<br />There are enough facts to deduce that Diana was the cause of over half of her problems, including her easily avoidable death from not wearing a seat belt.  Charles seems to have the autocratic George III as his role model and believed that his private treatment of his wife should be no different from his public treatment of commoners.<br />The last chapter contrasts the basic philosophy difference between Scotland Yard's avoiding dangerous situations and the Arab philosophy of letting dangerous situations occur and surviving them.

The program is intended to be very simple so that students can learn how to use it in a short time.  It is for designing MOS digital integrated circuits.  Students with the basic knowledge gained from using this simplified program will find the next step of learning the more complex programs used in industry a less painful experience.	2002-08-25

It does this by not using the classical infinite series derived in calculus class.  It uses approximations derived by the author or from the public domain.  Even though I detest computer programming and rarely do it, I found the mathematical aspects of this book good entertainment and mind expanding.  It was also refreshing to find a mathematical person who could explain things clearly.  My past experience with mathematicians is that they would have trouble teaching a duck how to swim.	2002-08-25

In spite of my limited programming experience, I was able to follow the lessons in this book.  The information is presented in a logical sequence and fully explained and illustrated.  As the title suggests, this book is for engineers who need answers for their own use and is not intended to show you how to make fancy illustrations for presentations.<BR>There are two shortcomings that bothered me.  One is the lack of a table at the end of each chapter listing the other commands and functions that do almost the same thing as the ones covered in the chapter.  This would increase this book's usefulness as a reference.  The other problem is the end of each chapter having an illustration of some interesting engineering project or concept.  One claimed that Matlab could be used to drastically improve the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles.  The other was a half baked political statement to the effect that you would be better off giving irrevocable control of your life over to a group of people who have a history of looking after their own interests first and others second.  Of course this suggestion was worded in an appealing style.	2002-08-23

Holiness is a neglected concept today and this book will make you think.  The second feature is the 12th grade reading level.  You will not have your intelligence insulted by this book.  It is intended for the general public and not theologians.  Therefore, there are no obscure technical terms.  There are numerous illustrations from history.	2002-08-19

Examples include the fountain of youth, the earth centered universe, the medical practice of bloodletting, and synchronous motors not being able to work.  Instead, it is a description of views held by obscure individuals with no scientific or medical training.<br />The introduction says that the author wanted to write a pamphlet but the publisher wanted him to write a book. This explains the boring repetition of two basic themes. The first is that a restricted set of data will cause a person to make theories that are different than if they had access to more data. The second is the need to believe causes people to select the evidence to support their beliefs and ignore the evidence against them.<br /> The main attraction of the book is the author having every defect he condemns in others throughout the book. He frequently uses the word \\"crackpot\\" and claims that anyone who believes the expanding universe astronomy theory or the abandonment of the gold standard economic theory is a crackpot. The first of these theories is today believed to be true and the second has been adopted by all nations of the world.<br />The author uses selected data in places and ignores data in others to prove his point. He has a psychopathic hatred of spiritual/religious beliefs. He takes advantage of every opportunity to blame the person's defective scientific ideas on his spiritual beliefs even if the reader can find no connection. Then he infers that this proves the spiritual beliefs false and then implies that anyone holding the spiritual beliefs is a crackpot.	2002-08-11

This book has all of the usual defects of books from Kluwer Academic Publishers.  Acronyms in the text and terms in equations are not defined.  Diagrams have errors.  It seems to be a cut and paste job with very little systematic development of the subject.  Graphs of CAD program outputs are presented with no or very little comment or discussion.  There is one case of a technical error.  A mathematical program output which claims to show the effects of amplifier noise figure really illustrates the beneficial effects of dithering data to overcome the effects of finite word length in FFT calculations.	2002-08-10

It also gives supplementary information on other moles and incompetents in the CIA as it goes along.  There is one problem in the book.  It assumes that the CIA has a monopoly on people with common human nature imperfections.  I have seen similar problems in the military, academia, and industry.  The reader is probably familiar with the recent Catholic child molesting scandal which is another example.  As a result of this, the author advocates corrective action which involves the either-or logical fallacy and \\"throwing out the infant with th bath water\\" type actions.	2002-07-06

The material is highly compressed and assumes that the reader is among the 1000 most skilled people in the world in this area and is totally knowledgable in the state of the art of six months ago and earlier.  It therefore leaves out things that a new learner in the area would need to know.  This explains why there are so many copies available used and their low prices and their fine/unused condition.	2002-07-01

It contains correct information on a limited number of projects mostly very old in time and technology.  Even then portions of these projects are not discussed.  It also details the shortcomings of people in the military and White House without describing the shortcomings of many CIA project leaders and managers.  I personally know of one person praised in numerous chapters who later went into industry.  He was the head of a high technology company.  By the time that higher authority in the company became aware of his poor performance and booted him out, enough damage had been done that the company never recovered.  It declined in technology level and size until it got absorbed by another company.	2002-06-28

The author seems to not have any background in technology, espionage, or military service....  Another fundamental problem is that the collected information is incomplete and of varying importance and truthfulness.  The reader and author do not have any clue if additional information would completely change the readers' concept of what happened.  This is sort of like the seven blind men who examined the elephant. Only we have the report of just one of them.  The third fundamental limitation is the human information sources.  The author and reader have no way to determine if they are intentional pranksters, under delusions of their imagined past accomplishments, or people who heard, and possibly misunderstood, flawed rumors and passes them on as the absolute truth. Most of the technical information is totally wrong.  For instance it is reported that short wave receiving stations in Cuba can intercept point-to-point microwave links 1000 miles away.  Another is that chemicals released in outer space over the ocean drifted in the air over a town.  The author seems to think that the Umbra security compartment covers all collection methods, targets, and time periods.  Compartments are very finely divided....  Activities are either praiseworthy or despicable depending upon which nation does them.  The author also attributes activities of agencies that were ordered by presidents Kennedy and Johnson to the autonomous volition of the leaders of those agencies....  He claims that an Israeli Army officer ordered the attack on the US spy ship during the Arab-Israeli war.  It is highly unlikely that a middle level Army officer would have knowledge of foreign naval vessels, their positions and activities. It is highly unlikely that this middle level officer would have the authority to order an air force attack on the ship.  It was reported in military trade journals of the time that Israel had warned the US that there was a spy in NSA who was sending the information collected by this ship to the Soviets.  This warning was ignored.  About ten years later, the spy was publicly prosecuted.  It is more likely that the ship was given notice to leave and then attacked when it did not leave.  This was done to prevent the Soviets from gaining information about Israel.	2001-06-10

It is as if a person who was highly skilled in writing liberal arts prose  finds a file cabinet abandoned by a retired engineering manager.  The file  cabinet is filled with a lifetime eclectic collection of magazine articles,  photo copies of sections of books, and reports from subordinates, all of  which were never read by the manager because of time restraints.  The  liberal arts person shuffles the contents together into a book without  really understanding what is written.   This book is strewn with tables and  illustrations which are never referenced in the text.  Most of the  illustrations are multiple generation photocopies.  Equations contain  undefined terms.  Critical design issues are passed over with one sentence  while there is a several page mathematical derivation of the DC output  impedance of a BJT.   The author infers that it is not necessary to  understand what you do as long as you can get the answer from a CAD  program.   The book perpetuates the urban legend that Gilbert invented a  mixer.  This topology goes back to at least 1920 and had been implemented  with relays, vacuum tubes, specialized vacuum tubes, and  discrete  transistors.  The author references Gilbert's paper which references the  discrete transistor version as prior art and then shows how to make a  pre-distortion circuit to add to this mixer to obtain a four quadrant  linear multiplier.  So much for not reading your references. Finally, the  book does not explain anything very clearly.  people who are not already  skilled in RF will not gain any design ability from this book.  They will  however get a false sense of skill level that will allow them to do basic,  simple designs, but not designs that push technology. That is, they could  do a day late dollar short design of consumer products, but not military  products.    This comment was added in 2007.  It seems that Artech House and the IEEE press have become more careful in what they publish.  Most of the books published recently by them are edifying to read and I have purchased and enjoyed several of them.	2000-08-20

Lord Acton said that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  St. Paul said that the love of money is the root of all evil. These two principles have combined in the C. S. Lewis literary estate. As  one of the many economically foolish things CSL did in his life,  he left  the management of his literary estate to two friends who did not have the  experience or time to manage it.  At the first opportunity his friends  unloaded the management upon the first person handy, a student from America  who was keenly interested in Lewis' books and occasionally visited him in  the last summer of his life.<br />Predictable results occurred.  This person  wielded power over publishers who made huge profits from the books.  He had  the power to say which academics had access to certain Lewis archives and  which got permission to quote Lewis.  The publishers had to include this  person's book introductions in which he rewrote himself in a favorable  light into history.  Ambitious specialists needed to agree with the claims.   One such claim was that this person was Lewis' live in, full time, private  secretary for several years.  This person also &quot;discovered&quot; many  unknown Lewis literary works and revisions of existing works that were  significantly lower in literary quality than the original, known Lewis  literature and in some cases contained religious and ethical themes that  were the exact opposite of Lewis' adamantly held views.<br />In this book  Kathryn Lindskoog does a thorough job of investigative journalism in  deflating much of the rewritten history and &quot;new&quot; Lewis works  with documentary evidence and eye witness accounts.  This book reads much  like a Chapman Pincher espionage expose.  This book attracted much  attention, and further eye witness accounts and leads to more documentary  evidence and was followed by a second book, &quot;Light in the Shadow  Lands,&quot; five years later.	1999-01-08
