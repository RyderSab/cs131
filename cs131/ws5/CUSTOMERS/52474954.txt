This tremendous excitement was spurred in part by the development of efficient interior point methods (IPMs) for the solution of SDPs, and important applications of the SDP especially in combinatorial optimization. I believe Etienne De Klerk gives an excellent introduction to these two topics, in this short, but concise monograph published by Kluwer Academic Publishers.<br />Topics covered include theory (duality, degeneracy, complementarity, properties of central path), algorithms (primal and primal dual affine scaling, path following, potential reduction algorithms), and finally applications (approximating the stable set and coloring number of a graph, the satisfiability problem, and quadratic programming).<br />Most of the material presented is based on the personal research of the author with other colloborators, and reflect his personal taste, and various insights on the subject. The monograph is probably the first textbook exclusively devoted to the SDP, and can be used in a graduate course on the subject. Personally, I enjoyed it immensely!.	2003-11-06

This book is part of Springer's series on Comprehensive studies in Mathematics.<br />Volume I deals with convex analysis (convex sets, convex functions, sublinearity and support functions, subdifferentials of convex functions and minimization algorithms for smooth convex functions) and the companion volume II deals more with nonsmooth optimization and bundle algorithms to solve such problems. The theory is developed rigorously with many intriguing examples and figures to illustrate important concepts. As the authors mention in their introduction the minimisation algorithm suggested by Einstein &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;. The two volumes are fairly comprehensive (and as a disclaimer the contents are by no means elementary, and will require a sustained effort on the part of the reader).<br />One can then take on the likes of Rockafellar and Wets' &quot;Variational Analysis&quot; and Borwein and Lewis' &quot;Convex Analysis and Nonlinear optimization, two other recent works in convex analysis and optimization.	2001-06-12

Especially recommended are the chapters on matching, NP Completeness and Approximation  Algorithms.<br />As another reader has remarked, this book is quite old though  (published first in 1982). For a more to date book on Combinatorial  Optimisation, one might want to look at Cook, Cunningham, Pulleyblank and  Schrijver's book on Combinatorial Optimisation (published in 1998).	1999-11-30

Part I develops<BR>the duality theory for linear optimization, by considering<BR>a considerably simpler self-dual &quot;skew symmetric problem&quot;.<BR>This is certainly a novel introduction to interior point methods,<BR>not found in the literature. Part II is based on the usual<BR>logarithmic barrier approach,  more in tune with what is known<BR>in the literature, and part III deals with a broader class<BR>of IPM's, some of which not based on &quot;follow the central<BR>path&quot; paradigm. Jim Renegar's famous short step algorithm finds<BR>its place here. Part IV is entitled &quot;Miscellaneous Topics&quot;,<BR>and contains a short chapter on Karmakar's famous projective<BR>algorithm.<br />My only complaint with the book is that since each of the four<BR>parts attempt to be self contained, despite having considerable<BR>overlap, the authors end up repeating the same thing a number<BR>of times, at times annoying!. Anyway, this book is written<BR>by three of the foremost experts in the field of interior point<BR>methods, and if there is one person from whom I would want to<BR>learn IPM's it is Prof. Tamas Terlaky. As the reviewer below<BR>has remarked check out his article on &quot;An easy way to teach<BR>interior point methods&quot; too. To summarize, a extremely<BR>well written book (the authors have put a lot of thought<BR>into this!) and strongly recommended!.<br />For other books on interior point methods one might want<BR>to check out Wright's &quot;Primal Dual Interior Point Methods&quot;,<BR>Ye's &quot;Interior Point Algorithms&quot;, and finally Bob<BR>Vanderbei's book (the latter offers only a simple<BR>introduction!).	1999-09-06
