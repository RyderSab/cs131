Anyone looking to dip their toes in Aeneas' story, either as a prelude to reading the Aeneid itself or merely to acquaint themselves with this major chapter of Greco-Roman mythology, would do well to spend a few hours with Rose Williams' brief, breezy retelling of the Aeneas legend. (Note that Williams' book is not precisely an abbreviated version of the Aeneid: she begins Aeneas's story in childhood while Vergil picks up the tale in the seventh year after the fall of Troy.)<br /><br />Williams' tone throughout the book is light. In her discussion of the Trojan prince Paris, for example, who had been exposed as a baby but lived to tell about it, the author writes: \\"Anyone who has read much classical mythology knows that any babe abandoned on a mountainside was always rescued by a wandering shepherd and taken home to some unfortunate shepherd's wife. Thereafter the child was reared in flowery meadows tending sheep until a little bird told him one day about his royal heritage. Whereupon he descended on his true father's palace, or what he thought was his true father's palace, usually with disastrous results.\\" In Paris' case those disastrous results would include the siege and destruction of Troy, which he brought about single-handedly by stealing Helen from her jealous Greek husband--her face launching a thousand ships and all that. Williams' writing is punctuated by cute asides which almost become cloying: \\"Pallas' war horse, Aethon, according to Vergil, was led in the procession with big tears rolling down his hairy cheeks. (The intelligentsia always scoffs at such statements, saying that horses do not cry in grief, or at all, for that matter. Maybe they just never encountered a horse in a lachrymose mood.)\\" But for the most part the writing is very successful.<br /><br />The Labors of Aeneas includes a handful of notes and an appendix of major gods. The book might have been improved by the addition of an introduction--covering Vergil's biography, for example, the history of Rome in a nutshell--but it is not strictly necessary. Readers who are unacquainted with the book's subject matter will find that the author does a good job injecting explanatory material into her account. Her book is, in short, a well-written introduction to the world Vergil describes. Readers should find it both instructive and entertaining.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecee writing is very successful.<br /><br />The Labors of Aeneas includes a handful of notes and an appendix of major gods.

Annie Seymour arrives at the scene early, disheveled and hung over but ready to pry what information she can from the policemen on the scene, including the one she'd been sleeping with an hour earlier. Annie, the protagonist of Karen Olson's debut novel Sacred Cows, is the police reporter for the New Haven Herald. (The Herald is a fictional stand-in for the author's real-life employer, the New Haven Register. Olson is the newspaper's travel editor.) Annie has been on the paper's cop beat for four years, but her investigation into this case will mark new territory for her. It is, for one thing, a political hot potato. The deceased is quickly identified as a Yale undergraduate, sophomore Melissa Peabody. The Yale connection means that the Herald will be under considerable pressure from both school and local officials to downplay the seedier aspects of the case. This won't be easy, as the case turns out to be very seedy indeed. Melissa Peabody's murder winds up involving an escort service, and Annie's investigation leads her to uncover some dirty laundry in City Hall itself. The man behind the dirt is New Haven's assistant corporation counsel, Mark Torrey, who was with Melissa on the night she died and may well have killed her. He may kill Annie as well: he is at least not above attempting to silence her by violent means once she gets too close to the truth. Compounding these complications is Annie's personal life: her relationship with the detective working the case amounts to a huge conflict of interest for both of them.<br /><br />Sacred Cows is the first book in what will evidently be a series of Annie Seymour mysteries, and I for one am pleased. Annie is a strong enough character to anchor a series--likeable, but imperfect and given to obscenity and pleasantly curmudgeonly. (After studiously avoiding meeting her neighbors for years, she laments finally coming face-to-face with the people who share her Wooster Square brownstone. \\"I would have to say hello on the stairs, let them into the building if they forgot their keys, help them with grocery bags. Oh, God, I might have to move.\\") Much of Annie's cantankerousness is directed at Dick Whitfield, an annoyingly eager but otherwise inoffensive cub reporter type who follows her around puppy-like on this investigation in the hopes of making a name for himself. But others catch Annie's wrath as well--her society matron-cum-successful attorney mother; the mysterious winking man she keeps running into, a sexy Frank Sinatra look-alike who seems to know her; and not least the cows of the book's title, the herd of painted fiberglass bovine statues that descends on New Haven in the middle of the story. The cows annoy Annie by their mere presence in town, particularly after she is ordered to report on their doings for the paper. (Olson takes Annie's negative reaction to the cows a hair's breadth too far when she describes her as giving one particular cow, dressed in doctor's scrubs, a wide berth: \\"I took a deep breath and got out [of the car], careful not to get too close to the Doctor Cow. You never know when you'll end up in the Twilight Zone and one of those things would come charging at you.\\") Apart from their role as focal point for Annie's annoyance, the cows don't contribute much to the storyline, though I suspect the book's title refers as much to Yale's position in New Haven as it does to the fiberglass beasts themselves.<br /><br />Olson writes well, and her plot is for the most part credible, though two of the book's details struck me as unlikely: that Annie would buzz someone into her apartment without finding out first who it is when she has every reason to believe someone is trying to kill her, and--more incredible yet--that a librarian working at the circulation desk of Yale's Sterling Memorial Library would be able to point to where a particular undergraduate is studying in the cavernous building when asked. But that Yale's library and colleges provide the backdrop to Olson's mystery is a fact to be celebrated. As a New Haven-area resident myself, I very much appreciate the local flavor with which Olson imbues her book: pizza and the Peabody Museum, Atticus Books and Willoughby's and Sleeping Giant State Park. I look forward to Annie Seymour's next appearance on the local authors table at Atticus.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceraduate is studying in the cavernous building when asked.

In prose that flows so smoothly you'll want to down the whole of it in one sitting Alan Alda, whose TV personae most of us will have admired for years, shows himself to be in real life an affable, intelligent, intellectually curious, normal, nice guy. Who can write well. He begins with one of the best first lines of a book I've ever read: \\"My mother didn't try to stab my father until I was six, but she must have shown signs of oddness before that.\\" And he goes on to tell the story of his life in roughly chronological order: from a dysfunctional childhood spent in the wings of the burlesque theaters in which his father worked, to his own years--many of them--as a struggling actor, to the more lucrative period of his career.<br /><br />Never Have Your Dog Stuffed is not what one might expect of a celebrity memoir, not only because it is so very good but also because there is, you come to realize, so very little celebrity in it. Alda notices this himself about two-thirds of the way into the book in a prelude to his discussion of the amusing and unpleasant side effects of fame. (\\"This is what getting famous does to you, I thought. You wind up sending suicidal people form letters.\\") Alda does not here recite his stepping stones to greatness. He rather gives an honest account of his growth as an actor and a person over the years--how his intellect was challenged and changed, how he struggled to act rather than just perform. Nor does he shy away from self-criticism. There are no great faux pas to which Alda must confess, no substance abuse or extra-marital dalliances, but he does something arguably more difficult. He writes about the ambivalence he felt for his parents--his father Robert, with whom he often felt himself in competition, and his mentally ill mother. And he shows himself to have behaved badly toward his father, in particular, in small moments that apparently seared his conscience. Alda's discussions of his parents' deaths are the most poignant of the book.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Alda is also sometimes funny in the book (\\"Apparently, you can offer to disembowel me, but I'll still see if I can make you laugh.\\") But he is nothing at all like the smooth-talking, gregarious, Groucho-esque character he played in M*A*S*H. That Alda does not share Hawkeye's personality did not surprise me. Why should he? But I was surprised that in reading Alda's memoir I almost forgot about M*A*S*H and Hawkeye Pierce completely.<br /><br />Obviously this book comes very highly recommended. Buy it and enjoy it. Like me you may find yourself reading the last page very slowly in a vain attempt to keep it from ending.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecedeaths are the most poignant of the book.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Alda is also sometimes funny in the book (\\"Apparently, you can offer to disembowel me, but I'll still see if I can make you laugh.\\") But he is nothing at all like the smooth-talking, gregarious, Groucho-esque character he played in M*A*S*H.

Proctor is suspected of multiple murders, most recently that of his former colleague Bruce Shimoda, with whom he had once worked on the creation of a top-secret virtual world. He is also suspected of bombing the lab that he and Shimoda shared some twenty years earlier, back in 2002, an explosion which happened to kill his own wife. Saskia Brandt, in contrast, doesn't know her own back-story, but she does know that she works for the FIB, Europe's Federal Investigation Bureau, and that she's been ordered to capture Proctor. Saskia also knows that she is super-human insofar as manifold bits of information have been implanted in her brain. She quite literally knows things she doesn't know she knows: should she find herself in the cockpit of an airplane, for example, she may or may not discover that she is an expert pilot. Using investigative skills she'd been unaware she possessed, Saskia follows Proctor across continents, a high-tech chase scene that will leave readers, if not breathless, certainly interested.<br /><br />D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is a smart read filled with clever, fresh dialogue:<br /><br />\\"Saskia stared, unfocused, at the wall. 'If I fail, what will happen to me?'<br /><br />'For murder?' The death penalty. Although after the Richter ruling, you might be lucky and just have your brain wiped. Street-cleaning isn't so bad. They wear epaulettes.'\\"<br /><br />The book offers readers an intriguing mystery right from the get-go: Saskia, who is being framed herself for murder at the book's opening, must solve the crime before a refrigerator repairman arrives in her office the next day. (Really. It is the scene early on in which Saskia discovers the corpse she's allegedly responsible for that hooked me on the book.) The plot of D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is intricate enough to leave readers pondering its twists long after they've finished it. It may indeed be a bit too complicated, or may at least occasionally leave too much unexplained: I was left with a few questions that might require a second reading to clear up. In particular, the almost dreamlike segments in the book in which the characters are acting in the virtual environment Proctor helped create can be confusing and are less satisfying than the rest of the story. That said, I very much enjoyed the world Hocking has created and the characters with which he's populated it.<br /><br />While the virtual world Hocking's scientists created left me cold, I was otherwise smitten with the author's view of the future, in particular with its cool gadgetry. In the 2020's, computers are everywhere. Driverless taxis tool around providing easy transport. Refrigerators self-diagnose and summon repairmen when appropriate. Best of all is the computer prototype that David Proctor makes so much use of: Ego is a close to omniscient, credit-card-sized personal computer that is forever increasing its own store of knowledge and performing helpful tricks. Ego constantly scans innumerable sources--the internet, police communications, spy novels--for information relevant to its master's situation, and upon command it is ready to act as an interpreter or magnetic card key, a voice-activated recorder or explosive device, a lie detector or, well, an iPod. In short, I want one.

US	52923654	R246ZWKYO3HMU0	037541360X	929921135	The Tulip and the Pope: A Nun's Story	Books	4	70	75	N	N	A highly readable look behind the closed doors of a convent	Anyone who ever attended Catholic school will understand why Deborah Larsen was so curious in her youth about convent life. Surely we girls all wondered, at least--we shapeless lumps in knee-highs and pleated skirts--what the nuns who taught us did behind closed doors, how their communal life was organized. That same curiosity is what will draw readers to Ms. Larsen's memoir, The Tulip and the Pope, an account of the nearly five years the author spent as a nun some forty years ago among the BVMs, the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<br /><br />To most of us the lifestyle Larsen and her fellow postulants to the order adopted upon \\"entering religion\\" would be anything but appealing: not only was complete obedience to one's superiors in the order required, but postulants had also in effect to renounce their individuality. One could not own anything: even the habit a nun donned with such attention, pinning and snapping it into position with the greatest care, was considered communal property. All mail, incoming and outgoing, was screened and might or might not be delivered at the discretion of one's superiors. Nuns were forbidden to establish \\"particular friendships\\" with one another lest anyone among them be left out. Postulants could not bring their own books into the convent and could thus read only the religious publications provided there for them. Nuns were to practice \\"custody of the eyes,\\" not making eye contact with one another, not looking about willy-nilly at the world around them.<br /><br />The convent as Larsen describes it is a stark, black-and-white place, a sensory-deprived world in which a young woman might understandably look forward, as Larsen did, to the task of cleaning out the convent's walk-in freezer: a perk of this job was that the person performing it had to wear a particular sweater, one that happened to be green rather than white or black and thus set its wearer apart from her Sisters. Almost as if she were an individual. In this world the responsibility for decision-making was taken from the individual, who lived content in the knowledge that in doing anything by order of her superiors she was doing God's will: \\"...the day-to-day living of Holy Obedience was pretty simple. Simple in the extreme as a matter of fact: your Sister superior's will for you is expressive of the Will of God. If the superior has you on the duty list for scrubbing toilets, that is God's Will for you. How positively joyful that you are certain that when you are cleaning the toilets, that is God's Will.\\" One could see the appeal of this trouble-free existence, it being a kind of extended childhood, if the price of not having to balance a checkbook and make mortgage payments and pick out one's own clothes were not deemed exorbitant.<br /><br />What is remarkable about Larsen's thoughtful book is that she does manage to convey to readers what the appeal of the convent was for her. One understands her decision to commit herself to that ascetic lifestyle at nineteen, and one understands equally well her decision some five years later to walk out the convent's front door onto the snowy streets of Dubuque, Iowa, no longer wearing her habit. But while she is implicitly critical of the religious life when explaining the intellectual process by which she came to reject the convent, Larsen is by no means disdainful of it.<br /><br />Although the outcome of Larsen's memoir is foreordained--the author's bio, after all, makes it clear that she did not remain in the convent--the book offers readers a sort of suspense. We know that the heroine will emerge safe, if you will, at the book's end, but fear nonetheless in the reading that she won't make it, that she'll surrender herself to the Church and live with her eyes perpetually downcast. Fortunately Ms. Larsen did not choose that for herself forty years ago, and she has, among many other things no doubt, a highly readable memoir to show for it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel,author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceauthor of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-09-14

A very good read	We know almost from the outset of his story that Eric Lavender's marriage is in trouble. He is, after all, telling that story from a holding cell in the Scarsdale Police Department, and it's a complaint from Eric's wife that's landed him there. But only a few weeks earlier Eric had been obliviously happy in his three-and-a-half-year marriage to Colleen, a divorce attorney known to her colleagues--if not her husband--as a barracuda when it comes to extracting blood from her clients' exes. Colleen's opening shot in a battle Eric had only dimly been aware was brewing is the police report she's filed alleging that Eric sexually molested his stepdaughter, Colleen's four-year-old from a previous relationship. Sitting on the hard bench in his cell with time on his hands, Eric begins to explain how things fell apart for him, a tale whose roots go back to the day he met Colleen. Four years earlier, still recovering from the emotional trauma of being abandoned by her husband while she was pregnant, Colleen boldly took the lead in wooing and winning Eric. In less than a year he'd left behind his apartment and his psychotherapy practice in New York and moved into her Scarsdale home, where he set about talking the community's pampered scions through their relatively uninteresting problems.<br /><br />The trouble in their marriage starts when the wife of one of Eric's patients hires Colleen as a divorce lawyer. Colleen's hostile behavior when confronted with the problem of this conflict of interest--she and Eric are now ranged on either side of a domestic dispute--prompts Eric to take a closer look at the enigmatic woman he's married to. He gradually uncovers evidence that suggests she has been less than truthful to him about her background. The story of Eric's relationship with Colleen becomes mesmerizing as he slowly peels back the layers of his wife's perfidy, discovering as he does that he hardly knows her, that he cannot trust the woman who, chillingly, is now, as he's telling the story, acting as sole parent to their daughters.<br /><br />Elizabeth Benedict's The Practice of Deceit is one of those rare books one is loath to see the end of. Smoothly written and well plotted, the book manages to be both quiet and suspenseful. I would have preferred that the final chapter of the book not be epistolary in form, and there is one action taken by the protagonist that continues to confuse me (his call to a client while in prison), but these are minor quibbles about a very good book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceng the story, acting as sole parent to their daughters.<br /><br />Elizabeth Benedict's The Practice of Deceit is one of those rare books one is loath to see the end of.

The three women have left their Westchester home to attend the reburial of Leona's maternal uncle, whose grave is to be moved to the Israeli side of the country's border with Jordan. At the same time an extended visit with her birth family is intended as a comfort to Liana's mother after the recent death--by apparent suicide--of her husband. The tragic stories behind the deaths of these two men, Liana's father and uncle, though only hinted at in the book, form the backdrop to Liana's coming-of-age story.<br /><br />Set amidst the barbed-wire borders of pre-1967 Jerusalem, Edges is more concerned with the figurative boundaries between Liana and her mother, whom Liana simultaneously loves and is repelled by. Certainly there is much in her mother, as Skolkin-Smith describes her, to send one screaming: \\"Her body was usually without undergarments which gave the sheets a hot, wettish odor. Her hair and face creams gave off a strong, fruity smell and tempered the raw coarse aromas that got loose from her flesh.\\" In this and other passages the author paints Liana's mother as aesthetically odious--just the sort of way a girl of fourteen might view her mother. But reeking of sweat and other bodily fluids as she is, Liana's mother is not the only thing that smells in this book. Skolkin-Smith's Jerusalem is filled with the unappealing odors of food and people as well as of cocktail napkins, orgasms, and mirrors (which smell respectively like walnuts, curdled milk, and \\"sweat and old yarn\\").<br /><br />We can view with sympathy Liana's desire to free herself from her mother's stifling, sweaty, noisome affection, if not the dramatic means by which she eventually makes good her escape. Her story becomes entwined with that of an American boy who's recently gone missing and whose disappearance has caused a national stir. Apparently the boy doesn't want to be found, but why this should be is never made clear.<br /><br />Skolkin-Smith's Edges is a quiet novel filled with small moments. Much of the story is told in dialogue, the stilted English of Israelis conversing in an unfamiliar tongue. They pepper their speech with untranslated Hebrew, which may be off-putting to readers unfamiliar with that language. More problematic for my own appreciation of the novel is that the various characters often have fractured encounters with one another that don't quite make sense:<br /><br />\\"Two small nuns in black bowed in front of some ruins, and a priest with a scarlet-red Russian turban was smoking a cigarette beside a church door. He saw us and crossed the vestibule.\\"<br /><br />\\"'I am American. Christian. Does it matter?'\\" my mother began, and he waved us along, away from him.\\"<br /><br />Skolkin-Smith's characters rarely express themselves fully, much falling between their words. (Liana, for example, runs off with the American boy without the two ever having a conversation to that effect beforehand.) This imperfect communication probably reflects real-life dialogue well, but it is difficult to follow on the page.<br /><br />Readers who like their prose on the poetic side--and anyone interested in a story that evokes the sights and sentiments and indeed the smells of 1960's Jerusalem--should give Skolkin-Smith's novel a look.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecebe found, but why this should be is never made clear.<br /><br />Skolkin-Smith's Edges is a quiet novel filled with small moments.

In the few months since he's moved from Texas to the quaint English village of Snupperton-Mumsley, Simon has stumbled over at least as many corpses as Murder She Wrote's Jessica Fletcher encounters on an average book tour. And like that grand dame of polite cozies, Simon too is a prolific writer, the author of well-respected historical biographies as well as two series of books, romances and mysteries, which he publishes pseudonymously. Enticing as his secret life of letters is, Simon's forays into lower-brow literature are not his only secret: he also happens to be a vampire, a gay vampire, in a world in which, however, medical advances have taken away much of the unpleasantness associated with that condition. Simon does try to limit his exposure to sunlight, and garlic remains a no-no, but he neither requires nor desires the blood-quaffing that has given generations of vampires a bad reputation. Or, at least, Simon never used to have such cravings....<br /><br />In this third installment in Dean James' amusing series of vampire cozies, our gentlemanly undead protagonist finds himself in the uncomfortable position of gazing upon his acquaintances' pulsing neck veins with something approaching lust: the pills he takes thrice daily to ward off his vampiric impulses seem to be failing--a delicious development. There is also, of course, a murder: Zeke Harwood, the flamboyant host of the popular decorating show Tr&egrave;s Zeke, is bludgeoned to death while redoing the drawing room of nearby Blitherington Hall.<br /><br />Decorated to Death offers readers another good mystery. For those coming to the series for the first time, the author does a good job for the most part of weaving the necessary background information into his narrative, though further explanation of the woman Simon refers to as his Nemesis would have served even repeat readers well.

Derek's not a bright guy, but his crimes were meticulously planned: the Voice, after all, had given him very precise instructions. Elevated by his acts of sadism, Derek was changed from one of life's losers to a somebody whose crimes could terrorize a community and stump the police, at least for a while. But two years on, with Derek safely behind the bars of his asylum, it's happening again: prostitutes are being killed in precisely the same way, grisly details that had never been released to the public replicated in a gory reprise of the earlier murders. And the Voice is commanding a new killer.<br /><br />The elite major incident squad investigating the killings has brought in Britain's top psychological profiler to consult on the case, but Dr. Tony Hill is, frankly, at a loss. There is no doubt that Derek Tyler was guilty of the first crimes, and a copycat killer would need inside information about the Tyler murders to reenact them. More problematic is that no one else would want to reenact the murders, at least not for the purpose of satisfying their own sexual fantasies. As Dr. hill repeatedly insists, no two people committing sexually motivated homicides will derive satisfaction from the same complex of details--how their victims are bound, how they are tortured, how they are killed.<br /><br />While Tony Hill tries to enter the mind of the maniac cleaning up Bradfield's red-light district, the city's police department, under the leadership of DCI Carol Jordan, investigates the crime by more traditional means--poring through paperwork, interrogating everyone working and living in the seedy area in which the crimes took place, and planting an undercover policewoman among the city's vulnerable working girls.<br /><br />Val McDermid's The Torment of Others, the fourth book in her series featuring profiler Tony Hill, is a solid police procedural and simply a very good read: well-written, with likeable but flawed good guys, creepy bad guys, and a plot that will keep you guessing until Tony himself starts putting the pieces together. And when he does that, some 60 pages from the book's close, readers will be hard pressed indeed to put this one down.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceing profiler Tony Hill, is a solid police procedural and simply a very good read: well-written, with likeable but flawed good guys, creepy bad guys, and a plot that will keep you guessing until Tony himself starts putting the pieces together.

US	52923654	R9KLDIMYZG100	0743260031	297692250	Assassination Vacation	Books	4	9	13	N	N	Fascinating, but uneven	Sarah Vowell's Assassination Vacation is a sort of historical road trip, a digressive account, with a personal spin, of the events and personalities, the places, memorials, and memorabilia connected with the first three presidential assassinations in the United States--the murders of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley. Vowell devotes a chapter to each president--Lincoln, not surprisingly, gets the most ink--and closes the book with a brief fourth chapter on, primarily, the Lincoln Memorial. In her presidential chapters Vowell discusses the antecedents to and political context of the assassins' crimes, including the sort of homely details that bring her subjects' stories to life. And she describes with an infectious delight the locations at which historically important events occurred, the sorts of places, often plaque-bearing, that one can easily pass on the street without recognizing their significance. She visits the usual suspects on her tour, the Ford Theater, say, but there are many unexpected stops as well--the site of the shop at which Charles Giteau purchased the gun he would use to kill President Garfield, the island prison where Samuel Mudd, the doctor who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg, was incarcerated in the 1860s.<br /><br />Vowell imparts a lot of information in the book. Some of it comes in large chunks which she makes more palatable in an interesting way: she frequently writes about her conversations with third parties, some friend she's pressed into driving her around, or a tour group guide, and rather than weighing down her paragraphs with monotonously related facts and figures, she rattles them off at what seems to be high speed to these poor souls while her readers look on. It turns out to be an effective device. That Vowell abuses her friends by boring them with historical lectures is also a part of her self-presentation in the book: she paints herself as a sort of uber-nerd whose quirks, including her fascination with dead presidents, her friends tolerate only with difficulty. (\\"That is the kind of person I have become,\\" she writes of her sister's Christmas present to her of a single hair from the head of abolitionist John Brown, \\"the kind of person who rips open a package in snowman wrapping paper to discover that her only sister has bought her an executed slavery hater's hair.\\") It's cute, though it sometimes seems that she's trying a little too hard to be quirky.<br /><br />Vowell writes very well, and she's often funny. (\\"Once I knew my dead presidents and I had become insufferable, I started to censor myself. There were a lot of get-togethers with friends where I didn't hear half of what was being said because I was sitting there, silently chiding myself, Don't bring up McKinley. Don't bring up McKinley.\\") Much of what Vowell has to say, moreover, is downright fascinating, the kind of stuff you'll be mentioning to your friends: Did you know, for example, that Edwin Booth, John Wilkes Booth's brother, once saved the life of Robert Todd Lincoln? Or that the younger Lincoln was in close proximity to all three of these assassinations? (Vowell clearly loves this detail: she refers to Lincoln early in the book as \\"some kind of jinxed Zelig of doom\\" and later on as, well, \\"Jinxy McDeath.\\") Or did you know that Henry Rathbone, the guy who was in the box with Lincoln at Ford's Theater, subsequently moved to Germany, went crazy, and shot and killed his wife? This is great material.<br /><br />But Vowell's book, unfortunately, is uneven: cute and funny and fascinating in parts, it is also sometimes slow and weighed down by the author's less successful attempts at being folksy. Like the aforementioned \\"Jinxy McDeath,\\" or the too lengthy discussions of her macabre three-year-old nephew Owen, or a bizarre digression on the Fox television show The O.C. and it's star's fertile eyebrows. References like the last are unfortunate also because they will date the book, as will her frequent diatribes against President Bush, which she shoehorns into the text whenever possible. Despite its faults, however, Assassination Vacation has enough going for it that it remains very much worth the read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecenst President Bush, which she shoehorns into the text whenever possible.

US	52923654	R21KMTZCFVTI09	0975254014	404024534	The Amadeus Net	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A comic dance in a post-apocalyptic utopia	The premise of Mark Rayner's The Amadeus Net is an odd one. In 2028 Mozart--Wolfgang Amadeus, that is, the composer--is alive and well and 272 years old, blessed or cursed with immortality for reasons beyond his ken. Having faked his own death in 1791 he lives pseudonymously, currently as William Armstrong (note the initials), and has been supporting himself by selling new compositions as his own \\"lost\\" works. Eighteen years before the narrative begins a massive asteroid had hit the Earth's Antarctic pole, causing cataclysmic geographic changes, but in this ugly post-apocalyptic world Mozart and a few other visionaries founded a utopia, Ipolis, on an island that had only recently pushed its way above the surface of the Pacific Ocean. By design, Ipolis attracts artists and scientists from around the world, who work for the improvement of humanity in a highly computerized, networked society. The experiment might not have worked at all, except that Ipolis itself became--unbeknownst to its creators and inhabitants--a sentient being. As a benevolent near-god Ipolis looks after its residents, and the rest of the world to the extent that it can, keeping an eye in particular on its favorite son, Mozart.<br /><br />During the week covered by Rayner's narrative the world outside Ipolis stands poised on the brink of nuclear war. And even in utopia things aren't perfect. An unscrupulous reporter suspects the truth about Will Armstrong and is bent on exposing him. With her posse of helpmates--a love-sick diplomat and an aging soldier of fortune--she pursues Mozart while he chases a pseudo-lesbian nurse, who herself has eyes for the reporter, who rebuffs the advances of the diplomat, who hooks up with the sadistic painter, who creates a high-tech piece of art based on Mozart's memories.... In short, the book's six principals repel and attract one another in a sort of comic dance during what may be civilization's last seven days.<br /><br />The Amadeus Net has a few problems. Rayner signals that one character's speech is uncultivated by having her drop the g's from her present participles, an effect which is very annoying to read. And it is odd that the hot-shot reporter stalking Will Armstrong has such difficulty discovering his home address: Ipolis evidently could use a good white pages. More importantly, the book's action is slow to get going. Readers may not have the patience to persevere while the various characters introduce themselves and the setting of the story is explained.<br /><br />That said, the book is well-written, and once one gets into the meat of the story its principals are interesting enough to keep readers' attention. Perhaps most likeable is the character of Ipolis itself, whose benevolent governance of its residents includes shielding them from incoming missiles, controlling the weather, and spiking the water supply of intimate couples with birth-control drugs unless they're actively trying to reproduce. The Amadeus Net is not the sort of book that you won't be able to put down, but you'll definitely want to pick it up again once you do.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceer signals that one character's speech is uncultivated by having her drop the g's from her present participles, an effect which is very annoying to read.

US	52923654	R1EZC0XJ98KL88	0312992289	298733702	Paranoia	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A riveting thriller	Adam Cassidy was just another drudge in a cubicle farm, doing as little as he had to to keep his job at Wyatt Telecommunications. But his practiced underachievement ended suddenly the day after he effectively embezzled $78,000 from his employer: Adam threw an elaborate catered party for a retiring dock worker and billed the affair to the company. Adam's prank, as he naively thought of it, attracted the attention of the company's megalomaniacal president Nick Wyatt, who found something to like in his employee's attempts to talk his way out of trouble. He issued Adam an ultimatum: serious jail time unless he agreed to become a mole in another technologies company, Wyatt rival Trion Systems. An intense few weeks of training followed while Adam was groomed--literally and figuratively--for his new role. He emerged from Wyatt's crash course with the look and (faked) credentials of a rising corporate superstar, and with the know-how that would allow him to land a job at Trion and defeat the company's elaborate security systems once he got there.<br /><br />Adam's story, told in the first person, becomes increasingly suspenseful the longer our hero stays at Trion. Working with unprecedented fervor by day in order to fake his way in a position for which he is not qualified, Adam is forced to spend many of his nights prowling around the darkened headquarters of Trion, breaking into offices, scamming security guards, riffling through top secret files. His actions are fraught with danger, and they become increasingly difficult for him morally as well. Fed information on the sly by Wyatt, Adam appears at work as a kind of Wunderkind and moves up the corporate ladder with impressive celerity. Now enjoying constant access to Trion's founder and president, Adam becomes fond of the man whose company he is doing his best to undermine.<br /><br />Finder's novel is an exciting, well-written, fast read. Though filled with corporate speak and technical jargon, the book is never weighed down by it. And the corporate world to which Finder introduces us, with its petty politics and hierarchical struggles, is fascinating. The story's various twists and the increasingly impossible position in which Cassidy finds himself will keep readers riveted.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceown by it.

Voldemort is back and the Death Eaters, the dark wizard's evil minions, have begun claiming victims. Meanwhile, in the relatively safe haven that is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher has been installed, the sixth DADA instructor in as many years. And Hogwarts's newest faculty member, a certain Horace Slughorn, seeks to gather Harry--\\"The Chosen One,\\" as the Daily Prophet is now calling him--into his flock of favorites. Harry, however, is spending his time instead in the company of Hogwarts's headmaster: he and Dumbledore clamber about in other people's memories throughout much of the book--a trick achieved with the use of Dumbledore's handy pensieve. Ron and Hermione, not privy to these adventures, pass their time instead simmering at a slightly higher temperature than usual. The book simmers as well, building slowly, almost quietly, as Rowling plays with readers, making us wonder repeatedly whether we know for certain where her characters' allegiances lie. We find out for certain--or so we must think, anyway--in the dramatic events that unfold toward the book's end, when the identity of the Half-Blood Prince of the book's title is revealed and Rowling's latest read becomes--fans will not be surprised--nearly unputdownable.<br /><br />One can criticize J.K. Rowling's sixth book on a few counts. The author does not throw out very many life preservers to those of us who have not recently read or reread the earlier books in the series, frequently alluding to characters and events from previous installments without reminding us of their significance, which can be confusing. The identity of the Half-Blood Prince, too, once revealed, is not as important as readers are led to expect. And the final chapter of the book, while some of its material is necessary to complete the story, is over-long and makes for an unfortunately dull conclusion. But these are relatively small complaints. After many thousands of pages, Rowling's prose continues very much the same--a kind of straightforward, unaffected writing that gets the story across without slowing things down, a style that has proved unusually accessible to a vast readership. In the six volumes of her oeuvre Rowling has carefully and vividly brought to life a complex, fully realized world, plucked from her imagination, one that will stand on its own and continue to engage the imagination of audiences long after Rowling herself is able to oversee it (much like the universe of Gene Rodenberry's Star Trek in this respect). Her creation of this alternate world, so real to her readers, is, I believe, a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecestory, is over-long and makes for an unfortunately dull conclusion.

The first is Steve Keeley--a super-charged businessman type who's looking to gain the vice presidency of his company within a few weeks of the book's opening, and looking to propose to his girlfriend within twenty-four hours. His path will eventually cross that of Mike McNair, the brilliant physicist in charge of a 12-billion-dollar independently-funded super collider in Texas aimed at discovering the \\"God particle\\" of the book's title, a theoretical particle physicists believe gives mass to other particles. The book opens promisingly: readers quickly feel a sick sense of dread as Steve, on a business trip to Switzerland, is pursued by an overly aggressive female employee whom we suspect--and whom he suspects--might very well \\"tumble off her precarious ledge of good judgment and fall into the Fatal Attraction abyss.\\" But nothing comes of this, and more unpleasant events propel Steve toward his true fate, a fall from a third-floor window that leaves him with a serious head injury. He undergoes brain surgery and survives, but during his convalescence Steve begins hallucinating and finds that, among other things, he can sometimes read people's minds.<br /><br />Steve's story eventually becomes the less frequently visited of the book's two storylines. We read about Mike McNair's work and his incipient relationship with a certain Kelly, an attractive anchorwoman with whom he exchanges emails laced with scientific and religious musings. One cares about Mike and wants his relationship with Kelly to work out, but in the end what happens between the two does not matter very much to the story. And while some of their weighty philosophical back-and-forth is necessary to provide readers with background information about Mike's work, it tends to slow the narrative down, particularly when they continue the discussion as the book's denouement approaches. In the end, Steve's and Mike's stories intersect, as Steve's hallucinations, he begins to think, are somehow related to the God particle, though precisely why he and the book's bad guys converge on Mike's super collider at the same time was never very clear to me. By the book's end, meanwhile, Steve has become a secondary character, and the people who filled out his story at the book's beginning--his parents, his amorous employee, his would-be fianc&eacute;e--have been mostly forgotten. After an unsatisfying ending one leaves the novel feeling that the story never quite came together--that several characters in the book never fulfilled the promise of their introductions.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceapproaches.

Moran begins with her early interest in espionage--childhood fantasies fueled by spy novels and James Bond matinees--and her first application to the Agency, right out of college, which she did not pursue past an informational meeting in a Washington D.C. Holiday Inn. (\\"The CIA representatives who greeted us were somewhat disappointing: a dowdy, middle-aged woman with thick glasses and orthopedic shoes, and a paunchy, balding guy who had the aura of someone just completing a messy divorce.\\") Five years later, however, Moran reapplied to the Agency, over her family's objections, and this time she saw the process through to the end.<br /><br />Moran spends a little more than half of her book detailing the intensive training that she underwent at The Farm, the CIA's site in Virginia. She and her fellow would-be spooks learned how to defuse bombs and jump out of planes. They practiced wearing disguises and ramming beat-up Cadillacs through walls and fences and lines of parked cars. Plunked down separately in a wilderness area, they were required to navigate to a specified location using only a contour map and a compass, a feat the trainees accomplished with varying degrees of success. (\\"Sally was found close to dark, half naked in a swamp. Frustrated by her inability to find her destination, she'd inexplicably decided to bathe.\\")<br /><br />After graduating from The Farm Moran was sent to Skopje, Macedonia, a post for which she learned Serbo-Croatian (and such handy phrases as \\"Some of the women were raped, but all the men were killed.\\") As a case officer for the CIA, Moran's primary job was to recruit foreign agents--people who had access to information and would be willing to sell it--and to maintain the agents who were already under her control. Some of her job had a cloak-and-dagger excitement to it--clandestine meetings and coded signals--but much of it was dull, from the reams of paperwork she was required to fill out to the necessity of listening to some low-level agent's marital complaints during a meeting. Perhaps it is a reflection of the banality of much of her work as a spy that Moran's narrative, downright fascinating in the first half of the book, is less compelling in the second.<br /><br />Two themes run throughout Moran's book. She complains often about the difficulty she had as a CIA operative maintaining non-Agency relationships. The easy lies and ostensibly bizarre behavior of spies--the odd hours and unexplained departures--take their toll on friendships and love affairs. And Moran was ill at ease even during her training about the nature of the work she would be required to do as a CIA case officer, preying on targets, approaching them under false pretences, and using their vulnerabilities as a means of convincing them to sell their state's secrets. Moran's loneliness on the job and her moral discomfort with it were jointly responsible for her decision to resign from the Agency in 2003.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeced a cloak-and-dagger excitement to it--clandestine meetings and coded signals--but much of it was dull, from the reams of paperwork she was required to fill out to the necessity of listening to some low-level agent's marital complaints during a meeting.

TV on, Rodney barely listens to her complaints, and something inside Kate snaps. It was a long time coming, we learn, as Kate falls later into an alcohol-washed sleep, and we fall with her out of the book's prologue and into Kate's past. We land thirty years later in 1965 and watch Kate's sometimes heart-rending struggles to assert her independence from her sharp-tongued mother Biddy, a woman who doles out her love so stintingly that Kate remains hungry for more of it for the rest of her life. For the next thirty years Kate never really manages to shake off her mother's dampening influence. Her life follows the usual arc: college and marriage, friendships and motherhood. She is by no means miserable, but true happiness is precluded by her relationships with her mother and her spouse: she is smothered by the former's expectations, and virtually ignored by the extraordinarily egocentric Rodney.<br /><br />Cover the Butter--the title, at least in its literal sense, refers to her parents' post-prandial habit of doing just that--is a nicely written, often moving story. While its subject matter is on the heavy side--mothers can crush their young, and men can be bastards--the book is not a depressing read. Its writing is lively and light, and Kate's soul is never in fact extinguished by the innumerable injustices and small abuses she is made to bear. The book, however, is over-long. Some 30-50 pages could probably have been cut without it losing its impact, and a tighter story would have made a more gripping read. Even at its current length, however, the book comes recommended: the author tells Kate's story well, and it's a tale that a lot of women will probably recognize as an exaggerated version of their own lives.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Live in Ancient Greeces a tale that a lot of women will probably recognize as an exaggerated version of their own lives.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Live in Ancient Greece	2005-07-26

Weekdays find him working two jobs--assisting alternately at a bar and a funeral home--and sharing in the task of raising his five-year-old daughter, who lives full-time with her mother. Weekends he is more often than not drunk and belligerent to the point of exciting police attention. Jason Headley's debut novel follows Eric's life in the present, a chapter a day, through one unusually eventful week, from a Sunday morning hangover endured in the local jail to the following Saturday, when everything--and nothing--has changed. The seven chapters devoted to Eric's present are interspersed with chapters detailing slices from his past: his liberation of a Playboy Magazine from someone's stolen stash when he was twelve; the big game against his town's arch-rivals that Eric won more or less single-handedly during his senior year; the birth of his daughter. Gradually the pieces of Eric's life, related out of sequence, recombine to explain the mystery of his character: how a top student, a hero on the gridiron, a man whose innate goodness is plain to see--despite the darker side that reveals itself when he drinks--how such a man came only seven years after his high school triumphs to be squandering his life in a kind of hopeless holding pattern.<br /><br />Jason Headley's Small Town Odds is an elegant, gorgeously written novel. And it is well plotted, the various elements of Eric's quiet drama lining up as they are meant to and leading inevitably to the book's denouement, but not in such a way that one notices mid-read what the author is doing. Only afterward does one appreciate the story's structure, how a funeral and a football game and the baggage of Eric's past lead finally to resolution. Like Richard Russo, the Pulitzer-winning author of Empire Falls with whom he has been compared, Headley offers readers a charming exploration of life in small-town America, where the cast of characters tends to remain unchanged, and people bump into one another's lives at various points, passing time together and sharing histories and resentments: the sort of aging that makes for complex relationships.

US	52923654	RE9HGBINO9W4L	0805077847	146059692	Close Case (Samantha Kincaid Mysteries)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	An intellectually interesting read	Samantha Kincaid, a Deputy District Attorney in Portland, Oregon, catches a high profile case on the morning of her 32nd birthday, the murder of hot-shot reporter Percy Crenshaw, who was bludgeoned to death during the night in his carport. The apparent solution of the case comes quickly: circumstantial evidence puts two drugged-up teenagers at the scene of the crime. When one of them confesses to the murder, the case seems open and shut. But unfortunately for the D.A.'s office, the methods that were used to extract the suspect's confession may not stand up to scrutiny. And unfortunately for Kincaid, the hot-headed officer whom she must confront over his interrogation techniques is her live-in boyfriend's partner on the force. With Samantha's relationships with the police department and her own personal liaison with it souring over the Crenshaw case, she is put in the even less enviable position of shepherding the racially-charged case of an officer-involved shooting through a grand jury hearing. Sam's relationship with her policeman boyfriend may not survive these twin, work-related assaults.<br /><br />This third installment in author Alafair Burke's Samantha Kincaid series is a sort of \\"D.A. procedural\\"--imagine a Law and Order episode with a bit more Law than Order. I did not come away from the book caring deeply about any of the characters, and the writing is unremarkable (by which I do not mean \\"bad,\\" just transparent), but the story is intriguing. What is particularly good about the book is the author's careful explanation of the case and its complications (perhaps not surprising since the author is herself a former deputy D.A.). We are given an insider's view of a prosecutor's response to a case--the evidence, its handling by the police, the testimony of witnesses, the effect on the case of the personalities involved. The reader comes to appreciate the complications that Samantha faces in seeing the Crenshaw case through, not least of which are the personal problems that arise because her interests as a prosecuting attorney differ from those of the man she lives with. Close Case starts slowly, and what tension there is does not keep one glued to one's seat. But it builds into an intellectually interesting read.

US	52923654	R1D00VMM5KSEIH	0060581069	576689910	I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason (CeCe Caruso Mysteries)	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	An enjoyable romp through genre fiction	With five previous books under her belt, Cece Caruso, the protagonist of Susan Kandel's I Dreamed I Married Perry Mason, is stalled on her sixth, a biography of Erle Stanley Gardner. Gardner is best known as the creator of Perry Mason: he penned more than eighty novels featuring the man Raymond Burr would immortalize for a television audience. But Gardner was also an attorney himself, and he made a point in his career of investigating cases in which he believed an innocent party had been wrongly convicted. He received a great deal of mail, in consequence, from convicts hoping to lure Gardner into taking on their cases. His involvement in these nearly lost causes provides Kandel with the hook for her story, as Cece, while poring through Gardner's correspondence, stumbles upon one of the letters that did not manage to pique the attorney's interest. A certain Joseph Albacco Jr. wrote Gardner in 1958, in Kandel's story, shortly after he was convicted for killing his wife on their first anniversary. Perry Mason's alter-ego may not have taken on the Albacco case, but Cece is struck by the convicted murderer's tone in his letter--humble rather than hostile. She hopes to combat her writer's block by walking in Gardner's shoes for a while and looking into the case. Cece visits Albacco, still moldering in prison forty-odd years hence, and takes upon herself the responsibility of righting an old wrong. Unfortunately for her, as old as Albacco's case may be, there are still people eager to see that the true story of his wife's murder remains safely buried.<br /><br />This first installment in Susan Kandel's series of Cece Caruso mysteries is very appealing. It is a stroke of genius to give her amateur detective the day job of writing the biographies of mystery writers: it allows Kandel, as here, to punctuate her novel with information about the subject of Cece's current writing project. (Next up in the series is Not a Girl Detective, in which Cece takes on Nancy Drew.) The writing is good (\\"I was going for sexy and tousled and vowed not to look in the mirror until bedtime for fear of encountering evidence to the contrary.\\"); the mystery absorbing. Less appealing were Kandel's secondary characters--Cece's daughter and son-in-law; her friend Lael, who lives in apparent chaos with a great many children from a great many fathers; the proprietor of a vintage clothing store Cece frequents: not poorly written, but not interesting or likeable enough to jump off the page. Cece's interest in the designer clothing with which she decks herself also left me cold--though readers will find her obsession with Oscar de la Renta silk saris and the like interesting or not depending on their own proclivities. That said, the quality of writing, the clever plotting, and most especially Kandel's brilliant channeling of Erle Stanley Gardner for this initial offering in the series makes for a winning combination. I look forward to more of Cece's romps through genre fiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceing is good (\\"I was going for sexy and tousled and vowed not to look in the mirror until bedtime for fear of encountering evidence to the contrary.\\"); the mystery absorbing.

Tanina looks like her mother, whom Seth abhorred, except that she has inherited her grandfather's--and her uncle's--blue-black eyes, and apparently their steely resolve and ruthlessness as well. Her appearance prompts from Seth a book-length reverie. His negotiations with Tanina are put on hold as Seth remembers how he has come to be where he is--fifty years old and the only surviving heir (prior to his niece's appearance) to the Delaney-Bathwater fortunes, a man with the eyes of a devil and blood on his hands who stands ready, and is perhaps even relieved, to hand over the keys to his father's company to an untried 21-year-old girl.<br /><br />The story that Seth now recalls begins with the rise of S. Joseph Delaney, Seth's father, an illiterate 17-year-old widower, already the father of twins, who became the wealthy but not quite respectable and still illiterate head of an international company. Delaney accomplished this remarkable feat through sheer intellect, good fortune, alliances with loyal men, and the willingness to achieve his ends through violence when necessary. Joe Delaney's twin boys were joined by three more sons from a second marriage, and the loyalties of this second generation of Delaneys were divided along blood lines, Seth and Sean never quite willing to share power with their half-brothers. Their tendency toward internecine feuding would have guaranteed the Delaneys' unhappiness anyway, but the family's future was further complicated when Sean, unwisely and ineffectively, attempted to avenge the wrongful death of his young wife. The repercussions of his impulsive actions would be felt for decades.<br /><br />One can fault author Shane Kennedy's book on a few points. There are a number of small errors in the text that would almost certainly have been caught had the book been published by a traditional publisher. More importantly, the book's conclusion--one part of it, at least--is contrived, and there are a couple scenes in the book that defy credibility (those involving the wielding of axes in company boardrooms). For someone who is, like myself, fiscally illiterate, moreover, the financial details in the book will be incomprehensible, though they are sparse enough not to slow the narrative down.<br /><br />That said, Highbinders in an impressive piece of fiction. The story jumps around chronologically and is told from multiple perspectives. This might have led to a confusing narrative, but it does not. In fact the book is a collage of well-written scenes that catch and engross the reader. Kennedy manages to invest even his small characters with enough back story to make readers care what happens to them, however short a space is allotted to them in the book. Eventually the story of the Delaney family emerges, through the manifold lenses of its characters, and incredibly, though most of the principals are reprenensible beings, one comes to root for them, or at least to feel pathos over what they've done to themselves. Highbinders is well worth the read. I hope the author finds a broader audience for his work.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecelsive actions would be felt for decades.<br /><br />One can fault author Shane Kennedy's book on a few points.

Beginning with the unusual circumstances in which she entered the profession, Marks writes about difficult passengers and ditsy fellow workers, her brushes with law enforcement and the secret service, cellulite and on-board fires--in short, the perks and problems of flying for a living. Most of the stories Marks tells are at least cute, but some are moving (&#34;Meeting Erma Bombeck;&#34; &#34;Little Hannah Gray&#34;) or downright hilarious--in particular her tale of reciprocal vomiting in &#34;The Most Embarrassing Thing&#34;--and one is both vomit-inducing and funny at the same time (&#34;The Mistaken Beverage&#34;). In the end, like Erma Bombeck herself, Marks's idol and predecessor in the genre of humorous, homely essays, the author comes across as a very pleasant lady. Her book is a quick, diverting read--perfect, in fact, for taking along on your next flight.	2005-06-22

The bad blood between Jean de Carrouges and Jacque Le Gris began with jealousy, as Carrouges watched Le Gris become the favorite of the Count whom both men served as chamberlains. Le Gris was Carrouges's social inferior, and it rankled that he rather than Carrouges was the more successful at court. Further insults followed, and Carrouges became increasingly hostile to his old friend, whom he suspected of plotting against him.<br /><br />The final straw, the crime that led the principals in this story to seek one another's death before thousands of spectators and King Charles VI himself, was Le Gris's alleged rape of Carrouges's wife. Marguerite de Carrouges maintained that Le Gris had attacked her while her husband was away from home. The events of that day--whatever happened to Marguerite in fact--led inexorably to a walled-in jousting field on which the two combatants stabbed and hacked and beat one another until one of them lay dead.<br /><br />Jager does a simply excellent job in this book. He builds the story of Carrouges and Le Gris carefully, describing the causes for complaint between the two and the progress of their feud as well as its historical and social context. We learn in the process about the history of judicial combat and the surprising particulars of the battle itself. The event was not, as one might suppose, an occasion for revelry, with rowdy onlookers yelling insults or encouragement at the fighters. It was instead a solemn event, and impossibly harsh strictures were laid on the spectators to guarantee their good behavior: anyone who rose from his seat during the fight was to be penalized by the loss of a hand; coughing was punishable by death. Most of us would probably quail at the prospect of merely attending such an event, let alone participating in it.<br /><br />But Jager's account is not only informative, it is downright riveting. Because the author has so carefully described the antecedents to the fight and the harsh consequences for the combatants--and for Marguerite herself--riding on the battle's outcome, readers will have their emotions and intellect invested in the story by the time they arrive at Jager's blow-by-blow account of the duel: I defy anyone to put the book down during its penultimate chapter.<br /><br />Whether Le Gris was guilty or innocent is a question that has been debated for centuries, and convincing arguments can be made in support of either position. Jager makes his own opinion about the matter clear, but to his credit he does not obscure the ambiguity inherent in the case, leaving plenty of room for readers to debate for themselves this most fascinating piece of legal history.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceprospect of merely attending such an event, let alone participating in it.<br /><br />But Jager's account is not only informative, it is downright riveting.

Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spiderman, was bitten by a radioactive spider. Clark Kent--&#34;Kal-El&#34; at the time--crashed to Earth after his home planet exploded. And Lady Bird Lee, mild-mannered cashier in an Astro Park, Kansas supermarket, suffered a Horrible Swiffer Accident in her bathroom while attempting to clean an unruly Stain of Unusual Origin with a dangerous combination of household cleaners. Coming to some hours after the event, Birdie found herself a changed woman, a Super Mom equipped with ultra-sensitive hearing, a thunderous voice, and a Merciless Gaze with which she could bend children to her will. The new improved Birdie squirts potent cleaning fluids from her hand and can clean with the power of ten thousand Swiffers. In Confessions of Super Mom Birdie tells her story, from her superheroic origins to her first great crisis as a crime fighter.<br /><br />Once she realizes that her new powers and the mutation of her right hand into a scrubbing pad-like implement amount to superherodom, Birdie sets about cleaning up her town. After engaging a trusty sidekick--her thirteen-year-old, comic-book-loving son Stanley--and equipping herself with an Apron of Anticipation--its pockets filled with Band Aids and a generous supply of animal crackers--she drives around Astro Park sensing trouble and cleaning up messes, both figurative and literal. But being a superhero is not all gushing fans and photo ops. Birdie soon learns that with great power there comes, inevitably, an arch nemesis. Hers is--aren't they all?--one of the town's most illustrious scions, a major employer in the area and, besides, the husband of the president of the PTA. Nor is it easy to fit crime-fighting into the life of the average mother: most superheroes, remember, are not encumbered with the twin burdens of childrearing and parent-teacher meetings. While trying to balance her heroic and homely responsibilities, Birdie must also navigate the unfamiliar waters of a budding romance (her nerdy scientist love interest) and the too familiar moods of her obnoxious ex-husband.<br /><br />The idea behind Confessions of Super Mom--a &#34;superhero for the Swiffer generation,&#34; as the author puts it--is extremely appealing, and Melanie Lynn Hauser has done a great job with it in this first novel. The book appeals both because of its clever allusions to superhero legend and the Marvel and DC comic universes (Birdie's son/sidekick is named Stanley Lee; the National Enquirer photographer who stalks her is Jimmy Nelson [sic]), and because Hauser fits the extraordinary things that happen to Birdie into a framework so normal (housework, PTA meetings, truculent teenagers) that they are rendered entirely credible. (Or mostly credible: Birdie should never have used her own recognizable, traceable automobile for her superhero runs.) Super Mom's story will appeal to the suburban mother set, all of us who share with Birdie both the responsibilities of motherhood and its attendant sadness--the knowledge that our babies will grow up.

The females of the foursome, Alice and Amanda, were acquainted with one another pre-pregnancy: their mutual animosity sets the tone in turn for their husband's dislike of one another.<br /><br />Former career-woman Alice, impregnated by and quickly wed to her one-afternoon-stand Jake, is a likeable, accomplished woman, but she suppresses her own interests and personality to live up to her handsome new husband's demanding expectations: Jake is an extreme environmentalist who goes to absurd lengths to minimize his family's impact on the environment, using colanders salvaged from the dump as lampshades, for example, and (unrealistically, I should think) refashioning the metal from spiral notebooks into coat hangers. His plans for Alice's upcoming childbirth--to be endured without benefit of anesthesia, of course--approach the barbaric. Amanda, on the other hand, roughly Jake's opposite on the eco-conscious spectrum, is a self-absorbed careerist for whom family is hardly a priority: she plans to use her baby as a fashion accessory, and to use her husband Hugo as the baby's primary caregiver. Amanda has carefully plotted out her own childbirth, from scheduled elective cesarean to live-in maternity nurse. But all laid plans being, as we know, subject to fickle fortune, neither Jake's nor Amanda's visions of their birth experiences quite work out. Nor do their respective marriages thrive in the sleep-deprived months to follow, when disagreements over the division of labor in their households inevitably arise.<br /><br />The Wives of Bath is a diverting romantic comedy that hits a few new-parenthood nails squarely on the head. The book can boast of some nice writing, and it is for the most part carefully plotted. The problem is that the characters of Jake and Amanda are far too over-the-top to be credible, the near-abusive Jake nothing more than the caricature of an eco-fanatic, while Amanda is, as the author puts it, the personification of a \\"baby-hating career bitch.\\" (\\"What do I care about some effing celebrity kids?\\" she spits at Alice. \\"Or any kids, come to that? Kids, schmids. Anyone who has them deserves all they've got coming to them.\\") No one short of Cruella de Ville is this unabashedly nasty. One can also fault the book for the deus ex machina that arrives at the book's end to resolve the problems between Jake and Alice.<br /><br />The Wives of Bath is far from perfect, but if you're looking for a light, quick read, you might grab this one.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecenda are far too over-the-top to be credible, the near-abusive Jake nothing more than the caricature of an eco-fanatic, while Amanda is, as the author puts it, the personification of a \\"baby-hating career bitch.\\" (\\"What do I care about some effing celebrity kids?\\" she spits at Alice. \\"Or any kids, come to that?

Dan Tacete, a local dentist and all-around nice guy given to donating his time to treat charity cases, fails to return home one evening after leaving work in his Ford Explorer--the least expensive vehicle in his private fleet. Dan's wife Karen naturally turns for help to her friends Rosco and Belle. While Rosco steals time from his current investigation of a car theft ring to help her, Belle begins to receive a series of crossword puzzles which she suspects may be related to the Tacete case. Certainly the clues in the third puzzle Belle receives seem to refer to one of the primary suspects in Dan's disappearance, the victim's surly business partner Jack Wagner. But Jack isn't alone in attracting the attention of Rosco or his former partner, Newcastle's chief homicide detective Al Lever: among the other suspects in the case are a number of Dan's down-and-out patients, his secretary Bonnie and her wayward brother, and Karen Tacete herself, who is suspiciously hostile to Belle and Rosco after requesting their help and who is unwilling to share everything she knows about the case with the police. Who among these, if any, dunnit? Readers are unlikely to figure that out before the clues--both forensic and linguistic--lead Belle and Rosco to a startling conclusion.<br /><br />As usual in the Nero Blanc series, a handful of crossword puzzles related to the crime punctuate the book--the very puzzles Belle receives in the course of the story--but the six puzzles included in Another Word for Murder are less intimately connected to the solution of the crime than is usual in the series.<br /><br />Another Word for Murder is yet another good read from the husband and wife writing team of Cordelia F. Biddle and Steve Zettler, a.k.a. \\"Nero Blanc.\\" The book's tightly plotted mystery and the surprising twist it offers alone make the book worth the read, and crossword enthusiasts will appreciate the authors' linguistic playfulness and the inclusion of puzzles in the storyline. But I keep coming back to the series for its homey ambiance: the happy, pun-filled relationship of Rosco and Belle themselves, and the clutch of Newcastle denizens who join the couple in holding down a table at Lawson's Coffee Shop every Saturday morning.

In order to set the record straight Hades set to work at once writing his own account of what really happened way back when. Have a Hot Time, Hades! is the first book to result from his labors, the initial installment in his Myth-o-Mania series, which is published pseudonymously, curiously enough, under the name of Kate McMullan.<br /><br />Hades, as it turns out, can write pretty well. Have a Hot Time, Hades! is a charming, irreverent recasting of Greek myth as told from Hades' perspective, from his childhood spent dodging the refuse in his father's stomach (Cronus swallowed all but one of his children in their infancy) to his decision to adopt the Underworld as his realm. In the book we learn of the difficulties the Olympians (i.e., Hades and his siblings) had wresting power from the previous generation of gods. There are battles--well, very violent kickstones matches--with the Titans, some trouble with the monster Typhon, a talking-to from their grandmother Gaia. Nor are the Olympians themselves without their own petty squabbles, mostly arising from Zeus' habit of stealing credit from his siblings and begetting offspring with mortals.<br /><br />Kate McMullan obviously takes liberties with her presentation of the Greek myths in Have a Hot Time, Hades!, but she does a tremendous service in introducing young readers in a highly entertaining way to the major figures in Greek mythology, their familial relationships, and their various areas of interest. (A handy family tree and glossary are included in the book.) The series is off to a great start. Next up is Phone Home, Persephone!, in which Hades will regale us with the true story of his marriage to Persephone.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-06-01

Long-distance stalking had to be annoying.\\"<br /><br />The stalking order thus established (Alan follows Lynn who, though her heart isn't quite in it, follows Roland), the three eccentric principals of Amanda Filipacchi's Love Creeps pursue each other, literally, through the absurdities to follow, exploring many of the possible permutations of their love triangle while falling in and out of desire for one another. What makes the book's plot not only possible but often hilarious is that the stalkers make no attempt to conceal their stalking from their victims or one another: \\"It's always about you, isn't it?\\" one stalker complains to his victim. \\"I just don't understand why you can't pick more fun things to do, out of consideration for us poor stalkers who follow you. I mean, you knew we'd follow you. You know we can't help it. If you were truly considerate, you would consult us as to which activities we could all enjoy.\\"<br /><br />The phenomenon of stalking may not seem like particularly fertile ground for humor, but Filipacchi proves that weird obsession can be drop-dead funny. Her writing is breezy, her characters deliciously flawed. Readers may not long remember the specifics of this romantic comedy's twists and turns, but they're unlikely to forget the amusing image of a trio of love-sick stalkers pursuing one another openly through the streets, swimming pools, and beading classes of New York.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecee drop-dead funny.

They are both unusually intelligent, Petra the sort of quirkily interesting kid whom others in her class consequently label as \\"weird,\\" while Calder excels at patterning. He fidgets incessantly with the set of pentominoes he keeps with him at all times, fitting the Tetris-like shapes together to form rectangles of varying sizes. Both Calder and Petra, too, are unusually receptive to the idea that is a theme of this book, that apparent coincidences are not always coincidental. When the coincidences and various unexplained phenomena in their own lives begin piling up--many of them connected with the painter Vermeer--Calder and Petra come to believe that a particular Vermeer painting will be stolen. When it is, they believe themselves peculiarly suited to finding it.<br /><br />While observing and recording suspicious activity in their own neighborhood, Calder and Petra put their considerable talents to use investigating the theft of the painting and tracking it down. The problem is, it's not intellect alone that they apply to the task: Calder believes that his pentominoes give him hints, while Petra finds herself communicating with the subject of the missing Vermeer painting. Led forward thus by their supernatural helpmates, Calder and Petra make implausible mental leaps that, for this reader at least, make suspension of disbelief impossible.<br /><br />Though its plot is a disappointment, and it never packs any true suspense, Chasing Vermeer has much to recommend it: likeable characters, some nice writing, Brett Helquist's drawings, and the use of codes in the book, based on Calder's pentominoes. The story may also get kids thinking more about art, as the author surely intended. The inclusion of reprints of two of Vermeer's paintings is a nice touch.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecertesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-05-26

Tens of thousands of laborers and craftsmen worked under the eye of the project's master architect, Ustad Isa, for more than a decade. And when the mausoleum's last gleaming white marble slab was fitted into place the world had one of its most treasured monuments, the Taj Mahal.<br /><br />In his marvelous debut novel Beneath a Marble Sky author John Shors has taken what is known of the historical circumstances of the mausoleum's construction and created from that bare-bones account a rich, gripping narrative. The story is told by Princess Jahanara, the wily daughter of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal. At the book's outset she is an old woman, telling her granddaughters the story of her life for the first time: Hindustan is then too dangerous a place for relatives of the reigning emperor, and the girls had been too young previously to be entrusted even with the knowledge that they were of royal blood. The story Jahanara tells is a grand one. Beginning with her childhood among the chattering women of the royal harem, she tells of her mother's strength and intellect and of her parents' devotion to one another, and she introduces readers to her many siblings, in particular two of her brothers, the bookish Dara--the presumptive heir to the throne--and Aurangzeb, whose cruel streak in boyhood would mature into a lust for power and violence that would ultimately threaten not only his family but the empire itself. In the course of her narrative Jahanara tells two love stories--her own and that of her parents--but much of her story is bleak: there is her loveless marriage to the abusive Khondamir, her mother's death, her brother Aurangzeb's instigation of a civil war, her separation from her daughter. She is sustained throughout by her father, her lover, and by two very solid friendships.<br /><br />Most books, however engaging they may be in the reading, ultimately aren't memorable. Over time their plots and characters slip away, and one is left not with a true memory of the book but, at best, with a general sense of one's reaction to it--that it was thrilling or slow, well-written or clumsy, that one would want to read more by the same author or not. But because Beneath a Marble Sky is not only engaging and beautifully written but also tied intimately to a cultural monument, I think that it will live in its readers' imaginations far longer than most books, its story called to mind whenever one encounters references to or pictures of the Taj Mahal. Shors does a service in breathing life into the mausoleum and the historical figures and circumstances that created it. And he's done it beautifully.<br /><br />My one suggestion for improvement is that the author add a historical note to subsequent editions of the book, detailing for readers what is known about the characters whose lives he has depicted.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceengaging they may be in the reading, ultimately aren't memorable.

Fourteen of Hornby's essays are collected here in The Polysyllabic Spree. Each is prefaced by lists of the books the author read and purchased in the month preceding the column's appearance: Hornby, who reads a lot of books and buys even more, is admirably comfortable with populating his shelves with books he is unlikely ever to get to.<br /><br />In his column Hornby discusses what he's read during the month, how he came to read or buy the books he did, how the books under discussion relate to one another. In the course of writing about his reading life Hornby hits on any number of topics: the dampening effect of parenthood on one's reading; his experience watching an unwitting stranger read his book poolside; Anton Chekhov's unfortunate use of sappy endearments--\\"little ginger-haired doggie,\\" \\"my dearest chaffinch\\"--in letters to his wife (\\"For god's sake, pull yourself together, man! You're a major cultural figure!\\"); the surprising similarity between reading and, well, being the leader of the free world:<br /><br />\\"Being a reader is sort of like being president, except reading involves fewer state dinners, usually. You have this agenda you want to get through, but you get distracted by life events, e.g., books arriving in the mail/World War III, and you are temporarily deflected from your chosen path.\\"<br /><br />Hornby's tone in his essays is conversational, his observations often witty. The book is most interesting, inevitably, when Hornby's reading life intersects with one's own, but familiarity with the books he discusses is not necessary to one's enjoyment. (I fear I've read regrettably few of the books on his lists.) One comes away from The Polysyllabic Spree liking Hornby and appreciating his regular-guy take on the highbrow world of letters.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-05-14

His book is divided into five chapters. The fifth is given over primarily to concluding remarks. The third and fourth have to do with the rewards and history of, respectively, audiobooks and reading groups. The meat of Leveen's argument lies in the fifty-odd pages that make up his first two chapters, \\"Uncovering the Books That Will Change Your Life\\" and \\"Seizing More from Your Reading.\\"<br /><br />Leveen argues that readers will gain more from their reading by approaching the business of books systematically. The usual \\"accidental and ad hoc\\" means of selecting titles to read is unfortunate, he believes, because it is more likely to lead to unfulfilling reading experiences that \\"may dampen your enthusiasm, causing your reading to languish, sometimes for long periods.\\" He advocates developing an extensive list of \\"candidates for your attention,\\" that is, a list of books in which one is interested, either because of their subject matter or author or because they were recommended by friends or in reviews. The list is to be organized by subject headings and augmented throughout one's life. As a second step, Leveen suggests that readers acquire a great many of the books on their list. He is fully in favor of possessing a personal library that contains more books than one could possibly read so as to have a wide selection of quality books always at hand. (That sentiment may go some way toward alleviating the guilt of compulsive book buyers over their purchases.)<br /><br />In his second chapter Leveen distills the recommendations of earlier authors on the art of reading and retaining information. He discusses, for example, Mortimer Adler's advice on approaching books as if from a high altitude: one scans a book first to get an idea of its structure, then reads it superficially to pick up its main arguments before sitting down, finally, to a serious analytical reading of the book. Leveen also discusses a variety of note-taking practices.<br /><br />The reading approach Leveen advocates will not be for everyone. His suggestion that readers direct their reading by developing an organized list of book candidates will be of use almost exclusively to those who are interested in pursuing a course of private study through the reading of nonfiction. Readers with less serious goals in mind probably won't find that particular idea--which is, after all, one of the main points of the book--pertinent to their own situation. Leveen should perhaps have made more of this distinction between fiction and nonfiction reading in his text. His cursory look at the subject of engaged reading won't satisfy those who are serious about becoming more active readers themselves. But Leveen provides a great service in introducing his audience to the subject and pointing to books that will provide further information. His quick read will definitely be of interest to the readers on your shopping list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecebefore sitting down, finally, to a serious analytical reading of the book.

He can crank out a passable manuscript faster than most and he's a top-notch speller. He's also involved with something like the perfect woman, Sara, his girlfriend of five years, who is beautiful and plucky and much given to witty banter. Things look even better for Tom when he is hired to ghostwrite the biography of the hugely popular soap star Georgina Nye--the owner of what is reportedly the U.K.'s finest pair of buttocks--a gig which will earn Tom a six-figure commission but buy him a world of trouble: Georgina turns out to be as attracted to Tom as he is to her. Can our hero, as he supposes (\\"Christ--it was hard to see a way in which this couldn't work\\"), keep his relationship with Sara in working order while trysting with a callipygian soap star and dodging the paparazzi?<br /><br />Tom is guided through life and publishing by his agent-cum-mother figure Amy, a hard-drinking piranha of a woman, and by his amusingly death-obsessed editor Hugh. There is also God, who is evidently shorter than one would suppose and who interrupts Tom's first-person narrative from time to time to expound upon His point that romance is illusory and love the stuff of chemical impulses. Tom himself is an awkward, smart character who tends to find himself in absurdly funny circumstances--hiding beneath his dining room table from a pair of pre-tween girls with only an overheated laptop to cover his nakedness, hightailing it across town in desperate need of half a haircut, or merely navigating the difficult waters of getting to an appointment at precisely the right time:<br /><br />\\"What I generally do--and I think this is the only thing you can do if you're an adult who's taken some time to consider all the issues and come up with a clearheaded course of action--is I arrive early, and then hide. I find somewhere close by and conceal myself: wait until I see the person arrive, pause for fifteen seconds, then march in--apologizing profusely for being late. Works every time. Well, except for those times when the person you're meeting happens to walk up behind you while you're crouching watchfully behind a low wall across from the meeting place; if that happens, you're pretty much into 'faking a seizure' territory, really.\\"<br /><br />Like his first novel, Things my Girlfriend and I Have Argued About, Mil Millington's A Certain Chemistry is a smart romp of a book.

Her book is indeed populated in part by the dead, but her corpses are most often mobile beings, difficult to distinguish from the living even for someone with a practiced eye, such as Dunbar's protagonist and narrator Oz. Oz grew up the only living member of a family of corpses, her mother and sister having died before Oz was born, her father perhaps shortly thereafter. It is difficult, in Dunbar's world, to determine precisely when the transition from life to death occurs. The process of dying can be a lengthy one, and besides, corpses tend to retain the characteristics they enjoyed in life: \\"...a southern corpse does not forget her manners just because she is dead, any more than a midwestern one suddenly learns how to carry on a charming conversation about nothing at all.\\"<br /><br />Dunbar's story begins with an appealing mystery: the grave of Oz's childhood neighbor and friend Winfield Evan Stark has been found to be empty, Oz's own published account of her childhood among corpses lying in the grave in its place. This discovery prompts Mr. Stark's relatives to exhume a nearby grave in the hope of finding the missing body, a task over which Oz is for some reason set as overseer. While workmen dig up the grave, Oz writes a continuation of her earlier account, in part as a warning to the rest of us. As Oz discovered in adulthood, her family of corpses was not as unusual as she had supposed. There are corpses everywhere--vacationing in Canada, publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals, meeting with friends at coffee shops--and if you're not careful you may get the life sucked out of you as well.<br /><br />Oz's narrative--Dunbar's novel--is punctuated by keen observations and patches of lovely writing:<br /><br />\\"He was quite thin and I would say he was tall and lean, but you would think of Gary Cooper in High Noon when what I mean is that he was a rather beat-up stick; a long, emaciated collection of bones and skin supporting a large bearded head. Everything about him was that way, even his hair, which was slicked down and lightly grayed, above a long wolfhound face.\\"<br /><br />But Oz's philosophizing slows the narrative down, and neither she nor the characters she describes ever become real enough to make readers care what happens to them. What is maddening about the book, however, is that Dunbar leaves so many questions unanswered: why can people other than Oz see some corpses but not others? how did Stark \\"rescue\\" Oz from her family of corpses, and why did he bother rescuing her subsequently from her perfectly normal foster family? why is her book found in Stark's grave? And so on. This is evidently meant to be a thinking person's book, inspiring in us ideas about the loss of spirit that can precede corporeal death, but the imperfections of the premise around which Dunbar's serious narrative is constructed are too distracting for us to take the book very seriously. An ostensibly absurd premise can be made to work if it is logically consistent, if all the loose ends are tied up, but Dunbar leaves too much unexplained.<br /><br />While My Life with Corpses disappoints, however, Dunbar is clearly a very good prose stylist. There are passages in this book that merit rereading. It will be interesting to see what the author offers us in the future.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceection of bones and skin supporting a large bearded head.

Each of the men, importantly, had had sufficient cash to support a mistress and keep a separate apartment intended for their assignations--a sure sign that the officers had been on the take. Investigating their deaths and the corruption that may have led to the murders is the unhappy task of Detective Espinosa, chief of Rio's 12th district, a somewhat melancholy character who tries vainly to combat the encroaching boredom of his increasingly routine work by walking to and from his apartment by different routes.<br /><br />Given its challenges, Espinosa's latest case provides at least a temporary respite from tedium, particularly when the mistresses of the dead policemen prove to be in peril themselves. Two of the three women are murdered at once, and Espinosa undertakes to protect the third. One woman's death--she falls from a tenth-floor window--is witnessed by a neighbor watching from her apartment across the street, a happenstance which provides the police with one of their few clues and gives author Garcia-Roza his book's title.<br /><br />A Window in Copacabana, translated into English from the original Portuguese, is the fourth book in Garcia-Roza's Detective Espinosa series. The peculiar circumstances of the murders under investigation and the surprising identity of the killer make the novel a good mystery. But what sets the book apart is the mood it sets--the languid air of a city in the tropics--and the philosophical, bibliophilic Espinosa, whose character emerges slowly, without fanfare, as the story progresses. Mystery readers, and anyone enticed by a Copacabana setting, should give the series a look.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-04-19

He moved to Alaska at twenty, eager to escape an abusive father and unwilling to submit to the yoke of a nine-to-five job. For six years Heimo (\\"HI-mow\\") lived alone, trapping and hunting and flying out occasionally with bush pilots to sell his furs. But in 1982 Heimo married Edna, whom he met while walrus hunting on St. Lawrence Island, and she followed her husband to the wilderness. They have lived together since in this desolate place where the sun dips below the horizon in November and isn't seen again until January, where temperatures range from a balmy 80 degrees to 50 below. They and their daughters live a semi-nomadic life, moving each spring from one of their three cabins to another so as not to deplete the animal populations in any one area. Every summer they spend six weeks in Fort Yukon, population 750, stocking up on supplies and getting a small taste of civilization.<br /><br />James Campbell, who happens to be Heimo's cousin, visited the Korths several times beginning in 2002. In telling Heimo's story Campbell juxtaposes descriptions of life in the Arctic--the logistics of carving up a dead moose, the efficient reuse of toilet paper as a firestarter--with stories of Heimo's boyhood in Wisconsin and discussion of the politics of land apportionment in Alaska. The result is a fascinating look at a lifestyle that is impossibly alien yet unexpectedly familiar: Heimo's teenagers tack Britney Spears posters to the walls of their cabin.<br /><br />One begins reading Campbell's account with incredulity, wondering why anyone would choose to live in such an extreme environment and whether the Korths were wise to raise their children there. But reading the fascinating, sometimes heartrending story of Heimo and Edna's life one comes to respect them and their decisions. We are left hoping that Heimo manages to live out his days as he wishes, growing old in a wilderness few men before him have experienced.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceto live out his days as he wishes, growing old in a wilderness few men before him have experienced.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-04-17

Indeed, Max is dedicated to tracking down cyber-criminals, the nefarious disseminators of computer viruses, which he does with the aid of an impressive array of high-tech gadgetry. The Robin to Max's Batman is Mr. Z, a similarly precocious eight-year-old who eschews age-appropriate play and views the world with the cynical eye of a noir detective. Like any hero worthy of the name, Max is saddled with a nemesis, in his case an enemy from his Berkeley days, the delightfully over-the-top Xefland Aurcracker. Aurcracker is the filthy-rich, computer-challenged CEO of a company that produces virus protection software. Aurcracker intends, with the assistance of a minion or two, to release a devastating computer virus, frame Max for the crime, and rake in piles of cash by selling the only software capable of defeating it. At the same time, Aurcracker means to break Max's heart by stealing away the girl he's just met and fallen for (principally because she is nearly as fond of her iBook as he is of his own numerous computers).<br /><br />Max Mooth--Cyber Sleuth is not a perfect book. Max punctuates his speech with corny computerisms--\\"Feeling downloadable, punk?\\"--that grow tiresome. Occasional scenes don't work because they strain credibility: climbing a muddy hill, Max is beset by an unlikely number of worms; he extricates himself from difficult situations with the homemade screwdriver he carries around, which he fashioned, inexplicably, out of paper clips. Max lives in a retirement home, having been raised there by a now deceased grandmother. This is interesting in that it adds a further layer to Max's hesitant relationship with adulthood--the boy/man is more comfortable with children and the elderly than with his own age group. But the implausibility of the arrangement is distracting.<br /><br />These shortcomings, however, are relatively minor, and they pale in comparison with what the book has to offer: a cast of delightfully quirky characters and some genuinely amusing dialogue and situations. For example, Aurcracker assembles a team of psychiatrists to ask them how best to steal Max's girlfriend from him. \\"I'm pursuing a woman,\\" he says to them, \\"mainly to deny a nemesis from having her by completely lying, deceiving and pulling the wool over her eyes. Any ideas how I should proceed?\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, Max, having blocked the door to a certain Mr. Underwood's office with a chair, frantically searches the room and Underwood's computer while its owner is away:<br /><br />\\"Just then, the door hit the chair, blocking it. Max jumped, and quickly turned off Underwood's computer. He dove over the desk, back in his chair, as Underwood pushed his way in. Max appeared bored, leafing through his briefcase.<br /><br />\\"'What was a chair doing there?' Underwood asked suspiciously.<br /><br />\\"'I don't know,' Max said. 'Must've fallen when you left.

The responses Hill and Power received form the backbone of their book, in which interview snippets are arranged thematically and interspersed with explanatory or introductory narrative. The book's eighteen chapters are divided into three broad sections--The Bestseller, Publishing, and The Author. The topics covered are too numerous to mention here, but the authors have included discussions of, for example, the various best-selling lists and how they are compiled; the importance--or not--of print reviews to a book's success; the influence of agents and editors on a manuscript; how booksellers select the titles they stock; and the process of adapting bestsellers for the screen.<br /><br />The Making of a Bestseller is well written and clearly organized, and it is chock full of information about how the publishing industry works. Its authors, in interviewing so many subjects from throughout the publishing world, show readers a cross-section of the industry with its various strata, from author to bookseller, laid bare. The book should be of interest to would-be authors looking to scale the heights of bestsellerdom themselves as well as to industry insiders. Fans of the authors interviewed--among them Dan Brown, Peter Straub, Barbara Taylor Bradford, and Nicholas Sparks--may also be interested in this behind-the-scenes look at their favorite books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-04-05

Simon's host and the clutch of other writers at the conference know him as the author of two highly respected biographies, but Simon also publishes novels pseudonymously, including a bestselling series of mysteries under the name Dorinda Darlington. The fun starts when a woman claiming to be Dorinda shows up at the conference and sets about infuriating her \\"colleagues.\\" A corpse or two later, Simon is back to putting his vampiric attributes--acute hearing, the ability to sense when people are lying--to good use, helping the local constabulary solve a double murder.<br /><br />The toothsome Watson to Simon's toothy Sherlock is Sir Giles Blitherington, the young lord Simon hired as an assistant in the first Kirby-Jones mystery, shortly after he moved to the quaint village of Snupperton Mumsley. In Faked to Death Simon is still warding off Giles' incessant but not wholly unwelcome advances. He is also still remembering to take twice daily the pills that, in this modern age, allow vampires to live like mortals, gadding about in the sunlight and eschewing the drinking of blood.<br /><br />Perhaps perversely, I'm hoping Simon will forget his medication one day: I'd like to see how the polite society of Snupperton Mumsley would react should Simon start showing his fangs. I'm also hoping Dean Jones will continue chronicling Simon's exploits for a long time to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-03-27

Greenlaw's lunch date there with her mentor and friend of 25 years, Alden Leeman, provides the framework for the series of stories she shares with readers--the very stories, or so the author alleges (though the book's title may give one pause)--that she and Alden and hangers on at their table swapped that day at the Dry Dock over a very extended luncheon.<br /><br />The stories Greenlaw includes in the book are a mixed bunch--rough seas and unlikely survivals, noisome deck hands and shiv-wielding mates, a refrigerated dead guy. Many of the stories are stirring; the rest are at least good reads. Greenlaw writes nicely, and her characterization of her friend Alden--for whom her affection is palpable--is well done: \\"I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and waited for Alden to think about what he might like to drink. I knew that he would eventually order a rum and Coke, but he did not know this. He never did.\\"<br /><br />It is not necessary to know anything whatever about fishing or sailing to enjoy All Fishermen are Liars. Nautical types will surely want to view their world through Greenlaw's lens, but landlubbers like myself will appreciate the author's readable introduction to an unfamiliar world. She and her gang of mendacious fishing buddies make for good company for the book's duration.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-03-20

Lachlan begins the diary on the day his wife is convicted of murdering Andrew Gow, a serial killer with whom she had worked closely in her capacity as his court-appointed psychologist. Lachlan's diary is in part a record of his attempt to uncover the truth behind Gow's murder--he cannot believe his wife is guilty. It includes his transcriptions of the newspaper accounts and other documents pertaining to the case that his wife had squirreled away in her private--padlocked--study. At the same time the diary records Lachlan's attempts to cope with normal life in the months following his wife's conviction--the mothers at his daughter's day care center conspicuously friendly, an \\"elderly triumvirate\\" of relatives making a show of their support by coming to stay with him--uninvited, unwelcome, and ultimately unhelpful. (Lachlan is kicked out of his bathroom one evening by Susie's aunt, who cannot find the other bathrooms in his house. \\"It is not without a frisson of compensatory pleasure that I stood on the landing, holding my limp newspaper, and watched her lock herself in with the rank stench of my lower intestines.\\")<br /><br />In the course of the period covered by his diary, Lachlan eventually comes to understand the riddle of Gow's murder and of his wife's strange, secretive behavior. It is a mystery that will keep readers engrossed and guessing until the book's final pages. Mina's Deception is a smart, well-written thriller.

US	52923654	RI6G3BJ2PAM5I	0974223344	501503210	Eloquent Blood	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A book with potential	When a graduate student and a border collie turn up dead in the office of one of Midfield College's English professors, Visiting Professor Mary Beth Goldberg finds something better to do with her time than grading papers. She and her bike-repairing, Bartlett's Quotations-quoting fianc&eacute; Tony turn into amateur sleuths to track down a killer among the pompous academics in her department. As it turns out, a number of her colleagues would probably jump at the chance to kill their department chairman, but none of them has an obvious motive for wanting the victim dead.<br /><br />My reaction to Eloquent Blood was decidedly mixed. On the one hand, I very much like the credible academic environment that the author, an academic herself, has created. Her protagonist, Mary Beth Goldberg, is likeable enough, and as a newly arrived member of Midfield College she could be made to have an interesting outsider's perspective of the College and the small town of Midfield, Ohio. There are occasional well-put turns of phrase. (\\"You could see that she had been a keen, maybe peachy, young woman with a keen, maybe peachy, hair-do twenty years ago, and she had seen no reason to change it.\\") And the mystery behind the murders is a decent one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a number of problems with the text as it stands that will prevent readers from fully enjoying the story. There are occasional logical problems. (At the very beginning of the book, for example Tony discovers the dead bodies and calls Mary Beth to tell her about the murders while en route to visiting her. But she's only two office doors down from the scene of the crime. No one would make a phone call in such a circumstance.) The dialogue can be awkward. (\\"You're right, Mary-Babe, and I know you'll hate me for being corny at a time like this, but there would be something so fitting in yon literary prof giving voice to that line from Macbeth, 'Out damned Spot! Out, I say!'\\") There is a dramatic, unprepared for shift in point of view in the middle of chapter eight. What is consistently troubling, however, is that Mary Beth, who has only been teaching at Midfield College for some two months and who is new to the community, is treated as if she has a long history in the area. She is surrounded by very close friends she can have only just met. She is credited with a more intimate knowledge of the campus and its history and denizens than she should have after so brief an acquaintance with them.<br /><br />With more work, Eloquent Murder could be the start of a solid series of academic cozies.

When they're not belting out a lusty sea shanty or arguing about the best way to prepare ham, there's nothing pirates like more than a rousing adventure. Happily, that's just what's in store for the Pirate Captain and his shipful of variously monikered pirates--the scarf-wearing pirate, the pirate with an accordion, the ill-fated balding archeologist pirate--when they bump into Charles Darwin and his trained monkey Mr. Bobo in the South Pacific. Together, Darwin and the pirates sail off to England to combat the Bishop of Oxford, an evil-mustachioed villain with a diabolical scheme involving the grisly murder of numerous circus-going women. The Pirate Captain may be an unusually gullible scofflaw, and--how to put this nicely--he's not the sharpest cutlass in the drawer, but his peculiar combination of hirsute manliness, keen introspection (\\"Damn my piratical nature!\\"), and roguish je ne sais quoi may be just the thing needed to defeat the Oxfordian knave.<br /><br />Gideon Defoe's exuberant The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists purports to be an account set down some 150 years ago by the debonair Pirate Captain himself--so the Captain's note to readers (specifically, negligee-clad, nineteen-year-old readers) on the back of the book alleges. (Careful readers may doubt the account's historicity, though, given its frequent anachronisms--references to Murder, She Wrote, for example, and Cocoa Puffs. I'll leave it to readers to nitpick.) It comes complete with the occasional footnote, some of the entries very odd indeed: \\"Black looks best on persons who have black in their features (hair, eyes, brows, and lashes), although black can be worn by most people for very dramatic occasions.\\" There is also a handful of helpful questions for discussion in the back of the book. (For example, number seven: \\"Scientifically speaking, who do you think the tallest pirate in the world is?\\")<br /><br />If it's not clear enough by now, Defoe's Pirates is a hilarious read filled with some extremely clever writing. Not for nothing has Monty Python's Eric Idle blurbed it as \\"destined to become a classic of pirate comic fiction.\\" You'll want to read this one.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecesome extremely clever writing.

US	52923654	RC6LRHSVTI8RB	0525947949	61603527	Good News, Bad News	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Initially exquisite	The first chapter of David Wolstencroft's Good News, Bad News promises great things: two unnamed men flip a coin--the first indication that the book's plot will hang on the vicissitudes of chance--to determine which of them is going to die. Surprisingly, the loser of the toss does not seem unduly put out by the result. In chapter two we are introduced to Wolstencroft's two main characters, Charlie, the younger of the two, and George, \\"a baked potato of a man\\" given to spouting the plots of locked room mysteries at odd moments. Both men are relatively new employees of a photo lab situated in the \\"troglodyte empire\\" of the London Underground. Charlie, at least, is convinced that one of their regular customers, a gorgeous woman whose photographs suggest she trots the globe at breakneck pace, is a spy. The two men bicker regularly over the implications of her suspicious photography.<br /><br />The opening chapters of Good News, Bad News are very good indeed, suspenseful, well-written, and humorous. (I was sold on the book after the first half page.) The interaction between Charlie and George is especially good, Charlie attempting in vain to ignore the older man's \\"endless and near-psychotic amiability.\\" In the course of the novel Charlie and George come to discover that they have more in common than they--or we--had supposed, including, in particular, that both are interested in quitting their jobs.<br /><br />But while Wolstencroft's novel starts extremely well, it does not quite live up to the promise of its introduction. As Charlie and George's situation becomes more dire, the humor of their early intercourse is dropped. And while there are patches of exquisite prose early on in the book, the writing becomes less noticeably good--if never bad--later on. Nor will readers be glued to their seats awaiting the book's outcome. It is certainly a good enough book to continue with, but it does not build the sort of suspense that keeps one up reading late into the night.<br /><br />Despite these reservations, Good News, Bad News comes recommended. Wolstencroft (he is the writer and creator of the spy drama MI-5, which airs on A&E) is clearly a writer to watch.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece><br />Despite these reservations, Good News, Bad News comes recommended.

Ellie's attempts to understand the deceased's interest in her, beginning with a meeting with the dead man's landlady, lead her into a much larger mystery: Sinclair's death is somehow connected with Nazi-era intrigue and Chicago politics, an illicit love affair, and more than one murder. While tracing Sinclair's steps on her own time, Ellie is hired to produce a campaign film for a senatorial candidate, the scion of a long-dead Chicago steel magnate, who may have skeletons of her own to conceal. Ellie's work on the campaign dovetails neatly into her private investigations, and she finds herself in increasingly hot water the closer she gets to the truth Sinclair had been trying to unravel before his death.<br /><br />Libby Hellmann's An Eye for Murder is the first in a series of mysteries featuring filmmaker Ellie Foreman. It's a good read with a rather complex plot that, however, can become confusing if one isn't paying strict attention. In Ellie Hellmann has created a likable protagonist with an interesting circle of friends and family: Ellie, the divorced mother of a twelve-year-old daughter, has a fiscally irresponsible ex-husband, an unusually but charmingly devoted gardener, a cigar-smoking character of a father, and, as we see blooming in this first book in the series, a love interest in the person of fifty-something David Linden. Hellmann saddles Ellie with some unfortunate vices: she has a history of kleptomania, and it is hinted that she makes occasional use of drugs (not to mention alcohol and tobacco). In future installments these imperfections may serve to round out her character, but in the present book they seemed tacked on rather than organic. I will be interested to read future books in the series to see how Ellie develops, and how her ostensibly safe career as a documentarian involves her in new difficulties.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecestensibly safe career as a documentarian involves her in new difficulties.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-02-16

Sarah, in her college days a short-haired feminist flirting with lesbianism, is married to an older man, Richard, who failed as a father and husband in his first marriage and is repeating his mistakes in a second. Sarah, though not a bad mother to her three-year-old daughter Lucy, is not fully comfortable with, or competent at, the task of caring for a child. Todd, on the other hand, a square-jawed former athlete whom the other mothers at the playground have dubbed the Prom King, thoroughly enjoys his role as stay-at-home dad. What plagues him is his failure to pass the bar exam, his failure to want to pass it, and his wife's relentless attempts to push him into a career for which he is unsuited. Sarah and Todd meet near the swings, enact a dramatic if unlikely scene for their audience of busybody playground parents, and fall into an affair which they hope will make their lives right. The drama of their relationship and its complications is supplemented by trouble in their town, the arrival of a convicted child molester, who has moved in with his mother after a stint in jail and has his own more extreme problems forming relationships.<br /><br />Perrotta's novel is about choices--the mate one selects, the children one chooses, or not, to have, the life that results from the small decisions one makes along the way. And it is about relationships, usually dysfunctional romantic relationships, unexpectedly supportive same-sex groups that play or read or pass out flyers together, ties between parents and children. The book is not always successful. The hierarchy of playground mothers, the less powerful personalities under the sway of a spandex-clad, fascistic, supermom, does not ring true. And the children's dialogue, what little there is of it, sounds to my ears more like an adult affecting childish speech than realistic three-year-old language: \\"Where it went? ...Where my snack?\\" But sometimes Perrotta gets it just right, as in his description of Todd's contentment with full-time fatherhood:<br /><br />\\"Something had happened to him over the past couple of years, something to do with being home with Aaron, sinking into the rhythm of a kid's day. The little tasks, the small pleasures. The repetition that goes beyond boredom and becomes a kind of peace. You do it long enough, and the adult world starts to drift away. You can't catch up with it, not even if you try.\\"<br /><br />Little Children builds in suspense as Todd and Sarah's relationship consumes them and as the child molester's demons threaten to overpower him. One fears for the children of the book's title, not so much because of the threat posed by the sex offender in their midst, but because of the harm their own parents' bad decisions may cause.

Orlean explains that the essays she chose for the book are connected in that the sense of place in them is especially important: \\"When I wrote these pieces, the sense of where I was--of where the stories were unfolding--seemed to saturate every element of the experience, to inform it and shape it, and to be what made the story whole.\\" In some cases the importance of location to an essay will be apparent to the reader, as for example Orlean's piece on the student president of Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan (\\"Madame President\\"). But in other cases the reasons for the author's inclusion of an essay are not apparent. Readers, at any rate, are unlikely to care whether the essays are connected to one another by a meaningful theme. Orlean divides her book into three sections: \\"Here\\" includes essays set in the United States; those set abroad--from Cuba to Hungary to Thailand--are included in \\"There\\"; and \\"Elsewhere\\" is a hodgepodge of mostly short (some as brief as two pages), mostly whimsical essays set in any number of places.<br /><br />Orlean's modus operandi is to observe her subject for a length of time--spending a week or two, say, walking the aisles of an independently owned grocery store in Jackson Heights, New York, interviewing its managers and employees, watching the parade of hair-netted housewives and pierced teenagers and hand truck-pushing delivery men who flow in and out of the store (\\"All Mixed Up\\"). And then she writes about the experience in plain prose, and through the accumulation of ostensibly mundane details--sometimes, truth be told, a few too many mundane details--she brings her chosen slice of society alive for readers. Sometimes Orlean is introducing us to unfamiliar terrain, to the resting stations that punctuate a climb up Japan's Mt. Fuji, for example. But Orlean's essays are no less interesting--are indeed often more interesting--when she focuses on the familiar: among my favorite essays in this collection is \\"We Just Up and Left,\\" the author's description of a trailer park in Portland, Oregon, the sort of place one can drive by for years without noticing.<br /><br />Other noteworthy pieces in My Kind of Place are \\"Royalty,\\" detailing the author's investigation into the curious abundance of royally-named papaya stores in Manhattan (Papaya King, Papaya Prince, Papaya Kingdom); \\"Art for Everybody,\\" a look inside a Thomas Kinkade (the Painter of Light!) Signature Gallery; and \\"The Congo Sound,\\" an essay about an African music store in Paris, France.<br /><br />Fans of Orlean's will find more morsels to savor here. Readers who have not read Orlean previously can start here or might, better yet, read the work for which she is best known: her book The Orchid Thief is itself very much about a place--Florida--as well as the orchidophiles who populate it. Just don't expect the book to resemble its fanciful film adaptation, Adaptation, wherein Orlean, played by Meryl Streep, is depicted as a drug-addicted murderess.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceo less interesting--are indeed often more interesting--when she focuses on the familiar: among my favorite essays in this collection is \\"We Just Up and Left,\\" the author's description of a trailer park in Portland, Oregon, the sort of place one can drive by for years without noticing.<br /><br />Other noteworthy pieces in My Kind of Place are \\"Royalty,\\" detailing the author's investigation into the curious abundance of royally-named papaya stores in Manhattan (Papaya King, Papaya Prince, Papaya Kingdom); \\"Art for Everybody,\\" a look inside a Thomas Kinkade (the Painter of Light!)

The drug is an antiviral agent, a potential antidote for the deadly Madoba-2 virus, and its disappearance suggests that the virus itself, kept in storage under the tightest possible security at the small pharmaceuticals firm, may have gotten out of the lab. In the next 72 hours Toni will find that the situation is far worse than she initially supposed: the security system at Oxenford has been breached by the one person capable of defeating its safeguards, someone who now has access to a highly infectious, easily released disease with a survival rate of zero. Throw into the mix an uncooperative police superintendent and an unexpected blizzard, and Toni may not be able to stop the bad guys from unleashing a plague with unprecedented killing power.<br /><br />We've seen this sort of book from Ken Follett before: a highly competent heroine battles an amoral--or at least insufficiently moral--antagonist while overcoming obstacles thrown at her by a difficult former lover. The story is told from multiple perspectives, and the heroine's ultimate victory over her nemesis is never really in doubt. But if the general outline of Follett's plot is familiar, so too is the author's skillful build-up of page-turning suspense. Follett never fails to fashion characters one wants to root for, and he is adept at keeping the good guys forever in the thick of some horrific danger. Whiteout, like its predecessors in the author's shelf-full of bestsellers, is a great read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-01-30

Dry rot has forced a temporary evacuation of her home and office, a rented houseboat moored on the east shore of Washington's Lake Union, and from her interim quarters she is overseeing the final preparations for two end-of-year nuptials. Preparations for the Buckmeister/Frost Christmas Eve wedding aren't unusually problematic, but the blowout Carnegie's planning for New Year's Eve proves to be a trial. For one thing, bride-to-be Sally Tyler--the daughter of renowned conductor Charles Tyler and his superstar CEO wife Ivy--is a spoiled rich girl with the people skills to match. For another, the groom's disagreeable best man turns up dead the morning after the bachelor party, and Carnegie--spying on the debauch for her own reasons through a pair of binoculars--may have witnessed the prelude to his murder.<br /><br />May the Best Man Die is the third book in Deborah Donnelly's series of Wedding Planner Mysteries.

It's a tightly-plotted mystery with a likable protagonist and good, breezy writing: \\"So, roundly cursing Ms. Tyler and the stack of wedding magazines she rode in on, I climbed into my van [the Vanna White Too, by the way] and drove south.\\" Readers looking for a quick, well-written cozy will find Donnelly's series delightful.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-01-21

Northern Ireland at the time is riven by political and religious differences, and the Troubles form a backdrop to Gabriel's childhood and adolescence. But the more immediate cause of Gabriel's unhappiness during these years is his homosexuality. Bullied for his effeminacy, tormented by guilt when he gives way to what the Church tells him are sinful urges, Gabriel worries too that he is a disappointment to his father, who appears to favor Gabriel's athletic and mechanically-inclined brother James. Gabriel cannot confess his desires, not even to his beloved uncle, Father Brendan, but he does come to realize that his sexual proclivity is not the only secret being harbored in the Harkin family: some disgrace which his parents refuse to discuss evidently lies behind Brendan's entrance into the priesthood.<br /><br />Damian McNicholl's A Son Called Gabriel is written in the first person and reads like a memoir. As such it will inevitably be compared to Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. Remarkably, McNicholl's novel does not suffer from the comparison. It is so well written, and the author's portrayal of Gabriel is so vivid, that readers will be hard-pressed to remember they're holding a piece of fiction in their hands. A Son Called Gabriel creates a fully realistic community--Gabriel's parents and siblings and extended family of aunts and uncles and grandparents, the boys who taunt or befriend him at school--and a likable main character with whom readers cannot but sympathize as they watch him grow to manhood. It is a perfect novel. And, quiet story though it is, the book packs a wallop in its final pages when the secret of Brendan's retreat into the clergy is finally revealed.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-01-19

Charles wiles away his days in apparent indolence and drunkenness, mourning a love affair gone sour, watching Gene Tierney movies into the night, overseeing the construction of a folly on the property. But to Charles's mind his purpose in life is a serious one: he means to revive \\"the contemplative life of the country gentleman, in harmony with his status and history.\\" For the first third of An Evening of Long Goodbyes Charles is thus an amusing anachronism, a Wodehousian character thrust into a less polite modern world. This makes for some wickedly funny writing, both in dialogue and narrative. (Out to a seedy pub with Bel and her Golem of a boyfriend Frank, Charles looks around with some unease at his fellow drinkers. \\"Was I the only one in evening wear?\\") But one senses that Charles's retreat from society is motivated by an underlying sadness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Charles's idyllic lifestyle cannot last. Events conspire to push him out of Amaurot and into productive society, where he engages in activities--paying work, for example--that were previously unthinkable. Charles grows as a human being, developing empathy, for example, and he is eventually compelled to confront the imperfections of his childhood at Amaurot, which he had long glorified.<br /><br />While Charles's development is interesting to watch, he becomes a less interesting character as he changes from a wry commentator on a society that is alien to him to a productive participant in that society. The book, too, loses charm as it moves from the farce of its early pages to the melodrama of Charles's post-Amaurot life. Still worth reading, a lighter book that kept Charles in tails and gimlets would surely have garnered five stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecef a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2005-01-15

Rowland, an aspiring novelist, teaches the school's nine students creative writing, while Nina-whose fondest desire, strangely enough, is to be married to a scholar-instructs them in etiquette. (\\"There's no need to jump to your feet if one of your friend's parents comes into the room, far less your own. It looks too well trained.\\") Problems develop during the year described in Muriel Sparks' The Finishing School when Rowland conceives a powerful jealousy of 17-year-old student Chris Wiley. Chris is at the school to work on his own book, a historical novel about the murder of Lord Darnley, husband of Mary Queen of Scots, that takes jealousy as its theme. Chris manages to interest publishers and film producers in his unfinished manuscript with unlikely and, for Rowland, maddening ease. With Rowland's marriage suffering as a result of his obsession with Chris and with Chris himself showing signs of instability, with several of the book's characters announcing that the situation is ripe for murder, the end of the school year holds the promise of high drama.<br /><br />Not that high drama is in fact delivered. Nor will readers care very much how the year wraps up for the College Sunrise students and faculty, for we never come to know the characters of Sparks' short book. Most are one-dimensional creatures whose names one needn't bother remembering from one page to the next. The two characters whose emotions are explored in the book-Rowland and Chris-are only slightly more fleshed out. Throughout, Sparks keeps readers at an emotional distance, \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing,\\" the reverse of the old saw about writing: \\"Nina now perceived that Rowland's jealousy was an obsession.\\" Sparks' prose, sometimes stilted, fails to charm. (\\"The Sunrise group comprised eight, the ninth, Princess Tilly, having a pain in her stomach and so forced to lie on a sofa for some hours, on this her bad day of the month.\\") When the end comes-an abrupt section in which the characters' fates are revealed &agrave; la the film Animal House-one feels that one has read the literary equivalent of empty calories.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecesofa for some hours, on this her bad day of the month.\\") When the end comes-an abrupt section in which the characters' fates are revealed &agrave; la the film Animal House-one feels that one has read the literary equivalent of empty calories.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-12-31

His drunken sexual encounter with a 40-something \\"nice Valkyrie-type called Helga\\" leaves him walletless and plagued, for months thereafter, by his own stupidity: his \\"Helga\\" is in fact a certain Heidi Delsminka, wanted throughout Australia for credit card fraud and armed robbery. Over the next year, while struggling in his job, eating poorly, and vaguely looking for sex, Rick chronicles the problems that ensue from his interlude with Heidi in daily entries in his diary. At the same time he details for readers the minutiae of his life: his argument with a fast food place over the availability of Diet Coke in bottles in the restaurant; evidence that his roommate George may be having sex with chickens on the sly; his vague efforts to determine the identity of the \\"phantom pant scrubber,\\" someone who spends an inordinate amount of time in the men's bathroom at work apparently scrubbing his underwear with steel wool. (\\"What the hell is wrong with his arse?\\" Rick writes.) There is much crude talk of bowel movements and their ilk in the book and a fair number of post-Heidi drunken interludes that do not, however, end with Rick pantsless and broke. Rick also includes in his diary the text of the articles he writes for the paper, with increasing competence, on usually uninteresting small-town issues.<br /><br />Journo's Diary, as its name suggests, is written in the form of a diary, and the book stops when the pages in Rick's diary run out. The book is chapterless, but its organization into journal entries segment it into bite-sized chunks. The book itself is a quick and sometimes funny read, though its pace is slowed by the inclusion of the text of Rick's newspaper articles. These do contribute to our understanding of Rick's life as a disillusioned first-year journalist, but they are not interesting of themselves. Detailing as it does a twenty-something lifestyle--Rick's life is at least more raucous than mine has ever been (though that's not saying much)--Journo's Diary will appeal in particular to the younger crowd, and to anyone who's ever worked as a journalist.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceare not interesting of themselves.

US	52923654	R3OHX8WM2OWFFX	0765306476	517445682	Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A life lived with Frank Herbert	The author Frank Herbert (1920-1985) is best known for his wildly popular novel Dune, winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1965 and arguably the best science fiction novel ever written. In his biography Dreamer of Dune, Frank Herbert's son Brian tells us the story behind the desert planet of his father's imagination, breathing life into the brilliant but imperfect character of the bearish man who so dominated his own life. In straightforward, no-frills prose, Brian Herbert tells the story of his father's life chronologically and in great detail, from Frank's dangerously independent childhood in the Pacific northwest--at the age of nine he sailed on his own in a row boat from his home town of Burley, Washington to the San Juan islands and back, a distance of more than two hundred miles--to his sudden death at the age of 65 from a pulmonary embolism. Along the way Herbert's life was dominated by two focuses, his writing--he was a prolific author who wrote with a feverish intensity and demanded that his time at the typewriter remain inviolate--and his wife: Beverly Herbert, Brian's mother, was Frank's partner in life and in the business of writing for nearly forty years, theirs the sort of marriage that grew in intensity over time and which seems to have been a stronger bond than either shared with their children. Beverly predeceased her husband by slightly more than two years. (Frank's devotion to Beverly is perhaps called into question by the fact that he was married again so soon after her death, to a woman thirty-six years his junior. He pronounced himself \\"in love\\" with this young woman less than three months after his wife's death.)<br /><br />The picture Brian paints of his father is not wholly flattering. Frank Herbert was a larger-than-life personality, the benevolent and booming host of dinner parties, a witty raconteur. He was a doting husband and a loyal friend. A man filled with curiosity and energy, Herbert was always planning new projects--literary, ecological, architectural. Prior to his death he was planning on becoming the oldest man to climb Mt. Everest. But his personality had a less attractive side, the ego and arrogance that came with his genius. Brian Herbert writes of his father: \\"He dominated every conversation, even when a room was full of people, and sometimes I found his ego hard to bear. But that was his way, and he was, after all, the most interesting person any of us knew.\\"  Herbert demanded that others bend to his writing schedule to an unreasonable degree; he required a surprising degree of assistance, of gophering, from Brian in his adulthood, and he became wroth when his directions were not followed to the letter. Most importantly, although he made up for it to an extent in later years, Frank was a lousy father, impatient with his children (and, years hence, with his grandchildren), whose noise threatened to interrupt his work. He was a strict disciplinarian who hooked his sons up to a lie detector he'd procured and sweated the truth of their peccadilloes out of them. Brian and his brother Bruce--we hear very little about the latter in the book--were both estranged from their father at various points in their lives, though Brian became very close to Frank in his adulthood.<br /><br />Weighing in at more than 500 pages, Dreamer of Dune is a long slog of a book which would have benefited from energetic editing. Part of the problem is that material is sometimes repeated. We are told three times, for example, that the Herberts may be descended from Henry VIII. The worse problem is that the book is overflowing with insignificant details, as if the author were attempting to include in the biography the text of every journal entry he ever made and every last bit of family lore he could lay his hands on. These tidbits are strewn about the book in passages that could readily have been cut from their surroundings. Thus, for example, we are told early in the book about Frank Herbert's dental hygiene:<br/><br />\\"From an early age Frank Herbert was fastidious about his teeth, spending as much as fifteen minutes at a time brushing them. In his entire lifetime he never had one cavity, and his teeth were so perfect that dentists marveled upon seeing them.\\"<br /><br />And later on we hear about the character of a yawn Frank Herbert yawned at about ten o'clock on a Saturday in July of 1980:<br /><br />\\"Just before ten o'clock Dad bid us good night at his usual time, so that he could rise early the next morning and write. He kissed Mom and whispered something in her ear, which caused her to smile. As he shuffled off to bed he yawned, simultaneously making a drawn-out, mid-range tone that was punctuated with a high pitched 'yow' at the end. He entered the master bedroom and closed the door behind him.\\"<br /><br />It is remarkable that that \\"yow\\" business made it into Brian Herbert's journal, let alone into his published biography of his father.<br /><br />On a second discussion of the Herbert teeth, we hear also of Frank's difficulty sleeping one night in August of 1981:<br /><br />\\"I recall seeing him in our bathroom in boxer shorts one morning, flossing his teeth. He had always taken care of his teeth. They were perfect, without a cavity. He said he didn't sleep well the night before, and that when he drifted off he snored more than usual, and it kept waking him up. His back was bothering him a little, too, though he propped a big pillow under the head of the mattress as he normally did. We offered him some aspirin for the pain, but he said he was all right.\\"<br /><br />Banal as these details are, they do serve to paint for persevering readers a very intimate and surprisingly moving picture of a life lived in Frank Herbert's circle. After this 500-odd-page entr&eacute;e into his father's family life, one cannot be left unmoved by Brian Herbert's loving account of his parents' relationship, of the tragedy of his mother's lingering illness and death, of Frank Herbert's singular devotion to his wife.

The daughter of a costermonger, Maisie went into service in 1910, at the age of thirteen, in the home of a woman who would become her benefactress. Maisie was tutored by a friend of her employer's, a Yoda-like character who spouted Eastern wisdom and taught his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e a sort of holistic approach to detection. Later, after a brief stint at Cambridge, Maisie served as a nurse in the blood and muck of France and was courted by a charming doctor with whom she had danced once in England prior to shipping out. When the book's narrative returns to Maisie's present what we now know of her past renders her experiences in 1929 more poignant.<br /><br />Maisie Dobbs is a nicely written book and a gentle read, despite its subject matter. In large part the book is successful, though Maisie's apparent ability to understand the emotions of others by adopting their posture strains credibility. The character of Maisie's tutor too, the seemingly omniscient Maurice Blanche, does not quite come to life. More literary than genre fiction--if one is to categorize the book by those unspecific terms--Maisie Dobbs does not in fact offer a compelling mystery. Its focus is rather on the characters Winspear is introducing and on recreating the feel of the period between the wars, in showing, in particular, the effect the First World War had on those who lived through it. But with this back story established in this first book, it will be interesting to see how the Maisie Dobbs mystery series proceeds, whether our heroine's powers of detection will be tested in subsequent installments by mysteries sufficiently gripping to carry a book themselves.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecein this first book, it will be interesting to see how the Maisie Dobbs mystery series proceeds, whether our heroine's powers of detection will be tested in subsequent installments by mysteries sufficiently gripping to carry a book themselves.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-12-18

When an old college friend, choreographer Ruth Renswick, asks for Juliet's advice on the staging of a ballet of Great Expectations, the former professor of English literature finds herself a regular observer of the Jansch Repertory Ballet Troupe's rehearsals--and an observer as well of the rivalries and romances that animate the dancers. But an accident involving the hyper-sexual dancer playing Pip leads Juliet to suspect that someone is out to sabotage her friend's production by injuring, or worse, its male lead.<br /><br />While lovers of dance will enjoy amateur sleuth Juliet Bodine's immersion in the world of professional dance, others may find the lengthy descriptions of the choreography of Great Expectations slow going. The book's plot is likewise on the slow side (as if often true of cozies), its character and culture intended to carry the book forward rather than any thrills. By the end of the book Juliet has become likeable enough, a character whom some readers may want to revisit in further episodes, but I was not immediately drawn to her. (I would have been happier, too, without as intimate a knowledge of her pudendal maladies: \\"On the minus side, however, she was--was she?--a bit raw about the netherbones. On Monday morning, she was definitely itchy. Yeast infection, she diagnosed. She ate a container of yogurt for breakfast and another for lunch, then crossed her fingers. And her legs.\\") My chief problem, however, was with the character of Ruth Renswick. I found it difficult to believe that this successful, driven choreographer would require Juliet's hand-holding so pathetically and for so long a period, especially considering that the help Juliet provided over the course of weeks of attendance at the rehearsals was minimal.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecehe True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-12-09

(He has about as firm a hold on his new responsibilities as Seinfeld's George Costanza did when called upon to handle the Penske file.) Yet Pel might yet keep things under control at work--the requisite meetings with Chinese mafiosi, the disappeared colleagues, the nerve gas and would-be poltergeists--were his home life not so chaotic. Pel lives with his German girlfriend Ursula and their two sons, and virtually every waking moment in their household is filled with the happy couple's bickering. Over every topic imaginable. Happily, their arguing does not arise from a deep-seated problem in their relationship: that would make it difficult reading.

More accustomed to 18-hour work days than sleeping in, Edward finds himself open to two time-consuming experiences he would never have considered previously. For reasons that are unclear to him, Edward is singled out by an English duchess and asked to take on the job of cataloging her family's library of neglected medieval manuscripts. He is at the same time directed to keep an eye out for the work of a certain Gervase of Langford, the codex of author Lev Grossman's title. Edward thinks the job the duchess offers (through her representative) is beneath him, and he is by no means qualified to perform it, but he nevertheless allows himself to be hired. Sucking up the rest of Edward's free time is an (allegedly) addictive computer game with unusually realistic graphics that is lent to him by his friend Zeph. Edward manages through his ineptitude to stumble into levels of the game that more experienced players are not even aware exist. In the weeks before his move to England, Edward becomes engrossed in both these activities, the game and his search for the codex, to the point that he questions whether he will in fact return to the work that had until recently meant everything to him.<br /><br />There is much to recommend Grossman's Codex. The book is filled with beautiful, vivid writing, as, for example, this description of Edward's childhood winters in Bangor, Maine: \\"It took a lot of snow to cancel school, but fortunately for Edward, Bangor got a lot of snow. If it started before he went to bed--and the later it started, the better his chances were--he would lie awake listening to the snow-muffled silence, and once his parents were asleep he would shine a flashlight out the window, watching each snowflake gleam once as it passed through the beam and then vanished into collective anonymity on the lawn.\\" The book's dialogues are well-written also, particularly those conversations in which Edward's friend Zeph has a part. Grossman manages to grab the reader's attention immediately with a charming scene in which Edward first encounters the duchess, and he keeps us interested for a surprisingly long time in the ostensibly unexciting question, Why did these people hire Edward to catalogue their library?<br /><br />In the end, however, the book is a disappointment, principally because its plot is incredible. I cannot believe that Edward became as captivated as he did by his search for the codex, by the duchess herself--who for a time bewitches Edward from afar--or by the computer game, which despite its spiffy graphics does not come across as all that intriguing and does not warrant the many pages of description it is given in the book. Indeed, the subplot of the game might have been excised from the book without detriment to the narrative. One comes in the end not to care very much why the duchess is interested in finding Gervase of Langford's codex--one of the book's great mysteries--but when the answer is finally given it too is difficult to credit. Further, when Edward is hired the task of finding the codex is presented to him as an afterthought, as something he might think about while engaged in the more important task of shelving books. Yet Edward is somehow intended to understand--and remarkably he does understand--that the discovery of the codex is all important. Edward is so sure of himself on this point, in fact, that he goes to the length of hiring, on his own authority, an assistant to help him with the task--graduate student Margaret, whose encyclopedic knowledge of medieval manuscripts is yet another unrealistic element of Grossman's novel.<br /><br />Lev Grossman certainly knows his way around a sentence. Given his talent, Codex could have been a great literary thriller. It's unfortunate that the book'splot does not hang together better.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceplot does not hang together better.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-11-14

A host of needless deaths and the better part of a year later, Carl emerged from the jungle a more mature figure, still the likeable, duty-bound character he had been when he went in, but a world removed from the boys his age who had remained stateside.<br /><br />Clayton's simply titled Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam, narrated in the first person by the title character, succeeds in reading like the first-hand account of a naive GI's wartime experiences. (The novel is presumably autobiographical at least in part: the author is himself a Vietnam veteran who served in the same infantry division in which his character finds himself.) The book is interesting as a primer in the day-to-day living conditions of a soldier in Melcher's shoes--the friendships with fellow soldiers formed quickly in the confines of a bunker, and sometimes terminated even more quickly by gunfire, racial divisions among the troops mirroring those ripping the country apart back home, hard slogs through a dense jungle in which an unseeable enemy may or may not lie hidden. Carl himself never lays eyes on an enemy soldier during his tour, at least not a live one. He describes battle as a hazy experience of firing blindly into the green without knowing who or how many one is opposed against. The overall feeling one has when reading about Carl is that he is a very small figure on a large canvas, his fate entirely out of his hands, yielded to the army and to chance.<br /><br />Despite the losses Carl suffers during his tour and the carnage alluded to in the book--there are no grotesque descriptions of ripped flesh here--Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam does not grip the reader emotionally. This may be deliberate on the author's part, his readers intended to observe Carl's experiences at a remove just as Carl is in a sense removed from them, unable even to see the camouflaged enemy he fires at. More a memoir than a novel, Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam tells its protagonist's story in spare, sometimes inelegant prose which, if not rousing, makes for a very quick read. Anyone interested in a straightforward account of a soldier's experiences in Vietnam will enjoy Clayton's detailed account of Carl Melcher's tour of duty.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecein a sense removed from them, unable even to see the camouflaged enemy he fires at.

Chris Baty, the author of No Plot? No Problem, is the founder of National Novel Writing Month, a bizarre, web-based movement, now in its sixth year, in which would-be novelists are invited to unleash their inner muses, register (for free) at the NaNoWriMo website (NaNoWriMo.org), and crank out the rough draft of a novel during the month of November. Incredibly, more than 25,000 people attempted to do just that in November of 2003, with some 3500 of them crossing the finishing line. (Anyone who writes 50,000 words in the allotted time is declared a winner.) No Plot? No Problem is Baty's brief (about 50,000 words) and breezy companion volume to the literary marathon.<br /><br />In the first part of his book Baty offers readers mostly playful advice. Those undertaking the month-long novel-writing challenge are advised to turn their loved ones into effective agents of guilt, for example. Writers, too, are urged to procure a \\"wearable, writing-enhancing object\\" such as a baseball cap, the better both to put themselves in the mood to write and to signal to family members \\"that you've slipped away into the shadowy Realm of the Novel, and that you are not to be disturbed unless they--or one of the more likable of the family pets--are on fire.\\" Baty also provides practical advice about carving out time in one's schedule for writing. (One past NaNoWriMo winner, a woman from Indiana, reports escaping from her children to find writing time on the toilet. This may be the way things are done in the Midwest, but I'm afraid a bathroom door is insufficient to stop the determined young of New England.)<br /><br />In the second, more meaty part of his book Baty provides a week-by-week guide (intended to be read at the appropriate points in the novel-writing month) to the writing process, with week-appropriate pep talks, exercises, and tips. (For example, the tips provided for week one \\"center on leveraging the adrenaline rush of the first few days, avoiding the pernicious desire to self-edit as you write, creating a convenient home for your castaway thoughts, and maintaining the momentum by keeping your story a mystery to those around you.\\") These four week-specific chapters are followed by a helpful section on the rewrite, the more exacting business of turning one's raw, hastily-scribbled prose into a passable novel once your novel-writing month is over.<br /><br />No Plot? No Problem probably does not provide any advice about writing that readers would not be able to find elsewhere. But Baty is a very good, funny writer, and his enthusiasm for this insane project is infectious. Having begun his fetching* little book a skeptic, you'll finish thinking that writing a novel in a month is not so daft an enterprise after all. It may be that Baty's argument for casting aside one's inhibitions and striving for quantity of words over quality will be just the inspiration you need to sit down and produce a viable first draft.<br /><br />* I love the book's subtly-textured, colorful cover, but the dark gray background of the book's inset notes make for difficult reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecelf-edit as you write, creating a convenient home for your castaway thoughts, and maintaining the momentum by keeping your story a mystery to those around you.\\") These four week-specific chapters are followed by a helpful section on the rewrite, the more exacting business of turning one's raw, hastily-scribbled prose into a passable novel once your novel-writing month is over.<br /><br />No Plot?

The narrator, novelist Sidney Orr, is recovering from a near fatal illness at the time of the purchase, and he hasn't written anything for months, but the graph-paper pages of the notebook inspire him and he writes in it feverishly for hours on end, transported by the notebook such that he becomes wholly unaware of his surroundings. Sidney writes a story about a certain Nick Bowen, an editor at a successful publishing house who responds to a nearly fatal freak accident by abandoning his life and setting out to a randomly selected location, Kansas. He takes with him only what he happens to have been carrying, a manuscript of a previously unknown work--entitled Oracle Night--by a long dead novelist. Nick reads the manuscript repeatedly, and Sidney's would-be readers (and Auster's real-life readers) are told the story of this Oracle Night, that is, the novel within the story within Auster's novel.<br /><br />Auster's Oracle Night, as the above suggests, is a Russian nesting doll of a novel. In addition to the principal stories mentioned above--Sidney's own story told twenty years hence, his short story, the novel within that story--other tales are slipped into the narrative--the reminiscences of various characters, stories told second-hand, Sidney's account of his courtship of his wife, delivered in footnotes. In some cases we are given cause to doubt the veracity of the stories, thus removing them that much further from the present \\"reality\\" in which narrator Sidney Orr is writing his account. (There is cause too, I think, for doubting Sidney's own story, which may be the point of the whole exercise.) What is remarkable about Auster's book, apart from this clever nesting of tales, is that each of the stories one encounters in the novel is so compelling, so vivid in the telling, even the brief ones, that one tends to forget while reading them that they are part of a larger whole. Written in deceptively simple prose, Auster's novel is a complex rumination on truth and storytelling, interesting enough to read in a single sitting, complicated enough to inspire late-night dorm room conversations about what he's really getting at.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecers in the novel is so compelling, so vivid in the telling, even the brief ones, that one tends to forget while reading them that they are part of a larger whole.

Her husband's pharmacy is hemorrhaging money. Her previously overachieving daughter, who is too embarrassed by her mother's profession to mention it to her friends, has taken up with Great Neck's resident bad boy, a shaven-haired hoodlum who doesn't \\"do\\" parents. And Miriam herself has become an object of interest to a broken-hearted client, thuggish restaurateur Vince Guardelli, who just may have fitted an acquaintance or two in his past with cement shoes. As her family's financial difficulties escalate, Miriam must decide whether to sell her psychic abilities on a larger stage, a lucrative option which might further alienate her daughter and disappoint the spirit of her paternal grandmother, her psychic mentor, whose shimmering image appears to Miriam frequently.<br /><br />Rochelle Shapiro's charming debut novel introduces readers to the unusual demands and work-a-day business of an occupation with which most of us won't be familiar. Her Miriam is a fully sympathetic character whose psychic ability is portrayed as more often a curse than an advantage. Not only is the information Miriam receives psychically often incomplete and misleading, but her talent colors people's perceptions of her: Miriam is either fraud or freak, psychic spy or potential savior. It is a burden with which Miriam's creator is herself familiar, for the book is at least to some extent autobiographical: Great Neck resident Rochelle Shapiro is likewise a psychic whose talent was first recognized by her paternal grandmother. Let's hope there's another great read waiting for us in Ms. Shapiro's future.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-10-20
US	52923654	R2NZWVFCKGRZ8K	0006543545	540961512	The Bookshop	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	A good character study, but an unsatisfying novel	Having lived for more than eight years in the East Anglian coastal town of Hardborough, Florence Green determines, in 1959, to purchase the aptly named Old House, a damp and decrepit and indeed haunted property more than 400 years old. Her decision to open a bookshop in the building, while approved by a certain Edmund Brundish, the town's most respected scion, is opposed by an unfortunately more influential resident of Hardborough, Violet Gamart, who has the vague plan of turning the Old House into an art center. Florence's defiance of Mrs. Gamart's will begins an undeclared war between the two women, only one of whom knows for certain that a war is in fact being waged. Penelope Fitzgerald's The Bookshop chronicles the quiet but persistent opposition Florence faces in opening and running the shop as well as her encounters with the odd cast of presumptuous characters who populate Hardborough.<br /><br />The Bookshop  offers some very nice writing, as Fitzgerald's description of a horse forced to submit to having its teeth filed: \\"Once released, the horse sighed cavernously and stared at them as though utterly disillusioned. From the depths of its noble belly came a brazen note, more like a trumpet than a horn, dying away to a snicker.\\" But the book as a whole is not entirely satisfying. The characters are too outspoken to always be credible, including the precocious eleven-year-old who works in the bookshop with Florence. The poltergeist who punctuates the silence of the Old House with its rapping serves no obvious narrative purpose. And the jumps in the narrative, with motivations and intervening action left to the imagination, make the story feel incomplete.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-10-16
US	52923654	R6GQSBCG9L0BI	1586481908	829213511	Mixed Nuts: America's Love Affair With Comedy Teams From Burns And Allen To Belushi And Aykroyd	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Quick and Absorbing Read	In his highly readable book Mixed Nuts, author Lawrence Epstein tracks the history of the comedy team from its origin in minstrel shows, through vaudeville, radio, and film, to its current incarnation in television sitcoms. Along the way Epstein discusses a host of old favorites--from Burns and Allen to Laurel and Hardy, Hope and Crosby to Martin and Lewis--as well as many teams readers will probably never have heard of. The book provides brief accounts of the teams' backgrounds and history, sometimes quoting material from their acts (Epstein provides, for example, a version of Abbott and Costello's \\"Who's on First,\\" which was a pleasure to read), and explaining the teams' appeal given the social milieu of their eras. Gracie Allen's likeable character, for example, a non-threatening woman who maintained her dignity despite her trademark illogic, was \\"a perfect symbol for women caught between Victorian morality and modern mores.\\" Jackie Gleason's Ralph Kramden, struggling to afford the accoutrements of middle-class life in the post-War period, appealed to an audience that was striving for, or had only recently achieved, similar goals. Comedy teams were affected not only by the historical circumstances of their times, of course, but more specifically by technological change. The advent of radio, free entertainment for the masses, is said to have killed vaudeville, but old vaudeville stars who could adapt to the new medium--whose rate of delivery was right for performance on air, whose humor did not depend on visual cues and appealed to a broad audience--teams such as Burns and Allen, thrived in radio.<br /><br />Epstein's account of the comedy team is a quick and absorbing read. Though it is the product of a mountain of research, including dozens of interviews (with the likes of Jerry Stiller, Sid Caesar, and Soupy Sales), the book wears its erudition lightly. Mixed Nuts is filled with interesting bits of information, from the poignant--the tragic death of Lou Costello's infant son--to the just plain neat: Homer Simpson owes his \\"D'oh,\\" for example, to Laurel and Hardy. Most importantly, however, in tracking the development of the comedy team, and in identifying for readers the strands that link current comedy teams--such as Frasier and Niles Crane of the sitcom Frasier--to their comic forbears, Epstein enriches our appreciation of comedians present and past.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceo's infant son--to the just plain neat: Homer Simpson owes his \\"D'oh,\\" for example, to Laurel and Hardy.

The suspect of Michael Robotham's title is Joe O'Loughlin, a perceptive and well-meaning psychologist who, at the age of forty-two, has recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The news sends him into a spiral of self pity until a more immediate and terrible threat arises. Joe finds himself cast as the prime suspect in the unusually vicious murder of a young woman with whom he happens to have had an unpleasant history. Joe assumes at first, as we all probably would, that his innocence will eventually become evident to the dogged detective who has taken a dislike to him. But as the evidence against O'Loughlin adds up, the possibility of a lifetime of incarceration becomes terrifyingly real. With the police unwilling to credit his claim that a volatile patient of his is somehow behind the crime, Joe is forced to try to unravel the real killer's elaborate plot against him while on the run.<br /><br />Robotham tells the story of Joe's descent into a nightmarish conspiracy in spare, highly readable prose that advances the plot quickly. Joe's back story is fleshed out in brief reminiscences that never interrupt the flow of the narrative. The only disappointment in the book comes in the pivotal scenes of its penultimate chapter, when the dramatic action is too rushed and as a result difficult to follow. That aside, Robotham's Suspect is a gripping, well-written thriller that readers will be loath to put down.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-10-06

The eleventh book in Lemony Snicket's wonderfully miserable Series of Unfortunate Events opens with the much oppressed Baudelaire siblings hurtling down the freezing waters of the Stricken Stream atop a toboggan. Rather than meeting their deaths by cracking their heads against one or more sharp rocks, however, as one might suppose likely, our heroes soon find themselves aboard the Queequeg, a leaky submarine under the command of the boorishly loud Captain Widdershins. The craft is manned by the Captain's stepdaughter and by Phil, the unusually optimistic former employee of the Lucky Smells Lumbermill whom the Baudelaires first encountered in The Miserable Mill, the fourth book of Mr. Snicket's series. (Of the Gorgon Medusa, for example, a figure of Greek mythology whose glance turned people to stone, Phil says, \\"She was probably nice, when you got to know her.\\" His rosy view of the world is comical, but it is not an attribute one looks for in an ally when one is fighting an evil villain and his henchmen.) As has been usual for them since the day they learned of their parents' death in a fire, the Baudelaires are hounded throughout this newest installment in the series by the wicked and shiny-eyed Count Olaf and his stylish girlfriend Esmee, both of whom have developed a new and presumably \\"in\\" villainous laugh with which to frighten the non-villainous. The Baudelaires are troubled as well by various horrific phenomena, most notably the Medusoid Mycelium, a poisonous mushroom that waxes and wanes dangerously in the grim grotto of the book's title.<br /><br />The mysterious Mr. Snicket, as in previous volumes of his researches into the Baudelaires' misfortunes, amuses with his clever wordplay, educates with his tangential discussions of vocabulary, and, indeed, alarms us on his behalf with hints dropped into the narrative of his own harrowing life on the run. (\\"And a small, ceramic bowl, with a tight-fitting lid to keep something important inside, might be difficult to find in the laundry room of an enormous hotel,\\" Snicket writes, for example, \\"particularly if there were a terrible villain nearby, making you feel nervous and distracted.\\" Clearly Snicket has lived to tell the tale, but at what cost?) In the end the Baudelaires' lives remain miserable, but perhaps slightly less miserable than they had been, and they are at least a tiny bit closer to uncovering the secrets of the VFD, the enigmatic organization that is a force for good in their world. They are closer too, we must hope, to finally defeating Count Olaf and his troupe of wicked henchmen. There are, after all, only two books remaining in the series.<br /><br />While written for pre-teens, the Snicket series (penned in fact by author Daniel Handler, who has also written some delightful books for adults) is bursting with allusions that will amuse parents. The books are fantastically clever and a joy to read aloud. (If you don't have children to read them to, you may want to rent some.) The Grim Grotto is slower going in its first third than it might be--it should perhaps have been shortened--but it is yet a delightful addition to the series. I urge readers unfamiliar with the books to give them a try.

Cora finds herself miscast as one of eight maids-a-milking in a production of The Twelve Days of Christmas, and Sherry is one of a number of young women playing the Virgin Mary in a live Nativity. When a series of acrostics (not crossword puzzles in this fourth installment of the series) is found with clues threatening the \\"leading lady\\"--apparently Becky Baldwin, star of the play and Sherry's rival for the affections of newspaper reporter Aaron Grant--and when one of the Virgins Mary turns up dead, Cora is more than eager for another round of amateur sleuthing. Also joining Bakerhaven's small and ineffectual police force in trying to solve the town's most recent rash of murders is Englishman Jonathan Doddsworth, a detective with Scotland Yard who happens to be in Bakerhaven visiting his estranged family. Meanwhile, regular cast member Harvey Beerbaum, Bakerhaven's other cruciverbalist, appears to be as suspicious as ever of Cora's alleged puzzle-solving abilities. In the future, however, he is apt to be more trusting: this time around Cora is finally forced into solving a puzzle in the presence of onlookers, an occasion in the Puzzle Lady's universe similar in import to Clark Kent having to change clothes in a crowded locker room.<br /><br />The mystery in Hall's A Puzzle in a Pear Tree will keep readers happily guessing to the end, though they may be disappointed finally in a solution that is difficult to credit. But the most surprising thing about the book is the dramatic change in the character of Cora Felton. Portrayed in the first three books of the series as a chain-smoking lush, Cora doesn't pick up a cigarette or a bottle for the first 200 pages of this installment, and we never see her drunk. It is odd that this change in Cora's habits--if it is indeed to be a lasting alteration in her character--has occurred without comment, but it is nevertheless welcome: Cora's more usual celebration of her self-destructive habits and the author's treatment of them as charming, even comical, have been serious impediments to my enjoyment of the series. In A Puzzle in a Pear Tree we get the clever crime solver without, for the most part, the unfortunate habits that would render her noisome and obnoxious--and too close to an early death--in real life.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecek.

They have in fact constituted, they understand--together with their English professor mother and their inventor father--the perfect family, the sort of nuclear unit other families aspire to be, a self-contained quintet of tall, attractive, intelligent people who pepper their discourse with literary allusions and entertain themselves with ingenious made-up games. But when the girls discover that their mother has had an affair, and when their father refuses to join them in condemning her, the sisters become as disgusted with their family's imperfection, with their parents' failure to live up to the family's moral standards, as they had been convinced of its superiority. The younger Greens choose to divorce themselves from their parents, and they move out of their New York apartment to New Haven, where Meg is in her third year at Yale. Together the sisters face the logistical difficulties, unanticipated by them, of a life lived without parents.<br /><br />Katharine Weber's The Little Women, which follows in broad strokes the plot laid down by Alcott's book, takes the form of an autobiographical novel written by middle sister Joanna and punctuated with disapproving notes penned by her sisters. Meg and Amy complain throughout about, alternately, Joanna's departures from the truth in her novelized portrayal of their exploits and her too intimate revelations about them. Their comments refer to events that occur outside the scope of the story Joanna tells, and thus supplement what we know about the Greens' lives while furthering our understanding of their characters.<br /><br />Weber's novel tells an interesting story in an unusual way, and in sometimes very pleasing prose, such as this description of Joanna's initial response to the lobby of their New Haven apartment: \\"The small lobby was disappointingly dingy, and Joanna privately hoped its faintly urinaceous atmosphere had arrived with them as a lingering memento of their taxi ride and wasn't going to be an olfactory theme of their new lives.\\" I do have some complaints with the book: Amy's tyrannical substitute teacher in her public high school in New Haven seems too cruel to be believed, and a scene in which the girls' roommate Teddy, acquired at the beginning of the school year, expresses a romantic interest in Joanna seems unprepared for.  In the early part of the book the girls' dialogue sometimes struck me as unrealistic, but this fault may be attributable to the purported author of the book--Joanna, about whose lack of facility in writing her sisters regularly complain--rather than to Weber herself. It is noteworthy, at any rate, that my other complaints about the book were answered, in a sense, by the book itself: just as I was becoming annoyed at Joanna's over-long description of her family's perfection, for  example, her sisters' scholia intruded to tell the author to cut it out. And while I found it difficult to sympathize with the Green sisters' overreaction to their parents' \\"faults\\"--sundering a happy home because they are unable to forgive their mother--I was not alone in my criticism of them: parentless, good guy Teddy was present to express his own impatience with the girls.<br /><br />Well-written, and interesting for its unusual form, Weber's book also appeals--to me, at least--for its accurate depiction of Yale life and New Haven landmarks. Readers familiar with Weber's earlier work, too, will get a nice surprise in the appearance--in a sort of deus ex machina role--of photographer Harriet Rose, the protagonist of the author's first novel, Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceeece	2004-09-25

This brand of southern gentility and a reliance on the comforts of routine have sustained Wilma--\\"Miss Wilma,\\" the piano teacher of Lynn York's title--through marriage and motherhood and fifteen years of loneliness after her husband's suicide. But the price of maintaining equanimity has been a failure to communicate fully with the people closest to her. Wilma's relationship with her daughter Sarah, in particular, has suffered for it. During the course of the novel Wilma's ability to move through life seemingly unaffected is tested by a string of dramatic events: the unexpected attentions of a suitor, the murder of one of her Mayberry-sized town's policemen, and the unannounced appearance on her front porch of Wilma's troubled daughter and granddaughter.<br /><br />Although its plot revolves in part around a nasty murder and its solution, Lynn York's The Piano Teacher is a sweet, quiet novel. In it the relationships between Wilma and Sarah, and between Sarah and her husband, are explored and, while we're watching, subtly altered. The characters--particularly that of Wilma--are well drawn, and life in a small community in which non-conformity is checked by the threat of scandal is nicely evoked. The book gets off to a slow start in its initial chapter, but readers who keep with the book will be rewarded.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-09-21
US	52923654	RF01AT0IEFO2E	0309068355	6339969	Buzzwords: A Scientist Muses on Sex, Bugs, and Rock 'n' Roll	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A hilarious introduction to the insect community	It is clear from the prologue of May Berenbaum's Buzzwords that readers of the book are in for a good time. The author's breezy, conversational description of the bug-related essays to follow--most of them written in the 1990s and reprinted, with minor revisions, from the author's column in American Entomologist--culminates in her apologia for including in her otherwise user-friendly prose the scientific names of the critters under discussion:<br /><br />\\"But before you proceed, here's a word of warning. In these essays, you'll encounter scientific names. For reasons I'm not entirely clear on, these seem to alarm people, even some biologists, unnecessarily. These names, which are written in Latin and consist of two parts, the genus followed by the species, are used not to impress people with dazzling displays of arcane knowledge; I don't know that I've ever won anyone's heart or stopped a fight or brought the world one step closer to peace and tranquility by reeling off a scientific name at a critical juncture. They're used simply because they're really very useful.\\"<br /><br />And we readers are hooked. There follow 42 brief, amusingly-titled essays divided into four broad categories: how entomologists see insects, how the world sees insects, how entomologists see themselves, and how an entomologist sees science.<br /><br />While written initially for the amusement of entomologists, Berenbaum's essays are accessible to the general public, both those who are enamored of, or at least tolerant of, the beasties with whom she works and those more squeamish readers who believe that in a perfect world all bugs would perish from the face of the earth. (Not that I'm choosing sides here.) Moreover, though readers who are not scientifically inclined will occasionally encounter passages in Berenbaum's essays that are beyond their ken, this should by no means dissuade them from reading the book: there is much here that can be appreciated by the ignorant layman.<br /><br />Berenbaum's subject matter, if always bug-related, is otherwise varied. In a delightful discussion of flatulence (\\"Putting on airs\\"), for example, both human and insect, we learn that termites may be responsible for a scandalous proportion of the earth's atmospheric methane levels. In the same essay Ms. Berenbaum further informs us that the manifold varieties of human flatulence are codified in the apparently otherwise stolid, doorstop-sized Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (which reports, we are told, that the \\"open sphincter\\" type is \\"said to be of higher temperature and more aromatic\\").<br /><br />In \\"Ain't no bugs in me!\\" we read of the alarming tendency of insects to find their way into various of the human body's orifices. There is the case of the appearance of maggots in a Japanese girl's urogenital tract as well as the infestation of a London man's nasal cavities with the sheep nasal bot fly--an occurrence which is not, we are told, \\"all that uncommon in shepherds and in other people who for whatever reason choose to spend a lot of time around sheep,\\" but which is apparently unusual indeed among sheepless Englishmen.<br /><br />Berenbaum discusses sexual cannibalism among praying mantids in her essay \\"A prayer before dining\\": decapitating the mantid male prior to intercourse, she reports, removes his inhibitions. And in \\"Entomological legwork\\" the author describes the disturbing circumstances under which she reached \\"the profound realization that cockroaches are just not like us.\\"<br /><br />But it was with particular interest that I read Berenbaum's essay \\"Kids Pour Coffee on Fat Girl Scouts,\\" wherein she writes about the various mnemonic devices she's come across in her academic career--those for remembering the 12 spinal nerves (\\"On Old Olympus' Towering Tops / A Finn and German Viewed Some Hops\\") and the 10 classes of stars, for example (\\"Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me Right Now, Sweetheart\\"). The teaching assistants of her  undergraduate geology class, sheremembers, taught an alternate version of the mnemonic usually used for rendering the Moh scale of hardness in minerals. It's traditionally rendered as \\"Texas Girls Can Flirt And Other Queer Types Can Do,\\" but, Berenbaum writes, \\"according to the version the teaching assistants taught us, the Texas girls were considerably friendlier and had moved well beyond flirting.\\"<br /><br />Berenbaum is a very good and a very funny writer. she may not make readers who are hostile to the insect community any more forgiving of those hordes of roaches and carpenter ants and tsetse flies awaiting their chance to wrest from humanity the mantle of world dominance...but she sure makes it fun to read about them....<br /><br />...But before I go I should say one more thing, by way of full disclosure: while I have never met or communicated with Ms. Berenbaum, and while she certainly can have no idea who I am, we do enjoy a relationship of sorts. You know those foul-mouthed teaching assistants who, to extract their cheap pleasures from the business of education, corrupted a perfectly serviceable device for remembering the Moh scale of hardness?

US	52923654	R3QF71NG0SR4LI	1575668858	131825650	Posted To Death: A Simon Kirby-Jones Mystery	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A clever cozy with a little bite	Dr. Simon Kirby-Jones, an American recently moved to the quaint English village of Snupperton Mumsley, is a man of many secrets. A successful author of respected histories, Simon also churns out best-selling historical romances and a popular series of mysteries, which he publishes pseudonymously. He is also gay, which, if not exactly a secret, is a piece of information he imagines would alarm the straight-laced but nonetheless dishy local vicar. Most interesting, however, is the fact that everything Simon does, from cranking out genre fiction to mooning over married clerics, he does posthumously: young Dr. Kirby-Jones, as it happens, is a vampire.<br /><br />It being wise for vampires to cultivate good relations with their neighbors, Simon immerses himself upon his arrival in Snupperton Mumsley in various local civic projects. He joins the Church Restoration Fund Committee, for example, and becomes interested in the Snupperton Mumsley Amateur Dramatic Society's rancorous debate over the selection of a new play. These activities allow Simon to become acquainted with the village's more civic-minded residents--the snobbish aristocrat Lady Prunella Blitherington (nee Ragsbottom), for example, the Miss Marple-ish Jane Hardwick, the poorly coiffed and abrasive postmistress Abigail Winterton.<br /><br />It is less difficult than one might suppose for Simon to blend in with the locals, as medical advances have, in his world, taken the bite out of vampirism. The pills Simon takes twice daily mean that he needn't avoid sunlight--though he is careful to wear sunglasses--or suck the blood of unwilling donors for his daily sustenance. As a newly minted vampire, Simon has in fact never had to engage in traditional vampire activities, and he finds the whole blood-sucking, burying-oneself-in-cemeteries business a bit disgusting. Indeed, apart from a few small differences, Simon is indistinguishable from humans: his hearing is inhumanly acute, he cannot ingest garlic and live to tell about it, he can get by on very little sleep. The last of these is a boon as far as literary productivity goes, and it comes in handy as well when Simon turns to late-night sleuthing after a Snupperton Mumsley-ite is murdered.<br /><br />Dean James' first Simon Kirby-Jones mystery is a delightful romp of a novel, but it is a disappointment that the author has elected to effectively defang his protagonist. The book would have been much more fun if Simon had had to satisfy his vampiric appetites at least occasionally, fussily wiping the blood from his lips, perhaps, as he returns after the hunt to the drawing rooms of polite society. As it is, Simon's interests are informed less by his vampirism than by the more mundane fact of his homosexuality. Nonetheless, James' clever cozy is definitely worth a read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecel about it, he can get by on very little sleep.

Waters' wife has been depressed for several years, following two miscarriages, and his otherwise successful oil-drilling business is under investigation by the EPA and is threatened besides by the irresponsible personal behavior of his business partner and life-long friend Cole Smith. Potentially devastating though these difficulties are, however, they will seem insignificant to Waters two weeks later, after he has been tempted into the first affair of his marriage by an aggressive seductress, real estate agent Eve Sumner. Sumner, as it turns out, is not your average cleavage-baring predator. She is willing to do anything necessary to wrest Waters from his wife, and she is armed with a peculiarly effective bait: intimate knowledge of Waters' relationship with his college sweetheart, the sexually aggressive, frighteningly possessive--and verifiably deceased--Mallory Candler. Waters' descent into infidelity leads him to question his sense of reality. Is he mad to consider transmigration of the soul as an explanation for Eve's uncanny likeness to and knowledge of Mallory?  Or is Sumner part of a convoluted plot designed to unhinge our hero?<br /><br />The characters of Iles' Sleep No More inhabit the same world the author described in his novel The Quiet Game--Natchez, Mississippi, which Iles, a real-life inhabitant of the town, describes eloquently. And it is peopled by some of the same characters: Penn Cage, the protagonist of Iles' earlier novel, takes on a supporting role here. One need not be familiar with The Quiet Game, however, to enjoy the author's more recent effort. But enjoy it you will. After a relatively unhurried introduction, readers will find themselves, perhaps a third of the way through the book, willing the likeable Waters to somehow extricate himself from a relationship that threatens to destroy him. But saving himself and his family, we understand, cannot be a simple business. While Iles' novel ends perhaps a bit too conveniently, it is otherwise well-written, and it is genuinely gripping. Sleep No More is just the thing to keep readers from resting in peace themselves.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecederstand, cannot be a simple business.

Teen-aged girls mooning over matinee idols turn quickly into hardened farm wives with work-ravaged hands and too many children. But more onerous than the simple demands of survival in a difficult environment are the constraints imposed by the small town's repressive society, whose members abhor and squelch diversity and police behavior with vicious gossip and shaming. The three women on whom Sharratt's quietly suspenseful novel focuses are each eager to be free of the confinements imposed on them from without, to shed their identities and become reborn, to have possibilities open before them. Of the three, former Chicago society matron Cora Egan has largely succeeded in shedding her past by the time the novel begins. Having fled, pregnant, from her abusive husband, Cora settled on her grandfather's farm, which she now operates by herself, doing men's work while dressed in men's clothing. Since she has elected to live outside the roles prescribed by society for women, Cora is despised and feared in Minerva--a situation which has the potential to make her life not only lonely but dangerous. Cora is joined on the farm eventually by fifteen-year-old Penny Niebeck, who is herself fleeing the shameful behavior of her mother--an affair with a married man--which threatens to render them both outcasts. Together Cora and Penny raise Cora's infant daughter, working hard but happily--an idyllic period that readers will constantly sense is threatened by the potential re-appearance of the baby's abusive father.<br /><br />Mary Sharratt's novel is about repression and rebirth and heroism, about the difficulty of simple living in early 20th-century, rural America, about the relationship between parents and children and the nearly insuperable obstacles that can rise up between people incapable of communicating. And it is about how a life's course can be altered irrevocably by a handful of choices. Despite the weight of the book's subject matter and the casual cruelty and violence it depicts (but does not wallow in), the story Sharratt tells is ultimately uplifting. Her heroines persevere and finally survive, scarred but strengthened by adversity, adopting in their different ways the strategies exemplified by the characters of Athena (whose Roman counterpart, Minerva, lends her name to the characters' home town) and Penelope in Homer's Odyssey. (Throughout much of The Real Minerva Penny is in the course of reading the epic, and Sharratt weaves the stories of Athena and Penelope lightly into her narrative. My one complaint about Sharratt's novel is that her Odyssean references sometimes struck me as forced.) The Real Minerva is a rich, beautifully written novel, and it is highly recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecet is about how a life's course can be altered irrevocably by a handful of choices.

US	52923654	RXGH6XLCSH3HS	0312986033	545051235	Masquerade	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	A decent thriller	The protagonist of Gayle Lynds' thriller Masquerade has lost her memory. Unable to recall even her name, she knows only as much of her past as her caretaker Gordon tells her: she is his fiancee, Liz Sansborough, a retired CIA agent who has been living under cover as a journalist and who is being targeted by one of the world's deadliest assassins, the Carnivore. Liz's reactions when under attack, she finds, are indeed those of a trained operative, but her occasional near memories don't correspond with what she's been told. Her hunt for her identity takes Liz away from Gordon's grasp, finally, and into the thick of a dangerous game of international intrigue in which identifying the bad guys is hard, and outrunning them even harder.<br /><br />Masquerade, if not unputdownable, is a decent thriller with transparent prose and a likeable protagonist (who figures also in Lynds' more recent novel The Coil). The book unfortunately ends on a disappointing note, with a final chapter that strains credibility, but I would nonetheless enjoy reading more from this author.	2004-08-24

Alone on stage and elegantly attired, Pujol demonstrated his peculiar ability to take in copious quantities of air or water at will through his rectum and to expel either when convenient, a skill which allowed him to perform a number of spectacular feats. Pujol used his disciplined flatulence, for example, to blow out candles (from a distance of 12 inches) or to shoot jets of water--sucked in immediately beforehand--as far as four or five yards. He could imitate various animals with his emissions and could play recognizable tunes. (A newspaper of the day reports: \\"In reality he produced only four notes, the do, mi, sol, and do of the octave. I cannot guarantee that each of these notes was tonally true.\\") And in a coup de grace that would have left Howard Stern screaming for more, Le Petomane would insert a rubber hose into his anus and, thrusting a cigarette into the hose's free end, would enjoy a rectal smoke, his sphincter alternately breathing in and exhaling. (Pujol played the flute using the same apparatus.)<br /><br />In his very brief (95 pages in my edition, with photographs) biography, author Jean Nohain tells the bizarre story of Le Petomane, an evidently kindly baker, and a father of ten, who was determined to use his talent for flatulence for good. It is an arresting story, of course, but there is unfortunately much to fault in the writing and translation into English of the book itself: References that demand explanation (caf' conc', Kam-Hill) but go unremarked, an off-putting introductory chapter that relies almost exclusively on quoted material, a general lack of cohesion throughout. But if you do read Le Petomane you will very likely never forget it, and you will almost certainly mention it to at least one friend--which is more than can be said about many better books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecen be said about many better books.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-08-19

Already a published author upon his arrival at Cambridge as an undergraduate (in 1841), Thomson went on to a distinguished career during which he made advances in the studies of electricity and magnetism, heat and light,  as well as establishing the existence of an absolute zero--the work with which he is probably most readily identified. But Thomson was, above all else, a practical thinker who most enjoyed applying scientific principles to the solution of real-life problems. Thus, while involved in the various attempts that were made to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable, Thomson invented the mirror galvanometer, a more sensitive instrument for receiving electronic pulses than had previously been available. Likewise, Thomson's interest in sailing led to his invention of sounding machines for aid in navigation and the design of a more reliable naval compass.<br /><br />Lindley's account of Thomson's life and career alternates in the telling between discussions of science and of personality. The former will be appreciated by readers with some scientific background, but Lindley does not dumb down his technical discussions sufficiently for the aid of the general reader. Far more accessible is Lindley's discussion of Kelvin's life outside of the laboratory, as for example his account of the subtle battle between the young William and his somewhat domineering father James--over the former's expenses, attentiveness to school work, social contacts, moral  probity, exercise, conduct of professional relationships, and so on. James Thomson was involved in the particulars of William's life and early career to a degree that must have been maddening to the young man. (Much of their struggle revolved around a position that opened at Glasgow University, where James Thomson was a professor of mathematics. James wanted desperately for his son to work at the University. William got the position, at the age of 22, and stayed there for more than fifty years.) There are, too, rewarding accounts of the various luminaries with whom Thomson came into contact, such as the autodidact Michael Faraday (whose accomplishments and personality have clearly impressed the author).<br /><br />Lindley frames his biography with a discussion of the unfortunate fact of Kelvin's career that he became in his later life something of a dinosaur, clinging stubbornly to antiquated ideas--such as an upper age for the earth of a mere 100 million years--while science advanced around him. Celebrated in his life, Kelvin has suffered a posthumous diminution of reputation. Such is the \\"tragedy\\" of Lindley's subtitle (\\"A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy\\"), but it is overstated. Kelvin's life was filled with frenetic, joyous work on projects that fascinated him, and he was appreciated during his lifetime for his contributions. If in some areas Kelvin's conclusions were wrongheaded, he was yet responsible for substantial scientific advances. He seems to have been a wholly fascinating figure, and Lindley does a service in making his story available to readers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceis son to work at the University.

It is unclear whether Paul's study of the manuscript had ever been manageable in its scope: \\"The Significance of Bird Imagery in the Hypnerotomachia\\" is the sort of topic one might have expected. But by the end of senior year, at least, Paul is intent on nothing less than deciphering the great secret of the text--hundreds of pages long though it may be and written in numerous languages--a task that has already proved beyond the efforts of half a millennium's worth of scholars. Great insights come to Paul in the eleventh hour, however, and solving the book's riddle seems to be within his grasp. There follows conflict in the form of a pair of jealous Hypnerotomachia scholars who have made no headway with the book themselves, and various calamities ensue. All of this is related to the reader by Paul's friend and fellow Princeton student Tom Sullivan, who is himself the son of a Hypnerotomachia scholar.<br /><br /> The Rule of Four has been praised in some quarters as the next DaVinci Code, but while Dan Brown's bestseller offers nail-biting suspense and characters one can root for, The Rule of Four is a dull slog in the company of uninteresting characters. Its principal problem is one of credibility. We are to believe that a freshman arrived in Princeton preoccupied already with an obscure Renaissance text to the extent that he was able to recite in chronological order the publications of a Renaissance historian who had worked on that text. And we are to believe that during his senior year Paul's friend Tom worked on the Hypnerotomachia himself for ten hours a day, neglecting his own thesis and his girlfriend and any other responsibilities he may have had. Clearly Tom must have been besotted by the book, and indeed we are told throughout The Rule of Four that the Hypnerotomachia is beguiling: \\"...the Hypnerotomachia is a siren, a fetching song on a distant shore, all claws and clutches in person,\\" Tom's father had once told him. \\"You court her at your risk.\\" But apart from such melodramatic assertions there is nothing in The Rule of Four to make us very interested in the Hypnerotomachia, or to make us understand why Tom's father and other scholars were so passionate about it.<br /><br /> There are other problems with The Rule of Four as well, colorless descriptions of characters (Paul \\"was driven by a curiosity that made him a pleasure to meet and converse with\\") and unrealistic dialogue (are college kids really saying things like \\"nip it in the bud\\" these days?). There is a ridiculous passage in which Paul recounts his thesis advisor's parable about a certain Rodge Epp Lang's beating of a dog: Paul recognized at once that the name is an anagram of \\"doppelganger.\\" (Had the thesis advisor in fact beaten a dog? It doesn't matter.) In short, The Rule of Four is a great disappointment, lacking in suspense, its premise impossible to credit. Readers looking for their next clever literary mystery are advised to bypass this one.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecehave been besotted by the book, and indeed we are told throughout The Rule of Four that the Hypnerotomachia is beguiling: \\"...the Hypnerotomachia is a siren, a fetching song on a distant shore, all claws and clutches in person,\\" Tom's father had once told him. \\"You court her at your risk.\\" But apart from such melodramatic assertions there is nothing in The Rule of Four to make us very interested in the Hypnerotomachia, or to make us understand why Tom's father and other scholars were so passionate about it.<br /><br /> There are other problems with The Rule of Four as well, colorless descriptions of characters (Paul \\"was driven by a curiosity that made him a pleasure to meet and converse with\\") and unrealistic dialogue (are college kids really saying things like \\"nip it in the bud\\" these days?).

Maarten Troost and his girlfriend Sylvia moved in their mid-twenties, in the late 90s, to Tarawa, the capital of the Republic of Kiribati, a country in the equatorial Pacific that is composed of 33 atolls--comprising in toto a mere 300 square miles--spread across a patch of ocean as big as the continental United States. Sylvia had been hired as the new director of the Kiribati office of the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific, succeeding in this position an ostensibly malevolent, angular woman who, as she herself explained--dyspeptically, ill-omenedly--just couldn't take it anymore. Troost, who had recently finished graduate school in Washington D.C. and was looking to avoid serious work, and who besides had a yen for travel in lesser-known locales, was in Kiribati as a hanger-on and adventurer. He would also, of course, serve as a chronicler of the exotica to be encountered.<br /><br /> Among the first things Troost found worthy of thus chronicling after his arrival in Kiribati was his first blissful swim in the Pacific--all palm trees and booming surf and brilliant sun--an idyllic atmosphere that was marred by what Troost found waiting for him in the shallows when he waded back to shore: there, directly between the author and dry land, was a large pair of defecating human buttocks, whose owner soon took to wiping himself with twigs and casting aloft these feces-laden utensils on the outgoing tide...outgoing, that is, in the direction of our in-wading author. Troost later discovered that at low tide the beaches of his atoll tended to be pockmarked by reeking piles of human and animal waste.<br /><br /> Apart from fecal matters, which seem to loom very large indeed on Tarawa, Troost discusses the surprising abundance of fabric softener on the atoll (surprising, that is, as the I-Kiribati do not own a single dryer among them), the difficulty of riding a bike in an equatorial climate on a road covered with pigs and chickens while holding a large, wet fish, and the unexpected allure of cannibalism: \\"I had no desire to eat anyone's arm, but once you've digested raw sea worms and boiled moray eels you begin to think a little more creatively about what precisely constitutes food.\\" There are, besides, bits of good-humored, informative narrative thrown in. In a section on the ethnic origins of the I-Kiribati, for example, Troost writes of the possibility that the original population of the atoll had once been displaced--read \\"eaten\\"--by savage Polynesians from Samoa:<br /><br /> \\"The Polynesians worshipped the god Rongo, and what Rongo liked was human flesh. The sails of their war canoes were creatively decorated with the likeness of a human head, called te bou-uoua. There was another crest called tim-tim-te-rara. This translates as drip-drip-the-blood, a reference to the heads driven on stakes that Rongo liked to see scattered around like knickknacks.

Success depends rather on the personality and writerly wit of its author. And J. Maarten Troost is a very fine writer indeed.

In the meantime she is enjoying the life rural Ireland has to offer in the off-season--solitude and an unprecedented closeness to and awareness of the elements, a barely electrified dwelling that's not \\"on the phone,\\" stoic donkeys and an abundance of mostly nameless cats, the unspeakable beauty of her surroundings. Contrary to the expectations of her unknown masters, Patricia is writing about her experience in Ireland, an account that turns out to be more personal than art historical, as was her original intent. Her journal, the notebook she hides behind a secret panel in the cottage, is the text of The Music Lesson. From it we learn of the life Patricia has put on hold in New York and of the personal tragedy that has left her numbed for several years, and we are told of the family history and the subtle indoctrination that have culminated in her current situation.<br /><br /> Katharine Weber's The Music Lesson is an elegant little novel about loyalty and loss and disillusionment. Its protagonist is not always empathetic--Patricia crosses a line, foolishly and devastagingly, perhaps not quite believably, when she follows Mickey's lead--but she regains our support in the tense but quiet action of the book's end. As with her first book, Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear, Weber's sophomore effort proves that she is an author worth watching.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-07-21

As a sysop Harper can cruise the hundreds of discussions within EROS, his presence in allegedly private chat rooms undetected by the participants, and he can take part in discussions himself under assumed identities. It is an avocation his wife Drewe--a beautiful and highly intelligent obstetrician--has become uncomfortable with in recent months.<br /><br />As it happens, there is much to be uncomfortable about. When author Karen Wheat, an EROS client with whom Harper is more than passably familiar, is found beheaded, Harper contacts the authorities: a number of EROS clients have gone missing, and he thinks he knows who's behind their disappearances. But Harper's noble attempt to stop a serial killer's grotesque butcheries lands him and  his family in peril.<br /><br />Greg Iles's Mortal Fear is not a perfect book. There are some loose threads left dangling in the narrative (particularly the \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" side story), and Harper is made on p. 439 to consider briefly an action entirely unworthy of his character. Some of the middle chapters, too, are rather slow going. But the book builds to a breakneck pace, so that in its final 200 pages you will forgive the story its flaws, cursing the interruptions of impertinent employers and offspring while you neglect your responsibilities and read Iles's exciting conclusion.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-07-19

Belle is enjoying the respite from a brutal Massachusetts winter, but she has had misgivings about the project from the get-go. Her uneasiness was triggered by the brusque behavior of a gang of Polaroid-snapping set designers who descended on Belle's native Newcastle before the filming. Now that shooting has begun, things have only gotten worse: a series of accidents is plaguing the production, and a real-life shooting claims the life of one of Anatomy's principal characters. To make matters worse, Belle receives a series of anonymously authored crossword puzzles whose answers suggest that the constructor has information about the murderer's identity.<br /><br />Also hobnobbing with the Hollywood types in Anatomy of a Crossword--with the spoiled celebrities and soulless industry executives and the suspiciously jumpy screenwriter who are making the movie--are Belle's husband, private eye Rosco Polycrates, and Newcastle's grand dame Sara Briephs, who manages to land a part in the film. (When these characters are not on the scene for a part of the book, before they follow Belle to Hollywood, one misses them: the series' charm has much to do with the pleasant interactions its characters enjoy.)<br /><br />Anatomy of a Crossword, like its predecessors in the series, is a pleasant cozy with a clever enough story line to keep readers guessing to the end. Mystery fans and crossword lovers should enjoy the book, the latter particularly so as readers are invited to try to solve the case along with Belle and Rosco: six crosswords--and a puzzle of a different sort--are included in the book. Familiarity with the other titles in the series is not essential, so new readers need not fear jumping into the Blanc book mid-series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece>Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-07-18

Rose's new series of Butterfield Institute novels, is a perceptive therapist and a newly divorced mother, an expert in sexuality with, at least in recent years, more theoretical knowledge of the subject than hands-on experience. She is troubled still by an unusually sad childhood--details of which drip into the narrative of The Halo Effect--from which she emerged scarred with abandonment issues. Morgan is a fully realized, multi-dimensional, wholly likeable character. And she is an unlikely amateur sleuth, which is part of the charm of Rose's new series: criminal suspense has not found a home before in the halls of a sex therapy clinic.<br /><br />Morgan, who has worked with the police in past cases, becomes involved again when a serial killer begins murdering prostitutes and posing them, in death, in a series of religiously significant, grotesque tableaux. Dr. Snow numbers many prostitutes--both incarcerated and not--among her patients, so the crimes are of especial concern for her. But what is most alarming is the recent disappearance of one of her favorites: call girl Cleo Thane has enjoyed an almost Mayflower-Madamish level of success but may have put her career and person in jeopardy by writing a tell-nearly-all book about her high-powered clients.<br /><br />The Halo Effect is not your usual suspense novel. Not only is the occupation of its principal sleuth unconventional, but Rose's writing is somehow similarly unexpected. She eschews hackneyed expression while bathing her subjects in rich description. See, for example, her oblique description of the (sub-)eponymous Butterfield Institute: \\"There is a small brass plaque on the outside of the building, identifying it but giving little else away: The Butterfield Institute. The black cursive letters are etched deeply into the metal plate. Run your fingers over them and you feel the edges pushing into your flesh. Could you cut your skin on those edges and draw blood? Probably not, but even if you did, none of us inside could offer more than a Band-Aid.\\"<br /><br />As must be obvious by now, I liked Rose's book very much. And I am eager to read the second installment in the series, which will reportedly be released in April of 2005--farther off than I should like.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceges and draw blood?

The problem is, feverish and delirious as he's been, Kinky does not make the most convincing of witnesses, and neither the police he summons nor his gang of variously accented, frequently inebriated cronies--the so-called \\"Village Irregulars,\\" the collective Grace Kelly to his laid up Jimmy Stewart--believe him. When further investigation suggests Kinky wasn't imagining things, the game, as he and Sherlock like to say, is afoot.<br /><br />But the mystery in The Prisoner of Vandam Street is in a sense beside the point, entertaining though it is, for Kinky Friedman's novel is a departure from standard mystery fare. The author's prose is bursting with word play and Conan Doyleisms and pop culture references and irreverent philosophical musings. If at times it borders on the cloying, his writing is far more often downright funny:<br /><br />\\"Now, I'm not making light of people who are deaf or losing their hearing. I am not mocking a disability that afflicts millions of Americans as they grow older, effectively cutting them off to varying degrees from the hearing world. All I'm saying, and I'll try to speak loudly and slowly and enunciate clearly, is that they should get medical help or a hearing aid or a large, metal ear-horn like the kind that was used in medieval times, and stop constantly blaming hapless, sensitive friends like myself for mumbling.\\"<br /><br />Friedman also has a serious side, evidenced in the book's closing parable and in the sweetly moving, brief chapter on his--Kinky the character's as well as Kinky the man's--continued sense of loss after the death of his parents.<br /><br />In short, mystery lovers with a taste for off-color jokes and pun-punctuated prose will get a kick out of Kinky.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece<br /><br />In short, mystery lovers with a taste for off-color jokes and pun-punctuated prose will get a kick out of Kinky.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-07-08

When he meets Joanna Cross, a staff writer for the magazine Around Town who has just published an article exposing a couple of  mind-readers as con artists, an interesting group project suggests itself: Sam and Joanna decide to enlist volunteers to help them conjure up a ghost. The phantom they have in mind is not your run-of-the-mill, graveyard-haunting variety, but rather a thought-form that the group members will hallucinate into being, after extensive research into the time period from which their ghost hails, and after creating for him an elaborate back-story. The problem is, once you will something into being, it may not be eager to give up the ghost, as it were, when you'd like it to.<br /><br />David Ambrose's thriller Superstition is intelligent and genuinely scary in parts, and its conclusion, despite being hinted at in a prologue, is impossible to figure out in advance. Part Jack Finney's Time and Again (a book the characters in Superstition in fact discuss), part ghost story, the book--if not offering the sort of suspense that will keep you glued to the pages all night--is well worth the read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-07-06

His Visitors from Above is a hit among conspiracy theorists, all UFOs and alien abductions  and the enigmatic disinformation specialists of Scott Spencer's title--those fellows who, \\"sallow of complexion\\" and inappropriately dressed, can convince alien spotters, Tommy Lee Jones-like, that they haven't seen anything whatever out of the ordinary. But financial success and the celebrity of a national book tour are difficult to swallow when they spring from a product Sam can neither feel proud of nor claim as his own. They are, moreover, empty rewards against the backdrop of Sam's crumbling personal life, his failing marriage, his teenaged son's recent disappearance.<br /><br />Scott Spencer's Men in Black offers readers a complex story about one man's belated recognition of his life's value. Unfortunately, Spencer's late bloomer was not a man I could empathize with. Sam and his wife and son, the characters through whose eyes the story is told, are unlikable creatures who are dissatisfied with their circumstances--the perfectly good, indeed arguably enviable circumstances of their lives--and they make matters worse for themselves by behaving badly. In the end I did not care what the Hollands wound up doing with their lives--though I was certain alien abduction was not in the cards for them--figuring that they had merited whatever unpleasantness (divorce, incarceration) might lay in store after the last page. A good premise, then, but Men in Black fails, finally, because its characters cannot engage the reader's emotions.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-07-02

Hired in 1996, in the early days of the e-tailer's historic march to world domination (Marcus was employee number 55), the author watched the value of his stock options explode in value during his tenure, and he saw his job as a provider of editorial content become increasingly marginalized as Amazon turned to \\"personalization widgets\\" to automate the content of its pages.<br /><br />For an Amazon enthusiast like myself (I placed my first order--for a copy of Alison Weir's The Wars of the Roses--relatively early, in October of 1997, and have handed over bagfuls of money to the company since), Amazonia offers a titillating view of life behind the web site. Have you ever wondered, for example, what a professional Amazonian's take on the reviews of Harriet Klausner (Amazon's top-ranked reviewer) might be? But the book also reminds us of our recent history, which, given the frenetic pace of change in the computer age, seems very long ago indeed--those early days in the mid-90's when the average man on the street was only vaguely aware, if aware at all, of the wonders of the world wide web.  Remember PlanetAll, for example, an online datebook service Amazon acquired back when PDAs weren't ubiquitous? I remembered, but vaguely, once Marcus jogged my memory. Reading Amazonia, then, is an experience akin to reminiscing with a rediscovered friend from grammar school.

As it happens, Rachel is also the estranged daughter of Democratic senator and presidential candidate Sedgewick Sexton, who is running against the incumbent on an anti-NASA platform. When NASA makes a (conveniently-timed) discovery of unparalleled importance deep in the Arctic circle, inside a three-hundred-foot-thick ice floe on the coast of Ellesmere Island, President Herney shrewdly recruits Rachel to corroborate the find and summarize the science behind it for his staff. Rachel's involvement in the project, however, which requires observation of the find in situ, plunges her into a nightmarish race for survival after she and a small band of civilian scientists stumble upon certain irregularities in NASA's evidence.<br /><br />Deception Point is yet another taut, intelligent thriller from the keyboard of Dan Brown, who, like his protagonist, excels at transforming complex information into digestible prose.

Harriet finds Anne, this \\"strange new mistress-person\\" she's become, wholly changed from the woman she knew in New York, smothering under the demands of an oppressive relationship with her Victor, a fastidious, subtly abusive, toeless Auschwitz survivor. In a journal addressed to--but not necessarily intended to be read by--her new boyfriend Benedict, Harriet chronicles the absurd and dark relationship she is forced to witness at close quarters. Happily, she is an excellent observer of minutiae and a witty reporter. Of a dinner out with the unhappy couple, for example, Harriet writes:<br /><br />\\"'I will take the steak,' Victor said to the waiter--rather imperiously, I thought. Why did it bother me so? I will take the steak. I have no toes, so I will not merely have, as others do, but I will take. I survived Auschwitz, so I can cheat on my wife and I will take the steak.\\"<br /><br />The first part of Katharine Weber's Objects in Mirror are Closer than they Appear, then, is epistolary, the stories of Anne and Harriet told by the latter in a series of lengthy, nicely written letters. In the remaining two-thirds of the book, related in third-person prose, Harriet's back story is fleshed out--her privileged but profoundly sad childhood, with its parallels to her current situation. Finally, the story returned to the present day, Anne's relationship with the enigmatic Victor meets its greatest challenge.<br /><br />Objects in Mirror are Closer than they Appear is a wonderful book, layered, poignant, and beautifully written, and it comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-06-20

Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe, in the last month before his fatal stabbing (in May of 1593), uncovers a smuggling operation and ruffles some highly placed feathers. And in our own century, private investigator/secret agent/quondam Renaissance scholar Kate Morgan is juggling two cases, one the attempted theft of a 400-year-old packet of intelligence documents from the safe of playboy Cidro Medina, and the other an 11-million-dollar payoff by art dealer Luca de Tolomei to an Iranian intelligence officer.<br /><br />Of the two interlaced stories, Kate Morgan's is the more engrossing. It is not so thrilling as to keep anyone up past bedtime, and the storyline which does prompt some concern for Kate's safety peters out disappointingly in the end. The flow of the primary tale, meanwhile, is disrupted by Marlowe's story, which punctuates Kate's in roughly alternating chapters. But The Intelligencer is worth the read because it is clever and because its principal character--Kate, not Marlowe--is so well-delineated and likeable. The secondary players in Kate's universe are intriguing as well: her secret agent boss with a classics degree from Princeton, her father the senator, her dead fiance. We can look forward to learning more about them in subsequent books, as Kate is evidently intended to anchor a new series: according to the jacket blurb, the author is currently at work on a second Kate Morgan novel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-06-17

The brains behind the charity tournament, and Cora's co-host, is the smug and pedantic crossword constructor Harvey Beerbaum, also a Bakerhaven resident. (How many professional cruciverbalists, one wonders, can one small town realistically boast of?) Throughout the book Harvey seems ever more interested in having Cora make a display of her puzzle-solving prowess, which leaves her suspicious: does Harvey know that Cora is only acting as the front for the Puzzle Lady operation, and that her niece Sherry is the talent of the outfit?<br /><br />Added to the personal dramas among the series' regulars is, of course, a rash of murders, all seemingly connected to the crossword tournament--just the thing to rouse Cora from her usual state of insobriety and set her sleuthing. Puzzled to Death is a decent addition to the Puzzle Lady books, offering a complex mystery as well as several puzzles for the reader to solve along with the book's principals. But it remains a shame that Cora, an otherwise intelligent and likeable character, is so unapologetically attached to her self-destructive habits. Clever and engaging on the page, she would in the real world have about her the stench of a habitual smoker, and the smoker's rasping cough and abbreviated life expectancy, and she would--if she were not currently involved in a murder investigation (and how often can a layman count on that unlikely distraction?)--very likely be plastered.

It's a difficult novel to pin down: Bourne Identity meets Memento meets St. Elsewhere meets...but if I told you the final element it would give away the biggest surprise in the book.<br /><br />The Charlie Monk to whose discrete charm the book's title refers is a highly trained government operative who works for an organization so secretive even he couldn't identify it. Given orders in clandestine meetings by his otherwise nameless master, Control, Charlie undertakes thrilling, James Bond-worthy missions--and in his off hours satisfies his Bond-sized appetites. Charlie is the perfect secret agent, focused single-mindedly on the task at hand, obedient, almost effortlessly lethal, and loyal, having been rescued by his current employers from an unpleasant childhood in an abusive orphanage. Charlie's memories of that period of his life are curiously indistinct, but that is something the book's other principal character can help him with: Dr. Susan Flemyng is a brilliant research scientist who specializes in the brain's retention of visual memories. She and Charlie cross paths repeatedly in the book.<br /><br />For the most part the writing in The Discrete Charm of Charlie Monk is transparent, as is appropriate in a book you want to speed read through. (I clocked in at just over 24 hours.) In a few action scenes, however, the narrative seems abbreviated, as if a paragraph or two were left out in the rush of describing dramatic events, and the reader is left confused about exactly what is happening. But it doesn't matter.

Married couple Nick and Jan--and their basset hound Al--move in to the second floor of a San Francisco house where, they discover, a silent screen actress by the name of Marion Marsh had once lived. (They find her name painted on the living room wall; hence the book's title.) Marion, a brash blonde with a penchant for risk-taking, had died in a car accident just before she would have made it big: Joan Crawford, in her first role, assumed the part Marion had been cast for and won the accolades that were due her predecessor. Cheated of this glowing future, Marion's ghost, as it turns out, wants to pursue her career in 1970's Hollywood, and she inhabits Jan's body, eventually with the latter's permission, with a view to making her come-back. But what will become of Jan, now that she's sharing her body with a wanton starlet? And how frequently will Nick cheat on his wife with his wife's body? The reader's curiosity about these and other questions may be sufficient to propel him or her to the book's finish line. But getting there is a long slog.<br /><br />Jack Finney, the author of, among other books, the science fiction classics Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Time and Again, is quite capable of writing compelling fiction. And Marion's Wall would have made a good short story. Unfortunately, the book is a short story's worth of material stretched out to fill a novel's worth of pages. The story has not been expanded, as might have been done, through the introduction of subplots and minor characters who make things more difficult for our protagonists. Rather, it was expanded through the accumulation of wholly unnecessary, mind-numbingly uninteresting description. Particularly in the last thirty or so pages of the book, the details come so thick and fast that one reads on just to see how many more inconsequential items the author can paint with such precision. A small example of this comes some twenty pages from the end, when Nick and Jan/Marion are let into a gate by an employee of the mansion they're calling at--a man whose only function in the story is to open that gate and who is never heard from again: \\"We heard a sound, a rattle, and a man on a bicycle was riding bumpily down the driveway toward us: youngish, bald, and wearing a kind of butler's uniform, though without a coat--black pants with a narrow white stripe down the sides, black and white horizontally striped vest, wing collar, bow tie.\\" Now imagine that virtually every object our heroes come across is described as precisely.<br /><br />If you want to know whether Jan ever gets her body back, or what it's like to bed the ghost of a 1920s starlet, then Marion's Wall is the book for you. But if you want to appreciate Jack Finney's writing and imagination, stick to the classics.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceample of this comes some twenty pages from the end, when Nick and Jan/Marion are let into a gate by an employee of the mansion they're calling at--a man whose only function in the story is to open that gate and who is never heard from again: \\"We heard a sound, a rattle, and a man on a bicycle was riding bumpily down the driveway toward us: youngish, bald, and wearing a kind of butler's uniform, though without a coat--black pants with a narrow white stripe down the sides, black and white horizontally striped vest, wing collar, bow tie.\\" Now imagine that virtually every object our heroes come across is described as precisely.<br /><br />If you want to know whether Jan ever gets her body back, or what it's like to bed the ghost of a 1920s starlet, then Marion's Wall is the book for you.

Rhodes considers both modern and ancient attitudes toward democracy, particularly the radical Athenian democracy of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Rhodes discusses the various approaches classical scholars have adopted in their study of democracy. Historians range from those who \\"in their own eyes if not in their critics' keep the effect of their ideology on their scholarship to a minimum, to those who are ideologically committed and proud of it; from those who seek correct answers to factual questions, to those who seek to penetrate the mentalite of the actors in the drama; from those whose notion of relevance is that history makes us aware of problems and of possible responses to them, and helps us to understand how we arrived where we are now, to those who seek in the past definite models and lessons for the present; from those who believe that we cannot make of history whatever we like, to those who think that we cannot do anything but make of history whatever we like.\\" He concludes that historians who are on \\"the objective and dispassionate end of the spectrum\\" are \\"likely to do better history.\\"<br /><br />Rhodes' short book presupposes too much knowledge on the part of its audience--about the ancient world and about classical scholarship--to be of interest to the general reader. But the overview he provides of some 200 years of scholarship on ancient democracies and \\"constitutional antiquities\\" would be a handy introduction to the subject for undergraduate and graduate students.<br /><br />Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)	2004-05-19

Principal among those at work on the exposition was chief architect Daniel Hudson Burnham, who did a yeoman's job in overseeing the minutiae of the construction. Prominent also was the nitpicking landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead, who already had on his resume the design and construction of New York's Central Park.<br /><br />People flocked to Chicago while the Fair was being prepared: able-bodied men who were looking for sure work in a period of economic depression; young women leaving home for the first time to seek employment as secretaries or teachers. Chicago may have been a dangerous place--fires alone took a dozen lives a day in the city--and it was aesthetically unappetizing, \\"a world of clamor, smoke, and steam, refulgent with the scents of murdered cattle and pigs.\\" But Chicago, particularly during the period of the Fair's construction, offered opportunity.<br /><br />One man, for example, the handsome and blue-eyed and oddly magnetic Mr. H.H. Holmes, discovered that the influx of young naifs to Chicago provided him with a surfeit of prospective \\"material.\\" That is, with a great number of young women, newly uprooted from their families, renting rooms in the hotel he had constructed near the Fair grounds, it became a simple matter for Holmes to find women he could murder and either cremate in his home-made kiln or flay and have turned into articulated skeletons. Late-19th-century Chicago was indeed a place where dreams could come true.<br /><br />In The Devil in the White City, author Erik Larson weaves together the story of the Fair's construction and an account of Holmes's criminal career. (The man's villainy, though manifest throughout, becomes a visceral thing only near the book's end.) Both halves of the tale are fascinating. In addition to being (pleasantly?) repulsed by the grotesqueries detailed, readers will come away from the book having learned an enormous amount about the Fair and its background. (The mark the Fair left on American society is still in evidence: the Ferris Wheel and Shredded Wheat both had their start at the exposition; readers may not know that we also owe to the Fair that little ditty that's played as background music in movies with Middle Eastern snake-charming-type scenes.) My only criticism is that Larson sometimes provides too much detail. He thrice provides the menus of banquets attended by the principals, for example. Otherwise, a rewarding read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceof the tale are fascinating.

(Sherry writes a popular syndicated crossword puzzle column, but the puzzles are attributed to her aunt, who is the public face of the \\"Puzzle Lady.\\") It turns out that the recently deceased Emma Hurley has stipulated in her will that her prospective heirs undergo a sort of trial-by-puzzle to determine which of the lot will wind up with the largest share of her multi-million-dollar estate. Cora Felton, meanwhile, because of her reputed prowess as a puzzle solver, is named judge of the contest, a highly lucrative if unlikely assignment. As the various greedy and unpleasant heirs discover, Emma Hurley's millions seem to be riding on the successful completion of a crossword. The puzzle is relatively straightforward--suspiciously so, considering the sums involved--but the mystery surrounding the Hurley will is far more complex than any of the principals--the innocent ones, at least--suppose. Before the puzzle ladies can solve the mystery, two corpses, their murders somehow connected to the crossword contest, join Emma's in the local cemetery.<br /><br />Parnell Hall's mysteries are complex enough to keep readers guessing and written with sufficient wit to keep them appreciative. (\\"Beasley's trip up the stairs was perilous at best. While he did not actually crawl, he did not actually walk, either.\\") The relationship between Cora and her niece in particular makes for pleasant reading. Hall might tone down Cora's self-destructive tendencies, however: that the grandmaternal \\"Puzzle Lady\\" is in reality so unlike her public persona is the principal joke of the series, but one worries about the effect of excessive smoking and drinking on her health. These are not charming or inherently amusing habits. One may note that Colin Dexter's Detective Morse likewise drinks to excess, but Morse's problems with alcohol are not, I think, milked for humor. Perhaps rather for pathos.<br /><br />Crossword lovers and cozy fans--and readers of the Nero Blanc series of crossword mysteries in particular--will enjoy Hall's take on the amateur sleuth genre.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecenks to excess, but Morse's problems with alcohol are not, I think, milked for humor.

Griet's responsibilities in the house are legion, and her tasks rendered more difficult by the unkindness of several of her new home's inhabitants. When Vermeer adopts her as an assistant in his studio--and subsequently determines to paint her--interpersonal relations below stairs are only worsened.<br /><br />Tracy Chevalier has written a believable and moving account--or imagining--of the creation of Vermeer's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" the painting which graces the cover of the paperback. The genius of the book lies in Chevalier's investing the act of painting Griet with a dark significance one would not imagine it to possess. There is in Griet's modeling for Vermeer the potential for tragedy, and in the painter's final brushstrokes a form of abuse. Communicating this significance to readers--and imagining this history of the painting in the first place--is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-05-02

Asked to paraphrase the first sentence of the Declaration of Independence, for example, one of the author's students writes: \\"It doesn't matter where you came from. In the end we are all human beings. Humans are at the top of the food chain, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't respect nature. Because we have one earth, learn to preserve it.\\"<br /><br />The purpose of grammar, Mulroy explains, is twofold: \\"It preserves and perfects understanding of the great literature of the past, and it contributes to eloquent self-expression.\\" He argues persuasively for a return to a concentration on formal grammatical instruction in schools, not out of some school-marmish obsession with sentence-ending prepositions or the like, but because grammar is a foundation for further understanding: \\"Intellectuals work with words. Questioning the value of basic grammar is like asking whether farmers should know the names of their crops and animals.\\" He points out, too, what most of us probably take for granted, that the world benefits enormously from the existence of a standard English, which grammatical instruction helps maintain: speakers of English across the globe can communicate with one another easily, which was not true of English speakers mere villages apart in the medieval period.<br /><br />Mulroy hits on a number of topics in his short book, among them the ancient liberal arts curriculum, the history of the classification of words into eight basic categories, educational practices in the middle ages, and progressive education. Happily, he also includes a section on sentence diagramming. This allowed me to pass a pleasant half hour diagramming sentences with my eight-year-old: intrigued by the game at first, she came to think me unusual in my interests, and facetiously suggested we try subtracting for pleasure next. She may mock, but then she's not likely to wind up thinking the Declaration of Independence was an early-American plea for nature preserves.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeces into eight basic categories, educational practices in the middle ages, and progressive education.

(Sullivan had been trying to trap a rat in his alley in the early morning of September 11th, 2001.) The alley he selected is bounded by a Chinese restaurant on one side and an Irish pub on the other, so that its greasy-slick cobblestones are awash nightly in edible garbage of both ethnic varieties, palatable to aficionados of either type. The alley is, in short, the perfect place to raise children.<br /><br />Rats, as it happens, have a lot of children to raise. Among the skin-crawlingly fascinating bits of information Sullivan provides in his highly readable paean to the Rattus norvegicus, or brown rat, is that both male and female rats can have sex twenty times a day. \\"If they are not eating, then rats are usually having sex. Most likely, if you are in New York while you are reading this sentence or even in any other major city in America, then you are in proximity to two or more rats having sex.\\" Nor is their copulation unproductive: \\"One rat's nest can turn into a rat colony of fifty rats in six months. One pair of rats has the potential of 15,000 descendants in a year.\\"<br /><br />Sullivan's observations on rats in general and on the rats in his alley in particular are interspersed with rat-related asides. He includes in his book, for example, chapters on New York's rat-motivated rent strikes in the 1960s and the rat fights of the 19th century, in which single dogs--and more rarely men--were pitted against scores of rats at a time for the amusement of a human audience. Some of Sullivan's tangents are more interesting than others, and readers will differ in their preferences. (The anecdotes of rat-hardened exterminators or urine baths as precaution against the Black Death? There is something here for every taste.) And Sullivan sometimes gets carried away with his poeticizing of the rat's experience and relationship to man. (I mean, they're just rats.) The book as a whole, however, is a delightful look at a rarely-considered world that is, often quite literally, right beneath our feet.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greececaution against the Black Death?

Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened in the middle of the night and confronted with evidence of something he hadn't thought possible: the Illuminati, the world's oldest satanic cult, though long thought a defunct organization, is apparently thriving and responsible for the horrific mutilation and murder of a brilliant physicist. Arrived at the victim's workplace, a secretive nuclear research facility in Switzerland, Langdon discovers that the Illuminati have more in store for the world than the assassination of a single scientist. The group has its hands on the world's most destructive material, stolen from the dead man's lab, and is intent on destroying the Catholic Church by violent means.<br /><br />Angels & Demons is the precursor to Dan Brown's much ballyhooed The DaVinci Code, which also features Langdon in the Indiana Jones-ish role of studly-smart professor-hero. The book is similar to The DaVinci Code, too, in its style and content--a romantic flirtation in the midst of crisis; secret religious history unveiled; complicated information rendered highly digestible by Mr. Brown's skillful hand; short, explosive chapters that make the book very hard to put down.

Indeed, given her druthers, Truss would arm the citizenry--that portion of it, at least, that takes its punctuation very seriously--with permanent markers. Truss's plea for violent action in the face of mixed up itses may go unheeded, but her light-hearted, best-selling paean to punctuation, originally published in Great Britain (and retaining British punctuation practices), has clearly tapped into a vein of previously voiceless pedants who believe that the lives of punctuation marks are worth celebrating. Evidently, as Truss writes, \\"a lot of well-educated sensitive people really have been weeping friendlessly in caves for the past few years, praying for someone--anyone--to write a book about punctuation with a panda on the cover.\\"<br /><br />Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a breezy, funny account of the history, abuse, and proper use of a host of punctuation marks--the apostrophe (with which the author's affections clearly lie), the comma, the semi-colon (failure to use which was, according to George Bernard Shaw, \\"a symptom of mental defectiveness\\"), the exclamation point (among punctuation marks \\"the big attention-deficit brother who gets over-excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly\\"), and so on.

Arguably the most stubbornly wrongheaded man in the economically depressed village of North Bath, New York, Sully scrapes a living as a jack of all trades, often fed construction work by the town's most fortunate scion, Carl Roebuck. Roebuck, a man with the sexual appetite of a satyr, enjoys an amusing love-hate relationship with Sully, the product of a lifetime of acquaintance in a small town. Richard Russo's Nobody's Fool abounds in these rich relationships, fully-formed characters sharing complex, realistic histories with one another. Chief among those characters is Sully's landlady and one-time 8th-grade teacher, 80-year-old Beryl Peoples, who has been Sully's staunch ally for more than forty years.<br /><br />Nobody's Fool is a chronicle of one particularly trying period in Sully's life, during which he is plagued by a grotesquely swollen knee and by unusually vivid reminiscences of his abusive father, now dead. (\\"Sully hated to think of his father at rest, and had there been a way, and if Sully'd had the money, he'd have left instructions to have Big Jim dug up every decade or so, just to make sure he didn't get comfortable.\\") The book is beautifully written, and Russo's evocation of North Bath is so successful that the town and its strange-looking denizens will come to reside in your imagination.

He manages almost at once to stir up long-moldering racial tensions in the small town with a chance remark he makes to an ambitious and unusually persuasive journalist, the braless insubstantially shirted Caitlin Masters. Penn soon finds himself investigating the thirty-year-old murder he had mouthed off about, but many people--among them the director of the FBI and Natchez's most fearsome resident, the corrupt Judge Leo Marston--would prefer that the 1968 car bombing of black factory worker Del Payton remain unsolved.<br /><br />The plot of Greg Iles's The Quiet Game is complex, and its principal characters are three dimensional, but the book did not pack the emotional wallop I expected of it after reading Iles's 24 Hours. It may be that the story is slowed down by unnecessary detail. For example, describing Penn's arrival at the site of the murder, the parking lot of a battery plant, Iles launches into a history of the factory: \\"The dark skeleton of the Triton Battery plant materializes to our right as Ike turns onto Gate Street, then right again into a parking lot lighted by the pink glow of mercury vapor. The Triton Battery Company came to Natchez in 1936 to build batteries for Pullman rail cars. In 1940 they retooled the line to manufacture batteries for diesel submarines. After the war it was truck batteries, marine batteries, whatever fit the changing market. The last I heard, Triton was using its ancient equipment to produce motorcycle batteries for European manufacturers.\\" But while slower than it might be and longer than it perhaps should be, The Quiet Game remains a decent read.

While Paul isn't interested in self-mutilation, he does make an unusual demand of the house whose multi-million-dollar offer he's decided to accept: Mackenzie-Haack must drop one of its most valued authors--Ned Isaly, a better writer than Paul who sells far fewer books--as a prerequisite to signing Giverney. Unfortunately for Ned, \\"Mack-Haack\\" is not in a position to rip up his contract. It's far easier for the publisher to hire a pair of hit men to take Isaly out--thugs who turn out to be more discerning than your average performers of \\"wet work.\\"<br /><br />Foul Matter follows the sometimes comic results of Mackenzie-Haack's determination to sign Paul Giverney, and it follows Ned Isaly and his writer friends as they struggle variously with their novels. The book's premise, if implausible, is intriguing. Unfortunately, the book seems to be short a chapter or two. Grimes does finally answer the question readers have been asking themselves since the book's first chapter--why is Giverney gunning for Isaly?--although the payoff isn't really worth it. But the author leaves unanswered a more important question about Ned that develops in the book's course. Ultimately, then, Foul Matter is an unsatisfying read, though there is some fun to be had along the way.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-03-29

With his already failing marriage and, more importantly, his position at the University on the line, Chaney turns for help to Carlotta Carlyle, a private investigator and part-time cabby and the protagonist of nine previous mysteries by Linda Barnes. Carlotta, a likeable enough character, calls on a variety of friends--boyfriends and cabbies and web-savvy tenants--for help in identifying and stopping the blackmailer. It is a simple enough assignment, but as it happens, blackmail is only the most obvious element of a more complex latticework of crimes.<br /><br />The mystery of Deep Pockets is reasonably satisfying, but the book as a whole never fully engaged me. That is, I never cared very much about any of the characters--Wilson Chaney in particular was never more than two-dimensional--nor was I ever made to sit on the edge of my seat while the plot advanced. Barnes' writing is transparent, which is okay, but the prose thus does nothing to raise the book from an okay read to a more memorable reading experience.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-03-16

Some of Daniel's peculiarities merely make his life difficult, such as his need for the aggregate wattage of lit lightbulbs in his apartment to equal precisely 1125 at all times. But others virtually preclude normal conduct. Most awkward, perhaps, is Daniel's inability to step over curbs: he can only cross a street when two scooped-out driveways lie directly opposite one another. This requirement makes an adventure of Daniel's frequent trips to the local Rite Aid, and it complicates his attempts to woo the real estate agent showing apartments across the street from his own.<br /><br />Steve Martin's chronicle of Daniel's self-imprisonment, narrated by Daniel himself, is a sweet story filled with often gorgeous prose. Martin's writing is both delightfully precise (\\"Let me tell you about my mailbox. It is one of twelve eroded brassy slots at the front entrance of my building.\\") and quietly funny: \\"I never have interfered with a relationship, out of respect for the guy as much as for myself, but Brian is a dope and Philipa is a sylph and I am a man, even if that description of myself is qualified by my failure to be able to cross the street at the curb.\\" The Pleasure of My Company is a quick read--163 pages and chapterless, with an ending that is perhaps too abrupt--and it is well worth a look. You'll leave the book appreciating, quite possibly madly envious of, its Renaissance-man author's highly re-readable prose style.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-03-10

In Keeping Watch, Allen's character and history are fully fleshed out, from the experiences in Vietnam that ineradicably imprinted themselves on him, to the mission he undertook after the War as a means of quelling his demons: Allen has spent more than 25 years applying his jungle survival skills to the task of rescuing abused children and wives from their abusers, usually by illicit means. When the action of Keeping Watch begins, Allen is in his mid-fifties and is about to retire from the field, but one final case requires his attention first: twelve-year-old Jamie O'Connell lives in terror of his father, whose casual abuse and cruel manipulations have warped the boy beyond measure.<br /><br />King's exploration of Allen's character is wholly successful, and her depiction of his patrols in the \\"green\\" in Vietnam riveting. The contemporary story of Jamie's rescue is equally rewarding, indeed downright engrossing after about page 240, when of a sudden one stops knowing for certain who the bad guys are. Keeping Watch is at least as good as King's novel Folly. Familiarity with the earlier book is not at all necessary, but readers of Keeping Watch will almost certainly want to treat themselves to a broader view of the universe Allen Carmichael inhabits once they've finished with King's latest.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-03-08

When the book begins, Ned Maddstone, the seventeen-year-old son of a Tory MP, is bound for Oxford and, almost certainly, for a life marked by as much success as he has already enjoyed: a cricket-playing future Head Boy and member of a sailing club, Ned is polite and good looking and newly in love, and he has the easy grace that comes with aristocracy. He would never dream of offending, but in his unselfconscious perfection Ned manages to do just that, and he consequently falls victim to a plot hatched by three jealous acquaintances.<br /><br />Though Fry's plot will not surprise, his reworking of the Dumas classic is cleverly done. Loyal Bonapartists have become IRA sympathizers, and treasures are now hoarded in Swiss bank accounts. Most charmingly, in the latter part of the book Ned is released into a gadgetized world that has been altered beyond measure by the computer revolution, reminding us of just how much our own lives have changed since 1980.<br /><br />Fry's book is a good read, though the animosity Ned unwittingly provokes in his acquaintances seems unrealistically ferocious. (I do not know whether this might be said also of the original.) Readers who do not know what to expect of the book are likely in particular to enjoy it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-03-02

After hugging the dog for precisely four minutes, and after being accused of the animal's murder by its distraught, pajama'd owner, Christopher determines to investigate the mystery of the canicide. What makes this task particularly challenging, however, and what sets this book apart, is that Christopher is autistic. Though he is able to communicate and he is unusually intelligent, Christopher's disorder renders simple activities--talking to strangers, traveling by public transportation--often prohibitively difficult. (Christopher cannot interpret facial expressions well, he cannot abide being touched, and his moods are governed by the colors of the cars he sees en route to school. But he excels at math and science and can, for example, rattle off a list of prime numbers up to 7,057.)<br /><br />In addition to undertaking to solve the dog's murder, Christopher writes down the story of his investigation in the form of a novel--The Curious Incident itself--a book whose sparse but highly readable prose ends up being about far more than a single dog's death. In passages alternating between real-life events and Christopher's scientific and mathematical musings, the curious incident of the pitchfork-pierced dog is explained, further deceptions are revealed, and the reader is introduced to an extraordinary mind.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-02-23

The small town's police force is not accustomed to murder investigations, and when a young woman turns up dead in the cemetery with what appears to be a crossword clue in her pocket, the police chief naturally turns to the town's resident cruciverbalist for expert opinion. He gets more than he bargains for, as the bibulous Cora is eager to investigate the case herself.<br /><br />Parnell Hall's A Clue for the Puzzle Lady, the first in a series of Puzzle Lady mysteries, is well worth the read. The cozy novel offers a decent mystery that should keep readers guessing (assuming they don't make the mistake of completing the crossword puzzle that accompanies the text prior to reading the book!), as well as a number of likeable secondary characters and, most importantly, an unusual and comic relationship between the book's protagonists, the \\"Puzzle Lady\\" and her often exasperated and always linguistically adept niece.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-02-17

But beneath the attitude, the boys are surprisingly thoughtful and nobly loyal to one another, and Mark, at least, is intelligent, capable of using \\"dyad\\" in a sentence: \\"'Look, there's another cop!' Mark said. 'They come in, like, dyads.'\\" His intellect is a plus, since Mark has a lot to figure out in Peter Straub's tense and exceedingly creepy--don't read it if you're alone in the house creepy--lost boy lost girl.<br /><br />After his mother's suicide (an instance of overkill, as it were, as the method she adopted was thrice effective), Mark's attempts to understand what happened to her land him in the thick of a family mystery and on the trail of a serial killer or two. His obsession leads Mark in particular to investigate an abandoned property directly behind his own house, a building every bit as creepy as Norman Bates's Victorian manse. The creepy goings-on in the house will have you almost screaming at Mark to get the hell out of there.<br /><br />Part murder mystery, part ghost story, the book is actually diminished by its spectral nonsense, which renders the story less genuinely scary. The book's ending in particular is too unbelievable to be satisfying. Straub's novel nonetheless is well worth the read.

In fact, Romand had never finished medical school, and he spent his days reading newspapers in cafes or taking walks in the woods. He supported himself and his family on money he swindled from friends and relatives, trusting souls who, incredibly, rarely asked about the status of the considerable sums Romand had allegedly invested for them.<br /><br />Romand's story might be just bizarrely amusing--a French variation of the life of deceit adopted by Leonardo DiCaprio's character in Catch Me If You Can, albeit with a less clever protagonist--were it not for what happened next. When Romand's deceit was likely to be uncovered--he had drained dry the well of his acquaintances' bank accounts--he murdered his wife and his parents, his five-year-old son and his daughter, and he tried, but only half-heartedly, to kill himself.<br /><br />As the first sentence of Carr&egrave;re's book suggests, the author periodically interjects his own experiences and responses into his narrative. He is clearly concerned with separating himself from the small \\"club\\" of Jean-Claude's devotees, Christian prison visitors who have come to admire the murderer in his new role as repentant sinner, the anguished prisoner who has found God and, condemned to life, assumes his suffering as some sort of expiation for his crimes. Carr&egrave;re is rightly appalled--at least to an extent--by these do-gooders, and he does manage to succeed, I think, in distancing himself from them. The author is decidedly not an apologist for Romand.

As Unsworth tells it, the assembled Greeks are growing increasingly contentious with the delay, and some remedy is required. The man with a plan, naturally enough, is wily Odysseus--star of Homer's Odyssey--here presented as a Machiavellian manipulator of words and men. Charmingly enough, he is wont to affect being lost for a word, and he compliments whoever supplies him with one with a very British sounding \\"Brilliant!\\"<br /><br />Also on hand are those sons of Atreus, Agamemnon--the commander-in-chief of the operation, from whom a sacrifice is allegedly demanded by Zeus if the ships are ever to get underway--and Menelaus, wronged husband of Helen. You will remember that Helen was spirited away from her home by the Trojan prince Paris, the offense which was the direct cause of the Trojan War (her face launching a thousand ships and all that). Unsworth's Menelaus is a comical buffoon who can't wrap his mind around the possibility that Helen may have run off willingly: \\"Must I remind you that my Helen is currently in a Trojan dungeon, being violated on an hourly basis? And I've told you before, she wasn't seduced, she was kidnapped.\\"<br /><br />As the story goes, Agamemnon sends for his daughter Iphigeneia to come to the fleet at Aulis--I shan't tell you why. Thus we have, in the second part of the book, a glimpse of the princess's life at Mycenae. There one evening she tells her slave Sisipyla the story of her family's proud history of incestuous cannibalism: how her great-grandfather Pelops was mashed into a tantalizing stew by his father Tantalus and served to the gods (he got better), and how her grandfather Atreus in turn butchered his brother's three sons and served them up to their father. Sisipyla, hearing the story and thinking to comfort Iphigeneia, who seems strangely affected by the telling of her family's exploits, says, \\"It's always the children who suffer, isn't it?\\" A great line.<br /><br />Unsworth's prose, as you've probably already noticed, is less stilted than one often finds in historical novels, for which I applaud it, though it is admittedly an odd experience to hear his loin-girded characters speak of \\"collateral damage,\\" or to hear Agamemnon's scribe say of the hero Palamades, \\"[H]is father was one of that band of heroes who sailed with Jason on the Argo in the quest for the Golden Fleece. That's the sort of thing that is bound to look impressive on a person's CV.\\"<br /><br />Readers who are already familiar with the story of Iphigeneia at Aulis will know more or less how Unsworth's story goes.

Like your more successful gamblers, he knows that walking away from the table when you're ahead is usually the best policy. For five years he has supported himself and his collaborators with his patiently-won earnings, the produce from his kidnappings--only one perfectly planned abduction per year--of the young children of well-to-do doctors. His crimes are so well thought out that Hickey knows his victims will neither attack him nor call the police, either during the kidnapping or after their children's safe return. He is confident enough in his planning that he uses his real name--rubbing his victims' noses in their impotence--and is unconcerned if they happen to have access to firearms. The distraught parents of Hickey's targeted children bend to his will--a rather unpleasant business given his demands--because they have to.<br /><br />Hickey's sixth kidnapping, of five-year-old juvenile diabetic Abby Jennings, is the subject of Greg Iles' taut, perfectly plotted, utterly gripping 24 Hours.

Foster fingered Joe Klein as the culprit using a method he had first applied in his doctoral dissertation to \\"A Funeral Elegy,\\" a 17th-century poem that was written by a certain \\"W.S.\\" after the death by homicide of William Peter of Exeter. Foster determined that the W.S. in question was in fact William Shakespeare.<br /><br />Foster's method of attributional detection involves examining the internal evidence of \\"questioned documents\\"--the vocabulary, orthography, spelling, and punctuation used by the author--and comparing his findings to the known writings of some finite number of likely suspects. Writers leave their marks on manuscripts unconsciously, Foster explains, as surely as gloveless burglars leave their fingerprints, their identities betrayed in their phrasing and word choice, in the body of authors whose styles they unwittingly emulate, in their commas and ampersands.<br /><br />Foster's Shakespearian bombshell landed him on the front page of the New York Times early in 1996. His celebrity resulted in this mild-mannered English professor being called upon to apply his attributional techniques to a great many other cases, some of them headline-making, in which the authorship of an important document was in question. In his fascinating book Author Unknown Foster discusses six of the cases in which he has been involved, from his investigation of the Unabomber's literary produce after Ted Kaczynski's arrest, to a study of the Talking Points document Monica Lewinsky once handed Linda Tripp, to a debate about who really wrote \\"The Night Before Christmas.\\" You think the man responsible for jollying up Saint Nick and transforming Christmas into a wretched holiday for the rapacious was Clement Clarke Moore, that birchen-rod-loving Biblical scholar who hated dance and song and noise and all things fun but wasn't above taking credit where it wasn't due?

It isn't. The envelope contains a typewritten letter, only one paragraph long: \\"There is a body buried on your property,\\" he reads, \\"covered in your blood.\\" Thomas is directed to dig up the mouldering corpse and retrieve something from the dead woman's pocket. If he doesn't, whoever wrote the letter will feed information to the police that incriminates Thomas. A bad end to a productive day, but things get much worse for our hero from here.<br /><br />Desert Places starts with a bang and doesn't let up for the next hundred-odd pages, at which point there is a section break and the reader can start breathing again, check his or her pulse, and assess the likelihood that the closet door is ajar because a psychopath is hiding behind it with a serated knife.

She is still alive, if barely, and the fastest of the students, Alex Gilbey, runs off through the blinding snow to find help. He eventually staggers up to a police car, covered himself in Rosie's blood and soaked in sweat, looking, he is uncomfortably aware, more like a man guilty of murder than a respectable citizen reporting a crime. Sure enough, in the absence of other suspects, Gilbey and his friends, the self-styled \\"Laddies fi' Kirkcaldy,\\" are suspected of the murder--Rosie dies shortly after the boys find her--though definitive proof of their guilt is never uncovered.<br /><br />The murder investigation of 1978 and its repercussions for the four students are the subject of the first part of The Distant Echo. The second part opens twenty-five years later, when Rosie's murder is reinvestigated as part of a cold case review. Modern forensic techniques such as DNA analysis will, it is to be hoped, finally exonerate Gilbey and his friends and bring the real killer to light. But, of course, things don't go as smoothly as one would like for the Laddies fi' Kirkcaldy....<br /><br />It is a measure of McDermid's success that one cannot be at all confident about the identity of Rosie's killer until it is revealed at the book's end. Until then even the unlikeliest of suspects seem as if they just might have committed the crime. The Distant Echo is tense--I read the last 120 pages or so in one sitting, it being impossible not to do so--and its complex characters well drawn. I am not convinced that in the end the motivation of the killer makes perfect sense, but my niggling doubts are far outweighed by my appreciation of the good read McDermid has given us.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-01-14

I'm not saying such methods don't work--what do I know--or that successful writers don't write that way--they probably do. But for *me*, even considering adopting such a regimen deadens any urge I might have to hit the keyboard.<br /><br />Marcia Golub's I'd Rather Be Writing, on the other hand, is the furthest thing from disheartening. The author offers practical advice about writing that the average mortal can imagine following--advice about note-taking and imposing deadlines on oneself and keeping numerous projects, in varying stages, going at once. The principal piece of advice one comes away from the book with, however, is a simple one, that if you want to be a writer, you have to sit down every day--or as close to every day as you can--and write *something* for some length of time. This is not earth-shattering information, of course, and indeed none of what Golub has to say is particularly profound. Nor did it have to be said at such length. The book could probably get the same information across in half the pages.<br /><br />But that wouldn't have been as much fun. Golub's writing is pleasingly breezy and occasionally funny. (\\"I know there are marriages where husband and wife both work at home. I also know there are marriages where husbands push wives out of windows and wives sprinkle arsenic on their husbands' bowls of pasta. I'm not saying the two are related, but you have to wonder.\\") She lets her personality and her life circumstances spill onto the page. She writes about her own work habits, descriptions of which for some reason always fascinate me. Most importantly, Golub somehow manages to be inspirational. She makes you want to follow her advice, to sit down and write *something*, both because you really want to and because, as she might say, death is just around the corner.

This year the cast of characters is expanded: Maddy and Peter, long married, have added a baby to the mix, and Sara's closest friend Adam, now a successful playwright, has brought along his uncommonly handsome new boyfriend Shawn. Their first evening at the house this year, Sara and Adam make an ice cream run. On the way back, a tub of soft-serve vanilla successfully secured from the local Fro-Z-Cone, Sara is killed in a car accident.<br /><br />Surrender, Dorothy is the story of the effect of Sara's death on this circle of friends and on her mother Natalie, Sara's life-long confidante, who joins the party at the beach for a weeks-long immersion in collective grief. While her characters bicker and mourn in this sometimes oppressive atmosphere, Wolitzer explores the network of their relationships, with one another and with Sara. While the subject matter of the book is of course sad, the final product is not unbearably so. Readers like myself who shy away from depressing novels need not fear this one.<br /><br />Wolitzer, meanwhile, as I discovered also when reading her novel The Wife, is capable of some very fine prose, rich in detail. Very often her descriptions are spot on, depicting in few words the essence of some banal item, for example, such as the \\"cool, dented metal surface\\" of the Fro-Z-Cone counter. Every now and then, however, Wolitzer's descriptions go too far, and the reader is distracted by some improbable comparison: \\"Then, during pushing, that two-hour period of time during which Maddy began to hallucinate a roll of theater tickets unspooling from her [body] [okay, that's a bit improbable too, but not what I'm talking about].<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient GreeceReviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2004-01-03

Chubb invented a deceased poet by the name of Bob McCorkle and passed off McCorkle's poetry--his own work, of course--on an unsuspecting editor whose ignorance Chubb wished to expose. (The story is based on a real-life literary hoax, the similar invention of a certain Ern Malley in the 1940s.) When he first appears in the story, Chubb's stint as literary hoaxer is long behind him. He is filthy and destitute and quite possibly mad, employed as a bicycle mechanic on a cramped street in Kuala Lumpur. He is discovered there by Sarah Wode-Douglass, the editor of a London poetry magazine, to whom Chubb spins out the unlikely story of his post-hoax life. Wode-Douglass in turn relates Chubb's story to us:<br /><br />The creature of Chubb's imagination, the fictional Bob McCorkle, was--or so Chubb was led to believe by the creature itself--given flesh by Chubb's pen. That is to say, someone who fit the description of Chubb's manufactured poet entered Chubb's life claiming to be the flesh-and-blood product of the hoaxer's fiction. Who or what this man is in fact is never fully explained. Whatever he is, the McCorkle creature endeavors, successfully, to destroy his alleged creator's life. The story of Chubb's ruin involves all manner of cruelties, but chief among them is McCorkle's kidnapping of Chubb's infant daughter, a crime which determines Chubb's unhappy future.<br /><br />The better part of *My Life as a Fake* is narrated by Chubb to Sarah Wode-Douglass. Within Chubb's narrative, moreover, are remembered conversations, sometimes lengthy stories, which Chubb now recounts. But while much of the book might justly have been encased in quotation marks, there is not a single such punctuation mark to be found in the text. The result is not as confusing as one might expect, though direct and indirect discourse blend together into an inseparable mass of speech. Chubb's language, meanwhile, is often difficult to understand, an Australian English tinged with the expressions and verbal tics of his adopted country.<br /><br />One reads the book increasingly curious to discover how Chubb came to be in his current situation, repairing bikes in Kuala Lumpur, but the read is not a wholly pleasant one. Chubb's' convoluted story is interesting, but its narration leaves one with numerous questions, not least of which involves the true nature and motivation of McCorkle.

Scott Fitzgerald's vomit. Reading the book is akin to the experience of overhearing the eclectic chatter of a cocktail party. There is a lot of talk about people and places and books and films one has never heard of: my one complaint about Baxter's book is that he spends too much time mentioning publishers or book sellers that can mean nothing to the average reader (though book collectors will doubtless relish the detail). But interspersed among the forgettable bits are some delightful passages that any neophyte reader can enjoy--Baxter's description of the eccentricities of movie theaters in the small-town Australia of his youth, or of book browsing in Parisian librairies, an activity quite unlike shopping in English or American bookshops:<br /><br />\\"The aristocratic attitude to bookselling meant that whole areas of Anglo-Saxon book-dealing expertise simply didn't apply. In visiting a librairie, you were paying a social call and admiring a collection. You were expected to walk appreciatively along the shelves, taking down books at random, admiring the bindings, rubbing a hand over the worn morocco, perhaps reading a few pages, nodding at a well-turned phrase, even smiling. Browsing, yes, but not as we know it.<br /><br />There is, too, for those interested in flayed humans, a catalogue of anthropodermically-bound books, and also a story about a certain Bea Miles--\\"smelly, dumpy but charismatic,\\"-- that is worthy of Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair: she \\"roamed Sydney, wearing a hand-lettered cardboard sign offering to recite Shakespeare for a shilling a time.\\" A Pound of Paper has many such anecdotes to offer readers.<br /><br />In the end, one does not leave Baxter's book feeling that one knows the author particularly well--he does not offer readers an intimate entree into his life.

Briephs is a scion of the local aristocracy, the son of imposing patrician Sara Briephs and the nephew of her brother, democratic senator Hal Crane. Briephs is also a bit of a loon. Eschewing his family's more traditionally tasteful lifestyle, Briephs lives alone on an island in a house that was built to his specifications, a labyrinthine, red-walled replica of an ancient Minoan palace. This is unlikely in the extreme, of course, but it does provide an excuse for numerous classical references in the book, including a quotation from Sophocles' Ajax: \\"Silence gives the proper grace to women.\\"<br /><br />The character quoting Sophocles with disapproval is a crossword editor herself, Thompson Briephs's counterpart in a rival newspaper. Anabelle Graham is beautiful and intelligent, capable of reciting a list of four-letter Greek goddesses even in trying circumstances, and she is, unfortunately for Rosco, married. As the solution of Briephs's murder depends on the solution of a series of crossword puzzles--anticipating his demise, Briephs left clues--Belle becomes involved with Rosco's investigation and interested in the private eye himself.<br /><br />Although The Crossword Mystery strains credibility in its description of Briephs's island home, the book is a good read, and the hesitant flirtation between Rosco and Belle is fun to watch. Crossword enthusiasts in particular will enjoy the book: it includes six puzzles for readers to solve along with Belle, among them Harrison Briephs's posthumous cryptics.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-12-22

Daniels has been called in to help locate an escaped patient, a certain Rachel Solando, who found herself in Ashecliffe after murdering her three children. How Rachel escaped is a mystery, though the fact that she managed to break out of a locked room and get past several manned checkpoints and a gaggle of poker-playing orderlies suggests that she had a lot of help.<br /><br />The fact of Rachel's escape is not the only strange thing about Teddy's new assignment. Rachel's doctor is also missing, having left for his vacation immediately after her escape. That he was allowed to leave is a serious breach of standard operating procedure in a lockdown, yet Ashecliffe's deputy warden and the hospital's Chief of Staff seem unconcerned. There is, too, the mystery of what really goes on at the hospital. Rumor has it that the doctors engage in horrific experimental surgeries, ice pick lobotomies on patients who are not anesthetized. Certainly it is suspicious that the old lighthouse, now allegedly functioning as a sewage treatment plant, is under heavy guard and is wrapped in electrified fencing.<br /><br />Reading Shutter Island, my review of the book writing itself in my head, I was going to say that the story is pretty good, if perhaps unbelievable in parts--the marshal's' mounting paranoia and this forbidding facility where creepy things happen, an island they can't leave until a ferry, delayed by a hurricane, returns for them. The book would, I thought, make a decent movie, perhaps a better movie than it is a book because--and this was my chief complaint--the dialogue between Teddy and Chuck is so terribly clunky.<br /><br />\\"They do it, and it's legal. Only humans get schizophrenia. It doesn't happen to rats or rabbits or cows. So how are you going to test cures for it?\\"<br /><br />\\"On humans.\\"<br /><br />\\"Give that man a cigar.\\"<br /><br />\\"A cigar that's just a cigar, though, right?\\" [groan]<br /><br />Teddy said, \\"If you like.\\"<br /><br />There are, in addition, some unbelievable dream sequences that annoyed me. Nobody talks--or nobody should talk--like Teddy and Chuck do, and nobody has dreams as vivid as Teddy has.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />But then I read the last fifty pages of the book--which went very fast indeed--and I forgave Lehane the dreams and the clunky dialogue because, I now think, they make sense given the plot.

The concluding paragraphs of each story--sometimes just the final sentence--inevitably offer the reader some kind of surprise, whether slight and easily swallowed (\\"A La Carte\\") or groan inducing (\\"Just Good Friends\\") or the product of a sort of dishonest storytelling that leaves one feeling ill treated (\\"The Perfect Murder\\"). Among the best of the lot are \\"A La Carte\\"--the story of a young man compelled by his father to delay entering his chosen profession--and \\"Honor among Thieves,\\" in which a wine connoisseur is put to the test by a \\"humbug.\\" But all of the stories (ten of them are reportedly based on actual events) are worth a read.

Some of the entries are amusing, for example Dillard's description of her weeks-long, late-night chess game with an unknown opponent who, she briefly thinks, just might be the diaper-clad but otherwise naked baby she finds hovering around the board one evening. But some of the entries are mere poetic, well, nonsense: \\"The line of words is a fiber optic, flexible as wire; it illumines the path just before its fragile tip. You probe with it, delicate as a worm.\\" The Writing Life cannot, I should think, be of any practical benefit to writers. And it is neither a \\"guidebook\\" nor a particularly inspiring piece of prose, however much the blurbists may rave.

The result is that he sometimes disappears from the present, leaving nothing but a pile of clothes behind him, and materializes stark naked in some other time and place. Without resources in his new time, Henry needs to survive by stealth and speed--stealing clothing and money, outrunning--or trying to outrun--the police, by whom he is frequently arrested.<br /><br />\\"[T]here are several outstanding warrants for my arrest: breaking and entering, shoplifting, resisting arrest, breaking arrest, trespassing, indecent exposure, robbery, und so weiter. From this one might deduce that I am a very inept criminal, but really the main problem is that it's so hard to be inconspicuous when you're naked\\"<br /><br />The adventures Henry has when chronologically displaced are alternately dangerous, or sorrowful, or life-changing. He sometimes visits himself in the past--and, similarly, is visited in the present by past and future selves. (His teenage selves engage in what must be a peculiarly effective form of auto-eroticism: Niffenegger has thought of everything.) He is made to repeatedly re-witness emotionally fraught incidents from his past. Principally, however, as its title suggests, The Time Traveler's Wife is the story of Henry's relationship with Clare, who so often finds herself waiting for her husband to return to her. This being a time travel book, Henry's relationship with Clare is not straightforward. They first meet when he is 36 and she is 6, and they meet again for the first time when Henry is 28 and Clare 20. The story of their life together is told from both of their points of view in brief, dated sections that chronicle Henry's jumps into and out of Clare's life.<br /><br />Given her premise, Niffenegger might have concentrated on the gee-whizness of Henry's condition, telling us in greater detail about the cool stuff that happens to Henry when he time travels (bumping into his parents during his own infancy, for example). But the author's account is rather a serious consideration of the practical effects of Henry's condition on his life: his unexplained absences from work (and his naked reappearances in the library's stacks), the dangers inherent in his driving or flying, the possibility of materializing in some life-threatening circumstance, the disruption to his family life, and so on. I would myself have enjoyed reading a bit more of the gee-whiz stuff--and less about the protagonists' dreams. And I would have liked to read about some of the more dangerous episodes in Henry's time-traveling career, the fight-or-flight situations to which Niffenegger only alludes. But quibbles aside, The Time Traveler's Wife is a very cleverly conceived and well-written book.

The authors of the forty-some pieces that comprise the volume are all celebrated writers (though I confess I was not familiar with all their bylines), a good many of them household names: Kurt Vonnegut and Alice Hoffman and John Updike and Scott Turow and so on. The authors were charged with writing about, well, writing, and they manage to do so, surprisingly enough, without ever stepping on one another's subject matter: each essayist approaches the topic in a manner peculiar to themselves.<br /><br />Some of the essays, those that had the least to do with the task of writing, left me cold: it is a shame that the collection, which is organized alphabetically by author, begins with a particularly weak contribution. But there are far more worthy essays than not in this volume. Among the most interesting of the lot are Kent Haruf's piece on the peculiar way that some writers, including himself, write, and David Leavitt's fascinating reminiscence of his early insistence on order in the unlikeliest of places: &#34;I didn't like it if there were more songs on one side [of a record] than the other; the songs had to be at least three minutes long, with a title that appeared in neither the first nor the last line. (If the title appeared in both the first and the last line, I would remove the offending album from my shelf.)&#34; Writing, Leavitt explains, was a means for him to impose order on ordinary life. There is, too, a very amusing piece by Ed McBain on crime writing, and David Mamet writes of the joys of genre fiction, and in particular of Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey-Maturin series (now a major motion picture!). Readers should find something to like in these pages, and may indeed discover among them a handful of new authors to add to their shelves.nt Greece	2003-11-29

There is also the occasional shock on offer, as when Nelson reveals that some people skip around in the books they read or, quelle horreur, stop reading them altogether before the last page.

For a number of years his wife Melinda has paraded a succession of lovers around their small town of Little Wesley, Massachusetts, dragging the men along to the Van Allens' dinner engagements with friends, dancing with them provocatively, entertaining them in night-long debauches in the Van Allens' home. Victor's friends shake their heads or offer him extra desserts at parties--pity food--and they marvel at his reaction to the insult: Victor is a paragon of patience. He allows Melinda her lovers, only wishing that she attracted a higher quality paramour. Still, Victor is not as unconcerned about Melinda's behavior as he appears. He regularly forces himself to stay awake and chaperone his wife's \\"dates\\" in their living room rather than please the couple by retiring to his separate bedroom. And, near the beginning of the novel, Victor announces to his wife's most recent flame that he once killed a lover of hers, a certain Malcolm McRae. Victor is lying, but McRae *had* been pummeled to death in his New York apartment, and his murderer had not been identified.<br /><br />This being a Patricia Highsmith novel, it cannot be a good thing for our put-upon protagonist to confess to a murder he did not commit, and the reader begins at once to wonder how this misstep of Victor's will lead to his undoing. But it is unlikely that readers will correctly anticipate precisely how Victor's story plays itself out.<br /><br />Patricia Highsmith--the author of, among many other novels, Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mister Ripley--is a master of suspense. Deep Water shares with her other books a certain remarkable slowness. Highsmith's characters unhurriedly attend to the minutiae of their lives. They entertain friends and admire artwork and do the gardening, they take drives and prepare supper. Very often it seems that nothing is happening in one of her books, and yet as the pages turn the reader becomes more and more tense, wondering when precisely the axe will fall--for it certainly will fall. By the end of Deep Water the pages turn very fast indeed.<br /><br />[Deep Water also shares with some of Highsmith's other novels (Found in the Street) a bizarre vision of parenthood. The Van Allens have a highly disposable daughter, perhaps eight years old, who spends her days in other people's homes, or playing contentedly by herself in her own room. She is sometimes left alone in the house. She is abandoned at the movies when her mother forgets to pick her up. Meanwhile the Van Allens' social calendar is chock full of late-night dinner parties and those uncomfortable threesomes in the living room. Part of this abuse of the daughter has to do with the storyline: Melinda is intended to be a very poor mother.

Clever, but just too much	Literary Detective Thursday Next is back in Lost in a Good Book, a sequel to last year's delightful The Eyre Affair. The series is set in an alternate universe in the mid-1980's, a world in which dodo birds and Neanderthals have been reengineered, where ChronoGuard detectives regularly surf through time, and where literature is taken *very* seriously indeed. As we learned in The Eyre Affair, some movement between the fictional and real worlds is possible: Thursday spent some time in Jane Eyre in the last book. In Lost in a Good Book there is a good deal more of this book jumping. Thursday lands in Kafka's The Trial, for example, as well as in Great Expectations, where a shabbily-dressed Miss Havisham--who's got a Sony Walkman stashed in her bureau and knows her way around a stick shift--has signed on to teach Thursday the finer points of book travel.<br /><br />What is most noteworthy about Lost in a Good Book, for both good and ill, is that it is filled to bursting with cleverness: because of some boundary changes, for example, the Cheshire Cat's name is now the Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat; Odysseus is in court on a charge of \\"Grievous Bodily Harm against Polyphemus the Cyclops\\"; parasitic adjectivores plague books by gobbling up descriptive terms while leaving nouns intact. And so on. It's all very clever, but several ingenious bits per page for some four hundred pages and one feels one could choke. It's just too much, as if Fforde has thrown every idea he had into this single volume--books with more pages than they could reasonably hold, a library containing all the books that ever have or will be written, communication between the fictive and real realms via footnote. (Sick of it yet?) As a result, the details of the book are highly forgettable, and one feels virtually no interest in the fate of the characters. Fforde should have stopped perhaps 150 pages earlier, before he had shot every bolt in his quiver, before the reader starts thinking, if he does not scream aloud, \\"Enough!\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecenot scream aloud, \\"Enough!\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-11-07

Diabolically funny and bittersweet, the book is, most impressively, very well written. I found myself repeatedly re-reading paragraphs to savor the language.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-11-05

Rae Newborn, an internationally famous woodworker, moves to a remote island to rebuild her great-uncle's house. Isolated and paranoid, with only a tenuous hold on sanity, Rae has the \\"skin-crawling feeling of being watched.\\" Well, just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean people aren't watching you. Laurie King's Folly is a beautifully written, rich psychological thriller.

All of the figures on whom Griesemer focuses are somehow involved, whether directly or indirectly, in the various attempts made during that period to lay the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. The book's principal character, to the extent that it has one, is Chester Ludlow, the chief engineer of the Atlantic Cable Company and the genius behind the paying-out mechanism that will, it is hoped, prevent the cable from breaking while it is unspooling. Chester's wife Franny, still grieving from the accidental death of their young daughter, and his fragile brother Otis are also central to the story.<br /><br />Griesemer's book, nearly 600 pages long, covers a lot of ground--not only the cable and the wave of progress of which it was a part, but also the Civil War and Lincoln's assassination, spiritualism, the stinking sewers of London, and the building of the world's largest ship (at the time), the Great Eastern. The book is a historical narrative, but it is not at all clear from the text how historically accurate it is, or which of the characters if any were historical figures. An author's note ought to be added to clarify matters.<br /><br />Griesemer's novel is not enthralling, or at least not obviously so. Indeed, it is downright slow at times. Yet perhaps two-thirds of the way through it becomes clear that the author has created a world, or described a world, that will have staying power in your imagination. The book does not demand your attention in the way that a thriller does, but it does, by the end, have a claim on you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-10-26

Susan Fletcher, brilliant mathematician/cryptographer, and her linguistically accomplished fiance David Becker are both caught up in a plot against the National Security Agency's secret--indeed, officially nonexistent--super computer. With the brute force of its three million processors, TRANSLTR is capable of breaking any code in an average of about six minutes. Or it  is, at least, until the action of the book begins, when TRANSLTR is fifteen hours into at attempt to crack a code its creator claims is unbreakable. The clock ticks loudly in this book as David, Susan, and other NSA employees work to break the code and/or discover its pass-key before the algorithm is made public and/or a computer worm destroys the security protecting the United States' most confidential information. Meanwhile, an assassin is dogging Becker's steps in Spain, an NSA employee may be in cahoots with the author of the code, and a zealous security guard is pushed to his death in the bowels of the super computer's housing.<br /><br />Some of the plot twists in Digital Fortress are predictable, but this hardly detracts from the book. Brown's debut novel is a riveting thriller you'll find hard to put down.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-10-15

The siblings are orphaned in the first book in the series: as they are later informed by the apparently well-meaning but ineffectual Mr. Poe, the executor of their parents' considerable estate, a terrible fire consumes the children's home one day while they are off at the beach. The circumstances of the fire are, one must conclude, highly suspicious.<br /><br />Mr. Poe's efforts to place the siblings with a guardian land them first in the squalid home of a distant relative, a uni-browed actor by the name of Count Olaf, who begins scheming at once to make off with the Baudelaire fortune. Olaf's villainous activity continues throughout the series and very often involves his employment of outlandish disguises which no one but the Baudelaires is capable of seeing through. (\\"Some people called this man wicked. Some called him facinorous, which is a fancy word for 'wicked.' But everyone called him Count Olaf, unless he was wearing one of his ridiculous disguises and making people call him a false name.\\") As Olaf's girlfriend puts it in The Slippery Slope, \\"money and personal satisfaction\\" make Olaf's relentless efforts to seize the Baudelaires' fortune worth the trouble: \\"Once we have our hands on the Baudelaire fortune, we'll have enough money to live a life of luxury and plan several more treacherous schemes!\\"<br /><br />Olaf's villainy is a constant throughout the series, and so is the author's linguistic playfulness--his clever aphorisms (\\"Taking one's chances is like taking a bath, because sometimes you end up feeling comfortable and warm, and sometimes there is something terrible lurking around that you cannot see until it is too late and you can do nothing  else but scream and cling to a plastic duck\\") ; his amusing verbal tics (\\"a phrase which here means...\\"). There are also hints throughout the series about the enigmatic, rarely photographed Snicket's curious life. References to his \\"pulling aside a bearskin rug in order to access a hidden trapdoor in the floor\\", for example, or to spending months on a mountain with \\"only a lantern and a rhyming dictionary for company\\" slip into the narrative. Snicket is evidently on the run--from whom it is not clear--and so he wisely employs as his legal, literary, and social representative a certain Daniel Handler, who is himself, as coincidence would have it, the author of novels for adults.<br /><br />I should confess that I am half in love with Mr. Snicket, and I would pledge myself to him eternally were it not for a previous commitment of my own and Lemony's apparent devotion to the deceased Beatrice, to whom he dedicates each of his books (for example, \\"To Beatrice--darling, dearest, dead\\"). But I *can* pledge myself to the task of promoting his research into the Baudelaires' lives, and urge you to buy Snicket's books, however filled with horrors they may be, and however much your possession of them may imperil you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceometimes there is something terrible lurking around that you cannot see until it is too late and you can do nothing  else but scream and cling to a plastic duck\\") ; his amusing verbal tics (\\"a phrase which here means...\\").

US	52923654	R2XFFKBKPAW1RX	0060931809	112419171	The Map That Changed the World	Books	3	16	17	N	N	A review of the book about the map that changed the world	Simon Winchester, the author of the deservedly best-selling  The Professor and the Madman, writes in The Map that Changed the World about William Smith, who was dubbed in 1831--a bit belatedly--The Father of English Geology by the then president of the Geological Society of London. Smith's great work was an enormous--some 8 x 6 feet--geological map of England, the data for which Smith had spent a considerable part of his lifetime collecting single-handedly. The map, which delineates in splendid color the various strata of rock that underlie England, was the first of its kind. Smith himself was a maverick intellect for his understanding of both the implications of the strata for the history of the Earth and the importance to the rocks' identification of the fossils that could be collected from them.<br /><br />Smith also had an interesting personal history in that his great efforts for science were so unremunerative that he landed for some eleven weeks at the age of fifty in one of London's great debtors' prisons. Winchester makes much of this great irony in his book, that a monumental figure should be so ill-treated and so long unrespected during his lifetime.<br /><br />For all Smith's merits as a subject, however, Winchester's narrative is a bit of a slog. His emphasis is very often on the science of geology rather than the personality of Smith. This is reasonable enough given the subject matter of the book, but I, at least, frequently found the author's discussion difficult to follow. Winchester may, as a one-time student of geology at Oxford, have had too high an opinion of his layman readers' capacities. (Or I, of course, may not have been the proper audience for the book.) For those who are not geologically inclined, there may be more discussion of strata, however, than is palatable: \\"Below the 300 feet of chalk, Smith declaimed before the others, were first 70 feet of sand. Then 30 feet of clay. Then 30 more feet of clay and stone. And 15 feet of clay. Then 10 feet of the first of named rocks, forest marble. And 60 feet of freestone.\\" And so on.<br /><br />Winchester's narrative does become more interesting toward the book's end, when Smith has, finally, published his map and he is imprisoned for debt--the great dramatic moment toward which the book has been leading. But Smith's stay in the King's Bench Prison is itself anticlimactic, because while Winchester alludes to its \\"horrors\\" earlier on, he finally describes debtors' prison as a sort of country club, where the indebted middle-class pass their time playing cards or bowling and drinking beer. Trying and embittering it may have been to be locked away while his possessions were riffled through and sold off, but it was evidently not horrific.<br /><br />Winchester's writing is at its most charming--and he does write charmingly--in the most personal section of the book, when he tells the story of his discovery at the age of six of an ammonite fossil. He and his fellow convent boys were led by the sisters of the Blessed Order of the Visitation on a miles-long walk to the sea, an expedition they undertook once a week. Winchester's account of the boys' riotous plunge into the sea shows just how nicely he can turn a phrase:<br /><br />\\"Up here there always seemed to be a cool onshore breeze blowing up and over the summit. It was tangy with salt and seaweed, and the way it cooled the perspiration was so blessed a feeling that we would race downhill into it with wing-wide arms, and it would muss our hair and tear at our uniform caps, and we would fly down toward the beach and to the surging Channel waves that chewed back and forth across the pebbles and the sand.<br /><br />\\"I seem to remember that by this point in the weekly expedition the dozen or so of us--all called by numbers, since the convent's peculiar regime forbade the use of names; I was simply 46--were well beyond caring what the nuns might think: The ocean was by now far too magnetic a temptation. Once in a while we might glance back at them as they stood, black and hooded like carrion crows, fingering their rosaries and muttering prayers or imprecations--but if they disapproved of us tearing off our gray uniforms and plunging headlong into the surf, so what? This was summer, here was the sea, and we were schoolboys--a combination of forces that even these storm troopers of the Blessed Visitation could not overwhelm.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps Winchester will one day expand on this passage with further autobiographical fare.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecele we might glance back at them as they stood, black and hooded like carrion crows, fingering their rosaries and muttering prayers or imprecations--but if they disapproved of us tearing off our gray uniforms and plunging headlong into the surf, so what?

The result is a captivating and well-written book, happily lacking the bland prose that one often finds in novels written for this age group: \\"'I can have a midlife crisis or a midlife monkey,' she [the protagonists' mother] announced on her fortieth birthday. 'I've decided to go for the monkey.'\\" (Gaspar's speech, often unusually formal--he is older than he looks--is particularly charming: \\"I must get to a lawyer immediately. They may be a vile species and the curse of humanity, but they're our only hope for the moment.\\") The Monsters of Morley Manor is a good book to read aloud, and its plot is intricate enough and the story serious enough in parts that it may prompt interesting discussions.

Richard Feynman, the Nobel  Prize-winning physicist who would later serve on the commission investigating the Challenger disaster (in 1986), asked his friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton whether he knew what had become of Tannu Tuva. Leighton had never heard of the place and suspected he was being set up, but the Encyclopedia Britannica confirmed its existence. Tannu Tuva was once an independent country, but it became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. When Feynman and Leighton learned that the capital of Tuva was Kyzyl--a city without any proper vowels in its name--they knew they had to go there: \\"A place that's spelled K-Y-Z-Y-L has just *got* to be interesting!\\"<br /><br />So began our heroes' eleven-year quest to reach Tuva, a more difficult project than you might imagine. Tuva, buried in the Asian heartland, was isolated, the Soviet Union was forbidding, and even basic information was hard to come by. (This quest, remember, was undertaken before the explosion of the internet. One catches oneself, when reading the book, thinking anachronistically about the task: why not just Google the place?) Eventually, of course, they learned an awful lot--about Tuvan throat-singing (my 1991 edition came with a 45!) and Kyzyl's main buildings, about Tuvan stone carvings and shamanism. And they communicated with Tuvans in Tuvan, using a Tuvan-Mongolian-Russian phrasebook that they turned into a Tuvan-Mongolian-Russian-English phrasebook.<br /><br />Leighton's account of their various attempts to reach Tuva can be confusing--lots of names to remember of contacts who may or may not have wound up aiding in the effort. It all gets a bit muddied. And there is not as much of Feynman in the book as one would like. Tuva or Bust is primarily an account of Leighton's role in the quest, with Feynman making brief appearances now and then. Still, it is good to be in the physicist's company, however briefly, and it is good to be reminded, by this quixotic project of his, of Feynman's joy in experience.<br /><br />Feynman fans, in short, will enjoy the book. Those who are not acquainted with him already, however, should become fans first by reading Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?

The plot of Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice is updated and plays itself out among the over-seventy crowd of Jewish retirees living it up in Boca Raton, Florida. Instead of a mother of five girls--Austen's Mrs. Bennett--doing her utmost to marry off her progeny, there is the hyper-organized and resourceful Carol, who sets the action of the book in motion by scheming to revitalize the social life of her widowed mother-in-law, May Newman.<br /><br />Cohen's story revolves around the friendship and love lives of May (think Austen's Jane Bennett) and her friends Florence (Elizabeth Bennett) and Lila, all of whom live in Boca Festa, one of Boca's myriad retirement communities. While the garrulous and crass Hy Marcus woos Lila, May and Florence enjoy relationships with Cohen's updated versions of Charles Bingley and Fitzwilliam Darcy, respectively Norman Grafstein and his surly friend Stan Jacobs. If you're familiar with the plot of Pride and Prejudice, you won't be surprised by the turns these relationships take.<br /><br />If you haven't read Austen's novel, however, don't panic: you don't have to know the plot of the original story to enjoy Cohen's reanimation of it. But you may have to be over sixty and Jewish. At least I'm assuming that the book will play better among readers who identify more than I with its characters. While I found May and Florence and their respective beaux likeable enough, and I enjoyed the foray into Florida's community of relatively well-to-do codgers, I found the book plodding and its dialogue often boring. The frequent references to the characters' Jewish identity, meanwhile, were irksome:<br /><br />\\"I feel like I'm seventeen, being whisked away to play hooky by the high-school quarterback,\\" said Flo, looking at Mel's handsome profile as they sped off.<br /><br />\\"No football, I'm afraid, swimming--the Jewish contact sport. I wanted to play football, only my mother wouldn't let me. I was too precious, she said. She held my price very high, you see, which spoiled me for hard labor.\\"<br /><br />\\"The standard recipe for the Jewish prince,\\" observed Flo. \\"But you seem to have accomplished a great deal, all things considered, and turned out better than most.\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of this sort of thing. If you care how Mel turned out in fact, and if you don't find the above snippet of dialogue dreadfully dull, by all means, read the book. I suspect that a lot of readers will in fact like it, and that my reaction to it is somehow aberrant, so I shan't stand in your way.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecewas too precious, she said.

The author tells the story of her own metamorphosis from independent entity to \\"motherbaby\\" unit in rough chronological order: from the alarmist literature of pregnancy, which \\"bristles with threats and the promise of reprisal\\" for expectant mothers who violate dietary prescriptions; to the propaganda of natural childbirth advocates (\\"Some women find birth the most intensely pleasurable experience of their lives\\"), those souls who maintain that a procedure akin to, say, squeezing a cantaloupe out of one's anus can be rendered nearly pain-free, indeed \\"pleasurable\\", by the simple adoption of an embarrassing breathing technique; to a mother's shocking, sudden immersion into an alien world of sleeplessness and isolation. (The immediacy of the metamorphosis is brought home to the author soon after she delivers her daughter by caesarian: \\"Do you want to try putting her to the breast? the midwife enquires as I am wheeled from the operating theatre. I look at her as if she has just asked me to make her a cup of tea, or tidy up the room a bit. I still inhabit that other world in which, after operations, people are pitied and looked after and left to recuperate.\\" )<br /><br />Cusk's account is a quick read, her prose very often elegant. She hits a number of nails squarely on the head--in her descriptions of the constant demands made on breastfeeding mothers, for example, or the drama and tension inherent in bringing a baby out into the public, or one's cautious anticipation of freedom when it looks like the kid may finally sleep. She talks about the parents' eventual containment in a single, safe room once the baby changes \\"from rucksack to escaped zoo animal,\\"  an alteration in lifestyle that expectant parents, reading the standard parenting books, would not likely anticipate. Cusk describes, perfectly, the \\"mess and endemic domestic chaos\\" of a child-occupied house, \\"which no amount of work appears to eradicate.\\"  And she details for the non-parent, wont to lie in of a Saturday morning, what weekends are like for parents: \\"What the outside world refers to as 'the weekend' is a round trip to the ninth circle of hell for parents.... You are woken on a Saturday morning at six or seven o'clock by people getting into your bed. They cry or shout loudly in your ear. They kick you in the stomach, in the face.\\"<br /><br />Cusk is at her best when describing parenthood in scenes such as the above. Less successful are the more philosophical passages of the book (the female is \\"a world steeped in its own mild, voluntary oppression, a world at whose fringes one may find intersections to the real: to particular kinds of unhappiness, or discrimination, or fear, or to a whole realm of existence both past and present that grows more individuated and indeterminate and inarticulatable as time goes by\\") and the strange inclusion and discussion of parenthood-related literary passages culled, for example, from Jane Eyre and Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth.<br /><br />A lot of people could benefit from reading Cusk's account. New mothers will find solace, perhaps, in its pages, validation of their own feelings of isolation and resentment. Working fathers ought to read it, so they can better understand the complaints of their shut-in wives, for whom \\"work is considered an easy, attractive option.\\" And the childless friends of parents will find the book a highly readable explanation of what is happening in their friends' lives.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceupied house, \\"which no amount of work appears to eradicate.\\"  And she details for the non-parent, wont to lie in of a Saturday morning, what weekends are like for parents: \\"What the outside world refers to as 'the weekend' is a round trip to the ninth circle of hell for parents....

Lawrence	Books	3	9	14	N	Y	A good, but not a great read	The title of Geoff Dyer's Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence is taken from something Lawrence wrote of his own author-inspired work: \\"Out of sheer rage I've begun my book on Thomas Hardy. It will be about anything but Thomas Hardy I am afraid--queer stuff--but not bad.\\" Just so, Dyer's book is not really about D.H. Lawrence--it is like one of \\"those wild books\\" Dyer describes \\"in which there is no attempt to cover the ground thoroughly or reasonably\\"--though Lawrence's life and writing do provide the book with what framework it has.<br /><br />In conversational prose that makes his meandering narrative a fast read, Dyer recounts his experiences while trying to write a serious book about Lawrence. We follow the author as he travels around the world visiting the places Lawrence lived--Sicily, England, New Mexico--and while he pores over Lawrence's preserved correspondence. In the process we learn a little about Lawrence--he paid his bills on time, he is unlikely to have been comfortable naked, he tended to be angry much of the time, he was handy around the house. Mostly we learn about Lawrence's characteristics because they are shared by Dyer, about whom we learn a great deal. (Dyer, too, pays his bills on time, though he is not handy around the house.)<br /><br />Dyer's defining characteristic is what he describes as his \\"rheumatism of the will, this chronic inability to see anything through.\\"  It is the reason he cannot decide finally where in the world he wants to live (a trait he shares with Lawrence), why he therefore lives \\"perpetually on the brink of potential departure,\\"  not acquiring the \\"trappings of permanence\\"--because while he may detest his current living arrangements, he suspects that he would regret at once the decision to give up the sublet he now finds stultifying.<br /><br />Dyer's paralyzing indecision likewise renders him unable to do the exercises that will repair his knee and save him from continual pain, unable to decide whether or not to pack a particular book in his luggage, unable to write the serious study of Lawrence he originally had in mind, unable to write the book he was postponing writing by beginning the book on Lawrence. It is a wonder, in the end, that Dyer manages to conduct his life at all.<br /><br />Dyer is also, like Lawrence, an angry man. While Lawrence was allegedly \\"angry even in his sleep,\\"  Dyer describes himself, sometimes amusingly, as cursing and muttering under his breath throughout the day, raging over insignificant annoyances.<br /><br />\\"A few days ago the local delicatessen had run out of the luxury doughnuts which I have for my elevenses and on which I depend utterly.... Right, I thought to myself, turning on my heel and walking out, grim-faced and tight-lipped, I will return later in the day and burn the place to the ground with all the staff in it--friendly, charming staff, incidentally, who have often let me owe them money--so that they could experience a fraction of the pain that I had suffered by not being able to have my morning doughnut.\\"<br /><br />Dyer complains in the book about a lot of things--Italians, children, parents of children, literary criticism. I thought him a bit obnoxious early on in my reading, when he faulted the Greek fellow he'd rented a moped from for refusing to return his deposit on the bike after he (Dyer) had totaled it (through his own fault). His attitude becomes somewhat more forgivable when you come to understand that he recognizes, at least sometimes, how inappropriate his anger is.<br /><br />There were times that Dyer's writing annoyed me. Particularly in the beginning of the book, he tended to repeat himself. He may have done so in a conscious attempt to add to the informal feel of his prose, but if so I think he went too far. For example:<br /><br />\\"The next morning I could not move. I had to be helped out of bed. I couldn't move.\\"<br /><br />On a number of occasions, too, I was left wondering whether he was getting sloppy with his writing or was achieving some poetic depth I couldn't appreciate:<br /><br />\\"The puddles by the roadside offered no reflection: the water was too old for that, was no longer sensitive to light.\\"<br /><br />But there were also a number of things in Dyer's book that I quite liked. There was the occasional simple, lovely sentence: \\"Not a great choice [of restaurants] from my point of view since sea-food is vile filth which I will eat under no circumstances.\\"  The relationship between Dyer's acquaintances Ciccio and Renata, who phone one another compulsively throughout the day, was priceless. And perhaps my favorite part of the book--the only part I found downright funny--was Dyer's description of his mortifying experience giving a lecture about Lawrence in Denmark. Thoroughly unprepared for the talk and sick with a bad cold, Dyer tried to use his illness and an ill-timed nose bleed to, at the least, gain a measure of sympathy from the audience. Which he failed to do.<br /><br />As a window into the personality of a writer--Dyer, of course, not Lawrence--Out of Sheer Rage makes good, if not great, reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceloppy with his writing or was achieving some poetic depth I couldn't appreciate:<br /><br />\\"The puddles by the roadside offered no reflection: the water was too old for that, was no longer sensitive to light.\\"<br /><br />But there were also a number of things in Dyer's book that I quite liked.

His death was a particularly horrific one as the poison that was used, a massive dose of tartar emetic (a derivative of antimony), is a highly corrosive substance. In the three days it took Bravo to die, the poison \\"burned through the tissue lining his alimentary canal\\" and ate away at his large intestine until it had all but disintegrated. The police eventually determined that Bravo's death was not a straightforward case of suicide, but who among Bravo's household or acquaintances had the means and motive to kill him? There were numerous suspects: the coachman George Griffiths, whom Bravo had recently dismissed and who had publicly prophesied his former employer's death; Bravo's wife Florence, who had suffered two miscarriages already in their five-month marriage and whom Bravo was eager to impregnate again; Florence's former lover James Gully, the respected doctor who numbered among his patients Charles Darwin and Florence Nightingale; Florence's female companion and mother figure, Jane Cox, whom Bravo had also threatened with dismissal. Despite the abundance of likely suspects, however, the Bravo murder investigation, one of the Victorian era's most infamous cases, was never solved.<br /><br />Over the more than 120 years since Bravo's murder, the case has attracted considerable attention, with armchair detectives, among them Agatha Christie, attempting to puzzle out a solution to the unsolved crime. James Ruddick follows in this tradition, although he differs from his predecessors in using as evidence not only the records of the Coroner's inquest from which they derived information, but also original police records and the testimony of surviving relatives of the principals. Ruddick claims to have uncovered in his research evidence which has enabled him finally to expose the murderer. The evidence Ruddick offers is perhaps not as definitive as he suggests--while it does appear to exculpate one of the suspects, it does not prove the guilt of the person he fingers for the crime--but the author's reconstruction of the murder is indeed a persuasive one.<br /><br />Death at the Priory is an example of popular history at its finest. It is fast-paced and suspenseful. The prose is highly readable. (My favorite sentence: \\"An unhappy woman with easy access to weedkiller had to be watched carefully.\\") And the story Ruddick tells--of the murder and its investigation, and of Florence's abusive first marriage and scandalous affair with James Gully--is inherently fascinating. There were occasions, however, when I wanted more information. What, for example, *was* that notorious Victorian malady \\"brain fever\\" that Florence was thought to be suffering from at one point? And what was so \\"famous\\" (as Ruddick refers to it) about the Bridge of Sighs that separated the men's quarters from the women's at Dr. Gully's clinic? (And is this bridge indeed famous, or has Ruddick transferred the epithet from the better known Bridge of Sighs in Venice?) I also had some questions, not necessarily damning, about Ruddick's reconstruction of the crime. (Why, for example, given his reconstruction, did Jane Cox go to such lengths to try to revive Charles Bravo after his collapse?) These might have been resolved at once had Ruddick been across the room from me while I was reading, but, strangely, he was not.<br /><br />These minor issues aside, Ruddick's contribution to the literature on the Bravo cases makes excellent, nearly un-put-downable reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecee suggests--while it does appear to exculpate one of the suspects, it does not prove the guilt of the person he fingers for the crime--but the author's reconstruction of the murder is indeed a persuasive one.<br /><br />Death at the Priory is an example of popular history at its finest.

The logistics of the body's disposal, the fear that it will be discovered once buried, the protagonist's dread of being found out, and the mystery of how Peter Morton came to be in this situation in the first place, wrongfully dead, form the tense backbone of Rhian Ellis's debut novel. But After Life is not so much a suspense novel--though it is suspenseful--as it is the slow unfolding of the life of the protagonist, Naomi Ash.<br /><br />Naomi, a medium at the time of Peter's death, grew up as the daughter of a medium in New Orleans. There, ensconced in a dumbwaiter in her grandfather's house, Naomi would rap on the walls of her mother's s&eacute;ance room, doing her bit for the family business, or she would pretend to be the disembodied voice of some client's dead child. Later, mother and daughter moved north to a spiritualist colony in New York state, a town whose eccentric residents are, for the most part, psychics of one sort or another.<br /><br />After Life is, in large part, a book about Naomi's relationship with her mother, both of them flawed, believable characters who are bound to one another by ineffably strong ties. It is also about how events, large and small--unkindnesses, deaths, thoughtlessness--can shatter one's happiness, and how survivors go on living nevertheless.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-09-22

Granted, the position has its perquisites--immortality and the potential for world domination and so on--but on the other hand there is the difficult issue of the anthropophagous beast's appetite. Travis, unwilling demonkeeper and good guy that he is, has tried to limit Catch's diet over the years to drug dealers and other of life's non-innocents. But the situation is less than ideal, and Travis is eager to sever his relationship with Catch.<br /><br />The solution to Travis's dilemma may lie in Pine Cove, California, a tourist town populated by intriguing characters like Howard Phillips, owner of H.P.'s Cafe, who believes that his daily specials may be the only thing keeping the world from subjugation to a pre-human race. (Howard insists that his waitresses describe the specials in memorized passages of overwrought prose. Ham and eggs is \\"a fiendishly toothsome amalgamation of scrumptious ingredients so delicious that the mere description of the palatable gestalt could drive one mad.\\") Also arrived in Pine Cove is Gian Hen Gian, a rumpled little demon hunter who curses in blue swirls and hankers after table salt, and who once worked construction on King Solomon's temple.<br /><br />Christopher Moore is a witty and imaginative writer, and Practical Demonkeeping, Moore's first book, is a fun read.

Nothing you can put your finger on, just.... Maybe your husband's stopped yelling at the kids? Don't assume it's nothing. More than likely, his body's been replicated cell by cell, down to *almost* the last detail, as part of an attempt by extra-terrestrial pod creatures to take over the earth.<br /><br />Or maybe not. The point is, you've seen the movie, maybe even the *movies*--the original 1956 film (with Kevin McCarthy) was remade in both 1978 (with Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy) and (less successfully) 1993. Now it's time to read the book.<br /><br />Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel, first published in 1954, is a fast-paced thriller that will keep you up reading late into the night. The prose is light; the plot is unbeatable. And you never know: just because you've seen the movies doesn't mean you know how the book's gonna end.<br /><br />P.S.

The story, half remembered and half reconstructed, is narrated by an old man who was in his youth an acquaintance of the murderer's son.<br /><br />The story, told in plain, unremarkable prose, hosts more than its share of unhappiness--dead mothers and adultery and neglected children torn from one or another parent. There is also canine unhappiness, the imagined wretchedness of an imagined dog, whose loyalty and service is repaid with beatings and abandonment.<br /><br />So Long, See You Tomorrow has the feel of a high school English class must-read. That is to say, it is undoubtedly good literature, but it is not good reading.	2003-09-18

Happily, I now have a data point to support my theory. Erik Tarloff's The Man who Wrote the Book starts well: \\"A deep, dispiriting despondency, an oppressive enervating angst, settled over Ezra Gordon around the time Dr. Jacobs put her hand up his bum.\\" The mood having thus been set, the rest of the book does not disappoint.<br /><br />At thirty-five, Ezra Gordon's better days are behind him--or so his doctor informs him after having withdrawn from his rump. Ezra, at least, is in no position to argue with her. Divorced and deprived of access to his daughter, he is involved in a seemingly pointless relationship with Carol, the sanctimonious spawn of the blustering Reverend Mr. Dimsdale, chaplain at Buehler College. Ezra himself teaches at Buehler, a Baptist cow college in California, but with too few articles under his belt and no stomach for further deconstruction, his upcoming tenure decision does not look promising.<br /><br />Broke and miserable, under suspicion of sexual harassment, with his life falling apart, Ezra escapes during spring break to the hedonistic realm of his old friend Isaac Schwimmer, one-time graduate student turned successful publisher of pornography. There he consents to write The Book, a fast bit of anonymous, lucrative porn, which turns out to be likeable by the likes of John Updike, and which consequently turns Ezra's life upside down.<br /><br />The Man who Wrote the Book is a good read, fast and funny, with amusing, well-written dialogue. Ezra's internal dialogue, the caustic or ironic comments he leaves unsaid, is even funnier.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-09-16

When he encounters some thousands of snails slime-trailing their way around the wet terraces of his vacation bungalow, Pepin doesn't just register their appearance as a curiosity and move on, as we might. He thinks \\"Dinner!\\" and runs around excitedly collecting the creatures in a wastepaper basket. When a friend complains that his boat's outboard motor regularly hits something hard in a particular shallow channel, Pepin investigates and once again finds a free lunch--the obstruction is a shoal of mussels from which he happily gathers a feast.<br /><br />These stories hint at the most striking revelation of Pepin's autobiography, The Apprentice: My Life in the Kitchen: the man is obsessed with food. This ought not come as a surprise, I suppose. Pepin is, after all, a renowned professional chef. But not every professional is so taken with the subject of his expertise. Love of food and its preparation--foraging or fishing for it, prying it from the walls of a vacation resort, simmering it on his own stovetop or stirring up consommes in thousand-gallon vats--pervades Pepin's life.<br /><br />In straightforward, readable prose, The Apprentice tells the story of Pepin's life in food, from his childhood in war-rationed France--where his father, a member of the Resistance, smuggled the occasional banana to his wife and sons; to his apprenticeship in the kitchens of his mother's restaurants and under a series of respected French chefs; to his increasingly successful career in America. Throughout, one marvels at the author's apparently flawless memory for cooking. Remarkably, Pepin describes in detail dishes he made decades earlier, their ingredients and preparation, how the meal was received. These sections of the book do not make for the most scintillating reading for those of us who are not food aficionados, but they are impressive even so. For those who *are* inclined to take to the stove, Pepin includes more than twenty recipes in the book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecethe book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-09-13

He encounters there the eccentric, 72-year-old Jasper Hudnut, formerly an academic physicist, who is intrigued by a jet-ski-looking machine he finds stashed in the museum's basement. Though Prince is a trifle unnerved by the occasional, near maniacal intensity of Hudnut's gaze, he accompanies his new acquaintance to a nearby caf&eacute;, where the conversation turns quickly to politics--specifically to Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s. Hudnut would prefer a world in which Reagan had never been elected. But unlike your average embittered liberal, content to complain about Reagan's ascendancy, Hudnut means to prevent it.<br /><br />So begins Delacorte's delightful time travel novel, which is at least as likeable as Jack Finney's classic Time and Again--even for readers who do not share Hudnut's political views. Told in the first person, the book is Prince's account of his journey, at Hudnut's urging, to 1938 Hollywood, where the likes of Humphrey Bogart and Errol Flynn, not to mention B movie star \\"Dutch\\" Reagan, can regularly be spotted in the Warner Brothers commissary. But changing history is not as<br />easy as it looks. Sometimes you don't get it right on the first try. Delacorte's plot becomes deliciously complicated as Prince attempts repeatedly to manipulate events to his satisfaction. The ending of  Time on My Hands will leave you pondering the book's twists, and hoping that Delacorte means it when he says he'd like to write a sequel.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-09-09

At once an alarm sounds, triggered by the painting's removal, and an iron gate falls shut, sealing the Gallery off from the rest of the museum and separating Sauniere from his attacker.<br />In the brief interval between his deliberate self-imprisonment and his death, Sauniere constructs an elaborate cipher and, ingeniously, handpicks the individuals who will undertake its solution. French cryptologist Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor and symbologist, must unravel the riddle of the curator's dying message. The path Sauniere sets the two on leads to a series of equally ingenious puzzles and involves them in a historical conspiracy. Wanted by the police, Neveu and Langdon are also shadowed by Sauniere's killer and by the elusive figure who directs him.<br />As the above summary may suggest, the plot of The DaVinci Code is a complex one, and Brown must impart a great deal of detailed, near scholarly information to readers to make his story comprehensible. But to the author's great credit, the requisite information--about Leonardo DaVinci, or the Knights Templar, or the devout Catholic sect Opus Dei--is delivered at precisely the right moments in the story, and in the right doses, so that the reader is never overwhelmed by it. The plotting of the book, too, is masterful: Brown doles out his revelations so the reader is left wanting more after every bite-sized chapter. The book's characters, particularly the renaissance man Sauniere, are intriguing and likeable. In short, The DaVinci Code is a perfect, riveting novel that will grab you in its first paragraph and keep you reading late into the night.	2003-09-04

At 35,000 feet in the air, bound for the crowning achievement of Joe's career, Joan decides that it has to stop. She will leave her husband when they get back home, after suffering through the coming bout of accolades.<br /><br />Starting with the revelation of Joan's decision, The Wife tells the story of the Castleman marriage, from ignominious beginning to polite cohabitation, in a series of reminiscences that, while jumping about chronologically, are never disjointed.

Conversation flagged.&#34;<br /><br />After the cutlet has been downed, Sir Oliver invites these same neighbors to his upcoming birthday celebration, a family gathering regarded with dread by all concerned, not as an act of kindness but so they may serve as &#34;diversionary targets.&#34;<br /><br />Given a lifetime, more or less, of his theatrical antisocial behavior, it is hardly surprising that Farleigh-Stubbs's death--he is murdered at the aforementioned birthday party--upsets virtually no one. (The reading of his will is a more emotional affair for the principals.) But which of the author's myriad victims was incensed enough by his abuse to kill him? Well written, and with an appealing cast of characters, Death of a Mystery Writer is another fine whodunit from Robert Barnard.<br /><br />(Interestingly, the last sentence of the book--or perhaps just the last, four-word phrase--seems as if it was tacked on as an afterthought, perhaps in response to someone's suggestion that the author's intent was not otherwise clear. But it was clear, and the ending would have been slightly stronger without the superfluous text.)	2003-08-26

An effete eccentric with a genius for mechanical invention, Santos designed and regularly flew about Paris a series of airships. Most of these were powered, lighter-than-air vessels--hydrogen balloons to which he had attached a motor. But later in his career Santos also experimented with heavier-than-air flying machines--though not, to his great disappointment, before the Wright brothers had themselves achieved sustained flight. Among the aviator's airships was the world's first, and only, personal flying machine. Santos hopped around Paris in his \\"Baladeuse,\\" or \\"Wanderer,\\" alighting to order an aperitif at some sidewalk caf&eacute;, or dropping anchor at a club where, upon disembarking, he would hand the reins of his machine to a valet.<br /><br />Paul Hoffman's seamless account of Santos-Dumont's life and career follows the aviator from his childhood on his father's coffee plantation to his sad death in 1932. Always somewhat tormented--Santos craved the adoration his pioneering exploits won for him--he ended his days apparently guilt-ridden over the lethal use to which airplanes--which were to his mind his own invention--were being put.<br /><br />Hoffman's well-written book is fascinating for its invocation of a lost world. The author is to be applauded, too, for bringing the flamboyant, troubled Santos-Dumont once again to the attention of the public.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-08-23

The stories are similar to Finney's classic novel Time and Again--in which the book's protagonist travels back to late 19th-century New York--both because nearly all of them have to do with time travel (\\"Lunch-Hour Magic\\" and \\"Home Alone\\" are exceptions) and because many of the characters express their dissatisfaction with the modern world and wish to escape from it. Usually this flight from modernity is to be achieved by time travel, but it can also take the form of interplanetary migration (\\"Of Missing Persons\\") or balloon flight (\\"Home Alone\\").<br /><br />Time travel in these stories is achieved almost effortlessly, when the \\"thousand invisible chains\\" that keep us in the present--modern coins and manufactured items, apartment buildings--are, for a moment, loosed. If there's nothing on you that wouldn't belong in the world fifty or sixty or seventy years ago, and if you're in a place that hasn't been altered much in all that time, and if you're in the right frame of mind, you can slip into the past, easy as can be. Just so, the car-obsessed college student of Finney's \\"Second Chance,\\" while driving along an old highway in his restored Jordan Playboy, finds himself sharing the road with Model T's. His brief presence in the past has the effect of altering history in a way that will influence his own future.<br /><br />Al and his wife Nell of Finney's \\"Such Intersting Neighbors\\" find the Hellenbeks, who have just moved into their California neighborhood, strange but pleasant. Ted Hellenbek is an inventor, an intelligent guy who was born and raised in the U.S., and yet he fumbles with his money, unable to count it out himself, when he has to pay the driver of his cab upon his arrival in town. Alfred Pullen buys a paper with a 1958 Wilson dime in \\"The Coin Collector\\" and finds himself at once in an alternative universe where such coins exist--and where he has married a different woman. In \\"Where the Cluetts Are\\" an architect helps a couple build a house following blueprints that belonged to his grandfather. The house, with its peaked roof and many gables, is an anachronism, and it has a curious effect on its inhabitants. In \\"Lunch-Hour Magic\\" an advertising agency employee buys a pair of glasses that allow him to see through women's clothes:<br /><br />\\"I kept the glasses on nearly all afternoon, wandering around the office with a sheaf of papers in my hand, and strangely it was Mrs. Humphrey, our middle-aged overweight bookkeeper, that I stared at longest. Last year, I knew, she'd celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of her marriage to her husband, Harvey. But there, unmistakably, tattooed on her left hip, was a four-inch high red heart inside which, in a slanted blue script, was inscribed Ralph, and I wondered if she'd had the fearsome job of hiding it from Harvey for a quarter of a century.\\"<br /><br />Finney writes well--that \\"fearsome job\\" is quite good--and his stories are clever. If they are not quite as well done as his novels, this collection nevertheless makes a pleasant and easy read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecet--and where he has married a different woman.

This time around, two people are dead and a dog's gone missing, and someone is harassing Belle with threatening, home-made crosswords. As usual, readers get to solve the puzzles along with Belle (there are six of them), though most of us will not have the facility with words that our heroine enjoys. She can dash off a handful of eight-letter words for \\"criminal\\" without pausing to think.<br /><br />The Nero Blanc books are good little mysteries and fast reads. What makes them particularly appealing, however, for those of us who like puzzles, is the incorporation of crosswords into the stories and the occasional focus on Belle Graham's admirable verbal gymnastics.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-08-20

At twenty degrees below zero, Nestor didn't manage to live until morning, when a H&auml;agen Dazs-seeking employee finally opened the door, but he did have time to come to an imperfect understanding of the circumstances of his death. The fortune teller he had seen two weeks before had given him enough information to figure out some of it.<br /><br />In Little Indiscretions Carmen Posadas pieces together the coincidences and peccadilloes that surrounded Nestor's demise--not his own failings, as he was a discreet confidant, and a loyal friend, and he ran a clean kitchen, but those of his acquaintances: from his friend Carlos's love affair with a picturesque woman to the skeletons in the<br />Teldis' separate bedroom closets to the unwelcome longings of widower Serafin Tous.<br /><br />Posadas's story is a good one, and the reader is eager, nearing the end, to discover which--if any--of the indiscretions uncovered in its course has culminated in Nestor's death by freezing. But I found the solution to Nestor's puzzle, the reason, finally, that the freezer door closed behind him, hard to believe. The story was also more difficult to follow than it might have been because the author tells it in disconnected chunks, going backward in time from Nestor's death, then forward, and incorporating memories of much older, yet still haunting, events.	2003-08-20

In it the author dwells on the shaky foundations of the Mormon Church, whose founder, Joseph Smith, is revealed as a sex-crazed charlatan. He also writes about the near criminal practices of auction houses, particularly Sotheby's, which seems to have deliberately ignored evidence that the \\"new\\" poem by Emily Dickinson it was auctioning was in fact a forgery. But the rest of us, who are neither Mormons nor Sotheby's employees, can only delight in Worrall's fascinating book.<br /><br />The Poet and the Murderer tells the true-life story of Mark Hofmann, a disaffected Mormon with a genius for deception. Hofmann's forgeries--of Emily Dickinson, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Joseph Smith, Daniel Boone, and over a hundred other historical figures--were expertly produced, a feat that requires far more than the superficial replication of a subject's pen strokes. Hofmann used paper ripped from period books, manufactured his own ink, and wrote under self-hypnosis so that his forgeries would not be betrayed by evidence of hesitancy. Many of Hofmann's forgeries were intended to undermine the religion he had grown up to despise, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, by inserting into the historical record documents that were embarrassing to the Church. One could almost admire this man, who was so scrupulous in his work and so evidently intelligent--except that his crimes did not stop at forging.<br /><br />Worrall also devotes much of his book to a discussion of Emily Dickinson, the \\"poet\\" of the title, as one of Hofmann's more daring forgeries was a poem that he composed and passed off as one of her lost works. Her reclusiveness, sexuality, handwriting, potential incontinence, and bizarre family life are all discussed, as is the sale of the Dickinson poem by Sotheby's years after Hofmann's imprisonment for murder. But while Dickinson shares equal billing with Mark Hofmann in the title of Worrall's book, The Poet and the Murderer has more to do with the Mormon Church than it does with Amherst's famous recluse. Not that there's anything wrong with that.<br /><br />Nor is there very much wrong with this book. On a few occasions the author repeats himself. His narration in the Epilogue of a dream he'd had about Dickinson is perhaps a bit much. More importantly, when it comes, Hofmann's transformation from a brilliant and seemingly unassailable forger into a cash-strapped inventor of fraudulent investment schemes seems too abrupt. Why would Hofmann, who was otherwise so controlled, have adopted behavior almost certain to get him caught? Why, for example, did he accept nearly $200,000 as payment for documents he never intended to forge? Perhaps the answers to these questions were not forthcoming, and perhaps Hofmann's downfall was indeed thus abrupt.<br /><br />One thing Worrall does succeed at particularly is transforming Hofmann in the reader's mind from a relatively harmless, almost admirable white-collar criminal into a reprehensible, sociopathic villain. Worrall's account of Hofmann's murders--to get creditors off his back he blew up two people with pipe bombs--and his description of the physical remains of Hofmann's two wholly innocent victims are chilling. And Worrall's book as a whole is gripping.

How, that is, does the average bigamist--not your Mormon extremist type whose wives all know the hubby's sleeping around, but the regular-seeming guy with a wife and kids in Schenectady and another family in Detroit--how does that guy keep it all straight, all the personal stuff you have to remember when you're part of a familial unit? Birthdays and anniversaries in the nuclear and extended families, which set of kids is playing which sports, spousal preferences of various sorts and what you've told to whom. It's hard enough for a faithful monogamist not to get the facts wrong.<br /><br />Kathryn Cheet, the protagonist of Anna Davis's Cheet, is not a bigamist, because she's not married. But she is managing--just--to keep six relationships going simultaneously. One secret of Kathryn's success is her clever use of multiple, color-coded cell phones--pink for Amy (Kathryn's one female lover), red for Jonny (her scarred musician), green for Richard (her serious guy, with daughter), and so on. Just as important for her success, Kathryn works driving a cab around London at night. Since she is always mobile and she doesn't have a radio in her car, Kathryn's lovers can only reach her by cell phone, and they never know where she will be at any particular time. Kathryn has even managed to keep the whereabouts of her apartment a secret from them--or, at least, from all but one of them. Not surprisingly, Kathryn's carefully compartmentalized world begins to fall apart in the course of Davis's novel. Evidently, you can only keep so many lovers in a single city before the worlds you've constructed with each of them begin to overlap.<br /><br />Anna Davis's book, at first merely light fare, builds in suspense and gravity as the pages pass, with the reader wondering whether Kathryn, an otherwise likable character, will ever stop torturing herself and those around her with her unlikely juggling act.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-08-12

The book opens with the first of many colorful scenes, a roomful of plastic surgeons practicing their grotesque (at the best of times) trade on a bunch of severed heads. \\"The heads have been put in roasting pans--which are of the disposable aluminum variety--for the same reason chickens are put in roasting pans: to catch the drippings.\\" As this passage illustrates, the author keeps the tone of her book light. She is a clever writer, and she makes the sorts of observations of her grim material that the Mystery Science Theater bots might make.<br /><br />But however light her touch, Roach is describing some truly horrific things. There is, for example, the body farm at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where bodies go to rot for science, their skin sloughing off and their genitalia bloating in full view of researchers and their guests--who leave with their footwear uncleanably soiled with the \\"liquids of human decay.\\" There is the graduate student who composted a ne'er-do-well to see how efficacious a means of disposal mulch-making might be for third-world countries. (\\"And because the man was buried whole, Evans had to go out with a shovel and rake to aerate him three or four times.\\") And there is Roach's attempt--failed--to verify the details of a 1991 Reuter's article which claimed that \\"a man who worked in a crematorium in Hainan Province was caught hacking the buttocks and thighs off cadavers prior to incineration and bringing the meat to his brother, who ran the nearby White Temple Restaurant.\\" Roach hired an interpreter to facilitate her discussion with the director of the crematorium she believed had employed the buttock-hacker. But how to explain to the interpreter what she needed to know? \\"In the cab, I tried to think of a way to explain to Sandy what I was about to have her do. I need you to ask this man whether he had an employee who cut the butt cheeks off cadavers to serve in his brother's restaurant. No matter how I thought of phrasing it, it sounded ghastly and absurd.

And you'll need a minion to take care of certain errands for you, like going to the bank or hunting for a new apartment with a windowless bedroom. Meanwhile, your inhumanly acute senses are picking up the sound of gnats whirring around down the block, and you don't even know *how* to be undead.

She wakes up under a dumpster with her left hand burnt to a crisp and perhaps a  hundred thousand dollars tucked inside her blouse. (\\"A man attacked me, choked me, bit my neck, burned my hand, then stuffed my shirt full of money and put a dumpster on me and now I can see heat and hear fog.

She finds a minion right off the bat, a nineteen-year-old would-be writer who's just moved to San Francisco from Indiana. Tommy will do just about anything for Jody, short of eating bugs, and that includes tolerating--indeed bonding with--a dead guy in their freezer. Soon Jody's hanging from the ceiling of their shared bedroom, reading Kerouac aloud in a post-coital, vampiric display. She and Tommy have lucked into an improbable love connection, but their relationship is not without its problems: Jody's mother doesn't approve of Tommy, for one thing, and blood-drained corpses keep turning up in the neighborhood....<br /><br />Bloodsucking Fiends abounds in clever dialogue and dark humor.

Hay is a picturesque town, with cobblestone streets and thatch-roofed houses and its own castle, a half-ruined edifice occupied by Hay's self-proclaimed king, who happens to be, as are so many of Hay's inhabitants, a bookseller. Collins and his family rent an apartment in town (his mailing address becomes, simply, The Apartment: it's that small a village) and live out of their suitcases and stroller while house hunting and book buying. The author also works part-time for the king in his bookstore, a place crammed with more musty volumes than the royal's workers can ever organize.<br /><br />Collins' attempt to buy an old house in Hay--he toys with purchasing the eponymous Sixpence House, a lopsided former pub that threatens to be a money pit--merely provides the skeleton for the author's delightful, meandering narrative. It is at times hilarious, as when, for example, Collins describes his first book-reading, or rather, his pre-reading sojourn in the bathroom:<br /><br />\\"There's nowhere dry for me to put my papers down, so I have to tuck my papers under my chin while I pee, which works till--chiff--into the toilet, and I grab, and recoil, then grab again--and I have saved my manuscript, the thing I am still hoping to read from this evening, except for the first page, which is not just soaked, it is soaked with urine. I stand alone in the bathroom, horrified. I do not have another copy with me. But, what they do have here is--a hand dryer. And so there I stand, drying off my masterpiece over the ineffectual vent. It takes a long time. Someone finally walks in on my performance art, and there I am, drying my pee-soaked words--Hello, top of the evening to you. Finally I give up and throw the whole thing out.\\"<br /><br />In addition to urine-soaked manuscripts, there are recycled gravestones to read about, and near poisonous glasses of cider, and lyrical vomiting, and scheming Lords, and, everywhere, a bibliophile's revelry in old books. Collins, moreover, can write. Each page offers some beautifully or wittily phrased nugget for the reader to savor. (On the idea \\"that a character can develop a will of his own and 'take over a book,'\\" Collins writes: \\"A character can no more take over your novel than an eggplant and a jar of cumin can take over your kitchen.\\") One can lament only that the book is not twice as long.<br /><br />(Actually, one can lament something else, but *read no further* if you have not either read or written the book: I was convinced that the author would end up buying Sixpence House and living out an idyllic, writerly life among the eccentrics of Hay. Indeed, though all indications suggested otherwise, I was sure the last chapter would end with either Paul or his wife coming to his or her senses and announcing that, money be damned, they wanted that house! But, it didn't happen.

This romantic personal history makes Aczel particularly suited to tell the story of the compass, which so improved navigation in the late thirteenth century that it sparked a commercial revolution and made possible the Age of Exploration that was to follow.<br /><br />In his highly readable narrative Aczel provides a brief history of navigation centered on the compass--from navigation by stars and sounding lines to the naval supremacy of the Venetians in the 14th and 15th centuries to the masterful sailing of the great explorers--da Gama, Magellan--who opened up the world in the 15th and 16th centuries. We learn, too, about the early invention of the compass in China, where it was evidently not used at sea, and of its perfection as a naval instrument in the Italian city of Amalfi.<br /><br />The Riddle of the Compass is at its best when Aczel discusses the actual \\"riddle\\" to which the title of the book refers: the question of the historicity of a certain Flavio Gioia, whom the people of Amalfi credit with having invented the mariner's compass in 1302. Most interestingly, the question of this Gioia's existence involves the correct interpretation of a single Latin phrase, a reference to the invention of the compass in an early 16th century commentary on the poetry of Lucrezio Caro.<br /><br />Readers of Dava Sobel's popular book Longitude, which tells the story of the invention of the naval chronometer, will enjoy Amir Aczel's equally readable history of the compass.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2003-07-15

This time he is Frederick Jackson Carnaby, the actor's twin brother, a wild animal dealer visiting Washington from Kenya. There's nothing unusual about Rex's flight or his performance as Frederick, but the next morning Rex finds a picture of himself in the obituaries. The fictional Frederick Jackson Carnaby, it seems, has met his death en route from Washington to London.<br /><br />The report of Frederick's death is the first in a series of events orchestrated by a certain \\"Follensbee\\"--we find out the mastermind's true identity only near the book's end--who is trying to drive Rex mad. In the weeks following the appearance of the obituary, Rex is haunted by voices in his house, by the creeping suspicion, cleverly planted by his tormentor, that he killed his own father as a child, and by the unwelcome attentions of a new member of his therapy group. Follensbee's reasons for persecuting Rex are not clear until his plot is finally revealed, but we do know that he intends for Rex, in his madness, to murder his own young son--the only full-blooded relative he has. As Rex's sanity unravels--rather too quickly--according to plan, it seems inevitable that he will act out the scenario Follensbee has conceived.<br /><br />The plan of attack Follensbee has devised is indeed ingenious, though it depends on the assumption that a man driven to a state of \\"primal madness\\" must necessarily commit the primal crime, the murder of a family member. This assumption of the inevitability of Rex's murder once he is driven mad, however, is difficult to accept, and so one cannot be quite swept away by the book's plot. The Man who Wasn't There is nevertheless a decent, quick read that will keep you guessing, if not wide-eyed and glued to your seat.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient GreeceLife in Ancient Greece	2003-07-15
US	52923654	R2YCSVMAN1TIC4	0156005565	849027698	Catapult: Harry and I Build a Siege Weapon	Books	2	4	11	N	N	An unappealing principal character, and a lot of filler	Jim Paul found a cool rock, a piece of Red Creek quartzite some two and a half billion years old, and the heft of the thing suggested a project to him: building a catapult. So he talked his friend Harry into helping him build one, and he talked the director of the Headlands Center for the Arts into giving him $500 toward the expense of its construction. Building the catapult and firing it, he evidently claimed in his proposal to the director, \\"would be a way of reliving the thought and action of the army men who had lived out there in the Headlands [where Paul proposed to fire the weapon].\\" Harry and he would be \\"recapitulating the development of weapons technology, putting on the mask of the weapon-maker. It would be a Conceptual Reconstruction.\\" For some reason, the Center bought this claim of catapult building as art and handed the author a check. But taking this money imposed certain obligations on Paul, who now had a deadline to work under and a public talk to give after he'd fired the thing. Paul's book tells the story of the catapult's construction and firing, and of the presentation with which his relationship with the catapult was concluded. After the talk the machine was disassembled and put on a scrap heap.<br /><br />Paul may have come up with the idea of building the catapult, but that seems to have been the extent of his intellectual contribution to the machine's construction. His friend Harry, a man with considerable mechanical sense, figured out how to build the weapon. Paul got the money, and he went out to pick up Chinese food when necessary, and he apparently read up on catapult history. As part of his research he even looked up the word \\"spring\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. The next morning, armed with his new-found etymological expertise, Paul went off, sans Harry, and bought springs for the catapult--wholly inadequate springs for which he was overcharged, and which he purchased without any apparent consideration of the weapon's requirements.<br /><br />The author's foolishness in this instance is one among a number of reasons that he--or the persona he adopts for the book--is an unappealing figure. There is also Paul's disingenuous bid for grant money, his attempt to make Harry contribute to the project financially, his flippant attitude toward his promises and obligations to the Center, the fact that he made a habit of throwing tantrums on golf courses when he was fourteen, and--potentially worst of all--his careless firing of the catapult without first surveying the target area. As he and Harry later discovered, their ammunition fell not in the San Francisco Bay, but on the beach, very near where sunbathers regularly lie out in the nude.<br /><br />The book has other problems in addition to its principal character's questionable likeability. It contains illustrations, but they are wholly inadequate. Without decent drawings or photographs of the catapult at every stage of its construction, it is difficult to follow the author's discussions of the machine's various parts. More importantly, much of the book comes across as filler. The bare bones story of the catapult's construction could not sustain a book-length narrative--even with the page and a half spent on the protagonists' purchase of gloves:<br /><br />\\"I picked up another pair of the same kind, and we tried them on. They were nice, soft, yellowish split pigskin--the toughest hide you can get, Harry said. They had a short nap like suede, three neat seams down the back of the hand, and reinforced thumbs. We both liked them. We paid for the gloves when we rented the comealong, and pulled the tags off them as soon as they were ours. We stopped in the parking lot to put them on, stretching our fingers inside them and punching our palms to break them in.\\"<br /><br />And even after the two and a half pages about Paul's trip to pick up Chinese food for dinner, something he proposed doing after, as he explains for a paragraph, he found himself with nothing to say to Harry and Harry's wife and brother-in-law. More filler was needed, and so we have numerous chapters inserted into the narrative--chapters about Bessemer and the history of steel-making, about the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the first century A.D. (it involved a catapult!), about Paul golfing with his father in his youth (hence those times when he would \\"stalk back to the clubhouse in tears\\"), about the Los Alamos project and, in yet another irrelevant chapter, about the post-War life of Frank Oppenheimer. In theory, a story that strays off-course at times to encompass interesting anecdotes only tangentially related to the main narrative is, as Martha Stewart might say, a good thing. But this peripheral information ought to arise naturally from the surrounding narrative. Paul's material just sits there, looking very much like something he foisted upon the book to add to its word count.<br /><br />Indeed, one has the uncomfortable sense that Paul put this book together in the same spirit that he put his proposal to the Headlands Center for the Arts together, throwing in willy-nilly whatever he could think of to make the final product acceptable to its judges, and perhaps recognizing all the while that he was a little naughtily trying to get away with something.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecething to say to Harry and Harry's wife and brother-in-law.

US	52923654	R2SAK2C1QS8DNK	0316168688	744408823	The Dogs of Babel	Books	4	1	3	N	Y	A good book that goes a little too far	Paul Iverson came home from work one autumn afternoon to find that his wife Lexy was dead, having fallen from an apple tree in their backyard. Forensic evidence suggested that the fall was accidental, but certain incongruities in Lexy's behavior--she had rearranged the books in one of their bookcases, for example--suggested to her husband that \\"the day of Lexy's death had not been a usual day.\\"<br /><br />The Dogs of Babel tells the bittersweet story of Paul's attempt to recover from and understand Lexy's death. Was it a suicide? There was only one witness to his wife's fall, the couple's Rhodesian Ridgeback, Lorelai, and Iverson, a trained linguist, undertakes to teach the dog to talk. His interactions with Lorelai are sometimes comic, sometimes heart-rending (as when he tells her to \\"Go get Lexy\\"--a command she had never heeded previously--and she runs off, manically sniffing throughout the house for evidence of her dead mistress). The story, narrated by Iverson and written in pleasingly short chapters, jumps gracefully from these training sessions to Paul's attempts to unscramble the riddle of the reordered bookshelf to his memories of his wife--their charming courtship and the unsettling bursts of rage to which Lexy was subject. In the end, Paul's various memories and his detective work coalesce to form a comprehensible narrative of their relationship and of Lexy's last moments.<br /><br />Left at that, Parkhurst's novel would have been highly successful, but the author has also included in her book a section that does not quite fit with the rest. Iverson's interest in canine linguistics leads him to become involved--briefly, and somewhat against his will--with a group of extremists who will stop at nothing in their pursuit of canine speech. This section of the book is horrifying in its details of surgically altered dogs, and one is terrified at the prospect of what may happen to Lorelai. But these shocking chapters are also unrealistic (or so one dearly hopes), and thus out of keeping with the rest of the narrative. They are also not necessary to the story, which could stand on its own as an admittedly less dramatic but no less moving tale of love and death and dogs.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greeceand thus out of keeping with the rest of the narrative.

US	52923654	R5FTCHGS5EBZC	0375701907	635714194	Straight Man: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	A Perfect Novel	I am not the kind of reader who regularly registers my appreciation of humor in books by laughing aloud. So it wasn't until chapter 28 of Richard Russo's Straight Man that I broke my silence. By that time the book's protagonist, William Henry Devereaux Jr., had landed in a situation too delightfully absurd for anyone, Mr. Devereaux included, to hold it in.<br /><br />Hank Devereaux is the acting chairman of a Balkanized English Department at an undistinguished university, the sort of place academics find themselves stuck in, La Brea Tar Pits-like, after the receipt of tenure and other of life's snares have eroded their ability to move on to better things. Hank is defined largely by what others perceive as his principal character flaw--he annoys his friends and family and makes enemies of his colleagues because of his failure to take most things in life seriously. He is, as a result, a very funny character.<br /><br />Hank is also a devoted if somewhat oblivious husband, the sort who depends on his wife to balance the check book (\\"Our portfolio, I'm to understand, is intact. This is good news. That we have a portfolio, I mean.\\"); and a sympathetic dog-owner (\\"I know and understand my dog well. We share many deep feelings.\\"); and a one-book author; and the son of William Henry Devereaux Sr., a literary critic and author more distinguished but less reliable than his son. In the course of the book Hank is beset by the academic infighting that attends a university-wide budget crisis, by animal rights activists incensed by his on-air near strangling of a goose and his threat of further fowl play, and by his inability to produce satisfactory quantities of urine.<br /><br />Richard Russo, on the other hand, is evidently the kind of man who cannot write a bad sentence. There are passages in Straight Man that demand re-reading, either because they are that funny or that well-written or because, for example, he has *so* captured the murderous annoyance that can come with wifedom and motherhood [pp. xiv, 136].

I was not disappointed. *The Basic Eight* is a gem of a book. It grows on you as you read, building eventually into a book that cannot be put down--particularly toward the end of October in the narrative--and it leaves you thinking about it long after you've read the last page.<br /><br />Mr. Handler, moreover, is a wonderful writer. The plotting of the book is masterful, and the pages are littered with beautiful, apt phrases/sentences--pearls, one might say--which one wants to linger over--over which one wants to linger. (For example, on p. 280: &#34;I craned  my neck to see who this person was, raised by wolves in some San Francisco wilderness and finally escaping by public transportation.&#34;)<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained of inconsistencies in the narrative over the figure of Natasha--I'll not be more specific, as this isn't a spoiler. But, while I haven't reread the book to verify that everything is thus explicable, I think the point is that the whole story is being told through Flan's rather unreliable perspective. Surely that is explanation enough?	2002-08-03

Was it not odd, for example, that, while Ralph *was* right in the end, the tension that was built up surrounding his character--his potential capacity for violence--never amounted to anything?<br /><br />And there's something else that troubled me about this book and about The Price of Salt: the attitude toward children implicit in them. Yes, yes, I know that this is fiction and the attitudes expressed do not necessarily express the attitude of the author. But I, at least, found the characters' distance from their children in both novels troubling and unrealistic. In Found in the Street the daughter is forever given to babysitters to raise, while the parents live almost as if they had never had a daughter in the first place: nightclubbing until all hours, and the mother went off on a trip for six months, we are told, when the kid was two, leaving the child with a grandmother for the duration. Perhaps Highsmith intended thereby to portray the parents in a certain light, but I wonder whether she found this sort of behavior remarkable or indeed realistic. In The Price of Salt, on the other hand, while one of the characters *is* broken up about not being able to see her daughter enough, I got the impression from the book that in the heirarachy of relationships, children rank below lovers.<br /><br />But perhaps I am missing something. I am curious about others' reactions.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2001-11-13

I'm working my way through the Ripley series (am currently into number five), and I think that *The Boy who Followed Ripley* is the best since *The Talented Mr. Ripley.* (Though the second and third in the series are  well worth the read, and besides, I wouldn't recommend skipping them, since  they provide background essential for fully appreciating the later novels.)  What a great character Tom Ripley is! We've seen it in previous books, but  here we see a lot of the tender side of Tom, who is really affected by his  relationship with the boy Frank. I also find his relationships with his  shady cronies interesting--they'll break the law regularly, but there is  indeed some honor in their relations with one another.<br /><br />The action of the  book  is indeed slow, as another reviewer mentioned, but I was struck while  reading it by how tense an atmosphere the author managed to create without  so much action. Always a sense of foreboding.<br /><br />Again, as another reviewer  mentioned, the action that does occur is perhaps not as well described as  it might be. I at least was confused about precisely what went on in the  apartment, the big action scene: the bad guys were going this way and that,  and seemed to give up without a fight, but I didn't quite understand  everything. Didn't detract from my enjoyment of the novel, however. And  before I log off I'll be ordering some non-Ripley Highsmith novels.	2000-03-27

The author tells a fascinating story about the importance of the spice trade in the history of the world and about the inhumanity which characterized the  Europeans' pursuit of the huge profits spices brought. Two points: (1) The  book might have been improved, I thought, by the inclusion of a  chronological outline: without writing one out myself while reading, I  sometimes found it difficult  to remember which expedition was under  discussion, especially since expeditions to the East sometimes overlapped.  (2) The title of the book suggests that the story will center around  Nathaniel Courthope's doings in the East, but in fact the story the author  tells is much broader in scope. For that reason I thought the name  *Nathaniel's Nutmeg* misleading.<br /><br />In addition to Dava Sobel's *Longitude,*  which another reviewer mentioned, readers may also find interesting Tom  Standage's *The Victorian Internet* and *The Professor and the Madman,* by  Simon Winchester.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece	2000-01-06
