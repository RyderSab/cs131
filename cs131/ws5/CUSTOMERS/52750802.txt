He truly makes history fun, not the dry boring stuff we had to do in school. And since I learn something when I read his books, it's just an added bonus.  I too read his first two books, and I think this one is my favorite--I love hearing how historical figures tricked and hookwinked each other over time.	2005-06-08

Tess is an engaging heroine, the plot moves along quickly, the romance is compelling and rewarding, and I found the hero to be a realistic, satisfying alpha male. I'll be looking for more books by Laura Drewry!	2005-04-20

Because it's a cd, and not a dvd, it may take some getting used to, especially for a total beginner.  But it comes with a set of cards which show you the correct poses.  What I like the best about it is that the cd lets you pick and choose the various sequences to create your own workout.  You can just go through the entire workout, or you can pick from various workouts they suggest, or you can create your own.  I like the instructor very much for the most part (she makes one comment about a \\"spinster aunt\\" which I find very offensive), and I find the level of difficulty perfect--not too hard, not too easy.  Plus, since I can basically create the workout I want, I can modify it to be as difficult or as easy as I want it to be.	2005-01-04

This workout is much more difficult than the beginners, and I felt was really an advanced yoga workout more than an intermediate one.  Plus, the sequences are so long, that you can't really shuffle and recreate your own workouts the way you can with the beginner version of Yoga in a Box.  I was really looking forward to owning this since I felt I had mastered the beginners version, but this version was pretty much a disappointment to me.	2005-01-04

This book is even funnier than Rules of Engagement.  Jenny Penny is a thoroughly appealing character and I love the premise of the Tingle Cream, which is just hilarious.  This book starts with a bang, and just keeps you turning pages until the very satisfying conclusion.	2004-12-16

The characters of the aunts are hilarious, I loved the premise that they thought the war manual was actually a handbook on how to get married, and I thought the hero was an absolute hunk.  I'm a bit baffled by some of the negative reviews I've been reading here--if you want a genuinely funny, page-turning romance with some real moments of tenderness, passion and love, this is the book for you.  I can't wait for the next one by this author!	2004-12-16

Those of us who do love dogs know the truth of their souls, and this book captures that, along with the true humor that is also dog.  A book for you, and for every dog lover you know.  I can't recommend it highly enough.	2004-11-17

Reading this book shows you what it is like to live with autism, Asperger's Syndrome in particular, and tells the story of how Dawn learned to cope, and even be happy, by observing a family of gorillas. If you are interested in the way the human brain works, and in the relationships between humans and animals, and about love and how it can save us all, you will truly love this book. To top it all off, Prince Hughes writes like a poet, and the immediacy of her prose makes reading this book a truly unique and special experience. Can't recommend this highly enough.	2004-07-22

Jayson Gallaway lives and writes the life every straight man fantasizes about--from having sex on rubber sheets with a stripper, to snorting viagra to have sex with his nymphomaniac girlfriend, to dancing at an S&M club.  You'll laugh until you cry.  For the Maxim crowd, but women will love this view into the male psyche as well--Jayson isn't a cad, just a guy with a healthy libido and a curious sexual appetite.	2004-07-08

Plus, the writing is excellent.  You won't want to put this book down.  The plotting is fast paced and creative, and you'll love the characters and want to find out what happens to them.  I was excited to find out from one of the reviews below that two more are in the works--can't wait to find out what happens next in the Bottom Dollar world.	2004-06-18

Books	5	17	17	N	N	The best book for busy moms--EVER	OK--you know those days when your kids want McDonalds and you're just too tired to argue?  You feel guilty as all heck, but let's face it, we've all been there, even super nutritionist moms, Janice and Liz.  So the first step of the book is where they tell you how to take the kids to Micky D's (and other fast food places )and give them the healthiest meals possible.  You'll be AMAZED by some of the differences between some of the menu options.  <br />The next step is frozen and prepared foods.  Again, we all feel so guilty every time we heat up those fish sticks and frozen peas, but Janice and Liz explain, right down to telling us what brands to use, how to make a really, really healthy meal out of frozen and canned foods.  <br />Finally, for those days when we finally do have some time, Janice and Liz make it so easy to cook easy healthy foods for our kids that they'll actually eat and LOVE.  They show us how to clean out our pantries so that cooking like this is easy, and no recipe takes more than 20 minutes.  <br />One of the best parts of the book is the companion website, where you can go, join the club, share recipies and anecdotes with other moms, and get more tips and advice from the monthly mom's newsletter by Liz and Janice--our national treasures!  Buy this book, join the club, tell your friends--or be sorry you didn't!	2003-12-26

No, this is not an in-depth history book, and thank goodness for that!

Now that she's married, she's cut back on the substance abuse, but she makes the details of grown-up life just as amusing and recognizable as she did life as a single idiot girl. As with Idiot Girls, Laurie writes for the rest of us--the ones who didn't get straight A's, who didn't get asked to Prom, who try to cover our rolls of fat with huge control top underwear a la Bridget Jones.  A wonderful, wonderful book.	2003-07-30

This is a wonderful, beautifully written, thoughtful, sexy collection of short stories about young women.  I found it a great antidote for all the silly lowest-common-denominator chick lit out there with the pictures of sexy legs on the covers.  This is all about women of our generation, but it's told with intelligence, wit, a bit of darkness and a bit of humor.  A wonderful collection--buy it!	2003-04-21

It seems so simple, but it's so easy to spend time on busy work, and avoid doing the work that will bring in the bucks.

Craig Wilson is a true master of nostalgia--his writing takes us back to simpler times, but without a trace of sentimentality and plenty of warmth and lyricism.

Hope Tarr has done the impossible, and created a sympathetic, very sexy hero who also happens to be a hangman. If that's not wild enough, he's also a virgin, and a vegetarian...and he can't stay away from the heroine, who has just escaped the French Revolution and has an understandable aversion to executioners.  I don't think I've ever read a book with such a creative hero and set-up and Tarr really makes it work, with lively dialogue, great action, and lots of passion and sexual tension.  This is a great follow-up to her wonderful first book, A Rogue's Pleasure.  Can't wait for her next one...	2002-05-10
