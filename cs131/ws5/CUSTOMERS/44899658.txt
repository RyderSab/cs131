The problem with this one is the way all this is done.<br />The book has three different stories combined in it, with all of them merging in the end. One tells us about the aftermath of World War III, with Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of Human warp propulsion, as the hero. The segment misses it's potential and is left predictable and messy.<br />A second story takes place shortly after the TOS episode \\"Journey to Babel\\", and deals with the aftermath of Kirk's encounter with Cochrane in the second season episode \\"Metamorphosis\\".<br />The third story is set right after the TNG episode \\"Sarek\\", and at first doesn't seem to have anything in common with the first two stories.<br />The book isn't that beliavable in it's way of bringing all these seemingly separate stories together. The scope of the story is epic, but the actual plot is far from it, as it deals with a surprisingly simple blood feud between Cochrane and his Arch enemy.<br />On top of that, Cochrane's character isn't being portrayed in a particulary interesting way, and is left flat and overly perfect, even though the book describes the bigger part of his whole life.<br />The TOS-era segment is the most interesting, as it provides good plotting and insightfull characterization. The TNG-era segment is more boring, even if it contains some surprises. The problems with this particular segment lies in the insufficcient and hollow characterization. The characters seem to resemble the ones from \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\", instead of the more deeper characters of the third season.<br />As a whole, the book is predictable an uneven, as it creates an epic crossover story out of thin air and leaves it's credibility under question.<br />The story is well stuctured, though, and the Reeves-Stevens have managed to make the story alive against all odds and provide a rare look into the history of the Federation, even if the story doesn't do justice to the premise.<br />Be ware, though, that \\"Federation\\" was written before \\"Generations\\", \\"First Contact\\" and the first episode of Enterprise, wich leads to some continuityu problems between it and the \\"death\\" of Kirk in \\"Generations\\" and the appearances of Cochrane and the invention of the warp drive in \\"First Contact\\" and \\"Broken Bow\\".<br />\\"Federation\\" is an ambitious story, with lots to offer, but insufficcient plotting and beliavability problems make it less than what it might have been.	2002-04-02

This resulted into \\"The Godfather\\", a tale about a fictional Mafia family in New York, the Corleones. The tale reached epic proportions as it told the tale of the family and people associated with it spanding decades and generations.<br />It all begins in 1947, when the leader of the Corleone family, don Corleone aka The Godfather falls victim to a murder attempt that has a big conspiracy at it's roots. This leads into a cunning plan from the part of the Corleoe family; a patient plan that takes years to reach it's full execution.<br />Puzo does an exellent job at creating several interesting characters as he plays with them to create a complex and ambitiuous plot that keeps the reader in it's hold as the Mafia world is described in a fascinating way, leading up to a truly action packed adventure.<br />Thar's what \\"The Godfather\\" is at heart; an action packed adventure. It's entertainment in it's purest form and if you want to read something profound and challenging, then this isn't the book.<br />Nevertheless the entertainment works well and we're left with a book written with talent and imagination, resulting into a functioning piece of entertainment.	2002-04-02

Curiously (and unexplainedly) enough, the phenomenon doesn't appear to effect any non-mechanical transformation of energy.<br />This causes strain between the Romulans and the federation, as they both suspect the disruptions as a new and powerfull weapon.<br />The book highly resembels Dave Galanter and Greg Brodeur's earlier Voyager novel Battle Lines in it's concentration on action instead of plot and characterization, wich ultimately leadst to rendering the book unrealistic.<br />This can be seen especially in the field of characterization. The characters feel familiar enough, and the duo writes them talentedly, but there are times in the plot that would absolutely require heavy and deep exploration of one or more characters, but don't contain any. And speaking of characters, Spocs inclusion in the story is as unjustified as it can get, as he has absolutely nothing to do and appears to be there only to fill the pages with his presence and comments that any other characters could have expressed. This I call a true waste of potential, wich appears to be the only real theme of the story.<br />The book succeeds in offering good science and sufficiently interesting original characters, though, and works at least somehow as a baggage of entertainment.<br />After all this the book still feels mediocore and cheap, and it leaves the reader with a feeling of being underestimated.<br />book II: Forever Dark<br />After the first \\"Maximum Warp\\" book, the second half of the duology starts off really promisingly.<br />The story holds together much better than in the forst book, there are more interesting siuations and even some sufficciently deepened character moments with both new and familiar characters.<br />But soon starts the downhill as plot gives it all away to action as long and uneventfull space battles and other action-packed scenes take over the story, the plot gets predictable and characterization is forgotten.<br />The ambitious but messy ending of the book ruins it all, as it stumbles on sci-fi clich√©s and overly melodramatic climax.<br />Leave the \\"Maximum Warp\\" duology to the bookstore and maybe borrow it from the library. It's not worth your money.	2002-04-02

The planet Eeiauo is devastadet by a plaque that hits it's feline inhabitants ones in a few deckades. Enterprise is called to the rescue as the disease starts to spread to other species as well and cannot be contained any longer.<br />As times starts to run out and every try to control the plague fail hope seemes to be lost.<br />To the rescue comes Uhura who knew an Eeiauoan closely once. Closely enough for that Eeiauoan to share the forbidden songs of her ancestors with our musically talented liutenant. Those songs might hold a cure for the plague as they imply to a dark secret that lies beneath a tabu about the Eeiauoan's hidden heritage...<br />Soon the actual premise of the story looses it's importance as it becomes only a means of telling a tale about a truly complex and intriguing alien culture, that might hold the keys to solving the mystery of the Eeiauoans.<br />The book is full of color and nuances as it sucks the reader into a hidden alien world and offers new insights to old, familiar characters as well as offers us many new ones, that are every bit as interesting.<br />The book is a masterpiece of writing, providing new perspectives and offering a tale told with vibrant and meaningfull language and exlemplary pacing.<br />We get to see growth, non-sentimental exploration of feelings and cultural peculiarities, creating an original angle for the reader to look from.<br />\\"Uhura's Song\\" is undoubtedly one of the very best Star Trek novels ever written, and a truly exellent piece of storytelling that I recommend to everyone.	2002-04-02

Unfortunately \\"Murder in Mesopotmia\\" appears to have given all it's strenght to that particulary ingenious story.<br />The narrator is Amy Leatherman, a young nurse who is asked to join an archeological expedition in Irak. The reason for this is the wife of the leader of the expedition, Louise Leidner, who's distressed because of mysterious letters with death threats contained in them. And it just happens that the threats seem to be something more serious than just practical jokes...<br />Christie leans on an obvious story instead of creating something truly original like she so often has. The murderer is pretty obvious and even the method isn't nearly as complex as you'd expect if you've read Christie before.<br />\\"Murder in Mesopotamia\\" is entertainment above all else and it doesn't contain any of the more deeper aspects Christie often includes in her novels.<br />Borrow it from the library if you like to read something light, but don't bother to by it, you probably won't need to read this one again.	2002-03-22

Books	4	15	20	N	N	Peculiar and original	When Michel Tournier is mentioned to someone, you often hear comments like: \\"Isn't that the author who could only write about human sexual perversions?\\", but if you examine his work more deeply, you'll see that there is a lot more to his writing than that.<br />\\"The Ogre\\" is his second novel and it starts by telling us the story of a French mechanic named Abel Tiffauges, living during the end of 1930's, who one day injures his right hand.<br />This fascinating novel is divided into six segments, from wich the first (and the longest) is the most fascinating, as it deals with this multi-dimencional character's past and present by the way of one year's worth of diaries wich he starts writing with his left hand after the previously mentioned accident. By the end of the segment this strange character of Abel Tiffauges with his peculiar habits and personality feels extremely real and deep, hence securing the feeling of reality of the whole artistically written book. Finally, the segment ends as Tiffauges stops writing after the beginning of the war between France and Germany.<br />The first segment is followed by three weaker segments wich, unlike the first one, are told in a traditional third-person narrating and are filled with surprisingly unlikely coincidences and forced events as they describe Tiffauges' journey through nazi-Germany, first as a French soldier, then as a prisoner of war, and finally a ranger.<br />Then the novel improves again as it gets to its fift segment, wich almost raises to the level of the first one. It shows us an itriquing transformation process, as, again by ridiculously not beliavable coincidences, Tiffauges ends up being an SS-officer and an instructor in a Hitler-Jugend training facility.<br />Step by step this first reluctant character grows more and more fascinated with anti-semitism and the complex scientific assumptions about racial differences. The segment is dark and unsettling, as the character is devided into two, when he can't separate reality with what he's been thought.<br />In the sixth and final segment the reader gets to witness Tiffauges' journey through chaos, as he experiences an enlightment that leads to his understanding of his own inner evil and eventually to self-destruction. This process is unevenly described, and not sufficiently explained, as it occurs suddenly and doesn't really lead anywhere.<br />The ending of the book is blurry, and it leaves the reader frustrated, as it leaves issues unfinished and not dealt with.<br />In the end \\"The Ogre\\" is a book that I recommend to anyone, even though many people will probably not like it as much as I did.<br />But weather you like it or not, don't leave it unfinished. Once you start it, you'll have to see it through.	2002-02-01

John Vornholt is a very two-faced star trek author, with the ability to produce ambitious and well written stories, while producing just as many naiv√© and brainless action adventures.<br />\\"Crossfire\\" is the purest example of the latter.<br />The main character is the drily portrayed younger version of Geordie LaForge, who works as a roadie for the Starfleet Academy Big Band, where the equally dimensionless younger version of Will Riker plays the trombone.<br />The book starts with the band traveling to a music competition on Pasifica, the much mentioned vacation planet of Starfleet officers.<br />The first half of this ridiculously short, but still overstrched story centeres around the question of the band winning or not, with tons of unnecessary and clumsy scenes filling the pages. The action begins as a bunch of Orios kidnapp the band.<br />Why?<br />Because they like the way they play, of course; no more, no less.<br />The band is taken to a planet where Orion troops are fighting as mercinaries in a war they've got nothing to do with, and the band is instructed to cheer them up. And of course the fighting begins just as they get there, leaving LaForge and Riker stranded together in the middle of a war zone.<br />Needless to say, the book has a discusting 'Happily Ever After'-ending, wich involves a lot of technobabble and a solution any reader can figure out aieons before the characters.<br />By the end of the book, I was truly perplexed by the question of how such a potential author could waste his time on something so utterly horrible.	2002-02-01

When it was first puplished back in 1992, it gained a great success in Norway, after wich it spread around the world.<br />I've got to admit that making a novel about history and philosophy can't be an easy job. You must make the information interesting, so that the novel works as a story.<br />Has Gaarder succeeded in this?<br />No.<br />&quot;Sophie's World&quot;, as is atmitted in the novel itself, is mainly just a philosophy study book for school students. It tells a story of a young girl named Sophie, who starts recieving strange letters from an equally strange philosopher, telling stories about philosophy and history.<br />The content of those letters is taken straight from a highschool philosophy book. They are dry and full of irrelevant trivia and dates, and on the top of that, those segments take approximately 80% of the whole novel, as the actual so-called &quot;plot&quot; advances with painstaikingly minor steps between the endless philosophy lectures.<br />The characters are horribly written. For example, Sophie can be described fully with the words: &quot;a 14 year old Norwegian girl who has never thought of ANYTHING even mildly profound&quot;. What I mean by this is that when she resieves the first letter from her instructor, that has only the question: &quot;Who are you?&quot; written on it, it's obvious she has never given one thought to her own identity. Similar questions like &quot;Since when has the world been there?&quot; are equally new to this 14 year old person, who's obviously spent all those years thinking everything but those basic philosophical questions we all start asking when we're little children.<br />Gaarder has written the whole novel to be reader underastimating, trying, in my opinion, desperately to give the impression he's somehow exeedingly smart and creative, when actually he's only achieved this very obvious illusion by breaking basic storytelling rules and creating story structures full of air. On the top of that, the ending of the book appeares to be taken out of nowhere, and doesn't at all seem planned and thought out of, wich frustrates the reader even more.<br />Don't get me wrong. &quot;Sophies World&quot; wasn't a wasted read. It gives loads of precise, if basic information about the history of western philosophy, adding names like Darwin and Freud, who are usually thought of only as groundbreaking scientist to the lot of great thinkers, even if it, to my great suprise, ignores Ockham and his nominalism, wich I personally consider to be quite a fascinating philosophical approach method.<br />&quot;Sophie's World&quot; is garbled and horribly paced, but an interesting book nontheless.	2001-12-07

It feels lake a TV-movie thriller set in the future.<br />But it is eventually made clear to the reader that the plot isn't the point of the book.<br />We have two characters: the hunter and the hunted. The hunter is a stereotypical main character, the hunted is anything but.<br />We get to peek at the landscape of an obnoctious mind, while following the story, and the all-too-familiar crime plot is maybe a necessary contrast to the overwhwlming richness of the more deeper aspects of the book.<br />The writing is exellent, and the book, though relatively old, isn't ruined by faulty science, because it's sosiological and psychological science-fiction, instead of aliens and robots etc.<br />There are a few comical science aspects, though, and the books has the ultimate &quot;And they lived happily ever after...&quot; ending, wich doesn't work even as a contrast to the intriquingly dark atmosphere of the book.<br />And after everything, as it ends, the book leaves the reader with a feeling that the book had had much more to offer than it did.<br />A classic, no doubt, but not as good as it might have been.	2001-09-28

The curious inhabitants of a quiet little village in England rush to the announced murder scene, and a mystery is started.<br />Christie describes the post-WW2 England intriquingly. We see a definite battle between the working class and the snobbish elite, as well as the suspicious and prejudisious wiev towards the jew refugees that went to England after the end of the concentration camp period, and one of the most contravercial aspects of the book is the possibly unkind description of a jew housemaid, who is supposed to bring humor to the story. This might very well shed some light to the after-war mentality in England.<br />The overall ethics are fortunately in place, though.<br />A recommendet, light, and entertaining, if predictable, little mystery.	2001-09-25

We have a story of a Klingon scientist, living on Earth, teaching, and a tale of one of his students.<br />As so often, the youngsters act at least five years younger than expected, are shallow and underestimated as characters.<br />The Klingon scientist on the other hand is written extremely well, but even he can't measure up to his pet kitten, who is clearly the best character of the entire spectrum of the characters introduced in this novel.<br />The setting is exellent, the writing good, characterization decent, but the plot leaves something to be desired for.<br />It's bases are ridiculously devoid of credibility, introducing a machine that can create energy out of nothing. And most ludicrous is the fact that it's created not in some top secret research lab, but at the inventors home, vithout the inventor even knowing what's being created. Whatever happened to the laws of physics and common sence?<br />All in all the kitten, the writing, and the use of good characters elevate this book into a decent one, that might have been exellent, if it had had at least a slightly intelligent plot.	2001-09-03

The last book in the Lost Years-series is definitely the worst one.<br />We get a book, that unlike it's predecessors, doesn't use the potential of the characters being out of a starship, in their own separate ways and situations.<br />The plot of &quot;Recovery&quot; might as well have been used in any other TOS novel. It offeres nothing but un-beliavabilities by introducing a 100% automated &quot;hospital-ship&quot;, that would be a technological marvel even in the era of Enterprise-E and Voyager in the year 2272.<br />The story is boring and predicteble. Beyond saving by the good writing of Jean Mary Dillard, who has written so much better book in her career that it's a real surprise to find her ending the series like this. We get only one important original character. The one we've seen a hundret times already: the young and eager cadet, who thinks Captain Kirk is a god and perfect in every way, and finally get's to meet him.<br />The book isn't really closely related to the other books of the series, but it can't hurt to read it as a bad ending.<br />At leas not much.	2001-09-03

Mix that with two-dimentional additional characters, magic, Tarod reading and prophesies, you get a slightly entertaining book with no credibility to back it off.

Not to mention that almost every chapter ends with a ridiculously artificial and forced cliffhanger, to wich every reader knows the end result by using a little bit of his or her brain. &quot;Spectre&quot; doesn't hold it's credibility because it's just so irritatingly superficial and immature.<br />In essence: the book is based on predictabilities and artificiality and it underestimates it's readers. I was constantly several pages ahead of myself while reading, simply because every solution to every problem though portrayed as a big surprise, was predictable and easily deduced. Not to mention the simply unproffecionally handled ending.<br />Then there's Kirk...<br />It is implied on the back cover that we can expect some real character development of Kirk. Similar as to the development shown on &quot;The Ashes of Eden&quot;, the first and so far the best of the Shatner &amp; Reeves-Stevens' books. But the character development goes along these lines: Kirks shoots a Klingon and thinks: 'I think... I feel... Just a little bit... Guilty... For taking... A life... Poor me!!&quot;<br />Furthermore... The Kirk of this book is portrayed like Wesley Crusher was at those terrible times when he was stillin the picture.<br />Time after time Kirk has amazing insights nobody else simply couldn't have thought of. He fights as bravely as humanly possible, always ready to sacrafice himself, saving the day when all the other characters seem to be just shadows compared to the shining light of their savior: James Tiberius Kirk.<br />Does the term 'Mary Sue' ring any bells?<br />&quot;Spectre&quot; doesn't fail nearly completely, though. It's still an entertaining and (overly) action-paced adventure, that just doesn't offer anything in terms of intellectuality.	2001-08-17

Due to the low mass of the &quot;planet&quot;, there is virtually no gravity, and the six very different species that inhabit it are constasntly &quot;flying&quot; through the chrystal formations.<br />Sounds like a fairy-tale?<br />Well, it is. But the childishness is an acceptable side-effect considering the ideal setting that produces it.<br />Unfortunately the story doesn't guite live up to the setting. We get the usual sabotage/murder mystery we have seen so many times we cannot remember. Unfortunately, the story is just as childish as the setting, and has nothing to back it off.<br />Fortunately the story is structured well, and the exellent use of Lt. Reginald Barclay and Commander Deanna Troi, who isn't usually portrayed in the way she deserves, not to mention the DS9 guest character Melora Pazlar, who, by the way, was originally created as the regular doctor of the series, and the exellent characterization of all of the three good characters makes this book, that takes place in the year 2376, one of the most entertaining ones in a long time. It's nice to see some more rarely used characters from time to time, instead the old and recycled TNG characters, that ,at this point, have absolutely nothing new to deliver.<br />But the writing.<br />The first few chapters of the book cause pain for the reader, because the writing of John Vornholt, who has proven himself to be quite a good writer, is absolutely unprofessional.<br />But in the end, I recommend this unique, and entertaining book, that offers the best mental wievs possible.	2001-08-13

Yes, the plot is virtually nonexistant, and the whole purpose of the book is to show us different Voyagers than the one we are used to. We get to follow two of these alternate Voyagers and their crew in this book, plus, of course, the 'regular' one.<br />Unfortunately, the only things that are different in these alternate Voyagers in relation to the familiar one are the uniforms, hairstyles and minor differences in the layout of the interior design of the ship.<br />The most annoying thing with this book is that it is a combination of few of the most popular Star Trek TV episodes and offers absolutely nothing new. It is apparent throughout the book wich episode is being copied with each scene.<br />The biggest strenghts of the book are good characterization, and especially each Janeway is being portrayed extremely well. The other one is the fact that our universe isn't any more prominently portrayed as the other ones. At least one other, that is.<br />The book doesn't take any risks. In fact it cannot take any risks. The ending becomes aparent after the very first chapters, and the novel isn't nearly as dark as it could, and probably should, have been.<br />Entertaining, but has all the bad characteristics Voyager is infamous for.	2001-08-13

Including the most annoying Star Trek character I've ever seen: Geoffrey Corin, the rich guy who bought his way to the academy. As if that would be possible in the world of Star Trek.<br />Cadet Forrester is written to be perfect. His hero Captain James T. Kirk (surprise, surprise...) is written as a god. It doesn't help one bit that the other characters are portrayed too stereotypically to feel real. Furthermore the relationships of the characters progress as if in a soap opera. Things are started, but never remembered afterwards.<br />The actual, weak and uniqually predictable, story of the book tells us the tale of a Federation-era Ku Klux Klan, and tries to make some points about racism, failing miserably.<br />The issue is over-simplified and underestimated, without even really touching the matter, by stating only the obvious = denying the importance of the issue, with the end result of hurting the very same important point the novel was probably trying to make.<br />The message of the book?

It is a necessary reading for anyone who watched the TV-series, since it offers so many answers so many wievers have been searching for. It gives you something to think about for days.<br />The characters are portrayed extremely well. Exept maybe for Sheridan and Delenn. They don't apear to be the best parents you could hope for, Delenn being overly protective and patronising, and Sheridan being... Sheridan. They both treat their son like he were several years younger than he is said to be, and maybe that's why he acts accordingly.

And while the first book was a mere grounding for the story, this novel has a solid story-structure, meaning the book is packed with twists and huge build-up that promises the story of your life, wich, by the way, is what you get from reading the last book of the trilogy &quot;Out of the Darkness&quot;.<br />The most impressive thing in this book, however, is the way Peter David, one of the most prominent Star Trek authors, and the writer of two Babylon 5 episodes, portrays the growth of the character of Vir Cotto.<br />'Growth' isn't actually the right term. 'Change' is.<br />Vir changes dramatically during the course of this book, and Mr. David does a remarkable job with holding the character together through it.<br />Yet again another definite must-read.	2001-08-09

And once again, he rises to expectations with this Babylon 5 trilogy that answers so many of the questions left unanswered during the TV-show.<br />This first novel of the trilogy is all about setting ground, characterization, and good writing, introducing many good characters and re-introducing some old ones, like two of Londo's wifes, seen in the second season episode &quot;Soul Mates&quot;, wich, by the way, was written by Peter David himself.<br />The book begins with the powerfull scenes from the fifth season episode &quot;The Fall of Centauri Prime&quot;, where Londo is taken controll over, and shows us the following five years, concentrating mainly on the situation of Londo, being controlled by the Drakh.<br />The book (the whole trilogy actually) gives us some remarcable insights of the character of Londo Mollari, wich really make you think about the character and analyse him in ways you maybe wouldn't have thought of.<br />Characterization is the whole purpose of the book. The plot kicks in in the even better followers of this book and especially the final book of the trilogy &quot;Out of the Darkness&quot; offers something few books do to a Babylon 5 fan.<br />But in the end you can't help but wonder if the novel could have had something more to offer.

The continuing presence of Deja Vu is very disconcerting. <br />As for the plot-twists in this book: they are rare and predictable, but the story doesn't grow boring because of the professional writing style of the authors. But even that doesnt eradicate the feeling of this book being written as a distraction, as if the authors didn't have anything better to do.<br />The other big problem turned out (once again...) to be the characterization. Once again we get a bunch of characters who have the same names and positions as our familiar TNG characters, but- with the possible exeption of Doctor Crusher and maybe Riker, who have prominent roles in the book- don't have anything else in common with their television counterparts.<br />In short: This was a readable TNG book that wasn't good or bad, packed with unfamiliar characters, but an all too familiar plot. If you don't know what mediocore means, read it. This is it at it's purest.	2001-08-06

Period.<br />That is one of the constants with working with a spinn-off series consept.<br />Star Trek: Klingon is a novelization of the CD-ROM with the same title, wich, I should note, I've never played. In the novelization Gowron tells the story of the CD-ROM at Quark's bar. He happens to be on DS9 because a Federation-Klingon peace negotiation just happens to take place there, and it also just happens that the crew of the Enterprise-D are present.<br />The novel doesn't offer any insight to the characters. Old or-Universe forbit-new. And- most dissapointingly- we learn absolutely nothing new about Klingons.<br />In fact the story could as easily have been told without involving DS9 as the setting of the storytelling sessions or the Enterprise crew as additional and useles characters, and those aspects of the novel seem to hold no purpose whatsoever. So in the end it became apparent that they were only includet to show DS9 and TNG cast work together, wich they really don't even do.<br />I have nothing against crossovers between the series. On the contrary. But there must be some logical reason to unite the different series. Star Trek: Klingon doesn't offer any.<br />For example; one of the few things the makers of Voyager did right was to show what happened in the alpha Quadrant conserning Voyager after they found out about it being whole and relatively well in the Delta Quadrant.<br />They needet a boost in ratings, and they managet to make a succesfullm crossover, because the characters involved with Voyager on Earth were Lt. Reginald Barclay, and through him, Commander Troi. It wasn't forced crossover. It was continuity.<br />I admit that as far as the stories went, the characters needen't have been our familiar TNG friends, but it was much less obvious than that horribly written appearence of Scotty in- analytically- one of the worst episodes of TNG: &quot;Relics&quot;, the best example of desparately pathetic attemts of continuity andgrounding a weak story completely in the appearance of a familiar face.<br />Star Trek: Klingon was even worse. There wasn't even a forced reason to unite the crews. Backed with an entertaining, but short and aimless story containing no real insight on the Klingon mind and culture, missing characterization, and endless clich√©s, we get a Star Trek books that hasn't got anything to do with the potential in creating a Klingon based story.	2001-08-06

Shortly after the episode 'Cardassians', if you can count on the stardates.<br />It's writer Dafydd ab Hugh, is one of the most contraversial star trek writers I have read. He writes good characterization and interesting situations, but his books are filled with commercial, brainless, unjustified and ridiculously violent action. <br />I have nothing against a little action, but it must be justified and portrayed realistically. This novel is totally based on violence. The unjustified and unrealistic kind at that. <br />Fortunately the characters are portrayed well, and this is one of the what-if stories, that are fitted into the established canon by time travel. It's, in a way, a DS9 version of the exellent Voyager episode 'Year of Hell', so it's a story that normaly wouldn't be told, unless it would have been told as non-canon. <br />And I hate trek stories that don't fit to the established canon. <br />All in all, the book is good. It gives us an entertaining story, but some even a bit intellectually talented fans might not like the war-movie storytelling. Definitely recommendet, but a story that might as well have been left untold.	2001-04-10

The story has many twist in it, and the book is extremely visual, making it an entertaining book to direct in your mind. <br />The book had one dissapointment, though. It was the fact that it centered too much around the characters that, perhaps, are allready overused in the show. But those characters were fortunately portrayed extremely well. <br />And one more complaint goes to the unbeliavably unintelligent and ridiculous storyline, that shows our own cave-man Commander William Riker trying to make matters better by kikking some Romulan butt on the holodeck. It was like watching a Hollywood action film.<br />But if you're looking for good characterization and story that feels exactly like an episode of TNG (if not better), this is the book.	2001-04-10

First of all, they are way too short. <br />Secondly: the characters are teenagers. I am 15 myself and that's probably the biggest reason I don't like young characters (in anything). <br />Why? <br />Because they act about 3 to 5 years younger than they should (in Wesley Crusher's case: about 10). <br />The starfleet academy books, in general, have been fairly believable in this field, although the characters still sometimes feel a bit immature. <br />This particular book uses characters that behave, in my opinion, like people behave when they are about 12 years old. Plus they are complete stereotypes. <br />For example the teamleader is a young male human who has joined starfleet because of his father. (Has anyone ever joined becase of his/her mother, brother, sister cousin...?)<br />I bought this book in hopes of a view to the character of Geordi LaForge, but to my dissapointment he was characterized poorly, and didn't even feel like the main character. <br />The plot was weak, the storytelling predictable... It's barely readable, but dont waist your money on it.	2001-04-09

We had many TNG episodes concentrated around this very theme, but it's a question that, if properly adressed, will always be worth asking. <br />&quot;Spartacus&quot; is set in season four after the episode 'Brothers', but, if I recall correctly, befor Wesleys departure in 'Final Mission'. <br />The book is relatively original, containing many good scenes in interesting settings. The story advances smoothly, and gives room to many characters, making them disagree openly with each other. <br />I ecpecially liked the fact that Data didn't steal the whole show, while being a prominent character. I think star trek books should give more room to less explored characters, and Spartacus is much better in this field, than many other trek novels. <br />The characterization is a bit troublesom, though. The novel shows many characters as much more concervative as they are in the series, and makes Federation sound almost like a bunch of snobs, who don't care about anything important or even mildly profound. Also I think the subject of the novel would have had much more to give than we got from this good novel, wich made me think, but had a dissappointing and somewhat not believable ending. <br />A good test of youre openmindedness wich, at least in my opinion, is pretty much 'what being a star trek fan is all about.'	2001-04-05

The quality of her work varies astronomically. This novel, wich is set somwhat after the episode 'Cost of Living', offers character exploration in it's best. <br />The book puts the characters under telepathic influence, makin it possible for the deepest aspects of their psyche to surface. <br />One of the affects is that the Enterprise crew isn't a one big happy family anymore, but is facing a situation where all the family members don't necessarily get along. This is done with great expertice and not compromising the believability of the characters one bit. They are not different in any way and every bit as real as they are in the TV series. Maybe even more real. <br />The book does also a wonderfull job in promoting characters left aside in the series. Deanna and Worf are slightly more prominent characters than the rest, and ecpecially Deanna is portrayed extremely well. Worf also gets some extremely good scenes. <br />This book shows the battle between open mindet and concervative views as portrayed by the intellectual Counselor Troi and the 'primal' Liutennant Worf, and does this with respect to both of thr characters. <br />Although Troi and Worf are heavily portrayed, this book explores many of the main characters of TNG. And does that very well. The plot though, while intriquing, isn't as good as it might have been, but it holds well. <br />A recomendet read.	2001-04-05

This was undoubtedly one of the best books I've ever read. <br />It was an amazingly epic tale about the the Romulan culture, Spock and the greatly missed Saavik, and the best thing is that the book is set in the 24th century, but before TNG, combining the Romulan society of Diane Duane's Rihannsu series and the one shown on TNG, hence making this a very original and informative star trek novel. <br />That was a satisfying surprise to me, since the prequel; &quot;The Vulcan's Forge&quot; was such a dissapointment. But the writing style that made that previous book hold out helped to make &quot;Vulcan's Heart&quot; one of the best reading experiences of my entire life. <br />The book doesn't seem follow a so called writing-formula. It hasn't got any ups and downs. <br />Just ups. <br />It made the same extremely gratifying peek-feeling you get from a few good books, but always at the near end, last through the whole book. <br />This novel was at the climax of the storyline from the first pages up until the end. If you haven't bought this book already do so now, or miss something quite unique.	2001-03-22

The time to get there with maximum warp would be measured in decades. <br />This was, if I recall correctly, the very same error that made Gene Roddenberry declare the fifth movie non-canon.

Not perfect, but holds well. <br />The book is written in a way that makes it feel like a motion picture, a style the writers seemes to prefer and they use it damn well. This is one of the reasons I can say that &quot;The return&quot; is definitely better than First Contact. <br />I do admit though, that te new Shatner books are a bit commercial. People didn't want to see Kirk die, so the Pocked Books desited to take advantage of that. Too bad you can see it so clearly while reading. <br />Fortunately the book answeres some questions that have been in the fans' minds for a long time. <br />There are some continuity problems however, but they aren't too aparent.

First of all, I enjoyed this book very much. <br />It was fun, entertaining and I recomend it.

The book tried an action based start, but didn't do it wery well, just as I just didn't.:) <br />The book contains much action and maybe even crosses some borders of good writing, by using action as the only intrique, thus making the novel appear unintelligent, meaningless and commercial. <br />But in a way this was a good change from the usual trek, although Voyager has been known to use action as a commercial tool on TV also, wich I think has injured the series' integrity and credibility. <br />This book however goes even further, using the characters only as action heroes, but, also building those same characters in a way rarely seen on books and doing it, in some instancies well, and in some instancies not so well, often making the characters &quot;harder&quot; than they are. <br />This, however, is easily forgivable and unimportant for the plot, only annoying. <br />All in all I recomend this book for all Voyager fans.

My only complaint is that, at times, it almost resembled a 'teenage' book made for people who like to wach 90210, and although that kind of thing normally makes me burn the book, in this one it wasn't nearly as prominent as in the worst case it could have been. <br />If you like Voyager and Janeway one bit you must read this book and also it's sequel Pathways, wich isn't quite as good as Mosaic, is also a definite must-read nontheless.	2001-03-12

But at least that story made a point in telling about Jeri Taylor's open minded opinions, wich I think are a sign of trully understanding what star trek was originally about (besides a TV series to make clean money...). <br />I just hope we could get similar novels of each of the characters of trek.

This book was a bit of a dissapointment for me. <br />The beginning offers the book to be full of either interesting opportunities or huge dissapointments. It was neither. <br />The plot was intriquing and the book kept you with it, but there was not enough pay off at the end, as the author fell back on old, predictable solutions and colorless writing.<br />A nice read but nothing is missed by not reading it either.	2001-03-08

In short: simply something that fit well, but was too risky to be tried earlier. It's completely absurd, twisted and surreal and by all means I do not recomend this to everyone, but I found it original and risk-taking enough to give it five stars,wich I dont often do.	2001-03-08

US	44899658	R3VNDC9OR8XGGD	0671007335	353655953	Quarantine (Star Trek Voyager: Starfleet Academy No. 3)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Too short	This was a good book that did good job in the field of characterization and decent one at the field of plotting. <br />It was however much too short. <br />Fortunately, the author who however held the book well in order, as she described the layers of Janeway's character with the help of an unoriginal, but well executed plot. <br />If you like Janeway ,and even if for some uncompehendable reason you dont; read it.	2001-03-08

Although a bit soapy the book was an original insight to the characters of Worf and even Commander Riker wich in my opinion only Peter David can make sound anything else but an undeveloped megalomaniac without changing the character completely. That compensated for the minor lapses in plot that was very satisfactory for the most part, at least. <br />Deanna Troi, on the other hand, was strangelly annoying. <br />This is a character greatly missunderstood by many, making her sound like a stupid, overemotionall, prom princess, wich I think she definitely is not. Her strong side is hugely ignored by many authors by, for example, leaving her out of fighting scenes. <br />There's a huge potentiall there wich Mr. David has often used, but in this book she was nothing else but an object to be saved from the bad guys and that actually hurt the story, with Troi supposedly not being the unexperienced psychology student she was in Imzadi I. <br />You should read this book if you read the first one, by the way, because it at least tries to repair the inconsistancies between that book and the TV series, although it's too hard for even Peter David to handle well enough. In short: an original book that does justice to the series.	2001-03-08

But don't by it. Thats all I have to say about this one.	2001-03-08

Both characters intiguing and not enough explored in the series. <br />The plot seems a bit lame, although I admit that that might partially be because we all pretty much know the ending.<br />Nontheless, it was interesting to read more about Anna Sheridan, Morden and their connection to the planet Za'ha'dum and the shadows. <br />A good read that offers essential information regarding the TV series. And that pretty much repairs the lacks in the storyline, wich aren't that tremendeous anyway. As I said before: By it!	2001-03-08
