IT seems like the author got lazy at the end or could not figure out what he wanted to do with it so he just copped out and left a lot of loose threads untied. I have seen some people comparing this to Robert R McCammons Boy's Life. Do be fooled Boy's Life is vastly better. This is not even in the same league.	2003-01-17

Well this book pretty much shatters that image, yes Walt was involved in every picture Disney made and he had the final word, but there were so many talented artists and writers that got no credit whatsoever and without them Disney would not be what it is today. It is a private look at man that is both willing to show he genuis as well as his faults as a human being.	2001-05-01

It does provide some pretty interesting information concerning the reactions of the public when certain Disney films were released (like potheads loving to go to Fantasia and Alice In Wonderland while being stoned for the cool trip). However the other information seemed kind of repetative but a good way to pass the time.	2001-05-01

The trip is full of danger and to make things worse the are being attacked by skinwalkers. I was entertained not as much as the Relic but still pretty good.	2001-04-06

It is a throwback to It,and Tommyknockers and I enjoyed it much more than both of those. In a nutshell the story is about 5 friends, one having Downs Syndrome who is also a powerful Phychic, He in a way passes his gift along to his 4 friends who must use their skills to survive an alien invasion while hunting in the woods. It is very scary at times at really gross to (which is good to some people :)). In closing I will say you will never be able to sit on the toilet without thinking twice again.	2001-04-02

Like a lot of people from my generation I was convinced by Hollywood that the Vietnam war was lost by America. While it may be true that the war as a whole was a failure it is plain from this book that the individual battles were a victory for the U.S. almost every time if you count in enemies killed. The accounts of heroism are awe inspiring I knew some Vietnam vets growing up and after reading this book I have gained a greater respect for what they did and the heros they are. A great book I absolutly reccomend.	2001-01-22

I remember when I first read the the Tomb I was amazed and  have been anticipating a new chapter ever since. This book did not  dissapoint. My favorite chapter without giving to much away was Jack's  booby trapped hideout and the suprises that it held in store for the thugs.  I only had two minor gripes. I wish there was more of a supernatural  element to the story like in the Tomb but that is just a personal  preferance, also the relationship between Alicia and the cop never really  seemed to have a purpose, it was all set up and had your interest but then  it just dissapeared. Anyway read the book you will be entertained.	2000-08-08

If  you have any aspirations in this field this should be required reading. It  will quickly shatter any romantic notions you may have about the filmaking  process and teach you what to expect.

I think it could have been better it  just seemed like a rush job in order to make a sequal to the movie. I did  enjoy the new dinosaurs though it was quite exciting to see them in action.	2000-05-23

Unfortunalty  for him the only way out is across Siberia and over the Bering Streight.  Great story and great plot the only complaint I have is it tends to be kind  of slow in some parts.	2000-05-23

I liked this book and the whole overall plot but it just took to long to get to the point. The plot is one of the Wee Folk is haveing nightmares about a crystal tower and a green sea. Influenced by the dreams she goes on  a quest to find her missing lover who is somehow sending these dreams to  her. The story has some good action sequences and the story moved along  enough to keep my interest to the end. I have to complain about the  political influences I don't want to read how evil man is and how he is  detroying the environment when I read a fantasy novel.	2000-05-22

Whomever could give this book a bad review either has no attention span or no apprciation of good writing. I have read this book at least 3 or 4 times and I never get tired of it. If you are avoiding this book because you  think you know the story from watching movie versions then ou are missing a  lot I have yet to see a movie that can do the book justice. Read it!	2000-05-22

When Upton Sinclair wrote it he meant it to be an example of how capitalism will corrupt and that socialism should be the preferred social setting. It was a complete misfire  though and it only served to expose the disgusting conditions in the meat  packing industry which eventually led to the creation of the FDA. Upton  Sinclair considered the book a failure. I would have to agree with the  reaction at the time. the meat packing scenes were the most memorable the  rest was a complete chore to read.	2000-05-22

I know a lot of the other reviewrs have been dissapointed by this but I just could not put it down. It shows us a facinating look at medevil life and you really feel like you have been  there. The plot is great and well paced and the technical data that Chriton  fans love is there. Check it out.	2000-05-19

It reads like a Hitchcock movie	I found this at my local library I since I am a Matheson fan I gave it a try. It is very reminescint of Hitchcock's falsey accused man on the run theme. It has some very good twists and will keep you guessing until the  very end. I was pleasently suprised by this book so if you can find it give  it a try.	2000-05-18

This book reveals where his inspirations come from. I especially enjoyed the section on the screening  of American Grafiti where Francis Ford Coppla and the producer got in a  shouting match. It also has an interesting prview of sorts for the Prequels  as this was written long before Phantom Menace was released.	2000-05-18

For one it just was not scary to me. I mean if a good looking girl ghost all a sudden appeared and she wanted to have sex with me  well I just don't see that as a horrifying experiance. I would recommend it  only if you are a die-hard Matheson fan.	2000-05-18

The dialog is so lame and the way Hunter is charactorized is just a bit over the top to believe. And the plot is a mix  of  Dean R Koontz's Watchers and Predator. This book is good for a  distraction but definatly not the kick--- book others say it is.	2000-05-18

If have read Tad Williams Memory Sorrow &amp; Thorn series you will see a lot of similarities. Don't let the cats on the cover scare you  away this is just a straight up fantasy story using cats instead of people.	2000-05-18

I popped it in the old discman and listned as I drove. The first story Lunch at the Gotham Cafe was entertaining but nothing special same with the  third story. But the second story 1408 holy cow! I have not been that  creeped out by a story for a long, long time.  If you are a King fan you  have got to read this story. It caught me totally unaware of how disturbing  it would be and it scared  me so bad I slept with the lights on. This one  will grab you Mr. King is such a talented writer he makes you feel you are  going insane right along with Mike. Read it! Alone in the dark if you dare!	2000-03-17

After that it quickly loses steam. When I buy a Stephen King book I expect to be frightened if not that at least to be entertained. This book did not fufill  either desire. I am dissapointed that King did this to his fans who expect  a lot more out of him. I wonder if he thinks because he is so succesful  that he can just crank out anything he wants and people will just lap it  up. Mr King please stick to horror what your good at if I want to read  about the sixties I'll read a history book.	2000-03-09
