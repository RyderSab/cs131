With the discovery, however, comes horror: the man who discovers the fossil is assassinated, and Tom Broadbent and his wife Sally, who are in possession of a journal detailing the location of the fossil, are next on the hit list.<br /><br />But there are powers at work that the Broadbents could never imagine; there are people who will do anything, absolutely anything, to get ahold of that fossil.  Because within the preserved remains of the T-Rex is a secret so astounding, so deadly, that it may spell the end of human life as we know it.<br /><br />\\"Tyrannosaur Canyon\\" is another rivetting solo effort by Douglas Preston, who has written numberous high-caliber thrillers with co-writer Lincoln Child (who is also enjoying solo success with his well-written suspense novels).  Preston's book does have its flaws, of course: the plot, at times, seems forced; there are major characters who disappear too suddenly, with the reasons given seeming like afterthoughts; and there are characters who are not drawn to their potential.  And yet, at the root of this novel is a good ol' adventure story, one that will also intrigue dinosaur buffs (who haven't had a REALLY good dino-themed thriller since \\"Jurassic Park\\").  Not the best thriller in the world, but certainly an enjoyable one, \\"Tyrannosaur Canyon\\" is a great novel for you to lose yourself in.	2005-10-04

He writes letters--and his letters get results.  If he writes a complaint letter to a theme park, he gets free passes.  If he writes an editorial scathing the president's economical plans, he gets a responding letter from the president himself.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Jason Hanford was born to write...and someone out there knows this.  Jason begins to receive mysterious letters, detailing dreams he has had, horrible nightmares that seem all-too-real.  When Jason's life begins to spiral downwards, when his marriage ends in divorce and seperation from his wife and child, when he loses his job and is danger of losing his home...Jason gets a job offer.  From someone who wants him to do nothing but that thing he feels most compelled to do: write letters.  It is a job that will change Jason's life...and may very well COST him his life.<br /><br />\\"Dispatch\\" is yet another rivetting, satirical, shocking novel by the always-enjoyable Bentley Little.  The ending is a bit predictable for Little's die-hard fans, but that's okay--we really don't care that much, because it's the ride UP TO the ending that we're most interested in.  And what a thrill it is!  \\"Dispatch\\" will keep you turning the pages until the very end...where you may even feel compelled to go back and read it all over again.  With the lights on, of course.

You could leave your doors unlocked.  You could go down to the creek and catch crayfish.  You could play a game of baseball with the neighborhood kids.<br /><br />You could trust your neighbors.  Most of the time.<br /><br />Two sisters have just moved in next door, living with their aunt after being orphaned.  To young David, this is great--his best friends live there, their mother Ruth is wonderful, and David is infatuated with one of the girls, Meg, innocent and beautiful.  It seems too perfect--it is.  For Ruth is slowly descending into madness, building up a horrible rage that she will unleash upon Meg, and David will be forced to come to terms with himself, and confront an evil that is all-too human.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Next Door\\" is one of those books that you read, you put down, and though you may never read it again, you will remember it.  Jack Ketchum is, if nothing else, honest--he has proven it in other books, and this modern-day horror classic stands as the ultimate testament to that fact.  It is a grisly, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking glimpse at madness and child abuse, and it will leave you pondering your own morality.  Ketchum is the master of the non-supernatural horror novel, and \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is one of the best of that genre.  You may not enjoy this book--it is NOT for the faint of heart--but you will not forget it, I promise you.  And that is what makes a classic.	2005-08-27

For Victor never stopped making new people--his terrifying \\"New Race.\\"  He has created what he THOUGHT was the perfect person...until things go wrong.<br /><br />The New Race, created to be loyal unto Victor and to not believe in God or any form of supersticion, begin having doubts.  The New Race are designed not to kill unless ordered by their creator to do so; but their lust to kill (for they hate human beings) is becoming uncontrollable.  And several members of the New Race are changing into unthinkable monstrocities, with the sole desire to destroy and wreck havok.<br /><br />As O'Connor, Maddison, and Deucalion race to stop Helios's evil plans, they must face the reality that they are too late: that events have been set in motion that may kill everybody in the city of New Orleans...and possibly the rest of the world.<br /><br />It's a corny idea, to be sure; but then, Koontz has never been afraid to go out on a limb.  And, truthfully, only he could turn this ridiculous notion into a horror/suspense novel that's not only readable, it's right up there with his best.  Co-written by Ed Gorman (another brilliant horror/suspense writer), \\"City of Night\\" picks up where the first novel left off, and will leave readers hanging on the edge of their seats for the final installment (which doesn't come out for another year, unfortunately).	2005-08-05

However, Duane doesn't return, prompting Sherry to go out after him.  Who she finds, however, is Toby Bones--a disturbed teenager who has a crush on Sherry...a crush that is about to become something more.  Something horrifying.<br /><br />What ensues is 400+ pages of pure adrenaline, as Sherry puts up with Toby, as she plots her revenge.  If nothing else, what \\"Come Out Tonight\\" has going for it is a strong female lead.  And there is something truly terrifying in the character of Toby Bones...almost as if he's been ripped from the latest news headlines.  What holds the novel down are the supporting characters, most of whom are annoyances...you almost wish Toby will jump out of the shadows and hack them up with butcher knives.<br /><br />Laymon has always drawn a following of readers who expect gore, sex, and a tale as dark as the deepest cave.  Well, they get it here.  However, for those of you not into that sort of thing (I'm not), Laymon has an attribute that most of fiction's greatest writers aspire to: he makes everything suspenseful.  There's not a page of this novel that won't pique your curiousity, making you want to turn the page to see what'll happen...and, usually, it's something unexpected.  Laymon never fails to deal with the darkest parts of human nature (in his heroes AND villains), and \\"Come Out Tonight\\" is a perfect example of that.  Not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach, but a gripping, thrilling ride for those who dare to give it a shot.	2005-07-19

He and his wife adopt a child.  They live happily.  But Vassago is closing in.  He, too, is aware of the connection with Hatch, and he would relish the opportunity to ruin Hatch's life, and kill everyone he loves...<br /><br />\\"Hideaway\\" is one of Koontz's all-time best...and also, as he points out in the new afterword, the first to receive hate-mail.  Still, don't let a few letters get you down; \\"Hideaway\\" moves along at breakneck speeds, like most of Koontz's books, and features characters that are so real, you are genuinely afraid for--or of--them.

Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast has been freed from his tomb inside an Italian castle (let's face it, we all knew he wasn't dead).  However, he and his friend, NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta, have no time for celebration.  For Pendergast must face an evil that has haunted him for years, and which has now arisen to take its vengeance: his long-lost (and thoroughly evil) brother, Diogenes.<br /><br />Diogenes is no ordinary criminal; he is, in fact, quite possibly the only person smarter and more cunning than Pendergast himself.  And he is bent on destroying Pendergast, by murdering friends old and new, and framing the FBI agent.  But Diogenes's twisted brilliance does not end there.  For behind his crimes lies a motive so unthinkable, so inhuman, that it can only come to one outcome: death.<br /><br />\\"Dance of Death\\" is one of the fastest-paced thrillers I have read in a long time.  Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child continue their well-researched, exhillerating brand of suspense featuring the popular Special Agent Pendergast.  An added bonus for longtime Preston/Child fans: the return of characters such as Margo Green and Bill Smithback (both from the duo's first novel, \\"Relic\\"), Nora Kelly (from \\"Thunderhead\\"), and Laura Hayward (from \\"Reliquary\\" and \\"Brimstone\\"), plus the occasional mention of minor characters from other previous novels.<br /><br />But \\"Dance of Death\\" is more than just another Pendergast novel.  It serves almost as the second act in a three-act play (with \\"Brimstone\\" being the first act).  It tidies up just enough to leave the reader satisfied, while leaving enough questions unanswered to ensure that those who read this novel will rush out and get the next one.  Of course, Preston/Child fans will do that anyway, because they know that with this duo, you get nothing less than the best.  Want proof?  Here's \\"Dance of Death,\\" the perfect book to keep you awake all night.	2005-06-16

Not the supernatural horror type of \\"The Rising\\" and \\"City of the Dead\\" (at least, it mostly isn't), \\"Terminal\\" is the story of Tommy O'Brien, a loving father and husband, who finds out he has cancer--terminal.  The doctors give him a month, three at the most.  Tommy suddenly finds himself staring at death, wondering how his wife and son will carry on without him.  The small town of Hanover is stricken with poverty, divided into three camps: those who listen to rap, those who listen to metal, and those who listen to country.  Everyone is poor.  Tommy can't even pay the bills...and that's before he gets laid off from his job.<br /><br />What is a man to do?  If you are a small-town worker with nothing to lose, you decide to take care of your family.  And Tommy starts eying the town bank.  With the help of two friends--John and Sherm--Tommy is about to pull off the ultimate bank heist.  Except things inevitably go wrong, especially when one of your friends doesn't know what he's doing, and the other is homicidal...and Tommy will meet up with a young boy, a little kid who can do extraordinary things, and may just be able to cure Tommy...if Tommy can keep him alive.<br /><br />\\"Terminal\\" takes the most suspenseful novel you've ever read, and jacks it up a couple hundred notches.  Rivetting, narrated by a guy most of us can relate to, this is a novel that will scare your pants off, and yet make you think about what YOU would do, when you had nothing to lose.  Brian Keene has proven himself willing to tackle subjects that most authors won't dare approach, and he does it yet again in \\"Terminal.\\"  This is one that will appeal to the general suspense fans, as well as those who liked Keene's earlier novels.  A sure-fire winner.	2005-06-14

Meanwhile, Ezra Metzger has discovered (rather, stolen) an ancient scroll, which depicts an epic battle...between angels.<br /><br />And when the fossil comes to life, and the creature within is freed upon New York City, all hell will break loose.  Because this creature is older than time itself, with no soul whatsoever.  And it has one goal in mind: acquire a soul of its own, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Masello's novel is not the fast-paced, James Rollins-esque adventure the packaging suggests; it is instead a slower, more thought-provoking novel, built on suspense and interesting characters (especially the villain, Arius).  Not a flawless book by any means (there's little scientific or theological evidence to support it, not that anybody really cares), it is still rivetting, and will keep you glued to the last page.	2005-06-12

While true horror fans such as myself probably enjoyed it (if only because of the guts it took to do it), light-hearted fans took offense and demanded a sequel.  So Keene, being the good author, wrote one.  Don't worry, though: he readily asserts that it is HIS book and HE is in charge, and if he wants this dark, things are gonna be dark.<br /><br />Jim Thurmond has crossed three states to rescue his son, Danny (who, yes, is alive and well).  With him are an elderly but valiant preacher named Martin and a former prostitute-turned Amazon warrior Frankie.  Rescuing Danny from his home (and evading a small army of zombies), the trio escapes into Manhattan, where they take refuge with a few other survivors holed up in a fortified skyscraper run by an insane billionaire and his brave (but frightening) head of security.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the zombies mass.  Leading them is a spirit named Ob (pissed off that, though he was mentioned 17 times in the Old Testament, humans don't know who he is).  Ob and his brethren are angry at God, and determined to kill every single human on Earth.  They've mostly accomplished that goal; there are only a few holdouts left, including about 200 peolple in a certain New York skyscraper, one Ob is determined to level to the ground...<br /><br />\\"City of the Dead\\" fairs wonderfully as a sequel.  It's sort of like a guilty pleasure, picking up where the characters left off in \\"The Rising\\" (the first chapter of this book is the last chapter of that book).  Yet, there's something missing here that \\"The Rising\\" had...originality, maybe.  Nothing can be done about that, of course--sequels are inheritently un-original.  Still, there're a few letdowns here, but nothing that will hinder your enjoyment of this horrific read by one of horror's most promising authors.ll hinder your enjoyment of this horrific read by one of horror's most promising authors.	2005-06-09

But not all nightmares occur during your sleep; sometimes, as Billy is about to find out, you are awake.<br /><br />It starts with a note on the windshield of his car, informing him that he much choose, through his actions, who dies: if he goes to the police, an elderly charity worker will die; if he does not go to the police, a young schoolteacher will be killed.  Billy does nothing, and a young blond schoolteacher ends up brutally murdered; thus begins a game where Billy is forced to choose who dies, all the while dealing with his own guilt over his actions, and trying to find out the mastermind toying with him.  It's all leading toward a countdown, an inevitable and unavoidable sacrifice that Billy must make: himself, or the one whom he loves the most.<br /><br />The word \\"velocity\\" means speed in a particular direction.

Corey and his new wife, Kate, have just visited the five-year anniversary of the \\"accident.\\"  But in going to the anniversary, doubts are raised in Corey's mind: was it really an accident?  What about that \\"red streak\\" that hundreds of people claimed to have seen...a streak that was inevitably comparable to a rocket...<br /><br />Thus Corey begins his investigation into a five-year-old, closed case.  Only a detective of Corey's skill could uncover something...especially with the pressure being put upon him to stop.  But as Corey gets deeper and deeper into his investigation, his chances of escaping unscathed decrease.  And soon, it will be Corey's quest for the truth, vs. the government's habit for conspiracies.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away here; people who've read DeMille's novels know that he has a habit of coming up with original, surprise endings.  He outdoes himself here.  Corey's quest climaxes in an inevitable--and yet entirely unforseeable--way.  Gut-wrenching.  You won't forget it.<br /><br />\\"Night Fall\\" is probably DeMille's best novel yet.  It's well-researched, and yet open-ended enough so that you are allowed to make up your own mind about the tragic evening of July 17, 1996.

Once, a young author used to write science fiction novels, and dreamed of becoming a science fiction superstar.  That young author?  Dean Koontz.  Just because he became famous for suspense thrillers doesn't mean he lost his sci-fi edge.  It's appeared in many of his books (and in many of his #1 bestsellers).  And it rears its fascinating head in \\"The Taking.\\"<br /><br />Molly and Neil awake one night to find a luminescent rain falling upon the California landscape.  It is a rain that is falling the world over...and it preceds changes.  Changes that just aren't RIGHT.  Changes like...oh, say, walking dead, hideous creatures lurking in the trees, and LOTS of T.S. Elliot quotes.  But the night is only going to get longer, as the couple finds that there is a purpose to the madness, a quest they must undertake in their sleepy mountain town.  And if they fail, it may mean more than their lives...it may mean the end of the world...<br /><br />\\"The Taking\\" is not an easy book to review.  I've heard it slandered; I've heard it praised.  Dean Koontz, we can all agree, is an incredible writer; he can weave characters and plots that few authors would dare tackle.  That said, Molly and Neil are somewhat two-dimensional...at least compared to other characters Koontz has created in the past.  And the ending is unexpected and somewhat out of place.  And Koontz's blind insistence that dogs are by nature angelic is starting to grate on my nerves (and this is coming from a dog lover).<br /><br />But note the four stars.  Why four stars for a novel with so many flaws?  Simple--because, as many flaws as there may be, there is a point of quality.  The quick pace; the daring subject matter; the disturbing images presented throughout (don't read the first fifty pages during a nighttime rainstorm, trust me on this one); just the fact that he would write something so...final.  \\"The Taking\\" is not the best novel ever written, nor was it meant to be; instead, it is a daring look at the end of the world...and its rebirth, via one of modern-day fiction's greatest authors.e Taking\\" is not the best novel ever written, nor was it meant to be; instead, it is a daring look at the end of the world...and its rebirth, via one of modern-day fiction's greatest authors.	2005-05-22

He takes the adventure of a Clive Cussler novel, and balances it out with credible writing skills.  Naturally, this is not a flawless work; novels like this rarely are.  Some of the dialogue is stiff, while some of the major characters lack genuine...well, CHARACTER.  However, for an adventure novel, this--and all of James Rollins's books--is pretty darn good.  You don't pick up a James Rollins book wanting a literary masterpiece; and thank God, you don't get one.  What do you get?  An old-school adventure novel (albeit less sexist), with genuine suspense, action, and thrills.  In other words, James Rollins isn't reinventing the action thriller...he's just harking back to the days when action thrillers were GOOD.

Along with Lincoln Child, he's crafted some of the best thriller novels ever; \\"The Codex\\" pales when compared to his Preston/Child collaborations, but still manages to stand on its own as a fine example of the adventure genre.<br /><br />It goes something like this: billionaire (and tomb robber) Maxwell Broadbent realizes that his three songs have taken the easy road through life.  Therefore, when ol' Maxwell is diagnosed with cancer, he decides to put his kids to the test: if they want their inheritance, they have to find it--for Maxwell has hidden himself and his entire fortune in a tomb in the Hondurian jungle.<br /><br />The Broadbent kids aren't the only ones looking for the treasure, however.  A pharmacutical company has paid a sadistic private investigator to retrieve a Mayan codex from the Broadbent treasure--this codex containing keys that will lead to medical breakthroughs.<br /><br />Thus the hunt begins, and I guarantee that you will be on the edge of your seat for the entire ride.  It's not entirely original, no (this is an area most recently excavated by James Rollins) but it IS entertaining, and much better than most adventure novels.

Could be because a lot of them weren't published while the author was alive...there could've been a REASON he decided not to publish them.  But throughout, they have borne Laymon's patented, edge-of-your-seat suspense.  \\"Resurrection Dreams\\" has that suspense, and a lot more, making it one of the best Laymon novels to be published recently.<br /><br />Melvin Dobbs was the outcast at his high school.  Always the butt of the jokes, always picked on by pretty much everybody.  Vicki never picked on him (not that she liked him more than everybody else) and in fact once stood up for him.  Shouldn't have done that.  Because, all these years later, Melvin is still infatuated with her.  And she's returned home, to take up a job at the local doctor's office.  And Melvin is still around, and still up to his old tricks...<br /><br />At a high school science fair, Melvin tried to bring a girl back from the dead.  It didn't work.  In fact, it got him put in an institution.  Well, Melvin DID learn from his mistakes--learned how to ACTUALLY bring people back from the dead.  He's murdered several people in the process, and with his heart set on winning over Vicki, there ain't much this guy won't do.  Aren't too many people he won't kill, or too many natural laws he won't try to break...<br /><br />\\"Resurrection Dreams\\" has some gut-churning moments, as most of Laymon's books do.  However, it doesn't have the overt sexual overtones that many of his others (especially the recent publications) do--which means it has more room for plot and character.  While not his best, \\"Resurrection Dreams\\" shows that Richard Laymon was one of the best contemporary horror authors around.

And John Taylor.<br /><br />John has taken on some rough assignments in the past.  Hell, he's battled angels and demons--actual angels and demons.  He's seen hell is all its glories.  But never has John taken on a case like this.  He is up against his deadliest and closest enemy--himself.  For John has been hired to find the origins of the Nightside, and his quest is a personal vendetta--to find out just who (or what) his missing mother was, and determine if he really is the bringer of destruction, as many seem to think he is.  Can John Taylor,  a man with a gift and an unbearable curse, really bring about the destruction of the Nightside?  And just who is willing to stop him--by any means necessary?<br /><br />\\"Hex and the City\\" is easily the most gripping Nightside adventure yet, because it helps to wrap up many unanswered questions--while creating even more.  Simon R. Green has found a superlative narrator in John Taylor, a sympathetic hero up against insurmountable odds.  This is a book you will not be able to put down, I guarantee it.	2005-02-21

Green's \\"Nightside\\" series is unique is like saying that \\"Star Wars\\" was a series of movies that defined a genre--stating the obvious.  John Taylor is like no other literary hero--he is a man who is not quite human, who is bluff and bluster and smart enough to use it to his advantage.  He is cocky, he is funny, he is vulnerable...and he is the greatest product of the Nightside...a place where it's always 3 a.m., and your soul is always in peril...<br /><br />This time, John has to uncover the mystery of Ross, a singer who has an incredible voice--so incredible, in fact, that it drives many of her fans to kill themselves.  But Ross is innocent, caught up in a web of intrigue that may ultimately destroy her...and the Nightside.  As John throws himself into yet another dangerous case, in an attempt to bring down Ross's otherworldly managers, he pits himself against demons, man-eating-cars, and a man so powerful that maybe not even the great John Taylor can stop him...<br /><br />\\"Nightingale's Lament\\" is just as funny, just as edgy, and just as enoyable as its two predecessors.  You don't have to have read the other two books to understand this one (but I DO reccommend you read them, just 'cause they're that good), but why wouldn't you WANT to read them in the first place?  The \\"Nightside\\" series is truly enjoyable and unforgettable--with an ecclectic cast of characters, and a narrator who is the epitomy of every great literary hero.  \\"Nightingale's Lament\\" is just more proof that Simon R. Green has stumbled upon a gold mine...and loves writing these books as much as we enjoy reading them.	2005-02-20

Mandelbaum's translation is brisk and entertaining--he keeps the translation simple, making this book perfect for students and teachers alike.  The great translation helps keep readers in suspense and enthralled.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed by the essays, though.  I am not an academic--if you are, then good for you.  I'm sure you'll make more sense out of Mandelbaum's writing than I did.  Me, I'm a student, and I'm looking at this through a student's perspective.  The essays were unreadable.  Putting it in layman's terms would've been made this book a great asset to have--not only would we have the translated tale, but we'd also have some information on Dante himself, and a couple dissections of his work.  Instead, we have the translation, and three other pieces of writing that we can't decipher.<br /><br />That makes this edition of Dante's \\"Inferno\\" a hit-and-miss.  If you're in it for the entertainment factor, or want to do your own analysis of his work, then this is for you.  If you want to read what Mandelbaum thought about it...then, unless you have the patience and vocabulary of a Foreign Literature professor, you're out of luck.	2005-02-17

Victor Frankenstein and his creation did not die--they are still alive, and in New Orleans.  Driven by power, Victor has created a race--a New Race--of \\"men\\" who follow only his orders, who are programmed only to obey him...but like all master plans, this one has a few glitches.  Like, what happens when a superhuman suddenly gets a mind of its own?<br /><br />Deucalion was Victor's first creation.  He has spent two hundred years in hiding...and has just found out his creator's plans.  Traveling to New Orleans, Deucalion hooks up with two cops: Carson O'Connor, a street-wise cop as beautiful as she is deadly, and Michael Maddison, sarcastic but dangerous.  Their goal: to stop a demented serial killer...and make sure they put a hault to Victor Helios's plans before it's too late.  If the deadline hasn't already passed, that is...<br /><br />\\"Prodigal Son\\" is gripping and unforgettable.  I thought I would hate it; my all-time favorite author, Dean Koontz, reworking an old legend into a new story--it sounded like a recipe for disaster.  I almost didn't buy the book.  I'm glad I did.  This novel is chock-full of humor, suspense, terror, quantum physics, horror, romance, suspense...everything you expect from a good Koontz book (this one also reminded me of Koontz's older work...you know, the buddy-cop novels with a twist).<br /><br />Dean Koontz and Keven J. Anderson's \\"Prodigal Son\\" is a great beginning to what may become a legendary series.  Don't miss this book, not if you're a fan of great horror/suspense.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.	2005-02-04

Personally, I think what you don't see is scarier than what you do see--and, evidently, so does Dan Simmons.  Because \\"A Winter Haunting\\" is one of the scariest books I have ever read...and reaches an over-the-top level only at the climax of the book, which is the best place for it.<br /><br />Dale is returning to Elm Haven, where in the summer of 1960, he and his friends encountered a strange horror.  The memory of this summer has been blocked from Dale's head.  Dale's about to experience it all over again, however.  He is a credited proffessor, and an author of mediocre novels--until he leaves his wife for one of his students, who in turn leaves him for someone her own age.  After a failed suicide attempt--itself shrouded in mystery--Dale heads out to Illinois, to the village of his childhood, to his old friend Duane's house.  Duane died, that awful summer--but he did not leave.  He is still here...and so is something else.<br /><br />As winter sets in, and a terrible snowstorm makes its way towards Elm Haven, Dale will enounter figures from his past, both dead and alive--the old bully, now a sheriff; the sixth-grade sex bomb, now a failed actress; someone typing mysterious messages on his laptop, in Old English; an a pack of black hounds, that seem larger and more menacing each time Dale encounters this.  This is going to be very long winter for Dale Stewart...or a murderously short one.<br /><br />\\"A Winter Haunting\\" is one of the best examples of horror fiction I have come across in a long time, and I am a fan of the genre.  Dan Simmons is a brilliant author, and has shown his talents repeatedly.  This book is supposedly a sequal; I did not know that until half-way through it (when I found out via reviews on this website), and I have never read \\"Summer of Night\\", though I intend to.  This book stands on its own as a great example of how three-hundred-plus pages can be terrifying as hell.as hell.	2005-01-23

Bobbi Anderson stumbles across something in the woods behind her house one day: a piece of metal sticking up out of the ground.  Slowly, obsession sets in, as she finds herself digging and digging to discover what is underneath the earth...never noticing the effects the object has on her until it's too late.<br /><br />The object is a spaceship.  And it is gaining control of the town of Haven, Maine, turning once-ordinary people into scheming inventors, curious psycopaths...and worse.  Only Bobbi's friend, Jim Gardner--who has a few demons of his own to face--can stand up to the ordeal...if he has the courage, that is.  And if it isn't already too late.<br /><br />\\"The Tommyknockers\\" is a book about the discovery of an alien ship.  At its best, though, it is a character study of a small town; the village of Haven is represented much as the town of Castle Rock in a few of King's other novels.  Haven itself is a central character, as realistic as any of its inhabitants.<br /><br />But don't let that fool you--this is still a great horror novel by one of the genre's masters.  Stephen King never fails to prove his literary merits; \\"The Tommyknockers\\" is a prime example of his powers to give you nightmares.	2005-01-06

Little did Rule know that Ted would soon become the most wanted serial killer in the nation...<br /><br />This is a detailed, disturbing book about one of America's most heinous serial killers ever.  Rule does not flinch at describing her friend Ted's antics...and yet, she shows genuine sympathy for the man (rather, the side of the man she knew), and confesses her doubts and personal foils as she tried to solve these crimes, never knowing that one of her good friends was the killer.  \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is a great crime story--because it's unbelieavably true.	2004-12-30

There's the author who finds himself living for one purpose: to write the novel he know will make the critics love him.  There's the sculpter, who's a bit suspicious of things, but finds himself carving a life-size statue of Korban.<br /><br />This October is not normal, however.  For this year, Anna Galloway has arrived.  With deep and terrifying ties to the manor's past, Anna must face herself, her fears, and her destiny--and must chose between certain death, and unimaginable evil.<br /><br />Scott Nicholson's novel \\"The Manor\\" is engaging and unique.  With realistic characters and a penchant for the macabre, it certainly stands out in today's rather bland horror realm.  This novel will certainly keep you up late at night, turning the pages to see what other horrors await you.  A great, enjoyable read.	2004-12-20

Then there was the homicidal clown.<br /><br />Jimmy was raised to expect horror, but nothing could ever have prepared him for the twists his life would take.  The night of his birth is bad enough...but Jimmy has five more days of terror and revelation awaiting him...<br /><br />Dean Koontz has guts that few authors nowadays have.  He blends humor, love, hope, and faith into suspense/horror/thrillers and creates masterpieces.  \\"Life Expectancy\\" is no exception.  While arguably not Koontz's best, it's certainly better than a lot of other books out there.  It's touching, its suspenseful, it's purely enjoyable.  Everything a great novel should be.	2004-12-12

A year ago, Emmy and Lottie, two tough little sisters, did the impossible--they defeated Bob Claus, Santa's evil twin brother, in his dastardly scheme to take over Christmas.  This year, they're understandably expecting some peace and quiet (although their new puppy, who started life as a cow, is still on the lookout).<br /><br />Bob Claus has seen the error of his ways; but let's face it, he's still an idiot.  In an effort to lighten Santa's load, he constructs Super Santa One--a robot Santa Claus that has a few screws loose.  Along with a gorilla named Keith and a herd of robotic raindeer, Super Santa One has a new goal in mind...eat ceramics.<br /><br />Ok, so not quite.  And \\"Robot Santa\\" has quite a few flaws.  There are the frequent changes in rhyme scheme, the pointless division of the storyline, and the occasionally forced rhymes.  But there's also heart--heart and wit that borders on wisdom.  Koontz is not at his best at prose, that much is obvious, but he's not too bad at it.  And with Phil Parks doing some superb illustrations once more, \\"Robot Santa\\" is a sequal that, though it doesn't live up to it's predecessor, will be a delight to read for the holidays.	2004-11-21

But his best fiction remains, arguably, his short fiction.  His love for the short story is obvious--he has thrown together several collections, each one about as thick as one of his novels.<br /><br />The stories in \\"Skeleton Crew\\" are horrifying and touching.

In \\"The Wedding Gig,\\" a jazz band plays for the Mafia...and makes some unusual acquaintances.  \\"Survivor Type\\" details how far a man is willing to go in order to survive, while the poem \\"Paranoia: A Chant\\" is both amusing and disturbing.  \\"The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet\\" dives into a writer's psyche, and ponders just where all those stories come from.  The power of God is imprisoned in a typewriter in \\"Word Processor of the Gods\\" and a toy monkey in \\"The Monkey.\\"  \\"The Jaunt\\" is a horrifying tale of science fiction, while a woman finds the ultimate shortcut--through Hell--in \\"Mrs. Todd's Shortcut.\\"<br /><br />Some of the stories in here are fun and entertaining, such as \\"The Mist\\" and \\"The Wedding Gig.\\"  Others, such as \\"Cain Rose Up\\" and \\"Gramma\\", are downright disturbing.

Yes, I have, but that doesn't matter here.  Peter Benchley is a pretty good author, and the subject for this book is spine-tingling and horrific; however, the storyline doesn't echo the subject or the plot.  The characters are two-dimensional, there is an affair that is entirely unnecessary (probably added in to make the book longer), and--oh, I hate to say it!--without the movie, this book would've been shoved to the back of dusty library shelves decades ago.<br /><br />That sounds harsh.  Maybe it is.  I don't enjoy comparing books to their movie companions, so I won't do a full-fledged comparison here (they're pretty different, actually).  If you are still interested in reading the novel, I will offer up a summary of the plot:<br /><br />Police Chief Brody has discovered a body on the local beach of his town.  A body attacked and ravaged by what appears to be a shark of immense proportions.  This is only the first body, however; more will appear, as vacationers move in--despite Brody's warnings--and the shark commences to satisfy its ravenous appetite, again and again and again...<br /><br />The writing is pretty bland (honestly, I think that was done on purpose).  The story itself moves along rather briskly, but is full of holes.  The shark is entirely menacing, and you do find yourself rooting for the good guys.  On that level, \\"Jaws\\" succeeds.  But on the other hand, you pray the shark will just gobble up all those stupid villagers...oh, well.  Maybe in a sequal.	2004-09-15

There is another man, who appears to have blue skin, and who knows when children are in danger.  He has arrived from the future, intent on saving the children of Portland, Oregon...including his own child...<br /><br />The plot is a bit ludicrous, but so were those of David's previous novels.  What \\"Cradle\\" lacks is reality; while occasionally suspenseful, and at times frightening, the novel's characters rarely exceed their two-dimensional forms, and the plot is pretty predictable, not to mention cliche.  Though for some it may be a brisk, even entertaining read, fans of David's previous works will find it lacking in quality.  Every author writes a book of lesser quality at some point in their career; James F. David has done it with this one.

After all, as stated in the introduction by editors Elizabeth and Thomas Monteleone, when the last \\"Borderlands\\" collection was published I was getting my kicks by reading \\"Goosebumps.\\"  That being said, I AM able to judge this collection: and I say it's one hell of a read!<br /><br />The great thing about this collection is its uniqueness and diversity.  Gone are the vampire/werewolf/ghost stories; in place are tales, some supernatural, some horror (and a couple that aren't), about the tricks the human mind can play.  Some of these tricks stay within the mind itself; some of them manifest in the physical world, in the way we interpret our surroundings.  These stories are psychological horror stories; in my opinion, the best kind.<br /><br />Diversity.  There are some big name people in here: Stephen King takes a horrific look at exercise in his novella \\"Stationary Bike;\\" in \\"Father Bob and Bobby,\\" Whitley Strieber tells of a priest who is having a horrific controntation with his reality.  You'll never read a bedtime story again after looking through John Farris's \\"Story Time with the Bluefield Stranger.\\"  David J. Schow's \\"The Thing too Hideous to Describe\\" is a comedic, yet tragic, look at the life of our world's hidden monsters.  Bentley Little's \\"The Planting\\" is just as macabre, outrageous, and hideously enjoyable as the author's novels; while Tom Piccirilli's \\"Around it Still the Sumac Grows\\" details a man returning to his old high school, and reliving the horrors he once experienced.<br /><br />There are some new names, however.  Lon Prater's \\"Head Music,\\" a poetic story about a man who becomes kin with a strange sea creature, is the author's first professional sale.  Adam Fusco's story is a terrifying glimpse into the future of scientific research, while John Mertz's \\"Prisoner 392\\" is a great mixture of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" and \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\"  A man faces the alternative realities he's created for himself in Bill Gauthier's tale; Bev Vincent weaves a tale of irony and tragedy; a man confronts his past and his daughter in John McIlveen's \\"Infliction\\"; and a woman has the perfect family--three real beautiful daughters, and her favorite, the imaginary one--in L.

He has a past--and until now, it's been a mystery.  But someone is dragging Cole through his own dirt, and revealing the skeletons in his closet.<br /><br />Cole's girlfriend's son, Ben, has just been kidnapped.  Whoever did it is a professional...he is used to stalking humans, and is NOT one for failure.  Cole, along with his silent-but-deadly partner/friend Joe Pike, is about to enter a world where no one can be trusted, where danger lurks around every corner...and where hope may only be an illusion.<br /><br />Robert Crais is a great writer.  Though he has written other novels with different characters (Carol Starkey, who appeared in his novel DEMOLITION ANGEL, plays a role here), his best have always been his Elvis Cole mysteries.  An engaging and multi-leveled character, Elvis Cole is often overlooked in today's reading world...but shouldn't be.  And neither should Crais.  THE LAST DETECTIVE is a great, thrilling read by a great, engaging author.	2004-09-02

Underneath the Pentagon, a creature has been awakened.  Bloodthirsty, intelligent, with an agenda all its own, it begins to kill...and kill...and kil...<br /><br />Teamed together to stop it are Ed Jeffers, who \\"runs\\" the Pentagon; Dr. Andrea Deluca, a herpetologist who may know more than she's letting on; and Terrill \\"Terror\\" Hodge, a SEAL who is uniquely fearless, and thrives on danger.  Together, they must stop this creature before it is too late...<br /><br />Alright.  An interesting, but not exactly unique, plot.  A creature that is again interesting but entirely scary.  Characters that are (yes) interesting, even realistic, but not ones who're likely to become your best friends for a couple days.  \\"Sleeper\\" seems destined to be a forgetful horror/thriller novel...which is unfortunate.  Steve Harriman obviously has talent, as this novel moves along at a reasonable pace (save for the flashback scenes).  My only real beef with Harriman is his frequent rants about al-Quaida, and how horrible and terrible they are; not that I disagree--I happen to believe he has a valid point--but a fiction novel isn't the place for such thoughts, which seem to come out of nowhere.<br /><br />Still, \\"Sleeper\\" is definitely a novel you'll want to read, if you were a fan of \\"The X-Files,\\" or just enjoy a good horror/thriller.  Not entirely unique, and not the best book ever written...but good enough.  Yes, definitely good enough to warrent re-reading.	2004-08-28

Paul Wilson has a knack for writing thrillers (the \\"Repairman Jack\\" series, for example); in \\"The Keep,\\" he just combines it with some extra-large doses of horror.<br /><br />In the Romanian mountains, a bunch of Nazis have stumbled upon a deserted structure.  Called a \\"keep\\"--though that's not what it really is--its purpose is a mystery, as are the strange crosses placed at precise intervals on all the walls.  There's also the fact that no birds have nested at the keep, and no one is permitted to stay inside overnight...<br /><br />But those darn Nazis always were foolhardy.  Something is released that first night, something that defies description.  It moves stealthily through the shadows, it murders with explicit savagery...and its bloodlust is endless...<br /><br />Only one mysterious man and one determined Jewish woman can stop this evil...if the time has not already run out...<br /><br />Evil vs. evil.  F. Paul Wilson's \\"The Keep\\" is the first novel in what became known as the \\"Adversary Cycle,\\" a series of loosely based novels all tied together at the end.  \\"The Keep\\" stands alone, however, as an exemplary example of how a horror novel should be written.  Delictable, terrifying, and unforgettable!	2004-08-25

It's short, it's written lightly, and could easily be read in a day's time, if you had the opportunity to sit down.  For that reason, it is easy to dismiss this book as just another light-hearted fiction novel.  That would be a grand mistake.<br /><br />\\"The Stepford Wives\\" is not just any other suspense novel.  In point of fact, it's not even suspenseful anymore, what with the popular remake of the film.  What makes this novel stand out--actually, what makes MOST of Ira Levin's novels stand out--is the subtle satirical horror of it all:<br /><br />Joanna Eberhart and her husband Walter move into a new town.  Stepford.  It has a great reputation, with great schools, a wonderful library, and happy husbands.  VERY happby husbands.  Because after 4 months, the wives of Stepford change.  They go from normal, sometimes even feminist, women, into obediant and submissive housewives.  And Joanna's time is rapidly coming...<br /><br />See?  It's a suspense novel.  It's a science fiction novel.  Quite possibly, it's a HORROR novel (ROSEMARY'S BABY, anyone?).  Ira Levin is a talented, brilliant author.  He combines the fears of ordinary life into a satirical masterpiece that will leave you as disturbed as you are entertained.  Brilliant writing.	2004-08-20

Handsome, intelligent, cunning, seductive, he is everything James Bond could ever hope to be...except Gallatin is a werewolf.<br /><br />Caught up in the troubles of WWII, desperately trying to uncover and stop a top-secret Nazi experiment, Gallatin meets a wide array of interesting and quirky characters, some of them friendly, some of them deadly.  He must also come to grips with what he is, and face his own inner enemies...before time runs out.<br /><br />Okay, so a werewolf solider in WWII doesn't sound like a great idea for a book; or, at least, not a good book.  But Robert McCammon pulls it off--he has written a top-notch, gripping, emotional thriller that defies logic and critics' expectations.  Indeed, it has such emotional power--especially in the flashback sequences of Gallatin's troubled childhood--that it even wrenched a few tears from me...and that's not an easy thing to do.<br /><br />\\"The Wolf's Hour\\" is certainly one of my top-five favorite books of all time (and I've read a lot, people!).  Robert McCammon has written some doozies in his time, but this one surpasses all of them.  Gripping, thrilling, intoxicating...everything a good suspense novel should be.  You want a war story?  Romance?  Horror novel?  Action-adventure?  This is it.	2004-08-18

I'm willing to bet that you don't know too much about the Bible.  It's the best-selling book of all time, and millions of people every day base their lives around it.  But very few know what's in it, or what it means.  Kenneth C. Davis has taken the Bible--using several different versions and translations--and broken it down to the bare necessities: everything that's in there that's important, and some stuff you probably didn't know.<br /><br />For example: in the first Commandment, God never says he is the ONLY god; Charlton Heston may have led the Israelites across the Red Sea, but Moses went elsewhere; if you have worn a garment of two different materials, you have disobeyed God's law; the Book of Revelation was most likely written about the Romans, and not Satan.  These are just a few facts you'll find within this book that you may not have known.<br /><br />The real reason to read this book is that Davis tells the Bible's story, relating it to issues in real life.  Where a character's existence is sketchy, he comes out and says so--he talks of the Bible as objectively as is possible.<br /><br />In this day and age of \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" it's important that people understand the source of so much daily news.  \\"Don't Know Much about the Bible,\\" by Kenneth C. Davis, tells how the Bible came to be written, by different authors over different centuries, and what the story really says.  It is, after all, The Greatest Story Ever Told.  Whether you're taking classes, seeking the Truth, or just wondering what the heck the Good Book says, this is one you've got to read.	2004-08-16

Together, the original band that fought It must return to Derry, discarding the lives they have made in their absence.  However, It is more powerful than they ever imagined It could...<br /><br />Stephen King has struck gold repeatedly in his career.  He's struck silver a few times; never anything less than bronze.  I don't know if \\"It\\" qualifies as gold or not; you'd have to ask the judges.  However, all that I can tell you is that \\"It\\" is a good novel.  A long one, to be true, but it--\\"It\\"--doesn't read that way.  It's Stephen King at his gripping, horrific, terrifying best.  And that's pretty darn good.	2004-08-13

Of course, his parents don't believe him; monsters don't exist.  But not all monsters are supernatural in nature...<br /><br />Sometimes, a monster is a virus.  A virus that infects a loveable St. Bernard named Cujo.  A virus that makes poor Cujo insane, steering him down a path of bloodlust that forces him to trap two unsuspecting people in an automobile in the middle of summer, with no help around for miles...<br /><br />\\"Cujo\\" is a classic horror novel.  Whether or not it involves elements of the supernatural (personally, I think it's up for grabs), it is a rivetting novel and among Stephen King's personal best.  It is one that will get you terrified of St. Bernards, because the story is all-to-real, and could happen even to you...	2004-08-12

Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child score yet again--a rivetting, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride in their usual well-thought-out, thrilling style.<br /><br />Jeremy Grove, a notorious art critic, has been found dead.  Murdered.  Charred.  Burned from the inside out, with a demonic hoof print burned into the floor, and his crucifix melted.  The work of the devil?  Or an even greater evil?<br /><br />Special Agent Pendergast (RELIC, RELIQUARY, THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES, and STILL LIFE WITH CORWS) has taken up the case.  A famous (some would say infamous) agent of the FBI, Pendergast's methods and manners are eccentric, dignified, mysterious...and almost always successful.  His interest in unique cases has often placed his life in peril, but never has he had a case such as this, where he just may be up against the Devil Himself.<br /><br />Also featuring former NYPD lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta (RELIC, RELIQUARY) and now-Captian Laura Hayward (RELIQUARY), and a ton of references to former Preston/Child novels, this is a suspense thriller that will intimidate and enthrall new fans, and delight old ones.  You needn't have read any other of Pendergast's adventires (or other Preston/Child novels), although I suggest you do so, because they are all entertaining.  Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child write great works on their own, but when they combine their talents they give us this: a thrilling, gripping, engrossing, delectible suspense novel that combines science/technology, police procedural, and good ol' fashion suspense into a book you won't soon forget.  BRIMSTONE is a must-read for thriller fans.	2004-08-09

They soon find out that Entragian is peculiar, and think he's insane. But he's not. In fact, he's not even Entragian...not anymore...<br /><br /> In Desperation, Nevada, something has happened. A new traveller has arrived at this former mining town, and taken control. Killed all the residents. And now, it needs more victims...<br /><br /> &quot;Desperation&quot; is a novel about good and evil, and the forms it takes. In this macabre novel, Stephen King is at his best--weaving together characters, using violence and gore, and piling up suspenseful pages upon suspenseful pages. This is a great noevl to read by itself; if you read it with its &quot;companion&quot; novel, &quot;The Regulators&quot;--written by Richard Bachman (wink, wink)--it becomes not only scary, but FUN.

With all the adventure of his previous four books, plus some amazing character development (even the evil Petkov is drawn as a human figure; I felt myself feeling sorry for the poor guy several times), \\"Ice Hunt\\" is a bonafide thrilling ride.

Something horrible, something terrible...something unexplainable.  And it is up to a small handful of people--and a faithful dog--to find out the answer, before it is too late...<br />Like in most Dean Koontz novels, plot is irrelevant.  Not that it isn't good; Koontz weaves together some of the most creative plots in modern fiction.  But the thing with a Koontz novel is this: character development.  He has a knack for bringing characters to life, so it's as though they are right there beside you, telling you their accounts.  Or it could just be me...<br />Suspense, too.  Koontz writes nothing without some element of suspense; in his novels (which almost always blend sci-fi and horror with commercial thriller fiction), suspense is given the go-ahead to run free and rampant, pushing you to the edge of your seat, but holding back just enough so you won't fall and hurt yourself.<br />These Berkley reprints are great; we get some of Koontz's best novels, with new afterwords (in this one, Koontz talks about this novel being his first number one hardback, and a crocodile named Chloe who eats literary critics).  The only problem is, die hard Koontz fans like myself are forced to spend another six-to-eith bucks for a book we already own...but oh well.<br />&quot;Midnight.&quot;  Dean Koontz.

Were you expecting it to be?  I doubt it.  Although, I must admit, Richard Laymon was capable of writing some strand-out novels (&quot;The Travelling Vampire Show&quot; and &quot;Island&quot; among them).  This is, never fear, a GOOD novel--especially a good horror novel.<br />Jody is sleeping over at her friend's house.  It's all well...until she shes her friend impaled on a spear.  And then all hell breaks loose.  Jody and her friend's little brother Andy manage to escape...but that's just the beginning.  First, there's the pursuit.  And there's the waiting.  Becuase the killers will catch up...and they'll want to have some fun...<br />Then there's Simon.  He's the guy who's been assigned to find Jody.  Which is perfectly alright with Simon, because he has an agenda of his own, which he relates to the readers as he narrates his sections of the book.  You see, Simon just may be sicker and crazier than his colleagues...and he'll stop at nothing to capture Jody.<br />There is one thing going for this novel that most other horror novels lack: suspense.  Richard Laymon wove suspense into everything he wrote.  Few can match him when it comes to edge-of-your-seat storytelling.  If for that reason alone, you should buy this book.<br />&quot;Endless Night&quot; is a bit gruesome, I'll admit.  It had my stomach churning in a couple of spots.  But it is a good, fast read.  A bit darker than Laymon's last published novels have been (although, as any fan can tell you, he can get pretty sadistic at times), and a bit more haphazzard, but &quot;Endless Night&quot; is still a novel for horror fans, or Laymon's new legions of fans (of which I am one).  It's a thrilling, gory ride...one that will have you at the edge of your seat the entire time.	2004-07-11

I recently dug this book out from beneath a lot of my childhood stuff.  My dad read it to me when I was just a little kid; at 18, I just reread it, and enjoyed it as much, if not more so--because now I could read between the lines.<br />Thirty chapters.  Each one is like a fable--an entertaining story, a nugget of truth woven into the fabric of each one.  Peer pressure, politeness, standing up for yourself...sometimes the lessons are direct, sometimes they are subtle.  Maybe kids won't understand them exactly, but they'll certainly remember the stories and remember the lessons thus.<br />The story:<br />There is something very wrong with Wayside School.  It was built sideways--instead of one story with 30 rooms, is has 30 stories and one room per story.  No nineteenth story, though, meaning that Miss Zarves, who teaches there, doesn't exist, either.<br />At Wayside, students have the tendency to get turned into apples; those pesky dead rats, who live in the basement, are always trying to get into class; sleeping through class is considered educational; turning the lights on and off is a task not just anyone can do; you can help yourself to ice cream with the flavor of your fellow students, but please refrain from biting your classmates; the lunch lady just can't ruin milk, no matter how hard she tries; mosquito bites are great for counting purposes; your two missing teeth are the best in the whole world, as are the hat you aren't wearing and the joke you didn't tell; only being able to read upside down ain't much of a problem, after all; where toes cost a nickel apiece, unless they're little runts; trading names consists of spinning around really fast until you don't know who's who; if two plus two doesn't equal four, watch out; and where you need a reason to be sad, but not to be happy.<br />\\"Sideways Stories From Wayside School\\" by Lous Sachar is a classic.  Buy it, for your kid, your sibling, your niece/nephew, or yourself.  It's entertaing for all ages, and just might help its reader become a better person.s, and just might help its reader become a better person.	2004-07-08

NIGHTMARES &amp; DREAMSCAPES is a collection of some odd, eclectic short fiction, showcasing Stephen King at his macabre best.<br />In &quot;Dolan's Cadillac,&quot; a man gets revenge for his murdered wife...through hard labor and ingenious thinking.  &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; is a tale for every child who had an insufferable teacher, and wanted to do something about it.&quot;The Night Flier&quot; is a tale of obsession that leads to the ultimate horror.  In &quot;Popsy,&quot; a young boy is kidnapped...but his grandfather is on his trail, and has a few surprises up his cape.  &quot;The Moving Finger&quot; is a macabre tale of madness...or the utmost sanity.  In &quot;You Know They Got a Hell of a Band,&quot; a young couple is about to attend an amazing rock concert...which may last for the rest of eternity.  &quot;The Ten O'Clock People&quot; tells of two societies who live beneath normal human radar; one is benevolent, while the other is bent on world domination.  &quot;Crouch End&quot; and &quot;The Doctor's Case&quot; are great examples of British fiction by an American, the latter about Sherlock Holmes.  In the fantisful &quot;The House on Maple Street,&quot; four children are about to unlock the secrets of their home.  &quot;Umney's Last Case&quot; is a bizarre crime-noir, about the power an author has over his story, and vice versa.  &quot;Head Down&quot; is an enchanting essay about kids and baseball.<br />NIGHTMARES &amp; DREAMSCAPES.  Stephen King.  Need I say any more than that?  A wonderful, intriquing, and entertaining collection, this book is guaranteed to occupy a welcomed place on your bookshelf.

Jack McGarvey, one of L.A.'s finest, is wounded in a violent and spectacular gunfight.  In Montana, Eduardo Fernandez encounters something in the woods...something which means him harm.<br />When Eduardo dies, and McGarvey inherits the man's cabin, it seems like a dream: a chance to get away from the city and really LIVE.  But living may turn to dying, and the McGarvey family is about to find out.  There is still something in the woods, and it wasn't satisfied with Eduardo.  It want's McGarvey's young son...and is ready to do anything to get him...<br />This isn't Koontz's best, but as a sci-fi thriller, it's pretty darn good.  A &quot;creature feature&quot;, yes, but it's more than that, as any Koontz novel is: it's a novel of a man defending his family against an unknown evil, and coming to grips with himself.  A reworked version of an earlier Koontz story, this novel is, like most of Koontz's work, a nearly-flawless thrill ride of chills and suspense.  Dean Koontz is a masterful writer; &quot;Winter Moon&quot; is an incredible novel.  Get the picture?	2004-06-28

Then he came home to a country that shunned sniping, and he went into seclusion in the Arkansas mountains.<br />Now he's been called out.  A shady government conspiracy wants to use him in an assassination--as the fallguy.  And when Swagger does indeed fall for it, lured into a trap, he promises his tormentors will pay...with their blood...<br />Helping him is FBI agent Nick Memphis, who's just recieved his third strike.  An odd pair, but together, they must unravel a far-reaching conspiracy...and bring vengence upon those who deserve it.<br />&quot;Point of Impact&quot; was the first Stephen Hunter novel I read.  It got me hooked on his writing, though few other novels lived up to it (&quot;Dirty White Boys&quot; was pretty good, if I recall correctly).  This novel is a thriller of the highest caliber (no pun intended).  It's about a proud Southern gunman pushed to the limits...the one spot where you DON'T want him to be!  This is a terrific, suspenseful book, and if you are a fan of thrillers and haven't read it yet, then you absolutely must.	2004-06-26

I'm sure it was on your list for a long time, and just got pushed aside for other, newer books.  We forgive you.<br />Stephen King's '75 novel, \\"Salem's Lot,\\" is probably the greatest vampire novel since Stoker's \\"Dracula\\".  But is that really a correct statement?  Anyone who's read Stoker's novel can tell you that is not suspenseful at all, has shallow characters, and is incredibly anti-climactic.<br />On the other hand, King's novel is built around a suspenseful plot, involves three-dimensional characters, and has several climaxes (somewhere, there's a pervert thinking dirty thoughts).  Not to belittle Stoker's work--he practically invented the vampire genre, more or less--but I would have to say that \\"Salem's Lot\\" is probably the best vampire novel I've ever read.  Maybe of all time.<br />That said...Ben Mears is returning to 'Salem's Lot, the town where he was raised, to try and dispell his sudden writer's block.  He meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman, Susan.  He is, if not happy, at least the most content he's been in quite a while.<br />But the town is in for a surprise.  The Marsten House, the Lot's local haunted house, has been rented out.  A couple of new characters are in town.  A dog is found hanging on the cemetary gate.<br />All hell is about to break loose in 'Salem's Lot.  There's little chance anyone will make it out alive--though the odds are good that they'll make it out UNDEAD.<br />Stephen King is a writer of writers.  He has grabbed horror by the balls, and won't ever let it go.  \\"Salem's Lot\\" shows us what a horror author can do.  This novel defined every other horror novel that came after it.  Read it, marvel at it...but most of all, enjoy it.<br />And I'd suggest leaving the lights on if you're alone in the house at night.  Just a warning.	2004-06-24

You'd expect thrillers of this caliber from more well-established authors, such as Stephen Hunter or Nelson DeMille.  However, Steve Thayer--who I'd never heard of until I picked up this book--unleashes upon the world a thriller as good as they get!<br />Kickapoo Falls, Wisconsin, located in the beautiful Dells region.  The year is 1960, a tumultuous year that revolved around two men: John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.<br />In Kickapoo Falls, however, something else has come up.  Two bodies, naked, gruesomely murdered, found in a crop circle in the middle of a wheat field.  No witnesses--at least none who aren't implicated.  Deputy Pliny Pennington identifies one of the bodies as Maggie Butler--a former childhood friend, and the girl he'd been lusting after for most of his life.<br />It's no secret that Pennington wanted Maggie, and she wouldn't have him.  In fact, now the town's beginning to think Pennington had something to do with it--except, of course, for the people who know the truth.  For Maggie's death is just a small part in a conspiracy reaching further than Pennington could have ever dreamed.  Now, using the skills gained by a stint as a military sniper and former deer hunter, Pennington is about to face the ultimate test of survival, as he races against enemies, shady characters in suits, former friends--and himself.<br />Steve Thayer's writing is brisk and clear.  He sidesteps from the plot every now in then, but only to give you a better insight into who Pliny Pennington really is--and make you wonder if you can trust his narration.  \\"The Wheat Field\\" is a novel of sex, violence, and the quest for the truth--no matter how much it may hurt.	2004-06-20

There's no escaping reality, as one boy, Cory Mackenson, is about to find out.<br />It begins when Cory and his father witness a car disappearing into a lake rumored to be bottomless.  Cory's father dives in, and before the car goes completely under, he witnesses something terrifying: a man, handcuffed to the wheel, with copper wire around his throat.  Murdered.<br />But summer is coming.  A summer filled with wonder, mystery, magic, and tragedy.  It is a summer where Cody will realize that magic can really happen; where he will witnesses a creature that should've been extinct millions of years ago; where he will discover the power and love of family, and the unbreakable bond of friendship; where he will know terror as no one ever has.<br />Robert R. McCammon's writing is not always consistent.  Some of his novels, such as &quot;Mystery Walk,&quot; have been almost unreadable; others, such as &quot;Stinger&quot; and &quot;Swan Song,&quot; have been enjoyable but forgettable; others, such as &quot;Wolf's Hour,&quot; have been masterpieces.  &quot;Boy's Life&quot; belongs in this latter category.<br />A comparison to Bradbury's &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; is unavoidable; however, McCammon manages to throw something into his tale that even Bradbury could not: suspense.  This is a suspense novel, set aound a young boy and his quest for the truth, no matter what the cost.<br />&quot;Boy's Life&quot; is completely enchanting and thoroughly unforgettable.  It is a novel for fans of any literay genre.  It is, plain and simple, a masterpiece.	2004-06-10

Koontz isn't a horror novelist, even though he's been cast in that role.  He's called the Master of SUSPENSE, and for a reason: his tales are downright suspenseful (the mold for other novelists) even if they usually don't use the element of horror.<br />But in this collection, Dean Koontz delivers several short stories that contemplate and expertly acheive horror genre greatness.<br />The title story (actually, it's a novel) is about a man who returns home...then is forced to face the demons of his past, who have come back to haunt him.  &quot;Kittens,&quot; Koontz's first published work of fiction, is about a little girl who decides to get revenge on her parents.<br />&quot;The Black Pumpkin,&quot; along similar lines, is about a little boy ostracized from his own family.  &quot;Miss Atilla the Hun,&quot; &quot;We Three,&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Storm&quot; are brilliant sci-fi pieces (from Koontz's old days of writing science fiction), while &quot;Trapped&quot; follows a similar vein as Koontz's pinnacle novel &quot;Watchers&quot;.<br />&quot;Bruno&quot; is a flat-out hilarious sci-fi farse, while &quot;Hardshell&quot; (the first piece of fiction I read by Koontz) is about a cop hunting down a killer who is a little different.  &quot;Snatcher&quot; is a journey into the macabre, while &quot;Twilight of the Dawn&quot; is a moving tale of a man's search for faith and guidance.<br />&quot;Strange Highways&quot; is not so strange at all; it's great fiction by a masterful writer.  Dean Koontz is without a doubt one of the best writers of all time.  That statement may sound a little exaggerated, if you haven't read any of his work.  If you read something by him, though, you'll know what I mean.  Why not start here, with &quot;Strange Highways&quot;?  It's diverse, and it shows you what this man can do--and do well.	2004-05-14

Okay, I can buy that.  Truly, he has a unique grasp on the horror genre; and he's been strenghtening that grasp for half a century.  Living legend?  It fits.<br />&quot;Dark Universe&quot; is a thrilling collection.  The stories in it aren't all unique (&quot;And Miles to Go...&quot; brings back memories of Bradbury's best, for example), but they're all good.  &quot;The Underdweller&quot; is a sci-fi tale of survival in an appopolyptic world.  &quot;Lonely Train's A'Comin&quot; tells of a brother's lust for revenge, and the macabre ride it takes him on.  &quot;The Cure&quot; is the journal of a man who lives a perfect life, except for the fact that he strangles people.  &quot;The Giant Man,&quot; aside from an extremely weird and entertaining story, is a metaphor for the restraining life of big cities.  &quot;Stoner&quot; is just plain weird, as is &quot;Heart's Blood.&quot;  &quot;Ceremony&quot; finds a hired killer in a small town, on Halloween, about to discover something that he really didn't want to know.  &quot;Boyfren,&quot; probably one of the strangest and most disturbing stories I've ever read, tells of how easily a young girl is led into a life of torture and cruelty...but doesn't know it.<br />Yep, William F.

And yes, there really are things worse than death...<br />Taylor is joined by an incredbile ensemble of charactors, including: Shotgun Suzie, a woman whom you really DON'T want to meet in a dark ally at night; Razor Eddie, Punk God of the Straight Razor; Belle, a deadly, genuine woman--more or less; the Fourth Reich, consisting of a couple dozen (...); the Demon Lordz, a clan of extremely minor demons; the Collector, who has a warehouse full of objects from the past and future; Merlin Satanspawn, the infamous wizard, long deceased; and many, many other.<br />This is, if I am correct, Simon R.

I won't say Brian Keene's novel &quot;The Rising&quot; is a perfect horror novel; it has its flaws, to be sure.  However, rivetting until the end, it is definitely one of the best horror novels (and possibly the best zombie novel) I have read in a long time.<br />The plot:<br />It's an accident, really.  A device designed to create black holes opens up a portal to another reality--Hell, if you will.  When we die, and our life forces depart our bodies, spirits from this other reality come back and inhabit them...intent on making corpses for more of their brethren to come through.<br />&quot;The Rising&quot; follows four primary people: Jim Thurmond, who's searching for his son; the Reverend Martin, who hears of Jim's plight and dedicates himself to helping the man; Baker, a scientist who had a lot to do with the catastrophe that has happened, and who now wishes to survive long enough to make ammends; and Frankie, a former prostitute running not only from the zombies, but from her drug addiction as well...<br />As their journeys intersect each other, these four individuals will have to face the bitter truth: though many people have survived the zombies so far, sometimes the walking dead aren't half as evil as the living...<br />&quot;The Rising&quot; by Brian Keene is spectacular.  Maybe it's ripping off &quot;Day of the Dead;&quot; personally, I don't care.  All I care about is that these zombies are like none you've seen before, and Keene is one hell of a writer.  Though he may not be the next Stephen King (he lacks King's commercial appeal), Keene is, like many authors published by Leisure Horror, a rare and dignified talent.<br />Buy &quot;The Rising,&quot; but on two conditions: 1, you have to be a true horror fan; and 2, you have to be willing to have your socks scared right off your feet!	2004-03-26

Because, you see, that sadist killer is really hard to kill.  After taking four bullets, he's still bloodthirsty.<br />First, he finishes off the woman.<br />Then, he goes after Neal, and everyone Neal loves.<br />A gripping suspense thriller in Laymon's usual sadisticly-edged style, &quot;Body Rides&quot; will keep you turning pages.  Aside from the unnecessary plot-twist near the end, this book is one of Laymon's best--and that's saying a lot.<br />&quot;Body Rides&quot; by Richard Laymon is a horrific treat.

It won't be the last.<br />AMERICAN GODS is about a man named Shadow.  He is a good man, who did his time for a small crime.  Getting out of prison, he learns that his wife has died.  Flying home for her funeral, he meets a man named Mr. Wendseday, who offers Shadow a job...and seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does...<br />Shadow finds himself in a world of myriad dangers and mysteries.  What seems to be one thing is in fact another; the danger comes from places he never even dreamed possible.  Is he going insane...or is the explanation for all this too great to comprehend?<br />This novel is, at times, a bit harder to understand.  However, with patience (a rudimentary knowledge of mythology won't hurt, either) everything comes together in the end, for a wham-bam conclusion that'll leave you reeling.<br />Neil Gaiman is obviously a talented author.  AMERICAN GODS is one of the best novels I've read in quite a while.  Give it a try.  Just be careful: you might not want to put it down.	2004-03-06

Or, rather, four seperate worlds, located in the remote Nevada desert.  High tech--Utopia runs on robotics, all controlled by the Metanet, developed by Dr. Andrew Warne.  Incidently, Warne's ex-lover, Sarah Boatwright, is running the park.<br />Utopia's a safe, fun place.  Everything is &quot;real&quot;--it's as if you've stepped out of the normal world, and into a side demension.  It's so nice, the security force doesn't even carry weapons.<br />Today, however, is different.  Because today, someone new has entered the park.  He calls himself John Doe: a suave, intelligent, sophisticated, ruthless man looking to earn himself a retirement fund from his day job--terrorism.  With Doe is a small team of professional terrorists and hackers.  Their goal: to take control of Utopia.<br />Doe is perfectly willing to negotiate transactions with Boatwright in secret, without the guests of Utopia knowing.  But if she dares to cross him...well, if that should happen, then Doe will turn this Heaven into Hell on Earth.<br />&quot;Utopia&quot; is a thrillride of thrillrides, a pulse-pounding race as Warne, Boatwright, a robotics technician, and a professional bodyguard who happens to get caught up in the action, pursue the menacing Doe through the park.  You will be on the edge of your seat the entire time, I kid you not.<br />Lincoln Child--coauthor of some great novels with Douglas Preston--successfully makes his solo debut with this novel.  If you're a fan of the Preston/Child novels (and you don't have to be to enjoy this book), then you know exactly the excitement you're going to get.<br />Lincoln Child's &quot;Utopia&quot; is a suspense novel to be reckoned with.  The park comes alive around you, and the characters develop their own heartbeats.  It's a novel of suspense, emotion, humor, thrills, and science, as a &quot;perfect&quot; world is turned upside down by one man's horrific greed.<br />This novel's gonna do to theme parks what &quot;Jaws&quot; did to the ocean.

I'll get right into the summary of the book, and spare you the boring commentary (for a little while):<br />Odd Thomas never fails to live up to his name.  He's a short-order cook in Pico Mundo, California, a town of about 40,000.  He lives above a garage.  He's twenty years old.  His parents are border-line insane.  He and his girlfriend, Stormy, have matching birthmarks.<br />Oh, yeah: Odd sees dead people.<br />Sometimes, he helps them.  Like the little girl who comes to him and tells him (without speaking, for the dead don't speak) that she was raped and murdered.  Then, sometimes, he has to go chasing the perpetrator through a swimming pool, into someone's home.  And that's just the first 20 pages.<br />Odd also sees other things.  Bodachs--shadowy spirits that seem to thrive on evil.  Demons?  Lost souls?  Who knows?  But Odd knows that they mean trouble--and when a man comes into the Pico Mundo Grill with a score of bodachs trailing him, Odd realizes that Pico Mundo is in for some trouble.<br />And he's the only one that can stop it.<br />A fast-paced, rock 'em 'til they drop suspense novel, Dean Koontz returns to what he's good at: scaring your behind off!  ODD THOMAS will leave you begging for more, chapter after chapter, as you read your way through the adventures of a young man just doing what he can to avert a disaster.<br />ODD THOMAS is a novel about an intriguing, all-too-real young man who faces gigantic problems.  Yeah, Odd's a freak--but he's still human.  With this novel, Koontz will make you think about your own humanity--while at the same time taking you to the edge of your seat, with gravity threatening to pull you out.<br />Better wear a seatbelt.	2003-12-19

Five girls, bound by daring acts of courage and stupidity, all caught on videotape.  Five girls, closer than sisters, who abandon everything once a year to get together and celebrate their friendship.<br />Five girls who are going to realize they've madea  mistake in coming to Totem Pole Lodge.  You see, once upon a time, the Totem Pole Lodge was a great resort--a beautiful, lively place.  Then there was an accident in the forest--a young girl died.  She was a local.  Her family was crazy.  ALL the locals were crazy.  And they attacked the Lodge.  28 people--men, women, and children--died.<br />And twelve years later, it still isn't a nice place to visit.<br />Especially at night, when you're unarmed, and unsuspecting.<br />Richard Laymon is a master storyteller.  He may not have the fame that he deserved--you won't find his name in lights alongside Stephen King--but that never seemed to deter him.  For people like me, these reissues (he died a couple years ago, in case you didn't know) are great.  I get a chance to read his work, even stuff that was previously out of print.<br />BLOOD GAMES is proof that Laymon knows what he's doing.  Since THE TRAVELING VAMPIRE SHOW (one of the best horror novels of all time, I should add), his published novels have seemed to go down in quality; now, for a Laymon book, there's a LONG way to fall.  His novels are, quite simply, superb.  BLOOD GAMES is arguably the best of his novels published since VAMPIRE SHOW.  And that's saying a lot.<br />The flashbacks to the girls' college days should hinder the plot, one would think; instead, you find yourself racing further and further into it, anxious to know just what happens.  Typical Laymon.<br />This isn't a supernatural thriller.  Don't go into it thinking that it is.  Laymon tackles what most horror authors--including King--don't: the darkness of human nature.  BLOOD GAMES, as well as most any other Laymon novel you pick up, is about that dark little part of us that delights in horror and bloodshed.  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.<br />BLOOD GAMES scared the crap out of me.  And that ain't easy.  So, what the hell are you waiting for?  You want some good, gory horror with quite a bit of character development thrown in?  Pick up BLOOD GAMES.

But then again, Hunt Jackson and his new wife and friends aren't plagued by a normal insurance agent.  We're talking about a guy who suddenly walks out of your guest bedroom; a guy who seems to have a second personality hidden below his exterior smile...<br />And he doesn't work for a normal insurance company.  The Insurance Group offers some of the strangest insurance policies known to man; policies, in fact, that seem to be invented due to whatever your current situation in life is...<br />And if you do not buy these policies, something will happen to make you change your mind.<br />For Hunt, it is imprisonment as a child molester.  For his wife, it is the removal of her teeth.  For his friend, it is a life-threatening accident at work.<br />And there seems to be not a thing they can do to stop it.  Insurance, after all, is a necessity.<br />Bentley Little has been known to satirize certain aspects of American life.  \\"The Ignored,\\" for example, talked about a man who was so ordinary he simply disappears; \\"The Association\\" talks about a home owner's association that takes things to the max.  Here, it is insurance and insurance policies.<br />And it is frightening.<br />Little manages to take mediocre plots/characters and combine them into something that no one else--not even, ladies and gentelmen, Stephen King--could write.  Little's novels do not challenge you to think; they scare you.  That is what a good horror novel should do, I think.<br />And Bentley Little's \\"The Policy\\" scares you.

Jack naturally kills the gunman...and the only person to get a good look at Jack's face is a reporter looking for his big break...<br />And, yes, there is yet another subplot: the story makes the headlines, yes indeed, and gosh darned if it doesn't catch the eyes of the Kozlowski Brothers, a couple of Jack's old enemies.  They're angry and looking to settle a score...<br />Repairman Jack is thrust yet again into a topsy-turvy world where right becomes wrong, and reality becomes something more--and less--than normal.

But the Repairman Jack novels ARE good, VERY GOOD.  They feature one of the most unique heroes in modern fiction: a guy who will willingly risk his life for those he works for, and yet has a woman and child he loves.  Repairman Jack is human...and that's what makes him so real.<br />F. Paul Wilson strikes gold yet again, folks.  Pick this up!<br />(Really, I mean get this novel!

Do those boys mean them trouble?  What about the local wildlife, lik the cougars?  Or the shadowy figure that seems to be dogging their every move?<br />Then there is Gillian.  She is a unique housebreaker--she goes into people's homes and lives there while they're on vacation.  (For those of you who read \\"Night in the Lonesome October\\", you might wonder if Laymon had a fetish for this type of thing.)  However, Gillian chose the wrong house.  For one thing, she is getting too involved with the mysterious next door neighbor.  For another, the house's occupant seems to have a few odd hobbies...like murder...<br />Richard Laymon manages to do what only a select few authors (say, J. N. Williamson and Rick Hautala, for example) can do: take a cheap, cliche horror story, loaded with gore and sex and violence, and turn it into a suspensful romp of terror.  If anybody else had written this novel, I wouldn't have even bothered to review it.  But Laymon's skill is evident here: this cheesy horror tale is elevated to a new level.<br />If you don't buy that philisophical [stuff], try this: \\"No Sanctuary\\" is a damn good read!

For this reason, Ethan must solve it himself, with just a little bit of help from a few friends in the department.

After all, isn't that Brenner's job?<br />But there's a catch: this murder was committed thirty years ago.<br />But Brenner, under pressure from his girlfriend and simple boredom, takes the job.  As soon as he arrives in contemporary Vietnam, he is hit by how much the country has changed.  But to solve this crime, Brenner must live in the past--after all, the murder was committed during the War, at the same time Brenner was here.<br />Obviously, a thirty-year-old crime won't be easy to solve.  Throw into the mix a sexy, mysterious \\"ally\\", a cunning Vietnamese colonel, and a whole host of slick, conniving characters, and you see that Brenner has got an almost impossible mission.  And there is always the nagging thought in Brenner's head: he knows his government didn't tell him everything.

This is much a look into Brenner's--and DeMille's--psyche as it is about a murder investigation.

Now there're a few complications in their search: one of the students has a past that literally comes back to haunt them; the professor, guilt-driven, heads into the mountains to find them; and oh, yes, there's a maniac with a really big knife.<br />Okay, so it's not too realistic; not that any horror novel ever is.  However, Laymon usually manages to convince us that yes, indeed, those vampires are out there.  This novel lacks that power to convince, but hey, it IS suspensful, and it is a gory ride.  Richard Laymon always thrills; &quot;Darkness, Tell Us,&quot; is no exception.  Dig in; you might find the treasure...or you might find a maniac with a knife.	2003-03-10

I am a dedicated Koontz fan, have been for a few years, but what is it about him that attracts me?  I must be perfectly honest: this book seemed fluffy to me, at first.  So did his last, and the one before that.  But why, then, am I hooked after reading the VERY FIRST WORD.  Yes, that's right; it's a cliche, but I was hooked after the first word.  He always does that to me, and I can't explain why.<br />Maybe it's the plot and the characters.  Here, Koontz presents two people who are as real as you or I: Dylan, an artist travelling the country with his retarded brother Shep; and Jilly, a struggling comedian with a past that causes her to hate men.  Two entirely un-related people, perfect strangers, until they are assaulted by the same man--a \\"Frankenstein\\" doctor, who injects them both with a mysterious substance.<br />It isn't long before weird things start to happen.  Jilly begins to predict a massacre at a church, while Dylan is suddenly overcome by the urge to just GO certain places...and stop the crimes happening there.  And Shep is maybe affected the strangest of all...because he has this unique ability to transport himself miles away...and across time...<br />But they are being hunted by enemies of the doctor.  But in this guess, the enemy of my enemy is NOT my friend.  Pursued by men who do not hesitate in killing, Dylan, Jilly, and Shep must try to survive the guns and bullets...in order to see if they will surive the liquid that flows through their veins.<br />A novel packed with revelation, with characters that jump off the pages and sit next to you, BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON is perfect Dean Koontz.  Maybe that is why I was hooked; because perfect Koontz is as perfect as you can get.	2003-01-05

He writes horror with no restrictions whatsoever.  If you want to learn something while you read, if you want a theme in your story, read King or Laymon--hell, you're probably like me and read them anyway!  But if you just want to be scared...<br />Then pick up a Bentley Little novel.<br />And why not start with &quot;The Return.&quot;  Yes, it's complex, and pretty much meaningless.  The plot itself is un-realistic as heck, and you characters are shallow, despite attempts to bring their past into the mix.  But this novel is scary; it's very scary.<br />A little recap of the plot, although if you're a Little fan, you know you don't need one: Glen is going through midlife crisis.  He drops everything and just leaves.  In Arizona, while on a tour of an Anasazi ruin, he gets offered a job at an archeological dig.  For reasons unknown to himself, he takes up that offer...and finds himself in Hell on Earth!<br />Sure, there's Melanie, whom he's quickly falling in love with.  And the dig's director, Al, is friendly.  So're some of the other diggers.  But he doesn't like it.  Especially not after he digs up that skull; because that's when the townfolk start taking a disliking to him and the diggers; that's when the Indian artifacts start moving on their own; when people start disappearing right out of thin air; and when a legend--The Mogollon Monster--seems more than just a myth.<br />If I have to be honest--and I do--I will say that this novel reflects a more mature Bentley Little--not that we want one.  The gore is kept, for the large part, until the second half of the book.  But when it comes, it comes in full-force.  And when you aren't being grossed out, you're checking to make sure nobody's sneaking up behind you.<br />A brief warning, here at the end: Do not read &quot;The Return&quot; at night, unless you're prepared to lose sleep.  This novel, like all of Little's, is packed full of frights.  A must for Little fans, and a good introductory course for new recruits.rights.

Spielberg may have done a great--heck, terrific--job on the silver screen, but even his movie (Sam Neil, Jeff Goldbloom, Laura Dern, Wayne Knight, the best of the best) can't compare to the original...the novel.<br />Isla Nublar.  Isolated off the coast of Costa Rico.  Tropical, mountenous, surrounded by choppy cliffs and deadly seas.<br />Oh, yeah, and it's home to InGen's dinosaur-cloning facility.<br />A theme park...complete with rides, adventure, thrills, and dinosaurs.  These are REAL dinosaurs, mind you.  Created from DNA located in amber.  All at the request of the eccentric John Hammond.  Hammond's old, and he wants one last thrill in his life.  He wants to see children go crazy over the dinosaurs...and he will stop at nothing to meet his goals.<br />Lewis Dodgson is Hammond's rival in the genetric research business.  Dodgson doesn't like Hammond's sucess...and so he inserts Dennis Nedry into the personell.  Nedry's mission: get as many embryoes as you can and get them off the island.<br />Enter Grant and Ellie, a paleontologist and paleobotonist, respectively, who have a close relationship both on and off the field.  They are summonded by Hammond to take a tour of the island, see if it is \\"authentic\\" enough.  They agree (albiet with a little money incentive, they are only human afterall) and are flown to the island.  They are not alone on the tour: with them are Ian Malcom, mathmetician and chaos theory extrordinaire; Donald Genero, the lawyer; and Lex and Tim, Hammond's grandchildren.<br />The tour goes disastrously wrong, as a hurricane hits and Nedry makes his move, shutting the park's power off.  The electrical fences once keeping the dinosaurs in their confines become nothing more than annoying pieces of string.  And after a suspensful and tragic attack, Alan and the kids become seperated from the rest...and lost on the island.<br />If you watched the movie just for the dinosaurs, and not for the characters, you can still read this book.  It features a wider range of beasts, all of them scarrier and truer-to-life than Spielberg's monsters.

US	49466298	R8796HYX3AAM	0743455967	44310359	On Writing	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A masterpiece.  Plain and simple.	Stephen King knows how to engross you in a novel like no one else.  He knows how to take you into a character's mind and keep you prisoner there until you're begging for mercy.  He knows how to frighten you with his other-worldly (and sometimes too-real) villains.  He knows how to keep you up until the wee hours of the morning turning the pages.<br />Now he does it with non-fiction.<br />&quot;On Writing&quot; is, in my opinion (and that of many, many others) the best damn book on writing that ever existed.  But don't for a minute be turned off by the fact that this isn't a novel; King's done this before (&quot;Danse Macabre&quot;) and still has the knack.  However, unlike the afore mentioned book, &quot;On Writing&quot; does not stay in the horror genre; King knows that there are fans of other genres that will read this, and tells it in a way that all can understand.<br />The first part of this book is a minor autobiography.  It is not meant to be that way, but it is.  You get snapshots of King's life, of why he writes the way he does.  You will laugh, you will worry, and you will cry.  That is his intent.  King does this for a living, remember.<br />The second part of the book is, no pun intended, on writing.  King will go into  subjects such as grammar and editing, things that we all yawn at when we hear them in normal life.  But this, people, is not normal life: this is Stephen King's life.  He will captivate you with his vivid descriptions of adverbs (my favorite being &quot;Rocks explode, Jane transmits, mountains float, and plums deify.&quot;)  He will astound you while he's comparing/contasting works of literature.<br />Make no mistake: Stephen King knows what he's doing with this book.  And what is that, you ask?  Why, he's teaching you!  But &quot;On Writing&quot; is a perfect example of how school doesn't always have to be boring.	2002-07-16

How could a Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child novel rank fewer than five stars?  In actuality, I would give all of their works somewhere around eight stars, any more than that being strictly for classics.  However, these two authors are bound to write a classic one day, so it's only a matter of time.<br />Back to \\"The Cabinet of Curiousities.\\"  I highly suggest you read \\"Relic\\", \\"Thunderhead,\\" and possibly \\"Reliquary\\" before you read this novel (all available here at Amazon.com for your convenience!).  This new novel ties in characters from those afore-mentioned: Special Agent Pendergast from the \\"Relic\\" duo; Nora Kelly from \\"Thunderhead\\"; and Bill Smithback (now William Smithback Jr.) from all three.  This is an odd ensamble of characters, but it works out surprisingly well.<br />The plot: A major tourist attraction in the late 1800's were the \\"Cabinets of Curiousities\\", a collection of rare--and mostly fake--artifacts from the world-over (think Ripley's Believe It or Not, only darker).  One such cabinet is found in modern-day New York on a construction site...along with thirty-six corpses.  In comes mysterious Agent Pendergast: pale, thin, intelligent, and all-together weird (and yet he's my favorite fictional hero).  He rousts up archeologist Nora Kelly from her job at the New York Museum of Natural History, who has experience in rare digs (read \\"Thunderhead\\").  Before her examination of the site is over, a multi-millionaire construction guru destroys the site, as it stands in the way of his building.<br />And the hunt begins to solve these hundred-year-old murders.  Scientific details abound, as does the suspense when Kelly begins to realize that someone in the Musuem is working to keep any information of the corpses a secret.  She asks her boyfriend Smithback (their relationship is rocky, to say the least) to aid her.  If you are familiar with Smithback's character, you know he is a very flawed hero, and of course he ends up using his journalistic talents to make things worse for our heroine.  But Kelly begins to uncover something, something that is so horrible that it is almost impossible to believe...<br />And the killings start.  They have the same M.O., and could be done by the previous killer...who, of course, is dead.  The murders were a hundred years ago.  He couldn't still be killing, could he?<br />Pendergast thinks so, but his investigation into the new murders is in trouble right from the start.  And to make matters worse, the killer has a list of victims...and Nora Kelly's name is at the top.<br />An interesting surprise in this novel is the in-depth characterization of Pendergast, who has, until now, remained completely and utterly mysterious (he doesn't even have a first name!).  But in this novel you get to know the man somewhat better, and it is a treat worth waiting for.<br />That may seem like a complete summary of the book, but believe me, it is only the tip of the ice-berg.  To view the rest (and what's left is by far the best), you must buy the book.  And, since you're here, why not do it now?

Bentley Little has an ability few other people writing today have: the ability to scare the socks off ANYONE!  The stories he presents to us here, in a book apporpriately called \\"The Collection,\\" are no less than his best.  And that, my friends, is something worth checking out.<br />The stories here vary widely, and some aren't even horror at all.  In fact, one deals with the possibility that the Revolutionary War had ended quite differently.  Another, along similar lines, asks us the question, \\"How much do we really know about our founding fathers?\\"<br />Then, of course, you have the spine-tinglers.  Ghost towns are brought up repeatedly, as Little knows how to wring out the best of those stereotypical settings.  In one story, a man just says something, and it happens!  In another, an anbandoned town's trash turns out to be more than just litter!  And in yet another story guaranteed to frighten you half-to-death, Little brings back the bathhouse from his awesome novel \\"The Town.\\"  This time, it \\"flies\\" away into horror (you'll understand when you read it).<br />This is definitely a \\"Collection\\" that I am glad to have on my bookshelf.  Though Little's imagination is sometimes extremely morbid (even more-so than mine!) he never fails to write a good story.  As a bonous, along with each installment in this collection, Little includes a small passage of how the story came about, and why he likes it.<br />This is Bentley Little's latest gift to us.  He brings us his fears of fanatics, voodoo witches, zombies, nightmares, paper, potatoes, and midgets, and gift-wraps them between two covers.  So open up and enjoy.  Just don't turn off the lights.	2002-06-13

Robert Crais has proven again and again that he can keep us on the edge of our seats, and yet at the same time laughing our butts off, to be polite.  &quot;Free Fall&quot; is a perfect example of that.  It is an installment in the &quot;Elvis Cole Series&quot;, but you do not have to have read any of the previous novels to read this one: I didn't.  I've read other Cole novels, but they've been written after this one.<br />Anyway, this novel takes place in Los Angeles.  It finds Elvis Cole sitting in his office, just another normal day.  In walks an innocent looking young woman named Jenifer Sheridan.  She tells Cole that she has a problem: She thinks her fiancee, Mark Thurman, is involved in something illegal.  Willingly, unwillingly?  It is Cole's task to find out the answer, and just what exactly Thurman is up to.  Could it be another woman?  Or is it something much worse, something much deadlier?<br />Cole and his partner, Joe Pike, find themselves up against rogue cops, South-side gangsters, and a haunting mystery.  Oh, yeah: They're also wanted by the cops for murder.<br />Only Crais could weave a novel this complicated and powerful.  You'll be loving every minute of &quot;Free Fall&quot;, I promise you.

Yes, it sounds wierd, but Stephen King and Peter Straub got together in the eighties and wrote this fantasy novel.  If you're familiar with either's work, you know that this is going ot be a great book.  So, I guess I'll let you read the summary, as written by myself.<br />Jack Sawyer is only twelve, but he's about to go on the journey of a lifetime.  His mother is dying, and what she needs to survive resides in California...But Jack is on the east coast.  He must get there alone, by himself,and quickly, for not only his mother's life hangs in the balance, but that of a woman Jack doesn't know, a woman who is the queen of a land Jack has never heard of...The Territories.<br />Jack's father could travel to this strange land, buy simply wishing it to happen.  Jack soon learns that he, too, can do it, and finds that traveling in the Territories covers much more land than in the real world.  For instance...Say he &quot;travels&quot; to the Territories from one point, and walks half a mile.  When Jack &quot;travels&quot; back, he finds he's walked two miles!  Getting to California should be easy, right?<br />Wrong.  For Jack's evil Uncle Morgan does not want Jack to succeed.  He wants Jack's mother--and the Queen of the Territories--to die, for then Morgan's &quot;Twinner&quot; (the copy of yourself in the Territories) could take control of the strange land and spread his harshness.<br />So Jack's journey is two-fold: Save his mother (and the Queen) and stop Uncle Morgan from taking over the Territories.  Since he can't do this alone, Jack makes several friends that help him along the way, and the entire story comes together in a conclusion that'll leave you on the edge of your seat.<br />Did you understand any of this?  I hope not, for it should make you want to buy the book even more.  Trust me, &quot;The Talisman&quot; is worth every penny you sink into it, for it is an adventure of the ages, filled with excitement, suspense, humor, horror, and the struggles of one boy on a desperate quest.

The smaller businesses are either forced out of business, bought out, or mysteriously burnt to the ground.  That's not all.  The Store features items not commonly found in public places.  Sex videos, other items that should not be available.  Dangerous items are found in the children's section, at amazingly low prices affordable to all ages.

But once in the cabin he discovers that the answers may come with a steep and terrible price...a price paid in life and death.<br />Even as the nightmares start again, even as he comes to realize Sara Laughs is haunted (by whom, he does not know), Mike is thrown into a custody battle between poor, young, widowed Mattie Devore, and her rich, old, evil father-in-law, Max Devore.  The subject of their disagreements: Kyra, three-year old girl Mike rescues purely by chance.  He is drawn to both the girl and Mattie, and quickly falls in love with both.  But Devore is scheming to get Mattie into his own custody...and will stop at nothing to do so.<br />This is a rich and complex book.  I will be openly honest: this is my number-one favorite book I've ever read...and I've read A LOT.  Here's a short, true story: I sat down for close to an hour and just read, never once looking up from the pages.  After an hour passed, I stopped reading...and suddenly I was Michael Noonan, I was seeing what he saw, I was feeling what he felt, and I expected at any moment to see the ghostly figure that haunts his nightmares.  That had never happened to me before or since.  Stephen King is the master of horror, but he brings something else to this novel: compassion.  Mike, Mattie, Kyra, and even Max Devore are all-too-real characters, and you will both love them and hate them.  Buy \\"Bag of Bones\\"; it's bound to become a classic.ment to see the ghostly figure that haunts his nightmares.   That had never happened to me before or since.

This was a first-person novel in the tradition of Dean Koontz's FEAR NOTHING, which I also recomend.  PLUM ISLAND had all the  humor anyone could ask for, a little romance, and an excellent chase scene  with boats during a hurricane.  Try to guess who-dunit.  You'll have a  good time with this book, I guarantee!	2000-06-26

I swear this is one of the best novels I've ever read.  I've read his other novels (I'm rewriting this review, as the first one was short and pathetic and not nearly worthy of the novel) and while they are good, this one takes the prize.<br />Ashley Carter is picked to lead a team into the world beneath Antartica.  Every person on the team is the best in their field, including the military escort.  They are there because the first team vanished...and hasn't been heard from since.<br />What they find will shock you and amaze you.  The world below ours, painted beautifull by Rollins, is a wonderful place, yet filled with danger that lurks around every corner.  And the mysteries keep piling up, and the screams begin echoing...and Carter must wonder what lies just ahead...or even further below.<br />This is a terrific novel.  Buy it right now!  You won't regret it!	2000-06-03
