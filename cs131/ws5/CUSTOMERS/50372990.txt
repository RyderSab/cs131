Widely used in Catholic colleges, it is undoubtedly the clearest and easiest-to-read Ethics text ever published. The author says that no book can take the place of a professor in the classroom, but this one virtually does-and Fr. Fagothey says he wrote it that way. Though issued in 1959, it remains remarkably contemporary and can be read basically by any adult-either in toto or as a handy reference to look up topics in question. Phrased in non-technical language, Right and Reason is a thoroughly competent book in the philosophy of Ethics, which gives the science of morality from the Aristotelian-Thomistic, common-sense school of thought-which is none other than the Perennial Philosophy of the Ages, the philosophy outside of which one's positions quickly become absurd and all reasoning ends up in dead-ends.<br />He covers the whole field of Ethics, posing and answering the perennial questions; for example: What makes the right right and the wrong wrong? What is moral obligation and where does it come from? Why is divorce always wrong? Why is abortion always wrong? When is it moral to kill another person? Do animals have rights? What is the origin of the State? Who has the right to educate? Is capital punishment ethical? Is there a right to work? What is a just wage? What is a just war? What is the principle of double effect? Are suicide and euthanasia against the Natural Law? Is there a Natural Law? etc.<br />The classic principles of Ethics are as valid today as ever, and anyone who attempts to grapple with today's new moral questions-in medical ethics, family issues, international relations, etc.-without a solid grounding in these classic principles is guaranteed to flounder around in the swamp of guesswork, emotional thinking and mere personal opinion. Every educated Catholic and every educated person-if he is to think correctly on moral issues-must be familiar with the great ethical questions and their classic solutions, solutions such as presented in Fr. Fagothey's clear and masterful work, Right and Reason, which for today's confused world is a beacon of common sense written with an authoritative competence that no one can effectively argue against.	2001-03-29

Preached by that great yet gentle Doctor of the Church, St. Francis de Sales moves easily over both New and Old Testaments, especially the Song of Songs.

St. Francis de Sales also shows clearly that Mary, by her holy example of the virtues, is the great Mistress or teacher for every Christian's life. Revealing the Spiritual depths of the smallest Scriptural details, he explains the great value and true meaning of these virtues, so central to holiness of life. Terrific insights! 219pp. PB.

At the beginning of the 16th century, Rome was corrupt and lukewarm, and the people lived in a stte of spiritual laxity. But by the end of hte century, Rome was a different city, largely because of one man - St. Philip Neri.<br />At the age of 29, while praying most earnestly for the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, Philip had an extraordinary experience of divine love, and from that tim eon there began a palpitation of his heart which lasted the rest of his life. At times it became so violent that it shook his chair, his bed or even his whole room. He also felt a sense of burning heat in the region of his heart and throat, so taht he was always trying to keep cool. After his death, his heart was found to be son enlarged that the two ribs over it were broken and arched outwards - they had been like this for 50 years!<br />Fired with this love of God, Philip converted and sanctified innumerable souls by preaching in teh marketplaces, by hearing confessions and directing souls, by counseling bishops and popes, by caring for the sick in the primitive hospitals, and by preforming miracles - he raised one young boy from the dead.<br />The distinctive mark of his apostolate was his cheerfulness. &quot;I will have no melancholy, no low spirits in my house,&quot; he used to say. St. Philip exerted an incalculable influence for good upon the Universal Church, which owes him - even to our own time - a dept of unimaginable gratitude. 117pp. PB. Imprimatur.	2001-03-15

During her lifetime (1515-1582), St. Teresa captivated just about everyone she met by her wit, sanity, courage, intelligence, simplicity, humility, charm and power; today she continues to delight people by her wonderful combination of holy madness and huge common sense. William Thomas Walsh recounts Teresa's years of resisting complete self-surrender to God before finally entering with undivided will on the way of perfection; of her terrible anguish over the Lutheran heretics falling into Hell and of the grievous penances and sacrifices she undertook for their conversion, and of her many adventures in opening up houses of cloistered contemplative nuns.

According to author Randy Engel, this &quot;education&quot; is designed to destroy natural modesty in children, awaken the passions, and pressure them to accept all sexual sins and perversions like homosexuality as normal. Classroom sex education is a grave moral evil, a serious occasion of sin, is all-pervasive, is taking place in most Catholic (as well as public) grade and high schools, and is being allowed - and promoted - by those in position of authority in the Catholic Church, including bishops, priests and nuns. Mrs. Engel's book, Sex Education-The Final Plague, explains where this moral plague came from, who is promoting it in Catholic schools today, and the Vatican's response to it. She calls for the Church to put a total ban on all school &quot;sex education&quot; programs. All Catholic parents should read this book in order to be armed against one of the gravest moral dangers facing our children today. 228pp. PB.	2001-03-15

Using procedures of systems analysis, the author has drawn from a multiplicity of disciplines including philosophy, theology, physics, psychology, sociology and mathematics. The history of man's though concerning himself and his relationship to God is traced through the ages, beginning with Plato and Aristotle, right up to our present age.<br />The book demonstrates that a stable society is not possible without a morality based on some theistic system toward which man &quot;stands in awe&quot; (the Hobbesian question). A basis for a sociology of morals - and hence a moral sociology - is formulated. And finally, the author proposes a methodology by which the present decadent world age will be changed, during the next few decades, to bring about a return of the world to a truly human civilization.<br />The &quot;insistent dialectic&quot; is that interior conflict which has existed in man from the beginning - symbolically in the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. Man is split in his view of himself. He wants to be totally independent of any external restraint - free to &quot;do his own thing.&quot; Yet, he realizes that he is in fact constrained by his own limited resources. He does have a master - if not of divine dimensions, then of human dimensions - his own fragility and mortality. He cannot live exclusively in his own image.<br />The book uses two scenarios to display the insistent dialectic. First is that of Nietzche, who wrote toward the end of the 19th century. An atheistic existentialist, he saw the 20th century as a descent into nihilism - man becoming totally anarchistic, having no values in common. Nietzsche saw emerging in the 21st century a &quot;master race&quot; which would tyrannize the rest of mankind into following along like cattle.<br />The other scenario is that of the late great British historian Arnold Toynbee, who consigned the twentieth century to technology but saw the 21st characterized by a return to theistic belief and a period of great spiritual growth. The two scenarios are antithetical and well reflect the insistent dialectic in its modern setting. This modern viewpoint has been of relatively short duration, a brief candle in the history of man.<br />The author believes that while the present situation of the world favors the Nietzsche scenario, there are signs of dissatisfaction with man's view of himself as a &quot;Trousered Ape&quot; or a &quot;Walking Bag of Seawater&quot; - as an intelligen monstrosity in an otherwise fairly satisfactory biolog world. Man is forlorn in his own image - hopelessly flawed in attaining his goals and flawed in his hopelessness of any other.<br />The author sees the denouement of the two scenarios in the realm of major religiously inspired social movements which will arise during the last decade of this century and during the early stages of the upcoming age. God remains the &quot;Master of History.&quot; One way or another, man will serve God - in joy or in anguish. The choice is ours.	2001-03-08

Written by a pre-eminent authority, with brevity, economy and absence of novelty or speculation or &quot;merely metaphorical expressions.&quot; The book is suffused with the spirit of faith and inspired by love begotten of sanctity. Shows how Mary is greater in grace than all angels and all men combined. Explains her role in relation to us: How she is the Mother of all men and of each individually; her role as Co-Redemptrix of all men; her power of intercession for us and in the distribution of all graces; her Queenship of Heaven and earth and the honor of hyperdulia we pay her, which is best expressed in true devotion to Mary; why true devotion to Mary is such a certain means of sanctification; and finally, why the human race should be consecrated to Mary for the peace of the world. A comprehensive yet concise statement of all that the Church teaches about Mary. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that anyone having read this masterpiece of Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange will ever again question the exalted position of Mary recognized by the Church or ever thereafter denigrate or question her stature in the order of nature or of grace. 290pp. PB.

No sacramental since the Rosary has had such an impact on the Church. The author spent 10 years in research, studying many documents never before available. What he has produced is a definitive life of the Saint which is both highly readable and inspiring. You will come to love St. Catherine Laboure, will see in her a woman of incredible strength and character, of unbelievable constancy, of kindness, humility, obedience and self-effacement. Here was a saint who, from her early years was &quot;entirely mystic,&quot; to quote her sister; who from age 12 served 10 years as mistress to her father's large household of 17 (five family members and 12 farm hands), who worked 40 years with constant fidelity running an old man's retirement-nursing home for her order; who after the Miraculous Medal apparitions, would speak to the Blessed Mother at any time she chose and be answered by Our Lady; who was a tower of strength to her order during two revolutions; and who made innumerable prophecies that came true.

At the early age of 15, she broke a rib and took to her bed, where she remained the rest of her life. Her mysterious illness, at first thought to be of natural causes, was soon discovered to have supernatural origins. As the author states, &quot;Like other Saints of her century, she gave herself in expiation for the souls in Purgatory, for the abominations of schism, for the excesses of clerks and monks, for the delinquencies of kigns and people; but besides this sacrifice, by which she undertook to atone for the sins committed from one end of the universe to the other, she also bore the burden of scapegoat for her own country.&quot;<br /> According to the revelations of Anne Catherine Emmerich, she was suffering voluntary expiation for the welfare of the Church. Her condition became so bad that at one time she had virtually come apart into three pieces - her body reflecting symbolically the condition of the Church. St. Lydwine, besides eating no food, was often wrapped in ecstacy and manifested numerous phenomena typical of mystics, most noticeable of which was a strong and delectable perfume. Her incredible story makes fascinating and inspiring reading because St. Lydwine ranks as one of the most heroic victim souls of all time. 252 pages, paperbound, imprimatur.	2001-03-08

She was a twin, the 23rd of 25 children, a mystic, a stigmatic and a miracle-worker. Her penances were so great that she eventually ate no food - except Holy Communion - and did not require sleep. Through her personal influence, thousands of people returned to the Faith. Her crowning achievement consisted of persuading Pope Gregory XI to return to the Papacy in Rome, thus ending the &quot;Babylonian Captivity.&quot; During much of Catherine's brief life she labored valiantly to end the &quot;Great Western Schism&quot; (two Popes), to reconcile the warring states of Italy, and to have the Church preach a crusade against the Turks. St. Catherine died at age 33, the victim of her own strenuous efforts and penances on behalf of the Church. Her 400 letters - to Popes and to religious and political leaders of high and low estate - testify to these efforts. Toward the end of her life, while in ecstasy, she dictated her famous Dialogue with God the Father, which has become one of the great spiritual treasures of the Church. For this writing and for her letters, Pope Paul VI declared her a Doctor of the Church. St. Catherine of Siena is so appealing because she literally consumed herself for the sake of souls and for the welfare of Christ's Church. 268 pages, Imprimatur.	2001-03-08

The express purpose of this devotion is to offset the blasphemies and outrages of &quot;Revolutionary men&quot; (the Communists) - through whom God is allowing the world to be chastised for its disbelief - as well as of atheists and freethinkers, for blasphemy and profanations of Sundays by Christians. Specifically, this devotion is the divine tool given by God to defeat Communism, and an unfailing method for individuals in appealing to God through prayer. Our Lord gave Sr. Mary a short but powerful prayer called &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; by which a person can &quot;shoot directly into the Heart of God.&quot; The editor of the book states that this devotion brought St. Therese, the &quot;Little Flower&quot;, to her great sanctity.

Though well suited to his role, he chose instead to renounce the world and become a Jesuit. This meant he could never even become a member of the hierarchy, which his family would otherwise have surely seen to in his life as a priest. No. He renounced everything: His name, his titles, his heritage, his fame, his glory, his luxury - to become a Jesuit priest. It would be hard to believe that any other saint in the history of the Church ever achieved his religious vocation against more opposition. And yet, having achieved it, he was to live only another five years. However, St. Mary Magdalene di Pazzi saw him in vision shortly after he died and proclaimed, &quot;O how great is the glory enjoyed by Aloysius, the son of Ignatius! Never would I have believed it, if Jesus had not shown it to me. It seems to me that there can be none greater in Heaven. I assure you Aloysius is a great saint. We have saints (relics) in our church (the Carmelite) who do not possess such glory. Would that I could go through the whole world and proclaim that Aloysius, the son of Ignatius is a great saint, and show everyone his glory, that God might be glorified!&quot; What was the cause of such glory? What is there in the obscure life of St. Aloysius Gonzaga that Holy Mother Church wishes to hold before the young people of the world by proclaiming him &quot;Patron of Christian Youth?&quot; A reading of Father Meschler's biography will give that answer in a truly satisfying manner!	2001-03-08

The author's integrity and objectivity won him exclusive interviews with a great number of the Cardinal and Bishops, whatever their allegiance within the Council. The title neatly sums up the fact that Vatican II, and the documents of Vatican II, were shaped largely by the liberal ideas of the Fathers from the Rhine lands. In The Rhine Flows into the Tiber, the strategies of the liberals in promoting their ideas come through on every page. Father Wiltgen's journalistic masterpiece shows clearly the two main theological forces that were at work in the church before the Council, during the Council, and after the Council, and which remain very much at work in the Church today. Here are the actions and actual words of the famous personalities of the Council, including Cardinals Ottaviani, Frings, and Suenens; Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre; Fathers Karl Rahner, Joseph Rarringer, and Hans Kung - and of course, Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI. This book is essential for anyone who would understand the new orientations which came to the fore with Vatican Council II - including the famous &quot;Spirit of Vatican II&quot; orientations which have led to momentous destruction and unprecedented changes in the entire Roman Catholic Church.

Also, it can itself be used as an advanced textbook and thus is sometimes referred to as Baltimore Catechism #4. It was written both as an aid to all those who would be teaching from the Numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 Catechisms, and as a more complete statement of the Faith. Its purpose is to explain the questions in greater detail than do the earlier books in order to supply the catechist with additional information to enhance his instruction. To provide easy reference, questions bear the same numbers as in Catechism 1 and 2. For giving additional classroom dimension, for use as a textbook, or for just interesting reading, its fascinating explanations of many little known questions pertaining to our Faith will richly reward the questioning reader.	2001-03-08

This great Doctor of the Church walks the beginner through several important decisions which lead to choosing the devout life.

Finally he shows us how we are to fulfill our religious obligations and how we are to conduct ourselves in the world as devout Catholics. Covers prayer, how to meditate, Confession, frequent Communion, recreation, dancing, dress, poverty (both actual and spiritual), chastity, obedience, humility, slander, rash judgement, good and evil friendships, etc. Includes special instructions for husbands and wives on marriage.

The life of a Saint, written by a Saint, speaks to the heart with a vital power which no work of merely natural genius can command. It has a twofold operation of the Spirit of God with it, both in the subject and in the writer. Among uninspired books there are few that breathe more sensibly the love of God than this famous work. &quot;There is a light and a sweetness about it which is not of this world,&quot; says Cardinal Manning. St. Thomas writes about finding St. Bonaventure in his cell writing this work in ecstasy, and drawing back from the door exclaiming, &quot;Let us leave a Saint to work for a Saint.&quot; St. Bonaventure conveys a picture of St. Francis through his miracles (including turning water into wine, raising people from the dead, commanding water to flow from bare rock and even curing the author of a childhood illness), his sayings (even the animals were exulted at the sound of his voice) and his holy life that renders an indelible impression of a man totally transformed in God and by God. In short, St. Bonaventure presents the life of a man who was like a seraph - an angel in human form - for no other word but &quot;angel&quot; can truly describe the beloved St. Francis of Assisi.	2001-03-08

Based on Scripture and Tradition, this book gives the history of Catholic thought on this topic, showing how centuries of Catholic theologians have wrestled to reconcile the two truths of divine predilection and the damnation of souls. Explains the teachings of Sts. Augustine, St. Anselm, Peter Lombard, St. Bonaventure, St. Albert the Great, Duns Scotus, St. Robert Bellarmine, Suarez, etc. He also analyzes the problems with Molinism, Congruism, Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, Protestantism (Luther, Zwingli, Calvin), Baianism and Jansenism.<br />Fr. Garrigou-Lagrange sheds the great light of St. Thomas Aquinas on these questions, emphasizing the gratuity of Predestination and the absolutely fundamental principle of hte divine predilection. He also covers efficacious and sufficient grace, free will, God's antecedent and consequent will, His justice, His mercy, and the question of whether foreknowledge of merits is the cause of predestination. This book is a magnificent exposition for serious students and for all seekign a deep, theological understanding of the Catholic myster of Predestination. 382 pages, PB. Imprimatur.	2001-03-08

This delightful work, which contains 10 photos, captures the brilliant, forceful, hard-working, zealous, ardent holy man who became the first canonized Pope in 342 years, the Pope whom St. Malachy had prophetically described some 750 years before as &quot;A Blazing Fire.&quot; Covers his fight against the improper interpretation of the separation of Church and State and his challenge to the Catholic World &quot;to restore all things in Christ.&quot; Delightful! 125pp. PB.

About Father Lamy, his bishop said, &quot;I have in my diocese another Cur of Ars.&quot; This holy priest had visions of the past and of the future, of Our Lord, the Blessed Mother, St. Joseph, the Angels - even Lucifer. The accomplishments of his life are an amazing proof what one priest can do. Profound and enlightening are his thoughts on religious subjects. He prayed the Rosary almost continually, slept but one or two hours a night, could smell sin even through a penitent's perfume, conversed regularly with his guardian angel, effected miracles, and made prophecies. He was a priest to rag pickers and school children, and his account of the times and life around the village where he spent his childhood is more Catholic than on any spot on earth today.

In fact, little mention is made of him there. Yet, despite these seeming limitations, the Church nonetheless possesses an indescribably rich knowledge of St. Joseph and of his cultus. This book will astound most readers both with its scope and with its profundity. Based mainly on Scripture, but supported also by Tradition and the depositions of saints, it is a carefully reasoned analysis of the entirety of that great saint's role in the history of Salvation and the life of the Church. Here we find discussed the age, appearance and occupation of St. Joseph; his character, spiritual life and noble lineage - he was a son of David and therefore by rights a king; how he was prefigured in the Old Testament; his relationship to Mary and Jesus; why he has been named by Pope Pius IX &quot;The Patron of the Universal Church;&quot; and so forth. Many beautiful insights are contained here, for example: St. Joseph can be truly called the father of Jesus in that he served as the model for the formation of the Divine Humanity of Our Lord. Because Mary and Joseph were closely related, Jesus looked like St. Joseph, thus concealing from the world Jesus' true identity until His Public Life. Joseph's work became the work of Jesus - that of a carpenter or builder - probably the most demanding work there is from a combined mental and physical standpoint, thus teaching all people the value of their own type of work, however hard it might be. The book contains all this, plus much, much more. But only a reading will do justice to the amazing riches of The Life and Glories of St. Joseph.	2001-03-08

In the case of &quot;The Faith of Our Fathers,&quot; both Scott Hahn and Gerry Matatics mention it by name as having personally affected their Protestant beliefs. &quot;The Faith of Our Fathers&quot; is and always has been an incredibly popular and successful book explaining the basic tenets of the Catholic faith and (more importantly) why we hold them. It delves into the historical background of virtually everything people find hard to understand about our religion, such as priestly celibacy, sacred images, the Church and the Bible, the primacy of Peter, Communion under one kind, invocation of the saints, etc. First published in 1876, during the heat of violet anti-Catholicism in the United States, the book sold 1.4 million copies in forty years and has been reprinted many times since. It will confirm one's faith in the truth of the Catholic Church like no other and will arm the reader to answer the questions so often posed by skeptics and unbelievers.	2001-03-08

During a vision of Sts. Peter and Paul, St. Dominic received the commission, &quot;Go and preach, for to this ministry thou art called,&quot; which was a prophecy regarding the order St. Dominic would found - the Order of Preachers, or the Dominicans, an order which was to attract 5,000 priests and 2,000 other clerics and lay brothers within just 35 years after the Founder's death. Drawn by a supernatural attraction, people flocked after him, eager to hear his words, and they even embraced with joy the penance he preached. The miracles and influence of St. Dominic were felt by all who knew him. He once saved 40 English pilgrims whose boat had overturned and sunk beneath the waters and were presumed gone. He raised to life a young man named Napoleon who had been horribly mangled in a fall from a horse. In his battle with the Albigensian heretics, his writings were twice submitted to the test of fire, and both times emerged unscathed. And it was in great part under St. Dominic's inspiration and through the Rosary, which he preached, that Count Simon De Montfort won the Battle of Muret with only 800 cavalry, routing an Albigensian army of 100,000; the Christians suffered a loss of just eight, while 20,000 of the enemy perished!

Groote founded the order to which Thomas A' Kempis belonged. While in the order, one of the jobs which Thomas A' Kempis was in charge of was copying the writings of their founder, because the printing press had not yet been invented. It was in doing this job that many think the confusion of authorship originates. This present work is called Groote's &quot;Spiritual Diary&quot;. It follows his life from &quot;conversion&quot; from wealth and worldliness at age 30 to the heights of spirituality. Composed of brief one-sentence gems of spiritual wisdom, this magnificent book emphasizes that crucial truth that death to self is the only way to Heaven. Throughout the entire book the author never ceases to contrast the world with the spiritual life, as black against white - the flesh and the spirit - this life and eternity. Golden nuggets of profound truth for the soul to ponder!	2001-03-08

The greatest and happiest in Heaven will be those who led the holiest lives on earth. In Heaven, no one can look upon the glorious sight of God without great joy and without becoming God-like and beautiful himself. Thus, a soul in Heaven is filled to overflowing with all knowledge; it becomes beautiful with the beauty of God, rich with His wealth, holy with His holiness, and happy with His unutterable happiness. The more completely we have mortified our inordinate passions and made our life conformable to that of Jesus Christ, the more also of personal beauty and splendor - of body as well as of soul - shall we possess in Heaven, and consequently the more of Heaven's happiness shall we enjoy. &quot;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love Him.&quot; Thus does St. Paul speak of the splendor of Heaven (1 Cor. 2:9). Further, he tells us that &quot;the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.&quot; (Rom. 8:18). And St. Teresa of Avila states that she would rather suffer all the afflictions of this world, even to the end of time, if she could thereby merit a little more glory in Heaven - that she might thereby understand a little more of the greatness of God and therefore love Him and praise Him the more. (pg. 257). The Happiness of Heaven gives us a glimpse into the secret life of Heaven and helps us to understand the greatest ambition anyone can have in this world: To rejoice eternally in the uninterrupted vision of God.

Contains one of the finest biographies of a Saint ever written, and the suspenseful story of the spread of the Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. This devotion began in Tours, France, with the revelations to a young Carmelite nun named Sr. Mary of St. Peter during the 1840's. Before it was approved by the Church in 1885, Leo Dupont practiced the devotion privately in his home, where a true likeness of Veronica's veil was perpetually venerated by a burning lamp, and before which he would pray for hours on end. Soon miracles began to occur by the application of the oil from this lamp to sick people. There were so many miracles that Pope Pius IX declared Leo Dupont to be perhaps the greatest miracle-worker in Church history. From around the world people would write to Leo Dupont for some of the oil, often addressing him simply as &quot;The Holy Man of Tours&quot; Great reading!	2001-03-08

This is a much-needed &quot;true view showing how Christendom suffered &quot;shipwreck&quot; in the Protestant Revolt against Christ and His Catholic Church. He traces the struggle, blow by blow, from the Advent of the Disaster, to the opening of the &quot;floodgates&quot; with Luther in 1517, through the &quot;English Accident&quot; and Calvin. He then shows the spiritual, military, political and financial struggles of this conflict among the French, English, Scottish, Dutch and German, describing how by 1648 the battle to keep Christendom united and in the Catholic Faith had failed of exhaustion, ending in a divided Europe, with the Protestant rebellion settling down to permanent possession of certain previously Catholic areas of Europe. No educated person can ignore this presentation of the facts of history. This is history as it happened!	2001-03-08

This inspiring work blends all the magnificent visions granted to four of the most privileged souls in the history of the Church. Raphael Brown has compiled an unforgettable masterpiece on the life of Our Lady by combining the writings from Ven. Anne Catherine Emmerich, Ven. Mary of Agreda, St. Bridget of Sweden and St. Elizabeth of Schoenau. The wonderful mental pictures obtained from this enthralling narration will so impress you that they will stay with you the rest of your life. These images can't help but enhance our understanding of the New Testament and our love for Jesus, Mary and Joseph which is why the Church allows and encourages the circulation of these writings. Perhaps just as important as the telling of Mary's life according to these famous mystics is the most valuable explanation included on how the Church deals with the contradictions on historical details that sometimes occur in writings of people who receive private revelations.	2001-03-08

Here are 100 true stories of approved miraculous statues, paintings and other images of Our Lady from all parts of the globe and spanning almost 2,000 years. Included are images that have spoken, that have brought miraculous cures and other special favors, that have helped in construction of Catholic churches, that have shed luminous rays leading to their discovery in hidden places, that have given off a celestial fragrance, been suspended in mid-air for over 5 centuries, or that have suddenly and unexplainable become extremely heavy so as to resist being moved from a favored place. Also described are images of Our Lady weeping blood and tears, of Our Lady lovingly holding the Infant Jesus, as well as the ornate and costly garments the faithful have created for these dear figures plus the special feast-days in their honor. Ranging across Italy, France, the U.S., Japan, Mexico, etc., the stories shared by Mrs. Cruz tell of the images of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Akita, Pompeii, Prompt Succor (New Orleans), Our Lady of the Smile (through which St. Therese the Little Flower was cured at age 10), Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, The Comforter of the Afflicted, The Comforter of the Afflicted, The Madonna of Consolation, Mother of Divine Love, Our Lady of Zapopan (Mexico) and many, many more!

This famous and highly respected work will be an eye-opening education for the person accustomed to the bland, factless, churchless, accepted &quot;history&quot; found in so many books today. It is a tragic depiction of the loss of millions upon millions of souls to the Catholic Faith, but very worth reading for getting the entire story straight - and all by a Protestant writer. This was written between 1824 and 1827 and has been reprinted many times by Catholic publishers because it gives the true and usually untold story of the Protestant Revolt in England during the 16th century. Even though a Protestant, the author shows that England was better when it was Catholic. For example, during Catholic times there was greater prosperity, no penury, no poor laws, almost no crime, no income tax, and a greater national military strength. Whereas, with the &quot;Reformation&quot; came the destruction of the monasteries, the driving of countless thousands of tenant farmers from the lands they had formerly rented (virtually in perpetuity and at cheap rents) from the Catholic monasteries, the creation of a vast number of homeless poor, the subsequent poor laws, income tax, a diminished military capacity, despotism by the monarchs, the Puritan Revolt, dictatorship of Cromwell, an increase of taxation, the rise of the national debt, and finally the American Revolution.

This handy one-volume edition is taken from the many volumes of the highly revered Father Alban Butler (1710-1763), an English Catholic priest and scholar, who devoted almost 30 years of meticulous research to the lives of the Saints and whose work was originally published in the 1750's. This present edition contains no debunking, as do many other editions; thus, it conveys Fr. Butler's spirit of profound faith in and reverence for our saintly traditions. Additional Saints have been added, however, who have lived since the author's time-including St. Theresa the Little Flower, Pope St. Pius X, St. Catherine Labour, etc. Based on the traditional Catholic calendar as of 1955. Gives approximately one page per saint, one or two saints per day, plus a brief Reflection based on the virtues of the saint. Extremely valuable to read daily in order to put oneself in tune with our holy Catholic traditions and to develop a truly Catholic approach to life.

Here in bold, living colors Belloc sketches the destructive results of the greed, lust, weakness, tenacity, blindness, fear and indecision of 23 famous men and women of the Protestant Reformation period, analyzing their strengths, mistakes, motives and deeds which changed the course of history. Belloc cites Anne Boleyn, not the weak-willed Henry VIII as the &quot;pivot figure&quot; of the English Reformation, for it was her iron will to be Queen which started the movement. He describes Cromwell, the monastery looter and destroyer, as &quot;the true creator of the English Reformation.&quot; He shows how the crafty William Cecil accomplished the task of &quot;digging up the Catholic Faith by the roots&quot; and &quot;crushing out the Mass from English soil.&quot; Belloc also highlights the fatal error of Cardinal Richelieu in putting France before Catholicism and thus torpedoing Europe's last great chance of keeping Christendom united. Belloc warns that this breakup of Christendom may still destroy our Christian civilization. Even those who think they do not like history will be unable to put this book down.

This book is primarily a study of Evolution, which carefully considers all basic aspects of that belief system - both &quot;Natural Evolution&quot; and Theistic Evolution.&quot; The author covers the basic question, the two basic Evolution theories, the concept of &quot;Special Creation,&quot; the discoveries of science, the fossil record, genetics, entropy (the conservation of energy, etc.) the age of the universe, pointers to a Creator, the problems with &quot;Theistic Evolution&quot; and &quot;Progressive Creation,&quot; and a number of other questions. The outcome is that there is not only no proof for Evolution, but that the proof from DNA shows that Evolution cannot occur! One of the great hallmarks of this important book is the author's discussion on the influence of Evolution on belief systems. He shows in the first part of the book that Evolution as a belief system is not only unfounded, but is contradicted at every turn by the scientific facts. AND YET Evolution forms the underlying belief structure of Nazism, Communism, Socialism, Existentialism, Humanism, and Modernism (the formally condemned heretical belief that is rife among today's Catholic clergy and hierarchy). Thus, many leading &quot;isms&quot; in todya's Church and world are based upon fundamental belief assumptions that are positively wrong! This book is pivotal for everyone today because it puts to rest once and for all the possibility for Evolution and it shows that we face the erroneous deductions and false policies of a host of deluded minds in both our Church and in our society. Not enought can be said for the impoortance of this book.<br />The author will be touring the United States in June - watch your local paper for more information.	2001-03-07

For example, the lie that the Inquisition was ruthless and unjust, that it sent thousands to merciless torture and undeserved death, and that it was administered by unbalanced and sinister minds. To settle this matter and to set forth the facts about the Inquisition, the author has drawn for us a detailed historical sketch of six prominent Inquisitors - &quot;Characters of the Inquisition,&quot; as he calls them - and in the process has explained for the modern reader the background of the Inquisition, how it operated and the major historical lines of its progress. Within these pages the reader will see history unfold before his eyes in a manner refreshingly truthful and well substantiated, and in the process, he will witness the Catholic Church being vindicated of the mendacious claims laid against her by her enemies.

The task looked hopeless, yet in four years almost all 72,000 had returned to the Catholic Faith. These little tracts show their author's great familiarity with scripture and the Fathers and Doctors of the Church; yet they come right to the point, addressing issues that are still of burning interest today--especially the question of how we can recognize the Christian church and the true Christian doctrine. Here are some of the cogent arguements against Protestantism ever penned, presenting a defense of the Catholic Faith that in some respects has never been equalled. Great!	2001-03-07

Frederick William Faber. Every catechism student should remember learning that God made us to know, to love and to serve Him. Because we cannot serve Him without first loving Him, and we cannot love Him without first knowing Him, Fr. Faber develops several extremely powerful motives for our loving God, and then offers a number of very creative ways in which we can best serve God out of love, rather than just out of duty. Fr. Faber says &quot;Nothing is easy, which we are not happy about while we are doing.&quot; He then shows how to make the service of God easy by doing all for love of God. &quot;I want to beguile you into serving Jesus out of love,&quot; says Fr. Faber, &quot;for everything comes easy to love.&quot; One of this famous convert/priest's greatest books written precisely to help us save our souls by doing ALL for God out of love for God - which is by far the easiest way of salvation! Comprehensive inspirational insights! 308pp. PB. Imprimatur.	2001-03-07

At an age naturally given to questioning the values they have been raised with, college students are often all too open to seemingly rational assaults on the Faith. In this book, former John Carroll University Professor Fr. Alexander presents air-tight, rational arguments for Catholicism in a manner sure to appeal to any university or upper level High School student sincerely interested in finding out the truth about God, the Universe, and his or her self. Starting with the existence of God, Fr. Alexander continues by showing that God founded a specific religion, that that religion is the one called Catholic, and that everyone has an obligation to join the Catholic religion. This book is essential armor for any intelligent young Catholic going off to a university, or whose Faith is threatened in High School. It is also good for non-Catholic college students making inquiry about ultimate truths. Ideal for Godparents and everyone who wants to explain the Faith to others. Ironclad logic!	2001-03-07

Hosts which have become hard as stone upon being received by a person in mortal sin, Hosts which have levitated or manifested their hidden presence by mysterious lights, etc. Covering a period from Lanciano, Italy (8th century) to Stich, Bavaria (1970), many of these miracles came about after sacrilege had been committed against the Holy Eucharist. Gives information on official investigations made into these events and tells where these miraculous Hosts can be seen and adored. Also describes the extraordinary Eucharistic phenomena in the lives of many saints: saints who lived on the Eucharist alone, raptures and ecstasies during Holy Communion, miraculous receptions, levitation, visions, locutions, and phenomena of tears, fire and light - plus the history of Eucharistic adoration, including Benediction, Corpus Christi, and perpetual adoration. A powerful shot in the arm to the sagging faith of Catholics today. Firmly buttresses the loftiest mystery of the Catholic religion.	2001-03-07

She foretold that this inspired writing would be forgotten for a time, but then would come to light again. The author (Fr. Croiset) was the spiritual director of St. Margaret Mary and therefore was intimately familiar with every aspect of the revelations given by Our Lord to this famous saint; thus, the book is actually the &quot;key&quot; to understanding the importance and the centrality of the Sacred Heart devotion for our lives as true Catholics. This great work was actually commissioned by Our Lord Himself through St. Margaret Mary, and as Father Croiset neared completion of it, St. Margaret told him that Our Lord said it was so completely in accord with His wishes that it would never be necessary to make any change in it. Later she revealed that it was Our Lord Himself who had inspired him with the ideas in this book and that it was so pleasing to Him that &quot;none other but Himself could have arranged everything so much to His wishes.&quot; This magnificent work is a revelation to all just why so few of us become great saints and why so few, despite going frequently to the Sacraments, fail really to grow in the life of grace and make great progress in the spiritual order.

The task looked hopeless, yet in four years almost all 72,000 had returned to the Catholic Faith. These little tracts show their author's great familiarity with scripture and the Fathers and Doctors of the Church; yet they come right to the point, addressing issues that are still of burning interest today--especially the question of how we can recognize the Christian church and the true Christian doctrine. Here are some of the cogent arguements against Protestantism ever penned, presenting a defense of the Catholic Faith that in some respects has never been equalled. Great!	2001-03-07

Faber's key book, which stands at the &quot;source and origin&quot; of all his others, for it contains the fundamental insight which leads to a proper understanding about all other aspects of our religion. Says men in the modern era accept God's existence, but deny His sovereignty in practice, and he explores the ramifications of this. Though composed in mid-19th century, this book is absolutely on target today, for man's tendency to arrogate to himself the prerogatives of God - strong in Fr. Faber's time - is epidemic today and cannot but influence Catholics. This book is a powerful awakener!	2001-03-07

But where to begin the study of nearly 2,000 years? Probably no book was better concieved or better executed to fulfill this need than Church History by Fr.John Laux. Written expressly both for students and adults; anyone who becomes familar with this book will find that he has aquired an excellent background in Church history. The author intersperses the history with many brief, interesting biographies of famous people, and at the end of each chapter, he quotes briefly from a famous writing of the era, blending a medly of elements into a comprehensive historical composition that is at once brilliant and fascinating. Church History by Fr. Laux is a story of the Church unparalled in its scope, depth, variety, interest, and impact, and a book all Catholics should read, that they might understand in what manner the &quot;mustard seed&quot; planted by Our Lord has grown to be the greatest institution in the entire world!	2001-03-07

Catholicism built the Western World - from Roman times through the Dark Ages to the High Middle Ages - but the false doctrine and social philosophy of Protestantism, based on Calvin, is causing a steady and continuing breakdown of that world. Belloc shows the Reformation's evil results in the economic sphere, through the dissolving of Catholic restraints on usury and on unbridled competition. He states that &quot;Calvin opened the door to the domination of the mind by money.&quot; Belloc concludes that the return of Catholicism is the only remedy for our crumbling world, because our basic principles of civilization are Catholic in origin and only by being energized and guided by the Faith will they - and our civilization - continue to be what they are and continue to help poor, fallen mankind in this world. Belloc maintains that we are drifting back towards slavery and only by re-embracing Catholicism will disaster be averted.	2001-03-07
