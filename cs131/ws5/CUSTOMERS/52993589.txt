Anyway, I purchased this book. I followed the book up till page 10. The exercise was to juggle just two balls. That's it. So for a minute or two almost every day, I practiced juggling 2 balls, which was surprisingly difficult. It's all about the toss, about timing, and about being patient and not panicking. Eventually, I got pretty decent and consistent. Today, around 10 days after receiving the book and balls, I decided to try the third ball. Didn't even bother to look at the book. And within a few tries, I was tossing all three balls around! No kidding. It was harder learning to toss the two balls than it was to incorporate the third ball.     I am a coordinated middle-aged Baby Boomer, so if you're in that category or younger, I dare you to give this a try.    I don't know if my experience is typical, but I would recommend to anyone that they focus on juggling just two balls for a while. It might be the most difficult part.    The book (at least the first 10 pages) was excellent. I will look into whatever the book has to offer after I get better at the juggling I have managed so far.	2004-12-31

Following Marshall's formula, you will end up writing a Lifetime movie script. <br /> <br />I don't much care for the kind of novels Marshall would have you write.	2004-11-28

Instructions as long as sixteen lines long contains several steps, yet they're not numbered. What were the authors thinking? Have they not used instructional materials before? Obviously, they're new to writing them.    I have also also had the worst time trying to find the examples. I open up the Chapter 14 tutorial and get an After Effects warning: \\"23 files are missing since you last saved this project\\". Interesting, since I'd never opened the project. And then the tutorial doesn't work because the graphics are missing.    This book gets two stars for reference, but no stars for execution. The lack of numbered steps is totally unforgiveable (I thought this would be a training manual) and the disk with the missing files is unforgivable. I've yet to find a website for file download.    Buy whatever copy of the book everyone else has because mine (2nd Edition, Version 5.5) is awful.	2004-10-03

With few words, with a seemingly simplistic point of view, complicated matters that go beyond the borders of Botswana are broken down into small parcels. The facts have life are not often so basically described.<br />One of the main aspects of the novel that I really love is the unpredictable pacing of the novel. Halfway through the story, a new and very important story line surfaces and without a lot of Hollywood-style drama, the story continues unfolding calmly, without exploding cars; wild, passionate scenes; predictable melodrama. Unlike most stories today, the plot doesn't build up to a dramatic plateau three quarters of the way through the story; rather it unfolds like rolling hills.<br />The plot is almost inconsequential compared to the telling of the story; it's the telling of the story and the point of views that make these books so captivating. This series successfully transports you to a new world and way of looking at life, something that can't be said for most fiction that I have read.<br />Between this book and Matt Lauer's report on Botswana, I am now looking forward to visiting this country someday.	2004-03-23

Who'd've thunk that there were more twists and turns to come?<br />I hadn't been reading much lately and decided to delve into shallow waters. I did so with First to Die. James Patterson must've spent a couple of days watching Lifetime movies to learn how to write about women. The sisterhood angle was dated and pretty silly. Maybe in the eighties that would've flown. But now it's just silly, stating-the-obvious crap that women don't talk about much because it's understood. And all the hugging and \\"we love yous\\" between near-strangers made my eyes roll again and again. The sex scenes were totally unnecessary and silly. Too much detail. [...] Give me a break!! Read like something that I might've been entertained by when I was in my teens. Early teens. And just as I wonder in just about every movie directed by a man, I wondered, \\"what's the attraction here?\\" in this book in which lust instantly becomes love. What tripe!<br />Because I managed to get through the book, I will give Patterson one more shot. But after that...	2004-03-22

I don't understand why people think that one must re-tell the story to express an opinion. If I had read some of these reviews before I purchased the book, I never would have purchased it. But I guess that's just me. I pick up a book and expect to read a story I don't already know.<br />I enjoyed the novel in the beginning, but as the story progressed, it not only became a bit absurd, it became transparent. The end was absolutely no surprise; I saw it coming very early on.<br />The characters are pretty flimsy and often cartoonish, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but compounded with a predictable ending you get the formula for a silly romp. Not my cup of tea but I applaud Grisham's change of pace and the subject matter.	2004-01-08

That's because my only incentive to return to the book was to complete it. <br />The setting is as desolate as the plot and characters. The plot is a series of back-and-forths between Kinsey's hotel room and the location of her next interview, with a too-frequent reference to a fast-food detour in between for humor (and this attempt at levity missed the mark by the third or fourth mention).<br />Reading this book reminded me of returning to jogging after a long stretch off: it was dull and arduous and I wanted to cut it short after every 50 steps or so and in the end, I was just satisfied that I finally finished.	2003-12-29

But to be in her 60s in present-day America, she was pretty annoying. She seemed much older than my grandmother, who is in her 90s and living in the Deep South. I'm sure my grandmother would find Miss Julia pretty gullible and judgmental and waaaay behind the times. And very slow on the uptake. Things that were clear to me at the very beginning didn't quite come to her for many, many pages later.<br />Not a bad read, but I was very impatient to finish the book and forget about this backwards, overly-prim woman.	2003-09-05

Perhaps I'm qualified to be a police chief of a town on the southern Florida coast.<br />When someone has obviously bugged my phone, I use it to coordinate strategy with the FBI during a crisis. When someone is obviously trying to kill me, I post a lone cop outside my home to protect me. Call me paranoid, but I'm not feeling secure. Certainly, when my Doberman, who is used to frolicking in the dunes alone, will not enjoy my company when she needs to relieve herself during a time that someone is trying to kill me. But Holly, she's a different breed of law enforcer. She takes the dog for a walk. Uh-huh. <br />Someone who has bugged my phones is obviously incapable of knowing who I'm sleeping with, so when I'm on the lam, it would never occur to them that I'm at his home, which is just down the beach from my own home. It always helps to have enemies who are dumb as rocks. So dumb that I continue to commute to and from work each day and they have know clue where I'm currently living.<br />Here's a gem. Page 200 of the paperback. \\"Harry, do you ever have the feeling that this business is bigger than...\\"<br />To which Harry, the ever-sharp FBI man responds, \\"No.\\"<br />Nothing like a Fed who can envision the possibilities.<br />I assumed who the bad guy was at the beginning of the book. Hmm...Maybe I should give some thought to being a novelist. I'm obviously qualified. At least I wouldn't waste space with countless conversations that begin with, \\"Holly Barker\\". Even an amateur knows a better way to get to the point than detail every trivial bit of conversation.

Perhaps some coastal city off Florida will appoint me police chief. I'm obviously very qualified.<br />So someone's been bugging your telephones. Several chapters later, in a crisis, you pick it up to call your extremely inept FBI contact to discuss strategy.<br />And you're staking out an Explorer in front of a building. The person you are surveiling has gone inside. Sometime later, you see the Explorer moving, but you never saw anyone get inside it. So when you coordinate with the FBI to relieve you from your tailing duties, you direct both cars to the Explorer. Call me suspicious, but I would've instructed one to stake out the building.<br />Okay, someone's trying to kill you. You hide out down the beach from your home (anyone who's been trying to kill you and has been in your home a couple times would not have figured out who you're sleeping with). And go out to walk your dog. Isn't that clever? Call the SPCA on me. Or even Animal Control. But if I had a dog who was accustomed to frolicking on the beach without me, that's exactly what she would be doing if someone were trying to kill me. Oh yeah. During this time you're on the lam, you continue to go to work and commute to your hideout, which is being watched by a single cop. Dock my pay. I'm not going to work. Call me paranoid, too.<br />How many times must the reader endure a telephone conversation that starts with \\"Holly Barker\\"? Does the author get paid by the word? Here's some useful verbiage following a waiter delivering a bowl of lobster bisque to Holly's table. \\"This is wonderful,\\" Holly said, tasting it. How could I possibly understand the context of her comment without the last two words?<br />A conversation with the inept FBI guy. Holly and he are talking about the twist and turns of the case (Page 200, paperback):<br />Holly:  ...do you ever have the feeling that this business is bigger than....<BR>FBI guy: No.<br />That's what I like, a law officer who considers the possibilities.<br/>The dialogue throughout the action-packed ending (provided you haven't watched TV since the 1960s) seemed to come out of \\"Moonlighting\\" (at least that was the 1980s).<br />Hey, maybe I should write books for a living, I'm sure I'm qualified.	2003-08-05

But if you're beginning and have no previous programming experience, this book quickly loses you. You spend way too much time being bogged down in the details of datatypes and operators, and you find yourself wondering, &quot;What will I ever use this for?&quot;.

I'd read half of each novel. So when I got to this one, my expectations were pretty low.<br />This was definitely a page-turner. I thought I was going to be extremely disappointed when I saw that Barrington character turn up. Especially with Woods' occasional references to Holly's wondering if she'd every sleep with someone again. I was braced for her being Barrington's latest conquest. Fortunately, that didn't happen.<br />So there you see my low expectations. Desperation to finish a book I read and dread that Holly would be the next woman to fall all over herself over Barrington. <br />Thus, as I've stated, the book was a page-turner. Some criticize Woods' dismissal of Holly's grief; I was grateful that the plot moved on with minimal wallowing. There was a case to solve and Holly had to put her feelings aside.<br />Okay, it was  a far-fetched case and all that, but it was like watching network TV when you're too tired to do anything useful. It passed the time.<br />The best part of the book, though, was the author's notes at the end. Pretty humorous. &quot;Write me only if you're going to praise me otherwise don't bother.&quot; I like the guy's nerve. This is the type person who would make Barrington his protagonist. Kind of immersed in his own fantasy.	2003-01-22

I sent multiple e-mails, one which points out something I'm SURE is an error (and it took me a very long time trying to figure it out) and nothing was done. I had another problem with script I'd typed. I checked over and over to make sure I'd gotten the syntax correct, and I had. Then I cut and pasted the FOE coding that I'd downloaded, and guess what? It didn't work either! But when I looked at the rest of the .FLA I saw that the FOE people used different settings than they used in the book. Seems someone decided that some variables needed some tweaks but failed to put it either in the book or on the errata page. I even postponed reviewing this book so that I could give the FOE people a chance to rectify their goofs. But they didn't.<br />This book is chatty, but chatty doesn't equate to good instruction. If you want to learn Actionscript and know nothing about it or Javascript already, you're out of luck. <br />I believe that previous viewers might've written so positively because they didn't follow the book step-by-step as I did.

I got to page 192 and was still wondering if a mystery would ever surface. One finally did, afterwards.<br />This is a book about a bunch of people talking about an incident from 25 years ago, one that was significant to them, but totally uninteresting to me. And the incident was described repeatedly. A bunch of people get drunk and 25 years ago someone dies. But even at the outset of the book, no one seemed at all curious about the death. So why should the reader? Fast forward to the last fourth of the book and someone else dies. Now things heat up. Well, sort of. <br />The reader is taken through a bunch of conversations full of false statements and minute details about an uninteresting death and...<br />Dull. Very dull. I anticipated liking this series that I bought the next book.

Beth Sherman's shore mysteries have some darkness and moodiness in them and I guess that's a nice change from other main characters.<br />I guess because Hardaway is such a serious character, I tend to forget that she has been involved in other murders. She seems like a real, everyday character, not a Jessica Fletcher who attracts murders like a trailer park attracts tornados. And she doesn't come off as a particularly snoopy type, either. It is this ease with which I find each mystery believable, I guess, that makes me like the Jersey Shore mysteries.<br />This one was no exception. Though the author seems to have reconstructed Anne Hardaway from a once very solitary character with an empty, isolated childhood to one who was raised with a handful cousins that she was very close to, and more aunts than you can shake a stick at, I was glad for the makeover. The previous Hardaway seemed to have wallowed a bit too much in her mother's illness to the point where you wondered how she could have any lasting relationships at all because she didn't seem to have any growing up.<br />Anyway, like the previous Hardaway mysteries, this one was fun to read and I would recommend it to anyone.	2002-06-17

Or that I'm the other \\"none friend of Susan Mc Bride\\" who has written a review.<br />I applaud Mc Bride's first effort, I really do.<br />My first problem with the book came right away when the mother of the missing child is talking to her best friend. Suddenly, she realizes her child is missing. And through the description that follows as the mother frantically searches for her child, her best friend is nowhere to be found. I re-read the paragraphs to see if there had been an exit I missed. But there wasn't. I'm sorry, when I read a blow-by-blow, I expect details.<br />I must have no heart because there was nothing particularly riveting about the story. It was flat and reading it, I was reminded of a child telling a story \\"and then, and then, and then\\". Not nearly as gut wrenching as it should be. Telling me that someone wakes up sweating and feeling a tightness in her chest and feeling nauseated has been done again and again and again. How about a new way to describe someone's personal terror than one that has been overplayed? All we needed was that sound of the heartbeat thumping. I was always told, \\"don't tell, show\\", but I felt I was told more than shown as cliched references to waking up in terror does little to make me feel what I'm sure the author wanted me to feel. I rolled my eyes a lot instead. A previous reference to Lifetime movies hit the mark.<br />Also, it was difficult for me to be patient with a book that made me wait from page 102 when I knew whodunnit till page 222 when the detective did. No surprises whatsoever. Just a bunch of transparent red herrings. And perhaps a few too many of them as well. When you have that many suspicious characters, you just look for the only non-suspicious one.<br />And why a publisher would allow a line break up at a contraction, escapes me. That was pretty amateurish.<br />All that said, I would try Mc Bride's next book. Everyone has to start somewhere (I haven't even gotten as far as Mc Bride, getting published and all) and I'm sure she will improve with experience.	2002-06-17

(Yesterday I heard some guy spouting off angrily about comments made by Morgan Freeman...Freeman's an actor, not a policy maker or civic leader, why get all worked up over his opinions?) And they can't seem to make a point without throwing out the word &quot;liberal&quot; or the name &quot;Kennedy&quot;. So it was fun to read Moore's book, which went completely in the other direction, while still acknowledging the flaws of the Clinton administration.<br />The book was a refreshing, irreverent look at modern politics, and an amusing way for me to see how left wing I'm not (it's all a matter of degree).	2002-06-05
US	52993589	RAK6QIW4U0KVK	0385503822	782272714	The Summons	Books	1	7	7	N	N	Anemic Plot	I'm trying to judge this book as just another novel, not a John Grisham Book. That said, this book was still disappointing. The plot was thin and uninteresting, the characters pretty character-less. It read like a short story that was stretched into a novel. A single story line, no twists, no tension, minimal character development. These same flaws also made the book read like someone's first novel. <br />Asides: 1) I enjoyed Grisham's choices of surnames, wondering what he would come up with next (Atlee, Mirk, Magargel, Crum, Meave). 2) I hope Grisham's editor will learn which verb to use with the word &quot;none&quot;. And 3) John, as hot as the Drifters were in the early 60s, you will not find their songs on any Motown albums!<br />I hope this book is just an anomaly and not the beginning of a bottoming out (a la Cornwell).	2002-06-05

First, the exercises were short ones so I could walk away from the computer and come back and not be lost. Second, I found very few errors in the book, and the ones I did find were non- tutorial-affecting. I've taken far too many tutorials in which the files weren't available on the CD or the lesson didn't work as described or there were glaring grammatical or spelling errors throughout.<br />I liked this book a lot because it didn't spend as much time on the graphics aspect of Flash as other books do (and then they spend too little time on the animation aspect). I've dinked around with the program before. Now I feel I have a sound background in the program. This is one of the few tutorials I have ever completed; it's the first Flash one I have. The projects held my interest and showed me things about the program that I hadn't yet discovered.<br />I recommend this book to any beginner and anyone who has played around with the program but doesn't have a good grasp on its capabilities.	2001-10-23

It's not as simple and as easy to figure out as the last one I read (in which there were only two possible suspects). Nevertheless, the plot was still a bit simple for my tastes. I assumed that there would be two killers and grew a bit bored waiting for the two main characters to consider this possibility. I find it hard to believe that after his dealings with Mrs. Brandt, Malloy is still so shocked at her honesty and directness. His prim and proper reactions wear thin.    As I said, this is a much-improved story and I would definitely try another Gaslight Mystery.	2001-07-22

Then I had to rack my brains to recall what the book was about. That should tell you something.<br />The author's writing is lively and witty but the plot was weak and forgettable.

I enjoyed this book for its description of the times and of New York City, and the contentious relationshiop between Sarah Brandt and Frank Malloy. But I was extremely disappointed by the &quot;mystery&quot;. I'm one who  never figures out whodunits, but this one was painfully  obvious. <br />The  suspect list was anemic, and I couldn't believe that the protagonist hadn't  a clue. I figured out one guilty party and waited 134 painful pages for her  to get her first clue, and then was relieved to see that there were only 66  pages left for her to get the second clue. As I stated, I'm lousy at  figuring out whodunits, but if memory serves, even Carolyn Keene was better  at disguising the bad guys. Perhaps Thompson could learn a thing or two  reading Nancy Drew.<br />I hope Thompson doesn't continue to ruin an  interesting series with such a skimpy plot. She was obnoxiously  heavy-handed with her clues, which made Sarah Brandt seem all the more  incompetent. Also, Thompson has  fallen into the trap of placing the  protagonist in violent struggles with the bad guy(s), which is neither  exciting nor surprising. Just cliche.<br />I hope the next installment won't  be as frustrating as this one.	2000-07-31

On tape, the tale is streamlined down to the basic necessities of the plot and  things move quickly and keep me interested.<br />I found the development of  Nate O'Reilly's character to be interesting and though I'm no holy-roller  myself, I was happy for his transformation in the end and, like him, I was  in awe of Rachel.<br />As always, Grisham delivers a satisfying ending. The  bad guys don't always get harsh punishment (but they don't walk away  ecstatic, either) and the good guys don't have everything happen exactly as  they would have liked (but they are content).	2000-06-18

While I didn't find this book to be as historically detailed as Monfredo's, I did find the  plot a bit more compelling, and I enjoyed the two protagonists and the slow  unveiling of their backgrounds and personalities.<br />The story line never  seemed to stall; I stayed with the plot throughout and never found my mind  wandering. My only gripe would be the last 20 pages or so. I was surprised  that the two detectives didn't leap to the same conclusions that I already  had; I thought the details of the crime were quite clear much earlier than  they did. As well, as soon as the culprits shifted to their final location,  I knew exactly what was going to happen next and thought the story became  too melodramatic, too 19th-century novel-ish. <br />I look forward to reading  Thompson's next book, which I've already purchased.	2000-06-04

Initially, I was amused by the premise, by Bridget's daily summaries of her calorie intake, units of alcohol, and number of  cigarettes.

When the end came, I was disappointed because Grisham's usually pretty good  about giving people their comeuppance, but when I thought about it, just  about none of the parties involved were innocent and despite their seeming  to have gotten what the wanted, I think they all sacrificed a lot, even  Maynard, who conquered all but was in ill health and miserable. So, on  second thought, I thought the ending was all right after all.<br />I've a  feeling that if I'd read this book, I would have given in only 3 stars, but  as a book-on-tape, it was an ear-perker.	2000-04-24

Also, I found talk of Viet Nam deaths with  this particular graduating class a bit distracting seeing that the war was  over before these people graduated.

The fact that the mystery writer practically steps on someone near the scene of the crime who was outrageously attired and doesn't make the connection later was irritating.  The humor was pretty good as was the way the author moved the story along  (at least towards the end of the book). I found it unreal that an  attractive woman like the protagonist seemed to view dating with the  jitters of a woman who had just ended a 20-year marriage. Geez, she was  only twenty-nine years old, surely she'd gone out a few times since high  school!	1999-11-18

I could handle unbelievable and clever, but unbelievable and boring and  juvenile is a whole 'nother thing. The plot twisted and turned and  basically led to nowhere of interest and there were so many  characters--thrown in to add to the twists and turns--but really just  mucking up the storyline, which was weak to begin with.<br />I can't think of  a book that I've read in my adult years that was more stupid than this one.  If it were a movie, it would be in a dead heat with The Three Amigos, which  I walked out on. If it were a TV show, it would be a dumbed down version of  the Wild, Wild West, transformed into a Saturday morning cartoon.	1999-11-08

It was distracting and ruined the flow of many, many sentences. Often, I had to re-read sentences to try to understand the meaning behind them. &quot;My ex-husband nodded approvingly  at Sam, forgetting what a bad guy he was, himself.&quot; &quot;He says he  thinks Ken was running drug packages over the border from Canada, in his  boat.&quot; &quot;...that anybody's going to...make you do any complicated  brain surgery, tonight.&quot; Graves' use of the comma is excessive and  extremely distracting and annoying. I only write this in hopes that the  author will take note and insist on (or get) a better editor.<br />Now, to the  compliments. I usually find mysteries a bit dull because the authors  concentrate on the story line and pay little attention to character  development and decent dialogue. Not so with Graves. It's entertaining to  read about two rather bumbling sleuths and not the hard-boiled detective   or the far-too-perceptive-to-be-believable rookie. The interplay between  Jacobia and Ellie was refreshing. Sometimes Jacobia didn't have a clue and  Ellie had to paint a picture for her; other times Jacobia added one plus  one on her own and came up with two.<br />Graves uses a technique that until  now, I hadn't noticed that I haven't seen much in recent years in my  reading (particularly mysteries): the tickler last sentence of a chapter  that made you decide to read on although you'd planned to stop for a while.  That ploy seems to be a lost art.<br />I have since picked up Graves' first  book, The Dead Cat Bounce, and look forward to her next one.	1999-07-26

I'd grown accustomed to Glynis Tryon (who would be approximately 45 years old now) and wasn't quite ready to turn over the reins of sleuthing to some snot-nosed niece. <br /> Monfredo made the transition easier for me by creating a book whose mystery was more compelling than the mysteries of the previous Tryon series. With the other books, I was much more caught up on the historical side of the story and gaining insight into what it was like to live during those times than in the mystery. The Stalking Horse, however, had a more involved plot and more tension and action than the other books, and this Tryon was involved in events that could have changed the course of history. Plus, I still got my dose of historical insight. And I have to admit, hanging off the edge of moving railroad cars is not something I think 45-year old Glynis would be likely to do. <br /> I appreciated Monfredo's Historical Notes and her suggestions that we would be seeing a couple more of the historical figures in future stories. I hope the future also includes Jacques Sundown and Glynis as well.	1998-03-25

I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time until I got to the part where Tempe Brennan interpreted the information in layman's terms. I thought the character development was shallow; I people prefer fleshed-out characters, I guess, not flat ones who seem to have hardly any pasts and little depth. Finally, what I found as irritating as the excessive technical jargon was all the French. A &quot;oui&quot; here and there would indicate that the character was of French descent (not that I cared); I didn't want the French lesson.

I often times felt very sorry for Eva's lot in life, but then I would recall that Eva certainly didn't feel sorry for herself, and she would probably tell me off for being so sappy. I thoroughly enjoyed Eva's perspective of life and her way with words. It's been a while since I met such a colorful character.  <br /> As I stated, I have a problem with the &quot;mystery&quot; categorization. I was reminded more of &quot;The Book of Ruth&quot; and &quot;Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man&quot; than any mystery I've ever read. I was more caught up in Eva's affording to fix her teeth and winning her wrestling match than her fairly passive quest for her sister and her attempt to get herself out of her latest fix.  I look forward to reading the next installment. I applaud Eva Cody's rich character.	1998-03-20

Then, after the second death in the book, I had the &quot;mystery&quot; figured out and couldn't wait for the plot to unravel (I hate quitting). I found Mr. Martini's knowledge of the Virgin Islands most distracting. First, St. Martin is not a Virgin Island. Second, there was much description of the need for passports to travel to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  Third, one character who was a police officer in St. Croix made an observation about &quot;Americans&quot;. Does Mr. Martini know nothing about the United States and its territories? By the time I got to the last fifty pages of the book, I was put off by the dramatics and the heroics and the damsel in distress stuff and I felt that I was reading a Sidney Sheldon novel.	1997-12-29

A simple arrest that would have happened whether or not she was at the scene. <BR> <BR> The more I read Cornwell, the more I realize that, except for Marino, her characters have no substance. It's becoming more noticeable now because the plots are getting less interesting. Most of Cornwell's details pertaining to Scarpetta are about whatever food or wine she is drinking. Lucy has improved, at last. She is less petulant and moody than usual. Wesley is just as personality-less as Kay (what is the attraction between them, dullness?). <BR> <BR> I think I would find Cornwell's books more interesting if she kept Kay at the local level with only minimal dealings with the FBI. I'm sure she'd have plenty to keep her busy in Virginia instead of traipsing all over the country and interfacing with a zillion government agencies (with their zillion acronyms and abbreviations). Making her a government agent does not add to the interest of the books. It's the medical examiner work that has made the books interesting. She's at her best in her lab, not hopping military planes. <BR> <BR> I'm annoyed by the serial aspect of the book. Yes, characters do grow and I like seeing that happen, but must we re-visit criminals (especially when it's merely a teaser for upcoming books and has no relevance to the current plot) as well? <BR> <BR> I wish Cornwell would take a break from Scarpetta and not try so hard to crank out one book per year. It's apparently too much of a strain on her creativity, and I don't mean that unkindly.	1997-09-28

I also got a chuckle at how incredibly moronic most of the men were in the book. That kind of thing is fun once in a while. I felt that PC's main characters had much more dimension than Kay Scarpetta. Kay's bland. Mostly, she's just reacting to situations. Hammer and West were more fleshed out, and I enjoyed that	1997-07-07

Scarpetta seems to have become an action-adventure character. I liked her better when she was just a medical examiner for the city of Richmond and not a pseudo FBI agent. The story line of Lucy's heroics as T.H.E. FBI girl-wonder of computers is far-fetched and getting tiresome. Let's get out of the FBI biz and dump Benton, please! Marino's great and the complex relationship with Lucy is fine. But the hands-on crime fighting is just getting downright stupid. I thought the story began well enough, but once Kay and Lucy donned their masks and capes and headed for the Batmobile, I became bored. The ending was rushed, but to be honest, considering my boredom at that point, not rushed enough	1997-07-06
