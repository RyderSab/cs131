Right?  That is basically Ezzo's philosophy.  Put your child on a feeding schedule and ignore her cries in-between feedings so that she will learn not to cry.  Just because it works doesn't make it the right way to raise a child.<br />Thankfully, most parents who read this book modify Ezzo's instruction in some way.  But my recommendation is that you stay away from it altogether.<br />Please, please, please educate yourself regarding Ezzo and his writing.  There are many strong concerns about this man's character and his teaching.  Here are just a few:<br />* He has refused to allow other professionals to review the independent studies he claims to have undertaken<br />* The American Academy of Pediatricians has linked his advice to numerous incidents of dehydration in infants<br />* He has been excommunicated from two southern California churches, both of which have noted that he claimed to have college degrees that he does not have, among many other problems<br />AT THE HEART OF GARY EZZO'S METHOD IS A FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIAN INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE THAT SAYS THAT KIDS ARE BORN BAD, BORN TRYING TO MANIPULATE AND DECEIVE PARENTS.  This is the version of the material for nonChristians, so you won't find that assumption stated in this book.  But that goofy and wrong assumption forms the basis of his teaching.<br />For more info, check out [...]	2004-03-04

Wright writes well in a technical/scholarly style and in a devotional style.  This book is a collection of devotional/meditational reflections concerning Christ's glory.  Interestingly, it starts with reflections on suffering.  Suffering is formative in Christ's glorification.  It, thus, is formative for ours.  Wow, is that something I need to be reminded of!<br />Wright, whom I believe is more of a Pauline scholar than a gospels scholar, has injected new life into modern views of Jesus and Paul.  Yet his works are firmly grounded in orthodox church doctrine.  All of his writing is steeped in meditation and prayer, not merely research.  He strives to apply the story of Scripture (the gospel) to our place and time in history.  As such, his works, both scholarly and devotional, are accessible, relevant, enjoyable, and powerful.  I highly recommend his writing.<br />I'm using this book as a series of Lenten reflections.  But it is appropriate for devotional reading anytime during the year.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-25

BSc as Kaplan and Norton conceived of it was focused on measurement, specifically measuring variables that had some linkage to corporate financial results so that the direction of the organization could be determined prior to the occurrence of a bad quarter or two.  THE MEASURES OF ANY MANAGEMENT CONCEPT ARE ITS ADOPTION AND ITS STAYING POWER, AND KAPLAN AND NORTON'S BSc IS AN OVERWHELMING SUCCESS.<br />BUT companies that enacted BSc's started to tie them to corporate strategies, making them strategic management tools and not just measurement tools.  One of the advancements was to tie define measures that measured the success of strategic intent as defined by specific objectives and goals.  Another was to create cause and effect maps of the objectives, called &quot;strategy maps.&quot;<br />Measurement is, of course, still an important part of the BSc, but the process of determining what to measure begins higher up the strategic ladder.  KAPLAN AND NORTON THEMSELVES CHRONICLE THE GROWTH OF BSc INTO A STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT TOOL IN THEIR SUBSEQUENT WORK.<br />So, this book is a bit outdated, though it is still a useful introduction.  However, I recommend that you try:<br />* Strategy Maps: Converting Intangible Assets into Tangible Outcomes by Kaplan and Norton<br />* The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment, also by Kaplan and Norton<br />* Balanced Scorecard Step-by-Step: Maximizing Performance and Maintaining Results by Paul R. Niven<br />And a good introductory article to the idea of strategy mapping is &quot;Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System&quot;, a Harvard Business Review article by Kaplan and Norton that is also available on Amazon.	2004-01-21

Too often complex mathematics are an egotistic tool of the economist that merely frustrates the reader.  Champ and Freeman's Modeling Monetary Economies is a wonderful volume that explains tough issues in monetary economics by building upon Wallace and Bryant's overlapping generations (OLG) model.<br />The OLG framework is a very simple framework that has its limitations, yet it is a powerful explanatory device.  Champ and Freeman apply it to the following exercises:<br />* Introduce money into an economy--any grad student of economics (as I once was) will tell you this is no simple task!  We take money for granted, of course, but mathematical models tend to imply that money is unnecessary!  Just getting money into an economic model without unreasonable assumptions is itself an accomplishment.<br />* Inflation--again, not easy to do in other mathematical models of money--and anticipated inflation<br />* International currency exchange and the indeterminancy of the exchange rate<br />* Central banking and changes to the money supply<br />* Banks and lending<br />* Deficits and the national debt<br />* The interaction of all of the above<br />The book also has exercises in it that apply and extend the models introduced in each chapter.<br />RECOMMENDATION<br />I recommend this book for advanced year undergrads (in mathematical econ programs) and graduate students.  It really is a great book that builds a conceptual knowledge of the interaction of the various components of monetary economics.  This is useful for understanding more complicated dynamic optimization models.  And it provides models that are useful in their own right and relevant as the basis for further (ie., dissertation) research.	2004-01-20

Mishkin's text was hands-down the best text.  But there weren't a lot of alternatives to choose from.  This text gets used in a lot of MBA programs.<br />The thing I liked most about this text was its comprehensiveness.  Mishkin did a far better job than the other text of introducing stock options.  And of course, he covered the banking (money multiplier, bnak loans, etc.) side comprehensively.  Good job with exchange rates, too.<br />Weaknesses: Need more on the insurance industry, particularly with the biggest banks now firmly in that business.  Need more on financial futures.  And finally, I'd like to see a little more mathematical rigor.  I supplemented the text in an undergrad class with some more mathematical articles from the economics literature.	2004-01-18

Two of the prominent books that I am familiar with are:<br />* Thomas Sargent's Dynamic Macroeconomics<br />* Lucas and Stokey's Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics<br />(Note: I see that Sargent has another volume out, Recursive Macroeconomic Theory, with Lars Ljungqvist.)<br />Chow's book presents a Lagrangian method for dynamic optimization.  This is a far easier approach than recursive methods, as anyone who is familiar with simple calculus will attest.  Chow presents the method then --and this is the real value of this book-- systematically applies it to familiar market equilibrium, financial, business cycle, game theory, and growth models (all dynamic, of course).<br />BENEFITS:<br />* Chow's Lagrangian method removes mathematical obstacles to understanding important macroeconomic models<br />* Chow is a good writer, and this book is far easier to understand than the two books listed above<br />* This is a great reference for grad students looking for foundations for your own research	2004-01-18

Because of personal connections, he was able to get closer to the statue than the general public.  He took 1000's of pictures from every conceivable angle, in all types of lighting, using color and black and white film.  This selection of those photographs was originally published in 1973 and has sold about 100,000 copies world-wide.<br />I FOUND THE PICTURE QUALITY TO BE WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE.  The pictures in the book are very poorly lit.  I would hope that is because of the printing technology that existed in 1973, but a lot of the photographs exhibit very poor lighting decisions, too.  Specifically, there is a lot of glare and reflection in many of the images.<br />Yes, I know, he is taking pictures on white marble--how could there not be glare?  But any seasoned photographer could set up lighting that would reduce the glare if not eliminate it altogether.  SADLY, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE.	2004-01-10

This is tabloid journalism.  It is the largely unsubstantiated accusations of someone who clearly didn't like the Clintons.<br />The whole account of Hillary's file boxes is a hilarious example.  About the time that the White House claimed that boxes of suppoenaed evidence disappeared from the White House, Patterson notes that Hillary started taking some file boxes everywhere she went, never letting them out of her site.  He never saw the contents, but he just &quot;knew&quot; that they contained the lost evidence. Well, any person who didn't like the Clintons and believed that they had engaged in criminal behavior would &quot;know&quot; the same thing, but most of us wouldn't print it as *fact* in a book without any other evidence!<br />THERE ARE A LOT OF CAREFULLY RESEARCHED BOOKS REGARDING LEGAL ABUSES BY THE CLINTONS AND THEIR WHITE HOUSE.

There is a simple yet challenging message to this book: Whatever you are experiencing is what you have created in your mind.  This is not a message for those who believe strongly in Fate.  And it is even challenging for those of us who claim to believe in Free Will.  For ALLEN TRULY BELIEVES THAT BY CHANGING OUR THOUGHTS, WE CAN CHANGE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />That is very different from most self-help books, which allow for circumstances beyond our control.  In those books, the best we can do is to choose our response.  Allen goes beyond that.  He writes, &quot;Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions. But when he realizes that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes the rightful master of himself.&quot;<br />Allen is not some alchemist.  If he was, he'd be hocking his book as a get-rich-quick scheme on an infomercial.  No, the key to the mastery of circumstances for Allen is very difficult.  We cannot be master of ourselves if all we do is react to circumstances.  We must give ourselves to wholeness, to fulfillment in our relationships, to our ideals and dreams.  These are the best parts of ourselves.<br />THIS IS NOT A SELF-HELP BOOK.  IT IS A MEDITATION.  There are no steps to follow.  It deserves to be read and re-read for years.  And in conjunction with reading this book, I recommend that you write out your true-self thoughts.  Who are you when you're at your best?  How do you treat other people?  How are you living and what are you accomplishing?  Then commit yourself to meditate on those until they are so true that you can no longer not act upon them.	2003-12-08

You may be stuck getting prospects or following up, for example.  2) Decide which marketing strategies you will use.  THE STRATEGIES YOU CHOOSE WILL DEPEND ON WHERE YOU ARE STUCK IN YOUR MARKETING PROCESS AND ON YOUR OWN TALENTS AND INTERESTS.

There is very little insight here, and the result is very disappointing.  As someone who has been affected greatly and thought deeply about Bruce's music, I couldn't even finish reading it.<br />Here are the criticisms of what I did read:<br />* Superficial commentary on songs worthy of great comment<br />* Very poor editing: I think Coles just transcribed his interviewees stories directly from tape without editing.  It's like one big run-on sentence.  It is choppy and totally unlyrical.  Frankly, it hurts my eyes!<br />* Some of the people aren't even Bruce fans.

I love his vision for Christian communities that manifest the life of Christ in healing relationships.  He introduced this (imperfectly) in his book, Connecting.  THIS BOOK FALLS FAR SHORT OF BEING A HEALTHY ENTRY POINT INTO COMMUNITY AND TRANSFORMATION.<br />Crabb begins well enough. Who can't recognize that suffering seems omnipresent?  We all feel that as God's children we were promised something better.  We all suspect that the promises we read in Scripture are fraudulent.  He frankly discuses our angst and pain, giving voice to some deep pain that many of us don't even know how to articulate.<br />PROBLEM 1: CRABB NEEDS AN EDITOR.  He admits that he writes with a pen and paper.  It seems to me that he dashes off his thoughts in stream-of-conscious sessions without regard for what he's written previously.  His writing follows a loosely organized path forward, but he constantly backtracks in repeating himself and sidetracks by incorporating extraneous information.<br />PROBLEM 2: MAJOR POINTS ARE POORLY SUPPORTED.  One of the ways the editorial problem manifests itself is in weak proofs of strong assertions.  For example, in chapter nine, Larry opines, \\"People who find some way to deaden their pain never discover their desire for God in all its fulness.\\"  For those who may be skeptical of such a statement, he then offers, \\"Think with me about how this works.\\"  As a proof of how it works, he writes, \\"That is the function of pain, to carry us into the inner recesses of our being that wants God.\\"  That clearly is not a proof but merely a restatement of the thesis.<br />Some other examples: Larry makes the statement, \\"Deliverance from despair always comes through a person.\\"  He also imagines that the wedding toast for Ruth in Ruth 4 (that she would be like Rachel and Leah) was somehow a hidden wish for sanctified suffering.  Clearly, it was nothing more than a wish that she would be a matriarch.<br />PROBLEM 3: WEAK PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF PAIN.  After hemming and hawing for 190 pages about how hard pain is and that God intends pain to draw us near to him, Larry offers a prescription for experiencing the joy that God promises us.<br />Larry's prescription is basically this: Think about God as a holy God of passionate wrath, and think about yourself as arrogant people who deserve eternal misery.  UH, OKAY... I'LL GRANT THAT THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN THAT.  BUT THAT'S WHAT I SLOGGED THROUGH 190 PAGES FOR?<br />* WHERE IS THE CASE STUDY EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS CRABB'S PRESCRIPTION?  He is a psychologist.  Can't he provide some proof that this is the way to deal with the problem of pain?<br />* WHY DOESN'T CRABB FOCUS ON THE CHRISTIAN'S EXALTED POSITION IN CHRIST?  Doesn't the Bible have a lot to say about who we are in Christ?  We are no longer \\"people who deserve eternal misery.\\"  Wouldn't it benefit us greatly as Christians to embrace our exalted status?<br />* WHY DOESN'T CRABB FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITY AS A SOURCE OF HEALING?  There is nary a word in this book about how our Christian communities can/should help us to deal with the problem of pain.<br />As I considered what was wrong with Crabb's prescription, many thoughts came to mind regarding the faulty assumptions Larry makes that lead him to such a powerless prescription.<br />* Larry has a very fatalistic view of suffering: NOWHERE DOES CRABB QUESTION THE ROLE THAT OUR OWN PERSONAL DECISIONS OR CULTURAL INFLUENCES PLAY IN OUR SUFFERING.  My 40-year old brother-in-law who just had colon cancer can view God correctly until he's blue in the face.  What he really needs to do is quit eating that 1/2-pound of beef and a pint of ice cream each day!<br />* CRABB'S PRESCRIPTION FOR SUFFERING DOES NOT INCLUDE A PLACE FOR ACTION.  Why not?  There is no such thing as mental assent.  Truly embracing what Christ has for us is inseparable from taking action.<br />Like Connecting, this book feels unfinished.  He spends the bulk of the book stating and restating his thesis that only in suffering can we realize all that God has for us, then he fails to present a valid prescription for how to truly embrace suffering.  I could go on.  My copy of the book was marked with many, many critical comments that I'm not writing here.<br />...TRY:<br />* Henri Nouwen's The Wounded Healer<br />* C.S.

YOU CAN'T.  Parness' story is real and compelling, and he believes that it could be yours, too. You could go from $30,000 to $7 million in 18 months, like he did. But you won't with his book because he doesn't tell you how. He plants ideas in our heads, then leaves us hanging on the details of implementation. I SUSPECT THIS BOOK IS MOSTLY AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR HIS WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES HE SELLS ON IT.<br />This book has a lot of great ideas about how to take advantage of short-term trends in individual stocks. Parness talks about how to use news, expected earnings, stock splits, etc., to capitalize on predictable behavior in stocks. His examples are tantalizing, though he only uses made-up, idealized examples. But he doesn't tell you rules for determining if a stock that is going to split is actually going to rise in price. He tells you how to take advantage of price pullbacks for better entry prices, but he doesn't tell you how to tell if a pullback is a pullback or a reversal.<br />This writing might be most irresponsible when it comes to talking about options. Options are powerful tools, but a person can lose his shirt, mostly because of the loss of time value in the option. People who get excited about the idea of options and begin trading without really studying and learning the discipline that goes into options trading are fodder for the experts.<br />That all said, the book is an entertaining read. He does throw out some good ideas. Just be sure to follow them up by reading other experts.<br />The bottom line is that if you want to take these ideas and run, you would be best advised to do a lot of paper trading to flesh out a detailed and disciplined system. Otherwise, you risk approaching the market as a gambler rather than an intelligent risk-taker--even Parness admits the latter is better.	2003-09-06

Foster has written a comprehensive guide to spiritual disciplines.  It is deep, yet accessible.  Most of the reviews here agree with that.<br />I've read this book 5 times in 8 years.  I've been in churches where multiple people were reading it at the same time.  I've been in small groups where everyone read it together.  I've seen mature Christians read it.  I've seen new Christians read it.  And I've concluded that THIS BOOK CAN BE DANGEROUS.<br />The reason I say that is that even in the most non-legalistic churches I've ever seen, I've seen immature Christians stumble in part because they are overwhelmed by everything in this book.  And when I say &quot;stumble&quot;, I'm talking about people going back into severely addictive lifestyles.  And the pressure they felt from feeling like they have to do all these disciplines contributed to that.<br />Unfortunately, it's easy for any of us to filter even the most well-intentioned, well-written book through our false self, that part of us that is performance- and fear-oriented.  Spiritual disciplines do not change us; they open our hearts to the change that the Spirit of God wants to bring.<br />Again, I think this is a phenomenal book. But lest we feed our heads instead of our hearts and lest we frustrate ourselves with a standard of righteousness that Foster never intended, I'd like to humbly, humbly suggest some things:<br />* I personally recommend that people start with Henri Nouwen's &quot;Way of the Heart&quot; for a primer on spiritual discipline.  It is just much simpler.  The big stuff can come later.  (Other books by Merton, Nouwen, Keating, etc., will work just as well.)<br />* Get a spiritual director--I'm not talking about a pastoral counselor, though it may be a pastor; I'm talking about a spiritually mature guide who is only interested in your spiritual development, not your money or your time.<br />* Read this book with other people who can provide feedback to you on how they see you responding.<br />* Keep it simple: Pray, pray, pray; trust the Lord to guide your heart into other disciplines.  Attempt other disciplines when your motivation is to honor God and mortify your flesh, not when it is to &quot;get something&quot;, even if that &quot;something&quot; is spiritual maturity.they see you responding.<br />* Keep it simple: Pray, pray, pray; trust the Lord to guide your heart into other disciplines.

Okay, guys, TEN books (with more planned) to fabricate a story around everything the Bible has to say about the tribulation (which ain't much when you put it against the rest of the Bible) is ENOUGH!  Why do people keep giving these guys money?  Isn't the agenda--to keep spinning out more and more books until the last dollar is squeezed from the buying public---obvious?<br />The theology in these books is horribly weak--honestly, only Americans believe that Christ will rapture believers BEFORE the tribulation.  This theology has no basis in history, nor is it shared by Christians around the world. Try telling some woman in India whose husband has just been pulled into pieces by horses for their faith that Jesus is returning before the tribulation.  C'mon Americans, can we open our eyes?  Are we so naive as to think that the tribulation couldn't possibly involve OUR suffering?  Doesn't the Bible have a lot to say about suffering?

The book is primarily an application of Bowen family systems theory to the Christian life.  Its target audience is Christian leaders in that the anecdotal evidence is drawn from leaders' lives and the results are applied to congregational settings.<br />One important message for leaders is that the important elements of Bowen family systems theory --seeing systems instead of merely looking for simple cause and effect, identifying one's own habitual responses to anxiety and conflict, disciplining one's self to be a present, calm, loving influence in the midst of conflict, etc.-- are essential components of the leaders toolkit.  I believe that done properly, as acts of surrendering control to Christ and choosing to love others unconditionally, the material in this book comprises some new spiritual disciplines.<br />I believe that this book is important for several reasons:<br />* It is one of the most articulate, secular or Christian, explanations of Bowen family systems theory<br />* It explains the theory in the context of Scripture and Christ; frankly, it is only in Christ that we can have the hope of truly being free to love and free from the influence of our anxious world<br />* It recognizes that all the church growth how-to books in the world are worthless if the leader lives life reacting to others and being an anxious presence in the life of the church<br />* It calls the leader to take responsibility for his/her own behavior, recognizing that learning to love others will result in them learning to love, too<br />Leader, is their a cold war of silence going on between you and one or more of your immediate family or between you and one or more of your church leaders or parishioners?  Are you engaged in a power struggle with somebody else in your family or church?  You need to read this book.  It will help you to take responsibility for your part and to develop a capacity for choosing to love others even in the midst of conflict.<br />While the target audience is Christian leaders, this book will benefit anyone, particularly any Christian. For we all lead in some way, whether that is just in a family setting or some responsibility in our jobs.  And we all our leaders regardless of position if we will obey Jesus' instructions to lead by serving.st of conflict.<br />While the target audience is Christian leaders, this book will benefit anyone, particularly any Christian.

Manning sometimes gets criticized as a &quot;one trick pony&quot;.  He is indeed a one-trick pony.  I don't say it as a criticism, though, because his message is so consistently powerful. MANNING CONTINUES TO FIND KNEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE MIGHTY GRACE OF GOD TOWARD IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE. What could get old about that?<br />Manning has two core messages: 1) We are depraved people in need of rescue, and 2) God's grace is relentless in delivering that rescue.  Since he first wrote &quot;Ragamuffin Gospel&quot;, he has continued to explore these two themes from different angles.  &quot;Ruthless Trust&quot; focused on the nature of true trust and our need to trust God.  &quot;The Signature of Jesus&quot; focuses on what true discipleship looks like, the stamp of this loving God on the ragamuffin soul.<br />&quot;The Wisdom of Tenderness&quot; focuses on our need to &quot;let go and let God&quot;, as John Wimber used to say.  It is about living a life of letting God minister his love to us.  The chapter titled &quot;Fierce Mercy&quot; is worth the price of the book alone.  By the end of this chapter, when Manning wrote, &quot;We're so poor that not even our poverty is our own,&quot; I felt as if I had *finally* grasped Manning's message (with my heart) to quit trying to earn God's grace and just let him give it to me.<br />I'm wired such that I'm trying to earn God's approval even when I think I'm not.  Manning's message is such a breath of fresh air in our performance-based society.  And its repetition in his various writings is a critical reminder of its importance.  If we would be free, we must breathe this message frequently.	2003-01-31

There are some more complete handbooks/encyclopedias for Tolkien's writings out there, but I think that a newbie might find them overwhelming.<br />This book is firmly focused on the Lord of the Rings trilogy, drawing information from Tolkien's other books only if it provides useful background to people or events in the Rings trilogy.  For instance, there is background on an ancient marriage between a human man (Beren) and an elf woman (Luthien)that sets the stage for the romance between Aragorn and Arwen.  My understanding is that Tolkien's other writings contain many other stories, characters, and settings that are not necessary for the understanding of the Rings trilogy.<br />The Rings movie was my introduction to Tolkien.  Since then, I have read the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit.  I fully expect that as I continue to read Tolkien and continue to be fascinated by the world he created that I will buy a more complete handbook.  But for now, this is a good source of information.	2002-11-29

I believe in the power of the inner person to shine light.  I am presently searching for my true vocation.  So, this book should be manna, right?  It is good.  I benefitted, and I can recommend it.  But it is too flawed for me to give the highest marks.<br />The flaw is understandable:  Palmer believes just a little too highly in the goodness of the human spirit/conscience.  He gives it an ultimate authority.  Palmer probably only has friends who are really good people, whose conscience is a worthy guiding light.  But there are a lot of people in our society whose conscience is not good.  For those people, direction must first come from submission to an external voice, call it principle or natural law or God or whatever you want.  Only when their conscience has changed can it serve as the 'Voice of Vocation'.<br />If this flaw is recognized, Palmer's book is quite valuable.  It provides insight in taking that introspective journey in search of vocation. For more on the importance of self-evident principles, read Covey's _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_.<br />Palmer's _To Know As We Are Known_ is one of the 5 most influential books in my life.  I recently completed a 5th reading of it.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend _Let Your Life Speak_ as highly.	2000-11-08

Each article is impressive in its breadth and depth, particularly given the  brevity devoted to such issues as hell and God's sovereignty.  Every  article is comprised of a review of historical teachings on a topic, then  presents the authors reasoned position.  The author's arguments are all  well-constructed.  As such, they are food for thought to anyone interested  in Christian doctrine, whether you agree with the author's position or  not.<br />Additionally, in a world that relegates faith and Christian doctrine  to mystical lunacy, that holds religious belief as subordinate to the  &quot;facts&quot; of science, it is refreshing to read logical arguments  for Christian doctrine.	2000-09-07

Lacugna makes learning about the doctrine A VERY REWARDING  EXPERIENCE.<br />She summarizes the development of the doctrine from the first  century to today.  Her intent, however, is to argue that the doctrine of  the Trinity is not an explanation of a God who is somewhere &quot;out  there&quot; in eternity, but rather an explanation of the community of a  God who is present and inviting us into community.  She supports her  position well, drawing from the ancients and contemporary Orthodox and  Catholic theologians.<br />The subject matter of the book is very challenging.  It will take most people awhile to get through the material.

This is easily the best book on finding God's will I have ever read.  It succeeds because Willard recognizes there are no formulas.  The way to find God's will is to find God and learn how to converse with him.  Willard  argues that in seeking God's will, we generally are asking the wrong  questions: &quot;What job should I take?&quot; &quot;Whom should I  marry?&quot;  Those questions are legitimate but should be secondary to  desires to have a deep relationship with God.  It is in that relationship  with God that the questions of our lives get answered.  Willard then  explores what the Bible teaches regarding ways in which God communicates  with us.

It is the handbook for modern Christians who want to live life as close to the abyss as possible.  It cheapens the Lord's grace by reducing salvation to a cheap prayer rather than the heart  commitment clearly required in Scripture.

There certainly are abuses in charismatic Christianity that need correction.  MacArthur takes the worst of these and portrays them as the norm for all charismatic believers.  In  doing so, he drags wonderful believers (John Wimber and Jack Deere to name  two) through the mud and gives biblical teaching on the unity of believers  a black eye. No, Wimber and Deere are not theologically correct on every  point of the Christian faith.  Who is?  But they love God and do not  deserve to be associated with the Simon the Sorcerers of Christianity.<br />MacArthur cannot make his point on Scripture alone, so he appeals to the  historical record.  His logic is: &quot;If we don't see the supernatural in  the historical record, clearly  the Bible must teach that they ceased with  the death of the apostles.&quot;  The flaw of that logic is obvious, but in  order to make that point, MacArthur has to ignore the whole of church  history which is filled with the supernatural!<br />I think MacArthur's  &quot;Gospel According to Jesus&quot; is excellent.  Unfortunately, he is  so blind on the issue of gifts of the Spirit that he is incapable of  applying the same integrity in scholarship to this issue.  I will not  question his heart for the Lord; I believe that he loves God with all his  heart.  But he is wrong about the gifts of the Spirit, and this is truly  one of the worst books I've ever read.<br />Jesus promises in John 7 that if  you are sincere in wanting to know truth, it will be revealed.  As you read  this book, pray for sincerity in the quest to know Truth.	1998-12-01

As an evangelical Christian, I have been exposed to do! do! do! my whole life.  The path to eternal life -- knowing God (Jn. 17:3) -- begins in solitude, silence, and prayer.  As Nouwen reveals, it is only from the knowing of God that begins in the quiet of one's heart that effective ministry can take place.	1998-05-31

The book has definitely influenced me to change the objective and methods of my teaching.  But its value in my personal life cannot be measured.  Palmer's teaching regarding the communal nature of truth and the necessity of obedience to that which is learned forces deep introspection.  What words of knowledge have I let fall to the ground in my search for the next great idea or intellectual stimulant?  Introspection on this matter brings me to understand that entering troth with knowledge frees me to live simply, in community with mankind.  Dave	1998-01-09

Easily the best (and actually the shortest) of the many books I have read on God's attributes.  This book is not concerned with counting God's attributes or merely providing academic information.  God is presented in both his transcendent and immanent splendor.  We at once kneel in awe and fear and gratefully reach for his hand of friendship.	1998-01-09

His Word for us seems too easy, but unfortunately it is a biblical truth that has been forgotten through time: God promises grace for all our needs.
