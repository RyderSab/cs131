Some of the exercises help with overcoming anger, others help in learning to develop compassion for others. The part that I found most helpful was learning how NOT to react to others negative comments, especially because this causes unnecessary suffering. Overall, the book was helpful for someone who is going through a difficult time such as a loss of a child. I have applied some of the comforting principles after going through the devastating loss of hurricane Katrina and Rita since I live in the New Orleans area.	2005-10-10

I know she was a remarkable woman. Everything that I have seen and heard about her has been outstanding. I was excited when I found this book. <br />However, I felt disappointed by this book. It was rather boring and dry. Dorothy must have been very humble, because she writes about herself in a mundane fashion. It sounds like this is the diary account of her life. I guess she must not have realized how heroic she really was. She also experienced significant pain and isolation in her life, hence the title.	2004-10-23

It came highly recommended by my Spiritual Director. I found it to be life-changing.... Richard Hauser, SJ, encourages the reader to rethink his/her current model of spirituality by understanding the concept that \\"Christ lives within us\\" (Eastern model) rather than \\"outside of us\\" (Western model). We learn more about the difference and are encouraged to live our lives with Christ within, rather than striving to please an external God. A very subtle difference, yet highly empowering!	2003-06-14

The pictures are very well-done and are especially descriptive with arrows illustrating clearly the correct movement when doing the stretch. My favorite 2 pages in the book are &quot;Everyday Stretches&quot; used for 10-15 min per day to fine-tune your muscles and reduce stress. These daily exercises are clearly outlined with pictures and can easily be completed once a day even with a busy lifestyle!	2003-05-31

Medications are listed alphabetically but also have the generic name, pronunciation, functional class and chemical class listed beneath.

It was required reading for a course in Quantitative Nursing Research last semester. Overall, the concepts such as t-tests, correlation and regression were explained in relatively simple terms. Examples with answers were found at the end of each chapter and the book came with a data disk. This was the most user-friendly statistics book that I have used so far!	2003-05-31

Recently, when I decided to go to Mass everyday, I decided to buy the Weekday Missal as well. I purchased it for the same reasons that I bought the Sunday Missal: I wanted to have my own personal copy to study at home. I didn't like handling the pew copy since so many people (with colds, flu) handle it. It is a great bargain since it lasts for years!	2003-05-14

I feel very satisfied with it. I know I am more organized and better prepared for Mass. I can read the commentary ahead of time and reflect on the Readings/Gospel if I choose. It has also helped me select songs for choir practice that fit the theme for each Sunday. <br />Overall, it is a great bargain! The Millennium Edition lasts until at least 2021. Very inexpensive when you think how long it lasts. Most importantly, and the main reason I purchased it, is that I am the only person to handle it. Just think about how many hundreds of people (with colds and flu) handle the paper copy in the pew....	2003-05-14

The pictures are just beautiful and the write-up is done in fancy lettering. It makes a wonderful gift. <br />In each section, there is a description and history, a medicinal section and properties for each oil. My favorite is LAVENDER: Did you know that Lavender Oil is used as the basic ingredient of many fragrances? Lavender has a calming effect and this book recommends a drop of lavender oil on your pillow or in your bath to promote a restful sleep. Properties of lavender include a muscle relaxant, sedative, antidepressant and others....	2003-04-29

She skillfully decribes both good-times and bad in Stamps, Arkansas where she and her brother, raised by her grandmother and uncle, took on many childhood adventures in and around her grandmother's general store in the Negro section of town. She devotes several chapters to a time when she and her brother lived in Long Beach, California with her fast moving mother and indifferent father. When things go bad, she describes her return to a simple yet orderly life in Stamps.<br />The reader is touched by the difficulties overcome by Maya Angelou and has a new appreciation for those who were raised in a different place and time. Her upbringing filled with discipline, hard-work and solid roles models had a positive impact on her as a person. She was able to overcome the negative influences. <br />Most of all, the key to her success is contagious and when finished, the reader is left with a glimmer of hope that if she can do it, so can I.... no matter what my walk of life.

By noting the last digit of your year of birth, you will find your element in the chart. For example if you were born in 1960, METAL is your element and your personality is yang (extrovert). The chacteristics of METAL are: controlled, organized, idealistic and authoritative. If you are METAL, you are compatible with METAL (0,1) EARTH (8,9) and WATER (2,3) but are incompatible with WOOD (4,5) and FIRE (6,7). <br />You will find out how to balance those incompatible elements by reading this book and more....	2003-03-07

I've used this book as a resource over and over when coding orthopedic surgery reports. It gives detailed, yet simple pictures and very concise, easy-to-understand explanations of orthopedic terms in each section. The chapters are broken down into sections on the spine, hand/wrist, foot/ankle as well as many others.

It helps me when I get &quot;stuck&quot; in choosing the right code. The book gives the &quot;lay&quot; description of the CPT code in all sections except lab, radiology and pathology (they have a separate book). I use this book along with other resources, including discussion with the physician, to gain insight into choosing one code over another.

It has great illustrations that make understanding the anatomy of the code much easier. I also prefer this edition to the expert because some of the wording in the expert edition is more crowded and less eye-appealing. Also, the spiral-bound version is easier to handle if you use the book on a regular basis.	2003-01-21

I certainly have.... And I have found this book to be extremely clear in helping me sort through the proper use of each one. This is actually one of the reference books that we order each year for our department (Coding and Compliance Dept of a large physician practice). We all agree that it is one of the most useful references for coding. <br />It gives a detailed description of each modifier (-24, -57, -91, etc.) including using the modifier correctly, coding tips, clinical examples plus flow diagrams in the back of the book to help you check your selection process for each modifier. All of the modifiers are included and are categorized into E/M, Anesthesia, Surgical, Radiology, Laboratory/Pathology and Medicine sections very much like the CPT book.<br />Overall, I recommend this highly as a helpful resource if you work in the coding/compliance field or in a physician or billing practice where you would use modifiers on a regular basis.	2003-01-21
