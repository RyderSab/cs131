That has changed drastically with the explosive growth of the Internet, which has revolutionized retailing, but has also made it easier for thieves to hawk counterfeit product.<br /><br />Leading brands are finding the Internet to be a perfect vehicle for reaching out to their existing customers and finding new customers. The flip side is that for every Internet marketing method there exists a nefarious online activity that exploits the power and goodwill of established brands. For example, rumors and fictitious product information can hurt companies' brands.<br /><br />Never before have companies faced such a siege on their intellectual property and brands, so the publication of Defending the Brand is timely. In a fascinating depiction of today's threats, the book explains in lay terms how an organization can develop a strategy to fight brand thieves.<br /><br />The eleven chapters are replete with real-world examples of how companies such as Home Depot and Disney have struggled to protect their brands online. The author furnishes effective advice on how companies can better deal with situations ranging from digital brand abuse to illegal distribution. At 250 pages, Defending the Brand is a quick and fascinating read.	2005-10-03

In the early 1970s, the U.S. government put out an open call for a new, stronger encryption algorithm that would be made into a federal standard, known as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard.). Numerous solutions were submitted as the DES candidate, including one from IBM. The IBM solution, originally called Lucifer, was chosen to be used as the encryption algorithm. After that, it became known as DES.<br /><br />DES is the most widely used method of symmetric data encryption ever created. Its 56-bit key size means that there are roughly 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) possible encryption keys for any given message. DES was always considered a strong encryption method, but strength is relative.<br /><br />The strength of an encryption system is measured by how resilient it is against attack. From the outset, it was known that DES was susceptible to brute force attacks. A brute force attack, also known as an exhaustive search is an attack against a cryptosystem in which all possible values for the key are attempted - the bigger the key, the more difficult the attack.<br /><br />It must be remembered that DES was developed long before desktop computers, so the feasibility of a computer that could perform a brute force attack against DES was rendered so expensive and infeasible that the 56-bit key space (in a 64-bit block) of DES was considered strong enough. In reality, Lucifer actually had an original design of a 128-bit block size and 112-bit key size, but politics got in the way, and DES was created in a crippled state from the onset.<br /><br />By 1997, DES was cracked, and the start of its downfall had commenced. Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption Standard is a firsthand account of how DES was broken. Author Matt Curtin was a member of the DESCHALL team, which was created in response to the RSA Security Inc. RSA Secret Key Challenge. The challenge was to break a DES-encrypted message.<br /><br />Brute Force comprises two interrelated parts. Part 1 is a short overview of cryptography and encryption. It also details how Curtin first became interested in cryptography in the Bexley, Ohio, public library. Part 1 sets the groundwork for the main subject matter of the book, which is Curtin's diary of how DES was broken via DESCHALL.<br /><br />The unofficial mantra of DESCHALL was that friends didn't let friends have idle computers. DESCHALL was led by Curtin, Rocke Verser, Matt Curtin, and Justin Dolske, and used an Internet-based distributed computing infrastructure. Since brute force attacks are naturally suited to distributed computing, it made for a perfect testing ground to break DES.<br /><br />Part 2 details the ups and downs of the project. Designing a software system to crunch up to 72 quadrillion is not a easy task, combined with key server crashes, competitive foreign groups, and the U.S. government on your back, made the travails of DESCHALL a challenging endeavor. The success of DESCHALL was to get as many hosts involved as possible. Given the fact that the CPUs of most computers sit idle for most of their lives, such CPUs were of extreme value to DESCHALL.<br /><br />While Brute Force can be dry at times (remember, this is a book about cryptography), it does have its humorous moments. Much of DESCHALL occurred in the summer of 1997, and many universities had powerful computers that would sit idle all summer. DESCHALL members attempted to harness that power and were astounded when the computer lab manager of Yale University refused to allow the labs computer to run DESCHALL client software. He stated that the computers had the newest processors in them and that he did not want to wear them out. Furthermore, the lab manager thought that running DESCHALL software would void the warranty with the computer manufacturer due to the undue strain it would place on the processor.<br/><br />The DESCHALL team was victorious in June 1997 when they finally cracked the RSA Secret Key Challenge after processing about 25% of the 72 quadrillion keys. The message was encrypted with the appropriate message \\"Strong Cryptography Makes the World a Safer Place\\". DESCHALL succeeding in starting the beginning of the end of DES, which has since been replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).<br /><br />Brute Force is about as entertaining a read as you will get on cryptography. It provides a detailed account of how DES was taken down and is a interesting read for any student of cryptography and the crypto wars of the 1990s.ace on the processor.  <br /> <br />The DESCHALL team was victorious in June 1997 when they finally cracked the RSA Secret Key Challenge after processing about 25% of the 72 quadrillion keys.

US	48840057	R2GF4YE0R5695Y	1590594843	637130404	Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Superb NTP reference	If you review the thousands of Internet RFCs, you'd be hard pressed to find a protocol that lends itself to philosophical overtones, save for one -- the Network Time Protocol (NTP). The nature of time is abstract, difficult to measure and highly subjective. Yet time is a critical element in everyone's life, and in the effective operations of corporate networks.\\"<br /><br />NTP is built on top of the TCP/IP protocol suite and is used to ensure accurate time-keeping with a trusted time reference. These references can be radio signals, GPS satellites, atomic clocks, Internet-based time servers and more. NTP is powerful enough to synchronize network clocks with millisecond accuracy.<br /><br />In Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience in Time with NTP, Peter Rybaczyk merges the philosophical aspects of time with the nuts of bolts of the NTP protocol. The book is composed of two parts, the first concerned with the meta-philosophy of time, and the second detailing the inner workings of NTP. The attempt in part one to merge technology and science with philosophy is a daunting task, and most often does not succeed. The notable exception to this is Douglas Hofstadter's G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.<br /><br />Rybaczyk creates Sam, a fictional character who walks through the history of time. It is unclear who this Sam is -- whether he is supernatural being, or someone who got root on a time server. The author writes that the transcendental nature of time and the nuts and bolts of NTP are inseparable, but I personally found it difficult to determine what message part one was meant to convey. Fortunately, part one takes up but the first 34 pages.<br /><br />Where the book shines, and where most readers will find value, is in part two, which details how to effectively design, configure, deploy and operate NTP. Where part one is conceptual, part two is extremely practical. Chapter 3 opens up with a comprehensive overview of the what, how and why effective time-keeping via NTP is needed.<br /><br />The book details from a business perspective why synchronized and accurate time is a universal need. From transactional integrity, airline departures, sporting events, job shift changes, to FedEx pickups and more, nearly every activity requires time synchronization to work at peak levels. Effective network administration also requires time synchronization for network login procedures, directory synchronization, backups, and routing stability to work accurately.<br /><br />From an information security perspective, password and digital ID synchronization, log file accuracy and auditing, and access control security are just a few of the areas where correct time can mean the difference between success and failure.<br /><br />Where time synchronization is crucial, though, is in the realm of digital forensics. An otherwise painstaking digital forensic process might be worthless if time-related evidence from network devices is not correctly synchronized. If network devices are not correctly synchronized, you can basically forget about using them in any type of legal case.<br /><br />Attorney Ronald Coleman, partner and computer law litigator at the New Jersey-based Coleman Law firm explains that in a computer law case involving serious discrepancies in network log times, the prosecution would conceivably drop the case. Similarly, a civil case to recover damages from an attacker is seriously undercut by these seemingly innocuous timing mistakes. \\"The network managers' lack of diligence at ensuring that the time was synchronized on their systems,\\" explains Coleman, \\"opens them up to serious questions in front of a jury as to whether the logs and the system data are reliable at all -- especially with a gap of more than a couple of minutes, which might be explained away by which clocks were being relied on.\\" In fact, an error of this magnitude would make the entire network administration suspect. That could be a disaster, Coleman says, where the network tracing record plus the human beings who sloppily set the automation in motion are going to be the chief sources of evidence against the alleged computer criminal. \\"A snafu such as seriously unsynchronized logs is just the sort of opening that could raise the level of doubt needed to undermine the other side's case.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 3 concludes with an interesting look at the cutting edge of time protocols, specifically the Interplanetary Internet. The Interplanetary Internet project is an attempt to synchronize computer time within the realm of deep space. NASA will in due time establish a deep space infrastructure whose purpose is to support the communication needs of multiple missions. Such an infrastructure would require time synchronization, but within a radically different framework from what exists today. The Interplanetary Internet and its underlying time synchronization are intended to solve that.<br /><br />Chapter 4 brings the reader back to earth and provides vital information about how to design an effective NTP architecture. The key to designing the most appropriate NTP architecture for a given infrastructure is to first understand the different modes that NTP devices can operate in. The chapter details the five different NTP modes, the mode categories, and gives configuration information about each mode.<br /><br />The chapter also provides information about NTP security. While NTP versions 3 and 4 provide added security (including symmetric private key cryptography and support of the Autokey protocol), it is ultimately up to the organization to determine what level of NTP security they need. Those organizations that don't require accurate time won't need much NTP security. But for those organizations who business requires synchronized and accurate time, such issues will drive the implementation of how they deploy NTP and its security functionality.<br /><br />Chapter 5 details how organizational motivations (again, from a business perspective) will affect how you design your NTP architecture, and then describes several use scenarios. The book notes that designing an effective NTP deployment is a process that embodies four key steps: choosing a time source, deciding upon the NTP topology, determining the NTP features to configure, and then monitoring and managing the NTP operations. The chapter then goes on to describe various ways these steps can be carried out. The chapter provides a comprehensive overview on how to deploy NTP, be it on a dedicated time server, via already deployed products such as Cisco or Juniper routers, or on Unix/Linux/Windows file servers.<br /><br />It is important to note that NTP is just the protocol. The actual implementation of NTP requires separate software client and server applications. The book focuses on the protocol and does not get into any specific vendors, other than a few screen shots from the configuration menu of a Symmetricom time server.<br /><br />The author notes that on the surface, NTP is simple and almost inconspicuous, and overshadowed by better-known protocols such as HTTP, FTP and DNS. But once you start digging into NTP, you are dealing with one of the most pervasive elements of existence, namely time. Within NTP's scope, one could be dealing with atomic clocks, GPS satellites, clock selection, encryption algorithms and much more. So while at its heart, NTP may be a simple protocol, there is a complex infrastructure beneath it.<br /><br />NTP is one of the most fundamental, yet overlooked services in the TCP/IP suite, and time synchronization is one of the most overlooked areas in networking. Hopefully, a book such as this can spark a renaissance. For far too long, time synchronization has not been afforded due diligence, and the effects have at times been disastrous. A view of the archives of the Risk Forum digest attests to this fact.<br /><br />After a somewhat murky start in part one, Expert Network Time Protocol: An Experience inTime with NTP provides the reader with a superb synopsis of nearly everything he needs to know about NTP and effective time synchronization on his network, from an experienced implementer in the field.

Given the dynamic nature of technology, very few technology books can stand the test of time and remain relevant for a few years, let alone a decade after their original printing. Some of those rare titles that seem timeless include Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier, Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems by Ross Anderson, and the book I'll review here, Information Security Policies Made Easy, Version 10. Information Security Policies Made Easy (ISPME) is one of the most important information security books available for those who are serious about creating a comprehensive set of information systems security policies.<br /><br />The importance of effective information security policies cannot be overemphasized, as they are the foundation toward implementing information security and ensuring the security of the people, systems, and networks within an organization. If an organization lacks security policies, they cannot inform employees and users of their specific security responsibilities. Policies define acceptable system use and user behavior, and those policies must be in place before they can be enforced.<br /><br />Version 10 of ISPME contains more than 1350 pre-written security policies that can be used as a framework for the creation of a comprehensive set of information security policies. The book comes with a CD-ROM that includes every policy. The beauty of ISPME is that it removes the huge burden and time required to create a global set of security policies. With ISPME, you can immediately begin exploring the myriad policies required for information security.<br /><br />One of the biggest mistakes you could make, however, when using ISPME, is to implement a policy too quickly, without deciding specifically how those policies with be selected, developed, deployed, maintained, and enforced. With that, Chapter 2 provides an orientation to the information security policy writing and development process. The books states that while it may be tempting to immediately start cutting and pasting policies together, it is crucial to understand both what the policies do and what you want to accomplish with them before you begin. If that is done, the subsequent policy writing tasks will be much more efficient and focused.<br /><br />At 501 pages, Chapter 3 comprises the bulk of the book and contains the all of the specific policies. These policies are divided into 10 separate domains that are mapped to the ISO-17799 standard. This organization scheme makes it makes it easy to create a gap-analysis of your current policies against the ISO-17799 standard. This is helpful since many organizations are now embracing ISO-17799.<br /><br />Each of the policies contain the individual policy itself and a detailed commentary on why the policy is specifically needed. Each policy also has a cross-reference to related policies and an indication of the audience (management, technical, end-user) and the security environment (low, medium, high) for which it is written.<br /><br />Chapters 4 - 20 contain various high-level policies in areas such as mobile computing, data classification, email, Web security, and more. These 18 chapters are complete security policy documents that can be implemented with little customization.<br /><br />The book contains 15 appendixes, which include secondary information such as awareness-raising methods, checklists, memos, and next steps to take.<br /><br />The CD-ROM that is included contains the entire set of polices in HTML, Word, and PDF formats. It also includes two documents that map the policies in the book against HIPAA and Sarbanes-Oxley.<br /><br />Organizations that take information security seriously will likely have used ISPME in its previous versions. But for those that have not yet taken the plunge, ISPME is a valuable tool that can be utilized to create a comprehensive set of information securitypolicies in a cost- and time-effective manner. For those building corporate or organizational security policies, ISPME is clearly the definitive reference.information security policies in a cost- and time-effective manner.

So a book about an 80-year-old cryptographic device would seem to be as useful as a maintenance guide for a Model T. There is much to learn in this fascinating account, however.<br /><br />The German Enigma Cipher Machine is the story of one of the most notable pieces of security hardware ever made, an encoding device that looked like a small typewriter. The Germans used it, primarily during World War II, to send confidential communications. In their hubris, the Germans believed that the Enigma was utterly unbreakable and refused to believe otherwise even when their communiqu&eacute;s were being compromised. The Allied Powers were able to break the code after they acquired an Enigma machine and brought together a team of analysts from diverse countries to tease out its secrets.<br /><br />That's the basic story. This book is a collection of various articles from a cryptology journal called Cryptologia. Chapters are written by those who created the Enigma, worked to crack it, or studied it afterwards. Though many of the chapters are highly technical, the book still has enough valuable information for readers without a deep background in encryption.<br /><br />While the Enigma is dead and buried, the problems that doomed it-poor physical security, user error, and overreliance on the technology-are still relevant today. The Model T inventor's statement that \\"History is more or less bunk\\" to the contrary, Enigma provides lasting lessons.	2005-08-01

Security purists may argue that one-time pads are provably and perfectly secure. While that is correct in the pristine halls of academic cryptography, the real world is littered with many one-time pads of dubious security.<br /><br />The fact that everything is breakable from an information security perspective is good news to Luddites and bad news for the paranoid. Hopefully, most people fall between those two opposites and with that, Silence on the Wire: A Field Guide to Passive Reconnaissance and Indirect Attacks is an fascinating book on knowing when to be suspicious and when to be complacent.<br /><br />The premise of the book is that there are countless ways that a potential attacker can intercept information and sniff data. The title points out that these silent stealth-like attacks are often difficult to detect, and all the more so to defend against. The better you understand the threats, the better you can monitor and defend against them.<br /><br />The author writes about his work with data reconnaissance and details how computers and networks operate, with a special emphasis on how they process and transmit data. With such transmissions, there are significant security threats; which is what this book details.<br /><br />Make note that this is not a For Dummies type of book. It is written for security engineers and experienced system administrators that have a heavy background in networking and security. Electronic engineers will feel very much at home with the many schematics and encodings in the code. The book is written for those that are very comfortable with programming and complex networks.<br /><br />The books 260 pages contain four parts and 18 chapters. Part one details the long journey that a keystroke takes. Between the keyboard and the ultimate destination of the data, there are myriad ways the data can be misappropriated. These include traditional attacks, in addition to protocol attacks and problems with the CPU.<br /><br />Part 2 details how data is transmitted and the various avenues of attack that can be launched against the data. Note that the subtitle of the book is a field guide to passive reconnaissance and indirect attacks. The book is all about the passive types of attacks that are often quite prevalent, yet overlooked. In the section The Art of Transmitting Data, the author details the electronic mechanisms on how data traverses a network and the avenues of attacks. One of the easiest attacks is the monitoring of modem or router lights. With the proper analysis and deduction, an attacker can surmise a significant amount about the nature of the traffic.<br /><br />Part 2 closes with an interesting overview of how to provide better security to switched Ethernet networks. The author notes that that Ethernet networks don't provide a universal and easy way to ensure the integrity and confidentiality (two pillars of security) of the data they transmit, or are they engineered to withstand malicious, intentionally injected traffic. Ethernet is simply a means for interfacing a number of local, presumably trusted systems. With such a premise, it is no wonder that security issues abound.<br /><br />Part 3 spends about 100 pages on routing and security issues involved with TCP/IP. While there is not a significant amount of new information in these chapter (passive fingerprinting, fragmentation attacks, sequence number issues and more have been heavily documented), it provides a good overview of the inherent insecurity with the TCP/IP set of protocols.<br /><br />Part 4 is closes with the authors notion of parasitic computing, which is when computations and storage in normal network traffic are hidden. With parasitic computing, data can be stored in mail queues and ICMP echoes, where remote hosts perform remote computations on them.<br /><br />Ifyou are looking for a book on quick tips to securing your network, Silence on the Wire: A Field Guide to Passive Reconnaissance and Indirect Attacks will not fill your need. This is a book written for those that want to know what goes on deep in the recesses of their computers, switches and network protocols. After reading the book, some may view it as an exercise in theoretical problems that bare little resemblance to the real world. But the fact is that many security problems that are originally labeled as theoretical and academic, end up being quite practical and devastating. Many software vendors will reply to a threat with a reply that it only applies to a lab scenario, only to quickly retreat and create a patch.<br /><br />On the down side, the book can be dry at times. When you combine mathematical formulas, electronic engineering and abstract computer security, the book occasionally reads like James Joyce.<br /><br />Overall, Silence on the Wire: A Field Guide to Passive Reconnaissance and Indirect Attacks is a most valuable book.

Books	5	6	7	N	N	Great book for those serious about their customer strategy	Passionate & Profitable: Why Customer Strategies Fail and 10 Steps to Do Them Right has a rather simple premise - spending time and money on customer retention is of no value if it is not done in the context of having a well-defined execution strategy.<br /><br />The goal of the book is to show the reader how to form strong, sustainable, and profitable relationships with customers.  The challenge is that there are many critical decisions and trade-offs that have to be made, but many companies often make the wrong decision.  Another issue is that many companies live by the credo of `Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door'.  The problem is that even with the best mousetrap, the world won't come if you don't have a well-developed customer strategy.  Passionate & Profitable is all about creating that well-developed customer strategy.<br /><br />The book is worth it alone for the 25-question corporation-customer experience aptitude survey on pages 19-20.  The survey examines the health of your relationship with your customers and is likely a good indicator of your profitability.<br /><br />Another great section is pages 109-115 which goes into the organization-focused vs. customer-focused organizational structure.  This section shows how many organizations are created with functional expertise via groups, i.e., engineering, R&D, sales, operations, etc.  Arussy shows that a customer-centric organization must have the customer focused in the center, with the various groups supporting those customers.  The beauty of a customer-centric organization is that all of the employees and functions are fully aligned around the customer cause.<br /><br />Chapter 8 reiterates the importance of organizations training their employees and trusting them to make the correct decision.  A focal point is that if you do not trust your people, do not hire them.  And if you hired them, give them the tools to excel.  After all, their success is your organizations success.<br /><br />For those organizations that are serious about their customer strategy and looking for ways to improve it, Passionate & Profitable is a valuable book that can help achieve that goal.anizations success. <br /> <br />For those organizations that are serious about their customer strategy and looking for ways to improve it, Passionate & Profitable is a valuable book that can help achieve that goal. <br /> <br />	2005-07-06

In fact, as the author makes clear, anyone with an Internet connection is a potential target of online espionage-even by such \\"mundane\\" means as viruses, worms, and phishing attacks-and this book is addressed to that huge audience.<br /><br />Just who is spying on whom? The author explains that the typical person might be a target of bosses, friends, family members, hackers, and many others. Even people with nothing confidential or of value on their computers risk getting caught up in espionage and other cyber capers. For instance, hackers can use their computers as vehicles for staging attacks or as a location for storing illicit files, such as child pornography. And as more cell phones and PDAs connect to the Internet, the risks multiply.<br /><br />What may be disturbing to some readers is that every computer device and peripheral provides at least one avenue of attack. The author explains many of these schemes, such as keystroke loggers and cleartext file transfers via file transfer protocol (FTP). In addition, operating-system and application-level vulnerabilities constitute even more ways that systems can be compromised.<br /><br />Despite the grim picture painted by the author, the book isn't intended to make readers paranoid, but rather to acquaint them with the many risks posed by the Internet. This excellent book shows that someone quite possibly is out to get you, but it provides the tools to protect yourself.	2005-06-01

Author Tom Patterson is a former Big 4 Information Security partner whose job responsibilities saw him living abroad for much of his adult life. The book is not so much a network security title, but rather a guide to performing the business of security across various cultural and physical borders. Mapping Security is management-level source book for companies and organizations that do - or plan to do - business outside of the United States. Patterson takes his years of living abroad, his successes and his failures, his war stories, and his challenges, and maps them into a usable framework so the reader can better deploy an information security program.<br /><br />In the book, Patterson details the various opportunities and challenges in each geographic sector across the globe and provides security best practices, rules, and customs for 30 countries. Patterson does a good job of explaining how and where Americans are often perceived to be arrogant by having a overly U.S.-centric view of things.<br /><br />The book is divided in three parts. Part 1 details the manner in which an effective information security infrastructure can be developed. Chapters 1 through 7 show the necessary steps to building an effective security culture. The book, especially Part 1, is focused not so much on specific technology but rather the processes in which to develop such a security infrastructure.<br /><br />The heart of the book is in Part 2 where Patterson details his Mapping Security Index (MSI). The function of the MSI is to provide the reader with a metric to determine how an organization can perform security functions in a different country. The book has an MSI for 30 countries, but it does not detail every country, only those where U.S.organizations are likely to do business.<br /><br />Peterson's expertise comes from living abroad extensively and bringing to the table how business should be done in whatever country you are dealing with. Two of the countries with the highest MSI are Netherlands (90) and Canada (93), with Russia (26) and Saudi Arabia (32) at the bottom. The main advantages of the Netherlands and Canada are that they both have a safe, stable, and effective infrastructure in which to build an information security organization.<br /><br />Russia, on the other hand, while having a strong technical outsourcing potential has a legal and technical infrastructure that is significantly lacking. Additionally, most other business services are not yet on par with the rest of the region. As to Saudi Arabia, Patterson notes that while it provides a growing domestic marketing, it is an extremely difficult security partner to deal with and has very little cross-border activity. There is extremely little opportunity for women when it comes to the region. He notes that it is practically impossible for women to do business there and observes that \\"surrendering gender equity is simply the cost of doing business in Saudi Arabia\\".<br /><br />Part 3 of the book deals with that challenge of mapping various laws and regulations from different countries. Part of the challenge and headache is dealingwith laws from different countries that are contradictory. For example, one country might require an organization to capture and report customer information, while another country forbids it. The question becomes whose law do you break? That is not an easy question to answer, but it is one that needs to be considered.<br /><br />The author notes that security standards and regulations are the biggest drivers for security around the world and a misstep in dealing with regulations can create the scenario where one could face business impairments, fines, or even prison.<br /><br />Overall, Mapping Security: The Corporate Security Sourcebook for Today's Global Economy is a very valuable reference guide for anyone who needs to deal with information security in different countries and cultures. By relating security to the international community, the book enables the reader to avoid making those mistakes that can sink a security project.<br /><br />Patterson has a keen business insight, and the book provides many of his war stories (from illegal barbeques in Germany to an innocuous racial fax paus in South Africa). The book is not overly technical in nature and is both entertaining and informative. For anyone that plans to deploy security outside of the United States Mapping Security should be required reading.and headache is dealing with laws from different countries that are contradictory.

Install the software and then stop attackers in their tracks.  If only it was so easy.  But one can't simply install monitoring software or an IDS, collect data and expect it all to correlate and correct itself.<br /><br />The beauty of The Tao of Network Security Monitoring : Beyond Intrusion Detection is that it shows how network monitoring requires a strong discipline to truly have an effect on security.<br /><br />The book is written for the person; primarily a system administrator or security engineer whom truly wants to use an IDS to manage and secure their network.  This is not an introductory text, rather it is written for someone not scared of downloading and compiling code.  If you are looking for an intro to IDS usage, this is not the book for you.  This is a book about someone who has an IDS, and needs to find a way to use it and tune it for maximum usage.<br /><br />The book has a near endless supply of network traffic capture and analysis tools, techniques and network topologies.  Beyond simply providing a list of software tools, the book shows how to install and configure a variety of these tools.  Rather than wasting pages and screen shots detailing how to download and install the software mentioned; the book shows how to use the tool in the context or Tao of security monitoring.<br /><br />In addition, the author emphasizes the point that the people are a crucial aspect of effective network monitoring.  The ultimate success of any IDS is directly tied to the analyst behind the console.  They are the ones making the decision on how to respond to an incident, and if they are not appropriately trained, all of the hardware and software will only provide a fraction of it potential.<br /><br />With that, The Tao of Network Security Monitoring should be considered required reading for anyone using an IDS or responsible for its use.  If you have staff using an IDS, ensure that they have read The Tao of Network Security Monitoring as it will educate them in truly understanding how to monitor a network.e for its use.  If you have staff using an IDS, ensure that they have read The Tao of Network Security Monitoring as it will educate them in truly understanding how to monitor a network. <br />	2005-05-29

Millions of casual users find Google quite usable and helpful. Yet there are many who would like to take advantage of the full capabilities of Google. Once harnessed, Google becomes an even more invaluable and indispensable tool.<br /><br />Like an iceberg, there is a giant mass hidden beyond Google's simple interface. There are now more than 30 books on Google and two of the most beneficial ones are those that detail those hidden powers of Google, namely Google Hacks: Tips & Tools for Smarter Searching and Google Hacking for Penetration Testers. Rather than overlapping, these books are complementary and focus on different uses of Google.<br /><br />Google Hacks: Tips & Tools for Smarter Searching is helpful reference for any Google user who wants to get the most out of their searching experience. The book's 9 chapters detail 100 tips for different functionalities within Google. The bulk of the book is in the first 2 chapters, which contain 49 hacks for use of the basic Google Web interface. Hacks such as optimizing search entries, proximity searches, and Google Indexes are detailed. The book does a very good job in showing how to perform specific searches to glean the most-needed information.<br /><br />The other chapters detail how to optimize often less-used areas of Google including images, news, and groups, and Gmail (the Google mail application).<br /><br />Chapter 9, Programming Google, is valuable for programmers. The chapter details the use of the Google API (the collection of capabilities that Google exposes for use by third-party software).

The subtitle of Google Hacking for Penetration Testers is \\"Explore the Dark Side of Googling\\". The dark side of Google is that far too many networks are insecure with inadequate security and enable unauthorized information to leak into Google. This leakage creates the situation where significant amounts of password files, confidential information, and configuration data and much more are easily available.<br /><br />After reading Google Hacks: Tips & Tools for Smarter Searching, the real power and potential danger of Google is easily understood. Author Johnny Long details how penetration testers can harvest information that has been crawled by Google. The need for Google to be an integral part of any penetration test is now easily understood.<br /><br />In a similar manner, when Dan Farmer wrote SATAN in 1995, it was met with significant consternation in that many felt he was wrong to release such a powerful program into the wild. Silicon Graphics, his employer at the time, considered his conduct unprofessional and summarily fired him. Ironically, in 2005, a security administrator can be fired if they don't run a vulnerability scanner akin to SATAN. Running scanning tools is now part of security due diligence and any administrator not running such a tool is careless.<br /><br />With that, some may think author Johnny Long gives far too much ammunition to those seeking to peruse corporate data, but those were the same mistaken objections to SATAN. The book is not meant to be a crutch for script kiddies, its aim is rather to show how Google can be used to uncover data that most companies would rather remain secured. It is simply a matter of time until such Google searches will be considered due diligence for any basic security endeavor.<br /><br />The book's 12 chapters show how one can plunder and pillage corporate data via Google. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a basic introduction to Google searching, including building Google queries, URL and operator syntax, search reduction, and more.<br /><br />Chapters 3 through 10 detail the internals of Google hacking. The avenues of attack are nearly endless and various methods are detailed from traversal techniques, site crawling, tracking down Web server logins, and much more. With the sheer amount of data produced on corporate Web sites, it is hard not to have information leakage. The problem is that Google is the perfect glue to bond those disparate pieces of data together to form a dangerous set of connected data. Google is now gluing isolated data, which is dangerous data when in the wrong hands.<br /><br />Chapter 11 details what can be done to protect an organization from Google hackers. While author Johnny Long may be a hacker, he is quite mainstream when he writes that the best hardware and software configuration money can buy can't protect computing resources if an effective security policy is not in place. Long observes that a good security policy, when properly enforced, outlines the assets the organization is trying to protect, how the protection mechanisms are installed, the acceptable level of operational risk, and what do to in the event of a compromise or disaster.<br /><br />Chapter 11 details the use of the robots.txt file, which can be used to block Web crawlers such as Google. The chapter also recommends the use of various tools to secure an internal Web site. Tools from Foundstone are detailed, in addition to Gooscan, a tool created by Long that enables bulk Google searches to determine how much information has leaked.<br /><br />A decade ago, Google was the type of powerful search tool that was rumored to be used within the NSA. Today, petabytes of data are only a few clicks away on Google, and with the Google API, all of that information can be seamlessly integrated into a few scripts. The challenge companies face is to take security seriously and stop making it easy for their password files, payroll data, and other confidential information to be entered into Google's server farm.files, payroll data, and other confidential information to be entered into Google's server farm.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-29

It is evident that, prior to Windows XP Service Pack 2, the operating system was geared to file and printer sharing, not security. Among security professionals, the common view is that the best way to secure Windows is to use a more secure operating system such as Linux.<br /><br />Windows isn't going away, however, and probably millions of businesses will continue to use that platform. These systems should be hardened against attack, a task made easier by this resourceful and practical book.<br /><br />Hardening Windows Systems provides users a solid guide to implementing security on various Windows operating systems, attempting to close the many holes that have plagued Windows. Chapters cover infrastructure, physical security, communications, security policies, and more.<br /><br />Valuable security-setting tables and checklists are offered for a vast number of different Windows security services, settings, and parameters.

Where such shows deviate from reality is the unrealistic speed at which the actors are able to identify, apprehend and prosecute the perpetrators. In the real world, (unlike television, where the crime must be solved by the end of the family hour), crimes are solved with slow, deliberate and methodical steps. The prodigious incidence of digital crime has elevated computer forensics to a critical role within the field of information security. The focus of computer forensics is twofold: first is the attempt to determine whether a breach has occurred and to stop the perpetrator; second is prosecution of the offender, if the breach was a criminal activity.<br /><br />Security luminaries Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema wrote one of the first vulnerability scanners (SATAN) almost 10 years ago; SATAN was the precursor to ISS Scanner, Retina and nmap. Venema wrote such well-known security applications as the TCP Wrapper program and the Postfix mail server. Farmer and Venema's new book Forensic Discovery is a valuable book that grounds a computer-savvy reader in the world of digital forensics.<br /><br />An image of a pipe by artist Ren&eacute; Magritte is on the cover with the caption Ceci nest pas une pipe. (\\"This is not a Pipe.\\") The picture demonstrates that an object exists on many planes; the simple recognition of the picture initiates the belief that we are seeing something, but it is only known in representation. Surrealist painting and digital forensics coalesce in that the digital forensic investigator must think broadly and unconventionally in order to reconstruct an incident, all the time keeping in mind that often what initially seems obvious is neither real nor correct.<br /><br />The material in the book is an outgrowth of a one-time seminar the authors gave in 1999 on digital forensics and analysis. At the seminar, Farmer and Venema rolled out The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT), a collection of tools for gathering and analyzing forensic data on a Unix system. TCT is heavily referenced throughout the book.<br /><br />The book initially seems thin, at just 198 pages, but there is no filler and the information is presented in a fast and furious manner. Part one of the book comprises 35 pages and is an introduction to the foundations of digital forensics and what to look for in an digital investigation.<br /><br />Part two (chapters 3-6) is the nucleus of the book, which quickly gets into low-level details about file systems and operating system environments. While other forensics books focus exclusively on the discovery and gathering of data; Forensic Discovery adds needed insight on how to judge the trustworthiness of the observation and the data itself. Again, the idea is that not everything is as obvious as it may initially seem. An effective investigation often requires intense analysis, where meaningful conclusions take time.<br /><br />Chapter 4, \\"File System Analysis,\\" notes that while computers have significantly evolved since their inception, little has changed in last 30 years in the way that file systems actually handle data.<br /><br />Chapter 5, \\"Systems and Subversion,\\" is particularly interesting as it deals with system startup and shutdown, from a forensics perspective. The chapter shows that there are thousands of possible opportunities to subvert the integrity of a system without directly changing a file during startup and shutdown. A crucial decision that must be made during an incident is whether to shut down the system or let it remain on-line. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, and the book details them.<br /><br />Part three (chapters 7-8) is about the persistence of deleted file information. The authors' research reveals that data can be quite resistant to destruction. The book shows that a huge amount of data and metadata can survive intended deletion as well as accidental damage.<br /><br />ForensicDiscovery is unusual in that other books on forensics are often nothing more than checklists and step-by-step instructions on what to do during an incident. Forensic Discovery provides a broad framework on the nature of data and how it can be recovered for forensic purposes. By understanding the underlying operating system, the act of analyzing and dealing with a security breach becomes much easier.<br /><br />The book's target reader is anyone who wants to deepen his understanding of how computer systems work, as well as anyone who is likely to become involved with the technical aspects of computer intrusion or system analysis. The topics are too advanced, to make it the right book for the novice system administrator. For the technical reader, though, Forensic Discovery is one of the best computer security books published in the last year. The value of the information is immense, and the extensive experience that the authors bring is unmatched.r />Forensic Discovery is unusual in that other books on forensics are often nothing more than checklists and step-by-step instructions on what to do during an incident.

Since the start of the Palestinian intifada in October 2000, combined with the meltdown of the NASDAQ, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost in Israel.  With a population of only 6.2 million, these lost jobs have had a catastrophic effect on the Israeli economy.<br /><br />As a management consultant, Carrison wondered how any company, let a lone an entire economy could survive in an environment ravaged by terrorism and a recession.  The Israeli economy faced a double-edged sword with the meltdown of the hi-tech industry (in which Israel is heavily leveraged) and the intifada, which started in October 2001.<br /><br />Carrison questioned from a business perspective how businesses in Israel were able to stay viable in such a chaotic and destructive environment.  His conclusions, after spending time in Israel and interviewing many business leaders there, is that even with all of the terrorism, the Israeli economy is surprisingly robust.<br /><br />Without getting in the politics of the middle-east conflict, nor taking sides, the book shows both technology and business managers how they can deal with the most adverse of situations.<br /><br />In the book, Carrison interviews a cross section of CEO's and managers from industries hurt the hardest; namely tourism, hotel, hi-tech and biotech.  What is unique from all of the stories is that every manager has stated that not only has the intifada not destroyed their company, it has made it a leaner and more efficient organizations and one that will be ready to go into overdrive when the normal economic times resume.<br /><br />The five chapters have the same format, interviews with CEO's and senior directors, and a checklist for managing a business under fire.  Each interviewee offers their own observations and strategies on how to deal with the current situation and work towards future growth.  These strategies run from redefining the market, sharing the risk, to contingency plans and more.<br /><br />One significant difference noted between Israel and America is how Israeli citizens psychologically deal with terrorism.  In an interview with financial consultant Danny Halpern, he questions that if the World Trade Center in New York City were completely rebuilt and reopened tomorrow, how many people would rent office space in it?  Halpern doubts the World Trade Center would have the same occupancy level as before 9/11.  But he notes that in Israel, office are repopulated after they are bombed, and customers frequent bombed cafes and restaurants as soon as they are repaired.<br /><br />Another telling difference that Halpern observed is that in Israel is more concerned with the quality of security, whereas in the US, more is invested into the mechanics of security.  In the US, because of the huge numbers involved, the investment in security by default is in the mechanics, and the system.  With that, minimum wage workers are hired to carry out what are supposedly important security functions.<br /><br />One area hit the hardest has been the hotel industry.  Hotels operate with a large amount of staff and require high occupancy rates to break even (roughly 75 percent).  Carrison interviewed a number of hotel managers who saw their occupancy rate average about 25 percent.  By any account, every hotel should have closed its doors and declared bankruptcy.  But what happened is that the hotels discovered many inefficiencies.  In fact, Raphy Weiner, General Manager of the five-star Daniel Hotel, noted that he learned how inefficient they were before the crisis and \\"we'll never go back to the old way.  The intifada has been a school for us\\".<br /><br />The lessons that American IT managers can take from Weiner are that even the most adverse situations can be a fulcrum for change.  Those that are in danger of having their job outsourced, which is a significant number of us, can take those lessons to heart, and hope that their managers and CEO's are also.<br /><br />The findings Carrison found were that every manager had been challenged in cataclysmic ways, but refused to be run out of business by terrorists.  Their defiance to the terrorists enabled them to create ways to streamline operations, reduce staff and determine a method to ride out the economic storm.  What is ironic, is that in interview after interview, every manager and CEO stated that the current times has made them better overall and will maximize their long-term survival.<br /><br />A further cruel irony detailed in the book is that the ones that have heavily hurt from an economic perspective are the many Palestinian workers who before the intifada started, were able to have a good job.  The severe cutbacks in many firms resulted in Palestinian workers losing their jobs as a direct result of terrorist activities by their compatriots.<br /><br />While the cause of the Israeli programmer losing his job is not the same as that of the American programmer; the manner in which they both can rebuild can be the same.  Nietzsche's observation that \\"what does not destroy me, makes me stronger\\" is the literal sediment in interview after interview in the book.  There is a lot that American programmers and managers can learn, from those under fire in Israel.n take from Weiner are that even the most adverse situations can be a fulcrum for change.

These chapters and much of the rest of the book delve deeply into the \\"C\\" programming language, so basic familiarity with that language is highly recommended.<br /><br />Ensuing chapters go from the network layer to various software platforms, detailing the precise steps that an attacker will take to enter a network or software application. The vulnerabilities are clearly defined, but the book really shines when it provides detailed instructions on how systems can be protected.<br /><br />Security Warrior is written for advanced system administrators charged with network or system security. Corporate security professionals may be intimidated by the book, but they would do well to get a copy to the appropriate person in their organization. That would be the proactive thing to do.	2005-01-03

Author Edward Yourdon's premise is that outsourcing is not going to disappear anytime soon, and -- given the success that many companies have begun enjoying during the past few years -- it is not likely to level off anytime soon. Outsourcing is now a mainstream phenomenon and is affecting more and more workers, in nearly every knowledge-based sector. In a nutshell, this is Yourdon's book of how to prepare yourself for the inevitable.\\"<br /><br />For those Americans who would hope their representatives in Washington would get involved and pass laws to stem the flow of jobs overseas, there is little that Washington will likely do to help knowledge-based workers whose jobs are in danger of being offshored. While the loss of jobs is a crisis to many of us, Yourdon makes note of the oil crisis of the early 1970s and a speech that Jimmy Carter made in April 1977. Carter said \\"If we fail to act soon we will face an economic, social and political crisis that will threaten our free institutions.\\" Nearly 30 years after Carter made that speech, oil is at an all-time high and nothing has been significantly done to reduce our dependency on oil; or to find a better solution.<br /><br />If Congress is apathetic when it comes to an effective energy policy that affects an entire nation, it is clear that preserving the jobs of C and Java programmers is likely to be at the bottom of any congressman's to-do list. In 2005, national security, Medicare and Iraq are just a few of the issues that seem to be far more pressing to the nation than the loss of programmers.<br /><br />The book is written about outsourcing in general, but has a heavy slant to programmers whose jobs have been outsourced to India. The prime advantage India has over other countries with cheap labor is a large base of workers that speak English. While the salaries in China, for example, are even lower than in India, the language barrier is significant.<br /><br />The main claims of proponents of outsourcing are of increased productivity and major cost savings. Whether these claims are real is to a degree immaterial, as the perception among CIOs is that outsourcing has an immediate cost savings. This is primarily due to the fact that the salaries and benefit costs of overseas programmers are radically less than those of their U.S. counterparts.<br /><br />From a productivity and efficiency perspective, many Indian firms are CMM level-5 certified, something that their U.S. counterparts can't attest to. At the end of the day, is better and cheaper code produced in Bangalore and Mumbai? Yourdon states that it is hard to find hard and fast answers. But with outsourcing the rage, there is the perception that Indian firms are more productive, formalized and efficient than their US counterparts is being accepted as fact. For many, perception is reality, and the reality is that jobs are being sent overseas by the thousands.<br /><br />Outsource:Competing in the Global Productivity Race is written for (and beneficial to) anyone who feels that his job may be in danger of being outsourced. The book is well-written and pragmatic, and Yourdon notes that there are no simple answers to be found, nor are there any obvious choices. The book guides the reader who is working in a knowledge-based position to better determine where the trends in outsourcing are going and how to best save their job and simultaneously prepare for the inevitable. It is not that every knowledge-based job will be outsourced, but rather that the potential exists that every job could be outsourced. With that, it behooves everyone to get make sure they are prepared.<br /><br />In 1992, Yourdon wrote Decline and Fall of the American Programmer. In the book, he predicted that U.S. programmers would \\"suffer the fate of the Dodo bird\\" as companies shifted jobs from American workers to those overseas to take advantage of lower pay, less labor regulations and higher productivity. Yourdon admits his prediction was partially incorrect. U.S. programmers have not gone the way of the Dodo bird and hiring is resuming; but in spite of everything, huge numbers of jobs are being sent overseas.<br /><br />While Decline and Fall of the American Programmer was focused exclusively on technology workers, Yourdon writes that every knowledge-based job is vulnerable to being outsourced. From radiologists to tax preparers, telemarketers to architects, and more.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest benefit of Outsource is the composed manner in which Yourdon writes. Outsourcing is a controversial, political and extremely emotional topic, and Yourdon provides a balanced view of the outsourcing phenomena.<br /><br />One of the solutions suggested to stemming the flow of jobs overseas is protectionist federal regulations. Yourdon believes that such measures are doomed to fail, in that you can't protect knowledge-based worked in the same way that steel and agriculture products can be protected. Yourdon admits that there might be some short-term benefits to a protectionist strategy, but will fail in the long-term. His view is that protectionism is simply blaming someone else for the existence of competition; and such an approach does not solve the problem. His solution, and the overall advice in the book, is to make each and every American knowledge worker more prepared to face competition from overseas.<br /><br />Of the books 10 chapters, the most compelling is chapter 6, which provides seven strategies in which to deal with the threat of outsourcing. The first is to be proactive, with the last being to consider a career change. Yourdon does not promise and secrets or miracles in the chapter and attempts to provide some common, yet often overlooked, sense.<br /><br />Outsource ends with the following quote: \\"I was taught very early that I would have to depend entirely upon myself; that my future lay in my own hands.\\" This book shows you how.take advantage of lower pay, less labor regulations and higher productivity.

Computer forensics are a different matter altogether. Given the unglamorous technical work involved, is there little wonder that prime-time television does not air a show called Computer Forensic Geeks? While not ideal material for adaptation into a prime-time drama, Software Forensics: Collecting Evidence from the Scene of a Digital Crime enlightens the reader by providing a pretty good high-level introduction to the core concepts of computer software forensics.<br /><br />Author Robert Slade mines solid detail, including listing specific software tools that can be used to identify and track virus creators, however unlikely corporate America might be to invest resources for such an effort. Slade discusses legal rules of evidence and emphasizes the importance of keeping evidence pristine so that its veracity is unshakable.<br /><br />As a high-level introduction, the book is a good choice.

Far too few organizations know the inherent risks involved with outsourcing security, and don't properly investigate what they are getting into. The same company that makes it nearly impossible for an employee to enter the office supply closet to get much needed toner cartridge will outsource their intrusion detection, email and firewall systems without a blink.<br /><br />One of the many reasons companies turn to security outsourcing and managed security services providers (MSSP) is to use their limited internal security staff for more interesting areas such as web development, VPN and e-commerce applications. They will then outsource the boring activities such as firewall and IDS monitoring and maintenance to a MSSP.<br /><br />Given that activities such as firewall monitoring and administering an IDS in large enterprise requires 24/7 support, it is not unusual for a company to want to outsource such activities; monitoring and administering are not core functions of most organizations.<br /><br />The trouble comes from the lack of due care often given to choosing a MSSP. With that, Outsourcing Information Security is a long-overdue book that asks the questions that are necessary before an organization decides to outsource any information security function.<br /><br />The author's general tone is against the outsourcing of information security; but provides readers with the various benefits and risks involved in outsourcing security, and let's them ultimate decide if outsourcing security is right for their organization. It is the reader who must define, evaluate and manage those risks and determine if outsourcing is a viable solution. These include technology, business and legal risks.<br /><br />The book comprises nine chapters and three appendices totaling a bit under 250 pages. The first two chapters provide a good introduction to and overview of outsourcing and information security, and the associated security risks.<br /><br />Chapter 3 details various reasons why outsourcing information security makes sense. The chapter includes various tables and references to the many reasons why a company would want to outsource security.<br /><br />Chapter 4 takes the other side and analyzes the risks of outsourcing. The chapter details the traditional risks, in addition to other factors such as hidden costs, broken promises, phantom benefits and more. The book shows that while many organizations hand over information security responsibility to their MSSP, when things go wrong, they can't effectively blame the MSSP. When things go wrong -- and they will -- all of the fingers in the world can be pointed at the MSSP, but the ultimate responsibility falls on the organization itself. With outsourced security, if something goes wrong, those fingers will point back to the company's security manager, not the incompetent firewall administrator in Bangalore.<br /><br />The chapter provides a balanced look at the risk of outsourcing, and while calm in its overall approach, the chapter should at least make the person considering outsourcing information security think twice. In fact, the author concludes the chapter by stating \\"when all of the risks of outsourcing are considered, one wonders how anyone ever makes the decision to use a third party.\\" Nonetheless, there is plenty of evidence that many security activities are indeed outsourced to MSSP, and are often satisfactory from both the buyer's and seller's perspective.<br /><br />Chapters 5 and 6 provide a thorough summary of the costs and benefits of outsourcing, and provides a method with which to categorize them. The chapter is well suited for a CFO with its discussion of direct vs. indirect costs, controllable vs. non-controllable costs, and much more. These two chapters show that creating meaningful financial numbers to see if outsourcing makes financial sense is not such an easy task. It is important to understand that outsourcing sometimes makes financial sense, but certainly not all the time. For those organizations that don't crunch the numbers seriously at the beginning, these costs can later come back to haunt them in a big way.<br /><br />Chapters 7 and 8 detail the processes involved in commencing an outsourcing project, from requirements gathering to placing policy against the outsourced company. A mistake many organizations make is failure to ensure that the MSSP is abiding by the client's information security policies, rather than their own.<br /><br />Similarly, one of the most overlooked areas of outsourcing information security functionality is regulation. A U.S. company may be under numerous regulations, from HIPAA to Sarbanes-Oxley, GLBA, SEC and more; when they outsource their security functionality, the remote technician may not be under the jurisdiction of the SEC; but the corporate data still must be protected according to those regulations.<br /><br />The main part of the book concludes with chapter 9, which provides a 20-step process to determine if an outsourced security solution is appropriate. In seven pages, the author specifies the various events, tasks and steps that make up the typical outsourcing project.<br /><br />Appendix A provides a breakdown of the various services that can be outsourced, with Appendices B & C providing brief histories of IT Outsourcing and Information Security.<br /><br />The only downside to the book is its $85.00 price, which is at the high-end for technology and business books. While the price is high, the book is a huge value for anyone considering outsourcing security. The book asks the questions that are often never asked, and details how the outsourcing of information security is not the slam-dunk that the MSSPs often portray it to be.<br /><br />For those who know what their security issues are and look to outsource their security functionality to a trusted MSSP, Outsourcing Information Security shows how it can be done. On the other side, for those who are drunk with the panacea that outsourcing security is supposed to provide, Outsourcing Information Security will be a sobering wake-up call.e is not such an easy task.

Similarly, securing a global enterprise network is quite different than computer security for a smaller organization.  With that Computer Security for the Home and Small Office provides a good overview to the core areas of information security.<br /><br />Most small businesses don't have staff with adequate computer security skills at their disposal, and as a result, their computer systems are most often at risk.  Novice hackers will target such networks as a stepping stone, before moving on to larger, more secured corporate systems.<br /><br />The book is technical in nature, but quite decipherable for the reader without a strong background in computers and security.  In plain English, the book details not only potential security threats, but tips on how to avoid them and recover from them.<br /><br />The seven chapter of the  book cover important security topics such as firewalls, Internet browsers, Windows & Linux security, email and spam, viruses and worms, network hardening, and more.<br /><br />Chapter 3 discusses social engineering, which is of special interest to everyone, especially small businesses.  Security technology can only help so much.  But all of the hardware and software in the world will never be able to defend against an attack made through an unsuspecting user via social engineering.<br /><br />The book provides a lot of extra background material on security that elucidates the reader, and let's them better understand the real threats that are facing their systems.  By better understanding the threats, the reader can more effectively secure their systems.<br /><br />Computer Security for the Home and Small Office demystifies many murky security concepts and shows the reader that they can secure their computer systems without an engineering degree.	2004-11-05

Despite its title, this book is not another one. Equal parts autobiography, mystery, biography, and action thriller, the book is an overview of the cases and characters with which the author, a forensic investigator at Deloitte and Touche, has been involved.<br /><br />In chapter after chapter, the reader receives a high-level view of the tools and technologies used in forensic investigations, then learns the inner workings of specific corporate frauds. These cases range from garden-variety frauds to cybercrime.<br /><br />One fascinating chapter explores the disposition of a bank account dormant since the Holocaust and how forensic investigators cracked the case 60 years after the fact. It describes how a large group of investigators went to Switzerland to determine the beneficiaries of dormant World War II-era Swiss bank accounts. The chapter details methodology used to retrieve documents and to discover what was hidden and who was entitled to it.<br /><br />Geared for management-level readers without much technical background, the book spares the reader byte-by-byte details on forensic evidence gathering and handling. Story after story gives readers a very accessible account of how investigators detected fraud, misuse, and a wide range of other corporate criminality. With its real-life drama, the book is both an enjoyable and instructive read.	2004-11-01

When designing and security a network, it is the job of the security architect to maximize that level of improbability as much as possible. Anyone who makes their network even a little bit more security resilient will quickly find a drop in the number of security breaches.<br /><br />The publication of Hacking Exposed a few years ago started a new era in books about network scanning. Hacking Exposed was the first popular book that detailed how to go about performing a penetration test. In a similar vein, NSA is comparable to Hacking Exposed in that it provides a framework for doing security assessments. The big difference is that NSA provides a much more structured approach to performing the assessment, whereas Hacking Exposed lacked that formal approach. Hacking Exposed also goes into more details in many areas, and its initial title has morphed into many other different titles.<br /><br />This more formal approach is manifest in the books 14 chapters. The first two chapters of NSA start out with the fundamental need and requirements for performing a network security assessment, and then details the tools and methodologies required to bring that assessment to fruition.<br /><br />Chapter 3 details the ins and outs of network enumeration and also shows how to use standard utilities such as whois and nmap for network enumeration. Perhaps one of the most beneficial features of the book is the selection of countermeasures that are found at the end of each chapter. These countermeasures are very useful in ensuring that any vulnerabilities are appropriately fixed.<br /><br />Besides listing methods which an intruder might use to elude common security applications, the book also goes into numerous hacking tools. While some may see this as providing fuel to the fire, it is clear that the tools are readily available (and have been for years). Listing of such tools won't make hacking easier for miscreants and script kiddies; rather it provides a level playing field for systems administrators who need to defend against such hackers.<br /><br />After network and host enumeration, NSA steps forward into topics such as dealing with web servers and CGI, remote access issues, and ftp and database security issues. Chapter 9 does a good job of focusing on Microsoft Windows security issues. While entire books have been written about weak Windows security protocols such as NetBIOS, SMB and CIFS, NSA does a good job encapsulating ways to keep vulnerabilities here in check. Readers are highly advised to put the Windows networks services countermeasures listed at the end of the chapter into use.<br /><br />Chapters 10-12 deal with the myriad security issues with email, VPN and RPC issues. While most of the information in these chapters (and the book as a whole) has been elucidated elsewhere, there is nonetheless a lot of valuable information contained in the chapters.<br /><br />Chapter 13, \\"Application-Level Risks,\\" is important in that many organizations put far too much emphasis on security the perimeter and forgetting about the application. The need for more emphasis on application-level security is eloquently put by Marcus Ranum when he notes that \\"these days, with the kind of plug-ins that come in your typical browser, combined with all the bizarre undocumented protocols used by new Internet applications, make it highly unlikely that a firewall is doing anything more complex than a thin layer of policy atop routing. As such, the applications behind the firewall are now more critical to security than the firewall itself. Which should scare the holey moley out of you.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 14 closes the book with a methodology for running a network security assessment. The author notes that running an assessment requires more thought than simply running security tools in ahaphazard manner.<br /><br />Overall, Network Security Assessment provides a good framework for anyone who is serious about running network security scans to security his perimeter and interior networks. The book is written in a style that is readable and understandable style; while more of an introductory text, it does not treat the reader as a dummy.<br /><br />When it comes to running a network security assessment, the methodology is often more important than the running of the tools. While there is nothing radically new detailed in NSA, it does provide an effective and comprehensive overview of the issues involved in only 355 pages. If you are looking for a to-the-point book that does not get bogged down with screen prints and meaningless hacker stories and myths, Network Security Assessment is a good place to start.n assessment requires more thought than simply running security tools in a haphazard manner. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, Network Security Assessment provides a good framework for anyone who is serious about running network security scans to security his perimeter and interior networks.

The company will do anything and everything it can to ensure that Davis provides positive testimony. Advice will stop at nothing to complete their mission; that means they'll engage in multiple murders, kidnapping and a slew of other nefarious activities. All of this is addition to simultaneously attempting to corner the video chip market, and create video drivers that send subliminal messages about which candidate to vote for.<br /><br />As Albert Einstein said, \\"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.\\" The plot could have been made much simpler to mimic reality and the current state of insecure e-voting systems. As in real life, the e-voting companies are getting away with providing insecure e-voting systems; under the nose of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and an unsuspecting and apathetic voting public. The idea that an e-voting software company would resort to murder is where the book demonstrates it is a novel.<br /><br />The reason e-voting companies and their insecure software can run roughshod through the FEC is that voting-system flaws do not have the same immediate tragic consequences that other product failures can. Plane crashes and adverse drug effects spur the FAA and FDA to take drastic actions and often overreact to an event; poorly written and insecure voting software is clearly not as newsworthy as a burning jet.<br /><br />Combine this with a public that is utterly apathetic to voting in general and the situation is ripe for the situation where e-voting can have a near hypnotic effect on most people involved. Because voter turnout for U.S. presidential elections is quite low (60% of eligible voters cast their ballots in the November 2000 presidential election), and most people are completely unaware of the dangers of insecure voting applications, an under-funded federal agency can be manipulated by the e-voting vendors to roll out insecure voting software.<br /><br />The international intrigue of the novel takes the reader to the RSA security conference in Amsterdam, where Davis is given a cryptic CD-ROM by Baff Lexicon, a notorious international hacker. Lexicon suggests there is serious problems with the software and will brief Davis at midnight that night at the Amsterdam Hard Rock Cafe on the details. Unfortunately, Lexicon is being trailed by undercover agents from Advice, and is murdered a few hours later by a Yugoslavian hit man that the company seems to have on retainer.<br /><br />Davis now has the difficult job of unlocking the cryptic information on the CD-ROM on his own. That same CD-ROM is included with the book, and the reader is invited to join Davis in attempting to decrypt the contents of the CD and the conspiracy that Advice Software is attempting to perpetrate; namely the outcome of the 2004 election.<br /><br />(If you are not interested in buying the book, anyone can download the software without having to buy the book. The software is actually part of a contest and the winner will receive a free pass to the BlackHat 2005 conference.)<br /><br />A good section of the novel then details how Davis attempts to decipher the secrets that Baff Lexicon was attempting to convey to him. The two authors of The Mezonic Agenda have, respectively, a PhD in applied mathematics and a Master's in chemical engineering, and write in a someone choppy style representative of their technical backgrounds. Occasional errors in grammar and spelling are excused, save for the egregious misspelling of Learjet on page 154.<br /><br />The story concludes with a moral dilemma that Davis faces: with his wife and daughter kidnapped by the Advice Software hit man, does he provide favorable, yet dishonest testimony about the software and watch his family set free; or tell the truth and watch them die?<br /><br />The novel itself takes up 240 of the books 370 pages, with the last five parts dedicated to a history of voting, reverse engineering, cryptography, buffer overflows and steganography.<br /><br />As a standalone novel, the book (while entertaining and enjoyably readable) is somewhat overpriced at $34.95, especially since the enclosed CD-ROM is freely downloadable and the plot is somewhat thin. The non-fiction final section, though, is quite informative and effectively complements the novel.<br /><br />This novel does a good job of explaining how software can be cracked, and provides the reader with a good overview of security concepts such as buffer overflows, reverse engineering, cryptography, and more. It is hoped that the book will find itself in the hands of members of Congress and the FEC, who truly need to be educated in such fundamental security topics.<br /><br />As a novel, The Mezonic Agenda will not compete with books from Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum.

Hacking for Dummies is written on the premise that to catch a hacker, you have to think and behave like one. This is a well-written and engrossing book that helps the reader understand how hackers compromise computer systems and networks. Its clear, easy-to-read style won't intimidate readers unfamiliar with abstruse security terms and concepts.<br /><br />The 19 chapters progress from the basics of security to the hardening of an operating system and the hacking of Web applications. While the reader is not expected to have a deep technical background, the book does go into some detail, as it must to provide a hands-on approach. For a high-level theoretical approach to network defense, look elsewhere. This is a down-and-dirty tool for ensuring that the organization's systems and network are secure.	2004-09-03

Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage	Books	2	22	29	N	N	Excellent questions with inferior answers	`Does IT Matter' is a difficult book to rate.  As to the questions it raises, it deserves 5 stars.  But its answers, are two-star, at best.<br />By way of analogy, most bomb threats are bogus, but each one must be treated as if it were genuine. With that, in his new book Does IT Matter?, Nicholas Carr throws a bomb, and it turns out to be a dud.<br />Carr's book is an outgrowth of his article &quot;IT Doesn't Matter,&quot; which appeared in the May 2003 issue of the Harvard Business Review. His hypothesis is that the strategic importance of IT has diminished. Carr views IT as a commodity, akin to electricity.<br />He also compares IT to the railroad infrastructure. In the early days, railroads that had their own tracks had a huge advantage, but once the rails become ubiquitous and open, that advantage went away.<br />Carr feels that since all companies can purchase the same hardware and software, any strategic advantage is obviated. It's true that the core functions of IT (processing, network transport, storage, etc.) are affordable and available to all, but there's still huge strategic advantage to be gained in how they're implemented.<br />It's much like two airlines that purchase the same model of airplane. If one airline streamlines and optimizes operations, trains its staff and follows standard operating procedures, it can expect to make a profit. If the other has operational inefficiencies, labor problems and other setbacks, it could lose money. The airplane is identical, but the outcome is not.<br />Carr is correct in that there have been some huge IT outlays of dubious value. But to say that IT is simply the procurement of hardware and software is to be blind to the fact that hardware and software are but two of the myriad components of IT.<br />To use the railroad metaphor, hardware and off-the-shelf software are the rails of IT; how they are designed and implemented is what provides their strategic value. Carr views IT as completely evolved. But the reality is that although IT has matured, it still is in a growth mode. The IT of today is vastly different from the IT of both 1999 and 2009.<br />Carr's view that most innovations within IT will tend to enhance the reliability and efficiency of IT rather than provide a competitive advantage is in direct opposition to what is said by every CIO I have met.e reality is that although IT has matured, it still is in a growth mode.

They help ensure that key issues aren't overlooked, and they serve as guideposts for anyone auditing the work. This book provides technology managers with a very good preparatory set of details and checklists for their e-commerce infrastructure. The book can also show a corporate auditor what to look for to ensure that appropriate controls are in place.<br />Throughout its 6 chapters and 225 pages, the book offers a detailed, progressive, and structured approach for performing such audits. The book addresses technology-related issues but doesn't require the auditor to be expert in them. Among topics discussed are physical security, authentication, and passwords; checklists ensure that these features are deployed or configured correctly.<br />For ensuring that file servers and other elements of the e-commerce infrastructure are protected, this book is an excellent choice.	2004-07-02

For all its bulk and valuable reference information, however, it glaringly lacks operations-type material.<br />The first 19 chapters (and 700 pages) discuss technologies such as firewalls and VPNs. While these are well written, there is nothing here that hasn't been published before; all of the information is easily accessible via the Internet for free.<br />The final several hundred pages duplicate freely available government information. One is left wondering why the authors felt the need, for example, to include all 257 pages of the Federal Search and Seizure Manual here. Anyone can find it on the U.S. Department of Justice's Web site and search it electronically.<br />At $95, this book is a pricey substitute for information easily obtainable from the Web.

But most books about J2EE have not given enough depth to its security features.<br />Enterprise Java 2 Security: Building Secure and Robust J2EE Applications gives J2EE software developers a great reference to use in building secure Java applications.<br />Chapters 1 and 2 provide a methodical overview of the underlying Java technology and the security functionality.  The rest of the chapters provide a comprehensive synopsis of all of the J2EE security features including JCA, JSE, SSL hooks, JSSE and more.<br />The books strong point is that it covers all of the core security features and provides excellent sample code.<br />The only drawback to the book is that it is light on real-world examples of J2EE security.  It is heavy on the `about' aspect, but light on the `how' side of things.  It would have also been helpful if there would be an accompanying web site where code samples could have been provided.<br />Overall, Enterprise Java 2 Security: Building Secure and Robust J2EE Applications is a solid reference for all of the major J2EE security topics.	2004-04-22

Similarly, in the information security space, many people have heard of regulations such as Common Criteria, ISO-17799 and HIPAA. Yet there is a huge regulation that many people know nothing of, namely 21 CFR Part 11.<br />Title 21 Part 11 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (also known as 21 CFR Part 11 or simply Part 11) falls under the authority of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA felt that the risks of falsification, misinterpretation and change without leaving evidence are higher with electronic records than paper records and therefore specific controls are required.<br />Part 11 deals with the conditions under which the FDA will accept electronic records and electronic signatures as equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures and electronic New Drug Application (NDA) submissions as equivalent to paper submission.<br />With that, 21 CFR Part 11: Complete Guide to International Computer Validation is a very good overview of the topic.<br />The book details how organizations regulated by Part 11 can create a compliance strategy for validated systems.<br />Anyone needing a quick introduction to Part 11 will find this work valuable.<br />The only negative to this book is its price; at $180.00, it is extremely expensive.  Such a price will make the book unobtainable for most readers.  I believe its low Amazon.com Sales Rank of 1,810,979 is due directly to that.	2004-04-22

Two notable examples are Martin Luther's \\"95 Theses\\" criticizing the Catholic Church, which began the Reformation, and Ralph Nader's denunciation of the auto industry with \\"Unsafe at Any Speed.\\" An indictment of the software industry and its indifference to writing secure software hasbeen published in \\"Building Secure Software: How to Avoid Security Problems the Right Way\\" by John Viega and Gary McGraw.<br />Twenty years into the client-server revolution, and a decade into the Internet revolution, it's a measure of inadequacy of secure coding that only now are the first books being written on how to secure software -- the very foundation of information systems.<br />Software developers who code without taking security into consideration are potentially as dangerous as a physician prescribing a drug without knowing its side effects. As a society, we should tolerate neither.<br />While security products such as firewalls, encryption devices, event monitoring and intrusion-detection systems are needed to secure networks; it must not be forgotten that behind every security problem is a common enemy -- insecurely written software.<br />Building secure software is not rocket science. Writing secure code doesn't mean turning every developer into a world-class cryptographer. It simply means training them in the fundamentals of how software works, including security. If corporate end users can betrained not to send inappropriate (sexist, racist, confidential, etc.) e-mail via corporate servers, then software developers can certainly be trained to write secure software programs.<br />The revolution needed in software development is to integrate security into software engineering. The current approach in software is to patch problems after they occur. In fact, 2003 saw the rise of many patch management companies; a sector that only came to be recently. Endless patching is a downward spiral that only serves to treat the symptoms, not the true problem, and only in a reactive manner. Had those same programmers been trained in writing secure code, much of the problems would have been obviated and billions of dollars saved in the interim.<br />It's all the rage to send development offshore in the name of saving money. If companies understood how much more money could be saved by building secure software from the get-go, rather than bolting security on as an afterthought; wouldn't they do the same?<br />It's frightening to think that in just a matter of years, everything but the food we eat will have an IP address attached to it. When the time comes that your family vacation commences with a flight on a pilot-less airplane, here's hoping the developers of the navigation and control systems knew the rudiments of writing secure software.not the true problem, and only in a reactive manner.

In a crowded market of computer security titles, a niche exists for a book that lays out wireless security problems and couples them with solutions.<br />Unfortunately, this is not that book. While well written, the book is thin on security matters; security is only first dealt with in chapter six. That coverage is interrupted by five chapters on building wireless networks. Discussion of security doesn't resume until chapter twelve.<br />Despite its title, the book is more about setting up, configuring, and managing wireless networks, with occasional digressions into security issues. Only about 35 pages of this 320-page book directly deal with wireless security. The book would make a good introduction for designing wireless networks, but it falls short as a security reference.	2004-03-01

Examples include Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speed; these books are timeless in their influence. The Myth of Homeland Security by noted information security consultant Marcus Ranum (also known as the father of the firewall) has an equally ominous message and deserves equal attention. Like Unsafe at Any Speed, Ranum's book should serve as a fulcrum for change.<br />Essentially, Ranum makes the point that buying duct tape by the mile and having elderly women remove their shoes at airports does absolutely nothing to increase homeland security. Ranum details other flaws in the government's approach to counter terrorism, including the huge bureaucracies that exist primarily for the purpose of prolonging their existence. He notes that the very structure of bureaucracies rewards inefficiencies and encourages territorialism and turf warfare. Want proof? More than two years after 9-11, the CIA and FBI still do not have a streamlined method for interdepartmental communications.<br />Throwing money (to the tune of tens of billions of dollars) at the problem without first identifying the solutions certainly are not the way to go. So what should we do?<br />First, as Ranum notes, we must get practical. From a physical security perspective, it is hard enough to secure a mega-mall with a few hundred stores and tens of thousands of customers. The task is exponentially more difficult, if not impossible, when extended to an entire country spanning millions of square miles of land, including long, unsecured borders, and inhabited by hundreds of millions of both permanent and transient, legal and illegal persons, with more entering daily.<br />Compounding the challenge of this complex and multifaceted task is the government's penchant for creating and sustaining bureaucracies without regard for whether they make getting the job done easier. For example, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), admits that it can't account for nearly a half-million visitors to this country.<br />Given the agency's poor performance historically, it should have been completely dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up. Instead, it was given a new name. If BCIS were a public company, its top management would have been fired long ago. Thus, the second step toward better homeland security would be more accountability for officials spearheading government programs.<br />Another issue that complicates the challenge of homeland security is that the average citizen simply does not understand risk, notes Ranum. As a result, most people will overreact to isolated incidents, such as occurred with the Washington, D.C., area sniper, while ignoring threats with a much higher probability of affecting them, such as cancer from smoking or a serious car accident from drunk driving.<br />Media coverage that reduces complex issues to sound bites certainly does not help. But even the authorities, who surely do not get their information from media sound bites, seem not to take a big-picture, long-term view. For example, when a shoe-bomber attempted to take down an airliner with a shoe-based bomb attack, security services started making all passengers take off their shoes before embarking.<br />Is this an effective way to deal with the overall risk? No. As Ranum notes, just imagine if this terrorist had stored his bomb in his underwear.<br />To address this problem, the third step toward better homeland security would be for officials to take a more professional approach to risk assessment and for security professionals in government and in private industry to work together to educate the public about proper risk assessment and risk management.<br />A fourth issue that must be addressed is the government's inability to solve problems expeditiously once theyhave been identified. One has to wonder, says Ranum, why Amazon.com can grow from a garage to an e-commerce powerhouse in a matter of months, yet CIA and FBI databases still can't effectively share information with each other more than two years after 9-11. A laundry list of other security problems at government agencies has been repeatedly cited by General Accounting Office reports without the problems being addressed.<br />Moreover, for homeland security to work, agencies such as INS/BCIS, FBI, CIA, and even the NSA all have to work together. News reports suggest that the FBI and CIA are still not cooperating to the degree they should.<br />Then, of course, there is the issue of the insider threat. Even if we permanently sealed our borders, there would be serious risks to homeland security, notes Ranum. Nefarious individuals such as Timothy McVeigh, Aldrich Ames, and Robert Hanssen were all Americans, in some cases with security clearances. In a democracy, there is no easy solution to this problem.<br />Homeland security is so big that it may be inherently unsolvable. Yet it is a risk that must be managed. That means government needs to find a reasonable level of countermeasures to establish a reasonable level of security. Instead, it continues to suggest to the American people that a few billion dollars and a reshuffling of the bureaucracy can solve the problem.<br />Overall, Ranum does an excellent job of showing what is right and wrong about homeland security issues.  The only time the author blunders, is when he takes a somewhat overly simplistic view of the Middle East crisis, and makes some unreasonable comparisons.<br />The 9-11 attacks started a giant wheel moving, and that wheel's name is the Department of Homeland Security. The Jungle ushered in a new era within the meatpacking industry, while Unsafe at Any Speed fundamentally changed Detroit, and saved tens of thousands of lives in the process. If The Myth of Homeland Security has but a hundredth of the impact, and if it does nothing more than get the FBI and CIA to work better together, then maybe homeland security won't be a myth after all.once they have been identified.

But the protection could be for naught if the same data is transferred to a personal digital assistant (PDA), which often is overlooked when security is considered. PDA Security: Incorporating Handhelds into the Enterprise trumpets the importance of PDA security and guides system administrators through protective measures.<br />When PDAs first appeared commercially, their capabilities were limited and their risks minimal. Today's PDAs have scores of megabytes of memory and well-developed networking capabilities, making them as important to protect as PCs and laptops.<br />PDA Security is valuable for corporate system administrators who need a PDA-protection architecture for their organizations. The book provides tactics on how to deploy, manage, and secure PDAs in the workplace.<br />Section one of the book offers a comprehensive introduction to PDA technology and security, with sections two and three exploring security mechanisms and strategies such as cryptography in greater detail. The book is not designed for end users; its information is far too technical for the casual PDA user. But administrators who must support and secure many PDAs will find a good resource here.	2004-02-02

Nevertheless, the wait is worth it, and the movie was a blockbuster. While no one would confuse this uplifting Depression-era tale with a book on computer code, Secure Coding shares a basic similarity with Seabiscuit: The former doesn't trot out its subject--an actual piece of software code--until page 76, and the result is outstanding nonetheless.<br />The similarity ends there. While moviegoers eagerly awaited Seabiscuit's appearance, security professionals might well dread the first appearance of code. Refreshingly, the book contains only seven pages of software code.<br />Similarly themed books spend most of their time in the nitty-gritty of actual code. This one is a horse of a different color, dealing with what needs to be done before the first line of software code is actually written. With the goal of helping developers create applications that are resilient against attacks, the authors develop the book around three categories of software development: architecture and design, implementation, and operations.<br />Above and beyond technical aspects of software development, the authors describe how serious security vulnerabilities leak into the software-development process. These include ignorance, psychological issues, and the short time spans allotted to the development process.<br />This book is a sure bet to help developers and project managers create secure software applications without bogging down in specific code.	2004-01-02

An outgrowth of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, OCTAVE attempts to help organizations balance the risks of information systems with the business need to deploy these systems. This book is a solid explanation of OCTAVE.<br />The authors detail the methods to implement OCTAVE, create threat profiles, conduct a risk analysis, develop strategy, and so on. All steps to ensure that risk is adequately addressed are presented.<br />Most useful for the practitioner are the book's numerous case studies and worksheets and its catalog of the eight OCTAVE processes. A caveat: it is unwise to fill out the worksheets without first reading the book. Doing OCTAVE right means no shortcuts. Also, the reader shouldn't think that this approach can be implemented by a single person in a few days.<br />In sum, while the prose doesn't exactly sing, it does strike the appropriate tone for this excellent presentation on OCTAVE.	2003-12-02

But Security Technologies for the World Wide Web is one work that is well worth the paper. A comprehensive primer on information security and privacy, the book covers the essentials, including hyptertext transfer protocol (http), public key infrastructure, electronic payment systems, and much more.<br />Though targeted to technically proficient readers, the clear, lucid prose is surprisingly free of deadening detail. The author also makes good use of screen shots.<br />Perhaps the most timely component here is a chapter that provides a good overview of Microsoft's popular .NET Passport initiative. This online authentication program, which allows single sign-on to multiple sites, boasts more than 200 million users. Privacy advocates, however, fear that the system will give Microsoft too much control over how personal user data is shared.<br />Although the book is relatively up to date--an increasingly difficult task as computer technology rockets forward--the occasional error appears. The only other drawback of this otherwise fine book is its relatively high ($89) price tag.	2003-10-27

Dr. Shari Krause looks at over 40 aircraft incidents and accidents, analyzes why they occurred, and offers suggestions to avoid future calamities.<br />Krause concentrates on four probable accident cause areas (human factors, weather, mid-air collisions, mechanical failure) and highlights the perspectives of pilots, crewmembers, air traffic controllers, and the National Transportation Safety Board.<br />Many of Krause's conclusions center on two areas, pilot error and failure to properly use the technology.  Many of these pilots are not some newbie's who read a for dummies book, or are recently certified via some technology boot camp.  They are professionals that have spent thousands and tens of thousands of hours in the cockpit.  These commercial pilots have physicals every six months, and spend significant amounts of time annual being retrained and tested.<br />These commercial pilots work in cockpits whose avionic hardware costs millions of dollars.  Yet with all of this, these same pilots often don't think and attempt to land during an active thunderstorm, fly their airplane into mountains (officially known as CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain), and more.<br />The book is fascinating and a valuable read.	2003-10-02

In the cyberworld, the router is the virtual gatekeeper, monitoring the door that leads to the Internet. But firms often ignore the router's protective function, focusing instead on firewalls, encryption, and antivirus software.<br />Securing and Controlling Cisco Routers is an important book for anyone tasked with securing routers and corporate networks. Given that Cisco dominates the router industry, this book is especially pertinent.<br />After an introduction to TCP/IP and basic security, networking, and routing concepts, the author delves into core security issues such as authentication, authorization, and accounting; encryption; RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service); and Kerberos (an authentication system used to transmit private information over open networks). Nearly every section ends with material that allows the reader to practice the technologies discussed on a real PC. These sessions use the appropriate Cisco syntax, which is crucial because the Cisco Internetworking Operating System is notoriously abstract. Readers will find that being able to log onto a real router, practice the commands, and gather information is an enormous advantage.<br />The documentation that comes with Cisco routers is impressive, but it lacks security detail. This book more than compensates for that deficit.	2003-10-01

Moby Dick is an American classic, and an insomniacs delight.  Similarly, Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography is the definitive book on cryptography, but is far too complex and mathematical for most readers.<br />With that, Practical Cryptography is a superb text for anyone needing to know the core details of cryptography, but don't want to be bogged down with theoretical and abstract cryptographic ideas.<br />Where Applied Cryptography is a reference, Practical Cryptography is meant to be a narrative.  The book follows the design of a secure cryptographic system from its algorithm selection, design philosophy, analysis, debugging and implementation.<br />The implementation aspect is crucial, as while there are many books available on the theory of cryptography, there is amazingly little about its practical implementation.  While Practical Cryptography is a much easier read than Applied Cryptography, it is primarily geared for the applications<br />While Practical Cryptography is not as technical as its older brother Applied Cryptography, it is still not a For Dummies type of book.  The average reader will likely find most of the book far too abstract for their needs.  But for those that are looking for a practical and usable book about implementing cryptography, this is the definitive reference.	2003-09-01

But being over 8 years old, it looses something in the way of being up to date.<br />That is the niche `Modern Cryptography: Theory and Practice' attempts to fill, and Wenbo Mao does a good job at it.<br />One nice thing about the book is that the author details all of the standard notation use, which is helpful.<br />The book does a very good job on showing how cryptography can be used for integration into software.  Whereas Applied Cryptography had software-coding examples, Modern Cryptography does not.  So this book is not germane for programmers looking to write secure code.<br />The book is not for the faint-hearted.  It's prerequisite is for well-experienced cryptographers and is clearly an advanced text.  But for those that are looking for an intense, up to date reference on modern cryptography, this is clearly an excellent book.	2003-08-22

Today's storage systems routinely surpass the terabyte (about 1 million megabytes) level, and sometimes reach the petabyte (1,024 terabytes). High-end systems often have a gigabyte (1,024 megabytes) or more of RAM. With storage space becoming less of an issue, the technological challenge becomes making vast amounts of data easily available and accessible.<br />One of today's hottest storage technologies is called storage area network (SAN). A SAN essentially enables a single data store to be available to many different hosts. Thus, it becomes much easier to make large amounts of data available. But that's not the end of the story; the challenge then becomes making the data accessible to those who need it.<br />In fewer than 200 pages, Practical Storage Area Networking provides an excellent overview into SANs, from initial design and integration to maintenance and data security. All processes involved in a SAN project, including capacity planning, component selection, and storage sizing, are helpfully reviewed.<br />While SANs have their uses, security remains a problem. The author is honest enough to note that SANs have a ways to go to be truly secure.<br />For those who need a quick overview on SANs, this is an advisable choice.	2003-07-31

If you are looking for details on how to secure Active Directory or similar; this is not the book.  But if you are looking to find out how to determine the risk of deploying  Active Directory or similar technology in a large-enterprise, Inside the Security Mind shoes the way in which to approach that endeavor.<br />Overall, Inside the Security Mind is a very readable reference.  It is light on acronyms, fluff and filler (the dirge of many security books) and heavy on methodology and direction.<br />If you are interested in determining how to deal with security and risk for your enterprise network, Inside the Security Mind is a good place to start.<br />While the full title is Inside the Security Mind: Making the Tough Decisions; after reading the book, making the tough security decisions won't be so difficult.	2003-07-27

With that, Managing A Network Vulnerability Assessment, gives the reader a all-inclusive framework for running a network vulnerability assessment.<br />The book goes over issues such as scooping, assessment and scanning methodologies, reports, etc.<br />The main part of the book is quickly readable at 187 pages.<br />Appendix A is an ISO 17799 self -assessment checklist, which can be used to validate a system to an external reference.  There are a few other checklists.<br />Before anyone blindly runs a network scanner, they should read this book first to ensure that their scanning is done effectively and productively.	2003-06-27

Now, that information is only a Web trip to Google away. With the combined power of Internet tools and cheap hard drives, search engines and archival databases can enable almost anyone to find information about almost anyone else.<br />Today's challenge, however, is not finding or storing the data, but rather making sense of it. That's where Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection comes in. It shows how myriad distributed data streams can be harnessed to fight crime.<br />Through easy-to-read prose, the reader learns how to use both public and private databases and networks to find threats and minimize risks. Besides explaining how data mining is done, the book introduces the reader to such techniques as intelligent agents (software that performs user-delegated tasks autonomously), link analysis (a process involving the mapping of the associations between suspects and locations), and text mining (a process used to identify a document's content based on linguistic analysis) and how they can aid law enforcement.<br />For example, law enforcement in the United Kingdom use text mining to \\"institutionalize the knowledge of criminal perpetrators and organized gangs and groups,\\" author Jes&uacute;s Mena writes. Case studies buttress these points.<br />This work is one of the first books to show security professionals the power of data mining as an investigative tool. As such, it is itself a powerful tool for the industry.	2003-06-27

Well thought-out tables and illustrations are used to organize ideas and concepts.<br />The nice thing about the book is that the author stays on target and does not go off on various tangents and digressions.<br />The book closes with a few case studies and a quiz.  My only complaint of the book is that the reader has to pay [$$$]- to get the quiz graded and receives the correct answers in order to get CEU credits.  But for the reader that does not want the CEU credits, but simply the correct answers, they are at a disadvantage.<br />Other than that caveat, HIPAA Made Simple is an excellent resource for anyone who needs to quickly get up to speed on HIPAA.  The book takes no more than a few hours to read.  After completion, the reader will know the core issues of HIPAA and what they need to do to gain compliance.<br />While some may be initially put off by the price of [$$$], it is clearly worth it, given the cost and complexities of even the simplest HIPAA endeavor.	2003-06-03

Rather than focusing on the software that drives the application, the book analyzes how users actually interact with the system. This interaction is what ultimately will determine whether a system is successful or unproductive.<br />The book provides a comprehensive look at the entire set of requirements involved with design. The authors show that there is much more to systems design than end-user requirements and CGI scripts. Effective HCI is a multi-disciplinary area including psychology, sociology, anthropology, information systems, and computer science.<br />The authors write that their book is called &quot;Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction&quot; because it is concerned with the broader scope of issues, topics, and paradigms than has been traditionally written in other books. The book notes that there has never been a greater need for interactions designers and usability engineers to develop current and next-generation interaction technologies. To be successful in the interface design game, programmers need a mixed set of skills, which is not an easy task.<br />Interaction Design comprises 15 densely packed chapters that integrate all of the various cognitive, social, and other issues that are germane to interaction design. Chapter 1 provides an overview of what makes for good and bad design. Chapter 3 gets into the psychological aspect of HCI and looks at cognition and how users interact with the systems they implement. None of the book makes for easy reading, as the topics at hand are often multifaceted and complex. Chapter 6 deals with the process of interaction design and for the most part ends the psychological approach, while Chapters 7 through 10 deal with the actual design of the system.<br />The book has a number of real-world case studies, and also includes interviews with various authorities on HCI. However, it does not get into specific technologies (Solaris, Linux, etc.). Also, each chapter concludes with a number of references, which can be used as a launching pad for more information.<br />I highly recommend Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction for anyone who is serious about interface design. Your users will appreciate it.I and looks at cognition and how users interact with the systems they implement.

It is significant that a large amount of HCI deals with non-programming issues such as psychological approaches to end-user experience, social manners of the audience, and more. The Essential Guide to User Interface Design provide a comprehensive overview of the essentials of interface design.<br />The Essential Guide to User Interface Design focuses on the actual design of the GUI. While Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction explains why a user may react a specific way to a GUI, The Essential Guide to User Interface Design details the principles and techniques effective for GUI design. Although the book does focus on end-user interaction with systems, the bulk of the book focuses on the actual interface design and layout.<br />The book provides numerous examples of how small changes can affect end-user productivity, including how the selection of the appropriate component can be used to make a more efficient application. From a business perspective, Chapter 1 shows how one company saved a fortune in operational costs by simply redesigning one window in their application. While ROI is generally not a case for better GUI design, it is a compelling byproduct, nonetheless.<br />The book is divided into two parts. The first two chapters make up Part 1 and provide an overview of the importance of the user interface. The basics of HCI and GUIs are also detailed in this section.<br />Part 2 constitutes the bulk of the book (Chapters 3 through 16). In Part 2, the author describes 14 steps involved with the user interface design process. Steps 1 and 2 involve understanding who the end user is and the business function. Steps 3 - 14 go into the nitty gritty of interface design and address menus, windows, control selections, text and messages, and more. The Essential Guide to User Interface Design also provides screen shots that illustrate how to properly design effective user interfaces.sign effective user interfaces.	2003-01-15

While anyone can ..get the Red Hat Linux software for free, books on Linux or other open source topics will cost the reader money. But for readers who are willing to shell out [the money]for a book about Linux security, Red Hat Linux Security and Optimization is a good overview on the core concepts of Linux security and how to secure, optimize, and harden Red Hat.<br />The book is titled Red Hat Linux Security and Optimization, indicating that both topics are covered, but the bulk of this book (chapters 8 - 21) really deals with security topics. Only the first 7 chapters deal with system and network performance.<br />Part 1 of the book comprises three chapters on system performance. Issues such as performance basics and kernel tuning are discussed. It shows how users can compile and install their own custom kernel. Chapter 3 is on file system tuning and deals with standard issues such as determining which file system to use and the creation of volumes and partitions.<br />The three chapters of Part 2 (Network and Service Performance) detail the issues of network and server performance. Chapter 5 provides a good overview of tweaking Apache and the use of Squid.<br />Part 3, System Security, is the heart of the book. The author takes a bottom up approach to security, where he starts with kernel security and progresses to other topics such as file system security, network security, passwords, and more.<br />Part 4 details network security, from DNS and BIND, to SSL, FTP, and the other major networking protocols. Chapter 17 has a good synopsis of email and the vulnerabilities associated with open email gateways, and how to control mail relays so as not to be used as a spam clearinghouse.<br />The book finishes with Part 5, which comprises two chapters about Linux firewalls. It also includes information about VPNs, SSL tunnels, and assessment tools.<br />The enclosed CD-ROM has a lot of security software, including standard security tools such as John the Ripper, netcat, nessus, nmap, and more. Is also includes other software such as Tripwire, Saint, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, tcpdump, and more. Also included is an electronic version of the book. With the exception of the electronic copy of the book, everything on the CD-ROM is available free off the Net. It would have been nice if the book could have included a second CD-ROM with the Linux operating system software. Although the software can be downloaded from Red Hat, the nearly 1 GB of data can take quite a while to download, even with a broadband connection.<br />Red Hat Linux Security and Optimization is a straightforward book that details all of the rudiments of Linux functionality and security.

If lawyers can talk jurors out of trusting their own eyes, then getting digital evidence of a computer crime thrown out should be child's play.<br />Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime was written to prevent that latter scenario from occurring. This is a primer for the many information technology departments that are uninformed regarding how to identify and properly collect hard-to-find digital evidence.<br />The authors, both veterans in computer crime response, provide a remarkably well-documented overview of how to ensure that evidence left over from a computer crime is not compromised. The book details the proper courses of action to respond to computer breaches. Web sites and software tools are listed to ease the way for the investigator.<br />Since digital evidence is often the only substantiation of a computer crime, securing this evidence is paramount. This book shows how it's done, and anyone involved in computer security or incident response should know too.	2002-12-26

While Unix has achieved a level of ubiquitousness unparalleled in information systems, the fact remains that with hundreds of different flavors of Unix, getting a handle on the operating system is no easy feat.<br />UNIX Administration: A Comprehensive Sourcebook for Effective Systems & Network Management attempts to be a single-source handbook for the administration and maintenance of Unix systems and networks. However, because it is clearly impossible to cover every Unix variant, the book primarily focuses on BSD and System 5. Other flavors covered include Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, AIX, and IRIX.<br />The author's biography states that he is an electronics engineer by training and a hardware designer and programmer by trade. With that, this book should not be construed as a \\"For Dummies\\" book. It is written for serious Unix administrators that need a comprehensive Unix resource. The author's writing style can be a little stiff at times, but the main point is that the content is there.<br />The book is well organized into four sections containing 28 chapters. The four sections are UNIX Administration, Network Administration, Supplemental Unix Topics, and Case Studies.<br />Like many Unix books, Chapter 1 starts out with an overview of the life of Unix - its history, development, and the plethora of legal issues, including the BSD and System 5 legal wrangling. It also covers important issues such as various newsgroups, conferences, and organizations related to Unix. While none of the information in Chapter 1 (or the entire book, for that matter) is new, the main benefit of the book is to have all of that information in a single, hard copy volume.<br />Speaking of content, Chapter 4 provides a good look on how Unix starts up and correspondingly shuts down. This chapter details how a Unix host starts up and includes all of the myriad initializations that must take place, which also explains why, from a forensics perspective, one of the worst things that someone can do to a Unix host that has been hacked is to shut it down or restart a penetrated system.<br />Chapter 13 is another valuable chapter that goes into time-related Unix facilities. One important and often underused capability is that of time synchronization. The book details how to correctly use the NTP (Network Time Protocol) daemon and its corresponding configuration files.<br />Section 2 starts with Chapter 14, which is an overview of network fundamentals, including an overview of the TCP/IP and ISO layer. Other topics covered include DNS, NIS, remote services and commands, and email. Once again, none of this information is new, just contained in a single hardbound volume.<br />Section 4 is that shortest section of the book, and provides the details of installing various flavors of Unix. Sample configuration files are included, which are quite helpful because an errant or mistyped command can suspend an installation.<br />Chapter 28 is one that you hope you will never have to use - Emergency Situations. This chapter discusses such issues as lost boot passwords, partition faults, and other nightmare scenarios.<br />Overall, UNIX Administration: A Comprehensive Sourcebook for Effective Systems & Network Management can be utilized as a single Unix reference manual. The only downside to the book is its price... it is rather expensive, especially given that there is an overabundance of similar free material on the Net ...<br />For admins who want a single, first-rate reference guide to Unix, and don't mind spending the money, UNIX Administration: A Comprehensive Sourcebook for Effective Systems & Network Management will fit the bill quite well.forensics perspective, one of the worst things that someone can do to a Unix host that has been hacked is to shut it down or restart a penetrated system. <br />Chapter 13 is another valuable chapter that goes into time-related Unix facilities.

There are a lot of different entities involved, that all must work together to ensure that the edifice is properly constructed.  If the building is not properly constructed, even a small wind can topple it.<br />While a house needs an architect, contractors, plumbers, electricians and much more; networks require similar sets of skills if it is to be deployed in a secure manner.  The problem with designing secure Internet sites is that the dynamics of information systems means that the foundation is constantly changing.  Just as companies are finishing their migrations, there are new updates to deal with.  The threats and vulnerabilities are for the most part increasing quicker than most organizations are able to deal with<br />For those looking to design their Internet information security infrastructure, Internet Site Security is an excellent title to use as their guide.  It is like an architects guide to building secure networks.<br />The book is quite comprehensive in its coverage of all critical areas of security.  It details how to build a secure infrastructure and how to deploy policies to protect it.  It covers various technologies such as intrusion detections systems and firewalls, and shows how they are to be effectively deployed.<br />Then advantage of the book is that it has just the right combination of breath and depth.  Topics are covered effectively, and the authors do not waste the reader's time by going into obscure security minutiae or academic threats.<br />Readers looking for an effective guide to fundamental issues involved with information security and Internet security are well advised to read Internet Site Security.

But in the age of the Internet how does one perform a sting operation in a digital manner?  The answer is via a honeypot.  A honeypot is a security resource (generally a file server, router or web server) whose value lies in being probed, attacked or compromised.  By having a honeypot, organizations can see who their adversaries are, and in what manner their corporate digital assets are being attacked.<br />One of the many advantages that honeypots offer are that they enable organizations to take the offensive, as traditionally, the attackers have always has had the initiative.  By taking an offensive security stance, companies are much better able and prepared to defend themselves.<br />Honeypots: Tracking Hackers is written by Lance Spitzner, one of the veterans in the field.  The book complements his previous work Know Your Enemy: Revealing the Security Tools, Tactics, and Motives of the Blackhat Community (reviewed June 2002).  The book is an excellent resource for those that want to build their own honeypot.<br />The book open with an introduction into honeypots and the different roles they can play.  It then details in depth various commercial and open source honeypots.  The book details the pros and cons of honeypots.  It makes it clear that honeypots are not for every organization; as the maintenance of honeypots can be time consuming and must be done by a person who knows exactly what they are doing and looking at.<br />Even for those that have no intention of implementing a honeypot, the book has a wealth of information about attackers and their methods.  While not every organization may want to implement a honeypot, every organization is a target.  By understanding who desires to attacks your corporate digital assets, you can be better prepared to defend them.<br />Not overly technical, Honeypots: Tracking Hackers is a fascinating read, and an important book for any information security professional.	2002-10-31

Rather than focusing on the writer's past, it is clear that Mitnick wishes the book to be viewed as an attempt at redemption.<br />The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security states that even if an organization has the best information systems security policies and procedures; most tightly controlled firewall, encrypted traffic, DMZ's, hardened operating systems patched servers and more; all of these security controls can be obviated via social engineering.<br />Social engineering is a method of gaining someone's trust by lying to them and then abusing that trust for malicious purposes - primarily gaining access to systems. Every user in an organization, be it a receptionist or a systems administrator, needs to know that when someone requesting information has some knowledge about company procedures or uses the corporate vernacular, that alone should not be authorization to provide controlled information.<br />The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security spends most of its time discussing many different social engineering scenarios. At the end of each chapter, the book analyzes what went wrong and how the attack could have been prevented.<br />The book is quite absorbing and makes for fascinating reading. With chapter titles such as The Direct Attack; Just Asking for it; the Reverse Sting; and Using Sympathy, Guilt and Intimidation, readers will find the narratives interesting, and often they relate to daily life at work.<br />Fourteen of the 16 chapters give examples of social engineering covering many different corporate sectors, including financial, manufacturing, medical, and legal. Mitnick notes that while companies are busy rolling out firewalls and other security paraphernalia, there are often unaware of the threats of social engineering. The menace of social engineering is that it does not take any deep technical skills - no protocol decoders, no kernel recompiling, no port scans - just some smooth talk and a little confidence.<br />Most of the stories in the book detail elementary social engineering escapades, but chapter 14 details one particularly nasty story where a social engineer showed up on-site at a robotics company. With some glib talk, combined with some drinks at a fancy restaurant, he ultimately was able to get all of the design specifications for a leading-edge product.<br />In order for an organization to develop a successful training program against the threats of social engineering, they must understand why people are vulnerable to attack in the first place. Chapter 15 explains of how attackers take advantage of human nature. Only by identifying and understanding these tendencies (namely, Authority, Liking, Reciprocation, Consistency, Social Validation, and Scarcity), can companies ensure employees understand why social engineers can manipulate us all.<br />After more than 200 pages of horror stories, Part 4 (Chapters 15 and 16) details the need for information security awareness and training. But even with 100 pages of security policies and procedures (much of it based on ideas from Charles Cresson Wood's seminal book Information Security Policies Made Easy) the truth is that nothing in Mitnick's security advice is revolutionary - it's information security 101. Namely, educate end-users to the risks and threats of non-technical attacks.<br/>While there are many books on nearly every aspect of information security, The Art of Deception is one of the first (Bruce Schneier's Secrets and Lies being another) to deal with the human aspect of security; a topic that has long been neglected. For too long, corporate America has been fixated with cryptographic key lengths, and not focused enough on the human element of security.<br />From a management perspective, The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security should be on the list of required reading. Mitnick has done an effective job of showing exactly what the greatest threat of attack is - people and their human nature./>While there are many books on nearly every aspect of information security, The Art of Deception is one of the first (Bruce Schneier's Secrets and Lies being another) to deal with the human aspect of security; a topic that has long been neglected.

Critical security functionalities such as encryption, digital signatures, and authentication are simply not part of the XML standard. XML is similar to many other protocols, languages, and operating systems in that it was originally developed without any thought to security and privacy. It is only after serious security vulnerabilities are discovered and publicized that they are patched. But this find, patch, fix mentality of information security is dangerous in that security problems can exist for months or years before they are found.<br />Similarly within XML, much of the security functionality has been added post- facto, namely in Canonical XML, XML Signature, and XML Encryption Syntax and Processing. By adding security to the core feature set of XML, the W3C has ensured that,<br />to a degree, the find, patch, fix method won't be the manner in which XML security is developed. A good reference book can help you navigate this XML security landscape.<br />Topics such as authentication, encryption, XML signatures, algorithms, and keying are discussed. For the most part, the bulk of XML security is covered.<br />Donald Eastlake, the lead author of Secure XML: The New Syntax for Signatures and Encryption, is the co-chairman of the joint IETF/W3C XML Digital Signature working group, a member of the W3C Encryption and W3C XML Key Management System working groups, and co-author of the XML Digital Signature, XML Encryption, and XML Exclusive Canonicalization standards. It is clear that Eastlake lives and breathes XML. As Eastlake is a writer of numerous W3C XML standards, and standards are often written in a terse and abstract manner; his book has a slightly stiffer writing style than XML Security. If you can get over this style, you can appreciate the comprehensive and uthoritative look at XML the book provides from one of the key architects of the syntax.<br />Secure XML covers and details every XML security feature. Also, it spends a lot of time giving examples of syntax and language use. This is especially so in chapter 9, XML Canonicalization - The Key to Robustness. Canonicalization is the extraction of the standard form of some data and the discarding of insignificant aspects of the data's surface representations. The book notes that getting the right canonicalization is one of the most important, yet difficult aspects of digital authentication within XML. Chapter 10 goes into great detail about XML signatures and authentication. The chapter gives numerous code examples of various contexts, schemas, and elements that readers can use on their own XML servers. Chapter 10 also has numerous notes and historical information about XML security with information that can't be found elsewhere.and details every XML security feature.

US	48840057	R2CYK2RBK9SHYY	0072193999	792066351	XML Security	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Excellent book on XML security	When you read the XML specification, you will notice that it contains no notion of security. Critical security functionalities such as encryption, digital signatures, and authentication are simply not part of the XML standard. XML is similar to many other protocols, languages, and operating systems in that it was originally developed without any thought to security and privacy. It is only after serious security vulnerabilities are discovered and publicized that they are patched. But this find, patch, fix mentality of information security is dangerous in that security problems can exist for months or years before they are found.<br />Similarly within XML, much of the security functionality has been added post- facto, namely in Canonical XML, XML Signature, and XML Encryption Syntax and Processing. By adding security to the core feature set of XML, the W3C has ensured that,<br />to a degree, the find, patch, fix method won't be the manner in which XML security is developed. A good reference book can help you navigate this XML security landscape.<br />XML Security is a reader friendly title and focuses more on the implementation of XML. For readers looking for ways to use XML and less coding examples, XML Security is more useful book. The author, Blake Dournaee, is an employee of RSA Security, and the book is an RSA Press imprint. Furthermore, Chapter 8, the book's longest chapter, is about XML Signatures implementing the RSA BSAFE(c) Cert-J toolkit. Even with the RSA vendor bias, XML Security provides a good reference to the XML security functionality.<br />This book spends more time introducing the reader to security concepts, and Chapters 2 and 3 (Security Primer and XML Primer) provide the reader with a good overview about all of the significant concepts involved. Chapter 6 provides a plethora of XML signature examples. As XML signatures are rich in their features and syntax, combined with the vast number of elements and permutations of those elements, it can be quite difficult for someone to understand how to properly use XML signatures. Chapter 6 provides 14 different scenarios and their proposed solutions. These scenarios range from adding a single signature to a basic XML document, to adding multiple types of signatures to various documents. For readers who need good hands-on examples, Chapter 6 is worth the price of the book alone.te difficult for someone to understand how to properly use XML signatures.

The main function of a prep guide is to prepare the test taker for the nature of the questions and answer.  If someone is looking for tips such as bring extra pencils and eat a lot of carbohydrates before the test, this book expects a mature reader and does not give such simple advice.<br />Each section gives a good overview of what the test taker needs to know about that part of the CBK.<br />The question and answer section gives the reader a very good overview of the nature of what to expect on the CISSP exam.<br />The Total CISSP Exam Prep Book is obviously not going to be as comprehensive as Shon Harris's book, since Harris's book is nearly three times the size and 5 times the weight.<br />If you are looking for a CISSP Test Taking for Dummies book, look elsewhere.

But with  dial- up technology that can remotely start up a computer, such an approach is no longer sufficient. The old approaches must be modified to deal with the current computer security threats; and with that, Desktop Witness - The Do's & Don'ts of Personal Computer Security attempts to enable the reader do the unthinkable - both use their personal computer, and have security and privacy.  While many technologically proficient com readers may not be intimidated by command- line interfaces or regular expressions, mainstream computer users are intimidated by their computers. Not only that, they often have an implicit trust in their computers, and will do anything it, or a Trojan horse suggests.<br />The reality is that for the most part, the term \\"personal computer security\\" is an oxymoron. Since the vast majority of personal computers are running versions of Windows 98/95/3.1, and given that Windows 98/95/3.1 has little to no security, personal computer security is indeed a contradiction in terms. Author Michael Caloyannides admits this in chapter 4 of Desktop Witness when he writes that \\"making a Windowbased computer immune to hostile computer forensics is an impossible task unless you do this for a living day and night.\\" But for those that may be using operating systems with security features (Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP, Solaris, etc.), the problem is how to use the systems in a manner that protects their personal security and privacy. This is made more difficult in that nearly every activity performed on a computer and network leaves evidence.<br />The book is called Desktop Witness because personal computers keep logs and records of every document created, every email sent, every Web site visited, and much more. All of that personal information is a digital eyewitness to the activity in that specific computer. In the physical word, Newton's Third Law of Motion states that \\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\\" In the digital world, every data request or action also creates another reaction, and it is those reactions that often compromise personal privacy and security.<br />The book comprises seven content- heavy chapters. After the perfunctory introduction, the book spends chapter 2 discussing encryption. While encryption is crucial for security, for the average reader (who may be uninformed about computer security), dealing with encryption algorithms on page 21 is too much, too soon. Chapters 4 and 5 comprise the bulk of the book and deal with protection of computers connected to and not connected to the Internet or other networks. While a plethora of good ideas and tools are mentioned, the typical end users will not be able to keep up with all of the necessary system changes and configuration modifications.<br />While the book presents a lot of things that end users can do to secure their computers, and is written in a straightforward manner, the reality is that there is so much to constantly do so that most users will simply be unable to regain control of their computers. Even with such a predicament, Desktop Witness still figures out a way to enable end-users to have security and privacy.<br />A quick read through the book proves that the author has his paranoid meter set on high. While that may be fine for more sophisticated users, the overall tone of the book follo ws that level of paranoia and many of the suggestions may be unfeasible for most end users. One idea that Caloyannides repeatedly suggests is to not use Microsoft Internet Explorer because of its own security risks and the fact that it's so tightly coupled with the Windows operating system. Another idea that the author suggests is to put special security screws on a PC to identify surreptitious activity.<br />Finally, the author also suggests not using any ISP installation software (Earthlink, AOL, etc.) that comes on a CD-ROM. The author's rationale is that ISPs often have spyware on the CD-ROMs that will be surreptitiously installed with their connectivity software. Parts of the book are written for people who live under repressive regimes and need to protect themselves against possible death and torture. While such suggestions have merit, most people living under repressive regimes can't afford a computer, or even $50.00 for a book such as this.<br />Readers with technical expertise won't be intimidated by Desktop Witness. However, readers who aren't as technically inclined may find this book to be a bit daunting. Those readers may want to consider a less onerous title such as Have You Locked the Castle Gate?: Home and Small Business Computer Security by Brian Shea (Addison Wesley, ISBN: 020171955X 2002). The focus of Desktop Witness is on personal and individual computers, so readers needing a more corporate and global look on how to secure large systems should consider Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems by Ross Anderson (John Wiley and Sons, ISBN: 0471389226 2001).<br />For those readers who share a level of paranoia such as Caloyannides, the book will have a lot of good suggestions and valuable references. But for the general public, who often struggle just to get their computers powered on, the myriad suggestions in the book may prove overwhelming and impractical.that ISPs often have spyware on the CD-ROMs that will be surreptitiously installed with their connectivity software.

Hard-wired (cabled) networks have been around for decades and they are still for the most part insecure.  Wireless networking (focusing on 802.11), which has been around for only a few years, is clearly an insecure technology.  With that, there is currently not a lot to write about when it comes to effective wireless security.<br />Wireless Security Essentials: Defending Mobile Systems from Data Piracy confirms that there is little to say on this topic because although it is 345 pages in length, only about 75 pages deal with wireless security.  Of those 75 pages (pages 135 - 207), about 15 pages discuss vendor products.<br />The first 135 pages and 4 chapters of the book are an introduction to computer technology, networking, wireless security, and basic security issues. In addition to the 75 pages on wireless security, pages 209 - 345 are composed of a comprehensive glossary and 4 appendixes.<br />Only in chapter 5 does the book get into \\" wireless security\\".  For the most part, people equate wireless with 802.11.  Within 802.11, the security functionality is provided by WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), which provides the underlying security of 802.11.  But an insurmountable problem is that WEP has been proven (see Breaking 802.11 Security at [URL]) to be seriously flawed, and is therefore insecure.  Since the security foundation of 802.11 is basically nil, 802.11 networks as of this writing simply can't be adequately secured.<br />So why do companies deploy wireless networks given their inherent security risks?  For the same reason they deploy Windows -- functionality.  While Windows is for the most part an insecure operating system, its functionality is huge, and history has shown that functionality wins over security.<br />The functionality of wireless has even given birth to a new pastime of war chalking.  War chalking is when an area of public access has been determined to have a wireless access point available, it is marked with chalk to let everyone know.  For more information on war chalking, see [URL]<br />While the book does have valuable information, the fact that only 75 pages of it are specific to wireless security may not warrant its [price] purchase price.  There are numerous free articles on the Internet that provide roughly the same amount of information and may be more cost effective to most readers.  One place to start is The Unofficial 802.11 Security Web Page at [URL]/ and also 802.11 Security Beyond WEP at [URL].when an area of public access has been determined to have a wireless access point available, it is marked with chalk to let everyone know.

There are currently four specifications in the family: 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, all of which use the basic Ethernet protocols.<br />Within the last few years, wireless networks have become extremely popular. No longer must a physical cable be run (at both a time and monetary expense) to each network host. With wireless technology, impromptu meetings can be set up just about anywhere, from conference rooms to airplanes, hotel rooms, and more.<br />Anyone who has looked at network standards can attest to how boring they are to read. However, Gast does a wonderful job writing about wireless Ethernet in a way that is not only \\"not boring,\\" but actually interesting. This is due to his expertise with the subject matter and the many real-world scenarios that he shares.<br />Gast acknowledges that most readers who simply want a methodical, but not all-inclusive, overview of 802.11 can skip chapters 3 through 11, as they deal with the low level details of 802.11. He clearly states that just as it is quite possible to build a wired network without a thorough and detailed understanding of the protocols, the same is true for wireless networks. Nonetheless, there are a number of situations where one may need a deeper knowledge of the underpinnings of 802.11, and those underpinning are exhaustively detailed in chapters 3 through 11.<br />Chapters 3 and 4 address the MAC layer and 802.11 framing. Chapter 5 deals with the greatest weakness of 802.11 -- namely its lack of security.  Chapter 5 clearly states the problems and inadequacies associated with 802.11 security and use of the WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) authentication protocol.  However, despite all of the security weaknesses in 802.11, Gast never directly advises security conscious organizations to stay clear of 802.11. He does provide information on a possible successor to WEP, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).<br />WEP has numerous public security flaws.  The first critical weakness was detailed in the now seminal paper, \\"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4.\\"  One of the paper's authors is Adi Shamir (Shamir is the S in RSA).  Shamir's findings were considered somewhat of a death blow to WEP.<br />Chapter 8 deals with an unimplemented aspect of 802.11 -- the PCF (Point Coordination Function). Like PCF itself, much of chapters 3 through 11 are quite dry. The book includes relevant diversions into such topics as RF physics and issues such as the nonexistent microwave absorption peak of water.<br />Chapter 11 concludes the theory portion of the book, and chapters 12 and 13 deal with the very real issue of using 802.11 on Windows and Linux.  Although most 802.11 installations are fairly straightforward, there are a number of specific configuration parameters that must be set correctly if the wireless network is to operate at peak efficiency.<br />Perhaps the most important chapter of the book is Chapter 15, \\"802.11 Network Deployment.\\" As a security professional, I have seen many companies hastily deploy wireless technology, oblivious to the many wireless security weaknesses.  The ease with which 802.11 can be deployed has allowed many organizations to overlook such critical issues as eavesdropping, scaling, radio interference, stability, and topology. Gast points out that proper deployment of a wireless LAN is a considerable undertaking, and that significant planning is required before one should even start thinking about the hardware.<br />Chapters 16 and 17 deal with network analysis and performance tuning.  Gast describes what to look for when using a protocol analyzer on an 802.11 network and how to ensure its effective use. Chapter 16 includes three case studies using actual output from a sniffer. This chapter is quite valuable and also covers the use of AirSnort. AirSnort ([...]) is a wireless network tool used to recover WEP encryption keys. It works by passively monitoring network transmissions and then computing the WEP encryption key. AirSnort was one of the first publicly available tools to implement the attack described in the \\"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4\\" paper.<br />Overall, 802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide is an excellent guide for any network administrator or architect who needs to understand the ins and outs of 802.11 networking. It has all the necessary information for design and deployment of wireless networks in an easy to read and enjoyable style.es three case studies using actual output from a sniffer.

There are many reasons for its predominance. It was the first commercial<br />firewall on the market, but more importantly, the FireWall-1 GUI and its ease of use impressed corporate CIO's.<br />Although FireWall-1 is easy to use, some users face difficulty in configuring the product correctly and appropriately. In fact, one of the biggest dangers of a firewall is that it can<br />provide a false sense of security; if not properly configured, a firewall may have so many holes that it actually functions as nothing more than a router. Firewall expert Marcus<br />Ranum notes that, \\"...eventually, if enough data is going back and forth through your firewall, it is no longer a firewall -- it is a router.\\"<br />Many times, firewall administrators are hired not because of their expertise in information security, but because they know network and systems administration quite<br />well. Many FireWall-1 administrators start with zero experience and knowledge. This is good from a job security and training perspective, but terrible from a security perspective.<br />Despite the proliferation and ubiquitous nature of FireWall-1 over the past decade, it is only in the last few months that any worthwhile books on FireWall-1 have become<br />available. One of the best is Essential Checkpoint Firewall-1: An Installation, Configuration, and Troubleshooting Guide by Dameon Welch-Abernathy. Welch-<br />Abernathy maintains a Web site, ..., which contains information on anything and everything related to FireWall-1. In fact, many FireWall-1 administrators have<br />... bookmarked as their prime site for FireWall-1 information, even before the Check Point support site.<br />Although the documentation that comes with FireWall-1 is quite good, Essential Checkpoint Firewall-1 often surpasses it. This is what makes Welch-Abernathy known as<br />the man for FireWall-1. Even Nir Zuk, who was a principal engineer at Check Point, stated that Welch-Abernathy's knowledge of FireWall-1 in many cases surpassed the<br />knowledge of Check Point's own engineers.<br />As its title implies, the book covers the installation, configuration, and troubleshooting of FireWall-1. Whereas the product itself is pretty straightforward to install (except for the<br />software license information), the real challenge is in the post- installation arena. The book has 14 chapters and, by Chapter 3 (page 34), the book is already into FireWall-<br />1. Other books often include up to 100 pages of filler on topics such as computer secrity, cryptography, threats, etc., and don't get to the main subject until half way through the<br />book. Chapter 4 of this book provides a thorough overview of how to build a rulebase. The chapter describes the various fields and objects that need to be created for the<br />firewall to be effective. Although the simplicity of the Check Point GUI is obvious, the definition of names, network objects, and so forth, must be carefully planned -- especially<br />for rollouts of FireWall-1 in large enterprise environments.<br />Chapter 8 provides an excellent overview of content security. FireWall-1 is built on its patented Stateful Inspection capabilities, but it has other security facilities including CVP<br />(Content Vectoring Protocol), UFP (URL Filtering Protocol), and others. The chapter describes much of the secondary content protection capabilities of FireWall-1. Such<br />capabilities are crucial in light of the volume of information that passes through corporate firewalls (including streaming media, email, files, Java, etc.).<br />Essential Checkpoint Firewall-1 covers all the crucial topics that any FireWall-1 administrator needs to know.

With the increase of both criminal and lawful cyber-activities, criminologists will pursue the question as to what motivates such people to break into various computer systems.<br />The Hacker Diaries - Confessions of Teenage Hackers - attempts to peer into the minds of some of the most celebrated hackers of the last few years.  Hacker personalities such as Joe Magee, Genocide, Anna Moore, MafiaBoy and more are detailed in this interesting book.  Verton is not an alarmist who hysterically views hackers as the bane of the world.  Rather, he attempts to portray hackers in a rational light, but never rationalizes their occasional criminal behavior.<br />Verton does a good job of giving the reader insights into what makes a teenager hack.  By and large, it is for a sense of adventure, plus a variety of internal and external societal pressures.<br />For those readers that are looking to understand why hackers do what they do, and understand it from both a criminal and psychological  perspective, or how to use the information to protect corporate networks, The Hacker Diaries is not the right book.

While some are small, many others were rather significant.  Innocuously, the author called the ICSA the NCSA, even though its name was changed over 4 years ago.

Get over it\\".  In World Without Secrets: Business, Crime and Privacy in the Age of Ubiquitous, author Richard Hunter spends 300 engrossing pages corroborating McNealy's observation.<br />The reality is that with advancements in computing and networking, personal privacy slowly gets chipped away, and as Hunter sees it, will ultimately deteriorate.  Hunter details in each chapter how the age of ubiquitous computing, where everything short of the food we eat has a network address, can be monitored.  Such technological advances creates a world where everything is known and all information is available; a world without secrets.<br />World Without Secrets takes a look at the implications that we are now facing with technology.  A cynical reader may think that the author is no more than a Chicken Little for the digital age; yet in page after page, and chapter after chapter, Hunter details examples of how technology can be both innocuously used and offensively manipulated, resulting in the potential for huge privacy breaches.<br />While most books on privacy and information focus on how corporations use and misuse personal data, World Without Secrets adds an interesting twist and provides insights into what Hunter calls Network Armies; which are groups of virtual communities, sharing a similar goal.  Hunter sees these Network Armies as starting points in the digital revolution.<br />The only downside to the book is that while Hunter does not provide any type of answer or resolution on how to better enable privacy in the digital age.  Perhaps there is no answer.<br />World Without Secrets presents a new look at the issues of privacy and technology.  Those who are paranoid may feel vindicated, and those who never understood the implications of technology and its repercussions on privacy may feel violated.

Kuo's role at Value America was that of Director of Corporate Communications, also known as mouthpiece to the chairman.  Value America was an early Internet retailer that crashed and burned quite quickly after its IPO in early 1999. The story of Value America is inherently the story of its founder and chairman, Craig Winn. Winn was the typical big vision salesman, one who could talk and impress people about the big picture, but couldn't execute things effectively.  Although Winn saw the potential of the Internet to transform all areas of commerce, especially the retail sector, his visions of greatness and riches never took flight.<br />Winn's mistake (of which there are many) was that he got caught up in his own hubris.  The sad part of the Value America debacle is that it really did have a chance to do something big -- really big.  But, as Kuo details in chapter after chapter, it was Winn who often got in the way of the company's ability to achieve its true potential. Kuo is a former political speech writer, and his sometime self-deprecating writing style is engaging and humorous, making the book difficult to put down.<br />The book starts with Kuo's arrival at Value America, and in just a few pages, we see that Value America had all of the trappings that ensured the demise of most dot.coms; hype, overpaid management who are detached from reality, executive jets, inconsistent and constantly changing strategies, lying and cheating, executive hubris, and a long list of unsatisfied customers. Ultimately, it was the overpowering and unbending personality<br />of Craig Winn that brought the company down.  In deference to Winn, it was much more than just his personality that brought down Value America; however, his personality, which was one of his greatest assets, was also his biggest detriment.<br />Craig Winn was one part businessman and one part preacher. His close ties with Jerry Falwell and Ralph Reed, as the book details, are no coincidence. Winn's ultimate vision was not just to create a multi-billion dollar company; he also set his sites on both the Governorship of Virginia and, ultimately, the United States presidency. Winn based his presidential aspirations on his meeting and conversations -- which were quite brief<br />-- with personalities such as William Bennett and Henry Kissinger.  (I once met Ray Manzarek, keyboardist for the Doors, in a Los Angeles supermarket, but  I left my aspirations for rock and roll stardom in aisle 5.  Perhaps if Winn would have done the same, and stayed in touch with reality, he might have been more than a momentary paper billionaire.)<br />As with any book written by an insider, one has to keep in mind the subjective nature of Kuo's narrative. Nonetheless, as someone who has worked internally and as a consultant at several dot.com startups, I found that much of the book sounded familiar and believable.<br />Although the story of Value America is somewhat dated in Internet time, it still is a fascinating read of how something so right could go so wrong.preacher.

His pure intellect is what enabled him to code for days at a time and develop the concept of free software. It enabled him to execute those ideas in classic pieces of software such as the Emacs editor, EDMA modular development environment, GCC compiler, and much more... But although Stallman's intellectual prowess was clearly genius material, his inability to effectively deal with people and his need to macro-manage alienated many of those around him. Williams cites an incident wherein a dinner guest innocuously uttered the phrase \\"God forbid,\\" to which Stallman replied, \\"I hate to break it to you, but there is no God.\\" Such utterances are indicative of Stallman's inner demons, many of which are related to the fact that he likely suffers from Asberger syndrome. (Asberger syndrome is one of the disorders on the autistic spectrum. For a fascinating look at how Asberger syndrome affects an inordinately high number of people in the technology industry, see \\"The Geek Syndrome\\"..<br />Whereas Stallman is an acutely individualistic person who, in his early days, simply wanted to be left alone to code, Linus Torvalds is a much more personable and pleasant person. That trait alone is not what made Linux so ubiquitous, but it is a key reason why the operating system is known as Linux, and not GNU/Linux -- much to Stallman's chagrin. Williams describes numerous instances wherein Stallman chastised him for inadvertently using the term Linux and not GNU/Linux.<br />The book's epilogue does indeed decipher what it was that drove Stallman to free software: crushing loneliness. Williams details the connection between loneliness on a physical and spiritual level to loneliness on a hacker level. The impulse to share code is about friendship, albeit on a low level. Stallman admits that loneliness, or the fear of perpetual loneliness, played a major role in fueling his determination during the earliest days of the GNU project. Fortunately for Stallman, he eventually found love and a soul mate in a woman named Sarah.<br />The best biography is in fact an autobiography, but Stallman would likely never pen his own memoirs.

When the first edition of Web Security, Privacy & Commerce came out in 1997, it was titled Web Security & Commerce.  Not only has the title changed, but Web security, privacy, and commerce have changed radically in the last five years.<br />The nature of the change and the pace at which it occurs is a large part of the difficulty within information security.  Imagine a heart surgeon going on an extended vacation in 1997 and coming back in 2002.  Although his surgical technique may be a bit rusty, there is no reason to think that he could not start practicing medicine again right away. However, if you were to take a contemporary information security professional from 1997 and place him in the 2002 workplace, he would be horribly outdated.  Technologies that did not exist in 1997, or even 2000, are now ubiquitous, and technologies that were considered cutting edge only a few years ago are now archaic.<br />With that, the update to Web Security, Privacy & Commerce is indeed warranted and welcomed.  A glance at the table of contents reveals coverage of nearly every core aspect within Web security.  The book provides a comprehensive and impartial look at the technologies and approaches that both management and systems administrators can employ to ensure the security of their networks and systems.  The author's impartiality is revealed in chapter 15, which describes several telephone scanner utilities; Garfinkel is the creator of one of the utilities, but makes sure to list the competition (and even has nice things to say about them).<br />Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford are veterans in the computer security world.  Garfinkel is the author of several highly acclaimed books, and Spafford is a professor of computer science at Purdue University.  Their succinct writing style allows them to cover a huge amount of information in a little over 700 pages.<br />The book is divided into four sections: Web technology, privacy and security for users, Web server security, and security for content providers.  Part one goes into details about the security foundations of the networks and the Internet. Topics include SSL/TLS, PKI, digital signatures, and biometrics.  These seven chapters give the reader a good overview of the essence of information security.<br />Part 2, \\"Privacy and Security for Users,\\" is quite different from other security books.  Whereas other books detail the problems with privacy on the Internet, this book does a good job of showing users various strategies for keeping their personal information private.  Garfinkel shows how the real threats to personal privacy are not so much cookies and log files; rather the end-users very own readiness to provide Web and e-commerce sites with their personal information.<br />Part 3, \\"Web Server Security,\\" details how service providers and systems administrators can lock down and secure their systems.  The authors provide details on topics such as host security, server access methods, and secure CGI/API programming.<br />Part 4, \\"Security for Content Providers,\\" is quite interesting, as many content providers and ISPs forget that the onus of security and privacy to a large degree falls on them.  This section includes details on how these providers can use various techniques, from filters to PICS and more, to ensure their users' privacy.<br />The fact that Web Security, Privacy & Commerce, 2nd Edition, is nearly twice the size of the first edition is indicative of the fact that security has changed radically since 1997.

Garfinkel shows how the real threats to personal privacy are not so much cookies and log files; rather the end-users very own readiness to provide Web and e-commerce sites with their personal information. <br />Part 3, \\"Web Server Security,\\" details how service providers and systems administrators can lock down and secure their systems.  The authors provide details on topics such as host security, server access methods, and secure CGI/API programming. <br />Part 4, \\"Security for Content Providers,\\" is quite interesting, as many content providers and ISPs forget that the onus of security and privacy to a large degree falls on them.  This section includes details on how these providers can use various techniques, from filters to PICS and more, to ensure their users' privacy. <br />The fact that Web Security, Privacy & Commerce, 2nd Edition, is nearly twice the size of the first edition is indicative of the fact that security has changed radically since 1997. Whether you run a Web site or are concerned about security for your PC at home, Web Security, Privacy & Commerce is a must read.	2002-03-19

While I was initially intrigued by the title of this book, I was a little disappointed to find the author already apologizing for the title in the preface.  Ill be honest with you, I was pretty unhappy with the text of his apology.<br />The author writes that there is probably no such thing as a completely bulletproof network and networked host.  With the authors extensive talents and expertise in the field of information security, he should have unmistakably stated that there is unequivocally no such thing as a completely bulletproof network and networked host.<br />The difference is crucial, since even items that are advertised in Security Management as bulletproof, are only bulletproof for a limited number of bullets on a restricted surface.  As corporate networks are exceedingly complex, there is clearly no way to make them bulletproof.  Despite the fact that more and more is being spent on information systems security, things are getting more and more complex, and complex systems are much harder to protect.<br />With that, Bulletproofing TCP/IP-Based Windows NT/2000 Networks nonetheless does provide a decent overview of various threats and attacks that anyone running Windows NY and 2000 servers should be aware of.<br />Unfortunately, only about 45 pages of the book actually deal with topics that are unique to Windows NT & 2000.  The other parts of the book are much more generic and unfocused on Windows.<br />While the book does have a lot of worthwhile information; its lack of Windows specific information, combined with its steep price...makes its purchase a hard sell.	2002-03-12

Know Your Enemy is unique is that it is written in the first person.  The book is a chronicle of The Honeynet Project; which is a group of security professionals dedicated to learning the tools, tactics and motives of hackers in order to share what they have learned from those encounters.  The group was formed due to the every growing complexity of today's networks, and that no single individual has the complete set of skills necessary to understand the forensics behind computer attacks.<br />The book centers around honey pots and honey network that the Honeynet Project designed.  A honey pot is a computer designed to look like something that an intruder can hack into.  One example of a honey pot is to install a machine on a network with no particular purpose other than to log all attempted accesses to it.  Similarly, a honeynet is a network designed to be compromised.<br />The function of the honeynet is that when attackers probe, attack and attempt to hack a system, the administrators of the honeynet are able to observe all of their activities, and use that knowledge to design stronger systems. By building such a network and understanding the scope attacks against it, one can understand their adversary, and can better protect their corporate information systems assets.<br />The book is divided into three parts.  The first part shows how the group planned and built the Honeynet.  The second part goes into an in-depth analysis of the logs gathered during attacks.  While part 3 looks at the threats, motives and tools that the enemy employs in their attacks.<br />The book is written by technical experts, but in a language that doesn't require a strong technical background.  The book effectively shows how a hacker thinks and operates.  Most often than not, the hacker simply bypasses the normal security mechanism in place.  Know Your Enemy takes all of the lessons learned from hundreds of attacks against the honeynet and shows how to better design systems that is resilient against attack.<br />Know Your Enemy is not only an extremely important security book, it is a fascinating read.  For any security practitioner wants to truly understand the risks their networks face on a daily basis, Know Your Enemy is a must read.the lessons learned from hundreds of attacks against the honeynet and shows how to better design systems that is resilient against attack.  <br />Know Your Enemy is not only an extremely important security book, it is a fascinating read.

But once a company moves their storefront from small-town Main Street to the often-dangerous alleyways of the Information superhighway, there is a plethora of security and privacy issues that arise.  But for many companies, they will take action on those security and privacy issues only after a security breach has occurred.<br />Security and Privacy for E-Business provides readers with a to get the point look at the issues involved in protecting an e-business from security threats, while having to simultaneously deal with their customer's privacy issues.<br />As Security Management readers know, the Internet is no longer a toy for academia. Billion dollar money transfers, transmission of patient data and other critical actions take place on the Internet daily.  Without an effective security infrastructure, companies will find themselves with huge liabilities.<br />Anup Ghosh does a good job of showing how to build security into e-commerce systems.  His style is ideal for those that don't have a background in security.  At a little over 200 pages, readers will find enough information to give them a good introduction without being overly technical and abstract.<br />One of the author's areas of expertise is with writing secure software, and this is discussed at length in Chapter 3, where the book really comes alive.  Ghosh's mantra throughout the book is that when it comes to e-commerce security, it's all about the software.  Ghosh speaks at length about the need for effective engineering in the software development process.  He lists numerous areas in the development cycle where security can be easily compromised, and it is in those areas where companies must ensure is secure.<br />While the book has privacy it its title, its coverage of privacy, while not as deep as I would have liked is valuable nonetheless.<br />Those needing a way to defend their networks against internal and external threats will find the book to be quite beneficial.o defend their networks against internal and external threats will find the book to be quite beneficial.	2002-03-12

Confronting the Limits of Our Legal System in the Age of Cyberspace	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Excellent overview of various Internet and legal issues	When the ancient Israelites wandered through the desert, their sustenance was from a food called Manna. In Hebrew, the word Manna comes from the root of two words that mean What is It?<br />When it comes to the Internet, many legalists look at this system of interconnected networks and ask, What is it? This topic is the theme of Stuart Biegel's timely and well-written book, Beyond Our Control? Biegel writes from real-world experience; he is an attorney and teaches cyber law at UCLA. While the lawyers and legal scholars consult case law and their legalistic tomes, Beyond Our Control provides non-lawyers with tremendous background on the issues now surrounding our legal systems and the Internet.<br />One of the questions the book tackles is whether the Internet and cyberspace is a revolutionary new medium requiring its own set of legal policies, or if it is simply an evolutionary technology that can exist under current legal regulations. The question is significant, as such differences can determine whether or not a song downloaded from the Internet is a criminal offense, who has jurisdiction when a threatening email is transmitted, and the legal nature of a distributed denial of service attack.<br />There is a common perception that the Internet is a like the uncontrolled wastelands of the Wild West, and Biegel uses the Wild West analogy to compare the Internet to movies such as Shane, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and Cimarron. It is important to note that Biegel astutely asserts that it is generally agreed that the Wild West imagery of popular culture comes not from the history books, but from the western films. Beigel quotes historian Jim Kites, who describes the excitement that many find in the Wild West (and equally with the Internet) by saying, it is placed at exactly that moment when options are still open, the dream of primitivistic individualism, the ambivalence of at once beneficent and threatening horizons, are still open... For many involved in cyberspace (especially in the open source movement), they see the Internet as a place where such options are still open.<br />Yet, the romantic notion of the Internet has often run head long into the law. A main theme of the book centers on how to deal with P2P file sharing, such as MP3 files through Napster and Gnutella. For users, such a practice was considered an extension of their own music libraries; for the RIAA, it was outright thievery. This ease of use in downloading music caused an uproar among music executives and the ultimate demise of Napster as a corporate entity.<br />Yet while many perceive cyberspace as unregulated, Biegel shows that although there are not as many laws for cyberspace as there are for aviation, for example, cyberspace is nonetheless significantly regulated. Biegel shows how the Federal Trade Commission has transformed itself from a sleepy back-office establishment in Washington, DC, to a protector of consumers on the Internet. The book describes the success of the FTC in fighting cyber crime, which flies in the face of the non-regulated cyberspace myth. Biegel shows how cyberspace has been regulated in a very stringent fashion by the FTC and how consumer protection laws are working there. Biegel also notes that there are more U.S. laws governing copying in the online world than most people even realize.<br />The book takes a look at how the Internet can and should be regulated. The question of International law also comes up, and Beigel notes that some people believe the Internet isn't truly a global medium at all, but simply an extension of the United States. With that, the question of International law regulating an entity that is controlled by the United States becomes interesting.<br />My only personal criticism of the book is Biegel's use of the term Netizens to describe users of the Internet. Personally, I don't think cyberspace users should have their own taxonomy any more than those who use cell phones.<br />Although some readers of may opine that they have little value in reading about the current state of cyber law, I strongly recommend reading Beyond Our Control. Most of us may not be lawyers, but the topics in the book -- cyber-security, consumer fraud, free speech rights, intellectual property rights, file-sharing programs, and more -- affect us all.eaders of may opine that they have little value in reading about the current state of cyber law, I strongly recommend reading Beyond Our Control.

In that vein, there are plenty of computer books in print that comprise more than 1000 pages, cover every topic under the sun, and include a CD-ROM with often-obsolete freeware tools.  Such tomes are often a waste of time and money because the contents are primarily filler with little added value.<br />Solaris 8 Security, on the other hand, provides a very good overview of Solaris security without the bulk of unnecessary and often extraneous information.  The book covers a lot of ground. The author covers key issues involved with the various aspects of securing Solaris systems, but does not get bogged down in page-wasting minutiae.<br />The first three chapters provide a good introduction to basic security, cryptography, and system security issues.  Chapter 4 gives a good synopsis of the authentication and authorization facilities in Solaris 8.  The chapter includes information about the basics, such as etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, and the new RBAC (Role Based Access Control) functionality that is available in Solaris 8.  In the past, RBAC was only available on Trusted Solaris; now it is included in standard versions of Solaris 8 and above.<br />RBAC attempts to solve the problem of network users having far more network access than is necessary.  The fact is that most existing networks allow users to access 10 to 20 times more resources than they will ever use or need.  Because authorized users commit roughly 80% of computer crime, providing too much access is a huge security risk.  So how does a systems administrator reduce overall user permissions by 70-90%, while providing users with the necessary access on a need-to-know and need-to-do basis?  RBAC.<br />Further chapters in Solaris 8 Security deal with Kerberos, auditing and accounting, and open source security tools. Chapters 8 through 10 conclude the book with overviews of network security and IPSec. Chapter 8 has some very helpful hints on fine-tuning the Solaris 8 TCP/IP stack via various configuration tools and files.  Chapter 10 details how to secure various network services including HTTP and NFS.<br />Anyone looking for a well-focused book on Solaris security should take a look at Solaris 8 Security .

It elevated the status and importance of the coroner. However, the speed at which Quincy was able to find answers was utterly unrealistic. By and large, within forensics -- be it computer or human forensics -- answers are found with slow, deliberate, and methodical steps, not in the undisciplined manner that is often portrayed in the media.<br />In light of the growing number of computer crime incidents, computer forensics is taking on a critical role within information systems. The focus of computer forensics is twofold. First is the attempt to determine whether a breach has occurred and, if so, to determine the offender. Second is prosecution of the offender, if the breach was a criminal activity. With current information technology, the first part is easier, while prosecuting a computer criminal remains extremely difficult.<br />The criticality of a specific topic is often portrayed in the number of titles that are available on that topic. Late 2001 and early 2002 have produced nearly a dozen books on computer forensics and cyber crime. Although computer forensics is becoming a mainstream topic, the fact that more books are being published on the subject does not mean in any way that the problem will go away quickly. With this in mind, the Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation provides information on dealing with cyber crime. Each book approaches the subject from a different angle.<br />Eoghan Casey's Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation: Forensic Tools & Technology is an excellent work. The book has articles written by 17 authors with expertise in different areas of computer crime and forensics. The authors are from the fields of law enforcement and professional services, as well as computer forensic software firms. The editor, Eoghan Casey, does a good job of keeping a coherent and logical sequence throughout the book, which is often difficult in books with multiple authors.<br />The variety of authors is what makes this book shine. Each author addresses a specific subject matter, and the chapters are written in a clear and concise fashion. The chapters on wireless networks and embedded systems -- critical topics in a forensic investigation -- are excellent. The Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation is one of the first books to include basic forensic information on these topics.<br />The Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation was written to complement Casey's preceding book Digital Evidence and Computer Crime (Academic Press 2000; ISBN: 012162885X). The Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation provides different looks on the proper course of digital forensic collection. The \\"Case Examples\\" sections are extremely valuable because they provide readers with examples of the technical and legal issues that arise in real-world computer investigations.<br />The book includes sections written by forensic tool vendors. The vendors do a good job of writing in a technical nature rather than marketing hype. The general consensus between the three books is that the EnCase software tool from Guidance Software ([...]) has become the tool for use in computer forensic investigations.s. <br />The variety of authors is what makes this book shine.

Half of the book (Appendix G) is simply a printout of the US Department of Justice Search and Seizure Guidelines. Although the guidelines are required reading, one should not have to pay for information that is available for free on the Department of Justice Web site.

The chapter includes a good section on how criminals use unallocated space on a hard drive for data storage that is often missed by forensic examiners.<br />Chapters 8 through 11 examine the details of Windows and Unix system investigations. The two operating systems are obviously different, so the examiner must know how to perform the specific tasks in each environment.<br />Chapter 12 closes the book with an introduction to the Criminal Justice system. This is important if the gathered evidence is to be used in a court of law. Although he or she needn't be a lawyer, the examiner must know what the lawyers will most likely attack, so as to ensure the evidence can indeed be used in court.	2002-01-30

Ranum states that if you haven't got a security policy, you haven't got a firewall.  Instead, you've got a thing that's sort of doing something, but you don't know what it's trying to do because no one has told you what it should do.  Ranum's observation is supported by the fact that while computer security is not so new, the publication of Writing Information Security Policies didn't happen until late 2001.<br />In many ways, information security policies are like fiber (fiber the grain, not the telecommunications medium); we all agree that it is necessary and beneficial, but only a small number of people actually take action on it.  One of the many reasons why information security is in dire straits is that these policies are generally not given the value they deserve.  On the whole, for information security to be effective, it must be given the same level of importance and corporate high-level attention as policies about sexual harassment.  Organizations have sexual harassment policies because they can't afford the bad publicity and the risks and costs involved with litigation.<br />By way of example, in any Fortune 500 company, an employee who misappropriates the email system to send sexually or racially harassing email is nearly guaranteed a pink slip; however, if that same employee shares the password to his email account, there is a much higher level of tolerance.  In fact, one is hard pressed to find a case where an employee has been terminated for such an information security offense. Information security policies must be treated with the same level of importance as sexual harassment policies in order for any company to achieve effective information security.<br />Scott Barman has done a wonderful job of writing a succinct book that addresses all the vital areas where security policies are required in an organization.  The book explores the various caveats of information technology (physical security, authentication and network security, Internet, encryption, etc.) and concisely details appropriate policies for each technology domain.  Security policies are typically not exciting reading, but Barman spices up the text with many real-world scenarios from his experience in the field.<br />Barman starts on the right foot when he advocates performing a risk assessment and audit. He notes that a risk assessment is crucial to an effective information security infrastructure, and the only way to understand your infrastructure is to perform a full risk assessment and audit.  By performing the assessment, information security policy writers can obtain a greater understanding of the reach of information technology within their organization.<br />At fewer than 200 pages, Writing Information Security Policies is a concise work that will provide valuable assistance to anyone starting information security policy endeavors.  The only thing missing is a CD-ROM or companion Web site in which to download many of the well-written policy texts in the book.  Aside from that omission, the book is a great way to jump-start an information security policy initiative and should be required reading for anyone who wants to ensure real security in their company.<br />It remains to be seen how many companies will indeed take the necessary steps to create their own set of information security policies.

But many companies do not have any type of formal security policy in place. After perusing this book, one will quickly see how it will become indispensable for anyone earnestly interested in developing operative security policies. The beauty of the book is that it does all of the dirty work (the writing and organization of policies) and frees staff to design a methodology in which to deploy the policies.<br />The first 50 pages introduce the art of policy writing. Author Charles Cresson Wood notes that while it is tempting to immediately cut and paste policies together, it is imperative to understand the complex information security policy development process. This process includes writing policies, editing policies, obtaining management approval, communicating policies, and implementing controls to meet the policy requirements.<br />Before getting into the more than 1,000 policies contained here, the book includes a checklist that details the steps associated with the development, refinement, and approval of an information security policy methodology. After going through the introduction and checklist, one will likely be proficient at policy implementation.<br />While some may balk at the book's ... price tag, it is reasonable given the breadth of the material and the staff time required to develop a set of information system policies. At fifty cents per policy, the guide is a good deal.<br />Every few years a book is published that quickly becomes an indispensable reference. Information Security Policies Made Easy is one of those books and should be part of every organization that is serious about information systems security.	2001-12-27

From the water floatation safety cushions to the oxygen masks, it's the cabin crew's duty to ensure that every passenger is briefed. Why is this safety briefing so vital? Because when a passenger is gasping for air at 39,000 feet, it is unlikely that they will get a response when they press the flight attendant call button.<br />In many ways, computer incident response is akin to airplane safety; you need to know<br />what to expect when the inevitable occurs. If an organization attempts to manage things<br />ex post facto -- whether it is a depressurization at cruise level or a hack attack - their response will invariably fail. As such, the need for IT-based incident response strategy is<br />crucial.<br />Why is incident response a necessity? According to data from the Computer Security<br />Institute (and backed-up by many other security surveys), more than 70% of businesses<br />reported security breaches in the year 2000. While 70% may have answered the survey<br />affirmatively, the reality is that every business on the planet has security breaches. It's<br />simply a matter of how effectively they handle the incident. System and network hacks<br />are to be expected; how well they are handled, and how the damage is mitigated is up to<br />the organizations and their respective incident response teams.<br />Although I used the airline example, the authors of Incident Response compare it to fire<br />fighting. Incident response is akin to firefighting in that it involves the coordination of<br />various disciplines, namely: prevention, planning, detection, analysis, containment,<br />investigation, eradication, and post-incident analysis.<br />The difference between a fire and incident response is that whereas a fire can be<br />extinguished with perhaps one or two of the controls just mentioned, effective incident<br />response requires that all eight of the controls be effectively carried out. Another<br />difference between firefighting and incident response is that humanity has thousands of<br />years of experience in putting out fires. Computer security, however, has only been<br />around for a few decades. From an incident response perspective, the CERT/CC<br />(Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center) is only 13 years old. The<br />fact that Smokey the Bear is older than information security and incident response should<br />be humbling to those in technology.<br />The problem within many elements of corporate information technology is that they don't<br />understand the intricacies involved with incident response. With that, Incident Response<br />provides a non-technical introduction to the rudiments of setting up an incident response<br />team. Many technology managers don't know the difference between Certs candy and<br />the CERT organization. For those managers, this book will be a good start toward<br />teaching them how to deal with the inevitable.<br />Overall, Incident Response is a thorough introduction to incident response. The authors<br />go into detail about defining what an incident is and analyzing its various components to<br />show how a multi-disciplinary approach is required to rectify the situation. Those of us<br />in technology easily understand the need for incident response; unfortunately, many IT<br />managers think that incident response can be handled in a much more informal and<br />unofficial way. Such an erroneous management attitude will only lead to many<br />undetected security incidents.<br />Although Forno and Van Wyk give a good overview of incident response, the topic is far<br />too broad to be thoroughly covered in this monograph alone. For those who need a deeper<br />and more technical look at incident response and its associated field of computer<br />forensics, the following books will likely be beneficial:<br />·  Incident Response: A Strategic Guide to Handling System and Network Security<br />Breaches by Russell Shumway &amp; Gene Schultz, New Riders Publishing 2002;<br />ISBN: 1578702569 2002<br />·  Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime by Chris Prosise &amp; Kevin<br />Mandia, McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing 2001; ISBN: 0072131829<br />·  Computer Forensics -- Incident Response Essentials by Warren Kruse &amp; Jay<br />Heiser, Addison-Wesley 2001, ISBN: 0201707195.Schultz, New Riders Publishing 2002;<BR>ISBN: 1578702569 2002<BR>·  Incident Response: Investigating Computer Crime by Chris Prosise &amp; Kevin<BR>Mandia, McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing 2001; ISBN: 0072131829<BR>·  Computer Forensics -- Incident Response Essentials by Warren Kruse &amp; Jay<BR>Heiser, Addison-Wesley 2001, ISBN: 0201707195.	2001-12-19

Fortunately, what the book lacks in flashy titles, it makes up in interesting content. CyberRegs is an engrossing and sometimes angry look at the perverse nature of patent law.<br />When many people think of the Internet and e-commerce, they think of a series of open and non-proprietary standards that enable computers to speak networking Esperanto. As the book shows, that does not necessarily jive with reality. Many companies have tried to homestead on pioneering technologies and use them to gain a lock on the market. Author Bill Zoellick cites numerous cases -- many still in litigation -- to illustrate this point.<br />The book starts with a brief background of the nature of copyright and patent law and doesnt assume any type of legal background or expertise. Zoellicks writing style is easy going but to the point, and he accomplishes his goal of examining the disruption and instability that the Web has introduced into the world of intellectual property.<br />Zoellick looks at the Web from many different perspectives, from business and legal to technological and political. While some may think they don't need a book about Internet law and regulations, the reality is that, for any organization doing business on the Internet, there exists the strong possibility that they may be infringing on someone elses intellectual property rights.<br />One of the most controversial issues that the book looks at is one-click patents issued to Amazon.com. The one-click patents preclude any Internet business that has not licensed the technology from Amazon.com from enabling their customers to complete their purchasing experience with a single mouse click. The question of whether one-click is even patentable is a controversial one. Those who say it is,  feel that Amazon.com is protecting a vital business asset. Those who dont support it say that it only serves to stifle productivity. Zoellick gives numerous other examples.<br />CyberRegs also goes into such issues as digital signature and privacy. Zoellick does not take sides, but  provides a fair-minded look at the debate between greater and lesser control of privacy and the Internet. The book also tackles such controversial topics as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Napster and DeCSS.<br />In part 3, Zoellick provides an excellent overview of digital certificates. He goes into detail on the parameters around the groundbreaking E-SIGN (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce) act. Many have complained that E-SIGN is extremely light on details and specifics, which it is.However,  Zoellick says that with E-SIGN,  Congress took the approach that we dont really understand how to do business on the Internet so issues surrounding authentication of electronic signatures are not necessarily easy problems to solve.With that, Congress restricted government action to the parts of the problem where they are directly involved and required.Congress recognized that for any effective solution, markets need time to develop and patience is required. Although this approach is hard when dealing with Internet time, it is nonetheless necessary.<br />You dont have to be a lawyer to appreciate CyberRegs. Anyone who wants to have a business presence on the Net should read this book so as  not to get  involved in a legal tussle. While John Grisham may own the legal fiction market, CyberRegs is as close to a non-fiction legal thriller as you can get.to stifle productivity.

Now many companies have a VoIP (Voice Over IP) PBX via their Cisco routers. Some organizations have separate VON (Voice Over Network) systems. While the benefits of convergence are many, their security implications are often ignored or, when they are considered, are addressed too far along into the development process.<br />That convergence is the focus of Voice and Data Security. About a third of the book addresses the fundamentals of voice and data security, covering topics such as cryptography, sniffing, and spoofing. The rest of the book deals with securing digital and voice assets.<br />As an example, PBX and mail fraud are huge problems facing corporate America. Yet while most companies are aware of the situation, many organizations don't do all they can to secure their voice systems. This book contains an excellent policy and audit checklist on how to set up a corporate PBX policy. Items such as protection management, standards and procedures, technical safeguards, and incident response are discussed in the checklist, which alone is worth the cost of the book.<br />A single unauthorized modem in a corporate network will undermine firewalls, cryptography, and all other protection mechanisms. Thus, the authors cover how war dialers and telephone line scanners can be used to ensure that the back doors that unauthorized corporate modems create are closed.<br />Voice and Data Security is valuable to those needing a good introduction to the core ideas and security repercussions involved with the convergence of voice and data systems. It speaks volumes.	2001-11-20

Although point security is necessary, it does not provide the necessary level of security unless the varied points are integrated. This year, a number of security books have bucked the point-security-only trend and have concentrated on security from an integrated architecture perspective.  The most noteworthy of these titles has been Ross Anderson's Security Engineering.<br />Another worthy title is Counter Hack: A Step-by-Step Guide to Computer Attacks and Effective Defenses.  The self-described Next Generation Hacker Book promises to be \\"a step-by-step guide to defending against hacker intrusions.\\"  Rather than focusing on a single technology to secure, Skoudis shows readers how to design and defend their networks against myriad threats.  His step-by-step approach is to partition the hacking process into five phases (Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, Covering Tracks, and Hiding) and to detail the steps within each phase.<br />As noted by Anderson in Security Engineering, most systems are designed to keep out the \\"good guys\\" --those who follow the rules but may occasionally bypass them.  Hackers and other adversaries -- who do not follow the rules -- require a unique set of constraints to keep them out of corporate networks.<br />The book opens with a crucial topic: knowing your threats and not underestimating your adversary.  Although most people may put all adversaries under the blanket class of \\"hackers,\\" there are a number of antagonistic groups, each of which possesses a unique set of threats. Unless an organization knows who its adversaries are -- whether internal employees (the true cause of most security incidents), organized crime, disgruntled consultants, remote hackers, customers, suppliers, or hactivists -- there is no way its network can be appropriately secured. Counter Hack details what course of action to take in order to protect against attacks, whether they originate from a low-level script kiddy or a world-class hacker.<br />Skoudis' step-by-step approach to effectively securing a network begins with an introduction to the operations of TCP/IP.  Most experienced readers can bypass this section.  The next two chapters provide an overview of Unix and Windows NT/2000, which are the most commonly installed operating systems in corporate America.  Although most security books address Windows NT/2000 and Windows PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), Skoudis astutely notes the huge security ramifications of running them.<br />The following sections detail how hackers perform reconnaissance and scanning attacks against networks in order to penetrate them.  Skoudis details the fundamentals of port scanning and the use of scanning tools such as nmap.<br />Chapter 7 covers applications and operating-system-level attacks.  It includes an excellent overview of buffer-overflow attacks and how to obviate them.  This is a crucial point for programmers who are often unaware of the specific dangers of buffer overflows.<br />The book details the dangers of Trojan horses, backdoors, and root kits, which are often difficult to detect once they are installed.  Skoudis covers the nastiest backdoor, kernel-level root kits, and execution redirection in particular.  The danger of execution redirection is that the hacker can intercept a call to run a certain application and map that call to another application .  It is basically a bait-and-switch attack, except that the victims do not know that they are being attacked.<br />Skoudis has an easy-to-read style.  When he mentions a hacking tool, he effectively describes how the tool works and how it can be employed to secure a system.  Skoudis also includes a number of stories written in the first-person.  It is a pleasure to read a security book written by a professional who has in-the-trenches experience, as opposed to someone who thinks copying RFC's makes for an original book.<br />If you have a network connected to the Internet, you will inevitably be hacked.  This book shows how to avert such attacks with a counter hack.  For a wide-ranging overview of how to secure a system against myriad adversaries, do yourself, your employer, and your networks a favor and read Counter Hack.rience, as opposed to someone who thinks copying RFC's makes for an original book. <br />If you have a network connected to the Internet, you will inevitably be hacked.

But even before a prototype of the Sonic Cruiser takes to the skies, tens of thousands of hours will have been spent on design, planning, testing, legal, administrative, and other tasks.<br />The product development scenario for information technology and information security is radically different.  Corporate networks are being rolled out with planning and design that is not on par with that of our counterparts in the aviation and construction industries.  In fact, already complex corporate networks are continuously becoming more byzantine.  Take an average MIS department and add up all their hardware vendors, network topologies and protocols, operating systems, software add-ons, and custom-written applications.  Now try to securely integrate them. If security was not designed into the original system architecture, how can these security products be expected to work?  Despite the fact that companies are spending more and more money on information systems security, the systems are growing more and more complex -- and complex systems are much harder to protect.<br />Security Architecture: Design, Deployment and Operations, is intended to help readers design and deploy better security technologies.  The authors believe that security architecture must be comprehensive, because a network that is 98% secure is actually 100% insecure.  This is especially true, given that -- contrary to popular belief -- information security is not a pure science, but a mixture of art and science.<br />Effective information security must encompass every aspect of the enterprise.  Security Architecture shows how to design a secure infrastructure.  It addresses all of the major security products and provides details on how to deploy them.<br />The authors incisively write that it is not enough for security professionals to understand the theory behind information security; unless they are able to insert security controls in the proper places within an application (data flows, storage and processing), the security solution will not be effective. A security product that is implemented incorrectly is like medicine that is taken improperly: great in potential, but futile in reality.<br />In addition, if the inserted security solution is not managed with the proper processes in place (e.g., change management, separation of duties, notification, and escalation), the level of security provided will degrade with time until the control becomes ineffective.<br />The book covers all of the fundamentals of information security.  Particularly noteworthy is Chapter 3, &quot;Information Classification and Access Control Plan.&quot;  As companies place more of their corporate data jewels on often-untrusted public networks, the lack of an information classification scheme can have significant negative security consequences.  Also, access control is critical in that many organizations -- and even the media -- are busy obsessing about remote hackers from foreign countries and have become oblivious to the real threats to information security: insiders.  While it is much more romantic to think about foreigners hacking into your system in the middle of the night, the reality is that most breaches occur via insiders during normal business hours.<br />The authors of Security Architecture discuss the elements needed to design and deploy effective information security architecture.  Critical security products such as PKI, firewalls, VPN, IDS, and others are discussed, but cryptographic accelerators are not mentioned.<br />This book highlights best practices and security standards and guidelines for effectively securing an enterprise.  The book is well organized and easy to read.  Many chapters have additional references and URL's for further research.<br />The inclusion of numerous case studies, combined with the authors' real-world experience, makes Security Architecture a valuable reference.  No one would ever want to get on a plane that had not been properly designed and tested.  Neither should we want to use networks that have not been adequately designed and tested from a security standpoint.  Security Architecture is intended to make sure that doesn't happen.eference.

It turns out that their biggest concern was \\"making sure the network is hackerproof.\\" I?ll ignore for now the fact that there is no such word as hackerproof; I?ll take license and substitute the term bulletproof, which dictionary.com informally defines as impervious to assault, damage, or failure; guaranteed.<br />With that, can network security and commercial off-the-shelf operating systems ever be impervious to assault, damage, or failure? Not even the largest seller of security snake oil would say yes to such a statement. Information security adversaries are already at the gate, posing legitimate threats; it is not a question of if networks will be attacked, but when. It is within this framework that Bob Toxen presents Real World Linux Security, a superb overview of how to comprehensively secure a Linux system.<br />Toxen is one of the original developers of Berkeley Unix, and his book is full of interesting historical tidbits from the computer science halls of UC Berkeley in the early 1970s. When it comes to Unix security, Toxen?s mantra is certainly \\"been there, done that.\\" Toxen is one of a very few writers who can write in the first person about developing operating systems while dropping names such as Bill Joy and Ken Thompson.<br />Although it comprises nearly 700 pages, Real World Linux Security is light on filler and bursting with important information on how to secure a Linux host. In reference to space filler, other books often have about a third of their content made up of screen prints and source code listing. Toxen's book fortunately does not use that route and instead directs readers to either a Web site or the companion CD-ROM for source code. The book is useful for all flavors of Linux, yet nearly all of the topics can be applied to other operating systems as well, because the threats are basically the same -- only the common line usage changes.<br />At page 25 -- where many other security books would still be addressing abstract ideas about computer security -- Real World Linux Security deals with Linux?s \\"Seven Most Deadly Sins.\\" Some of them are: weak passwords, old software versions, open network ports, and poor physical security. Just a few of the other critical security topics covered in the book are: common break-ins by subsystem, establishing security policies, hardening your system, and scanning your system for anomalies.<br />While much of the book is akin to \\"Linux Security 101,\\" advanced topics and defenses are also covered. The wide-ranging topics of the book include not only Linux host security, but also what to do when an intrusion has occurred. Part 4 of the book is \\"Recovering From an Intrusion.\\" The knee-jerk response of many systems administrators is to power down a system in the event of an intrusion. However, in reality, that is often the worst thing to do. Powering-down a system makes digital forensics much more difficult. A methodical and planned approach to intrusions is required, and the book details the appropriate steps to use.<br />The book comes with a CD that has a lot of useful programs and custom-written scripts. The CD-ROM includes most of the popular security tools including, nmap, crack, tcpdump, snort, and more. Although most of the software is freeware and available on the Internet, having all of the tools on a single CD-ROM is a timesaver.<br />The only complaint I have about the book is the use of skulls for the danger level. One skull indicates a minor effect or risk, while five skulls means the risk is too dangerous. It is often hard to discern whether the skulls refer to the topic just mentioned, or the subsequent one.<br />While many of the threats and vulnerabilities in the book indeed have five skulls, Real World Linux Security deserves five stars. It is an excellent reference about Linux security -- a topic that, while timely, does not always get the respect it deserves.s not always get the respect it deserves.	2001-10-14

On the hacker's uniform are the names of various computer tools and vulnerabilities, such as Ping of Death. Lined up opposite the hacker is a group of eight much smaller information security professionals. This picture effectively displays the nature of information security today: a lone powerful hacker attempting to break through the (often weak) overmatched defensive line of information security.<br />But author Aviel D. Rubin does not rely on cute illustrations alone. A noted security educator and researcher, Rubin collects his experiences in the information security arena in this book and provides an excellent field guide to the fundamentals of securing computer systems against attack. Rubin gives a solid overview of each security problem; he then provides advice and refers the reader to additional resources for deeper analysis and understanding, all in easy-to-read prose. While Rubin has a Ph.D., his writing style is decidedly unacademic, and he never talks down to the reader.<br />Most of the chapters begin by giving the reader a real-world introduction to the problem at hand. Rubin then elaborates on the various technologies and solutions involved. Most chapters also include a case study, which helps to make these esoteric security concepts more understandable.<br />Rubin also succeeds in putting the plethora of risks and vulnerabilities into perspective. Knowing which ones to worry about (and to worry less about) is critical to the proper ranking and handling of information security issues.<br />Among the issues addressed are viruses and worms, physical security, firewalls, cryptography, denial of service attacks, and privacy. The reader comes out of the detailed discussion of these issues with a broad understanding of the elements involved within information systems security.<br />In this case, one can judge a book by its cover. Readers looking for practical, hard-hitting answers about information security will find White-Hat Security Arsenal:Tackling the Threats an excellent resource to tackle.ooking for practical, hard-hitting answers about information security will find White-Hat Security Arsenal:Tackling the Threats an excellent resource to tackle.	2001-09-28

Although more money is being spent on information systems security, systems are increasingly complex, and complex systems are difficult to protect. This book is a good starting point for network managers and system administrators who need clear instruction on how to create and run a secure technology infrastructure.<br />As security of information systems increases in importance, it is becoming critical for everyone in the IT department to understand how all the components work. While not every staff member or manager needs to know how to install and configure firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and e-mail filters, they must nonetheless understand the significance of such technologies. This book covers those issues along with other significant information.<br />Besides security products, the book gets into the nitty-gritty of security architectures, hacking, encryption, and operating systems. It includes a set of blueprints that describe key systems for designing an effective security architecture. This review of mine originally appeared at ...<br />The book concludes with the question of whether UNIX or Windows NT is more secure, a topic that has been fodder for countless debates. Avoiding a discussion of the minutiae of each operating system, the author astutely notes that the answer to the question is not within the operating system itself but rather with the system administrator. That's good counsel from a good book.	2001-08-22

But, as Voltaire astutely noted, common sense is not so common.<br />The truth is that there is really nothing new in this book that CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team...) has not been saying in one way or another for the last decade.  But that should not in the least underscore the importance of the book, as it provides an excellent treatment of securing information assets.  In fact, the book subtly echoes the sentiment of George Santayana, who stated that \\"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\"  This is true with information security.  As even with all of the strides that have been made and new security technologies that have been developed, a large percentage of security breaches are the result of systems that were either incorrectly configured or ineffectively secured.<br />While many people erroneously think that a firewall is the foundation of information security, the truth is that an effective set of information security policies and procedures are. In fact, policy is such a critical element within the effective and successful operation of information technology systems, that systems can't be effective unless they are deployed in the context of working policies that govern their use and administration...<br />As an example, Marcus Ranum defines a firewall as \\"the implementation of your Internet security policy.  If you haven't got a security policy, you haven't got a firewall.  Instead, you've got a thing that's sort of doing something, but you don't know what it's trying to do because no one has told you what it should do.\\"  The sad fact is that most firewalls permit so much traffic through that it is often difficult to tell where the firewall ends and the router begins...<br />The truth be told, when Mother in her infinite wisdom says something, it is good advice.  When a consultant says the same thing, it is called a Best Practice.  Some of the best practices that CERT has long recommended are:  using effective passwords, ensuring systems are patched against recent vulnerabilities, hardening the operating system, removing unnecessary services, protocols, and accounts, and more.  None of these recommendations is exactly rocket science; even so, this aspect of Security 101 is overlooked in many, if not most, organizations...<br />The beauty of the book is that it is vendor agnostic.  It doesn't cover the specific details of the operating system or software application; rather, it focuses on the policies and procedures needed to make that system secure.  With that, the book will be current, even with operating systems' changes and upgrades.<br />Many computer books today have scores, if not hundreds, of pages of screen prints and source code, which often only serve to increase their page count. This book has none of that, and is instead a systematic and methodical method of how to secure networks.  The book is a good complement to Security Engineering by Ross Anderson.<br />While Security Engineering lays the foundation for the engineering aspect of information systems security, the CERT guide builds on that framework.  The book details the underpinning to securing information assets, namely: Hardening, Preparing, Detecting, Responding, and Improving.  Each chapter in the book builds on those pillars and does not leave a stone unturned when it comes to securing systems.  The beauty of the book is that even though it is completely vendor agnostic, its topics are germane to every network operating system.<br />If your mother were involved with information security, she would tell you to read this book.

With that, the book will be current, even with operating systems' changes and upgrades.  <br />Many computer books today have scores, if not hundreds, of pages of screen prints and source code, which often only serve to increase their page count. This book has none of that, and is instead a systematic and methodical method of how to secure networks.  The book is a good complement to Security Engineering by Ross Anderson. <br />While Security Engineering lays the foundation for the engineering aspect of information systems security, the CERT guide builds on that framework.  The book details the underpinning to securing information assets, namely: Hardening, Preparing, Detecting, Responding, and Improving.  Each chapter in the book builds on those pillars and does not leave a stone unturned when it comes to securing systems.  The beauty of the book is that even though it is completely vendor agnostic, its topics are germane to every network operating system.  <br />If your mother were involved with information security, she would tell you to read this book.

The book takes over to a large degree where his `The Puzzle Palace' left off.<br />The book details many of the inner workings of the NSA, but unfortunately, even after over 600 pages, the reader does not come away with a real understanding of what makes the NSA tick.  It would have been interesting if Bamford could have spent more time discussing the psychological makeup of what type of employee the NSA attracts.<br />Bamford does a really good job of discussing the workings of the SIGINT groups and how they are crucial to many intelligence operations.  The involvement of the NSA within corporate espionage (and how they protect US interests) has often been conjectured.  There are stories of the NSA calling IBM and telling them which IBM foreign offices are being bugged.  Bamford does not expand on those rumors.<br />Occasionally, Bamford comes across as someone with an axe to grind.  This is most apparent when he writes about the incident with the USS Liberty and the lifestyle issues of Bobby Ray Inman.  The style he uses in those chapters is histrionic, when compared to similar incidents in the book.<br />Bamford has a tirade about the attack on the Liberty, but glances over the fact that the Allies discovered evidence of Hitler's atrocities much earlier in WWII than the world was previously led to believe.<br />In short, `Body of Secrets' is the only book to date that has given outsiders a good inside look at the inner workings at Ft. Meade.  If you are able to separate his reporting from his occasional editorials, the book makes for a good read.	2001-07-26

All of the programmers instantly said no, save for a sole programmer who said he would definitely board the plane.  When asked why he was so confident about getting on the plane, he replied, \\"If Microsoft were to ever build an airplane, it would be extremely safe since the plane would never make it out of the gate.\\"<br />When it comes to information security, its current state is similar to that of a Microsoft airplane--built, but often flashy, while not forcefully functional.  The root of the problem is that most organizations view security as something added on in a piecemeal fashion, rather than an integral engineering issue.<br />Those in the construction business get this concept; they know that designs, plans, permits, coordination, commitment, buy-in, etc.,; are all requirements, not options.  Similarly, before any information security product is rolled-out, the appropriate project plans must exist.  While the concept that design must come before implementation is a given in most other industries, many IT departments lack this understanding.<br />Thus is the quandary that Ross Anderson deals with in Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems.  In a nutshell, Security Engineering is one of the best security books ever written.  If you are looking for 50 pages of screen prints on how to install and configure a printer under Windows 2000, this is the wrong book for that.  What Anderson does, in great detail and with lucidity, is particularize all of the aspects that are required to create a security infrastructure.  He relentlessly reiterates that security must be engineered into information systems from the outset.  When security is retrofitted into an application or system, it is never as effective.<br />Anderson defines security engineering as \\"building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error or mischance. As a discipline, it focuses on the tools, processes and methods needed to design, implement and test complete systems, and to adapt existing systems as their environment evolves.\\"<br />In its 24 chapters, the book covers every domain of computer security.  As noted security guru Bruce Schneier writes in the book's foreword  \\"If you're even thinking of doing any security engineering, you need to read this book.\\"  Schneier's comment compliments his own attitude that security is not a product, rather a process.  Going with that mantra, Anderson demonstrates in exhaustive detail how information security must be implemented in every aspect of the information system's infrastructure in order for systems to be dependable and secure.<br />The often knee-jerk response to information security is to deal with it at the product level.  With that, the security product of the year is purchased (Air Gap, IDS, PKI, etc.) and the company hopes and prays for security.  Unfortunately, it does not work like that.  Anderson writes that security products can't operate in a vacuum.  They must operate in the framework of a comprehensive architecture supported by policies.  That is precisely why there are huge amounts of books on security component technology, but very few on how to use them effectively.  When it comes to making all of these security technologies interoperate, there are few good titles in print, and that is the value of this book....<br />In more than 600 pages of intense information, Anderson lays the groundwork on how to build a secure and dependable system.  Every aspect of information security is discussed in the book -- from passwords, access control, and attacks, to physical security and policy.  Additionally, relevant and timely topics such as information warfare, privacy protection, access control, and more are discussed.  This is the only book that covers the end-to-end spectrum of security design and engineering.<br />Just as important as the technical issues covered in the book, the entire range of attacks that distributed systems can face (technical, procedural, and physical) are also covered.  Understanding these threats are paramount in order to properly secure the system.  Anderson notes from years of personal experience that many security systems are designed solely to keep the good guys out without thinking of the bad guys.  There are two mistakes with this approach -- it only solves a smart part of the problem, and more importantly, the bad guys do not follow the rules.  Bruce Schneier likens this approach to security as putting a pole in front of your house and hoping the attacker runs into the pole.  The reality is that the adversary will simply go around the pole.<br />While many of the chapter topics may sound unexciting, Anderson has a wonderful writing style and at times reads almost like a Tom Clancy thriller with its details of military command and control systems and other similar topics. Anyone responsible for information security should read Security Engineering.as the technical issues covered in the book, the entire range of attacks that distributed systems can face (technical, procedural, and physical) are also covered.

Knowing that, law enforcement goes to great lengths to ensure that evidence is appropriately collected and protected. That works well in the physical world, where law enforcement has many generations' worth of experience. But in the modern world of computers and digital networks, where the simple act of rebooting a computer is enough to wipe out large amounts of evidence, law enforcement clearly needs thorough guidance.<br />Such a resource is here: Digital Evidence and Computer Crime, an excellent book that details the elements of digital crime. Author Eoghan Casey does a superb job of applying forensic science to computers. The information presented here is critical to a diverse audience: law enforcement, attorneys, forensic scientists, and systems administrators, for instance.<br />While cybercrime law is in some ways similar to other aspects of criminal law, it nonetheless has its own language and categories. For instance, jurisdiction is a key element in both the physical and digital realms, but it is a much trickier concept in the latter. Casey develops this topic and many more.  Those new to computers and networks need not worry: the book begins with an explanation of how they function. With the basics out of the way, Casey details how computers can be used in crime and how the evidence created from these activities can be used for later analysis....The accompanying CD-ROM contains simulated cases that integrate many of the topics covered in the text. In all, the book and CD are an excellent introduction to an increasingly important area of law enforcement.	2001-06-28

Business management types (AKA suits) would conjecture that the book is simply a nefarious cookbook for those who want a quick and dirty introduction to hacking and systems penetration.  Engineers and experienced systems administrators would argue that the book is not deep enough for their needs. Both sides are right.<br />For the most part, Maximum Security is geared toward systems administrators who need to know how to secure their individual systems, but lack experience with information systems security.  Those who are learning about information systems security and want to get their hands wet with hacking tools and concepts will find Maximum Security a good starting point.  The book is an interesting read and has loads of information, including a plethora of links for further information.  Each chapter lists many tools (both black, gray, and white hat) and additional resources for deeper information.  But, those readers who want to understand how to design and engineer secure systems will likely find that the book does not meet their needs.<br />In Maximum Security, the author (Anonymous, with help from13 contributors) discusses an overview of systems security, and then describes the line of attack a hacker would use to penetrate a system.  The downside to having so many contributors is that, with so many different authors, there is not a consistent style and methodology.  (A similar title, Hacking Exposed has only three authors and a more methodical and systematic style).  This lack of consistency between chapters is not a major concern when looking at individual systems, but when attempting to secure an enterprise with a single methodology, such an approach is often problematic.<br />The first three parts of the book provide a generic introduction to information systems security and the various threats and vulnerabilities associated with it.  Parts four and five get into the nitty gritty of how attacks are carried out.  The authors detail vulnerabilities and shortcomings of different types of systems, from firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to network operating systems (Solaris, Windows NT/2000, NetWare) and routers.<br />Chapter 20 provides a good introduction to the various issues with Unix security.  While a lot of different topics are discussed (file system security, network services, host lockdown, and more), none of them are discussed in comprehensive detail.<br />Nicholas Raba, the author of Chapter 23 on Macintosh does a great job of destroying the myth of the presumed security invincibility of the Macintosh platform.  Many people have the false assumption that the Macintosh is somehow more secure than Windows NT and Solaris.  Raba astutely notes that for every hack that exists for the PC, there is an equivalent hack for the Mac.<br />CD-ROMs that accompany books are often of dubious value and only increase the cost of the book.  However, the CD-ROM that comes with Maximum Security provides links, tools, and resources discussed in the book that are organized by chapter.  It also contains over 25 different hacking and security tools.<br />One shortcoming of Maximum Security is that, although it provides hundreds of references and URLs, the reader does not come away with a clear understanding of the underlying techniques and methods necessary for the design and rollout of secure systems.

This combined with his near deification of the media make those sections of republic.com pure rubbish.  Sunstein fears that by having such filters, this limits the amount of shared experiences that people are afforded<br />Sunstein does raise some good points when he questions the nature of how the Internet can exacerbate the `consumption treadmill' in which people buy more and better goods not because they make us happier or better off, but because they help us keep up with others.<br />Sunstein has an irrational fear that when people limit what information they want to view, the social bonds of society are weakened.  While that point is debatable, it has utterly nothing to do with the Internet.  How an individual filters their content has been occurring for a long time, the only difference with the Internet is that the medium has changed.<br />After reading the book, the reader sees that Sunstein is obviously a brilliant legal scholar.  But his myriad assumptions and hypothesis's in the book show how he needs to get out of the often-theoretical world of academia and have a few shared experiences with the common man.	2001-06-04

For diet, there are well over 15,000 titles.  For PKI (public key infrastructure), there are exactly four.<br />While there are nearly 4,000 times as many books about dieting as there are books about PKI, the similarities between the two subjects are interesting.  Both dieting and PKI are often difficult to do right, but when they are done correctly, the positive effects are immense.<br />In a nutshell, a PKI is a set of technologies that enables users of inherently insecure networks and software applications (i.e., the Internet and browsers) to exchange data and perform transactions securely and privately.  In a PKI, each user has a set of cryptographic keys comprised of a public-key and a private-key.  A PKI also enables the use of a digital certificate that can be used to identify items such as individual end users, host systems, organizations, and directory services.  PKI is based on public key cryptography, which is the most common method used to authenticate the sender of a message, or to encrypt that message.<br />A PKI establishes digital trust and maintains that level of assurance.  In the real world, trust is built through a complex web of social, legal, national, international, and business interactions that may take years or decades to develop. Unfortunately, that same level of trust is much harder to implement in the electronic world.<br />With that in mind, Planning for PKI: Best Practices Guide for Deploying Public Key Infrastructure provides a thorough technical introduction to the workings of PKI.  Those wanting a less technical and more managerial approach should read  PKI: Implementing &amp; Managing E-Security by Andrew Nash.<br />The reason that PKI is so important is that information security is often the most fundamental need for today's businesses and e-commerce sites.  There is hardly a Fortune 500 company without some type of external public connection, and given that more than 95% of the hosts on the Internet are running TCP/IP version 4 (with no inherent security), these systems are built and running on an insecure infrastructure.  Such a reality is a scary thought.<br />The book is well organized into six sections.  The first three chapters cover the basics and rudiments of security, cryptography, and PKI.  Fortunately, the authors accomplish this by page 43.  One of my personal gripes against many information security books is that they spend way too much time rehashing security basics, while not getting to the subject title until halfway through the book.<br />Section Two includes seven chapters detailing the different PKI components, protocols, architectures, and uses of digital certificates.  Many of those considering PKI do not always realize that the &quot;I&quot; in PKI is infrastructure.  Without a well-thought out and tested architecture and methodology, a PKI is nearly sure to fail.  Getting the initial PKI software rolled out is often not an easy endeavor.  Getting those pieces to work effectively in a distributed infrastructure takes an immense amount of planning and work.  Section Two details ways to ensure that a PKI is well built, so that it does not collapse like a poorly designed building.<br />Chapter 12, &quot;Policies, Procedures and PKI,&quot; is one of the most important chapters in the book, in that a PKI comprises much more than simply its underlying software.  The book astutely notes that the technical mechanisms of a PKI are insufficient on their own, as they must be used in combination with a set of procedures to implement a particular corporate security policy.<br />The need for policy can't be over-emphasized, as it is a critical element in the effective and successful operation of a PKI.  A PKI can't be effective unless it is deployed in the context of working policies that govern the use, administration, and management of certificates.  In a similar vein, noted security guru Marcus Ranum defines a firewall as &quot;the implementation of your Internet security policy.  If you haven't got a security policy, you haven't got a firewall.  Instead, you've got a thing that's sort of doing something, but you don't know what it's trying to do because no one has told you what it should do&quot;.  So, too, with a PKI; if there are no policies to determine its appropriate use, inertia states that it will not be used properly.<br />Rather than being an abstract and dry guide, Planning for PKI: Best Practices Guide for Deploying Public Key Infrastructure concludes with some real-world examples of PKI rollouts.  By learning how the three large PKI projects were implemented, readers can benefit from the lessons learned, so that they will not make the same (often common) mistakes.<br />Rather than being an abstract academic text, the authors, Russ Housley and Tim Polk, write from years of practical experience.

Similarly, information security has changed dramatically in the same time period, when the authors of this book were writing the first edition, but its essence has remained the same.<br />Topics such as ActiveX, RealVideo, IP version 6, and instant messaging were not even on the horizon when the first edition of this book was released. Now in its overdue second edition, the book covers these important topics and more.<br />Among the many fine security books available-several of which have been reviewed in this column-Building Internet Firewalls is one of the best. It is not just a comprehensive tome on firewalls; the authors take the many aspects of a firewall (for example, policies, protocols, and varied networks) and integrate them into a common framework. This is necessary, since management often equates security with firewalls.<br />Divided into four sections (network security, building firewalls, Internet services, and site security), the bulk of the book is built around the sections on Internet services and building firewalls. In these 20 chapters, the authors detail the many aspects of a firewall. Critical concepts such as firewall technologies, architectures, intermediary protocols, and directory services are discussed in detail. The authors do a splendid job of defining the various types of firewalls and exploring their advantages and weaknesses.<br />This book is remarkable for detailing the components of an effective information security system that are conferred via a firewall.

Fortunately, books such as Cryptography Decrypted: A Pictorial Introduction to Digital Security provide a good, largely jargon-free introduction to an often arcane subject.<br />Cryptography is one of the central components of information security. Without it, much that we take for granted, such as e-commerce and confidential e-mail, would be impossible. Cryptography has four main components: confidentiality (information can't be understood by anyone for whom it is not intended); integrity (information can't be altered in storage or transit without the alteration being detected); nonrepudiation (the sender can't later deny having created or sent a message); and authentication (the sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin and destination of the information). Each of these basics is discussed.<br />The meat of the book is divided into four parts: secret key cryptography, public key cryptography, key distribution, and real-world systems. Numerous illustrations clarify difficult concepts, such as hash functions.<br />This is one of the better introductions to contemporary cryptography, covering all the major topics in a user-friendly manner. While no mathematical background is required, readers will be surprised by how many mathematical concepts will become familiar by the end of the book.<br />While no novella, Cryptography Decrypted still captures the reader's attention.

US	48840057	R2IEEH4FM1NU8	0596000111	636357694	SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide	Books	5	50	54	N	N	The SSH book	There is a good reason why people write superficial messages on post cards: post cards afford no confidentiality and there is no expectation of privacy. The Internet can be compared to a post card; it is one large system where data is freely interchanged.  While common sense tells us that post cards are open to the public, there is a misperception among non-technical Internet users that Internet data is kept private. However, nothing could be further from the truth; on the Wild West net,<br />all data is inherently open and unregulated.<br />There are solutions to this predicament. One solution is called SSH (Secure Shell).  SSH provides a way to take that &quot;postcard&quot; and have it securely delivered by a courier.<br />In a nutshell, the book SSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide expands on two basic ideas: -  Privacy is a basic human right, but on today's computer networks, privacy isn't guaranteed.  - SSH is a simple idea, but it has many complex parts.<br />But the truth is that the need for privacy and security on today's networks is far too important to be encapsulated in two bullets.  This book is so loaded with valuable and important information that anyone using or administering SSH should read it thoroughly.<br />As an introduction, SSH is a protocol that enables secure communications between computer systems that are communicating over insecure channels.  SSH is more than simply a point-to-point encryption process such as a VPN. SSH allows users to authenticate themselves to remote hosts.  After authentication, users can securely execute commands on a remote machine. SSH fills in for the security deficiencies that are inherent in applications such as telnet, ftp, rlogin, rsh, and rcp.  The book also shows how SSH can be used to secure other protocols, such as POP, SMTP, IMAP, and others.<br />SSH was developed in response to the Unix &quot;r&quot; commands' (rsh, rlogin, rcp) vulnerability to attack.  Some of these vulnerabilities include password and protocol sniffing, spoofing, eavesdropping and connection hijacking.<br />SSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide is everything you need to know about SSH and lives up to its bold claim of being a definitive guide.  After an introduction to SSH -- why it came to be needed and its features and history -- the book goes into the core of the administration and use of SSH.  The authors explain that SSH is in reality, not a true shell. The two versions of secure shell are SSH1 and SSH2; the book distinguishes between the two and describes when to use each version.<br />Chapter 2 details the basic client use of SSH.  It shows how remote sessions are managed by the program and the various ways a user can authenticate to an SSH server.<br />Subsequent chapters cover the aspects of installing and compiling SSH.  A myriad of different configuration possibilities are discussed.  As the authors maintain, SSH is at its foundation a simple idea, but it has countless complex parts.  SSH allows for a highly configurable architecture and provides both strong encryption and public-key authentication, but this comes at the price of complexity.  The book allows an SSH administrator to understand the various versions and implementations of SSH (SSH1, SSH2, OpenSSH, F-Secure SSH, in addition to ports for Unix, Windows and Macintosh).<br />Chapter 9 provides in-depth coverage of a powerful feature of SSH -- port forwarding and X forwarding.  Forwarding enables SSH to intercept service requests from another software program on one side of the SSH connection, send it across the encrypted connection, and then deliver it to the intended recipient on the other side.  X Forwarding enables a user to securely run remote X Window applications by securing the X protocol traffic.<br />The authors demonstrate their extensive real-world experience with SSH throughout the book. The book includes many technical tips that could only have been obtained through extensive and widespread use.  This attention to detail is especially useful considering the documentation provided with the free SSH implementation is often inaccessible for those without extensive SSH experience. Chapter 11 -- Case Studies, available on-line at Unix Review's book excerpt's -- details examples of real-world use of SSH.  Two examples are how to integrate SSH with Pine or IMAP and the use of Kerberos with SSH.  Anyone attempting such installations and configurations can attest to the difficulties involved.<br />For anyone who has had occasion to troubleshoot SSH, Chapter 12 -- Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions -- will be a real boon.  Many of the common (and some not so common) issues that have left many  SSH systems administrators scratching their heads are addressed in this chapter.<br />For the SSH aficionado on a tight budget, the comprehensive SSH FAQ can be downloaded from various sites on the Web.  For everyone else who needs to understand the often-undocumented inner-workings of SSH, this book is required reading.e.

Here, again, the great Chinese military leader is invoked, this time to draw parallels between his thinking and strategies for information warfare. The comparison, while sometimes trite in other works, is appropriate in this case; there truly is a digital war raging in the information systems trenches, and only until one accepts that premise can successful information security be achieved.<br />The first part of the book covers the fundamentals of the Chinese &quot;knowledge warrior philosophy&quot; and details the many facets of corporate information systems that must be secured. Topics such as &quot;targets and vulnerabilities,&quot; &quot;preparing for the siege,&quot; and &quot;planning and force&quot; are all applied to the digital world.<br />The book also details the varied techniques of the information warrior and can be summed up by a quote from the Navy SEALs program that opens chapter nine: &quot;The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat.&quot; Useful exercises enable the reader to focus on the different tasks involved in information protection.<br />This is one of the most original security books to be published in recent years. Its style is of significance to information systems managers who need to understand how to effectively secure their systems. At less than 175 pages, the book has more value than works triple its size.<br />...	2001-03-22

In that case, intrusion detection systems become an important component of a company's computer and network security package.<br />Simply put, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is a type of network security management system that gathers and analyzes information to identify possible security breaches, which include both intrusions (attacks from outside the organization) and misuse (attacks from within the organization). IDSs, which were developed in response to an increasing number of attacks on such major sites as the White House and Microsoft, use vulnerability assessment and scanning technologies to determine the security of a network.<br />Rebecca Bace's book is an excellent introduction to IDSs. Many people who buy such systems become distressed that one can't just buy an off-the-shelf IDS and turn it on. Effective use of an IDS requires significant planning and design, which Bace's book conveys.<br />Bace's book also offers a good history of IDSs and explains the lifecycle of an IDS installation, from the initial requirements to deployment and configuration. Bace further details how to respond to specific types of intrusions and how to tie all of this back to an effective security infrastructure. Bace's book is a good choice for anyone considering use of an IDS or who wants to make sense of an existing IDS.<br />...	2001-03-01

That is a real shame and is indicative of corporate America's apathy towards information systems security. The fact that this book is ranked 59,827 in Amazon sales is indeed good for security companies.<br />Donn Parker takes his experience and viewpoints about information systems security and organizes it into a readable work.<br />Parker takes information security and rewrites it to his weltanschauung.  While most references list the `Big 3' tenets of security as: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability; Parker breaks this info new domains of: Availability, Authenticity, Confidentiality, Integrity, Utility and Possession.<br />The book indeed does present a new framework for protecting information.  Despite the fact that more and more is being spent on information systems security, things are getting more and more complex, and complex systems are much harder to protect.	2001-02-21

Many are fat tomes, exhaustively written with myriad details. But corporate networks remain extremely insecure. Is anyone buying or reading these books?<br />With its mantra that security is a process, not a product, Secrets and Lies is one of the most important security books to come out in the last ten years. It forces information security managers to focus on security at the macro level--the processes--rather than at the micro level, as in the installation of a firewall or intrusion detection system. And since so many managers do equate security with firewalls, it is easy to understand why corporate networks are at risk.<br />Anyone looking for a quick fix to their security problems will not find it here. As each day passes, more and more security vulnerabilities, network breaches, and digital disasters are occurring. Without processes in place to manage these incidents, all of the security products in the world will be for naught.<br />Readers looking for a matter-of-fact, no-nonsense initiation into the world of information systems security should consider Secrets and Lies required reading.	2001-01-30

While most people know why these incidents occurred, Hacking Exposed explains how they occurred and, more important, how to prevent them from occurring.<br />The cover of Hacking Exposed announces that &quot;Network security is Y2K without the deadline.&quot; That alarmist statement, however, is the only hype in the book. The work is packed with real-world examples and links to tools needed to assess the security of any type of client/server and Web system. As they detail the myriad vulnerabilities in different types of systems, the authors provide countermeasures for each of them.<br />Well organized, the book progresses in an orderly fashion. It methodically goes through the process of exploiting a target to penetrate a system--from identification and enumeration to actual penetration. The authors provide detailed instructions and explanations for many security features and flaws in Unix, Linux, Windows, NetWare, routers, firewalls, and more.  Topics covered include state-of-the-art computer and network penetration, as viewed by both the attacker and the defender; remote system identification; vulnerability identification; war dialers; firewall circumvention; and denial-of-service attacks. An appendix explores the security characteristics of Windows  2000.<br />Some may argue that books such as this one only serve to motivate and educate hackers. The truth is that hackers are already aware of the book's contents. This book is designed for system administrators and managers who need to know their systems' risks and vulnerabilities and how to address them. When they are done with this book, system administrators and managers will be familiar with such critical topics as back channels, port redirection, banner grabbing, and buffer overflows. Hacking Exposed is a must-read for anyone who wants to know what is really happening on their network.....	2000-12-21

In a nutshell, Godel's Undecidability Theorem proved that within a formal system, there are questions that exist which are neither provable nor disprovable on the basis of the axioms that define the system.  He also showed that in formal system, a decidability of all questions is required.  Given that, there will be contradictory and unfinished statements. This makes up his Incompleteness Theorem.<br />With these two theorems, Godel showed that there are problems that simply can't be solved by any set of rules or procedures.<br />This disproved a common belief at the time (primarily via  Whitehead &amp; Russell in Principia Mathematica) that mathematics could be completely integrated into a single foundation of logic.<br />For those that had attempted to make a deity out of logic and mathematics, Godel simply nailed their coffin closed.  Mathematics indeed has its limits.<br />While I found the underlying logic and proofs often perplexing, the importance of the book can't be overemphasized.	2000-12-12

Readers will be able to get a handle on the CBK (Common Body of Knowledge), on which the CISSP exam is based.  Nonetheless, the breadth of the CBK means that the Handbook can't be simply read over a long weekend.  It takes a lot of time to assimilate the myriad information.<br />Given that there is no comprehensive study guide for the exam, anyone planning on sitting for the CISSP exam will find himself or herself referring to the Handbook fairly often.<br />The only downside to the book is that since there are so many authors involved with the content of the book, there is a lack of consistent verbiage in it.<br />But even for those that don't plan on sitting for the CISSP exam, they will find that the Handbook is a great security reference.	2000-11-28

It also is one of the finest computer security books ever written.  Bruce Schneier is a cryptologist who has a passion for cryptography, and it shows in his masterpiece.  Instant classic is an often used oxymoron, yet that term is most appropriate to describe Applied Cryptography.  If you have any interest with security and encryption, Applied Cryptography is clearly the definitive publication to reference and the most comprehensive text available about security and encryption.  It might sound as if via my high praise for this book that I am getting some type of endorsement, that is not the case.  It is just that Applied Cryptography is quite simply the most comprehensive, up-to-date work about cryptography.<br />The vast array of topics covered by the book is truly astounding in is depth and breadth.  There is hardly a single cryptological concept, either minor or major, that the book does not cover.  It is not possible to detail everything Applied Cryptography covers.  But a few of the topics are: Foundations of cryptography,  Protocols, Protocol Building Blocks, Key Lengths, key exchange, key  management, Algorithms, the mathematical of cryptography, DES, RSA, One-Way Hash Functions, Symmetric  vs. Public-Key cryptography, Public-Key Digital Signature Algorithms, Substitution Ciphers and Transposition Ciphers, Digital Signatures, Random and Pseudo-Random Sequence Generation, PGP, Authentication, Advanced security Protocols, Cryptographic Techniques, Identification Schemes, the politics of cryptography and much (much!) more.<br />Applied Cryptography also includes the source code for DES, IDEA, BLOWFISH, RC5 and other algorithms. It even covers encryption algorithms from the former Soviet Union, including GOST.<br />The magnificence of Applied Cryptography is that Schneier is able to take very complex, abstract ideas and express them in an extremely comprehensible manner. Applied Cryptography therefore lacks the dryness that plagues a lot of textbooks.  Schneier is able to take both theoretical and academic ideas, and mold them into practical real-world intelligible book.  All in all, Applied Cryptography makes for some very enjoyable and occasionally humorous  reading.<br />One thing I really liked about Applied Cryptography is its index.  Rather than using the traditional cumbersome citations such as RIV92b or GOL88 that often take a while to locate, Schneier simply uses numbers.  In light that he references over 1600 sources, it makes looking up the sources an incredible time saver.  What is extremely impressive about Applied Cryptography is that Schneier quotes from every imaginable source.  From general security periodicals, scholarly academic journals, conference proceedings, government publications and official standards, Schneier has been there.<br />Schneier writes at length about whether a crypto customer should choose an algorithm for that is publicly published algorithm (i.e., DES, RSA, Blowfish) or to use a proprietary algorithm that belongs to a specific manufacturer.  With a proprietary algorithm, Schneier writes that it is impossible to determine how truly secure the algorithm is, given that the owners do not generally make their code available for open inspection.  There is even the possibility that the manufacturer (or government, if under federal contract) has put in a back door into the algorithm.  Schneier states that:  &quot;Putting your trust in a single manufacturer, consultant, or government is asking for trouble.  The NSA has some of the world's best cryptographers working for it, but it is hard to know if they're telling you all you know.&quot;<br />This idea then segues into the (in)famous Clipper chip and concept of key escrow.  As a world class cryptographer, Schneier has major issues with the concept of Clipper, calling it &quot;Orwellian&quot;  Schneier feels that encryption is too importantto be left to the government and Clipper advances the power of the government over the right of the people.<br />In conclusion, Applied Cryptography is a must have book for anyone involved with encryption and security.rtant to be left to the government and Clipper advances the power of the government over the right of the people.<br />In conclusion, Applied Cryptography is a must have book for anyone involved with encryption and security.	2000-11-27

An editor at a major publishing company of computer books (who obviously requested anonymity) told me that to dominate the shelf space, many publishers produce large, fat computer books. I wrote how such books often have an extremely low knowledge-to-page ratio.  The low knowledge-to-page ratio is used to detail how much actual learning is gleaned per page.  When books are crammed with useless graphs, screen shots and illustrations, the knowledge-to-page ratio declines.<br />Luckily, O'Reilly &amp; Associates ... do not follow such a creed.  The reason O'Reilly books due not suffer from a low knowledge-to-page ratio is that they  reason that their readers are smart, well-informed &amp; experienced.  Given such an assumption, O'Reilly does not need to pad their books with useless and redundant information.  O'Reilly sees themselves as solutions providers to their readers, attempting to produce solid, decisive books.  That is their intent, and they have succeeded marvelously.<br />Essential Windows NT System Administration is written not just to be a guide to Window NT, but rather to assist an NT administrator to work smarter and more productively.  Frisch writes that her goal with this book is to assist system administrators in managing Windows NT systems as productively as possible, while making the task as pleasant and satisfying as can be.  Giving the sometimes difficult nature of Windows NT, this is a lofty goal.  The book covers the workstation and server versions of Windows NT 4 on both Intel and Alpha processor-based systems.<br />The books covers the following key areas of NT system administration:<br />· How Windows NT systems boot and how to shut them down  · User account administration, including tips for managing large numbers of accounts  · Creating file systems, including striped and fault-tolerant file systems, and securing their contents from unauthorized access  · Sharing file systems via the network, using Windows NT's native share facility and other facilities such as Samba and NFS  · General and advanced network configuration, including DHCP, DNS, WINS, routing, and RAS  · Managing printers, including local printers, network printers, and printer pools  · Managing processes, including the Windows NT schedule service, as well as performance optimization and capacity planning  · Securing Windows NT systems, including implementing security policies and system auditing · Automating system administration tasks with scripts<br />The book opens with a brief overview of the responsibilities a system administrator and the NT tools available to help them do the job.  Like most books, the first chapter is about the operating system architecture &amp; design, administrative tools and wizards, NT trivia and legends, registry and the NT file system.<br />Chapter 3 provides a good synopsis of user account management, which is a frequent task for most system administrators.  Standard NT users accounts and groups and how to modify them via User Manager is discussed in detail.  Frisch spends a few pages discussing the bane of securing an NT network, that of passwords and password management.  Penetration tools such as L0phtCrack ... can be used to recover passwords from a Windows NT server.  Since NT Server doesn't store the actual passwords on an NT Domain Controller or Workstation, rather it stores a cryptographic hash of the passwords, L0phtCrack can take the hashes of passwords and generate the cleartext passwords from them.  L0phtCrack can use both a dictionary attack and a brute force attack.  The only negative thing I can say about the book is that it does not list any value-added vendors of NT tools and utilities.<br />Chapter 4 explains a topic that is elementary to Unix system administrators, but often enigmatic to their NT counterparts, that of processes &amp; process management.  From a technical point of view, processes are NT system objects that have a virtual address space, a chunk of executable code, system resources and one or more threads associated with it.  By understanding processes and the underlying technology surround them, one can gain a tremendous grasp on how the internals of NT operate.  With such information, management of NT systems becomes much simpler.<br />All of the chapters follow a consistent flow of providing thorough and clear instruction.  After completing a chapter, one really gains a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand.  As an example, Chapter 10 takes in just under 50 pages is able to outline the NT security subsystem.  Frisch provides a good overview of NT Domains and the trust relationships that go along with them.

It attempts to help you solve the $64,000 questions of the 90's: Should your company switch to Windows NT?<br />Non-technical staff will appreciate the book for its readable, jargon free (well, almost.  Any jargon used is clearly explained) style.  Technical staff will appreciate the book for its insights into the business case for NT that they likely have not seen.<br />While NT is definitely the hot and politically correct NOS today, (one could almost say that in 1998, no one would get fired for choosing NT), choosing NT for the right reasons is not always such an easy endeavor.  While some information systems managers may simply dismiss NT as Microsoft's third attempt at the NOS market, the keen IS manager will know that NT is here to stay, and will use this book to justify or invalidate the use of NT within his company.<br />While systems administrators may appreciate NT from its ease of use and pretty GUI, the business case of how a business can benefit from NT is often an overlooked issue.<br />Looking Into Windows NT examines such business questions such as:<br />· What are the experiences of other companies using NT? · What effect will NT have on your current applications? · Which applications will run best on NT? · Which applications won't run on NT? · Can NT really add value to your business? · What are NT's most popular features · How does Microsoft itself use NT? · How does one add NT to a Novell NetWare environment?  What about Unix?<br />The book opens with the statement &quot;Microsoft's products are pretty good, but their marketing and sales organization is even better&quot;.  The difficulty that the business manager faces when evaluating NT is the task of breaking through Microsoft's marketing to see if the product at hands truly meets the companies needs.  What this book gives the non-technical manager is the ability to see through the often hype involved with marketing and see if NT can truly support his business.<br />The book uses a real, major corporation (using a fictitious name though) as its case study.  The chapters detail the companies network infrastructure, protocols used, remote needs and directory services requirements in place, and attempts to see if NT can help this company.<br />One important question that the company posed, and one that is crucial to most organizations is, what is the effect of NT on our current applications?  While NT runs &amp; is compatible with most 16-bit applications, there are large amounts that simply won't run under NT.  This is an issue for companies that have a large amount of in-house written applications.<br />The book goes into depth about the domain architecture of Windows NT.  It discussed the various domain models and servers &amp; which specific model scales best to different type of companies.  The book attempts to determine which is the best model for different types of companies; from large multi-national companies, to small single-office entities.  What is interesting about the book is that it also specifies the particulars of how the Microsoft's internal domain is structured.  By getting a view of how Microsoft names their domains and what type of arrangement they use, one can get a qualified description of large-scale NT operation.<br />NT offers a major new feature set.  The book goes into detail about how innovations such as: the NT file system, distributed file systems, fault tolerance, RAID, hardware scalability can and will effect anorganization.<br />The NetWare arena is where NT has made a significant amount if inroads, much to the chagrin of Novell.  Even if a company decides to eliminate NetWare for NT, this shift must occur without a significant downtime to existing system.  The book details the varied tools, methods and utilities that NT employs  to make a NetWare to NTR migration successful.<br />The book comes in at 155 pages and can be read in a few hours.  This book does not attempt to answer every question about NT, nor can it, but covers all of the rudiments. Can one book really provide you with all the answer to the question &quot;Should we switch to NT&quot;?  No. Today's information systems are too large and complex for an off-the-shelf book to answer the question definitively.  But if you are empowered to decided whether to switch to NT or stay with Banyan Vines, or need to see if the NT file system can support your business needs, get this book, then call Microsoft.

This book does not attempt to answer every question about NT, nor can it, but covers all of the rudiments. Can one book really provide you with all the answer to the question &quot;Should we switch to NT&quot;?  No. Today's information systems are too large and complex for an off-the-shelf book to answer the question definitively.  But if you are empowered to decided whether to switch to NT or stay with Banyan Vines, or need to see if the NT file system can support your business needs, get this book, then call Microsoft.  Not the other way around.	2000-10-30

In some ways, the Windows NT operating system is also a beast.  While hidden under a attractive graphical user interface, NT is a complex set of interconnected systems, attempting to function as a symphony.  What WindowsNT 4 Server Unleashed accomplishes it that it helps take away the general complexities of NT 4.  If you enjoy network and NT, you will find these book to be both enjoyable and educational reading.<br />Getting a handle on NT requires knowledge in 4 general areas:<br />· NT architecture · Planning, Installation &amp; Configuration · Administration &amp; Management · Troubleshooting<br />In addition to these four areas, Windows NT Server 4 Unleashed takes you beyond the basics, and focuses on the particular strengths and formidable tasks of administering a Windows NT 4 server based network.  It also shows how to manage both single and multiple domains, tips on improving system security and data integrity, and ways to optimize network performance. In addition, it goes into detail on the manner in which to successfully integrate Windows NT with other networks, such as NetWare, LAN Manager and Unix.<br />The book contains five parts.  Part One of the book details the fundamentals of Windows NT.  Many users mistakenly jump right into an NT installation without knowing the key fundamental concepts and components of NT.  Knowing these fundamentals is critical for the long term success of a system.<br />As an example, the books states the importance of the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).  Yet as Microsoft Technical Support has stated numerous times, many problems occur due to people installing hardware that is not on the HCL.  Had they known the consequence of using non-compatible hardware, the support issue would have never transpired.<br />Part Two goes into the aspects of a complete NT Server installation and configuration.  Topics included are:<br />· File system selection · Disk partitions &amp; volumes · Networking and protocols · DHCP, WINS, DNS,  · TCP/IP configuration · RAS · Principles of Browsing · Working with clients (MS-DOS, Windows, Unix, Macintosh<br />Completion of Part Two takes you to the half-way point of the book.  At this juncture, you should have a pretty solid understanding of Windows NT Server and be able to perform a complete installation of a NT server and its peripheral software components.<br />Part Three goes into the actual management and administering of a network.  Important concepts such as: user, group and remote administration. The registry, security and RAS are covered.  This section is crucial due to the fact that the success or failure of a working and effective production network can be established here.<br />One of the key benefits of using NT Server is its Remote Access Services (RAS).  RAS is included free with NT.  RAS allows one to create a network connection to NT over a modem line.  RAS allows an NT Server to have up to 256 simultaneous incoming modem connections.  RAS allows NT to serve as an enterprise-level communications server.  A new feature of RAS in Windows 4 is that it includes Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).  PPTP allows you to take that same RAS connection and make it into a virtual private network.  VPN offer a much greater amount of security  Many organizations are moving to the NT platform on the influence of RAS alone.<br />Part Four of the book details crucial, but often neglected topics such as security and auditing.  Many network administrators are so overwhelmed just putting out fires that they do not have the time or resources available to ensure that the security of a network is at a level where it should be.  One of the key components of the NT architecture is its security model.  Security is integrated into every component of NT.<br />Security can not be overlooked both from a practical standpoint and also from a legal standpoint.  Now that NT is finding its way into production environments on hospitals wards, legal offices and other areas where confidentiality is critical, failure to properly secure a server and network could put an organization at risk for not performing due diligence.  A little proactive security work can avoid litigation at a later date.<br />Part Five concludes the book with information about using NT as an applications server for Microsoft BackOffice and other Microsoft products, in addition on detailing how to use NT as an Internet and database server.  Anyone whose environment includes SQL or Oracle should read this section in great detail.<br />NT also operates particularly well as an Internet server.  One can easily place all of their Web, ftp, Newsgroup, and Telnet service onto a NT server.  NT operates gracefully as a complete Internet gateway.<br />The book also includes a CD-ROM.  The CD-ROM has an assortment of specialized NT specific 3rd-party tools.  Applications included on the CD-ROM encompass items such as: web servers, disk and network utilities, excellent security utilities from SomarSoft, Inc., HTML tools and the source code and examples from the book.  Some of the applications are out of date, but they can easily be updated from the vendors web site.<br />NT is a wild beast.  But taming that beast is not so difficult as long as you have direction and control.  WindowsNT 4 Server Unleashed allows you to tame the beast and take control of your NT network.

For whatever else 2000 might be the year of, many technology periodicals have proclaimed it the year of public key infrastructure, or PKI. Didn't know that? Many people don't even understand the term, which is neither descriptive nor intuitive.<br />In the physical world, trust is built through a complex web of social, legal, national, international, and business transactions that can take years or decades to develop. Items such as driver's licenses or passports create trust, because they are underwritten by the issuing authority. Unfortunately, the same level of trust is much harder to implement in the electronic world. One way to do so is via PKI.<br />As an example, one can use a passport for identification in the physical world. The cyberspace equivalent could be a digital certificate for authentication. Similarly, ink-based signatures are used on binding contracts. In the digital world, digital signatures are used to ensure a concept called nonrepudiation, by which the party involved in a process cannot later deny that he or she took part in it.<br />Understanding Public-Key Infrastructure is a guide to the effective deployment of PKI. The authors do a great job of covering the critical areas of PKI, including certification, operational considerations, standardization efforts, and deployment issues.<br />The authors deserve credit for producing a guide that avoids getting bogged down in minutiae and other technical details. Their approach is to cover a topic at a broad level, delve into some detail, then refer the reader to an appropriate source for particulars. They are also obsessively vendor-neutral.<br />This is an important book for those who expect to do e-commerce. Because whether anyone realizes it or not, this is the year of the PKI.<br />This review of mine originally appears at [...]	2000-10-30

In a similar sense, many people are unaware of a  skirmish currently being fought on the digital battlefield: the war for  protection of personal privacy.<br />  The authors of this book assert that privacy is one of the underpinnings of a  democratic society, and that if the democratic society in the United States  is to survive, Americans must maintain privacy in communications. In  addition, the means of protecting that privacy must be built into all current and future  communication systems.<br />  In recent years, the convergence of the Internet, telecommunications, and other  technologies has elevated personal privacy to new levels of importance. It is now possible  to effortlessly track a person's every movement, from the path of the morning commute to  the choice of sandwich at lunch. Every keystroke and e-mail transmission can likewise be  monitored.<br />  Authors Whitfield Diffie and Susan Landau assert that in the &quot;old days,&quot; when  communications largely occurred face to face, privacy was simply a matter of stepping  aside from those who butted in. With voice communications traveling over cellular  networks, through the Internet, and via other pathways prone to compromise, the best  method of securing such communications is with strong encryption.<br />  The authors argue their case effectively and engagingly, and are uniquely qualified to do  so, especially in the case of Diffie. He is one of the seminal computer scientists of the last  30 years, and hardly a household doesn't benefit from security technology he helped  develop. While he has written scholarly tomes and dissertations on encryption, Diffie does  an excellent job here of explaining in plain English how such technologies operate and why  they are crucial to a free society.<br />  The book details numerous privacy issues, from personal privacy to national security. It  starts with a brief overview of cryptography, just enough to educate the reader without  boring the nonmathematician. The rest of the book explores issues related to today's  communications systems, such as wiretapping. A welcome surprise is that the book often  reads like a Tom Clancy novel, interwoven as it is with episodes of domestic and  international intrigue.<br />  Privacy on the Line is a timely and important book, relevant to every citizen, wired or not.  Security professionals will find this work well worth their time.<br />This review of mine originally appeared at [...]e last              30 years, and hardly a household doesn't benefit from security technology he helped              develop.

Siyan<br />Numerous publishers of computer books are under the delusion that their books must be big and heavy to be of value.  Walk into any bookstore, and you will find that many computer books are well over 1,000 pages long and a few inches thick.  If you ride a bus or subway to work and do not have a seat, attempting to both read and hold such a tome is not an easy activity and may be prohibited by your chiropractor.<br />I spoke about his fat book phenomenon to an editor at a major publishing company of computer books (who obviously requested anonymity).  He disclosed to me that one reality that computer publishers have to live through is the explosion of the space dedicated to the computer section within bookstores.  Major bookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble have entire rooms or walls dedicated exclusively to computer books.  In order to dominate the shelf space, a common tactic in use by many publishers is to produce large, fat computer books.  When an average reader goes into a Barnes &amp; Noble and sees this great wall of computer books from Corpulent Publishing, Inc., the publisher hopes that he will equate quantity of pages with quality of titles from Corpulent Publishing.  What the reader does not always realize is that there is no correlation between quantity and quality.<br />Both Windows NT Server 4: Professional Reference &amp; Inside Windows NT Server 4 : Administrator's Resource Guide are the consequence of a publisher that is into fat books.  The truth be told, while the editions I reviewed are older copies, the newer editions soon to be released are slated to be even fatter!  The reality is that many readers do like the fat style of books.  For those who like books that interpret every step in a process (also known as spoon-feeding), and guide you through every step, no matter how elementary, such a reader will like books such as these.<br />Personally, I think books of this size are bloated and overpriced.  I would suggest that there is nothing wrong with being more concise and straight to the point.  A lean reference packed with information is much better than a fat reference book chock-full of a gluts of information.<br />Siyan &amp; Heywood are well-known NT guru's, each with a serious amount of industry experience.  While each book does cover an abundant amount of technical detail, they  often resemble warmed-over versions of the basic Microsoft Windows NT documentation.  There is an incredible amount of redundancy between the two books.  The combined books total nearly 2,600 pages, yet there is maybe 300 pages of variance between the two.  Each reference work has an enormous amount of step-by-step directions on how to perform a multitude of Windows NT tasks.<br />As an example, the Administrator's Resource Guide is rated by the publisher for the Accomplished to Expert level Windows NT user, yet I find it difficult to be of the opinion that an accomplished NT administrator would really need such rudimentary, procedural help.  The truth is the title should be renamed the Administrator's Bible or Administrator's Encyclopedia.  I have always found the most useful references are those that are thinner and to the point.  For the reader that truly desires such procedural and uncomplicated assistance, they would be better off utilizing the free NT Wizards that are an integral part of Windows NT 4.0.<br />Why are these books so fat?  Besides the symptom mentioned earlier, the explanation is that they are awash with page after page of screen shots.  Are hundreds of screen shots absolutely necessary?  For the experienced NT administrator who is looking for a reference and does not want to be spoon-fed, there is definitely no need to use that many screen shots.  My opinion is that screen shots should only be used where essential, not as a means to fatten books.  In the sections on adding a printer, there is no reason why over 10 screen shots should be used.  The problem is that the authors' often use a separate screen shot for each tab in a window.  Such a technique is not necessary unless the reader has no experience.  A preferred method to thin out the books would be to move the screen shots from the book to a CD-ROM.  Yet by doing that, books would become thinner and the publishers would lose a lot of valuable shelf space.<br />Another problem often encountered with fat computer books is that more often then not, such books have an extremely low knowledge-to-page ratio .  The low knowledge-to-page ratio is used to detail how much actual learning is gleaned per page.  When books are crammed with useless graphs, screen shots and illustrations, the knowledge-to-page ratio declines.<br />Tell me if this is too radical of a concept -- Would it not be appropriate for the publishers to simply assume that smart, intelligent people with experience are reading some of their books, and then attempt to make their books without every conceivable screen shot?<br />One publishing house that adheres to the &quot;Perhaps our readers are not stupid and don't need spoon-feeding&quot; is O'Reilly &amp; Associates ([...]  As an example, O'Reilly's Essential Windows NT System Administration by Aeleen Frisch (ISBN 1-56592-274-3) is only about third of the size (486 pages) of these books, yet has an extremely high knowledge-to-page ratio.  I would estimate that Frisch's book has at least three-times the amount of beneficial information than either Siyan's or Heywood's book.<br />The bottom-line is that what style of book you prefer is a personal choice.  Do you like to be spoon-fed and provided with endless pages of information with little added value?  If so, then these two books are expressly for you.  If you have experience with NT Server and do not need 25 pages detailing how to install a printer, you are likely to be better off by purchase Frisch's booko reason why over 10 screen shots should be used.

There seems to be a lot of Mark Twain wannabes writing computer books these days.  Perusing the latest NT titles, one gets the feeling that there is an unwritten requirement that technical books must be at least 3 inches thick.<br />Many NT books that claim to cover numerous topics come in at well over 1200 pages.  Not only do such books kills a lot of trees, they also are rather difficult to read while standing on a bus or subway.<br />How to Implement Microsoft Windows NT Server 4 humbly comes in at a rather modest 425 pages (or about 3 pounds).  Rather than trying to cover every imaginable feature of NT, it assumes that the reader has a substantial level of NT knowledge and is geared for more of an advanced user, as opposed to one that needs 20 pages of screen shots on how to install a printer driver.<br />The book is divided into 8 parts, compromising 39 chapters and 5 appendixes.  As stated earlier, the book get to the heart of the technical issue at hand, rather than spending scores of pages on a relatively simply idea.  Some chapters are as short as 2 pages, sparing you the often unneeded screen-captures than can add up to over 50% of a books page count.<br />Parts 1 -2 (chapters 1-10) deal with the initial setting-up and configuration of an NT server.  One of the enigmas of NT is that it is so easy to set-up, that inexperienced administrators can often set-up a system in a manner that later does not work or scale well.  The authors write that no matter how good or easy Windows NT Server is to use, it still is a complex operating system.  Given that caveat, throughout the book, it notes crucial areas in the installation and configuration process where utmost caution is required.<br />An interesting point brought up in chapter six is about the infamous Intel Pentium bug.  For the vast preponderance of NT Servers, the presence of a defective Pentium processor will have no effect.  This obviously can not be said for a workstation, but for an NT Server, there is little point in attempting to fix the problem via software.  For those users that somehow feel the need to perform this fix on a server, the author's write that the work-around may even harm system performance.  The bottom line: Apply those patches carefully and selectively.<br />Parts 3-4 of the book (chapters 11-25) accomplish in a little over 100 pages what other books take over 500 pages to state.  These chapters detail the bulk of the configuration of an NT Server.  Chapter 22 provides an excellent overview of the issues involved with directory replication.  NT has the ability to replicate directories and data across servers.  Replication is one of those little used, yet powerful features of NT.  Don't get all excited and throw out your copy of ArcServe, replication is meant only to copy specific directories and was never meant to replace an enterprise-wide backup solution.<br />Knowing that NT servers do not exist in a vacuum, Part 5 enumerates how NT can co-exist with other network operating systems.  There is a good overview on how to configure NT to operate with Novell NetWare, and for those Microsoft bigots, how to migrate from NetWare to NT.<br />One of the key selling features of NT is its bundling of Remote Access Services (RAS).  RAS is both powerful &amp; (when it works) easy to setup.  Part 6 takes about 35 pages to go over the RAS topics.<br />Part 7 specifies the particulars of setting up NT for the Internet.  It details the native Internet services available to NT and how the Internet Information Server operates.  Other peripheral issues such as web page creation, configuration DCHP, DNS &amp; WINS are dealt with.<br />Part 8 ends the book with every NT geeks favorite section, how to tune and tweak NT for maximum performance.  If you are into topics such as how to set threads, processor priority resolution and pagefile optimization, you will love this chapter.  The five bottlenecks of system performance are revealed.<br />As stated at the beginning of this review, the benefit of this book is its scope.  This book is not for everyone.  If you desire a title that will walk you through all of the steps involved in a specific process and the secondary minutiae, this is not the title for you.  This is not a &quot;for dummies&quot; type of book.  It is written for the accomplished to expert level of user.

The Process of Network Security is different in that respect, and it is indeed an effective introduction to the world of network security.<br />What differentiates this book from other introductory texts is that author Thomas Wadlow treats information systems security not as a set of different technologies, but rather as an integrated process. By viewing security as an evolving process, a network manager can create a security methodology that can develop into a strong foundation for the company's information security program.<br />The book is written for network managers and systems administrators who have been give different security responsibilities within their organizations and provides them with a comprehensive overview of the critical aspects involved with information systems security. While it is, of course, impossible to build security systems that are absolutely secure, the book demonstrates that a thorough process incorporating good designs can isolate security so that problems in one specific area aren't catastrophic to the entire system.<br />Wadlow is an industry veteran, and his experience shines throughout the book. The work covers all the major aspects of information security, including security team building, network monitoring, intrusion detection, and damage control. For those wanting a taste of what information security is all about, in a book written in a real-world format for an intelligent reader, this book is an excellent choice.<br />This review of mine originally appears at [...]	2000-10-30

Swing is a toolkit that attempts to simplify and streamline the development of the windowing components, namely the visual components (such as menus, toolbars, dialog boxes, etc.) that are used in GUI-based programs.  More information about Swing can be found at the Swing Connection home page at [...]  If you are short on cash, you could glean the bulk of the information provided by this book from the free resources available on-line at the Swing Connection and save yourself nearly fifty dollars.<br />While Java itself allows programs to be written once for different platforms, Swing components can be designed in such a way that they will execute without modification on any kind of computer with the identical look and feel of the operating system.<br />As an example, when you create a program with Swing for Windows 95, it will have the look and feel of an application written specifically for Windows 95.  When you run the same program under Solaris, it runs like an application written explicitly for Solaris.<br />Programming with JFC begins with an overview of Swing programming and Swing specific component.  The authors detail the difference between what the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) offers as opposed to the Swing-based model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.  More precisely, Swing sits on top of a number of the AWT API's.<br />The majority of the book details the features set of Swing, from its user interface classes, to its controls and implementation.  The authors start with simple controls before moving onto the more detailed issues of advanced controls such as trees and tables.<br />The book comes with a CD-ROM (naturally) that includes numerous examples, source code and a library of ready-to-use GUI components.  Also, similar material is also available via Swing Connection.<br />Overall, the book provides an excellent introduction to JFC.

The main benefit of the book is that it shows a diverse range of methods (better known as best practices) in which to approach and solve the Y2K quandary.<br />Since the book has contributions from over nearly 100 different authors, it reads a bit disjointedly, but Lefkon's skilled editing makes it bearable.<br />The theme and method of the book are based on the following suppositions: · Admit you have a Y2K problem · Get started solving the problem · Make choices in selecting outside help · Creating actions plans · Solving the problem before 12/31/99<br />By working with the above method, most Y2K problems, if set upon with enough rational thought and man-power, are readily solvable.<br />What is beneficial about the book is that it is filled with sample questionnaires, diagrams charts, tables, forms and overflowing with checklists.  In addition, the book has dozens of case studies from various companies and government agencies.  In that way, you can see what is appropriate for your environment and sector.<br />If there is any lacking in the book, it is that it does not provide enough detail about the  BCP (Business Continuity Planing) aspect of Y2K.  While your organization, might be 100% Y2K compliant, you customers, suppliers, etc., might not be.  What to do in that case, is what BCP is all about and what a lot of companies are dealing with now.<br />I found the book to be replete with loads of information and references.  It has one of the most extensive listings of Y2K related vendors, websites, and publications.  At $40.00, the book is well worth the amount of intelligence and wisdom it provides.At $40.00, the book is well worth the amount of intelligence and wisdom it provides.	2000-10-30

The authors are security veterans. Felton heads up the Princeton University Safe Internet Programming Team and is famous for discovering quite a few holes in the Java security model.<br />One might think that two security experts who know the depths and implications of Java security may come out with a reference with suggestions that are overly restrictive and perhaps paranoid.  That is not the case here.  The recommendations that the book suggests are rational and reasonable.  Java Security provides commendable guidelines on how to use Java more safely and what the future holds for Java security features.<br />The 6 chapters of the book provide an excellent and comprehensive analysis to all aspects of Java security.  Chapter 2 provides a significant amount of detail about the Java Security Model, with in-depth coverage of the 3 prongs (as they call it) of the security model, namely:  the Byte Code Verifier, the Applet Class Loader and the Security Manager.<br />Chapter 3 follows with a discussion detailing serious holes in the security model.  The authors consider a flaw to be serious when the breach has the potential to corrupt data, reveal private information, or infecting the workstation with a virus.  They fittingly note that all of the flaws detailed in the chapter have been fixed by Netscape and Microsoft.  The function of the chapter is to show what sort of things can go wrong.  Chapter 3 concludes with a summary of 8 significant security problems that were discovered last year in implementations of Java.<br />The book also goes into great detail on what developers and end-users can do to make Java much more secure.  Their six guidelines for Safer Java use are:<br />1. Know what web sites you are visiting 2. Know your Java environment 3. Use up-to-date browsers with the latest security updates 4. Keep a lookout for security alerts 5. Apply drastic measures if your information is truly critical 6.

The book, a fast-paced thriller, tells the real-life story of how a young man, with marginal intellectual capabilities, yet extremely tenacious and resolute, was able to penetrate hundreds of academic, financial, government, commercial and military computer networks.<br />The hacker who became known as &quot;Phantom Dialer,&quot; started his two year hacking escapade by reeking havoc on the network at the Portland State University in Oregon in 1991.  Once into the Portland State network, his used that site as a stepping stone to networks across the globe.<br />At around the same time that Phantom Dialer was causing damage, the FBI was starting its computer crime squad.  While almost as persistent in catching Phantom Dialer as the Phantom Dialer was anonymous, the dedicated members of the computer crime squad felt that while their efforts were valiant, it was nonetheless just a drop in the water, compared to the thousands of other hackers out there.<br />After a wire tap where the squad was able to determine who Phantom Dialer was, and where his base location was, the squad decided to raid Phantom Dialer's house, arrest him, and seize his computer equipment.<br />Once inside the house with a warrant, a rather humorous incident occurred.  The squad members went to Phantom Dialer's room and announced &quot;Open up -- FBI!&quot;, Phantom Dialer replied &quot;Shut up Steve (his brother), Do you think that I'm going to fall for that trick again?&quot;.<br />Phantom Dialer was arrested and jailed.  But due to his mental condition (borderline schizophrenic), prosecutors decided that they would not attempt to indict him since they felt that he could not truly understand the implications of his action.  Given that, prosecutors felt that no jury would have convicted him.<br />At Large is a good starting point for anyone interested in understanding how hackers operate. Written in a clear fashion, using technical jargon only when necessary, At Large makes for some interesting reading.arge is a good starting point for anyone interested in understanding how hackers operate.

Unix has been around for over 20 years and has a diverse group of experts and resources available.  Windows NT users on the other hand are not so fortunate.  NT has been around for only 4 years and in a truly usable version (starting with version 3.5) for a little more than two years.  When it comes to NT security, that can create a significant dilemma, due to the fact that notable security risks may arise without the administrators knowledge.  NT is still an immature operating systems as compared to Unix or NetWare.<br />Luckily, the Windows NT Security Guide is a salvation.  It serves as an excellent reference and training resource for navigating the often intricate waters of NT security. Steve Sutton is a seasoned computer security veteran and the book displays his expertise<br />This book covers all major security essentials of NT.  The main quality of the book is that it focuses completely on the real-world configuration of the NT security subsystem.  The book is not only a reference but an excellent training guide. Each chapter includes questions and exercises that enable the reader to put the information into operation.  It guides a security administrator on a step by step pilgrimage thought the maze of NT security..<br />Any book can show someone how to point and click and accomplish a task.  The preferred way is to educate a person into how the system and its strategies operates, and this is what the book accomplishes.<br />After completing the book, one will see that the NT security subsystem is strong, yet not a panacea.  This is due in part to the fact that NT has some old baggage due to its roots with its predecessor LAN Manager.  Nonetheless, NT has the capability to be a pretty strong system.<br />Because the textbook treats the security aspects of Windows NT from a day-to-day, operational point of view, it's a great way for system planners to evaluate its considerable security strengths, with or without NT in house.<br />If you have NT in house and are responsible for security, this book should be required reading.house.<br />If you have NT in house and are responsible for security, this book should be required reading.	2000-10-30

Just as physical security is becoming more noticeable in the workplace so too is information security becoming an indispensable component, as companies are putting their corporate jewels on publicly available networks.<br />Security was not part of the blueprint when the Internet was designed in the 1960s and 1970s. As the need for security became a pressing demand in the 1990s, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the overseer of the Internet, created Internet Protocol Security, or IPsec.<br />IPsec is a developing Internet standard for network-level security and is one of the most important security protocols to be developed in the last five years. IPsec is able to provide the level of transaction processing security that was lacking in the previous version of Internet Protocol.<br />While the authors do a good job of showing how IPsec works in theory, readers may find that there is not enough real-world information to justify its price. In large part that's because roughly one-third of the book is a copy of the IPsec RFC. Nor does the book detail how IPsec is specifically configured on devices such as routers and servers.<br />On the other hand, the book concludes with an excellent chapter about what to ask vendors. The questions provided in this book will help the prospective buyer differentiate between IPsec snake oil salesmen and those vendors whose products really do secure networks. Overall, however, the book is not required reading.<br />This review of mine originally appears at [...]	2000-10-30

In that sense, Distributed Unix System Administration: Team Procedures for the Enterprise is a book that parallels that saying.<br />The book is fact, really two books.  The first 9 of the books 11 chapters deal with Unix fundamentals.  The basics of file and block structure, shells, scheduling, processes, security and more are discussed.  While Wetsch does give a good overview of these topics, it is hard to justify spending $50.00 for those topics alone, when similar information is available free on the net.  If you do not want to spend a lot of money, check out the Unix FAQ at [...] for answers to nearly every Unix question.  Also, subscribing to the Usenet comp.unix.questions newsgroup is another good way to inexpensively get well informed about Unix.<br />The final two chapters of the book detail a program Wetsch wrote called SAmatrix. SAmatrix is an expert analysis tool designed to manage systems with the goal of bringing order, reliability and exception reporting to distributed systems.  The outgrowth is SAmatrix is an Enterprise System Assessment that accesses an organization's environment and determines if the organization is at risk, and if so, what action to take.<br />SAmatrix breaks down systems into 5 modules: software, hardware, network, security and operations.  Within the program, there are about a hundred questions.  After answering all of the questions, the program provides module risk assessments and levels of risk.<br />While SAmatrix has a lot of potential, the problem with it is that it in its current incarnation, is way too light of a program to do anything meaningful for complex environments.  The fact that it can not really be customized or its entries weighted, make the program for the most part unusable.  As an example, the fact that you can not weigh the SAmatrix entry of: are major system crashes less than 6 per year, is a problem since 6 major system crashes a year can be catastrophic for some environments (factory floor, hospitals, etc.) or a minor inconvenience for others (library, home use, etc.)  The main issue it that systems management is a very complex science.  Taming such a beast requires rather advanced tools, not the type that you will find in a $49.95 book limited to only two chapters.or system crashes a year can be catastrophic for some environments (factory floor, hospitals, etc.) or a minor inconvenience for others (library, home use, etc.)  The main issue it that systems management is a very complex science.
