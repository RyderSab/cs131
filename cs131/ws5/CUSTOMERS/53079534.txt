US	53079534	R1L9A47WBBCMNF	0471383384	629710903	Sold Short : Uncovering Deception in the Markets	Books	4	18	25	N	N	Fun and exciting story of battling the stock mkt bad guys	What makes this a fun read is the &quot;rogues gallery of thugs, schemers , and goofballs&quot; who are running stock market scams, and who vociferously object to Asensio's activities.  Stock scams tend to attract hysterical promoters with a flair for the dramatic.  I particularly enjoyed the little details - the guy who shows up in court in a dress, the threatening emails, the Maria Bartiromo connection.  What makes it exciting is Asensio's own precarious finances - he could go broke at any minute as he is hit with lawsuits and stock price manipulation that hurts the values of his holdings.<br />This guy is certainly not afraid of making enemies - his targets range from major investment banks to the SEC to Christie Todd Whitman - and, OK, I admit he seems a bit paranoid at times.  I'm also puzzled a bit by his faith in the efficient markets hypothesis - he says he doesn't believe in short squeezes because they don't reflect fundamental values, yet it seems to me the whole point of the book is that stocks can be overpriced.	2001-05-16
US	53079534	RR69868RW6BS9	0805060987	320220687	The Winter Soldiers: The Battles for Trenton and Princeton	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Excellent account of very human soldiers	A fascinating description of a few short months of fighting.  Reading the book, the reader gets a very strong sense of the human failings of the principle actors - their limited competence, scanty information, politically restricted sphere of action, and an unusual amount of back-biting and stupidity on the American side (along with unbelievable heroism).  Particularly interesting is the conflict between Washington and his would-be replacement General Lee.  <br />The book has really excellent portraits of the idiosyncratic characters on both sides (of course, the plentiful documentation from letters lets the characters speak in their own voice), even for minor characters such as General Sullivan.  And it movingly conveys the abundant confusion, cowardice, incompetence, and bravery of battle.<br />Although the book doesn't focus exclusively on Washington, one gets a strong sense of the man.  Washington's nearly fatal indecision (quite understandable in light of his weak political situation) in reigning in the independent Lee is striking.  Washington's political instincts and leadership come through strongly, as does his limited ability in matters military.  Here's a guy who lost nearly every battle he was in from an early age, spent most of his time running away, and often had only a handful of ill equipped, ill disciplined soldiers.  Yet he won the war.  This book helps explain why.	2001-02-26

A stellar read	For my money, this hilarious book is the best mystery by Crispin, better even than the (also wonderful) Moving Toyshop.  Literate, intriguing, and funny.  The book has a mood and flow that really comes together, with never a false note.  Scene after scene hits the mark, with high points including the testimony of the &quot;mullocking&quot; couple, Fen's speech to his political meeting, and the memorable and mellow final scene.  They don't write books like this anymore.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-23

The type of book that one can easily read in one sitting; entertaining, intelligent, thought-provoking without being a drag, action-packed but not mindless.<br />The silly premise (read the excerpt) is that a government conspiracy keeps deformed people from being cured, so that these unattractive individuals can be used as expendable explorers.  Geeze, I doubt we'll every have a shortage of unattractive people (beauty is a relative concept) - take a look out of a your window and you'll agree.  But this silly premise (with accompanying conspiracy theories and odd portrayals of society) is easily ignored by the reader.<br />As with many novels these days, the heroine has a Tragic Past and is the Victim of A Social Injustice - in her case, an unsightly birthmark.  Thus the protagonist does her requisite amount of complaining about her lot in life.  Fortunately, this ritual denouncement of social injustice is not intrusive (and it is a lot more pleasant to hear her complain about her birthmark than the usual writer's crutch of child abuse, incest, and alcoholism).	2001-01-20

The book has the same flaws as its predecessor - too much pointless sex, random and totally absurd behavior by some characters - but few of the virtues.  In particular, the book doesn't have much in the way of exciting new ideas.  It reminds me a bit of latter-day X-files (I stopped watching years ago), in that the story has run out of steam and is getting by with lots of conspiracies, illogical developments, and supposedly exciting intrigue.  I was happy when one of the main characters died, for I would no longer be forced to listen to his tiresome chatter.<br />Still, the author knows how to keep the story moving, and there is plenty of action and interesting world-building.  If you're looking to fill a few hours in a mostly pleasant way, this book will fit the bill.  But I would certainly recommend that you read &quot;Souls...&quot; first.	2001-01-15

Like his other books, this one is filled with adventure, mystery, exotic locales, and truth stranger than any fiction.  The book has heroes, villains (well, Mao anyway), overlooked episodes of extreme endurance, obscure triumphs, weird encounters, flamboyant madmen, bandits, hermits, and plenty of bizarre details.<br />The focus on one specific country makes this book more digestable and less sweeping than his other books.	2000-10-11

At  his best, he offers intricate world-building, exciting intrigue, and strong  characters.  <br />This book is not his best, and will certainly disappoint  many fans of his Culture series.  The plot has lots of fantasy elements and  boring anything-goes virtual reality sequences.  Although he has built an  interesting world here, the plot doesn't move along and the characters are  often annoying.  <br />Although worth a read for Banks fans like me, if you  haven't read the Culture novels, start there first (but avoid at all costs  his story of Scottish hippies, &quot;The Bridge&quot;).	2000-08-18

Captivating	As someone not particularly interested in Texas, weather, or disasters, I  expected this book to be boring.  It was not.  <br />The book contains much  interesting stuff about Cuban weather forecasters, the US bureacracy,  Galveston, and the career of the protagonist.  But at the heart is the  eerie, malignant hurricane and the reaction of the residents of Galveston.   If you want to know how your family might react in the face of death and  destruction - read this book.  <br />The reaction of husbands to wives as the  flood waters rose, the struggle for survival on a floating roof top, the  stranded railroad travellers and hapless steamship crews - this book is  filled with fascinating stories and vivid images.  At times the hurricane  has a dreamlike quality of sinister unreality.  <br />Although the book has a  depressing theme, its interesting and positive enough that I plan to reread  it.  At last,a  book that lives up to its rave reviews.	2000-08-18

Here, he breathes new life into the post-disaster re-building civilization genre.  The characters are  compelling, and the book has haunting images.  The book is chock full of  exciting adventure.<br />I agree with other reviewers that the book runs out  of steam, and the ending seems anti-climactic.  Often, the characters  behave in absurd ways.  For example, in their quest to retreive the lost  secrets of the 21st century, they (for no apparent reason) decline a  perfectly good opportunity to download an encyclopedia from a sentient  computer.  <br />Nevertheless, the book has enough virtues to overcome these  flaws.  Although the book has an often wistful mood (that sometimes becomes  maudlin), it also has humor.  My favorite scene involves the robot who  still stands guard at the bank - a scene you can't recall without smiling.	2000-08-17

These  extraordinary tales are far more exciting than any fiction.  Rather than  being a unified book, it is more like a collection of account of several  different stories.  Most of the stories (not quite all) are extremely  compelling.  The photographs are also revealing.<br />The book contains  unforgettable images and circumstances.  A few of my favorites: the plight  of WWI POWs stranded in the midst of the Russian civil war, the rescue from  the Soviet prison, the murderously insane Russian general, and the hapless  Indian revolutionaries whose Soviet-supplied invisible ink turned into very  visible ink in the humid climate of India.  Particularly striking was the  contrast of the Bolshevik purges and executions, and the British response  to treasonous Indians (the Bolshevik-trained Indians received extremely  light sentences after an extended trial).	2000-08-03

Frequent passages from  Victoria's girlhood diary and letters make Victoria's early life  particularly vivid reading.  Also fascinating is Victoria's relationship  with her government, and her tendency to cling to the current prime  minister and despise the Opposition, whoever they might be.<br />The enigmatic  Prince Albert, and his evolving relationship with Victoria, is presented  well.  Strachey makes some startling suggestions about what Britain might  have turned into, had Albert lived longer (answer: Prussia).<br />This book  is elegantly written, and free of the psychobabble one might expect from a  more modern book.<br />The book is not boring.  Although Victoria is always  proper, there is plenty of adultery and dysfunctional family behavior among  her many adult children.	2000-08-03
