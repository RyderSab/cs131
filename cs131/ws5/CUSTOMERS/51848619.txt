For people accustomed to large-scale engineering and atmospheric nuclear explosions, the Orion was not science-fiction. It was supposed to fly to Saturn by 1970 with them on board. Plagued by politics, Orion was shut down a few years after it started. <br />With this book, George Dyson mainly explores the childish optimism that characterized the early space age and the complicated political forces that destroyed it. Unfortunately, the book does not really detail the technology behind Orion, most of it being classified to this day.<br />Roughly organized chronologically, the text lacks structure, continuously bringing new names and facts, but without giving any clear idea to where it is going. The reader is dragged from one cryptically titled chapter to another, trying to filter out the useful information from the useless biographical details or quotes. <br />Obviously faced with a lack of technical information, the author still manages, from time to time, to inspire us with the vision of a massive ship, taking off in the middle of the desert on a trail of nuclear explosions, heading to Enceladus... or frightens us with the vision of a 15-cm nuclear bomb (using 1960 technology). Besides the bombs, the book also explains the other technological hurdles: pusher plate, heat and ablation, bomb ejection, shock absorbers, radiation and fallout. There are also a few drawings of the evolving Orion design and pictures of the small-scale, explosive-based tests.<br />The author also describes somewhat successfully the intricate and uninspired politics that ruled the space program at this time, as opposed to the optimism and enthusiasm of the young men behind it... but always reminding you that the same technology and enthusiasm created the bomb in the first place.<br />If this book is not really a pleasure to read, the main subject is fascinating and is worth reading for any space enthusiast, but is probably not good enough for the casual reader.	2002-09-04

Both authors are former executives of ESA and were directly involved in the definition of this plan, ensuring accurate information. Roger Bonnet was actually the head of the Science Programme for more than 20 years, and resigned only in 2000.<br />The first part of the text provides a historical background of the early days of cooperation in space among European nations, with the rise and fall of ELDO, and the transformation of ESRO into ESA in 1975. The book then continues with a explanation of how the very peculiar ESA system works: mandatory and optional programmes, the fair return system, the 120% cost overrun limit, etc. Diagrams are provided to synthesize the information.<br />Then, several international endeavours are being described: Giotto, the International Solar Polar Mission (which lead to Ulysses) or the ISS. For each, the role of ESA is explained, demonstrating the growing confidence of the Agency as it deals with more and more complex projects. Finally, the new international context, since the fall of the Soviet block and the rise of the European Union, sets the stage for the future of Europe in space.<br />This book, which is quite short, nonetheless provides the reader with a good idea of what ESA is, and how different it is from national organizations, such as NASA. Indeed, anyone frustrated by the repetitive project cancellations on the American side will be quite surprised to learn that not one ESA science project has ever been cancelled once approved, in more than 20 years. And only a few projects have suffered from major cost overrun... and they all involved some cooperation with NASA. As a consequence, it is quite clear from this text that both authors, who have been directly involved with those projects, share some resentment towards the US way of doing things.<br />Overall a good book, accurate and well written, if a little bit too short.<br />If you want to improve you overall knowledge of ESA, I would recommend the very interesting book from a professional anthropologist: &quot;Launching Europe&quot; by S. Zabusky (1995, ISBN 0691029725). In just under 300 pages, you will get an intimate view of the inner workings of ESA. For a very complete history, in 600 pages, you should read &quot;A New Force at a New Frontier&quot; by K. Madders (1997, ISBN 0521570964). You can also order (for free!) the annual reports from 1994 directly from the ESA web site.	2002-04-28

Instead, the text chronologically explores the evolution of the idea of Martian life in the last few centuries.<br />Mostly based on the scientific results of each period (except the last part), the author starts his expose with the knowledge acquired before the space age. The 'canali' of Schiaparelli turned into canals with Percival Lowell, which lead to the conclusion that a Martian civilization did exist. The debate raged for decades, until technological improvements finally killed the civilized Martians. Mars was a dead planet after all.<br />Then came the space age, the Soviet and American probes were sent to Mars, confirming Mars as a dead planet... but revealing a once warmer world, with rivers. And if Viking failed to detect life (did it?), what about extinct life?<br />The third part follows with the possibilities of fossil life and the famed Martian meteorite ALH84001. With a comparison of the origins of life on Earth, the chapter tries to deduce where life could be hiding now.<br />The final part leaves the area of science and enters the realm of conspiracies and telepathy, Cydonians, UFOs, movies and books. After all, they are all manifestations of Martian life, at least in our culture.<br />Quite easy to read, this book effectively covers the 'life' subject, and, as a bonus, provides an interesting look at the evolution or scientific knowledge. However, you won't learn much about the red planet, since the astronomical and geological data are quite rare, and, unfortunately, badly documented, contradictory or even false.<br />For a complete coverage of ALH84001, you may be interested in Donald Goldsmith's &quot;The Hunt For Life On Mars&quot; (1998, ISBN 0452278554).	2002-04-25

And the future seems even brighter, since the ESA is working on ambitious projects such as Mars and Venus Express, Darwin, BepiColombo or GalileoSat.<br />Twenty-five years before ESA was born, cooperation between the main European nations has been attempted, eventually leading to the creation of two organizations: one for science (ESRO), the other for rockets (ELDO). ESRO did achieve some success, but ELDO failed completely with its Europa launcher.<br />How did such a unpromising start led to such a promising future?<br />This book, &quot;A New Force At A New Frontier&quot;, starts from the beginning of it all (Sputnik), and chronologically relates what happened, why, and how it was handled. Mainly covering political and legal aspects, this book provides the space enthusiast with a highly detailed historical account. <br />Very precise, complete and technical (treaties and agreements are dissected almost point by point), the future reader must be aware that this text is definitly a research work done by a specialist, and not an ordinary, easy-reading book on the space program written a journalist. But learning about the politics involved is the only way to understand the ESA history.<br />Overall, an excellent reference that makes a good book, but for a limited readership, given its subject (ESA is not very well known, but this may change) and treatment (technical analysis of legal texts).<br />If you want to improve you overall knowledge of ESA, I would recommend the very interesting book from a professional anthropologist: &quot;Launching Europe&quot; by S. Zabusky (1995, ISBN 0691029725). In 300 pages, you will get an intimate view of the inner workings of ESA.

Indeed, the author manages to add a three-dimensional sense to the familiar constellation patterns. Let me explain.<br />The title can be a little bit deceptive: \\"Extreme Stars\\" doesn't mean \\"catastrophic stars\\", but really \\"the whole family of stars, from one extreme to the other\\", which is much more interesting anyway. Especially interesting because James Kaler is a professional astronomer and university teacher; and a gifted writer by the way.<br />The book is neatly organized. Each chapter deals with one such extreme: faintest, coolest, hottest, brightest, largest, youngest, oldest, strangest. The first chapter is missing from my enumeration, the one that deals with our Sun, which is our reference star for all the other chapters. So, for each category, the author clearly describes the various star types that fit the description, how they were discovered and understood, the physical origin of such an extreme state, what may come after for the star, etc. <br />But beyond this neat organization, you will discover that stars are really a confusing matter: one star can fit several extremes at the same time, and even get from one extreme to the other during its life... and back. As we travel in (or out of) the main sequence, all types are explained: O, B, A, F, G, K, M, L (and T), DO, AGB, white dwarfs, giants, supergiants, hypergiants, neutron stars, Wolf-Rayet (WN and WC), planetary nebulas, novae, supernovae, black holes, etc. And if you are confused by the plethora of denominations and the apparent lack of unifying scheme in the naming of star types, understand that this is an heritage of a few centuries of equally confused astronomers (still) trying to understand what they were (are) observing.<br />And throughout the book (when possible), the author links an extreme star with one well know lightin our night sky: Betelgeuse, Antares, Alpha Centauri, the Orion Nebula, Deneb, etc. Some of the visually brightest stars are bright because they are close to us, some because they are far but extremely active. Some constellations have many bright stars that are really physically close to each other. Some variables or binaries can be easily observed in action, while some other do move against the background in just a few years.<br />All those connexions of theories to the real sky gives a tremendous multi-dimensional perspective to the otherwise \\"flat\\" sky. Well done.	2002-04-18
US	51848619	R1WPBLMMYYLJRG	0691029725	493761703	Launching Europe	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Very instructive account from inside ESA, by an outsider	My goal with this book was to learn something different about the European Space Agency. You can learn a lot about the philosophy, the goals and the scientific programmes from the ESA web site or specialized news sites. But compared to all the available literature about NASA's inside politics and inner workings, surprisingly little has been published about what actually happens inside the ESA. \\"Launching Europe\\" corrects this superbly.<br />The complete title of this book is \\"Launching Europe: An Ethnography of European Cooperation in Space Science\\", and on the back cover, you can read that this book should be found in the \\"Anthropology\\" section of your bookstore: this is not an error. This is neither an engineering document nor a scientific report of the ESA projects, but an in-depth analysis of the human interactions. And a very technical one: the author is a professional anthropologist, and this text really looks like an authentic anthropological research: the vocabulary is very specific, the methodology is precise, the bibliography extensive.<br />But even if you are not, like me, a specialist in this field, this will be a very instructive book. Indeed, the ESA science department is a very complex environment, where hundreds of people from more than fifteen countries work together on high-tech projects. In such a challenging environment, you can expect some intriguing things to happen, and the author successfully pinpointed and explained the problems and solutions devised by the participants, such as the scientist/engineer, or technical/management oppositions, the endless meetings, the pressure from deadlines or financial constraints, etc. For example, being fluent in English is not an asset, even though most of the communication is in English. It's also interesting to note that there is almost no hierarchy, but a culture of voluntarily assumed responsibilities. And since no decision can be taken unilaterally without formal hierarchy, absolutely everything goesthrough tense but effective negotiations. And of course, there is more.<br />In addition to this purely anthropological exercise, and in order to describe completely the system the people work in, the author also details the historical and structural background of the agency. Combined with the in-depth analysis, this high-level view of the system helps the reader to grasp how such a complicated system achieves its success. This complementary information will detail the ESTEC buildings, laboratories, cantina, etc. as well as the steps taken by a project from idea to satellite, from management decisions at the Paris headquarters, through the peer-review system and up to the flight approval tests.<br />Only one thing was missing (maybe): even if ESA cannot be directly compared the NASA, this exercise is inevitable. Asides from a few lines here and there, this book doesn't talk about NASA at all. You will then have to do this by yourself.<br />Overall, a good book, not (only) for space enthusiasts, but (also) for those interested in the challenges faced by those who have the courage to cooperate on an international level... and succeed.<br />If you want to improve you overall knowledge of ESA, I would recommend the concise but interesting book from two insiders (who actually helped define the highly successful \\"Horizon 2000\\" programme): \\"International Cooperation in Space: The Example of the European Space Agency\\" by R. Bonnet and V. Manno (1994, ISBN 0674458354). In just under 200 pages, you will get the historical and political background of the agency. For a very complete story, in 600 pages, read \\"A New Force at a New Frontier\\" by K. Madders (1997, ISBN 0521570964).

Written by an expert in string theory, the subject of this book is specifically the superstring theory. Starting with the historical facts about relativity and quantum mechanics, the book guides the reader through the basics of string theory, and then builds on to introduce more and more complex concepts, and concludes with the possible developments that may emerge in the future.<br />Although this field of physics is mostly a mathematical construct, the author manages to guide the reader through the superstring theory by using non-technical terms and simple analogies, supported by a clear and precise writing style. Of course, you should not expect to be able to grasp the meaning of a 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau space after reading this book, but I guess it's the closest anyone can get without explicit mathematical formulas.<br />Besides the Calabi-Yau space, you will also be introduced to the Planck time, Planck length, Planck mass and Planck energy, to curled and circular dimensions, to a new definition of the concept of distance (where R is indistiguinshable from 1/R), and to the M-Theory (which may be the &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;), among other things.<br />As the necessary concepts are introduced, the applications of the superstring theory are explained: particle physics, spacetime, cosmology, etc. Since the author is himself a specialist in string theory, you will feel that he gets more and more enthusiastic as the book advances to cutting-edge subjects, such as the superstring explanation to a black hole (is a black hole a giant elementary particle?) or the role of superstrings in the Big Bang. Enthusiastic, but always clear and precise.<br />An excellent book on a subject that is evolving as we speak: the kind of book that makes you think you understand, even though you know you cannot really understand... And since the theory is being built right now, you can wait for a few years and grab another book to get the latest news!	2001-12-29

You couldn't be more wrong! What you have here is a highly technical, accurate and up-to-date scientific review of our present state of knowledge about the Red Planet.<br />The text and presentation is completely similar to the articles found in the scientific publications such as &quot;Science&quot;: text split on two columns, black-and-white pictures, graphics and bibliography. <br />In order to get the most out of this book, you must already have some good knowledge of the planet and of geology, because the author does assume that you know a lot of things and will not bother explain the basics. From this point of view, this book is a welcomed surprise for the Mars enthusiasts like me, because it brings you one step (or more) further. For the beginners, you should avoid this book, and get instead the beautiful &quot;Mars : Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet&quot; (by P. Raeburn, National Geographic, ISBN 0792273737).<br />Now, for those really willing to learn about Mars with this book, let's get into the details. <br />As I said, you should know about Mars before reading this book. The best way to get there is to read the massive &quot;Mars&quot; (University of Arizona Press, ISBN 0816512574). This 1500-page Mars bible covers everything, but is in some way outdated (published in 1991, before Phobos 1 &amp; 2, Pathfinder, and MGS). This is where the book by Cattermole becomes complementary, and could be considered as an update of the other one.<br />The large majority of the chapters are on Martian geology: plains, volcanism, craters, polar regions, fluvial activity, etc. Every aspect is covered in great details, including the latest results from MGS. But unless you are a trained geologist (like the author), you will probably be a little overwhelmed by the vocabulary. But even witha partial understanding of the science, the wealth of information is worth the effort. A piece of advice: get a map of Mars and keep it with you while reading.<br />Only a few chapters are about the atmospheric conditions, the satellites or even the possibility of life on the planet. This is not surprising since the bulk of our current knowledge is about geology, but may leave you disappointed. Especially the chapter on weather and climate: quite a lot is known about Martian weather, but this chapter is confusing and ambiguous, revealing that the author is not an expert in this field.<br />Regrettably, this book suffers from many errors, typographical or worse. I have spotted 2 figures where the curves are not even printed, leaving the arrows pointing nowhere (fig. 4.5 and fig. 13.2); fig. 3.7 is weirdly centred at 31.53°S 130.73°N; fig. 8.9 is centred at an impossible 241°N (!) and on p.89 we learn that Apollinaris Patera is lying at 96°S; fig. 9.8 lacks the &quot;solid line&quot; used in the explanation; on p.48, we learn that the upper limit for micrometeorites is 1 billion kg (which does not sound very microscopic)... The list could go on. This is unfortunate, because the scientific quality of this book is weakened by the fear of reading something erroneous because of poor proof-reading. <br />Despite the many errors, this book is an impressive summary of our current knowledge, and is worth reading. And with the arrival or Mars Odyssey, you will be well prepared.	2001-12-20

The first reason could be that the book was good, and it left somewhat smarter than before. The other case is because the book was not so good and I am happy no to read it any longer. Unfortunately, this book belongs to the second category. Unfortunately, really, because the subject and the hypothesis developped in &quot;At Home In The Universe&quot; definitly deserve a better treatment.<br />I was brought to this book by the excellent &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; (by S. Levay and D. Koerner ), which had a complete chapter on self-organization theories and the origins of life. Based on this captivating first glimpse into the world of artificial life experiments, I decided that the book by Kauffman was worth a try. Well...<br />First, the good news: the book does explain all the generalities and details on self-organization and the possible applications, from the origins of life to economics and politics. The ideas are very innovative, and even if those theories may not correctly explain everything (a possibility wisely pointed out by the author), they do add something new and worth exploring. The chapters on autocatalytic chemical sets are the most interesting, and convinced me that luck and Darwinian evolution do not completely explain why life exists, and how it achieved such a complexity.<br />Now, the bad news. The writing style is a killer: egocentric, prophetic, repetitive, grandiloquent and lyrical. Egocentric, because the author keeps on talking at the first person, which is annoying and useless. Prophetic, because the author believes too much in the ultimate success of his own theories. Repetitive because having ten or more paragraphs in a row explaining the exact same thing again and again cannot be qualified differently. Grandiloquent and lyrical can be good when Sagan does it, but most of the time it's just clumsy. With this book, you will go even lower: ridicule.<br />Conclusion: 3 stars: 4 stars for the ideas and1 star for the style. The subject deserves a better treatment. So, if someone knows of another book on the subject, please, contact me.	2001-12-13

The author gradually guides the reader through the science of these small icy objects, which existence was suspected almost 50 years before their actual discovery.<br />Introductory historical and theoretical chapters, covering the period from the discovery of Pluto and the next decades, are followed by more and more discoveries and scientific results, most of them not older than 10 years. From the first Centaurs to the extrasolar dust disks observations, every aspect is clearly explained, and ultimately provides a complete picture of this region of the solar system.<br />Throughout this chronology, the author explains the science as well as the way this science is actually done, up in the observatories in Hawaii, or in an university office, in front of a computer screen. It is a very honest tribute to the people (the author being one of them) that spend most of their time trying to set-up complex experiments, understand the cryptic data sent back by their high-tech instruments, and then write articles about things they are usually the first to analyze.<br />This book is short because not much is known yet. But it is fascinating because almost everything we know has been discovered in the last 10 years, and you can expect more in the very near future. In order to get the most of what we be published, this book is the place to start.<br />And for those, like me, who are interested in the far regions of the solar system, I would recommend this other book about the &quot;King of the Kuiper Belt&quot;, Pluto, written by another specialist (Alan Stern): &quot;Pluto and Charon&quot;. It's a good complement to this one.	2001-11-21

The subject is, of course, the recent discovery of the non-zero &quot;cosmological constant&quot;, that accelerates the expansion of our universe exponentially.<br />In order to guide the reader through the theories, Goldsmith starts with the historical facts, starting with Einstein's view of the Universe, deciphering the results of the &quot;type Ia Supernovae&quot; research groups, and explaining the COBE satellite data and the gravitationnal lensing effect. Each concept is explained, each theory gradually introduced, and, as the reader understands more and more of it, Goldsmith even manages to expand the book with the alternative explanations that might be revealed with the futures set of instruments (MAP and Planck). <br />So, on the science side, Goldsmith did a great job, complete and objective, similar in quality to his other book &quot;The Hunt for Life on Mars&quot;.<br />However, several paragraphs (and even one or two chapters), that deal more with the scientists involved, are too long, not very well written, breaking the rythm of the book. Also, he sometimes try to explain some formulas without even writing them once, which makes everything more confusing than necessary. <br />Anyway, this book is worth reading, and is probably the most complete introduction you can get on this topic. And now that MAP is flying, you can expect more results to be published in the next few years, and you will understand what it's all about.	2001-11-16

It does describe the apparent fine-tuning of each of them, describing what the universe would be like if the value was changed. And the results are really suprising: from infinite voids to black holes smaller than an atom, with everything in between.<br />But this book does more than this: it really uses these numbers as a starting point to explain the latest understanding and theories on astronomy, cosmology, the Universe we exist in, its origin, its fate, and of course, the reason (or lack of) for us being alive in it in the first place.<br />Very well written and short enough to avoid digressing into personal philosophical opinions, it provides a humbling yet mind-opening introduction to the cosmos. A very good introduction to the vast world of cosmology.	2001-11-14

But...<br />Most of the pictures are really beautiful, but some of them are not that good, to be honest. The author even managed to select some pictures that were definitly out of focus, etc. Not that I don't appreciate this artistic side, but I would definitly have preferred the most perfect pictures available.<br />And the selection also falls a little short! There are not so many pictures, considering that some of the first are not even about the Moon missions, and some are just duplicates of each other.<br />And maybe it would have been a good idea to include some pictures from other Moon probes, such as the Ranger probes, or even the Soviet Luna probes (and rovers!), which are extremely hard to find (thanks NASA for keeping them out of reach!). It would have been, IMHO, much more interesting than some blurry pictures from the Gemini programme.<br />You don't buy this book to learn something, that's for sure, even though the text at the end is quite interesting (thanks to Mr. Chaikin). You buy this book to get a feeling of what it was like to be up there. And you can actually get some of that feeling. It's just sad that it's the closest you can get, and probably will ever get.	2001-10-31

Go beyond the Propaganda with this book.<br />Massively documented, dense and well written, this book is a treasure to anyone interested in the space race, the men and women behind it, the politics involved, between nations, ideologies, and especially between individuals.<br />With &quot;Korolev&quot;, you follow the rise and fall (to the Gulag), and rise(!) of the man that took on himself to beat the Americans, fighting against the Party, the lack of interest from his leaders, his enemies, and of course, some technological problems. <br />It's hard to comprehend what could have motivated anyone to work during this troubled era with such devotion and faith in his country, even after having been sent for no reason to Siberia for 7 years during the Stalinist Terror.<br />And yet, it's this period of space history that saw Sputnik, Gagarin, Vostok and Venera, as well as a number of &quot;circus acts&quot;, as they said, that scared the USA about a possible &quot;Communist Moon&quot;. It's also the Soviet space program that will create the most ingenious space technology ever built (read &quot;Russia In Space&quot; about the RD-180, or the NK-33 rocket engines, built in the 60's).<br />It's worth noting that the author never tries to revise history: facts, facts and facts, explained in their context. I am just waiting for such a book to be written on the US space program, the only country with China that still uses propaganda...

Indeed, it predates by a few years PathFinder, Global Surveyor and the brand new Odyssey. But you just cannot invalidate 1500 pages of science in a few years, so I bought it.<br />Well, I was not disappointed! There is one (or more) chapter for every topic you could think of about Mars. And each chapter contains tons of scientifically accurate data, presented in an completely neutral way. Basically, everything is new, or if I thought I knew it, the book just goes way further.<br />This book is not for the casual reader. You must be highly motivated and/or and technically-educated to make the most of it.<br />And, of course, you must realize that this book is only a summary of what you could learn about the planet if you had the time (and mental capacity) to handle all of it. <br />And, you should also be aware that this book is only one book about one planet. Because the Arizona Press has &quot;a few&quot; other books, about &quot;Mercury&quot; (800 pages), &quot;Venus II&quot; (1500 pages), &quot;Uranus&quot; (1076 pages), &quot;Neptune and Triton&quot; (1249), &quot;Pluto and Charon&quot; (728 pages), etc.<br />As soon as I have finished &quot;Mars&quot;, I will go and buy the rest (one at a time), because you just can't beat this collection.	2001-10-30

This is very refreshing because Venus is often overlooked in most books, that usually focus more on the binary comparison of Mars vs the Earth, and, in many ways, Terra is actually closer to Venus than Mars.<br />The text itself is clear, accurate and very entertaining to read (especially the footnotes!). Everything is based on scientific facts, except the last chapter, that digresses a little too much from the main subject, but it's ok.	2001-10-30
US	51848619	R2I0FSIP92SVLT	1896522629	508222029	Mars: The NASA Mission Reports: Apogee Books Space Series 10 (Includes CDROM: Mars Movies and Images)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Space history, and a look at what we missed	It's hard to get more technical, but it's exactly what you need if you want to have a look at the technology that was used to conquer that &quot;final frontier&quot;, starting about 40 years ago. It was definitly a time where exploration was risky, and NASA was actually willing to risk it. <br />Those little probes were so rudimentary compared to what we can do now, and yet, they were state-of-the-art machines that were launched one after another to the planets... with equally deceiving and surprising results. When you think that the Viking data is still being used (and the new results are still controversial), it's hard not to be impressed.<br />Ironically, this book, which may have been a tribute to NASA creativeness, ends up with the Mars Observer, Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter reports, three probes that failed. The failure is definitly not the problem, because most of the Mars probes failed. But NASA attitude has dramatically changed since the first Mariner. A failure was merely a plausible outcome, but now, it's a catastrophy that invokes a complete Mars programme reeavaluation...<br />And to kill it completely, this invaluable little book includes the Werner Von Braun infamous roadmap to Mars... envisionned for the 1980's. Another sad hint that NASA failed to its destiny, and will probably never recover.<br />This book shoudl definitly be read with some other good space history books, that will help put the technical prowess in perspective. I would recommend the following:<br />- Failure is Not An Option, by Gene Kranz<BR>- Korolev, by James Harford<BR>- Russia In Space, by Brian Harvey<BR>- Moon Hunters, by Jeffrey Kluger	2001-10-30

The book presents, chapter after chapter, the points of view of differents scientists (and a few pseudo-scientists) on the subject of life: its nature, definition, origin, rules, etc. The underlying subject is extraterrestrial life, but, in order to discuss it properly, the text does not focus on SETI only, for example, but asks renowed biologists, mathematicians, roboticists and Artificial Life experts what their work about life is all about.<br />You end up with a very well written text, that gives some speech-time to everyone, including (regrettably, IMHO) creationnists and ufologists. <br />Funny thing: in the end, you probably still won't know what life is!	2001-10-30

An interesting look at the space program from a non-american source, that gives the reader a text free of the usual &quot;national&quot; chauvinism (and a little bit a German-centric comments!).<br />But, most of all, it's an excellent source of information about the Galileo probe, from its 1970 original concepts to its long-delayed launch (which makes you wonder if NASA really cares about science). You will also find an excellent (and, of course, premature) synthesis of what we thought we knew about Jupiter and its moons, and what we think we now know...<br />Even though this english edition has been revised since the original 1998 German release, especially about Europa, you can expect most of its scientific content to be outdated in a few years from now... but, no, you shouldn't wait for another book, because the Viking probes, 25 years after their mission, are still giving up some secrets about Mars. So you can expect a few decades of data mining before having exhausted the information locked up in the Galileo database.<br />Enjoy your trip!	2001-10-30
US	51848619	R4VHHHIUBZLCO	0452278554	868658334	The Hunt for Life on Mars	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Complete and objective	A pretty good book, that clearly explains, one by one, all the evidence brought forward by the NASA team about the ALH84001 Martian meteorite. Totally objective, very precise, easy to read, it will definitly help you understand what it's all about. <br />Only in the end does the author expresses his personnal view on the subject, but at least, you are then able to judge by yourself.<br />This is the kind of book Benjamin Bratt (from the movie &quot;Red Planet&quot;) should have read before saying &quot;How do you know it's authentic? How do you know its not toxic, that's the bigger question.&quot;.<br />READ! And learn, before you say anything stupid...	2001-10-29

I originally bought this book after reading an summary in a science magazine, as I wanted to know more about their ideas... The problem is that, after reading this book, I still want to know more about their theory! Because the summary I read was so well done that it contained all the book in 5 pages instead of a few hundreds, that just keep repeating themselves again, and again, again... I would have preferred a condensed, shorter text, because the subject is very interesting in itself.	2001-10-29

Not so for the biographical element in it, but more for the NASA internal politics description. Is it normal for the supposedly &quot;leading space agency in the (free) world&quot; to have such a complicated and unproductive way of doing science?<br />In this book, you will learn how &quot;the most successfull Mars mission&quot; of the last few years (mainly a technology feat and not science, but, hey...) was build by a handful of people, without real support or confidence from the upper management... Visionnary? Not really! But this upper management didn't lose time, when it finally worked, to claim this success!<br />And, of course, you will also get some technical details, and feel a little what it's like to a &quot;six wheels on the ground&quot;. An overall interesting book!	2001-10-29

If you don't know much about the &quot;King of the Kuiper Belt&quot;, read this book, and you will have a very clear scientific description of this &quot;massive comet&quot;...<br />This book is complete, starting from the historic discovery (blind luck, really) of Pluto, the subsequent observations that kept on shrinking the planet, then the suprising discovery of Charon, the fortuitious Pluto/Charon occultation, and the latest HST results. <br />Easy to read, and yet technical enough, this book will probably make you love this planet, even though it's only a big comet saved from destruction by its orbital resonance with Neptune... and will make you hate NASA (or the US Congress) for not going forward with their Pluto Express probe.	2001-10-29

This book is a mix of thoughts by Carl Sagan, which he mainly dictated while crossing North America in a car. Well, it shows! It jumps from interesting paragraphs to useless personnal experiences, and the final result is a short text that is confusing, and (but that's not his fault) outdated. Read &quot;Cosmos&quot; and &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, they are much better.	2001-10-27

The cover says &quot;Comets&quot;, but the text is not entirely devoted to the science of comets. It skims a lot of related subjects, but sometimes digresses a little too much. And this book is definitly popularized too far! Popularization is no excuse for (small) errors. IMHO, you'd better read &quot;Cosmic Pinball&quot; instead.	2001-10-27

The book is not so good because Brandenburg is a little bit alarmist, but I won't really complain about that. The but is quite bad because Brandenburg seems to have some score to settle with someone, and IT SHOWS! A little bit partial, uh? And the book is really bad, because some of the science in there is completely bogus, and it stains all the rest...	2001-10-27

The numbers are really what impressed me in this book... especially because they are really conservative! The potential of our own little solar system is absolutely incredible, and Lewis explains it very well.

The book is quite good, and I learned quite a lot (I don't know much anyway) about geology and planetology. But, the story of Mr. Holmes is not that interesting.

The quality and imagination of the russian space program is incredible, and it would be a invaluable loss if it had to collapse completely... because it may very well be this program that will get us out of our craddle.	2001-10-26
