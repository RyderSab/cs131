The artwork is colorful, beckoning each reader to come in and have fun. <br /> <br />The rhyming prose speaks in a child's language, engaging them to think in the form of analogies.  <br /> <br />\\"Gull is to sky as shell is to sand.  Child is to family as finger is to hand.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Water is to wet as towel is to dry.  Arm is to swim and wing is to fly.\\" <br /> <br />These are just some of the examples.  The sensory detail is rich and inviting.  Going on a car journey?  What a great game to have your children think of their own analogies.	2005-05-15

Chick lit is meant to be brain candy...a break from historical novels or classics, and this one is yummy!  Our heroine here decides to apply and attend graduate school in the UK, motivated by her ex saying there wasn't a chance she'd get in, much less graduate.  This is a light read & reminds each of us not to take life so seriously.      The setting of this book is an invite to visit Britain: evenings at the pub and walks along country lanes.  If you are an Anglophile or even if you haven't been yet, the description of this college campus is enough to make you want to re-visit or go for the first time.	2004-11-10

This book is broken down into three sections: elementary, intermediate, and advanced.  This has been a favorite of mine in all my classrooms: with 1st graders, with non-English learners, and with adults learning to read for the first time.   <br /> <br />The phrase is listed, then a definition, then a couple of examples of how it's used.  Following a list of ~10 phrases, there is a set of exercises that tests knowledge of the phrase and sentences to fill in the blank. <br /> <br />There is an answer key at the back to allow students independence to check answers.   <br /> <br />This is a great teaching and reference tool for all classrooms.	2004-10-03

I applaud Barron's Educational Publishing for coming up with such a great book!  This isn't a general grammar book, but cuts to the chase re: homonyms.  <br /> <br />It's touted as an ESL Homonym Workbook, but I've used it in my first grade classroom.  This does not mean it looks down on the non-English speaker, but it is a universal text for people of all ages who are looking to master English as a language. <br /> <br />The set-up of each page is simple in design and allows a teacher to isolate words.  For example, \\"pail\\" and \\"pale\\" are listed.  Below the heading of words, each is listed with its definition, as well as 3 sentences to show how the word should be used.  Below that, practice exercises are listed.  These include 5 sentences with a blank in each.  The student reads the sentence and determines which homonym is best suited for the sentence.  Below that there are 2-3 lines to allow students to write their own sentences.  At the very bottom of the page and upside down, answers to the first exercise are listed.   <br /> <br />If any words used on the page were previously used in another exercise, there is a box on the right saying \\"Previously Used Words.\\"   <br /> <br />I think this is a great teaching tool, and it has allowed me to work one-on-one with students.  Where there was once confusion, these exercises have allowed my students to grasp the concept.	2004-10-03

This book is great in the sense that it is a basic book to allow a non-English speaker to learn to make conversation.  Filled with pictures and sketches, it allows the reader to interpret the scene.   <br /> <br />Ten chapters break conversation into usable pieces, such as Personal Identification (who you are; how old you are, etc.), family, health, transportation, housing, food, clothing, as well as others.  Also, American money is shown in coin and dollar form and allows the student to study the amounts of each.  <br /> <br />At the start of each chapter, there is a list of essential vocabulary.  This is best used with a tutor so that the learner can hear the pronunciation of various words and sounds.   <br /> <br />What I love the best about this book is that it allows students a sense of autonomy.  They can make notes on pictures and words, and it provokes discussion so the student is forced to interpret the scene and then translate it to the tutor.  This also allows insight to the teacher to know what to work on and what is no longer a problem for the student. <br /> <br />	2004-10-03

Funny Fairy Tale Math is like slipping veggies into a child's dinner unseen.   <br /> <br />Kids who think they hate math will be tantalized to see all the real-life applications of math in fairy tales, as well as real life applications.  The 15 fairy tale stories include Rapunzel, Paul Bunyan, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Billy Goats Gruff, as well as others. <br /> <br />Instead of just a story, though, children have a concept associated with each.  For example, Rapunzel has great activities to reinforce subtracting 2 and 3 digit numbers; Paul Bunyan reinforces multiplication facts; the Three Little Pigs reinforce perimeter and area; and the Three Billy Goats Gruff reinforce the math concept of money. <br /> <br />What a great resource for every classroom.  This book shows that math can be great fun!  The stories are reproducible and the accompanying word problems work with essential math concepts and meets the newest NCTM standards. <br /> <br />Betsy Franco has brought a great piece of fun to the teacher's professional book shelf. <br />	2004-10-03

The step-by-step guide allows students to work at their own pace, as well as with a tutor or without.  The 16 chapters break down language into appropriate segments such as Subjects and Predicates, More about Nouns, Pronouns, More about Verbs, Types of Sentences, 3 sections on puncutuation, as well as other grammar \\"must-knows.\\"   <br /> <br />What's the bonus?  There is a chapter on letter writing that covers a friendly letter vs. a business letter vs. a job application.  This chapter served my adult students in a huge capacity to allow them to see how English was used in each style.   <br /> <br />Also, there is an answer key at the back so students could test themselves throughout the chapters and then check out answers as a self-guided test.   <br /> <br />Overall, this has beena brilliant teaching tool for me and has aided students more independence in becoming proficient English speakers.	2004-10-03

Poets such as Jane Yolen, Jack Prelutsky, Lee Bennett Hopkins and others have written a personal letter to children regarding what poetry means to them, as well as how it is incorporated into their personal lives.  <br />  <br />Followed by this letter is one of their poems.  It's like having a real discussion with the poet and then watching him/her perform through their work.   <br /> <br />My favorite was Anthony Hudgins because his letter mentioned that he's always got a book of poems by his bedside to help him unwind from the day, one in his car in case he gets stuck anywhere, and always one in the bathroom.  Hudgins points out  that this is better than a novel because with poetry \\"you can finish your body business and your poetry business\\" at about the same time...not so with a novel, especially if your memory is not so keen. <br /> <br />He follows his letter with the poem \\"Grandmother's Spit.\\"  This poem reminded me of countless older ladies who would spit on their fingers and then swab away some food or dirt from my cheek, for the sake of sanitation.   <br /> <br />The book closes with a Notes section on the contributors, allowing another glimpse into a poets' life, one that says, \\"Yes, we are real people with real families and we like real things...and we show it through our poetry.\\"	2004-09-28

You can always use it as reference material later, but the book is great whether you read it for the 1st time or 51st time.  Bravo, Cay Lang!	2003-07-22

Write, write, and write is what you must do to become published, but you must have your own space to do so.  Virginia Woolf's testament to that resounds just by the fact that her writing has survived various generations to still be read today.	2003-07-22

SARK's inspiration sandwich will allow you to sink your teeth in and come out satisfied from the experience.  She has a lighthearted way of discussing serious subjects...a way that reminds each of us that we are not alone.  The bright colors of the book do not distract from her writings, but enhance them.  Her stories entertain and delight, but above all, they comfort.	2002-06-18

Matera's journalistic style is fresh and wide-eyed, and the reader is pulled in from the beginning.  Putting it down once started is not an option.  It compels the reader to find out when they are next able to meet.  Their joys and sadnesses are shared so vividly that they become real.  This is not a book to be taken lightly.  Curl up on a Saturday morning and spend the day reading.	2002-06-18

She shares both in this book so that others may know what the experience is like.  <br />My favorite part is where she is working with students and the class is working on the poem &quot;Eggs&quot; and students ponder what is it really like to sit in a bathtub of eggs.  The words are so strong they don't just invite visualization, they demand it.  <br />Having sat in on a Zona Rosa meeting, I can say that working with Rosemary Daniell is just as electrifying.	2002-05-23

Returning recently to my mother's house, I needed some reading material for the plane ride home, and took this with me.  I was entranced once again.  To have your own special place to hide, to read, to have an adventure...a dream come true.  As the excitement built up toward the end, I found myself riveted and couldn't put the book down.	2002-05-23

Being recent transplants to California, my husband and I have been checking out all the nooks and crannies that make California unique.  With the printing of this book, we are reminded there is so much more to see and to learn.  From Alcatraz to Yosemite, there are adventures abounding.  The illustrations for this book are beautiful, and invite you to be a part of goldmining or the California labs of Silicon Valley.  Teachers would do well to introduce this book to their students, in and out of California.  Parents would allow their children's horizons to be expanded, if only by introducing this book to them.  This will be a favorite of mine for years to come.	2002-05-23

She has found the heart and soul of a woman who is fiercely independent, and shared it with her readers.  Catherine is a woman who struggles with her sense of self because society has dictated the rules, but she doesn't fit.  She is the square peg and the world around her is the round hole.  No matter which way she turns or who she tries to please she is distinctively herself, much to her fiancee's chagrin.  As the story moves on, we are witness to her family and friends, all who support her and love her as she struggles to figure out who she is and what she wants.  Every woman needs a safety net such as this underneath them, and Hruby brings it home.	2002-05-23

Concrete poems force you to dance, shimmy, and shake when read.  These are not poems that tiptoe around a subject.  They stomp! They laugh out loud...and this laughter is contagious!  I find myself going back to the book time and time again...just one more peek, I tell myself for the 37th time.    <br />This collection of poems is a language lover's dream!  It is a juggler throwing words up in the air just to see how they come down again, only to be caught, and returned to the air.<br />This is a book that will not allow you to sit still.  Children will catch the excitement of poetry as well.  May they run with it and have a blast!	2002-04-12
