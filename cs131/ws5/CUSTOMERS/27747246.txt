For crying out loud folks, read Acts 10.<br /><br />About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. Then a voice told him, \\"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\\" \\"Surely not, Lord!\\" Peter replied. \\"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\\" The voice spoke to him a second time, \\"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\\" This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.	2004-08-09

It is great fun and teaches him about things that float and also about rhyming words. <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewer however, that this would not be a good book for a little baby who is putting things in his mouth.  But for older children, it is perfect.  I am going to see if there are more of these in the Baby Einstein collection.	2004-07-22

This book covers how easily scorpions can make their escape and describes how to safely house them.  As a mother that is my main concern.<br />I was pleased at how well the safety issues are covered in this area and we have been using this book to discuss with our son the importance of proper care and housing of a creature like this BEFORE he even buys one.	2004-06-09

Since our sons LOVE trains and the story of Casey Jones, we were all looking forward to reading it.<br />Unfortunately, after a good beginning, and in spite of some excellent artwork, it descends into a bizarre story about the trumpet of Gabriel.<br />It IS a folk tale.

It tells a sweet story about how a family is supported by friends and family after they lose their house to a fire.  It also shows how the family works together to save up for a chair so the mother, who works as a waitress to support them, can have a comfortable place to sit.<br />I give it 4 stars only because my son did not care for it.  I can only assume it is because none of the characters were boys and, it's really not a \\"boy\\" story, I suppose.  He may also have had a difficult time relating to the whole idea of single parenthood.  This is a rather foreign thing to him.	2004-05-08

The most horribly written section (if I had to choose one) is on sports signs.  The instructions claim that \\"Each sign clearly demonstrates its sport.\\"  To whom I have no idea.  Maybe a few of the signs were obvious but the rest were extremely confusing.  My husband, who is a genius, could not figure some of them out.<br />If you have an older child who is learning SEE this might be an ok book but if you are truly working with a beginner, this will only frustrate you.	2004-05-08

On that line of thought...none of the Christian martyr's throughout the ages needed to die such horrible and torturous deaths.<br />Christians in the middle east and in China are suffering only because they cannot get their hands on this &quot;wisdom&quot; espoused by Wilkinson.<br />We can also cut out Christ's words from the bible, much in the same way Thomas Jefferson cut out the miracles from the bible.  There is no need to read about how He came to bring the sword and not peace (Matt. 10:34-36) or how the Son of Man has no place to lie his head (Matt. 8:20).<br />Carried to it's logical conclusion, it commits the ultimate blasphemy...Christ needn't die...if only our Lord had the wisdom of Bruce Wilkinson.  What a pity.<br />But, praise be, Bruce Wilkinson can help us, by this prayer usher in that hope that is promised in Rev. 21:4 and we will suffer no more.<br />Please, people, all joking aside, read your bibles.  Start with 1 John 4 then read Matt. 7:15 and Acts 20:29.  Maybe, just maybe, your eyes will be open to the false teaching that is in these pages.	2004-05-03

That is what we are here on earth for.  It took our faithful forefathers 2 lines to say what we are here for, it takes people in our generation entire books and they still don't get it right.<br />The annoying thing about Mr. Warren's book and all others like it is they focus far too much on ourselves and far too little on God.  Even the title is self-focussed.  The Christian ought never be self focussed but God focussed.  It's not about us, it's about Him.<br />Instead, full of their own self-worth, the masses flock to these types of books and the seminars and studies they inevitably spawn.  But, if this is so effective, then why do they continue to search for more books and seminars and studies to tell them what their purpose is?<br />I suggest, instead, that you read the Heidelberg Catechism or the Westminster Catechism.  You will find rather quickly what you were put on earth to do and then you can get on with living your life with the gratitude towards Christ's work that Christians are supposed to have.	2004-04-05

The \\"adventures\\" they have are told in such a way that the children can imagine themselves taking part in them.<br />In this particular story Billy sets off to find a \\"lost\\" quarry.  This one reminded me of many of the \\"adventures\\" my brother and I had as children in the forests near our grandparents farm in Montana.<br />It is nice to share a quiet, interesting story with my son.  Most authors today seem to think they need to compete with television and movies, therefore their books seem to be nothing more than written out tv shows and action flicks.<br />The other thing my son and I enjoy in these books are the drawings.  They are very good and realistic.  We have the oppotunity to study some nice art while reading a pleasant book.	2004-03-25

I know it is only a book for toddlers but shouldn't we respect their ability to comprehend and learn, however small we may think it is?<br />In this book, Julius' mother tells him not to eat the cupcakes.  Great!  So he thinks he'll count the candy corn.  Well, after counting to one, there are no more numbers.  So you can't really call it a counting book.<br />Aside from \\"counting\\" the candy corn, Julius eats all the candy corn.  This is later justified by inferring, \\"At least he didn't eat the cupcakes.\\"  There is no retribution for his eating the candy corn.  None of his friends are disappointed that they do not get a candy corn on their cupcake.  His mother does not scold him for his malfeasance.  So you can't really call it a morality tale.<br />Education and morality are pretty much the cornerstone of any good children's book.  Therefore my conclusion that there is no purpose to this book.<br />But it may be encouraging to those who would like to get into children's publishing to know that even this sort of dribble is considered publishable.<br />I am a bibliophile, but this book is getting tossed.	2004-03-11

It was on the recommended reading list for the art program my son is using for homeschool and it was the only book on the list that was for his age/grade.  I assumed it was just another reading book, so I was surprised, albeit pleasantly, when it arrived and I found it to have so many wonderful ideas and suggestions and projects inside.<br />As I read the book I find that she definitely knows children.  The way she describes the ages of my boys is just about exactly where they are.<br />She encourages &quot;free art&quot; which is a great boost for my morale.  I have always felt that children should be free to draw and paint and do art in anyway they see fit (although I am not as strict as she in regards to coloring books).  My older relatives have tried unsuccessfully to &quot;teach&quot; my oldest son to do things their way and have not only failed, but created a tension between themselves and him.<br />I highly recommend this book.
