The essays inform readers of some of the injustices in our society, tell how these injustices were battled and analyze the success or failure of the efforts.  A wide range of issues are covered-immigrant unions to school curriculums, police brutality to the internment of Haitians at Guantanamo Bay.  This book is honest and does not disguise the difficulty of struggles for dignity, but is ultimately hopeful-positive change can occur.	2005-06-17

He does not gloss over the difficult bits of travel-the fatigue, the stomach upsets, loneliness.  I also admire how he did not gloss over his own personal faults.  The graphics help to immerse the reader in his experiences-sometimes they did feel claustrophobic other times they were more exhuberant. Recommended to anyone interested in travel and anyone interested in the world of comics and graphic novels.	2005-06-17

The book also deals with hard choices-will she stay in Iran with her family, or return to the West where there is more personal freedom?  The author captures the awkwardness and soul searching of the teen and early adulthood years.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-06-17

The answer to the riddle is revealed on the right hand side of the following page with a drawing of the animal and the name of the animal in small red letters underneath the Chinese translation. The illustrations are in black and white and done in a soft, detailed style. Kids will enjoy trying to solve the riddles to discover the identity of the animals.	2005-06-17

Ug is constantly wanting more out of his life-softer trousers, a warm place to live, etc.  Ug's insatiable curiousity drives his parents crazy, but his dad tries to encourage Ug.  The book is funny and wistful at the same time.  The ending is thought-provoking and a bit melancholy-what has Ug achieved in the end?	2005-06-17

The layout of the text gives the story more power and immediacy.  The points of view change quickly from one character to the next.  This book could be used as a springboard for some interesting discussions about duty, race, love, appearances, suicide, etc.  A short read, but highly recommended.	2005-06-17

Brenda Shoshanna does not give easy answers, but instead invites the reader to struggle to find their own way.  I agree with another reviewer who wrote that truly following the recommendations and doing the exercises requires courage.  This book reminded me of Gary Zukav's books as well as Quaker spirituality. I recommend this book to anyone who feels trapped, or is curious about Zen, interested in spirituality, or wants a new perspective on life.	2005-05-19

I could identify with the characters in the book and liked the message that while most people are a little crazy they should still make the effort to function in the \\"real world\\" and fight for their freedom.  I'm not going to give it 5 stars because Coelho's writing is not strong.	2005-04-26

It is too long and could have benefited from tighter editing.  The characters could have been more fleshed out also.  The message that the rainforests and its peoples should be protected is a good one, but sometimes the book felt cliched.	2005-04-23

Montgomery's portrayal of Valency's family and small town society in the early 20th century is very funny.  The ending is a bit too perfect, but that is its charm.  Reading the book makes me want to take a trip into the wilderness.  If you want a sweet, funny book to curl up with, this is a good choice.	2005-04-23

I agree the ending did feel a bit rushed and that it would have been nice to have more of Quintin's perspective in the last part of the book.  This book does bring up questions of truth and perspective.  Some events were a bit ambiguous, but that was the point.  I'm most conflicted about Quintin-was he really responsible for so much violence?  At first I wanted to believe he was a regular out of touch middle-aged man, but by the end I thought of him more as a monster.  Why didn't Isabel speak out more against the fragmentation of her family?	2005-04-23

The goal of the book was to create a darker retelling of the Snow White tale.  I thought the characters were completely unsympathetic, which is why I disliked it so much.  If the characters were more lively maybe it could be better.  For all of the violence and sex the book was strangely apathetic.  Well, I now know dark fantasy is not for me.	2005-04-23

The characters are well-written, complex, and sympathetic.  The wisdom of the book's narrator is one of the books best features-even though that wisdom was hard won.  She, and nearly every character in the book, must figure out how to go on and continue loving family members when terrible truths surface. Every family can relate to the need for forgiveness, love,healing.  The book is a realistic love story.	2005-04-23

As other reviewers mentioned, the main issues of the book are still relevant today.  The female characters aren't that great.  One is the stereotypical virtuous 19th century woman who is basically a doormat-she gets a bit tiresome.  The male characters were more sympathetic.  One of the best parts of the book is seeing how some characters evolve and some do not.  The book does take a while to get through, but it is worth the effort.	2005-04-23

It begins when Mary (called Miriam in the book) is ten years old and ends when she is about to meet Jesus (Joshua).  The book portrays Miriam as a young woman who struggles against the hypocrisies of her society and especially against the restrictions against women (women aren't supposed to leave the home, for example or sing in synagogue).  I enjoyed the book but wondered about its historical accuracy-especially about Miriam's struggle against the expectations for women.  Some of her thoughts and actions seemed too modern.  I think that teenage girls will be able to identify with some of Miriam's struggles.  Miriam gets into trouble just for being the person she is-she doesn't purposefully always go searching for trouble.	2005-04-23

I thought she was weak and whiny.  Ah Heng Cheh and her god are fascinating-best part of the book.  The book did keep me reading 'til the end-I kept hoping it would get better.  The fire at the end of the book left me with some questions-was Vincent responsible?  The book doesn't clearly say.	2005-04-23

US	44368823	R1VT73URRUALPY	0141302313	591413944	Fast Talk on a Slow Track	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Ok	The book is about Denzel, an African-American high school senior in Brooklyn, NY.  Denzel gets accepted to Princeton and goes for a six-week course in the summer for students who have a lot of potential but who may need some help to be able to compete with students from more privileged backgrounds.  Denzel finds he can't slide through the program like he slid through high school which causes him to reconsider his future.  <br /> <br /> This book deals very honestly with issues such as racism and class.  I enjoyed the fact that the book takes place in Brooklyn, NY because I spent this past summer there and really loved my time there.  I did not like this book much because I thought that Denzel was too cocky and cold-hearted.  I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to kids or not-maybe to kids that are similar to Denzel and come from a similar background.  It may also be valuable to show kids from the Midwest and the suburbs what life is like for a minority from an urban background.	2005-04-23

One day his mother abandons him and Matthew is left in Pusan to fend for himself.  The story shows how interracial children in Korea faced a lot of discrimination.  I was unaware of this issue.

More new characters are introduced, and more things are being set up for the next book.  It is hard to keep everyone's names and backgrounds straight too, outside of the central characters.  I couldn't read it the first time I started, but once I stopped caring a bit about what should happen I enjoyed it a bit more. This series will probably go on forever.

One of the main story lines in the book is the main character, Linda, helping one of the boys at her high school so as to be the valdictorian of his class over another boy who happens to be Japanese.  There are some parts of the book that are terribly racist-America for Americans and preserving it from the &quot;red communists&quot; the &quot;yellow Japs&quot;, the &quot;treachery of the Mexicans&quot; and the &quot;slowly uprising might of the black man&quot;.   The rest of the book is ok-a girl's struggle to do the work she was meant to do and getting her fair inheritance from her selfish sister.  I am halfway through this book, but i don't know if I will continue.  It is tragic that the author of The girl of the Limberlost descended to such a level-fear based propaganda.	2001-04-14
