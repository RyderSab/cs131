Soon he becomes caught up in the comings and goings of two lovers with a world of class differences between them.  Yet he still manages to retain his innocence, a situation author L. P. Hartley makes completely believable.  Hartly pulls off the enviable trick of making Leo three-dimensional and fully fleshed-out despite his youth and his obtuseness.  This ability to be unruffled by the passions around him is employed as a devastating counterpoint to the emotional implosion that rocks the family when the lovers are exposed.  <br /> <br />My only real complaint with the book was the introduction of Leo as a grown man towards the end.  It felt tacked on, and as though the book would have been better without it--as a sort of fever dream, beautifully written and left alone to stand on its own without the hard addition of reality and adulthood.	2005-10-05

She's done a great job of collecting pieces from the beginning of the 20th century--Dorothy Parker's quaintly flapperish \\"You Were Perfectly Fine\\" launches the volume--to the hard-knocks modern-day writing of Charles Bukowski.   <br /> <br />Funniest among these--and most of them are indeed funny--is the late, great Spalding Grey's \\"College Girls.\\"  All his inhibitions, all his fears, all his trepidation comes across loud and clear in this recounting of his fumblings--some successful, some not--with college girls of his acquaintance.  Don Marquis writes elegantly of the sundry subtle skills of rolling and then smoking a cigarette; Mary McCarthy addresses loss of virginity with an excerpt from her classic novel \\"The Group;\\" Corey Ford recounts an office party gone hellishly, hilariously wrong with alcohol; and Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg write the strangest piece of all, about an attractive woman irresistibly drawn to a homeless hunchback. <br /> <br />The range of human experience, as seen through our predilection for things that feel good but might not be so good for us, is laid bare here--pun intended--and it makes for a wonderful afternoon's reading.	2005-04-12

Some of the essays are terrific.  Then there are those that are eye-rollingly just, well, too much.  Toure's \\"An Invitation to Carnal Russian Roulette\\" reads like something a fourteen-year old boy would write about what he figures it's like to have relations with several different women.  It may be truthful--I have no reason to doubt that it is--but the prose is awfully purple.      But back to the terrific pieces.  Steve Friedman writes touchingly and with a little bit of wonder at the fact that he's 47 years old, heterosexual and unmarried.  He's willing to probe all the probable causes, even at the risk of being uncomfortably honest about himself.  Fred Leebron's \\"I am Man, Hear Me Bleat\\" is hilarious, but not without an underlying resentment--which makes it all the more hilarious.  Daniel Jones' own \\"Chivalry on Ice\\" addresses the fact of his wife's incredible strength and independence and her simultaneous inability to deal with bugs.  Rob Jackson's \\"My Life as a Housewife\\" addresses the fascinating topic of the househusband, and may be the most skillful piece in terms of combining the modern man's wish to be, well, modern--with all the helpfulness and honesty and rejection of sexist role models that implies--with his feeling that maybe, just maybe, he is missing out on the standard male experience.    It's a great read, and a wide-ranging scope of topics.  I look forward to Jones and Hanauer doing some kind of dual follow-up with actual couples--married or not, heterosexual or not--addressing a new range of issues in some future volume.	2005-04-12

Among these are the Lizzie Borden Bed & Breakfast; museums devoted variously to dirt, barbed wire, and feet; a hotel which makes a tremendous show of its resident ducks getting into and out of water; a tour of Parisian sewers; a funeral home miniature golf course; and, of course, Graceland.  Peters is unfailingly sarcastic, which makes for terrific reading since his hosts are generally unfailingly sincere and enthusiastic about their chosen oddity. <br /> <br />One of the chapters is entitled \\"The Old Woman with an Armchair Glued to Her Ass.\\"  The subtitles on this chapter alone include: \\"Mr. Moussef asks for a fork - Joseph, Mary, and the teddy-bear Jesus - a touch of unpleasantness in a Boston library - a sticky breakfast confrontation.\\"  So you can imagine what the rest of the text is like . . . well, heck, here are just a very few highlights: <br /> <br />\\"In 1773, the British Parliament passed a wicked piece of legislation called The Tea Act, imposing a tax on all tea imported into the Colonies.  The locals were in an uproar.  'Ye infernal bounders! Forsooth, 'tis intolerable what ye do'; or however they spoke back then.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Boston Common is the oldest park in America.  In fact, I think it may even date as far back as Historical Times.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Nobody in Salem [Massachusetts] is able to mention the witch trials, not even in passing, without also telling you the date of them--1692.  It's fun to begin with, and then you wish they'd stop.\\" <br /> <br />On slogans for cities: \\"Salem's is 'The Bewitching Seaport,' which isn't bad.  There's also Minneapolis: 'The Coolest Place on Earth' (though, having been there, I realize that this is more of a stern warning than a slogan); Albuquerque: 'It's a Trip!' and of course Boston's slogan: 'How DARE you Come Here!' \\" <br /> <br />A sample conversation with a drama student dressed in historically accurate clothes: <br /> <br />ME: Excuse me, which way to the bathroom? <br />STUDENT: Insolent coxswain!  Begone, knave, lest I begroddle thy swank with my jerkin. <br /> <br />The footnotes alone are a scream, so you can imagine what the actual text is like.  HIGHLY recommended for anyone who loves to travel and enjoys a good (read: bad) travel story.	2005-04-12

Everyone from Annie Proulx to Jamaica Kincaid to E. L. Doctorow to the late Saul Bellow approaches the act of writing differently, and each has different thoughts to offer.  Some of the essays are funny, some are quietly sad, and still others address the dual difficulty and delight of turning out something new and yet universal. <br /> <br />The breadth of thought is amazing, but each of the essays is skillful and thought-provoking.  Perhaps my favorite was by Alice Hoffman, who writes, \\"I wrote to find beauty and purpose, to know that love is possible and lasting and real, to see daylilies and swimming pools, loyalty and devotion, even though my eyes were closed and all that surrounded me was a dark room.  I wrote because that was who I was at the core, and if I was too damaged to walk around the block, I was lucky all the same.  Once I got to my desk, once I started writing, I still believed anything was possible.\\"   <br /> <br />In this short passage, she speaks for all the writers here, in saying that writing is a need, not a desire, and that the act is without boundaries and filled with possibility.  This is a useful and enriching book for writers, and for those who are simply curious about how writers do what they do.	2005-04-12

Her several positions are described with deadly accuracy--the bratty children, the yapping dogs, the secretly disdainful other servants, the uninvolved parents.  All are rendered here in minute and telling detail.   <br /> <br />Agnes's familial background--and the familial background of Anne Bronte, of course--makes her especially well-suited to describing a local cleric she dislikes: \\"His favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and ceremonies, apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and obedience to the clergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent, the absolute necessity of observing all the forms of godliness, the reprehensible presumption of individuals who attempted to think for themselves in matters connected with religion, or to be guided by their own interpretations of Scripture, and occasionally (to please his wealthy parishioners), the necessity of deferential obedience from the poor to the rich--supporting his maxims and exhortations throughout with quotations from the Fathers . . . But now and then he gave us a sermon of a different order--what some would call a very good one; but sunless and severe: representing the Deity as a terrible taskmaster, rather than a benevolent father . . . [on leaving the church, I heard] his voice in jocund colloquy with some of the Melthams or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrays themselves; probably laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he had given the rascally people something to think about; perchance, exulting in the thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay aside the sinful indulgence of her pipe, which had been her daily solace for upwards of  thirty years; the George Higgins would be frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks, and Thomas Jackson would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken in his sure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day.\\" <br /> <br />Bronte displays this same calm, measured, extraordinarily accurate descriptive skill throughout the novel, which more than makes up for the fact that the plot is simple and the action mostly calm and uneventful.  The joys of the book lie chiefly in seeing how Bronte renders even the simplest character vividly lifelike.	2005-04-04

The other is their talent for observing--with only a little smidgen of a judgmental attitude--the foibles and hobbies of the wealthy and the social climbers of their particular world (specifically, Manhattan in the 1930s through the 1950s).   <br /> <br />In THE ROSE GARDEN, Brennan--an abundantly talented Irish native who spent many years living and writing in New York--examines most particularly the social comings and goings of the residents of a neighborhood closely modeled on Sneden's Landing, the clubby, cloistered, wealthy weekend getaway for many Manhattanites.  Brennan repeats characters freely from story to story, which lends the book a richness it might not otherwise have, and she skewers with extraordinary precision and delicacy the foolishness her characters indulge in--knowingly sometimes, but mostly in complete oblivion to their idiocies. <br /> <br />Special treats in THE ROSE GARDEN include \\"The Divine Fireplace\\" (which features possibly the funniest conversation I've ever read between a wife and a woman she sees as a threat to her marriage); \\"The Stone Hot Water Bottle\\" and \\"The Servants' Dance,\\" which brings into sharp focus the \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" observations at which she excels.  These stories are deliciously readable--and re-readable.	2005-03-08

That's the micro story.  The macro story is that of the beginnings of the Mormon faith, with all its ups and downs, and it is absolutely fascinating.  Whether or not you agree with the tenets of the Mormon church, the story itself is absorbing and richly detailed.   <br /> <br />The family the story focuses on--the Laffertys--becomes involved in a terrible crime.  I don't want to say more for fear of giving away too much detail to those who haven't read the book. While Krakauer stays away from overemphasizing the gory details, he conveys the horrific nature of it enough to shock the reader.   <br /> <br />Some of the family members are sketched in finely drawn detail, but others--including a main character named Allen--are so lacking in detail and nuance as to be almost unknowable.  This is really the only problem with the book from a readability perspective.  Otherwise, it's a sad but fascinating account of what can happen when religious leanings tip over the edge into fanaticism.	2005-03-08

This effect is all the more chilling when that world starts to implode.   <br /> <br />A diptheria epidemic--something virtually unknown in modern times--is stealthily, then openly, decimating a small Wisconsin town.  Jacob Hansen, who serves as a combination sheriff, undertaker and minister, is doing his level best to deal with his combination of duties in the face of the epidemic.  He is a strong and silent type, a Civil War veteran, and he does what has to be done as many of the townspeople are stricken.  By the time O'Nan reveals the subtle, horrifying breadth of the epidemic, he had me so involved that it nearly took my breath away.   <br /> <br />This is an outstandingly fine novel--elegantly made, profound in its implications, and still reverberating in my mind weeks after I finished it.	2005-03-08

After having trained and worked in textile art in Scandinavia, Sargent brought her bold, free-wheeling color and pattern sensibility back to the United States, where it has had a considerable impact on modern country decorating.  Once the province of dove greys, white, taupe and beige, the boundaries of country decorating have been pushed out by Sargent, who is interested in helping us not be afraid of pattern and color--and in fact, she urges us to embrace both.<br />The book is an exhilarating visual punch.  Sargent blithely combines acid green, periwinkle, daffodil, a deep coral red and a host of other colors to show us that--far from being intrusive or hard to live with on a day-to-day basis<BR>--color can be simultaneously stimulating and calming.  <br />The practical advice in here isn't anything you haven't read elsewhere already, but the book is worth the price just to see Sargent's heady color experiments and her considerable control of pattern as well.	2003-10-14

Bearing this in mind, you will find this both immensely enjoyable and hauntingly well-written.<br />O'Toole's recollections of his parents--a gorgeous, flirtatious mother and a handsome, ne'er-do-well father--are rich with detail and emotion.  He remembers also their friends, their tribulations (and pet mouse!) during WWII, and perhaps most vividly of all, his enforced sojourn in the English countryside when city life was deemed too dangerous for children.  His account of going to church and going to a Protestant school (O'Toole was reared a good Irish Catholic boy) are especially hilarious, from the fights with bullies to the strict teachers to the sad family with whom he lodged.  One especially funny tale has to do with a school picnic.  When the Protestant teacher instructs the class to pray for good weather for the picnic, they all promise to.  Of course picnic day arrives and is rainy.  The teacher disapprovingly sniffs, \\"Well, I see God didn't answer our prayers.\\"  O'Toole, eight years old and astounded by this non-Catholic outlook, cries out, \\"Yes, He did!  He said no!\\"<br />Young O'Toole is obsessed with Adolf Hitler, who makes an appearance every several dozen pages.  O'Toole gets at the maniacal dictator's fascination for a young, feverishly imaginative boy with some extraordinary stream-of-consciousness writing:<br />\\"Hitler had been poison-gassed [in WWI].  Daring despatch runner that he was, twice he was got.  Shrapnel swept a bit of his shin away.  After two years of carnage, fighting trench warfare at the front, he was got.  Into beetroot fields. stream bottoms, slag heaps, pitheads, broken smoking juts of towns and villages, burning vanished woodlands, into downs and rides and hillsides, the trenches had been dug deep down into the mud and earth . . . hydra-headed, destroyed, constantly relocated, these barbarous earthworks moved and split the countrysides of France and Belgium.  Six million soldiers hopped off sandbag parapets and were killed.  Many miles of no man's lands ran between the Allied and the German trenchlines, they, too, dying and being reborn in other fields.  Barbed-wire gardens to crouch in and be killed.\\"<br />If only the book explored more of O'Toole's life as a world-renowned actor . . . but it doesn't.  It stops shortly after the war and we must all hope that he soon writes a follow-up volume.  Had he not been an actor, Peter O'Toole could have made a splendid career as a writer.  Thoroughly enjoyable!	2003-10-14

He covers every continent (with special attention paid to the Brits and the Americans, who both have an enormous national sweet tooth) and every conceivable type of candy, from milk- and cream-based confections to those which have their foundations in nuts and fruits to those commonly enrobed in chocolate and beyond.<br />There is apparently nothing which cannot be made somehow into a sweet.  Richardson reports that in India, &quot;sherbet&quot; is made from ground-up chickpea powder, sugar and baking soda.  The Maoris, in the early part of the 19th century, commonly ate fern root &quot;moistened with treacly brown sugar crystals from the pith of the . . . cabbage palm&quot; and the Turks, known throughout the civilized world for the sheer breadth of their confectionary offerings, make pastries and nutmeats with the most fabulous names: lady's navel, glad eyes and sweetheart lips are but among a few.<br />Along the way, Richardson never fails to fascinate and inform. He tells us that writer Roald Dahl was told in childhood that licorice whips were made from rats' blood, tying this into other candy myths like the 1970s-era one about Bubble Yum being filled with spider eggs.  Richardson has even managed to unearth some true-life horrific candies, such as &quot;Kelly-in-a-Coffin,&quot; a popular 19th century sweet molded like, well, a baby in a coffin (more acceptable, apparently, when infant mortality was a more everyday part of life).<br />Despite the occasional unnecessary pomp (Richardson is overly fond of referring to himself in print as &quot;The First International Confectionary Historian&quot;), this sweet book is a special treat for anyone interested in either candy or history--or both!	2003-10-14

James Murray, editor of the then-in-progress &quot;Oxford English Dictionary,&quot; finds out that Dr. W. C. Minor, one of his steadiest and most brilliant contributors, is not what he seems.  <br />This astonishing discovery, with all its attendant ramifications, is played out against a backdrop of the American Civil War, Victorian England, the English urge to be best at whatever is attempted, late 19th-century attitudes about mental illness and more.  Murray is portrayed as serious from the start about education and learning--this is a boy who by the age of fifteen had a working knowledge of French, Italian, German and Greek and who inscribed on the flyleaf of his primer, &quot;KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.&quot;  Though the other main character, Dr. W. C. Minor, would at first appear to be similar in many ways to Murray--well brought-up, brilliant, slightly eccentric--the similarities end there.  Minor had the misfortune to serve as a medic in the Civil War, a time when, according to Winchester, &quot;The common soldier was thus in a poorer position than at any time before: he could be monstrously ill treated by all the new weaponry, and yet only moderately well treated with all the old medicine.&quot;  Minor's mental collapse begins here, on the bloodied American battlefields, and continues once he departs for England.<br />In addition to the human drama at work here, we are shown the history of dictionaries for English-speakers.  It is a fascinating journey.  Samuel Johnson apparently wrote a terrific dictionary--one of the first really complete ones--but even this fine effort was marred by Johnson's inability to resist inserting his own viewpoints in the definitions (for &quot;oats&quot; Johnson wrote, &quot;A grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people&quot;).  Winchester alsoexamines the fiendish difficulty of definitions themselves in the following passage: <br />&quot;Defining words properly is a fine and peculiar craft.  There are rules--a word (to take a noun as an example) must first be defined according to the class of things to which it belongs (mammal, quadruped), and then differentiated from other members of that class (bovine, female).  There must be no words in the definition that are more complicated or less likely to be known than the word being defined.  The definition must say what something is, and not what it is not . . . If the definer contrives to follow all these rules, stirs into the mix an ever-pressing need for concision and elegance--and if he or she is true to the task, a proper definition will probably result.&quot;<br />&quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; is a heady mix of history, drama, mystery, thriller and truth--whatever that truly means, however it be defined--and I highly recommend it.	2003-09-03

Travel books have never, ever interested me--when I hear that one is particularly good, I tend to think, \\"Yeah, that was THEIR experience, but there's no way it can translate . . . \\"  My thinking has always been that you yourself have to be somewhere, live somewhere, to really know what it's like or else what's the point?<br />My views on this changed when my sister gave me a copy of Leila Hadley's extraordinary \\"Give Me the World.\\"  A travel book in name only, this work by a great-great-great-great-granddaughter of author James Boswell is more a journey of self-discovery than it is about the places she visits--but the writing is so fierce, so fine, so rich and complex, that as a travelogue it is still head and shoulders above 90% of what else is out there cluttering the travel book bookshelves.  Case in point:<br />Of trying to learn Siamese: \\"Learning to recognize such simple signs as DANGER, WOMEN and EXIT was as difficult as memorizing the patterns in filigreed silver.\\"<br />Of the Siamese attitude towards life: \\"Although Siamese, as good Buddhists, do not believe in taking life, they see nothing wrong in rescuing a fish from drowning.  If the creatures die on the bank or in a net, it is probably from exhaustion due to their long immersion, they say, and surely there can be no harm in eating them.\\"<br />Of Bangkok's reputation as a den of iniquity: \\"To make sure that one missed nothing of Bangkok's [physical] wonderland, the Siamese had thoughtfully provided a 'Baedeker' . . . in the preface [it noted], 'This pocket book is somewhat inevitable to be kept ready at the hands.' \\"<br />Of her opium den experience: \\"I thought ahead to the times when, back in New York, I would say, 'By the way, I once had an interesting experience in an opium den' or even, 'Opium? Why, of course, I smoked it in Bangkok.' \\"<br />Of the difference between western and Malayan clothing: \\" . . . the people not in western costume looked out of place and a little garish, like partygoers in evening clothes coming home at breakfast time.\\"<br />Of cooking on board a small boat: \\" . . . breakfast was a tempestuous affair.  Vic darted about the lounge scaling coffee mugs at us, swearing at the stove, in a pother that the biscuits were burned on the bottom and raw on top, rattling and banging pans, and all the while keeping up a running flow of conversation about an article one of the men's adventure pulps had ordered him to rewrite, about the things he wanted to do--all the wildly impractical things like walking from Cairo to Morocco, chartering a dhow to explore the Baluchistan coast, leading an archaeological expedition to Alaska, and then his talk coursed off onto the subject of women and their extraordinary behavior.\\"<br />On jellyfish: \\"We were almost abreast of the muddy current when a myriad of filmy jellyfish streamed past the hull.  They were beautiful things, delicately colored--some like fragile bladders of Venetian blown glass, some like the pinky-fawn undersides of toadstools with pearly streamers.\\"<br />On steering the boat at dawn: \\"The dawn watch.  It was one of those chance rewards of travel, a magic moment, untranslatable from its time and place, a moment which lives on perpetually, with all its colors made fast.  Just then there was no sign of dawn.  The masts were still black against the luminous darkness of the sky, the sails grey in the starlight.  There was a thrilling flush of wind against my skin.\\"<br />On the Taj Mahal: \\"It shimmered.  It glowed.  It had the magical property of not looking man-made.  Its marble walls had the tender radiance of seashells, petals and moonlit snow.\\"<br />I could go on and on (and already have!), but really, you have to read the book to get more of this gorgeous prose and see a sheltered girl--yes, a girl, despite her twenty-five years and her six-year old son--blossom into a woman of the world as she makes her way around it.

It examines the situation in Gander, Newfoundland on September 11th, 2001 and the several days after.  This is when Gander residents took into their homes and hearts the thousands of stranded airplane passengers and crew who ended up in their town when all planes were ordered to land wherever they could.  <br />The book is multi-faceted with an enormous cast of characters, all of whom DeFede manages to keep both real and distinct from one another.  We hear tales of couples coming home to America from adopting abroad; big-wig businessmen finding themselves in the same plight as their less-well-known fellow passengers; the mother of a fallen firefighter waiting to find out what happened to her son as she sits nervously in Gander; and perhaps most upliftingly of all, the beginnings of love between two stranded strangers who would never have met were it not for the horrific events of that fateful day.<br />I came to tears several times throughout the book.  It is a much-needed tonic for anyone who still feels as though they can't quite get a grasp on what took place in America on September 11th.  It is a little cameo of a book--a miniature reminder that in the face of extraordinary evil, people will always rally to summon up kindness, generosity and the best of what humanity has to offer.	2003-09-03

We see everything from resilience to hate to common scents, from magic to &quot;girlness&quot; to dogs to cicadas.  <br />Among the many pleasures of the book--Barry's extremely simple yet enormously evocative illustrations, the awesome ear she has for the way children speak to each other, the cheerful colors belying much of the sadness inherent in her work--is the section entitled &quot;Magic.&quot;  This regards Barry's rejection, at age thirteen, of her two-years-younger best friend.  It's easy to tell that even more than thirty years later, Barry feels shame over this episode.  She so deftly sketches the psyche of her thirteen-year old self that we are left alternating between complete understanding of her actions and rueful sorrow that she couldn't ignore the age difference.<br />This is a funky, trippy book that's simultaneously a quick read and something you want to linger over the second (and third, and fourth) time you read it.  Long may Lynda Barry rule!	2003-07-24

Cynthia Kaplan's &quot;Why I'm Like This&quot; alternates hilarity (experiences at all-girl camp, being a waitress) with life's more sober times (putting her grandmother in a nursing home, having difficulty getting pregnant).  Because of the mood swings (for lack of a better phrase) the book undergoes, it's sometimes a bumpy and uneven ride--but whether she's being serious or poking a proverbial elbow in your ribs, Kaplan is a talented writer who's fun to read.  Some gems from the book:<br />One of the many pitfalls of working in a restaurant is that eventually you will wait on your peers.  Or people who had been your peers before they became successful bankers and you became a waiter.  First, there will be the requisite &quot;Hi!&quot; &quot;Hi!&quot; &quot;How are you!?&quot; &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; (What am I DOING? I think it's pretty clear: Good evening, my parents spent fifty thousand dollars on my education, would you like some more bread?)  After the initial pleasantries are dispensed with, you will embarrass everyone with &quot;Let me tell you about our specials.&quot;<br />* * *<br />On one of the last true blue days of August, when the oppressive midsummer haze had been blown away by some zippy cumulus clouds, opportunity knocked once more.  At the counselors' pool party, [my crush] Jamie Karlin asked me to rub sunblock onto his back.  He had the most unbelievable, fair, freckly skin.  Had I this moment to live again, I would have offered to apply the sunblock later, in private, with my tongue.<br />* * *<br />Writing about her father's love of gadgets:<br />He was one of the first people to have a phone in his car.  This was the late 1960s, decades before cellular technology, and it was essentially like having a shortwave radio in your car . . . At stoplights, my brother and I used to open the window, hold out the receiver to the driver of the car next to us, say, &quot;It's for you,&quot; and collapse in hysterics.<br />* * *<br />Kaplan coversso many different topics I can't begin to cover them all here, but every baby boomer woman I know who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s will love this book.  I even had a bathing suit like the one in which Kaplan appears on the cover--kindred spirits in more ways than one!	2003-07-24

I happened to start reading it one weekend when my husband and kids were away, and the first night finally went to bed at 3:00 AM, although I wanted to stay up and just keep reading.  I finished it the next afternoon, and it was an altogether delicious use of my time.  This is a most satisfying novel.<br />\\"The Quality of Life Report\\" is a semi-autobiographical tale of one Lucinda Trout, a Manhattan TV producer who is bogged down by doing segments on sushi, the thong underwear craze and so on.  She is disgusted by her job, her boss, her life.  After having done a piece on meth addiction in the midwestern United States, she moves there and continues to do pieces called \\"The Quality of Life Report\\" for her Manhattan TV show.<br />The move is a jolt for Lucinda, but she settled in fairly quickly.  She meets all sorts of interesting people--the book fairly teems with characters, all of whom are drawn so full-bloodedly and realistically that you feel as though you are reading about people you know yourself.  Without going into the amount of detail that would give away the book's denoument, suffice it to say that Daum doesn't stoop to the pat happy ending--and yet her ending makes perfect, delicious sense.  <br />The book is often laugh-out-loud funny.  Daum's writing is wonderful, as you can see by the samples below:<br />\\"Do you ever get, like, harassed?\\" I asked, now a probing journalist in the Katie Couric vein, unafraid of raising the tough questions.  \\"I mean, being openly gay and living out in the country and everything.\\"<br />Sue looked bewildered.  \\"No.\\"  She said this as if I had asked whether coyotes ever came near the house, opened the door, and sprawled out on the couch to watch \\"Friends.\\"<br />* * *<br />[Lucinda is having a drink with her friend Daphne and tells Daphne that she's contemplating moving to the midwest.]<br />\\"I think I might have to move there.  I think the train has left the station.  I have the idea.  I can't not do it.\\"<br />\\"Uh oh,\\" she said.  \\"Alternative Lifestyle Alert.\\"<br />When my friends and I were not discussing the lack of available men, we were usually discussing moving out of New York.  Again, the subjects were related, though not entirely.  Someone was always coming up with an escape plan, a way to lower the cost of living, a way to increase the odds of meeting a guy who actually knew how to hammer a nail into a piece of plywood.  The plans varied according to the books we'd recently read, the movies we'd recently seen, the city most recently featured on \\"The Real World.\\"  We'd say Austin, Seattle, Paris, New Delhi.  When somebody came home from an unusual location--a wedding in Nova Scotia or a snorkeling trip in Australia--and spent two weeks obsessing about moving into a yurt on the Bay of Fundy we called it an Alternative Lifestyle Alert.  The guiding principle of the Alternative Lifestyle Alert was that it was never acted upon.<br />* * *<br />Daum especially hits the nail precisely on the head when she describes the different way the midwest feels to Lucinda:<br />But descending into Prairie City had a way of making me feel that there was virtually no chance of crashing.  There was so much space, so many miles of flat, open fields that landing a plane seemed less a matter of hitting a target than of simply getting close enough.  <br />In New York, this had not been the case.  At LaGuardia, the smallest error--an extra few degrees of bank to the right, a misheard syllable from a rapid-fire controller--would land you in Flushing Bay.  The same principle applied down on the ground.  There, the margin for error was so small it was hardly there at all.  In New York, you looked to the left and the right and back again, your head spinning from fear and indecision.  The wrong college, the wrong job, the wrong direction on the A train could overturn you.  We were so careful in the city.  We checked ourselves at every corner.  Wewere careful whom we lent things to, whom we invited inside, whom we fell in love with.  Like planes stacked up over the airports, we didn't make a move until we knew we were cleared.  We dated for years before risking cohabitation.  We didn't marry until we were sure we couldn't do better.  We didn't have children until it was almost too late.  To act sooner, to not agonize over every option until they all practically lost their appeal, would have been to risk disaster.  We were packed so tightly and moving so rapidly that one misstep could knock us permanently off course.  We always seemed an instant away from losing everything.<br />* * *<br />Daum so perfectly describes Lucinda's awakening (of sorts) and her foibles and her meandering path that you are just amazed when you consider that this is a novel.  Such a fully realized modern female character, with such depth and breadth and the full complement of true, human contradictions!  It's a breath of fresh air.  I really can't recommend the book highly enough--it was truly a pleasure to read and I can't wait for Daum's next book.	2003-07-24

Weisman's writing is wise without being snooty, and hilarious because of the truths about which she writes.  She has nailed the experience of traveling while married dead-on, and the result is a book filled with laughs.  You'll find yourself exclaiming, &quot;That's so true!&quot;  The funniest essay in the book, &quot;Doing Nothing,&quot; explores the whole fallacy of the relaxing beach vacation:<br />&quot;Day two was always a sobering experience.  We would learn for the first, second or third season in a row that we could not read on a beach.  Too hot even for Jackie Collins.  And so, like two amphibious creatures in a PBS nature documentary, we would lie on the sand until some eternal signal as old as life itself would tell us that we had preheated to 350 and it was time to make our way to the sea.  There, we would submerge and swim about for several minutes before retracing our steps up the beach to resume our patient vigil on the sand.  After a preordained period of time, the amazing cycle of nature would begin again, and back we'd go to the sea.  And we'd do all this without ever laying eggs.&quot;<br />Weisman covers rental properties, spa vacations, whitewater rafting, cooking in other people's kitchens, inviting people to vacation with you, packing and just about every other travel topic under the sun.  The result is wonderful--highly recommended.	2003-07-24
US	47346111	RMDZU059T4FC9	0060934417	546555129	Bel Canto	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	I'm raving about this novel to everyone I know	Friends and family are getting a little bit bored by now hearing me rave about Ann Patchett's superb &quot;Bel Canto,&quot; but I can't help myself.  It's a startlingly wonderful novel built on the most unlikely premise that a terrorist plot to kidnap the president of an unnamed third world country can evolve into a thing of beauty and wonder.<br />Roxane Coss, an American opera singer, has gone to &quot;the host country&quot; (as Patchett diplomatically refers to the country which, by her description, appears to be Peru) to sing at a birthday dinner for a visiting Japanese industrialist.  The Japanese industrialist is being wined and dined so that the host country can convince him to build one of his many plants there, creating lots of jobs.  The industrialist, however, has come merely because he learns that Roxane Coss--his favorite opera singer--will be singing to honor him on his birthday.  He has no intention whatsoever of building a plant in this country and has jetted here only to be in the same room with Coss and drink in her extraordinary singing.<br />When terrorists burst into the room and take everyone hostage (quickly releasing all the women with the exception of Coss), everything--of course--changes.  Diplomats and bureaucrats from dozens of different countries begin to live together as hostages, employing the extraordinary linguistic talents of Gen, the industrialist's translator.  Gen becomes privy to everything, as he must communicate for everyone--even the terrorists.<br />Patchett deftly and memorably sketches the characteristics and proclivities of about a dozen major characters in the book.  She shows us how everything has changed for the hostages--theoretically, very much for the worse--and yet how even in an unimaginably difficult situation, people can still find beauty and love and honor.  The characters leap from the page, full-blooded and full of life.  Yet as they forge new alliances and discover each other's foibles and virtues, we know that the clock is inexorably ticking, ticking, ticking towards a time when everything will change again--as suddenly, and as violently, as it all began.  This is an extraordinary piece of work, and I was really and truly sad when the book ended.	2003-07-11

It is, instead, the ultimately lonely tale of a woman demanding the same attention and right to pleasures of all kinds that she enjoyed in her youth.  It is a fascinating story, not least because Juska bares herself emotionally--so willingly does she do so, in fact, that the reader is sometimes compelled to look away.  It is an astonishingly honest, forthright account of one woman's campaign to keep a sex life.<br />Juska starts with a \\"New York Times Review of Books\\" personal ad, counting her dollars and trying to make every word count.  She examines with fascination the differences between ads placed by men and those placed by women: \\"Somewhere I read that personal ads projected what the writers of them would like to be, not what they were: men's ads included the out-of-doors; women's, fireside coziness.  It seemed to me that men wanted a way out, women a way in.\\"<br />The ad having been placed, Juska takes us on a whirlwind ride of dividing the ad's answers into yes, no and maybe piles; meeting different men; having dinner, conversation and yes, sex with some of the men.  Beyond this, she makes the book an autobiography, talking a great deal about her growing-up years in Archbold, Ohio, about being (briefly) a wife and (forever) a mother, about teaching in high school, in college and in prison.  We sense the loneliness our older years can bring, while seeing in her (mostly) bright attitude and her willingness to put herself on the line that anyone--anyone!--can go after something they want.  We see that age does not protect us from yearning, from occasional foolishness, from selfishness and from making the same mistake more than once.  It's a freeing and wonderful story, wonderfully told.	2003-06-26

LeFanu, despite fame in Victorian times, has mostly fallen off the radar of modern readers.  His superlative \\"Uncle Silas\\" is clear evidence as to why anyone who loves a good yarn will be immediately drawn in by his considerable gifts.  This novel has a well-modulated dark atmosphere, clearly drawn and fully human characters and a superb plot.<br />The titular Silas is the uncle of our heroine Maud Ruthyn, who becomes the ward of her mysterious uncle upon her father's death.  Silas has an unsavory reputation, having once been accused of murdering a man to whom he owed a gambling debt, but he has, by the time Maud first meets him, apparently repented and found religion.  She goes to his home willingly, quickly befriends his saucy daughter Milly and is, for the most part, happy in her new surroundings.  The plot thickens from there, and without giving away important details, the reader should know that LeFanu lets loose with a ripping good story that ends most satisfactorily and with some wonderful twists.<br />LeFanu is a skilled writer at the apex of his powers and an astute observer of the human condition.  Some of the more telling lines exhibiting his gifts include:<br />\\" . . . that lady has a certain spirit of opposition within her, and to disclose a small wish of any sort was generally, if it lay in her power, to prevent its accomplishment.\\"<br />\\"Already I was sorry to lose him.  So soon we begin to make a property of what pleases us.\\"<br />\\"People grow to be friends by liking, Madame, and liking comes of itself, not by bargain.\\"<br />\\"She had received a note from Papa.  He had had the impudence to forgive HER for HIS impertinence.\\"<br />\\"In very early youth, we do not appreciate the restraints which act upon malignity, or know how effectually fear protects us where conscience is wanting.\\"<br />\\"One of the terrible dislocations of our habits of mind respecting the dead is that our earthly future is robbed of them, and we thrown exclusively upon retrospect.\\"<br />\\" 'The world,' he resumed after a short pause, 'has no faith in any man's conversion; it never forgets what he was, it never believes him anything better, it is an inexorable and stupid judge.' \\"<br />\\" . . . I had felt, in the whirl and horror of my mind, on the very point of submitting, just as nervous people are said to throw themselves over precipices through sheer dread of falling.\\"<br />Admirers of Wilkie Collins, Thomas Hardy and, to a lesser degree, of Charles Dickens will find much to please them in the classic \\"Uncle Silas.\\"	2003-06-26

It resounds with the echoes of people reaching out to one another--sometimes successfully, often not.  As in his other poetry volumes, both Michigan and Pennsylvania are key characters (Daniels was reared outside Detroit, and has lived in Pittsburgh for two decades).  One of the very first poems has to do with his ambivalence about the idea of his parents leaving the home he grew up in:<br />\\"Stay, I say.  I keep a few boxes<BR>in the basement--old records,<BR>magazines, books.  A little weight<BR>to hold them there so I can imagine<BR>some constant thing.\\"<br />\\"Strip\\" is an astonishing poem.  Daniels limns the awkward pas-de-deux of two people who scarcely know each other, but are both seeking physical intimacy.  The fact that they are mostly strangers is captured perfectly at the end of the poem:<br />\\" . . . She whispered<BR>in my ear, and I pulled the blankets<BR>up over us.  I knew her name,<BR>so I whispered that.\\"<br />When he moves on to marriage and family, Daniels does equally well--the images are pungent, stark in their simplicity, resonant with truth.  The poems he writes for and about his two children are especially good--true, loving, but dispassionate in observed detail.  This is a fine work of a mature and skilled American poet.	2003-02-03

Ms. Murdock approaches the subject from a fresh angle by going through the most common herbs and spices and telling the reader how these can be used or combined in common dishes--or what they most effectively enhance.  This is an excellent way to teach readers how to start building a dish from the spice or herb upward, instead of just saying, \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, throw some cinnamon into that apple pie.\\"  Instead we learn that cinnamon enhances a wide variety of dishes other than the traditional baked goods.<br />Ms. Murdock combines an encyclopedic knowledge of herbs and spices with recipes, substitutions, and a plain-speaking voice.  She even gets into common sauces (Worcestershire sauce, chutneys and the like)--themselves combinations of herbs and spices.  She tells us when to use these flavorings (at the beginning of the dish, during, or added at the end just before serving), gives advice on what herbs or spices go with the one she's talking about at the moment, and provides fascinating folklore and history.  I haven't seen this useful a cookbook in a long time and highly recommend it.	2003-01-26

We see the hatching of particularly well-known skits like the Czech \\"wild and crazy\\" brothers played by Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner and Bill Murray's loopy \\"nerds\\" couple, Belushi's Marlon Brando impression, right on up through Eddie Murphy's linguistically-challenged Buckwheat, Joe Piscopo's self-satisfied Frank Sinatra, Molly Shannon's nervy Mary Katherine Gallagher, and Julia Sweeney's beloved hermaphroditic \\"Pat.\\" <br />They're all here and then some, and while that's a lot of fun, what is almost better are the behind-the-scenes goings-on. The account of the writers dying with laughter while they write Buckwheat's rendition of Lionel Richie's \\"Three Times a Lady\\" is alone going to make most readers happy (\\"Unz, tice, fee times a nady\\" went the immortal lyrics). Writer and performer Al Franken's account of his daughter's baby shower (where he showed up with a doll, proceeded to smash the doll on the coffee table, and scared to death every guest who thought the doll was, in fact, the sleeping baby) is priceless.<br />There are sadnesses, too, harkening back to the old adage about people in pain producing the best comedy. We see in-depth the problems of John Belushi and Chris Farley, and get chills reading about the untimely demise (at his wife's hand) of the brilliant Phil Hartman.  We squirm at the unhappy tenures of both Harry Shearer and Janeane Garofalo, both of whom were a bad fit with SNL's culture (Garofalo seems still puzzled and unhappy with her experience, while Shearer has a light touch--when relating that he left for \\"creative differences,\\" he says, \\"Yeah, I was creative and they were different\\").<br />The only problem with the book--and it is rather a big one--is that Eddie Murphy refused to be interviewed for its pages. That this colossal talent's voice is missing from the book means we get only everyone else's perspective on him. It's instructive, but it would have made the book utterly complete had we had Murphy's own recollections of his 1980s stint on the show. Still, this is a wonderfully written (and judiciously edited) book.	2003-01-26

I was astonished to read that many of them couldn't even draw a straight line--they considered themselves first and foremost, for the most part, idea people and left it to underlings to actually draw the jewelry.  <br />It's fascinating to see how these ideas evolved.  Salvador Dali, interested in making hard materials seem soft and vice versa, produced some splendid jewelry which examined these paradoxes.  Harry Winston produced his first &quot;holly wreath&quot; diamond necklace after noticing that a Christmas wreath on a door combined beautifully circular, marquise, and pear shapes.  Art Deco designers like Fouquet and Sandoz were determined to incorporate materials not typically used in jewelry, and in their pursuit created astonishing pieces which used frosted crystal, wood, rubber and other unusual materials with cool assurance.<br />The only problem is that the promise of the subtitle (&quot;Great Designers, Celebrity Style&quot;) really doesn't deliver--aside from a handful of photos of Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, and Gwyneth Paltrow, we see practically nothing of the jewelry worn by celebrities.  Still, if your interest lies mainly in the designers, this is the book you want.	2003-01-26

Though there is practically no text accompanying the photographs, that's OK--this is definitely a case where a picture is worth 1,000 words (or 1,000 startled gasps!).  <br />I don't know why, but probably the first 3/4 of the book is men only--but the latter 1/4 of the book makes up for it with some of the weirdest, least flattering women's hairstyles you've ever seen in your life.  You have to wonder if these poor women were drunk when they agreed to have these crimes committed on their heads.  One of the more, um, interesting styles features a lovely model with gorgeous glossy hair--but the hair has been pulled forward to form a sort of chokehold collar around her neck, complete with Pop Art flower accessory.  Then there are the woven helmets of hair--intricate braided and twisted creations that must have taken hours to put together but which are not flattering in the least.  <br />This would make a terrific gift for your favorite hairstylist, trendoid niece or nephew, or anyone who enjoys a good snicker.

She refers to these with the charming assertion that they are \\"the DNA of desserts.\\" Although I'd disagree with her here (in my book, flour would replace almonds, much as I love almonds!), this former bakery owner makes her case so winningly and with such conviction that you are swept along in her cause.<br />The recipes are few--just under three dozen total--which may seem like very little for a cookbook that costs over twenty bucks.  But Gage isn't trying to provide you with recipes as much as she's trying to fill you in on the background, the history, the chemical properties, and the world view of these ingredients. On the task she sets for herself, she does beautifully. Did you know, for instance, that:<br />\\"The Germans have loved marzipan since it arrived in the sixteenth century from Venice. They sought out the best almonds for it, and trade guilds regulated its sale; only apothecaries were allowed to sell it, much to the chagrin of confectioners . . . Neideregger, a marzipan maker in Lübeck since 1805, still boasts two hundred varieties.\\"<br />or . . .<br />\\"The rhythmic slapping of balloon whisks beating egg whites in copper bowls is more than a romantic holdover. Atoms from the copper bind with one of the white's proteins, which promotes cross-linking between the protein molecules, resulting in a foam that is creamier and not so easy to overwhip.\\"<br />or . . .<br />\\"There is real butter, and there is fake butter, and they are not the same . . . Spurred on by a challenge from Napoleon III in 1869, Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès came up with a cheaper substitute. Relying on shaky biological knowledge of how a cow produced something that became butter, he mixed the oil from beef fat (oleo) with skimmer milk and water, throwing in a strip of cow udder for good measure. His invention was surprisingly like the veritableitem. He called it margarine, after the Greek word for 'pearl,' a name that reflected its glossy appearance. People liked the price, and some may have liked the taste. The new product became popular.\\"<br />\\"A Sweet Quartet\\" is filled with fascinating nuggets like this, studded with information that way one of Gage's desserts might be studded with dried cranberries or chocolate chunks or, well, almonds. This is a super book for anyone interested in peeking behind the bakery curtain to see the whys and wherefores of the way these essential dessert ingredients work and how they affect both each other and other ingredients. And the recipes, by the way, are wonderful!	2002-10-21

It is, to the contrary, an utterly fascinating mystery and linguistic puzzle which Robinson lays out methodically for his readers--even those who had little previous interest in linguistic puzzles.<br />Michael Ventris, the man at the heart of this book, was a rather shy, somewhat diffident man who had trained as an architect and married young.  Instead of leading the staid life it seems fate had laid out for him, he spent most of his short adult years working on the Linear B--a tablet found at a Mediterranean archaeological dig, and a tablet which had all but been pronounced indecipherable by many scholars with better credentials than Ventris's.  Ventris ignored their conclusions and did eventually decipher the tablet.  The story is filled with surprises and sudden discoveries, with disappointments and fortuitous guesses, and so on.  It is quite a ride.  There is even the occasional spot of humor--as when Ventris was stopped by a suspicious Customs agent who said, &quot;These Pylos Tablets--exactly what ailment is it that they're supposed to relieve?&quot;<br />I learned a great deal from this book.  Among the more memorable nuggets was the fact that an alphabet generally contains between 20 and 40 characters--if there are more than 40 characters, it is probably a syllabary (meaning, a system by which each character represents an entire word rather than just one letter or other element WITHIN a word).  I highly recommend this for any student of lost language--and anyone who enjoys a twisty-turny thriller!	2002-10-21

And perhaps affair is the best word to use in describing her feeling towards the jewelry which forms one of the most important private collections in the world--Taylor seems as intoxicated and bewitched by her jewelry as she ever was by true loves Mike Todd and Richard Burton (incidentally, the two husbands who gave her the most important pieces).<br />The book is an enormous treat. Sit down and feast your eyes on the rubies, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires and more which form the core of Taylor's collection. There are some misses (including an atrocious--and probably atrociously expensive--monkey necklace given to her by close friend Michael Jackson), but for the most part, the pieces shown here are beautifully designed, handsomely set, and studded with magnificent gemstones. Witness the cherry-red ruby Burton gave her one Christmas, set in a 14K gold ring and surrounded with enormous diamonds. Take a look at the famed Peregrina pearl--the finest and largest pear-shaped pearl known, and once owned by Anne Boleyn. Drool over the many diamonds (the Krupp diamond, the Taylor-Burton diamond--gosh, how DOES she keep track?!??). There are necklaces, bracelets, parures (complete sets of jewelry, from necklace to bracelet to ring to earrings and beyond), rings, and even the odd tiara and bejeweled evening purse. This is pure, unadulterated FUN and all the more so because of the clear and gleeful delight Taylor takes in her jewelry. Though she occasionally slips in a pious \\"The pieces aren't mine--I'm merely the custodian,\\" we can see that she delights in ownership. <br />\\"My Love Affair with Jewelry\\" is handsomely laid out and filled with first-hand accounts of the pieces, the occasions on which they were given (or bought, many times at auction), and the memories they evoke. The photographs of the pieces (the vast majority shown life-size) are interspersed with many never-before-seen photos of Taylor herself--sometimes with husbands, lovers, children, etc., but mostly just all by her glorious self, adorned with glorious jewelry. How fitting that the magnificent jewelry shown here should grace the person of possibly the most beautiful woman of the 20th century.	2002-10-18

Nothing against the film, which is a hoot, but the Shrek of William Steig's book is FAR lustier in his awfulness than the movie Shrek.  He absolutely REVELS in his disgusting characteristics, and ends up meeting a princess who is the ugliest, most smelly, most horrific thing he's ever seen in his life.  Naturally, he falls madly in love!  They quote monster poetry to each other:<br />Sadi Shrek, \\"Your horny warts, your rosy wens, like slimy bogs and fusty fens, thrill me.\\"<br />Said the princess, \\"Your lumpy nose, your pointy head, your wicked eyes, so livid red, just kill me.\\"<br />Was ever a romance so beautifully begun?!??  This is wonderful, wonderful stuff.  Steig absolutely revels in making these two creatures as awful as possible, and young readers (and not so young!) will enjoy the fun that Steig clearly had writing and illustrating this classic book.	2002-10-02

Jerry Scott and Jim Borgman have created, with \\"Zits,\\" a terrific comic strip.  In \\"Humongous Zits,\\" a collection of the strips, we see the day-to-day life of fifteen-year old Jeremy, whose mom is a writer and whose dad is an orthodontist.  Scott and Borgman are dead accurate when it comes to depicting the speech cadence, attitude, manner of dress, etc., of a modern American teenage boy.  Witness this conversation Jeremy has with his mother when Mom appears in the bedroom doorway with a plateful of cookies:<br />Mom: \\"Jeremy, would you and your friends like some Snickerdoodles?\\"<BR>Jeremy: \\"Feel free to embarrass me anytime, mom!\\"<BR>Mom: \\"All I did was ask if you wanted some cookies!

Gopnik details not only cultural differences between France and America (he sometimes refers to his life in Manhattan as \\"my real life\\"), but gives us a great deal about his family life in general.  Having spent a brief part of his childhood in Paris, he is in a unique position to compare his own experiences there to those being had by his son Luke, four years old at the time of the essays.<br />Gopnik has a great gift for subtle humor.  While rarely poking overt fun at Parisians, he manages to show their multi-faceted character--overly serious about some things, lighthearted about others, fairly sexist (both men and women), concerned with both surface (good looks, scarves, the right hat) and depth (Jean-Paul Sartre).	2002-10-01

The Mann Gulch Fire ended up being a turning point in the Forest Service's attitude about fires, as they learned that sometimes fires can do good by clearing an area so that new plants and trees can take root.<br />There are many nuanced layers at work here.  Most of the young smokejumpers were World War II veterans, and cocky with youth and wartime experience.  Most of their superiors had one idea about fires--put them out, no matter what.  The two attitudes together, combined with a horrific blaze, weather, dangerous slopes, and other physical problems, meant that thirteen young men died trying to do an undoable job.<br />MacLean, once a smokejumper himself, has an invaluable insider's view of the tragedy, and a natural storyteller's gift for conveying it to the reader.  It's an absorbing account of a long-ago time and young men who died just trying to do their jobs.	2002-10-01
US	47346111	R1S9VLAJPO5W2B	0679772677	303723286	A Civil Action	Books	5	6	6	N	N	An incredibly compelling AND TRUE legal thriller	Jonathan Harr's \\"A Civil Action\\" had every member of my family riveted on a cruise several years ago--the three lawyers were completely absorbed by the book, as were all the non-lawyers in the group.  Harr's great achievement here is making an legal case into a readable, understandable-by-laypeople thriller that transcends the Grisham-like limitations of the word.  It has elements of Greek tragedy--the loss of innocence (and innocents), the flawed hero, the presence of fate in everyday life.  This is an utterly compelling story, all the more so for being true.<br />Jan Schlichtmann, the main character, is a flamboyant Boston-area lawyer who has hit on the neat idea of subsidizing his nascent law firm by having the firm accept just a single case at a time.  His feeling is that he and the other lawyers will work themselves to the bone on each case, concentrating on every possible angle they can think of, in order to win big damage awards which will subsequently a) keep the bill collectors at bay and b) enhance the firm's reputation as legal bulldogs out to win at nearly any cost.  Schlichtmann's strategy works well for awhile, but when he takes on the chemical firm of W. R. Grace, he has not counted on the tenacity of their legal counsel nor the whims of the presiding judge.  The result is an absorbing, un-put-downable story of clashing egos, simple town residents who mostly just want an explanation for the inexplicable rash of childhood leukemia that's swept through their town, and ever-rising legal, personal, and professional stakes.  Schlichtmann becomes obsessed with the case:<br />\\"Nowadays Schlichtmann saw daylight only from his office window or while walking to and from a deposition.  His hair was turning gray at an alarming rate.  Kathy Boyer attributed this to stress and overwork, although it was probably more a matter of heredity.  But he had lost weight and grown pale.  His taulored suits hung from his gaunt frame and no longer looked tailored.  His hypochondria seemed to blossom under the fluorescent lights of the conference rooms.  Sometimes he'd worry about his heart, other times he'd worry about cancer.  A prolonged headache started him thinking about brain tumors.  He felt as if he were suffocating under the weight of the case . . . 'It's like one of those kiddy cars,' he said to [a friend.]  'They give you a steering wheel but it's not connected to anything.  You think you're in charge, but you're not.' \\"<br />Unfortunately, in the book as in real life, the families who brought the suit against W. R. Grace fade somewhat into the background as Schlichtmann's stake in the case grows.  Harr may not have known when he started out that Schlichtmann's outsized personality would overtake the book, but it does--and he's such an interesting and flawed character that that's not necessarily a negative thing.  Highly recommended for anyone who's interested in environmental case law or just loves a good legal read that's sobering in its many lessons.	2002-09-30

Peg Bracken's &quot;I Hate to Cook Book&quot; sure has an awful lot of good, simple recipes for a book that purports not to be about cooking.  It's fun, fun, fun to read and the recipes truly are simple and good.<br />The best thing about the book is Bracken's inimitably breezy voice.  When she tells you to stir &quot;Company Carrots&quot; until they're well-coated, she writes, &quot; . . . stirring so that all the strips get well acquainted with the sauce.&quot;  When introducing a recipe for &quot;Rosy Radish Salad,&quot; she prefaces the instructions with, &quot;This next one uses up radishes and some of your canned beans.&quot;  No doubt she's always eager to get beyond dinner because she wants to get out of the kitchen and be seated with her guests, enjoying the conversation!  She's a hoot to read, and the recipes work.  I love the recipe names: Lamb Shanks Tra-La, Elevator Lady Spice Cookies, Sour Cream Cinch No. 1 and No. 2, Philosopher's Chowder, Breakthrough Salad, Immediate Fudge Cake, Dazzleberry Tart (which begins, &quot;If the dazzleberries aren't ripe yet, use canned cherry pie filling&quot;), and more.  Even the chapter names are funny (No. 22 is entitled &quot;Stealing from Knowledgeable People&quot;).  Get this book if you enjoy cooking or hate cooking--it doesn't matter--but definitely get it if you like a good laugh and good, plain, simple recipes.	2002-09-30

After the first third of the book is devoted to technique, ingredients, and tools, the rest has yumilicious cake recipes ranging from the simple (Pound Cake) to the exotic (Piskota with Walnuts) to the just-plain-delicious (Hazelnut Macaroon Cake, Rum and Citrus Torte, Swiss Black Cherry Cake, Poppyseed and Chocolate Torte, Apricot and Pecan Tea Loaf, and Nectarine Pavlova, to name just a few).<br />As with all D-K books, the photography is a big part of the equation.

She's a wonder, and the kind of teacher every child should have at least once in their grade school career.<br />Kidder leaves no stone unturned.  We see here not only the joys and sorrows of teaching, but the accumulation of detail that leaves us feeling we understand, from the inside out, what teachers go through in order to get through to their students.  We see how \\"problem students\\" and \\"good students\\" present different challenges, how teachers and administrators deal with each other (and deal with the parents, the superintendent, and the school board), and even such mundane concerns as how to keep the class in Kleenex (they go through about twenty boxes a year).  Though the book is over a decade old, it's prescient about some things.  The majority of students in Mrs. Zajac's class are Hispanic--a growing truth throughout the United States--so along with the everyday frustrations of every teacher, we see that Mrs. Zajac has an additional workload imposed merely by the presence of a language barrier:<br />\\"Horace, are you all done?\\"<br />\\"No.\\"<br />\\"Then why are you talking to Jorge?\\"<br />She turned back around and said to Felipe and Jimmy, \\"What's the matter with you two?  The minute I turn my head, you have to talk?  What number do you carry, Jimmy?\\"<br />\\"The four.\\"<br />\\"Very good.  Got it now?  OK, Jimmy, you can go back to your desk.\\"<br />\\"Ocho,\\" said a voice behind [Mrs. Zajac], unmistakably Manny's hoarse whiskey voice.  Manny was trying to whisper to one of his buddies, but he just couldn't do it quietly.  [She] turned.  \\"Why don't you try Chinese, Manny?  You can say it in Swahili, Manny.  I still know you're giving him the answer.\\"  [She] liked them to help each other, but today she wanted to find out just how each one was faring in multiplication, so she kept saying, \\"Your own work.\\"<br />\\"Diablo!\\"<br />\\"You keep it up, Manny, and I'll show you what a diablo I can be.\\"<br />Anyone who's curious about the life of a teacher--or who is thinking of becoming a teacher--would do themselves a huge favor to sit down and read \\"Among Schoolchildren.\\"	2002-09-30

It's amazing to me how many cookbooks are actually sort of hard to follow when it comes to the directions, but this one isn't.  The design is attractive and the font easy to read.  Each recipe direction is numbered--a wonderful thing if you happen to look away and lose your place.

I can't find one that doesn't come across as utterly mouthwatering.  Stew is comfort food at its most primal, of course, and Wright gets down and dirty and primal with the ingredients.  You'll find stews here calling for rabbit, for instance, and he even gives a brief overview of a Canadian specialty called Assiniboin Bear Stew (which he cautions you not to make unless you're prepared to marinate the bear meat in either wine or vinegar).

This means, of course, that when the horrific events of Tuesday, September 11th took place, there were dozens and dozens of superbly qualified and talented photographers all over the city.  As if by reflex, these brave women and men documented the events of that day.<br />The photographs get first consideration here.  There is text, of course, but the photographs tell the story.  It's difficult to look through the book and not feel as though you were there yourself.  Witness Steve McCurry's triptych of the second tower coming down, looking for all the world like a dying flower, the smoke almost appearing like drooping petals curving down towards the earth (p. 8).  Witness Susan Meiselas' photograph of one of those life-size statues you see hither and yon in Manhattan--this one of a cheerfully smiling businessman seated on a bench, opening up his briefcase to check on something.  He is knee-deep in debris, and trees behind and beside him are crushed and bent (p. 30).  The juxtaposition perfectly captures the sense of disconnectedness and inability to understand that we all felt that day.  Witness Eli Reed's enormously moving photo of a construction worker wielding only a hammer.  The man sits on a steel beam, hard hat on, booted feet tucked behind him.  When you look beyond his hammer, you see the physical devastation all around him--yet there he sits, hammering as though he will make a difference (p. 104).  Witness Gilles Peress' shots of shocked people appearing out of the snowy dust, accompanied by his simple and heartfelt statement: \\"I don't trust words.  I trust pictures\\" (pp. 46 - 63).<br />\\"New York September 11\\" is an astonishing and heartbreaking photographic documentary of that day.  I recommend it as a record for your children and yourself.	2002-09-25

He debunks an awful lot of incorrect gossip (like the oft-told tale of Catherine the Great's predilection for beastiality) and comes up with wonderful gems of dirt that will be deliciously unfamiliar to most readers.

She commits the shocking act of simply walking away from her family on the beach one day, hitching a ride to wherever seems far away enough, and beginning a new life at the town of Bay Borough, Maryland.  One by one, different members of her family track her down and she is drawn to them while simultaneously becoming more and more part of Bay Borough life.  It's a fascinating account of a momentous decision, and the many repercussions of that decision.<br />When Delia finally returns to her family's home in Baltimore for an important family occasion, we want to see the tension either drawn tight (yes, she was right to leave!) or dissipated (of course, here's where she really belongs).  Unfortunately, Tyler fails to really expand upon this theme and because of this, the ending is not only abrupt, but startling.  This is the only Anne Tyler novel I ever finished with a feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment.	2002-09-21

Without giving away too much detail for those who haven't had the profound pleasure of reading this engrossing novel themselves, Morgan ends up grasping at something he thinks will make life different and boy, does it ever.<br />That makes this sound like a depressing novel, which it most certainly is not.  Morgan and his wife, Bonny, are the parents of seven daughters, and the novel is a lively one filled with the fully three-dimensional, quirky, utterly human characters for which Tyler is justly famed.  The underpinnings of the story are serious (what do you do when everything about your life is different from what you'd hoped or imagined?), but the novel itself has many hilarious moments.  Witness Morgan in Cullen's Hardware Store, where he has worked forever and where he is absolutely no good with the customers:<br />Morgan had to rise and dust off his knees, regretfully, and wait on a man in coveralls who wanted to buy a Hide-A-Key.  &quot;What for?&quot; Morgan asked.  &quot;Why spend good money on a little tin box?  Do you see the price of this thing?&quot;<br />&quot;Well, but last week I locked the keys inside my car, don't you know, and I was thinking how maybe I could hide an extra key beneath the--&quot;<br />&quot;Look,&quot; said Morgan.  &quot;All you do is take a piece of dental floss, waxed.  Surely you have dental floss.  Thread your extra key on it, double it for strength, tie it to your radiator grille and ket the key hang down inside.  Simple!  Costs you nothing.&quot;<br />&quot;Well, but this here Hide-A-Key--&quot;<br />&quot;Are you not standing in the presence of a man whose wife perpetually mislays his car keysfor him?&quot; Morgan asked.  The man glanced around him.  &quot;ME, I mean.  She loses all I own,&quot; Morgan said, &quot;And I've never had a Hide-A-Key in my life.&quot;<br />&quot;Well, still,&quot; the man said doggedly, &quot;I think I'll just go ahead with this here.&quot;<br />&quot;What is it?&quot; Morgan asked. &quot;You don't have dental floss? Never mind!  I tell you what I'll do: you come back this same time tomorrow, I'll have a piece for you from home.  Free, no charge.  A gift.  All right?  I'll bring you in a yard or two.&quot;<br />&quot;For Christ's sake,&quot; said the man, &quot;will you let me buy one cruddy Hide-A-Key?&quot;<br />Morgan flung his hands up.  &quot;Of course!&quot; he said. &quot;Be my guest! Waste your money!  Fill your life with junk!&quot;  He stabbed the cash register keys.  &quot;A dollar twenty-nine,&quot; he said.<br />&quot;It's MY dollar-twenty-nine, I'll waste it however I like,&quot; said the man, pressing the money into Morgan's palm.  &quot;Maniac.&quot;<br />&quot;Junkie!&quot;<br />There are many riches in &quot;Morgan's Passing,&quot; and I highly recommend it to anyone who discovered Anne Tyler later in her career and hasn't yet indulged in her earlier works.  This is a super book.	2002-09-19

There are spaceships blasting off towards outer space; middle-class living rooms; classrooms; general stores, and more, all of which are chock-full of items Steiner employs to look like something else.

It's criminal that Calvin Trillin's superb &quot;American Stories&quot; is out of print.  Trillin gives us a look at, among other things, a drive-in-movie-theatre critic; a crime reporter; an obscure 1950s singing group; an insistent property-rights battle in Virginia; and so much more.  Every single one of these stories--while not something you might find yourself hankering to read about, exactly--becomes something utterly fascinating in Trillin's capable hands.  Frankly, I think that Calvin Trillin could make lard production an absorbing read.<br />Trillin's inimitably calm, deadpan voice is in fine form here.  Just a quick sample, from a piece about a dispute between Pillsbury and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream:<br />The campaign started slowly, but eventually thousands of people called the Doughboy Hot Line, and thousands of words appeared in the press about Ben &amp; Jerry's . . . Some of the letters people sent to Pillsbury or Häagen-Dazs were businesslike (&quot;I would like to admonish you to adopt a policy of fair play&quot;), but it was more typical for them to express outrage at &quot;the desire to use the corporate heel to stamp out your competition&quot; or to begin by saying &quot;CORPORATIONS LIKE YOURS REALLY MAKE ME SICK!&quot;  A remarkable number of the letters of support received by Ben &amp; Jerry's mentioned the writer's favorite flavor; some of them even mentioned the writer's favorite flavor of Häagen-Dazs.  One of them was signed &quot;Helene 'Dastardly Mash' Jones.&quot;  Some of them were from outraged schoolchildren, who offered to help by, say, forming gangs of Doughboy Busters.<br />This is but a tiny example of the riches available in this most satisfying book.  Read it and laugh out loud and enjoy the glittering mosaic of America that Trillin presents here.	2002-09-14

While at Yale, Hansen was so highly thought of that he was profiled in LIFE magazine and his classmates used to kid each other about which cabinet position they'd fill once Hansen had been elected President.  After Yale, however, Hansen failed to live up to the high expectations everyone--friends, family, teachers, coaches--had for him.  Trillin's book is a delicate examination of what that meant, both for Denny and for his constellation of friends and well-wishers.<br />Denny doesn't come alive as vividly as might be hoped here, but Trillin does an outstanding job of sketching this young man's life in terms of a larger picture about America.  In a country where success on every level is much prized, Trillin subtly but thoroughly plumbs the reasons why Denny didn't succeed--at least not to the extent everyone thought he would.  This uncharacteristically somber book is absorbing and thought-provoking, even if it doesn't quite reach the goals Trillin seems to have set for himself in the beginning chapters.	2002-09-14

You've heard of Poet Laureates; well, Trillin ought to be our national Deadpan and Danged Funny Laureate.  What may not be immediately evident on first reading his work is that the subtle humor that ripples throughout most of his stuff disguises an extraordinarily sharp mind and a nose for a wonderful story.<br />&quot;Killings&quot; examines the sudden deaths of a dozen or so ordinary Americans.  Although Trillin touches on the manner of their deaths, what &quot;Killings&quot; is really about is the detail of these victims' lives.  It is utterly absorbing and that rarity, a book you will enjoy even more on the second or third read than on the first.  Trillin's apparent artlessness ensures that he, as author, never gets in the way of his wonderful, wonderful stories.  Highly recommended!	2002-09-14

Instead, these men descend into a hell brought on by their own selfishness and suspicion.<br />Brothers Hank and Jacob Mitchell are out one day in the woods with a friend, Lou, when their dog bounds into the deepest, darkest part of the woods.  Trying without success to find her, they stumble across a downed plane:<br />\\"The plane was resting flat on its belly, as if it were a toy and a giant hand had reached down out of the sky to set it there, snug beneath the branches of the trees.  There were remarkably few signs of damage.  Its propeller was twisted out of shape, its left wing was bent back a bit, tearing a tiny hole in the fuselage, but the land itself was relatively unmarked; there were no upturned trees, no jagged , black gashes in the earth to reveal its path of impact . . . \\"<br />Then they find the pilot, a gruesome sight that makes them understand that the plane crashed some time ago.  They puzzle over how they had heard nothing about it.  But it's when they find several million dollars that the light flicks on over their heads: this is illegal, somehow, this money, and that's why no one has reported it.  That's why they've heard nothing about it.  That's why it's there for the taking.  Why not? They reason.  Who could possibly be hurt by our taking money that's lying out here in the woods with no one to claim it?<br />Smith takes their \\"simple plan\\" and with the introduction of each new obstacle or unforeseen circumstance, he deftly turns it a tiny bit, then a tiny bit more, then a tiny bit further.  The result is that by the end, the seemingly simple plan of the Mitchell brothers and their friend Lou has devolved into madness, mayhem, and creeping paranoia.  It's a masterful and powerfully creepy novel.	2002-09-12

He covers water conservation, the migration of seeds and spores, hunting, the crumbling of a tree into loam from which another tree will eventually grow.  At his very best, Leopold raises both the level of discourse and the level of writing to something that can stand with the finest literature:<br />&quot;Within a few weeks now, Draba, the smallest flower that blows, will sprinkle every sandy place with small blooms.  He who hopes for spring with upturned eye will never see so small a thing as Draba.  He who despairs of spring with downcast eye steps on it, unknowing.  He who searches for spring with his knees in the mud finds it, in abundance.  Draba asks, and gets, but scant allowance of warmth and comfort; it subsists on the leavings of unwanted time and space.  Botany books give it two or three lines, but never a plate or portrait.  Sand too poor and sun too weak for bigger, better blooms are good enough for Draba.  After all, it is no spring flower, but only a postscript to a hope.&quot;<br />When Leopold can describe a tiny nothing of a plant with such delicacy, beauty, and restraint, you know that you are reading the work of a rare and informed writer.  I could quote from the book forever, as the gorgeous passages are many, but I urge you to read it yourself instead and discover an enduring voice in defense of the American wilderness.	2002-09-11

Shute takes the most horrific event one can imagine--a worldwide nuclear event--and then turns the microscope on it, focusing in on just a few ordinary people who must wait for death as it drifts over to their hemisphere.  We see military personnel, housewives, businessmen, and more.  They come alive because they are just like you and me and the people next door.  <br />Shute's very great accomplishment here is to examine how each of the characters deals with their certain death.  Everyone knows they'll die eventually; these characters have the difficulty of knowing that death will arrive soon, and that it will be slow and agonizing.  What do they do?  Each reacts differently and the humanity and humility with which some of the characters make their choices is startlingly powerful.  Especially in a time when the world seems so uncertain, so cruel, this is an important book to read--or re-read if you picked it up years ago.  Prepare yourself for a powerfully moving experience.	2002-09-11

H. G. \\"Buzz\\" Bissinger's \\"Friday Night Lights\\" takes a look at one school year in Odessa, Texas, and how high school football saturates everything in the town, from church to school to home to teenage romance.  Bissinger and his family actually lived in Odessa for the year he covers, and his immersion in and knowledge of the subject shows.  He stays on the sidelines, reporting only, never commenting or being subjective.  <br />The result is simultaneously fascinating and repellant.  Take, for instance, the Pepettes--high school girls who are each \\"assigned\\" a member of the football team.  They are expected to care for and wait on these boys in ways that seem almost like something out of ancient Rome:<br />\\"As part of the tradition, each Pepette brought some type of sweet for her player every week before the game.  She didn't necessarily have to make something from scratch, but there was indirect pressure to because of not-so-private grousing from players who tired quickly of bags of candy and not so discreetly let it be known that they much preferred something fresh-baked.  If she had to buy something store-bought, it might as well be beer, and at least one player was able to negotiate such an arrangement with his Pepette during the season.  Instead of getting a bag of cookies, he got a six-pack of beer.<br />\\"In addition, each Pepette also had to make a large sign for her player that went into his front hard and stayed there the entire season as a notice to the community that he played football for Permian [High School].  Previously the making of these yard signs, which looked like miniature Broadway marquees, had become quite competitive.  Some of the Pepettes spent as much as $100 of their own money to make an individual sign, decorating it with twinkling lights and other attention-getting devices.  It became a rather serious game of can-you-top-this, and finally a dictum was handed down that all signs must be made the same way, without any neon.<br />\\"A Pepette also had responsibility for making smaller posters, which went up in the school halls at the beginning of each week and were transferred to the gym for the mandatory Friday morning pep rally . . . These were the basic Pepette requirements, but some girls went beyond in their show of spirit.  They might embroider the map of Texas on towels and then spell out MOJO in the borders.  Or they might make MOJO pillowcases that the players could take with them on road trips.  Of they might place their fresh-baked cookies in tins elaborately decorated with the Permian colors of black and white.  In previous years Pepettes had made scrapbooks for their players, including one with the cover made of lacquered wood and modeled on Disney's 'Jungle Book.' \\"<br />The level of commitment by the Pepettes to their players is reflective of the energy the entire town puts into football.  Odessa is a small town, and failing economically, and the Friday night lights of the title are one thing over which everyone seems to bond.<br />Bissinger does a dead-on job of nailing both the subtle racism and the near abuse the players go through via their coaches and the other teams--it's telling that the team colors are black and white.  He also vigorously details, to devastating effect, the difficulty these boys have adjusting to life after high school, when their football exploits are no longer what defines them.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is an all-around superb rendering of a microcosm of American society.	2002-09-11

She has no social life to speak of and spends her evenings listening to the radio.  This habit is what sets the plot into motion when she hears an interview on a local radio show hosted by an elderly DJ named Herbert:<br />One evening in February there was a guest on the program.  He came right after the &quot;News of the Hour.&quot;  <br />&quot;I have here a Mr. Bertram Casey,&quot; said Herbert.  &quot;Better known as, known as Drumstrings.&quot;  He coughed and shuffled some papers.  &quot;It's an honor to have you with us, Mr. Casey.&quot;  No one answered.  Evie was sitting on the bed, twisting her hair into scratchy little pincurls.  When the silence grew noticeable she took a bobby pin from her mouth and looked at the radio.  All she heard was static.  Finally Herbert said, &quot;Well.  This is the beginning of a new feature on 'Sweetheart Time': interviews.  May I ask if you are a native North Carolinian, Mr. Casey?&quot;<br />Someone said, &quot;Not for long I won't be.&quot;  His voice was cool and motionless, like a stone plunked into a pool.  Herbert coughed again.<br />&quot;Whereabouts in North Carolina?&quot; he asked.<br />&quot;Farinia.&quot;<br />&quot;Farinia, yes.  Off of Highway--&quot;<br />&quot;But I'm leaving there,&quot; said Drumstrings Casey.<br />&quot;All right.  Where is it you're going?&quot;<br />&quot;A city, some city.  It ain't quite clear yet.  I aim to cut records and play night clubs, and if I once wiggle out of here I'm never coming back again, not even for Christmas.  If my family gets to missing me they can come to where I'm at, I'll buy them a house with white telephones and a swimming pool.&quot;<br />Evie is transfixed by this young man and shortly afterwards sees him perform live.  Wanting something--anything--to make her life exciting, she ends up carving his name onto her forehead with nail scissors.  This gets her the attention she wants, with very unlikely results.  <br />Drum and Evie's relationship forms the core of the book, and it's a penetrating look at the way two people can be together and even love each other without ever really knowing or understanding what the other person is all about.  The ending is somewhat unsatisfying--it felt abrupt and hurried to me, as though Tyler had suddenly tired of writing the novel--but the book as a whole is a delight and every word rings true.	2002-09-09

When Elizabeth wanders into the lives of the Emerson family, she becomes, as Mrs. Emerson so tellingly describes things early in the book, &quot;the center of the asterisk.&quot;  <br />Elizabeth is trying to earn money to go back to college for her senior year--even though &quot;my grades were rotten&quot;--and on her way to interview for a long-term babysitting job, she ends up helping Pamela Emerson move some porch furniture.  Mrs. Emerson asks her to stay on as a handyman, to replace the one she fired that morning, and Elizabeth cheerfully agrees as long as she can &quot;live in.&quot;  This innocent beginning to the story belies the complexities and emotional connections that are made and broken in the rest of the book.  <br />Without giving away too much of the plot to those who've never had the pleasure of reading it, it's safe to say that Elizabeth's presence has an emotional impact on several of Mrs. Emerson's sons--one of whom feels strongly enough about her that he does something terrible.  This is the event which finally completes Elizabeth's long metamorphosis from determinedly carefree, irresponsible girl to full-grown woman--a woman who understands, finally, the effect that one person can have on another without even meaning to.  <br />The writing is superb and the plot develops organically, fully, and with a resolution which makes perfect sense.  Anne Tyler was in full control of her considerable gifts back in 1972 when she wrote this, and aren't we lucky that she was!	2002-09-09

Wilhide combines dozens of sumptuous color photographs of Morris interiors with an overview of his life, his influences, and his artistic goals.  I learned a number of interesting things about his personal background, such as:<br />- His beautiful wife Jane had a long affair with fellow artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti; <BR>- In addition to his design work, he was such a respected poet that he was offered the poet laureateship of England once Tennyson had died;<BR>- Many of his designs are still in active production today, more than a century after his death.<br />Morris shunned the effect the Industrial Revolution had had on the arts in England (and elsewhere) and proposed that hand-crafted art, furniture, wallpaper, and so on be the goal of an artists' cooperative he helped to found.  He felt that art should be in every home and that it should be useful, beautiful to look at, and durable.  This success of the cooperative produced the uncomfortable situation, for Morris, of having art be so beautifully and painstakingly produced by hand that, in the end, only the wealthy could afford it.  <br />The photographs of Morris interiors, wallpaper designs, furniture, and more, are absolutely sumptuous, and Wilhide's well-informed and well-written text helps to expand our understanding of the whole of Morris' life.  Highly recommended!	2002-09-09

He uses his adult design skills to create great manmade beauty from existing natural beauty.  He never falls over the line into obvious, coy, or precious art--he simply lets nature be what it is with a tiny little bit of rearranging on his part.<br />The results are never short of astonishing.  Witness the sharp-edged rocks against which Goldsworthy has &quot;glued&quot; (with plain water) the leaves of brilliantly red Japanese maples, thereby making the edges look almost bloodied (p. 76).  Witness the delicate, calligraphic tracery Goldsworthy stitched up by pinning together rush after rush after rush with thorns and then hanging these on a gallery wall so that it appears that either Calder or Matisse have wandered in and scribbled elegantly on the walls (p. 83).  Witness the balanced oval boulders Goldsworthy lays in a curvaceous line from beach to the sea, and see how they roll and disappear from view as the tide comes crashing in (p. 101).  These are but three of the many visual astonishments Goldsworthy shares in this book.  The book is a never-ending source of delight and admiration for the feverish workings of one of 20th-century art's most creative minds.	2002-09-07

There's a big puddle nearby, and a lot of weeds.  You idly pick up pebble after pebble, placing them gently one on top of the other, winding what ends up being a wall through the weeds until it gets to the edge of the puddle.  That's the deliciously disconcerting feeling you'll get as you page through Andy Goldsworthy's \\"Wall.\\"<br />A document of the design and construction of Goldsworthy's wall at Mountainville, New York, the book details the finding of the original, now-falling-down stone wall and the decision to recreate and embellish upon this.  Andy Goldsworthy was called in to design the new wall.  While he begins by following what is left of the old wall, his work is looser, more elegant, almost scroll-like as it winds down the hill and plunges directly into the water of the lake.  There is a calligraphic quality to this wall that's visually arresting and, quite simply, beautiful.<br />Along with the wall, Goldsworthy can't resist playing with nature in other ways and these photographs are thoughtfully included as well.  We see the line of chrome yellow leaves he's stitched together and placed on the wall, the holes he's filled with crimson leaves and water, and the tree whose bark he's lined with, well, other trees!  It's astounding to see how Goldsworthy's brain works and what handsome design statements result from his creativity.	2002-09-07

In \\"A Collaboration with Nature,\\" Goldsworthy shows us the miracles he has wrought with the simplest materials he finds in front of him: mere stones, water, leaves, branches, mud, and thorns, all \\"found objects,\\" become the sundry mediums through which Goldsworthy works his visual sorcery.<br />Just a few of dozens of high points in the book:<br />- A graceful circle on the ground, created with brown leaves on the outer perimeter, warming to red, then orange, then yellow leaves toward the center;<br />- A \\"slate crack line\\" created when Goldsworthy carefully arranged pieces of slate so that the edges formed a seeming \\"crack\\" in the pile;<br />- Three \\"statues\\" made of balanced ovoid rocks in the middle of a snow-covered stream, each appearing to be something like well-rounded Giacomettis;<br />- A snowball eerily suspended in and supported by the trees which surround it;<br />- A rectangle of snow, in the middle of which Goldsworthy has carefully carved concentric, successively shallower circles so that the light gleams from the center but gets dimmer and dimmer with each larger circle;<br />- A sycamore branch placed on a bed of snow, juxtaposed with the same sycamore branch stripped of bark and placed on a bed of leaves--the first is dark against white, and the second is white against dark;<br />- An arching series of ice triangles, each of which has been painstakingly stuck to the next and balanced on a moss-covered rock--this looks almost like a glass wing of some sort.<br />I could go on and on by covering every single page in the book, but I'll leave it to you to find out for yourself what a visual feast Goldsworthy provides for the eyes--and what interesting mental exercise he provides for the mind of the observant viewer.	2002-09-07
US	47346111	R1F8OC5LRVLEZ5	0679736379	385024829	Sophie's Choice	Books	5	32	37	N	N	An extraordinary story	William Styron's \\"Sophie's Choice\\" has to stand as one of the 20th century's great American novels.  Based very loosely on his own experiences in the late 1940s in New York, Styron makes himself into a writer called Stingo who moves into a boarding house in Brooklyn, where he meets a Polish emigré named Sophie and her dangerously unpredictable lover, Nathan.  With great delicacy and restraint, Styron traces the evolution of the friendship and love that entangles these three and which has stunning consequences.<br />For those who have only seen the 1985 movie starring Meryl Streep (and for which she deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar), do yourself a favor and read the book.  The movie was indeed wonderful, but the book is so much richer and more detailed and Styron's mastery of this compelling narrative is marvelous to behold.  For those who have NOT seen the film, you will assume that \\"Sophie's Choice\\" has to do with Nathan and Stingo.  Heartbreakingly, it both does and does not.  <br />Styron has an incredible gift for injecting humor into dark situations.  He makes Stingo an inordinately horny, frustrated, pained, wise-cracking man in his early 20s--Stingo leaps off the pages as fully formed and utterly human.  Nathan too, in a much different way, is three-dimensional and fiery with life.  Sophie is rendered in more delicate tones than the two men, which makes the final chapters of the book all the more powerful.  We see what she has withstood and what she has given up and it is inescapably heartbreaking.  <br />The book's ending is utterly right and the inexorable product of all that has gone before it.  Styron has taken an enormously complex panoply of subjects--young manhood, post-WWII New York, mental illness, obsession, guilt, and more--and structured them into one of the most un-put-downable novels you will ever read.	2002-09-06

The timing was such that Styron had the odd experience of a) being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the book and b) being shunned by many, black and white, for having had the temerity to put himself in the mind of a black slave when he himself was a white Southerner.  <br />The color of Styron's skin doesn't matter anymore than it should for anyone else.  &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a brutal accounting, from Nat Turner's point of view, of the events that led up to the only long-term revolt in the disgraceful history of American slavery.  We see the beginnings of Turner's musings when, as a young and extraordinarily intelligent slave, he fights mentally against his enslavement.  It's when the dam bursts and he decides to fight physically that his downfall begins.  There is a suggestion of perhaps not mental illness, but a messianic complex here in Styron's rendering of Turner.  It works, for a character in a novel, but some readers will be taken aback by the fact that Styron makes Turner somehow mentally unstable.<br />As with all books, the uninitiated reader wants to know: is it a good read?  It is.  It's propulsive and majestic and the kind of book you don't want to end.  Styron handles the ending with great delicacy and restraint.  &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; is a sustained and detailed portrait of a compelling figure in early American history.  It is a masterpiece.	2002-09-06

Wendy Northcutt had the imagination and good sense to start the Darwin Awards some years ago, and she's now compiled the best ones into a book.  \\"The Darwin Awards\\" examines what Northcutt calls \\"the finest examples of evolution in action\\"--that is to say, just-plain-stupid folks who are killed (or sometimes just maimed) through direct result of their own stupidity.  Northcutt's premise is based on the idea that these idiots have done the human race a favor by removing themselves from the gene pool.<br />Northcutt not only details some hilarious stories herein, she tells you whether or not they were \\"confirmed by the Darwin Awards\\" (most were) and what newspapers or magazines the original accounts appear in when the unfortunate event first took place.  She also examines a number of remarkably resilient urban legends (remember the one about the guys, the dynamite, the iced-over lake, the SUV that hadn't yet been fully paid for, and the faithful dog?) and gives you her take on possible origins of the stories and what clearly makes them urban legends instead of true, out-and-out Darwin Award contenders.<br />This book is a laugh a minute.  You will be astonished at some of the idiotic things people do without thinking--looking into a gas tank or a loaded gun with a lit match, trying to get fish by dropping live electrical wires into a lake (then wandering in to retrieve said fish without removing or turning off the wires), and so on and so on.  What a guilty pleasure this book is!	2002-09-05

She knows which flavors go together beautifully (white chocolate and apricot, anyone?) and gives you not only &quot;the usual suspects&quot; of flavor combinations, but some deliciously unusual ones as well.  She takes carrot cake to a sublime level by giving you a recipe for Honey Maple Carrot Cake with Pecans and Raisins (perfect for that crunchy granola bride who's wearing flip-flops, a wreath of daisies in her hair, and a cotton gauze dress).  For an autumn wedding, what could be prettier or more appropriate than a Pumpkin Cake with Crystallized Ginger, Walnuts, and Dried Cranberries? The Gianduja Truffle Cake is a dream of a dessert which incorporates both bittersweet chocolate and gianduja paste, a hazelnut/chocolate confection that's typically Italian and utterly delicious.  For the second-time or ultra-sophisticated bride who wants something utterly different, Wilson provides a recipe for a handsome and savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake Wedding Cake.  I could go on and on, for all the cakes here are splendid to look at and really, truly not difficult to make as much as demanding of your time.<br />Even those who haven't foolishly offered to provide a wedding cake for someone they love will get a kick out of the sumptuous photographs, the clear, clear, clear directions, and the fact that almost every single recipe can be made as just a regular cake as well (hint: just make one tier of the many tiers involved and you're in business!).  Highly recommended!	2002-09-05
US	47346111	R2FX6QXMHOE6DI	0810919931	546835998	Arch	Books	5	5	6	N	N	More astonishing art from Andy Goldsworthy	There may be more imaginative artists than Andy Goldsworthy, but I can't think of any who use natural materials in natural settings in such an astonishingly effective manner.  In &quot;Arch,&quot; Goldsworthy traces--through photographs and a sort of diary--the movement of a sandstone arch through the farmlands of southwestern Scotland (his own &quot;home territory&quot;).  This simple arch--a sort of brick-red, roughly hewn curve--is set up and dismantled in all sorts of unlikely places, mostly sheepfolds, along the way.  It is photographed and a small entry written about its placement in each particular place.  <br />The very first photograph, in Dumfriesshire, shows the arch almost glowing with ruddy color as a threateningly black sky looms overhead.  From there, we variously see the arch at the edge of a hauling company's parking lot; in a livestock feedlot; in the middle of a road; with one foot in a narrow stream and the other in a grassy field; and even, wittily, beneath another stone arch which forms the doorway into a barn.  <br />In each setting, the arch almost speaks to us.  It looks by turns completely at home and relaxed all the way up to shy and out of place.  Goldsworthy's great achievement here is to imbue a simple and completely inanimate object with different moods and faces depending upon the setting.  The arch becomes almost a Rohrschach test for the reader.  Most interesting!	2002-09-04
US	47346111	R2FZETKM4LJ77Q	0810944820	990819388	Time	Books	5	32	32	N	N	Another superb look at Andy Goldsworthy's ephemeral art	Andy Goldsworthy's artwork is utterly ephemeral and fleeting, and perhaps because of this, utterly transfixing.  There is something of the ancients in the way Goldsworthy puts together stone, or wood, or leaves--or even in the way he lays himself down on a dry patch of ground in the rain so that when he gets up, we see a sort of reverse shadow of his body.  There is an astonishing intellect at work here, and a soul which sees the value in what some art snobs might term &quot;mere beauty.&quot;<br />Goldsworthy's many mediums are covered in &quot;Time,&quot; which features sumptuous photography by Terry Friedman.  We see perfectly constructed stone cairns--some pyramidal, some only half done and all the more startling for what isn't there as for what is.  We see ruddy sandstone arches four times the height of a man.  But Goldsworthy's most consistently inviting work is done not in stone, but in the ephemera nature leaves for him everywhere he looks.  Goldsworthy's work is sometimes so fleeting as to question the very nature of whether it constitutes art when it lasts only minutes or hours.  The frost shadows, for instance, are simply photographs of the still-iced patches of grass over which Goldsworthy stood in the early morning, then stepped aside so that a photograph could be taken.  Of course these are gone within minutes as the sun warms the now-exposed grass.  Is this art?  Merely the fact that you question it shows your engagement with the work--Goldsworthy fosters a kind of subtle dialogue between reader and artist and the dialogue is consistently engaging.  Another heat-destroyed piece is the thinnest imaginable sheet of ice, laid against a moss-covered rock, and Goldsworthy's handprint visible on it.  As it thawed, it buckled and disappeared and we see its disappearance in the photographs.  It's lovely, it's witty and it is, improbably art.<br />Other things disappear, too, but not from the sun's warmth.  There is a &quot;stick hole&quot; Goldsworthy built early one spring which he and Friedman came back to photograph throughout the summer until the final photograph shows it utterly covered with the lacy ferns which grew up around it.  There are the perfectly circular or perfectly ovoid leaf rafts Goldsworthy stitches together, then sends on their way down a meandering stream, having their path photographed before they disappear.  There are the piled of rocks he constructs leading into the ocean so that the tides swallow them up--each stage meticulously recorded on film.  <br />Perhaps the most transformative art in the book is the mud wall displayed on the cover.  Goldsworthy applied mud to walls and floor in such a way that when the mud cracked and dried, it showed the meandering, snakelike pattern he'd put into it.  It has become something entirely different solely through the passage of time.  This book is filled with surprises and delights, and will have you utterly absorbed, charmed, and astonished.  I can't recommend it highly enough.	2002-09-04

Although I don't have much of a scientific bent, I have always been fascinated by archaeology (probably too many Agatha Christie novels), and I treated myself to this many years ago to see if the real thing was as interesting as I imagined it to be.  While nothing can completely convey the hard and tedious work that makes up the bulk of an archaeologist's days, McIntosh's book goes a long way towards clarifying the astonishing things all of us can learn from archaeology.<br />The book is arranged chronologically, beginning with a chapter providing a broad idea of what archaeology can mean and its function in modern times.  From there McIntosh moves deftly to excavation, processing \\"finds,\\" and analyzing them.  She covers both above-ground excavations and those below-ground, and even gets into oceanic archaeology.  We learn about how excavation and preservation techniques have improved, while many of the archaeologist's most treasured tools--hands, sieves, and fine brushes--have remained much the same for centuries.  <br />This is a beautifully designed book.  Color photographs, black-and-white photos, engravings, and sketches are skillfully combined with an easy-to-read text.  This is an excellent introduction to archaeology for anyone who has even a remote interest in the subject--it's difficult to put down once you begin reading it.  Highly recommended!	2002-09-02

The finches in question are those Darwin studied on the Galápagos Islands, and are the birds which first stirred for him the musings of his revolutionary theory.<br />Two evolutionary biologists from Princeton University are on the Galápagos Islands, studying these finches, and understanding first-hand how evolutionary changes can visibly take place in just a single season. The story hinges on the meshing together of food and consumer.  If it's a rainy season, certain of the island's trees will produce more or fewer of certain fruits, nuts, and seeds. The shape and degree of curvature of a particular finch's beak, it seems, is eminently well-suited to breaking apart and eating some foods and not so much to others.  Therefore, a few inches more or less of rain in a single season can favor one finch's beak shape over another's--ensuring that certain finches will predominate because they have the beak shape which makes eating easier.  Of course this can then swing back the other way the following season.  <br />Weiner makes this story utterly absorbing for the lay-reader and serious science reader alike.  He sums up the entire book in the splendidly chosen example of watching a volcano, writing that seeing a volcano from many miles away, the smoke and lava and movement seem all rather slow and smudgy.  Seeing it from the island on which it is situated, of course, is another matter entirely and we can witness for ourselves the terrifying speed with which one eruption changes everything instantly.  Weiner ensures through this single passage that we gain a well-rounded idea of what evolution can mean in just a single lifetime, a single year, or even a single season.  This is a fascinating true story that is written with the pacing of a thriller.  Highly recommended!	2002-09-02

Field has gathered together hundreds of important photographs (of the nearly half million she saw altogether) of Queen Elizabeth's jewels.  These are shown both in their cases and being worn by various monarchs, and we see how different royal family members have altered the look or the purpose of pieces as fashions and times changed over the years.  Field has complemented these photographs with her outstanding, meticulously researched text.  Even if you purchase the book mostly to drool over the photographs, you will end up being both captivated and educated by the accompanying text.<br />Field begins the book with the ascension of Queen Victoria to the throne.  Because of the Salic laws passed by the House of Hanover in 1833, Victoria was prevented from becoming ruler of both the United Kingdom and Hanover.  The kingdoms were split for the first time in well over a century.  Immediately, King Ernest of Hanover--an uncle of Queen Victoria--demanded his share of the royal jewels, arguing that since the kingdom had been split, so must be the gems.  Victoria disagreed, and the argument went on for two decades before finally being settled in favor of Hanover.  Subsequently, Victoria gave up several important pieces of jewelry to her uncle's descendants--but was already well on her way to amassing an important collection.<br />Victoria was the first British monarch to make clear that some pieces belonged to the Crown and were for use by any Queen to follow her--and that some pieces were her personal property, and hers to dispose of as she saw fit.  British monarchs have followed in her footsteps ever since and although Field showcases many sumptuous Crown pieces in the book, the bulk of what we see are the Queen's personal pieces.  And what a collection it is!<br />The collection is vast and jaw-droppingly beautiful.  Field wisely divides the book intotypes of stones, from diamonds and pearls to emeralds, sapphires, amethysts, turquoise, and more.  We see everything from parures <BR>(i. e., complete matching sets of everything from necklaces to brooches to rings to earrings and more) to necklaces and tiaras which were gifts from other governments or from such quaintly named organizations as \\"Girls of Great Britain and Ireland\\" to pieces designed by Prince Philip expressly for his wife.<br />Among the many stand-outs in the book are:<br />- Queen Elizabeth's three-carat diamond solitaire engagement ring, designed by Prince Philip for his wife and set with a handsome diamond taken from a tiara belonging to Philip's mother (p. 85);<br />- The Godman Necklace, which had been bought by an English naturalist in the 1890s while on holiday in Bavaria.  His daughters, many years after his death, wrote to the Lord Chamberlain saying that they felt they owned jewelry once owned by Empress Josephine of France and that the Queen might be interested in it.  Although it turned out not to have been of this provenance, it was undoubtedly a stunning and valuable piece, showcasing seven large emeralds and three smaller ones, and surrounded throughout with an encrustation of diamonds and platinum filigree (p. 95);<br />- The Cambridge's Lover's Knot Tiara, shown being worn by the Duchess of Cambridge in 1818, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in the 1890s, Queen Mary in 1926, Queen Mary again in 1935 (this time without the upright pearls which originally adorned it), Queen Elizabeth in 1955, and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1985.  This is powerful testimony that good design and fine jewelry are both timeless (pp. 113 - 115);<br />- Queen Mary's \\"Rose of York\\" bracelet, which is a breathtaking ruby and diamond pendant which was eventually turned into a bracelet (p. 143).<br />Of course these are but a few of the many treasures in the book.  It is a fascinating read, and a wonderfully complete and detailed account of what is probably the finest jewelry collection in the world today.	2002-09-01

Those who are interested in a gemological history may be disappointed, as Proddow and Fasel concentrate solely on mostly modern diamonds set into jewelry--but those who salivate over the treasures of luminaries from Queen Elizabeth to Elizabeth Taylor will be delighted with this book.<br />Proddow and Fasel have done their homework and provide the reader with a lengthy history of the diamond and its stature in the jewelry world.  From the beginning, it was considered rare, unusual and much to be treasured--and its status as such ensured that it would be used in only the most elegant, important, and imaginative jewelry.  We learn of the origins of the famed Tiffany setting for diamonds.  This was a prong structure which supplanted the formerly popular bezel setting by exposing the pavilion (bottom) of the stone itself, thereby allowing more interplay of light and sparkle.  This seemingly simple approach ended up establishing Tiffany as one of the world's premier jewelers.  We learn about the freedom jewelers felt during the Art Deco and Art Nouveau periods--the freedom to approach jewelry as art and not just dull commissioned pieces from nobility.  We learn about the way Jackie Kennedy wore several diamond pins in her hair during a 1960s trip to Paris to SUGGEST the appearance of a tiara--without the royal associations of an actual tiara.<br />Proddow and Fasel have done their homework in providing splendid photographs of both well-known and rarely-seen diamond pieces.  The book is particularly strong in showcasing nature-oriented jeweled pieces.  Particular stand-outs include:<br />- An astonishingly beautiful butterfly brooch from the 1890s, in which the butterfly's body is made of a diamond and a ruby and the winds are enormous carved and etched diamonds (p. 20), not to mention a diamond and platinum butterfly brooch in which actual butterfly wings are encased in rock crystal (p. 32);<br />- An actual lion's paw seashell in which diamond tentacles climb the shell's grooves and set off the gleaming coral color (p. 87); <br />- An enormous Cartier snake necklace commissioned by Mexican actress Maria Felix in 1968 and featuring over 2,400 diamonds on one side.  The other side was done completely in colored enamels, making the necklace reversible (p. 112);<br />- A tortoise compact made from a real tortoise shell and pavé diamond head, feet, and tail (p. 130).<br />This book is an invaluable and instructive guide for anyone who loves diamond jewelry and appreciates the imaginative flights of fancy it inspires in its creators.  Highly recommended!	2002-08-31

Henkes not only does superbly human-like mice for the illustrations, but he has a firm grasp on what it is that makes kids tick: the impulsiveness, the buoyancy, the peevishness, and more.  He makes Lilly, our heroine, not only, well, human (even though she's a wee white mouse), but utterly sympathetic despite her faults.<br />Lilly has a fierce admiration for her very cool teacher, Mr. Slinger.  Then one fateful day, Lilly shows up with a totally fashionable purple plastic purse (accompanied by \\"glittery movie star sunglasses with real diamonds\\").  She, of course, is feeling that she's the height of mouse fashion and glamour, but Mr. Slinger puts a stop to that.  He irritates her by taking away the glasses and purse when it's clear that they're impeding Lilly's attention in class.  Lilly is furious and takes out her anger on Mr. Slinger in a sneaky way.  He meets her anger with patience and understanding, and she is apologetic.  All's right with the world by the end of the book.<br />Henkes has a marvelous and intuitive feel for the way little kids think and how they express themselves.  That, combined with his completely charming drawings, means that \\"Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse\\" is a grand way to spend twenty minutes reading to the nearest mouse-loving kid.	2002-08-28

Books	5	113	122	N	N	Possibly the only help most parents will ever need	I'm intrigued by other reviews here that gripe about the lack of new material in John Rosemond's latest update on &quot;Parent Power!&quot;  Remember, folks, the key word here is &quot;update.&quot;  It makes no claims to be an entirely new book.  The other thing to bear in mind is that good, sound, commonsensical advice on parenting is essentially the same today as it was a hundred--or a thousand--years ago.  It all boils down to one simple concept: you are in charge; the child is not.<br />Some people find Rosemond harsh.  Those tend to be parents who are willing to fill their time by wheedling, cajoling and bargaining with their children.  Others find Rosemond to make perfect sense.  Those tend to be parents who understand (and apply!) the fundamental concept that the parents have more experience and more expertise than the children do, and that it is a parental responsibility to take charge and tell the children what the rules are, how the family works, and what the consequences are for disobedience.<br />Rosemond knows whereof he speaks.  Not only is he a parent himself (two grown children--he's now a grandfather), but he has a doctorate in his chosen field.  The thing he writes in &quot;Parent Power!&quot; that struck me like a bolt of lightning was that parents who let their kids take the lead and rule the roost are doing the children a disservice.  Kids need and crave structure and order.  They like knowing what the boundaries are (even if at first it appears that they don't!).  When parents set boundaries and then don't keep within them--or lay down rules and then capitulate at the first request from the child--it actually disturbs the child, because it comes across as though the PARENT doesn't really know what the rules are.  And to the kid, that translates to the frightening thought, &quot;Well, gosh, if Mom and Dad don't know what the rules are, who DOES know?&quot;  <br />There's so much good stuff here.  I urge every parent--frustrated or not--to be open-minded and read this terrific book.  It's a treasure trove of useful, usable, sound information.	2002-08-28

They share with us, in casual, sounds-just-like-it's-them-talking style, the words which somehow strengthened or inspired them.  Many of the stories are from childhood, but a surprising number of them took place in adulthood.  Shaquille O'Neal relates how his mother once tartly told him he couldn't afford to wait to be good, because no one knows who will be here tomorrow and who won't.  This simple observation stunned O'Neal and set him on the path to athletic stardom.  Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos shares a simultaneously painful and hilarious story about telling his grandmother she was shortening her life through cigarette-smoking--and also shares his grandfather's gentle, measured response to his smart-alecky treatment of his grandmother.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg shares a charming story from her early married life:<br />The morning of [my] wedding, I was upstairs, making last-minute adjustments, when Marty's mother put something in my hand and said, \\"I am going to give you some advice that will serve you well: in every good marriage, it pays sometimes to be a little deaf.\\"  She had placed in my hand a set of wax earplugs.  I was puzzled.  What was she trying to convey?  I put her words in the back of my mind for a time, a rather short time as it turned out.  When Marty and I were on our honeymoon, I began to appreciate the wisdom of her advice.  The appreciation has grown enormously over the years.  My mother-in-law meant simply this.  Sometimes people say unkind or thoughtless things, and when they do, it's best to be a little hard of hearing--to tune out and not snap back in anger or impatience.  In my forty-seven years of marriage, I have recalled that advice regularly . . . But the idea behind the words reaches far beyond family . . . I drew upon [her] words when I was told I was not welcome in certain places because I am Jewish or that I could not do certain work because I am a woman.<br />The book is filled with great stuff like this--most of it elemental advice, but advice which resonates because it is larger and more complex than it looks.

She is a stunningly effective teacher, deftly combining in very little space English decorative history, English furniture and architectural styles, and the uniquely warm English touch with fabrics, floor coverings, and drapery.  The text is a miniature but very thorough education, and a delightful stroll through centuries of English history.<br />The photographs are something to behold.  Photographer Christopher Simon Sykes has presented a panoply of different takes on classically English style with a sober, all-seeing eye.  Nothing is prettied up--even a romantic candlelit dining room is presented in a straightforward manner--so that we are left to make up our own minds without Sykes' style being the thing we notice first about the pictures.<br />Everything the frustrated Anglophile/decorator could want is contained within these pages.  Irvine neatly divides the book in two--City (think Rex Harrison's home in the 1964 film version of \\"My Fair Lady\\") and Country (think Emma Thompson's place in either \\"Howards End\\" or \\"Sense & Sensibility\\").  Within these areas, she covers front halls, bedrooms, dining rooms, kitchens, and even bathrooms.  How great-looking can a bathroom be?  Well, the most beautiful bathroom I think I have ever seen in my life is featured on p. 171.  It may also be one of the most beautiful ROOMS I've ever seen, featuring as it does tall, divided-light mirrors which appear to be windows; a plain white tub surrounded with black, grey-streaked marble; pilasters and pediments a-plenty, but all covered with a restrained chalk white; dentil molding and paneled doors; and a perfectly handsome paneled toilet which would be perfectly at home in a living room in a lesser home.  Oh, yes, and let's don't forget the curvaceous bronze and crystal chandelier.  It sounds over the top, but it is perfectly composed, a lovely cameo of a room.  It ably embodies the idea that good design is never wasted, no matter how unimportant the room or how poorly it is sited.  Chippy Irvine continues to make that point, and many others, throughout the pages of this delightful and handsome book.	2002-08-26

The HOUSE &amp; GARDEN cool austerity--sometimes sacrificing warmth for hard-edged style, but many times not--is amply displayed throughout.<br />The book covers a panoply of styles, from &quot;Country Luxe&quot; to &quot;New International&quot; to &quot;Mid-Century Modern&quot; and beyond.  The shabby warmth of English-inspired rooms is covered, as is the prissier French look--but as HOUSE &amp; GARDEN so often does, there is almost always a visual wrench thrown into the works to get your attention and make you rethink your assumptions about a particular genre.  Perfectly making the point is the photograph on p. 25, which shows an 18th-century settee decorously covered in a taupe damask, above which hangs what appears to be a piece of Spirograph art made with screamingly bright primary oil paints.  The effect is jarring--but it works.<br />The thinking which goes into the decoration of these rooms is explored just as deeply as the looks themselves.  Although photographs take up most of the room--as they should, since this is a case when a picture telling a thousand words is not only desirable, but necessary for instructing the reader--the text is informative and enlightening.  The end result is that these profoundly individual rooms make their own cases, and what beautiful cases they make.	2002-08-26

It's always fascinating to see how interior designers decorate their own homes, instead of those they do for their clients.  You get the sense that while their homes represent sanctuary for them--as home rightly should--they also use their homes as design labs, testing this or that fabric or paint finish or furniture placement to see how it might work elsewhere.  <br />The names are ones design mavens will recognize: Sheila Bridges, Rachel Ashwell, Theodora van Runkle (who also did the costumes for several movies, including &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; in 1967), Isabelle de Borchgrave, Charlotte Moss, and more.  There is solid, if sometimes unsurprising, information here on aging fabrics, using different decorative and trompe-l'oeil paint techniques, placing pictures on the wall, and so on.  The layout of the book is attractive and uncluttered, the focus being solidly on the interiors--as it should be.  This would be a nice little addition to the library of any design or interiors fan.	2002-08-25

Carol Diggory Shields has hit paydirt with the excellent \\"I Am Really a Princess.\\"  This rollicking tale begins with the irresistible line, \\"I am really a princess.  And when my true parents, the king and queen, find out how I've been treated around here, they are going to be very upset.\\"<br />From this beginning, we are launched into a list of how our heroine will be living her life differently once the enormous injustice of her current situation is understood.  She'll have no chores, no homework, no pet-feeding duties.  The king and queen will spoil her rotten!  <br />Paul Meisel's illustrations are colorful and cartoony in a cheerful way.  They complement the text beautifully (check out his reverse version of a damsel-in-distress scene!).  Lots of fun for any little girl who's secretly convinced that she's a member of royalty!	2002-08-25

I admit right up front to being a complete sucker for Barry Moser's astonishing artwork, so you can imagine my delight when I found that Moser had not only illustrated \\"Our New Puppy,\\" but that he had collaborated on it with his granddaughter, Isabelle Harper!<br />\\"Our New Puppy\\" doesn't have much in the way of plot--will the new puppy be accepted or not by the older dog?--but what it lacks in fascinating events it more than makes up for in the way of gorgeous, glowing illustrations.  I don't know for certain, but I feel that Moser must work from photographs--the illustrations have a nearly photographic quality to them with all the best elements of that art form and none of the worst.  He does an especially fine job at giving the sundry cats and dogs in the book subtly evocative expressions of their own, and the little girls (Isabelle and Eliza) are rendered with the warmth only a loving grandfather could muster.  This is a wonderful treat for anyone bringing a new pet into a home that already had pets, and it's a must for Barry Moser fans.	2002-08-25

It begins with a grandfather telling his granddaughter and grandson a story from his childhood.  After just the first page, we are quickly whisked back to somewhere around the beginning decade of the 20th century.  The \\"potato man\\" in question is a man who drives a vegetable-and-fruit cart, and who is catcalled and jeered at by the neighborhood boys because he is missing an eye and thus has a face that looks somewhat like a potato.  It turns out that the grandfather telling the story is one of the boys who is rude to the potato man.  When push comes to shove, however, and the boy realizes that he should treat the potato man as kindly as he himself would want to be treated, the potato man forgives him without a second thought.  It's a powerful lesson for children.<br />Ted Lewin's illustrations are up to his usual sky-high standards.  You can practically hear horse's hooves clop-clopping through the city neighborhood as they land on the cobblestone roads.  You can almost smell the warm produce as it sits in the sun, and hear the hurdy-gurdy man as he cranks his instrument up to play \\"Pop Goes the Weasel.\\"  Lewin is a master, and he is in fine form here.	2002-08-25

Books	5	3	4	N	N	Perfectly captures the sights, smells, sounds of the fair	It's criminal that Ted Lewin's \\"Fair!\\" has only \\"limited availability.\\"  This book perfectly captures the sights, smells, and sounds of a fair.  The NEW YORK TIMES named \\"Fair!\\" one of the best illustrated books of 1997, and that's right on the money.<br />Lewin apparently used a fair in Clearfield, Pennsylvania to do his paintings, but truly, this could be a fair anywhere in the United States.  We see the roustabouts setting up rides, checking electrical connections, and hoisting enormous, lightbulb-laden ride signs high into the air.  Sweat glistens, the sun beats down mercilessly, muscles strain--Lewin captures the physicality of the scene as though he were merely snapping a photograph.  We then move on to the 4-H sheds, where youngsters prepare their sheep, cows, pigs, and goats for inspection.  The sunlight streams in from outside, lighting the leaves on the trees to a glowing citrus green, and picking up the gleam on the cows' coats.  Day moves inexorably into afternoon and then into night, complete with a luminous fireworks display and a walk along the midway.  <br />Lewin's painting skill is nothing short of astonishing.  These watercolors have all the richness and mood of the fair itself.  We are fortunate that he has chosen such a multi-faceted subject with which to bedazzle his readers.	2002-08-25

I am always so taken with his storytelling skills, not to mention the astonishing illustrations he does.<br />This is the tale of Abdul and his grandfather, Moroccans who spend their time sitting just outside the town of Fez, entertaining crowds with stories.  As they walk from home to their destination near the town gate, Abdul observes other citizens hard at work and he consistently notes that he and his grandfather have much better jobs than the poor folks who are either tanning leather or beating metal into bowls or weaving rugs.  They arrive, finally, are seated, and Abdul tosses a bird into the air--his grandfather's cue to launch into a magical story with the Arab version of \\"Once upon a time\\" (it translates to \\"There was, or there was not\\"--what a charming way to launch into a story!).<br />Lewin captures all the heat, the saturated color, the movement, and the light of Morocco in these amazingly detailed watercolors.  The book is a fortuitous dovetailing of excellent, absorbing story and a feast for the eyes.  Highly recommended to adults and children alike!	2002-08-25

But those who consider Wang to be little more than a dress designer--however talented a dress designer she may be--will be not only pleasantly surprised, but astonished at Wang's accomplishment in the form of this book.  \\"Vera Wang on Weddings\\" just may be the only wedding book any bride will ever need.  Clocking in at nearly 300 pages and a hefty 10\\"  by 13.5\\", this is a substantive book not only in size and weight, but in information as well.<br />Expecting Wang to help you out on choosing a gown?  She doesn't stop there.  She gives you the benefit of her vast wedding experience on topics ranging from choosing engagement and wedding bands to coordinating flowers with other decorative elements at the wedding and reception to wedding cakes to music to the formality inherent in wedding ceremonies held at different times of day and in different types of venues.  Her expertise is enormous and detailed, but she doesn't pelt you to death with bits of information--the lay-out is such that it's easy to pick and choose what you want to learn more about without being deluged with other information.<br />There is information here that I've never seen in another \\"bride guide.\\"  Sure, it's easy enough to find out all the different veil lengths if you want--ranging from fingertip to cathedral to royal and every length in between--but what other book shows you, in detail, the twenty-six (twenty-six!) different types of necklines?  Or the twenty-three different types of sleeves?  What other book takes into account different personal styles in such a clear-eyed manner (asking the reader if she is a modernist, a minimalist, a traditionalist, and so forth)?  Wang covers second-time brides, pregnant brides, military weddings, and even gives every bride permission to relax no matter what her age or any other status: \\"White is always appropriate.\\"  And so it is.<br />The book couldn't be handsomer.  Harper Collins did Wang proud by having art and design director Bridget de Socio in charge of the book.  It's clear that an enormous amount of thought and effort went into making \\"Vera Wang on Weddings\\" not only useful--first and foremost--but a feast for the eyes as well.  The paper is heavy and creamy--subtly echoing perhaps the duchesse satin of a bridal gown--interspersed with occasional sheer pages.  The sheer pages feature lovely photographs of all kinds of different items, from slender kid leather gloves to sparkling rings to butterflies and rose petals.  Through these photographs, you then see the next page of regular paper.  The effect is transforming, and subtly echoes the manner in which a sheer bridal veil helps put into motion the age-old metamorphosis from woman to bride.	2002-08-25

The gently repetitive text details her everyday life, from swimming in a swimming hole (even if there were snakes!) to taking a bath to drinking cocoa made by her grandmother.  Each page starts off with, \\"When I was young in the mountains . . . \\" By the final page, we see that not only did Ms. Rylant appreciate her low-tech, memory-making childhood, but she wouldn't have traded it for anything.<br />Diane Goode's softly colored illustrations beautifully dovetail with the text, whether she's showing a river baptism, a nighttime trip to the \\"johnny-house\\" after too much fried okra, or a stint at the water pump.  It's a lovely ode to the simple life, and to being happy with what you have instead of worrying about what you don't have.	2002-08-25

Kiddos who love car washes will get a kick out of the ride here, as the siblings in the back seat pretend that they are deep-sea adventurers.  But even kids who are spooked by going through the car wash will enjoy it, too, as it suggests a different attitude and a different approach for their next trip.<br />G. Brian Karas has done some remarkably imaginative illustrations here, incorporating paint, glass beads, strips of sponge and fabric, and so on to create a textural collage.  It's lots of fun, and perfectly complements the manner in which a car wash incorporates all different sounds, smells, and rhythms.	2002-08-25

We follow an unnamed little girl through her neighborhood as she looks for something beautiful as a teacher has instructed her to do.  What we see is litter, broken windows, scary graffiti, homeless people, and more.  But the little girl manages to find out from everyone she asks what they find beautiful around them.  She is variously given the examples of a fish sandwich, a jump rope, some apples at a fruit market, and even a smooth, heavy stone a neighbor carries for good luck.  The best and most beautiful example, though, comes from the little girl's mother--and her reply ends the book on a lovely note.<br />Chris Soentpiet's watercolor illustrations are nothing short of remarkable.  They are nearly photographic in their detail and lifelike aspect, and they give a visual rhythm to the text.  He is to be commended for his ability to combine both an unflinching look at a downtrodden neighborhood and examples of how we all can find beauty everyday, if we look hard enough.	2002-08-25

When they all happen upon a pool, the sons strip down and go skinny-dipping and have a wonderful time.  They toast marshmallows, gaze at the stars, and get a little bit spooked by weird noises in the night.  But what they really want to spend their time doing is climbing the waterfall which flows into their swimming hole.  The parents tell them it probably can't be done, but the boys are determined.  Sure enough, they make it to the top and take home a wonderful memory of having overcome something that seemed bigger than they could handle.<br />Jill Kastner's handsome painted illustrations beautifully enhance London's text.  She makes the boys' curiosity, healthy athleticism, and determination come through on each page.	2002-08-25

Still, a disappointing book by Hardy is worth ten by nearly anyone else, so let me explain.  The ending felt quite out of the blue and abrupt compared to the events leading up to it, yet in retrospect, it makes more and more sense.<br />The ending aside--where the oddness is confined to just the last two pages--this is a superb character study of five disparate main characters and a handful of minor characters.  Hardy is a master at imbuing each character with not only distinct personalities, but with the inconsistencies and flaws that make them leap, whole and warm-blooded, from the page.  His characters are never stock people; they always seem as though they are people you could (or do) actually know in your own life.<br />The primary character is Anne Garland, a lovely country village girl who is much sought after by three different local men.  These include Festus Derriman, a ne'er-do-well with a temper and a lust for his uncle's money; John Loveday, a soldier and the trumpet-major of the novel's title, who is the kindest, most patient character I believe I have ever seen in a novel; and John's younger brother Bob, who is a boisterous sailor with good intentions but a short attention span when it comes to the ladies.  The machinations by which these three seek to catch Anne's eye is endlessly inventive and endlessly interesting for the reader, and her varied reactions to their attentions is a marvel of observed detail and the inconsistency of human nature.  By turns hot and cold towards each of the men, Anne never seems shallow or thoughtless--merely human.  There is also another sharply etched female character, the actress Matilda Johnson, who appears only a couple of times, but who is the linchpin of much important action.<br />As always, Hardy likes to insert subtle humor into even the most serious ofsituations.  In detailing the village's concern about Napoleon (who is referred to frequently in the book by the derisive nickname &quot;Boney&quot;), Hardy writes:<br />Widow Garland's thoughts were those of the period.  &quot;Can it be the French?&quot; she said, arranging herself for the extremest form of consternation.  &quot;Can that arch-enemy of mankind have landed at last?&quot;  It should be stated that at this time there were two arch-enemies of mankind, Satan as usual, and Buonaparte, who had sprung up and eclipsed his elder rival altogether.  Mrs Garland alluded of couse to the junior gentleman.<br />You will be surprised, as I was, by the man with whom Anne Garland ends up.  Yet now, just a day or two after having finished the novel and having been almost affronted by the abruptness and seeming insuitability of the ending, my position has softened and I can see that Hardy was actually quite true to the characters, their motivations, and their choices--however inconsistent they may at first have seemed to the reader.  This is not by any means a great Thomas Hardy novel, but an average novel by Thomas Hardy is still a marvel of construction, of character, and of plot.	2002-08-24

I have always thought of Shel Silverstein as the American counterpart to England's Roald Dahl--someone who writes ostensibly for children much of the time, but whose worldview is dark, perhaps a little damp, and steeped in a winking cynicism.  Silverstein proves my point adeptly in the 1961 classic &quot;Uncle Shelby's ABZ,&quot; a loopy uproar of a book that should never, NEVER be given to young children.  You will, however, want to get a copy for every adult you're fond of who doesn't already own a copy.<br />As Silverstein explains in the foreword (done here, as throughout the book, in his own handwriting), he has thought and thought about children and as he wasn't blessed with children of his own, he has come up with this &quot;primer&quot; for all children.  The book opens with a wee poem:<br />O child learn your ABZ's<BR>And memorize them well<BR>And you shall learn to talk and think<BR>And read and write and spel.<br />That ought to give you an idea of what's to come.  Silverstein meticulously addresses every letter in the alphabet, descending further and further as he does into a swirling pit of black humor.  He starts off, of course, with &quot;A,&quot; writing with great jollity about how many green apples he thinks the reader can eat (everything is addressed directly TO the reader, as though the reader is a child, making the text all the more seductive).  &quot;E&quot; is a hoot:<br />E is for egg.<BR>See the egg.<BR>The egg is full of slimey goosey white stuff and icky yellow stuff.<BR>Do you like to eat eggs?<BR>E is also for Ernie.<BR>Ernie is the genie who lives in the ceiling.<BR>Ernie loves eggs.<BR>Take a nice fresh egg and throw it as high as you can and yell &quot;Catch, Ernie!  Catch the egg!&quot;<BR>And Ernie will reach down and catch the egg.<br />Silverstein's humor is subversive, to say the least.  One page has a coupon, which Silverstein accompanies with the following text:<br />Kids!  Clip out this certificate and bring it to your friendly neighborhood grocer and he will give you, absolutely free . . . A REAL LIVE PONY!<br />I have seen adults absolutely dissolve off their chairs with helpless laughter on reading &quot;Uncle Shelby's ABZ.&quot;  It wickedly plays off every insecurity and worry and doomed hope that any child secretly entertains, and it does so with a ruthlessness that's mighty to behold.  This is highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended for any adult.	2002-08-23

You have the well-oiled engine which begins running from the moment you open up Patricia Carlon's superb 1965 thriller &quot;The Unquiet Night&quot; (only published in the U.S. in the last few years).  Carlon, an Australian writer, has published only a handful of books and this is the only one I've read thus far--but it's made me want to pick up her other work as well.  <br />The tale is set in Australia.  Rachel Penghill is the independent young jeweler, feeling a bit at odds with her boyfriend, trying to make a go of her business, and spending time with her nine-year old niece to try to take her mind off her own problems.  Thus is the action set into place (after a very scary first chapter which actually involves another female character--can't say much more without giving too much away).  Martin Deeford, the off-balance, enraged man Rachel has the misfortune to meet up with, is convinced of something about Rachel which actually turns out to be untrue--but he doesn't know this yet, and his beliefs about Rachel are enough to send him stalking and finally finding her.  <br />I can say little else without giving away too much of the plot, and I will say that I found the ending unsatisfactory.  Without going into detail to ruin it for those who haven't read &quot;The Unquiet Night,&quot; the ending somehow struck a false note for me--as though Carlon had simply and suddenly tired of the book and decided to slam the covers shut.  Other than that though--and it is a fairly minor quibble--this is a taut and worthy thriller.	2002-08-22

Even today, I remember his helpless laughter as he sat and read the book in just one or two gulps--he could scarcely put it down and got red-faced with the giggles dozens of times throughout the book. As an adult, I bought myself a copy, and it remains a treasured book. Even those who have no prep school experience will enjoy these tales of boys being boys and working so hard to avoid working that they end up working even harder than they would have had they done things by the book.<br />My all-time favorite piece in the book remains \\"The Great Pancake Record,\\" in which shrimpy little Johnnie Smeed is found to have the most enormous appetite known to anyone at Lawrenceville--and is therefore put on display as the man who can take all comers in an ongoing pancake-eating contest at a local restaurant called Conover's. Of course he is misjudged by his slight physical appearance:<br />\\"Mr. Conover,\\" said Hickey, in the quality of manager, \\"we're going after that pancake record.\\"<br />\\"Mr. Wilkins' record?\\" said Conover, seeking vainly the champion in the crowd.<br />\\"No--after that record of YOURS,\\" answered Hickey. \\"Thirty-two pancakes--we're here to get free pancakes today--that's what we're here for.\\"<br />\\"So, boys, so,\\" said Conover, smiling pleasantly; \\"and you want to begin now?\\"<br />\\"Right off the bat.\\"<br />\\"Well, where is he?\\"<br />Little Smeed, famished to the point of tears, was thrust forward. Conover, who was expecting something along the lines of a buffalo, smiled confidently. \\"So, boys, so,\\" he said, leading the way with alacrity. \\"I guess we're ready, too.\\"<br />\\"Thirty-two pancakes, Conover--and we get 'em free!\\"<br />\\"That's right,\\" answered Conover, secure in his knowledge of boyish capacity. \\"If that little boy there can eat thirty-two, I'll make them all day free to the school. That's what I said, and what I say goes--and that's what I say now.\\"<br />This is my favorite of the stories, but they're ALL this good. You just can't beat Owen Johnson for understanding boys and their motives and ways, and you certainly can't beat him for giving you something to wonderful to laugh at while never making the boys seem ridiculous.	2002-08-21

Ellison's facility with giving different scenes different levels of meaning is comparable to the great Herman Melville, who constructed \\"Moby Dick\\" in much the same manner.<br />Ellison makes his point about the invisibility of blacks in America before you even open the book; the title itself has no article, no \\"An Invisible Man\\" or \\"The Invisible Man,\\" but simply and starkly, \\"Invisible Man.\\"  This simple ommission (or commission, depending on how you want to approach it) sets the story afloat by subtly establishing that the main character is seen to be almost suspended in the ether, noticed not at all by whites until they attribute to him whatever prejudice, odd ideas, or assumptions they have about the black race.<br />In the prologue, Ellison lets his hero (anti-hero?) ramble on and on about different experiences, not telling us directly who he is and what he's like, but leaving it to the reader to do the work of harvesting from this field of memory what impressions he or she can about the character.  The story begins with the hero giving a tour of the local county to an important visitor from the college the hero attends.  A harrowing firsthand account of incest follows--one of the tensest, most intense scenes I've ever read in any book--and somewhat thereafter, the hero is forced to leave the college.  He drifts hither and yon, from country to city, from friend to friend, never quite getting his bearings and not really understanding why.  When he finally hooks up with a political group towards the end of the book, you find yourself relieved that he's found some purpose--but even this turns out to be ominous and unfortunate.<br />It's a testament to Ellison's talent (and his willpower) that he ends the book on a hanging note.  We don't know what will happen next--we have no sense of it at all.  And isn't that entirely Ellison's point?'t know what will happen next--we have no sense of it at all.  And isn't that entirely Ellison's point?	2002-08-21
US	47346111	RX62644I9DU5I	0316291161	474944569	The French Lieutenant's Woman	Books	5	6	7	N	N	As clearly a masterpiece today as when it was published	John Fowles' &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot; is not only a masterpiece, it's an UNUSUAL masterpiece.  Fowles takes the story of a mysterious, stubborn woman who clings almost proudly to her shame much in the same way that Hester Prynne does in &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;--yet it turns out that there is, after all, no actual reason for shame.  But to Sarah Woodruff, the woman in question, shame equals freedom: freedom from constraints both social and emotional.<br />Sarah Woodruff is as full-blooded and full-bodied a literary invention as any character of the 20th century canon, yet she retains a sense of mystery which is absolutely essential.  It is for this sense she projects of being impossible to know that she becomes impossibly alluring to Charles Smithson, a wealthy, not-bad-looking, touchingly innocent gentleman who thinks of himself as a man of the world.  The action of the book is propelled forward by the attraction Sarah holds for Charles, especially as it is forbidden (he is engaged to marry someone else).  <br />I will mention the film here only because it is probably the only film I've ever seen that actually adds something to the book.  In the film (made in 1983, if memory serves), Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons play Sarah and Charles, but they ALSO play their modern-day counterparts, making it a movie within a movie.  This layers on further depth and further despair for Charles and lends an unexpected richness to the Victorian portion of the film.  Although &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot; stands staunchly on its own, I highly recommend seeing the movie once you've read the book--if only for the delicious sense of something wonderful having been expanded even further beyond its bookish boundaries.	2002-08-21

The title really ought to be amended to read &quot;BRITISH Royalty in Vogue,&quot; as the English royals take up by far the majority of the pages, but that's a small quibble.  <br />The photographs certainly are superb--and the reason most folks would be interested in seeing this book--but the text is also marvelously immediate and almost breathless in places.  There are firsthand accounts of the rehearsal for George's coronation in 1937, and Cecil Beaton's notes from the abbey regarding Elizabeth's coronation in 1953.  These have such a &quot;you are there&quot; flavor that one can almost picture the scene without the aid of the photographs which accompany the text.  Beaton writes:<br />&quot;The massed Peeresses, an inconceivably wonderful sight . . . Their foam-white ermine and dark red velvet looking like a parterre of auricula-eyed Sweet William . . . Their decolletage the palest pampered pink . . . Among them, undoubtedly the most beautiful is the young Duchess of Devonshire, wearing the original eighteenth-century coronation robe belonging to Georgiana, Gainsborough's Duchess . . . &quot;<br />The photographs themselves are beautiful, of course, but let us remember that this is VOGUE and that beauty in the subjects was also of paramount importance.  Princess Marina of Greece and Lady Alice Montagu-Douglas-Scott appear in several photographs, looking almost as classically beautiful as Roman busts.  Of course there are ample photographs of the lovely Diana, Princess of Wales, and her country-girl-pretty counterpart Sarah Ferguson--in their wedding gowns and in other outfits.  And lastly, there are many, many photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor--looking, always, a little tired, very brittle, very wary.  It's a fascinating glimpse into a world the vast majority of us know absolutely nothing about.	2002-08-21

In \\"Death by Chocolate Cakes,\\" he provides recipes for mind-blowing chocolate experiences from Chocolate Peanut Butter Some More (Please) Cakes and Chocolate Chip Goober Gobble Cupcakes to Chocolate Peanut Root Beer Rumble to Cocoa Skillet Cake with Tequila Sunshine Salsa.  The range of his imagination is breathtaking, and we should count ourselves lucky that the reach of his culinary prowess is just as broad.  These recipes are wonderful!<br />Those who like to wing it in the kitchen may chafe a little under Desaulniers' firm touch--the recipes are nothing if not detailed, but that's because Desaulniers has the experience and expertise to tell you exactly how to do it.  If you follow his directions, you can plan on spending a little longer in the kitchen than usual--but you can also bank on the fact that your family and friends will be first amazed, then delighted that you prepared anything from this book.  Don't worry if you're not an incredibly experienced baker.  You'll look at the level of detail involved and be intimidated at first, but in fact, Desaulniers' recipes are practically custom-made for the baker who likes a lot of hand-holding.  He guides you from one step to the next with assurance and grace.<br />Desaulniers knows that we eat with our eyes before we eat with our mouths, and he is rightly known for preparing desserts which are as magnificent to gaze upon as they are to eat.  He is aided greatly in this by the evocative photography of Duane Winfield, who captures with loving detail every chocolate cake oozing chocolate ganache, every glossy icing, and every delicious crumb of chocolate goodness.<br />Recipes I highly recommend include the Chocolate Heart of Darkness Cakes (in which you insert frozen chocolate truffles into cake batter just before baking--soooooooo amazingly good you just have to try it!) and the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Cakes (which I made with my8-year old son and 5-year old daughter, who loved these as much as my husband and I did!).  This book's a definite keeper!	2002-08-20

He knows whereof he speaks, so listen up! It's important to read \\"Notes from Ganache Hill,\\" which opens the book, and which has Desaulniers giving us the benefit of his experience on everything from butter vs. margarine (use butter, please, preferably unsalted), ovens and other equipment, and, of course, the different types of chocolate. <br />I love Desaulniers' sense of humor and imagination in naming his recipes: Chocolate Crack-Ups, Franny's Big Bottom Pies, Black Magic Cookies with Blackstrap Icing, and (my favorite) Successively Excessively Crunchy Peanut Butter Brownies. I can highly recommend my most favorite of all recipes in the book: the Black Gold Cookies. These have something like four teaspoons of chocolate for every 1 teaspoon of flour in the recipe! They are divinely, richly chocolatey and people sort of lose their minds eating them, recovering later only to whimper, \\"Wh--what happened? Where am I?\\" That's the sort of effect a Desaulniers dessert recipe will have on you.	2002-08-20

If you need a special occasion dessert--perhaps one to propose by?  perhaps one to celebrate the birth of a child?--you can't go wrong choosing one of Desaulniers' desserts from \\"Desserts to Die For.\\"<br />Desaulniers encourages \\"mise en place\\" (the French culinary term for \\"everything in its place,\\" or setting out all ingredients before ever beginning the recipe), which I admire, and he instructs his readers--kindly, politely, but firmly--to read each recipe through from start to finish before beginning.  This is good advice in any cooking situation, but it makes strong sense with Desaulniers' recipes, which tend to be extremely detailed.  Some cooks might find this annoying, but there are others--myself among them--who understand that this concentration on every little tiny thing means that Desaulniers recognizes the difference between a pretty good dessert and a great one.  And he wants you to prepare nothing but great ones!<br />Desaulniers' personal dessert philosophy may be best expressed by the W. Somerset Maugham quotation with which he heads the introduction: \\"Excess on occasion is exhilarating; it keeps moderation from becoming a habit.\\"  And are these recipes excessive in nearly every way!  Desaulniers wisely avoids giving calorie counts, fat content, etc. for each recipe, and concentrates instead on seducing his readers into wanting to make each and every dessert so sumptuously photographed by Michael Grand.  The names are rich and evocative as the dishes themselves--Tuxedo Truffle Torte, Chocolate Voodoo Cake, Mocha Almond Praline Snap, Chocolate Caramel Hazelnut Damnation, Trick or Treat Ice Cream, \\"24\\" Carrot Cake, Wild Orchid, Chocolate Exquisite Pain (yikes!), Chocolate Resurrection, and White Chocolate Lullaby are but a few of the many tempting offerings herein.  <br />There are many non-chocolate desserts inthis book, but it's clear that Desaulniers is most excited by chocolate anything--it sets his heart to soaring, his brain to feverish activity, and his hands to creating something wonderful for all of us to try.	2002-08-20
US	47346111	R287O1HK0A8O7R	0811827178	926981453	Tiara	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Another Scarisbrick examination of gorgeous jewels	As I am a big fan of Diana Scarisbrick's &quot;Ancestral Jewels,&quot; I was excited to see &quot;Tiara.&quot;  Although she does a masterful job giving the reader a miniature history of the tiara (especially in its different European forms), I must admit to disappointment at the layout of the book.  Dozens upon dozens of photographs of women wearing their tiaras are literally about 1&quot; square (sometimes less, sometimes ever so slightly more).  There is so much white space surrounding these photographs that I have to wonder if perhaps there was a misunderstanding among author, editor, and designer.  <br />The latter half of the book fares better, with full-page color photographs of sumptuous tiaras.  Scarisbrick shows us mourning tiaras (often constructed of iron, though just as lacy and lovely as their platinum and gold counterparts), brushed gold tiaras, and tairas which break down into sundry bracelets, necklaces, brooches, and stomachers.  It's especially fun to see the different tiaras worn for the coronations of King George of England in 1937 and Queen Elizabeth of England in 1953.  There is even a photo of Rose Kennedy, whose husband Joe was America's Ambassador to England in the years leading up to World War II.  Mrs. Kennedy is pictured in a satin evening gown, wearing a tiara borrowed from a sympathetic English noble friend.  An excerpt from her 1974 autobiography notes that when she wore the tiara to court &quot; . . . my children were quite impressed!&quot;  One can only imagine.<br />The range and artistry of the designs is really quite breathtaking.  It's just too bad that more care wasn't taken to enlarge the photographs of the women wearing their tiaras, as there's so much interesting interplay of fashion and tradition there.	2002-08-20

Normally I shy away from cookbooks that are so narrowly focused, but as I like Haedrich's relaxed writing style and because apple pies are such wonderfully American desserts, I decided to take a look inside.  I was astounded by what I saw.<br />Haedrich has delivered here nearly every conceivable apple pie permutation you can imagine.  The purely apple ones include Baked Apple Dumpling Pie, Grated Apple Pie, Apple Cobbler Pie, Apple Upside-Down Pan Pie, Shaker Boiled Apple Cider Pie, and dozens of others.  Then there are the pies which fudge the title a little bit and branch out into other fruits: Apple Cherry Pie with Coconut Almond Crumb Topping, Apple and Champagne Grape Pie, several pies combining apples and tomatoes (yes!), Cottage Cheese-Cheesecake Apple Pie, Apple Pie with Prunes and Port, and more.  Haedrich even gives us the official recipe for New York State's Official Apple Pie (using McIntosh apples, an apple most knowing bakers would shy away from for use in a pie, as it gets smushy--but he says it's delicious in this particular recipe).<br />Of course Haedrich also supplies his readers with a broad variety of different pie crusts and gives, as always, all manner of helpful hints based on his extensive home-baking experience.  He is a kindly and knowledgeable guide, and his avuncular voice is particularly well-suited to this book.  The book boasts an attractive and easy-to-read graphic design (although I would prefer that the color used for headers and sidebars were something other than red, which can be hard on the eyes, it DOES make sense in a book about apples!).	2002-08-19
US	47346111	R21I0AR7MX3H98	0688044026	857459596	The Cake Bible	Books	5	69	77	N	Y	A well-rounded, well-researched, wonderful classic	Rose Levy Beranbaum's &quot;The Cake Bible&quot; has justifiably become a classic in the many years since its original publication in 1988.  Aside from bearing the seal of approval of the IACP (International Association of Culinary Professionals, which awarded the book its &quot;Cookbook of the Year&quot; prize in 1988), take a look at the fact that this book is still not only in print--it's in print in hardcover!  That says a great deal about the value and information the book provides.<br />I can attest personally to the fact that the recipes WORK.  This is the number one test for any cookbook, yet it's astonishing to me how many recipes DON'T work--either because of unclear or poorly worded directions, or because of lack of thorough testing on the part of the author.  I have never yet made anything from this book with which I was disappointed, and have made a number of recipes which have entered the hallowed pantheon of family favorites.  Beranbaum's White Velvet Butter Cake has become a de rigeur choice for birthday, confirmation, and other special occasion cakes--it's a fine-crumbed, velvety, melt-in-your-mouth cake that's like the best wedding cake or petit four you've ever put in your mouth.  And the Neoclassic Buttercream gives you a meltingly delicious frosting that's the color of cheesecake--richly ivory and silken smooth.<br />Beranbaum is a companionable writer--her essay on &quot;My Brother's Wedding Cake, or the Snowstorm of 1983&quot; has become something of a Murphy's Law baking classic--and she's a learned and intelligent teacher.  This book was the first to introduce me to the novel idea of weighing ingredients, rather than measuring them by volume.  The result is much greater accuracy, which in turn gives you a much higher chance of turning out stellar baking results.  I bought a scale shortly after receiving this book as a gift for my birthday in 1989, and have never looked back.  In fact, when I wrote my own culinary newsletter from 1993 to 2000, I usually did all the recipes giving both weights AND measures, trying to encourage my readers to try the weighing method.  Once you try it, you'll never go back.<br />The photography is gorgeous (although I have always wished there were more of it!).  The cakes fairly gleam with rich color--you can practically taste them just looking at the photographs (check out especially the handsome Strawberry Maria, named for editor Maria Guarnaschelli, and the dramatically decorated Art Deco cake).<br />In addition to the cake and icing recipes, there is worthy advice on everything from tempering chocolate to creating three-dimensional cake decorations to unusual sources for cake and cake-decorating supplies.  The bottom line is that any home cook can create gorgeous, sumptuous, outstandingly delicious cakes from Beranbaum's book--and isn't that what a cake bible should be all about?	2002-08-14

My best friend gave me a copy years ago for my birthday, and it is probably one of the most-used cookbooks of the many that crowd my pantry shelf.<br />The recipes are, as you might imagine, simple, delicious, and easy to prepare.  Yet there's none of the frantic &quot;Dinner in Ten Minutes!&quot; or &quot;Gourmet Meals from Just Five Ingredients!&quot; tone that you see in cookbooks that are trying to make a fabulous meal appear on the table in less time than it takes to read this review.  Cunningham slyly makes most of the recipes easy and with minimal ingredients, but she lets you discover this happy news on your own.  Her emphasis is, instead, on taste and freshness of ingredients.  <br />The Crabcakes are absolutely delicious and the soul of simplicity.  The Celery Soup is a revelation, and a dish in which celery gets to stand up and take a bow instead of being an afterthought as it is in so many other recipes.  Speed Steaks is an intriguing idea--you slice the steaks very thin, freeze them, and then fry them while still frozen.  The result is a beautifully cooked steak with a lovely pink center.  And now that Fish Tacos are all the culinary rage, let it be known that Marion Cunningham first featured them in a cookbook way back in 1992!<br />Cunningham extols the virtues of calmness and solitude at supper.  In fact, she writes, &quot;Sometimes eating supper alone feels private, quiet, and blessedly liberating.  You may eat anything you want; you needn't be conventional.  I liked a baked potato with olive oil and coarse salt and pepper followed by vanilla ice cream, which proves to me that money doesn't buy a good meal.  One night not long ago I had freshly baked cookies and milk, and found that uplifting.&quot;  <br />Donnie Cameron's handsome, spare line drawings do much to underscore the overall feeling of calmness and simplicity that Cunningham gives the reader.  It's a nice match of author and illustrator, as each heightens the impact of the other's work.  This really is a valuable kitchen friend, whether you live alone or cook for a crowd each night.	2002-08-14

It bears the same homey, happy tone and the same simple, yummy recipes.  Most importantly of all, the contents are aimed squarely at the real cooks in the world--the folks food writers Jane and Michael Stern term on the back cover &quot;not trend-setters or celebrity chefs, but real people who worry about making tender pork chops for supper and moist chocolate cake for birthday parties.&quot;<br />You never know what you're going to find here, as many of the recipes were shared by readers of Bannister's newsletter.  So prepare yourself for the intriguing idea of cooking fish on the top rack of the dishwasher (&quot;all the cycles!&quot;) as detailed on p. 180, or for the &quot;you can't have too much stuff!&quot; tenet in evidence in such recipes as Pear Upside-Down Chocolate Cake and One-of-Each Soup.  But it's all good, and many of the recipes are accompanied with testimonials from Bannister's loyal audience who proclaim just about every recipe to be nothing short of mouth-watering.<br />Bannister's own lean line drawings illustrate the book, and they are as much a pleasure to look at as the recipes are to make.  This is a winner for any home cook.	2002-08-14

William Steig's \\"The Toy Brother\\" takes us back to medieval England, where brothers Charles and Yorick spend their time in the time-honored way of figuring out ways to annoy each other (some things never change).  When one of them gets into their father's magic potions, all heck breaks loose and there are problems a-plenty--compounded by the fact that their parents are away for several days at a family wedding.<br />The brothers come to an understanding on their own--a nice touch--not with the help of their parents or any other characters.  But of course, it's all even better once their parents arrive home.<br />One of my very favorite things about William Steig's books--aside from, well, everything--is that he treats kids like smart people.  That's different from treating them like grown-ups, which he doesn't do--but he uses uncommon words and phrases with great abandon, figuring that what kids don't pick up from context they can jolly well look up in a dictionary.  Bully for him!  The result is a book that has zing, and the usual terrific Steig illustrations.  So much fun, whether or not the child you're reading to has an annoying brother!	2002-08-12

Like all Chris van Allsburg's books, \\"Bad Day at Riverbend\\" shows an astonishing blend of imagination and talent.  The good folks of the tiny western town called Riverbend start to realize that there are all sorts of strange things happening--and no one can explain them.  People are afraid.  People are uneasy.  People turn to the town's sherriff for help.<br />Adults will tune in right away to what's going on, but what fun to see understanding dawn on a child's face when they realize where the light and color are coming from--it's positively magical to watch.<br />Van Allsburg employs his usual stellar artistic talent in an unusual way here, and the end result is captivating.  There is a sense of unease here, a discomfiting sense of mystery that pervades all Van Allsburg's work, and it works wonderfully well here to heighten the sense of suspense.  Much to be admired!	2002-08-11

But after his teacher has had an opportunity to show him around the different classroom areas (art, science, reading, math, and so on), Tim finds that he's more than ready for kindergarten--he's positively excited about it.<br />Rockwell's simplistic paintings accompany concise text and they complement each other beautifully.  The colors are strong and clear, the details just right, and the movement from one classroom area to another helps to mimic what an actual kindergarten school day will be like.  Just right for young kiddos who may harbor a little nervousness about that all-important first day!	2002-08-11

This book is PACKED with not just information, but USABLE information that can make a real difference in your eating habits and in turn, your energy level.<br />One of the best things Borushek does here is give detailed, concise calorie/fat/carb counts for foods from over one hundred different chain or nationally known restaurants.

Even to this day, William Steig's superbly offbeat text (he describes harmonica-playing as \\"zeezling and zoozling\\" and when a character nods off, he later \\"nods back on again\\") is something to behold.<br />Steig resolutely refuses to talk down to kids.  He throws in the occasional weird word, odd phrase, or elaborately worded paragraph just to keep kids (and their parents) on their toes. The enviable result is that his book--both this and others--is utterly memorable and stands apart from the masses of touchy-feely children's books out there.<br />Zeke Pippin is a pig whose life is changed by a harmonica he finds.  After numerous adventures, narrow escapes, and a great number of lovingly-detailed meals and snacks (he is, after all, a pig), Zeke Pippin becomes a hero in his town and a friend to sick children.  This combination of Horatio Alger pluck and Robert Louis Stevenson excitement is winning and rewards frequent reading.  Steig's inimitable illustrations are just as terrific as the text.  He manages to convey more with just a few watercolor tints and a wobbly black line than other artists do with a great deal more equipment (and less talent).  Rewarding time and time again.	2002-08-11

Let's see, there's Wizzil the witch, DeWitt Frimp, Florence and Fred Frimp (try saying THAT three times fast!), and of course, a parrot named Beatrice.  It's a happy combination of offbeat, cranky text and the loosey-goosey pen-and-ink illustrations of the inimitable Quentin Blake.  Too good to miss!	2002-08-11

No!\\"  Although the text displays her usual empathy with young children--it's all about a little boy's really, really bad day and what his mom does to help make things better--the illustrations are most disappointing.  The colors are strong and cheerful, but the composition and overall artistic expertise shown via these pictures is really just flat-out bad.  They are not crude and charming in the way that some children's books pictures can be--that is, in the way that a technically proficient artist will show his or her ability to illustrate well while still maintaining a childlike quality to the work.  No, these are just below-average pictures.  It's too bad, because the text really works very well.	2002-08-11

Nothing much happens to Olivia--a little tiny girl pig who seems to live both right next to an idyllic sandy beach and in New York City--yet she is such an enjoyable character study that the lack of plot and eventfulness is of no consequence.<br />Using an extremely spare palette of only black, white, and a sumptuous lipstick red, Falconer, renders Olivia with just a few swift lines and smudges, yet she is indelible and memorable.  She is by turns snooty, curious, stubborn, exasperated, mischievous, cranky, and more.  She is, in short, every little girl (indeed, every child) and grabs our hearts because she appears as a delicate little porker instead of a human.  Somehow, that elevates Olivia out of the realm of the ordinary.  Thank you, Ian Falconer!	2002-08-11

The text focuses on the constant maneuvering that has to be done by different fish in order to stay alive--both in terms of feeding themselves and in terms of avoiding becoming some other fish's meal!  It's not too scary for even little kids, but does matter-of-factly present the realities of the food chain under the waves.<br />The illustrations are a charming mix of painting and rubber stamping.

The toddler is rendered realistically, and the otters are shown sleek and lithe as they would be in real life--but everything has a moonglow cast to it, and that makes this book's pictures utterly and completely enchanting.  A wonderful bedtime story, especially on a moonlit night!	2002-08-08

His concise and accurate text is amply matched by Paul Rocheleau's handsome photographs.<br />There is so much to learn, even for amateur students of American architectural history.  We hear about Palladio, Robert Adam, Christopher Wren and others who influenced the American Federal style, but we also learn what was going on in the American colonies in a religious, economic, and legal sense--all of which helped to affect the shape and style of American architectural and decorative tastes.<br />One of the most interesting things is learning how American craftsmen, builders and architects (many of whom were slaves) were influenced by the latest European styles.  American styles in everything, from dress to furniture to homes, tended to be more plainspoken and stripped down to the bare essentials than were their European counterparts.<br />This is an absolutely fascinating read, and a visual treat for anyone who is even remotely interested in the American Federal style.	2002-08-08

Determined to take anything back to France that will emphasize his strength, he snaps up the croc and deposits him in a cage in gay Paree!  The crocodile, discomfited at first, soon finds that Parisian life agrees with him handsomely.  He's the toast of the social set, who all begin doing crocodile-inspired dances.  But when the glare of newfound fame wears off and when the local chefs begin to eye him as inspiration for a crocodile-filled pie, our croc hero turns the tables on the social set, with the consequences you might expect.<br />Fred Marcellino invests his crocodile with all sorts of endearing qualities.  What an expressive face--and such facile body language!  He is, by turns, shy, enraged, lazy, embarrassed, and more.  This is the most emotionally available crocodile you'll ever see in a children's book.  And the ending is perfectly in keeping with the crocodile's basic nature.  Lots of fun for children, and sophisticated enough to keep the parents equally entertained.	2002-08-08

Williams' \\"More More More Said the Baby\\" is a modern-day classic.  Given as a baby gift to our now-much-older son, this instantly became a family favorite.  It fairly radiates joy, both via the simple text--which centers on the deliciousness of hugging, kissing, cuddling, roughhousing, and tickling--and via the sumptuous pictures.  <br />Williams has done something transformative here with the illustrations, making everyday scenes into modern Rousseau sequences--there is a wildness and an energy and a saturation of delicious color that call to mind some of the French master's more wild scenes (not to mention Gauguin and van Gogh's juicy color choices).  Both a treat to look at and a pleasure to read!	2002-08-08

It's perfect for any little girl (or boy, as boys are shown herein as well) who dreams of becoming a dancer.<br />Rachel Isadora, the author and illustrator, is a former ballerina herself and she graciously lets us into this magical world.  Lili and her friends are shown getting ready to go onstage to perform in \\"The Nutcracker\\"--we see them stretching, getting into costumes and make-up, waiting with baited breath for their cues, and so on.  What I like best about the book is that Isadora shows us the pixie dust and the magic along with all the incredible hard work that goes into not only being a ballerina, but putting on a ballet for the public.  The teacher, costume mistress, stage manager, and prima ballerina are all shown doing their disparate jobs.  We see that creating this dream of a ballet takes the commitment and cooperation of a great many people.	2002-08-07

Elffers, a Dutchman, has a typically European flair for the dramatic and shows it off to great effect with the fruits and vegetables he chooses to showcase in this marvelous book.<br />Picture, if you will, a wee family of bears carved out of zucchini--or a pensive carrot couple glancing askance at each other--or a shy banana. Crazy as it sounds, these things are not only possible but positively enchanting. Elffers manages to give each little edible face some human expression so that the photographs seem to show us not something we might find on our salad plate (or in our fruit bowl) but something we might see across the breakfast table as we look at our spouse or children.<br />Elffers's sense of humor and inventiveness is captivating. Highly recommended for anyone who dislikes eating their vegetables--they just might enjoy gazing at their vegetables instead, if Elffers is in charge!	2002-08-07

All is forgiven, and Mama Elephant lets Baby be himself.<br />The Petershams' illustrations are even better than the sweet text.

Scarisbrick doesn't limit herself to the typical earrings, necklaces, tiaras, and so on--there are bejeweled ceremonial swords, stomachers, chatelaines, cups and boxes, and more.<br />One of Scarisbrick's real accomplishments is to juxtapose photographs of jewelry alone with a photograph of the jewelry being worn in an oil portrait, or showing a piece being worn first as a head ornament and then later as a necklace (a common practice with tiaras, which could often be broken down into smaller parts and used as earrings, brooches, and so on).  <br />The jewels are fantastic, as is the photography.  Although I would have preferred that more of the photographs were in color, that's a small quibble when even the black-and-white pictures are so crisp and filled with telling detail.  Beyond this, Scarisbrick is to be commended for providing a concise, accurate, and broad overview of British jewelry history.  The book is eminently readable, and the pictures are fascinating.<br />One of the most fascinating parts of the book is the appendix, tellingly entitled \\"Where Are They Now?  Dispersal, Transformation, and Theft.\\"  Here Scarisbrick delves into the sometimes shady, sometimes ignoble histories and reputations of dozens of gem-encrusted objects.  She quotes here from Anthony Trollope's peerless novel \\"The Eustace Diamonds\\" when she writes: \\" . . . family treasures were preserved 'not so much for the protection of property but for the more picturesque idea of maintaining chivalric associations.  Heirlooms have become so, not that future owners of them may be assured of so much wealth whatever the value of the things so settled may be--but that the son or grandson may enjoy the satisfaction of saying my father or grandfather or ancestor sat in that chair or looked as he now looks in that picture or was graced by wearing on his breast that very ornament which you see lying beneath the glass.' \\"  <br />Scarisbrick understands, as did Trollope, how the aristocracy works and how it clings to the thought of itself as being somehow better than the rest of the world.  Scarisbrick's accomplishment here is to show us a history of a rarefied group of people through the splendid adornments chosen by its very privileged members.	2002-08-06

A young Parisian brother and sister set out to make their mama's birthday absolutely perfect, but run into bits of trouble along the way.  When they finally show up at home with their gift, it turns out to incorporate all the trouble they ran into in putting it together--but in a most charming and unusual way.  I don't want to say anything more detailed or I'll give it away!<br />Not only is the story charming (with all loose strings nicely tied up by the end), but the illustrations are up to Goode's usual high standards.  The coloring is soft and washed-looking.  The story is set in perhaps the 1920s or 1930s in Paris, with all the women having sleek, marcelled hair, fur stoles, and ghillie shoes--and the men sporting dapper moustaches, trim suits, and perfectly manicured hands.  It's a visual treat to watch the children bounce from store to store, taking in all the undeniably French atmosphere, made vivid and real-yet-idealized through Goode's luscious pictures.	2002-08-05

I'll be perfectly frank in admitting that I bought the book purely to drool over the photographs (which are sumptuous).  And yet without intending to be educated, I ended up learning a great deal from Munn's concise and accurate text.<br />Munn has served as the jewelry consultant and appraiser for the BBC version of \\"Antiques Roadshow\\" for some years, and his expertise is immediately evident in \\"Tiaras.\\"  He gives a detailed-but-never-overwhelming history of these crown-like adornments, from ancient Egypt and Rome (where they began as wreaths of foliage worn by nobility) all the way through the 20th century.<br />You would think that only bejewelled tiaras would be represented here, but this is not the case.  Of course there are magnificent examples in all manner of precious metals and faceted gemstones, but there is also a variety of unusual pieces, such as . . .<br />. . . a black-and-white banded agate tiara designed specifically for use when the wearer is in mourning;<br />. . . an improbably lovely washed beechwood (yes, wood!) tiara designed by Queen Elizabeth's nephew, Viscount Linley, a famed furniture designer, and modeled here by his lovely wife;<br />. . . a rock-crystal tiara hand-engraved with Russian arabesques and set with a shimmering array of rose-cut and brilliant diamonds;<br />. . . a foliate-and-floral tiara in which the three-dimensional elements decorating the piece are set \\"en tremblant,\\" meaning that they quiver as though alive with every subtle movement of the wearer's head;<br />. . . a French Art Nouveau tiara hand-carved from cow horn and set with glowing moonstones to resemble a thickly forested grove thronged with, perhaps, fireflies;<br />You will learn all sorts of wonderful things here, such as the impact of Art Nouveau on the formerly always-symmetrical tiara form; the influence of Art Deco in bringing the naturalistic Art Nouveau influence back intoline with the advances of the Machine Age; the ability of many tiaras to be taken apart and broken down into necklaces, bracelets, and brooches; and the impact upon tiaras of the pendulum of fashion.<br />The photographs are really quite something to behold.  The gemstones are fiery and brilliant, casting off every bit of light they catch.  The pictures are crisply detailed and utterly saturated with color.  The tiaras are shown both on their own and on the heads of some of their lucky owners.  The book is an utter delight.	2002-08-05

When his mother buys him a dog for his birthday, however, Tommy starts to come out of his shell.  Roly (as he names the dog) becomes Tommy's surrogate and Tommy starts to comfort the dog for fears he himself previously required comfort for (bad syntax, but you get my point!).  The effect is that Tommy becomes braver, more daring, and more relaxed in his environment.<br />Not until the last page do we see that Roly isn't really who we thought he was--but that's OK, because he's done his job so capably.  Klaus Baumgart's illustrations are winningly soft and rounded, and the colors are lovely.	2002-08-04

The book is illustrated by Fay Stanley's daughter, Diane Stanley, and this mother-daughter team has come up with a captivating and sad true story about a portion of history little of us know anything about.<br />Princess Ka'iulani was the niece of the king of Hawaii when she was born towards the coming of the 20th century.  Great rejoicing attended her birth, as the king himself had no children.  By all accounts, Ka'iulani was cheerful, beautiful, polite, kind, intelligent, and more than worthy of taking over the throne when the time came.  Unfortunately, Americans intervened and little by little usurped the king's power.  By the time Ka'iulani returned to the island after her schooling in England, the Hawaiian islands were an entirely different place--and not for the better.<br />Ka'iulani appealed to President Grover Cleveland's better nature and although he did his best to help her, upon leaving the White House after his presidency, Ka'iulani now had no American political friends.  It was far more in America's interests to annex Hawaii to America than it was to help this charming, serious princess regain her rightful access to the Hawaiian throne.<br />This is a terrifically absorbing tale.  Ka'iulani is presented beautifully by the illustrations, which show different aspects of her personality while always emphasizing her dignity and popularity among the Hawaiian people.  The two Stanley ladies have taken a little-known subject and presented it to us with power and handsome decoration, and the end result is highly compelling.	2002-08-04

Ann Keay Beneduce retells Jonathan Swift's classic \\"Gulliver's Adventures in Lilliput\\" here, and her slightly softened retelling is just right for both younger and older children (my five- and eight-year olds both loved this alike).  It's such a great story, and holds up so beautifully despite the passing of centuries.  Every child likes to imagine being bigger, so Gulliver's amazing transformation into the gigantic human among the Lilliputians plays into their most daring fantasies.<br />The real stand-out here, beyond the simple lines of this wonderful tale, are Gennady Spirin's sumptuous illustrations.  Spirin never hits a false note here.  Gulliver's clothing is historically correct, and when note is made in the text of the different Lilliputian fashions, you realize that Spirin has given all the little men and women ever-so-slightly-different spins on typical clothing of the time--enough to make them seem a little offbeat, but not enough to make them otherwordly.  Spirin is able, through this simple artistic device, to subtly emphasize what Gulliver and his tiny friends have in common, rather than the differences among them.<br />The colors are gorgeous, and Spirin's work with anything metallic--be it fabric, a gun, or a flagpole--is something to behold.  Everything glows, and the detail is magnificent.  You could sit and gaze at the illustrations for hours and never be bored--and always find something new to admire.

The twist is that all the characters are animals instead of humans.  <br />Conover's story is not as rich as the illustrations that accompany it, but those are so sumptuous and colorful that they more than make up for the slight weak spots in the tale itself.  Leo is a baby lion with wings who, when he discovers how to use them, accidentally flies too far from home.  He lands in the kingdom of King Otto of the North--a bear who teaches Leo how to read.  When Leo returns home, he shares this wonderful knowledge with his parents and subjects.<br />The illustrations really are something to behold.  The animals all have an innate dignity and the detail is rich.  There is a Jan Brett quality to Conover's work that is most becoming.

Angelina Mouseling is a small white mouse--perhaps somewhere between six and ten years old in people years--who has the complete attention of her parents and grandparents no matter what.  Then one day, her mother has a baby!  The new baby sister, Polly, is adorable and Angelina tries very, very hard to be interested and attentive and loving.  But it's tough.  No one is much paying attention to Angelina now that Polly's here, and that's especially upsetting to Angelina because she's recently been given an award at dance class.<br />Angelina finally gives in to her anger and throws off steam in the privacy of her bedroom.  The problem is that in doing so, she accidentally breaks the award statuette she's recently earned.  The adults--parents and grandparents alike--are surprised by Angelina's mood and soon figure out the connection to the new baby, Polly.  <br />All ends well, however, and Angelina is able to look at Polly as a possible new audience member for Angelina's impromptu dance recitals at home.  This is a dear, sweet book that examines honestly the difficulties involved in dealing with a new sibling.  The illustrations by Helen Craig are, as always, just precious--softly colored, beautifully detailed, and always in step with the text.	2002-08-01

Angelina Mouseling--a wee white mouse--loves to dance, to the exclusion of all other activities.  She won't clean her room, she won't help clear the table, she listens to neither her mother or her father because she is dancing, dancing, dancing at every waking moment.  Everything changes when her parents recognize that her interest needs to be taken seriously.  Mr. and Mrs. Mouseling do just that when they go shopping and come home with--ooooh!--a ballerina's tutu for Angelina to wear.<br />Shortly thereafter, Angelina begins ballet lessons.  Her perseverence pays off and she becomes a famous ballerina.  In the interim, however, the attention her parents have paid to her love of ballet pays off in the form of her willingness to do all the things she didn't want to do before, because now she can dance all she likes in ballet class and in recitals.<br />I agree with the comments that have been made about the subdued sexism here.  Angelina is presented as someone who is too fast and too nimble for the boys on the playground, but later in the book--once she has gotten what she wants--she is described as letting the boys catch her after all.  It's a jarring note in an otherwise perfectly charming book.<br />Special mention must be made of Helen Craig's detailed, charming drawings.  She doesn't completely anthropomorphize the mouse characters--they are clearly little animals, with anatomically correct limbs and quivering whiskers, but Craig somehow manages to humanize them and make them utterly winsome and dear.  All around a very nice book for the aspiring ballerina!	2002-08-01

When she tells the reader what to do, she doesn't just say, &quot;Do it&quot;--she explains her thinking and experience behind the directive.  This makes you feel that you're in capable hands, as indeed you are.<br />I really liked the additions of crust and sauce recipes.  I was particularly intrigued by the inclusion of a crust recipe which uses crunched-up ice cream cones as the main ingredient--what a simple yet brilliant idea (wish I'd come up with it myself!).  There are old favorites in here, as well as desserts with a new twist:  Pumpkin Mousse Pie, Piña Colada Pie, White Chocolate Ganache and Banana Pie, Ricotta Cream Pie with Blood Oranges, Couscous and Apricot Pudding Pie, and so on.  The more traditional pies include Rich Chocolate Mousse Pie, Chocolate-Mint Sorbet Pie, Coffee Heath Bar Ice Cream Pie, and even a yumilicious-looking S'Mores Pie.<br />This slim but well-researched volume is an excellent choice as a hostess gift for the folks with whom you're going on vacation--or as a special treat for your favorite dessert-maker.

While recipes abound, there is a distracting inconsistency on the use of numbers-sometimes they are spelled out (one cup), and sometimes they are listed numerically (1 cup).  This is especially annoying with fractions, which are spelled out throughout the book.  <br />Still, this volume has its priorities straight, for the most part, and devotes generous space to the simple foundations of good cooking: the humble egg, knives and knife technique, and so on.  Overall, this is intelligently designed and gorgeously photographed.	2002-07-26

This dinky volume can almost fit into your pocket, but it manages to cover a great deal of culinary territory in an authoritative, detailed manner.  For the everyday cook and for quick and easy reference, go for the power and accuracy of this enormously useful volume.  I probably use it more than all my other culinary reference books, which number in the dozens.  Highly recommended for the concise, crisp text, correctness of its information, and breadth.	2002-07-26

The grand-père of culinary references, this bills itself as &quot;the world's greatest culinary encyclopedia,&quot; but the emphasis is still, oh! so French.  The stiffness inherent in translation shows; among other things, Larousse uses the wonderfully awkward term &quot;cookery correspondent&quot; to mean a food writer.  Try looking up common American edibles--the martini, say, or meatloaf--and you'll get nowhere.  French toast is listed as a dessert, not a breakfast.  <br />If you can put up with occasional snootiness, though, you're in for a treat.  This is good enough to be read, paged through, nibbled at like a fine cheese, as it's as much a history book as a reference.  Absolutely fascinating stuff abounds here, and the photography is splendid.	2002-07-26

Julie Danneberg's \\"First Day Jitters\\" ought to be mandatory reading for all preschoolers and kindergarteners before they go off to school the first day.  Sarah Jane Hartwell is snuggled down tightly under her covers, not wanting to go to her new school, while Mr. Hartwell urges and cajoles her into moving along.  Mr. Hartwell drives her to school, where the principal, Mrs. Burton, kindly meets Sarah Jane at the car and personally escorts her into the classroom.  And on the last page is a wonderful surprise that is guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any young child who's concerned about that all-important first day!<br />Judy Love's vivid ink and watercolor drawings have a great sense of movement and are pleasingly colorful.  She does an especially fine job of hinting at the surprise to come on the last page without giving it away via the illustrations.	2002-07-26

He follows two sisters (and nominally, their parents and friends) as they spend their days sailing, swimming, battening down for a big storm, and so on.  Nothing of great import happens, but McCloskey has a lovely, calming way of relating their story so that we feel the sisters' closeness, their connection to their environment, and their childlike ability to find beauty and interest in nearly everything.<br />McCloskey's book was first published in 1957, and the illustrations show this--no life vests in a lot of the boating pictures, children swimming without being watched over by a lifeguard or adult, and so on.  Still, that's not a bad thing--it shows the protective, exclusionary nature of childhood and the risks children take without even being fully aware that they ARE taking risks.<br />The illustrations are lovely.  These paintings depict Maine as being beautiful without neglecting to show the dangerous side of coastal life as well (witness the storm scenes towards the end of the book).  There is a caressing, rhythmic feel to the text which subtly imitates the tidal pull of the ocean.  What a perfect gift for anyone who vacations in Maine--or wants to.	2002-07-26

Her mind is endlessly inventive and she manages to convey important truths and vital life lessons without ever once descending into preachiness or condescencion.<br />Such is the case with \\"The Bee Tree.\\"  Polacco combines her usual rollicking, active illustrations with text that rambles and gamboles about all over the place.  Mary Ellen is a little girl who's bored by reading and just wants to be outside running around.  Her grandfather, through the course of a shaggy-dog-story-chase about hunting for honey, manages to convey to her the limitless things she can learn via books.  The lesson is clear without being pedantic.	2002-07-26

As it turns out, Hillary's all-time-favorite heroine, an actress, is ever-so-slightly chunky just like Hillary is--and Hillary learns that there's nothing wrong with bodies coming in all shapes, sizes, and colors.<br />It's an important lesson, but Caple sometimes edges into pedagogy in telling it.  Still, overall, this is a valuable book--for little girls especially.	2002-07-26

Lebowitz is unusual in being an American humorist of the barbed--not warm and fuzzy, like Erma Bombeck--variety. She lays on the sarcasm and the weary, I've-seen-it-all attitude a little thick at times, but hey, this woman was born in the wrong era and you can't blame her for that. Picture Dorothy Parker come back to life with a fleshier face and uncooperative hair and you have a decent picture of Lebowitz.<br />I can't resist quoting. Some of these are classics that you may be surprised to learn came from Lebowitz:<br />\\"My favorite way to wake up is to have a certain French movie star whisper to me softly at two-thirty in the afternoon that if I want to get to Sweden in time to pick up my Nobel Prize for Literature, I had better ring for breakfast. This occurs rather less often than one might wish.\\"<br />* * *<br />\\"There is no such thing as inner peace. There is only nervousness or death.\\"<br />* * *<br />\\"All God's children are not beautiful. Most of God's children are, in fact, barely presentable.\\"<br />* * *<br />\\"[In grade school,] I believed passionately that Communists were a race of horned men who divided their time equally between the burning of Nancy Drew books and the devising of a plan of nuclear attack that would land the largest and most lethal bomb squarely upon the third-grade class of Thomas Jefferson School in Morristown, New Jersey.\\"<br />* * *<br />\\"Polite conversation is rarely either.\\"<br />* * *<br />\\"The only appropriate reply to the queston, 'Can I be frank?' is 'Yes, if I can be Barbara.' \\"<br />* * *<br />\\"Looking genuinely attentive is like sawing a girl in half and then putting her back together. It is seldom achieved without the use of mirrors.\\"<br />* * *<br />Well, I could go on and on, clearly, but I'll stop quoting if only just to say that this is the kind of sophisticated humor book you can devour in one gulp--or pace yourself and enjoy it slowly and luxuriously, like nibbling away at a particularly fine bittersweet chocolate mousse. <br />Despite the occasional reference which dates these pieces to their 1970s origin (such as instructions for disco behavior), most of the essays hold up amazingly well because they do the time-honored humorist trick of commenting on basic human foibles. This is a delightful, subversive book.	2002-07-26

I have to admit to NOT liking it the first couple of times I read it to my kids, partly because the stranger in question remains a stranger throughout the book.  Van Allsburg gives us no easy answers here.  Still, this makes the book an excellent jumping-off place for questions about who we are, what makes a group of people a family or a community, and how well we really all know each other.<br />The illustrations are, as usual, stellar van Allsburg stuff.  The cover portrait especially, of the stranger being served soup by Farmer Bailey's wife, is very nearly hypnotic.  The stranger's face is suffused with a mixture of fear and wonderment, and you find yourself thinking, \\"Is it the soup that fascinates him?  The tureen across the table?  The farmer's wife?\\"  It really gets you thinking.	2002-07-26

It is not only inexpensive, but possibly one of the best culinary dictionaries available for the home cook who simply wants a decent resource for occasional questions.  <br />My basic test for a culinary reference book is to look up &quot;falernum&quot; (a by-product of rum distillation which is used as a flavoring in fruit desserts--sort of along the lines of grenadine).  Well, &quot;falernum&quot; isn't in here, but so much other stuff is that I'm not complaining.<br />The pronunciations are a little iffy on foreign language terms, and the definition brevity is sometimes confusing (kiu is listed as &quot;an ancient Chinese beer.&quot;  OK.  Does that make it a beer from ancient times, or a really old fermented brew that's currently available?).  Still, these are minor quibbles for an admirably complete book.	2002-07-26

Really, Really Angry . . . \\" is a much-needed examination of a too-little looked-at emotion: anger.  Everyone knows that kids get angry--sometimes furiously so--but they don't have the social and emotional skills to deal with their anger the way that most adults can.  The result is scary for a lot of kids--they can feel hijacked by their anger.<br />Molly Bang gives us perspective with this book.  She acknowledges right up front that kids get wacko angry, as Sophie does here when she has a disagreement with her sister.  Bang does a superb and subtle job of representing the angry pages with hot, shimmering colors--a juicy lipstick red, a neon orange, and a glowing yellow.  Then as Sophie bangs out of doors to take a walk and calm down, Bang begins to introduce cool, soothing colors in the blues-greens-purples range.  It's a winning marriage of text and illustration.<br />When Sophie returns to her home, she is greeted with smiles and joy.  She feels calmer, her anger dissipated, and she's back in the fold.  The thing I love most about this book is that it takes childhood anger as a fact, not a problem, and shows children a good way to work through that anger.  I recommend this very highly.	2002-07-26

She shows a wee child MOTH being \\"sMOTHered\\" with kisses and gives us a hilarious illustration of a group of colorfully-dressed LICE posing for the photo on their drivers' LICEnse.  <br />It takes only a few minutes to look through this book, but it will really get you--and your kids--thinking and looking for other insect names within other words.

After decades as the premiere magazine of antique American homes, it changed its name to &quot;Classic American Home&quot; and then was out of business in the ad-pages slump that followed September 11th, 2001.  It was a great loss to those who love viewing and learning about historical American homes.<br />Fortunately, even if you were never a &quot;Colonial Homes&quot; subscriber, you can still indulge your love for classic American style via Rosemary Rennicke's lovely &quot;Classic American Decorating.&quot;  The homes features herein are all taken from the pages of the magazine, and they amply show the magazine's high quality and standards.  There is no country-kitschy stuff here--everything is distilled to its purest essence, whether it is a keeping room in an 18th century Connecticut home or the bedroom in a high-rise Manhattan apartment building. <br />The book is divided into chapters covering architecture, furniture, accessories, and so on.  The photography is handsome, and the book design is pleasing to the eye.  Rennicke's text is admirable not only for its insight, but for its restraint.  She leads the reader gently along, pointing out what is of interest without being intrusive or overly pedantic.  This is a coffee table book home-lovers will turn to again and again for a sweet indulgence in domestic day-dreaming.	2002-07-26

It has all the flavor of a folk tale passed down through generations, but with a decidedly modern twist.<br />The twist is this: Tsugele, a perfectly capable young woman who is perfectly happy on her own, is told by her parents that she needs to get married.  Tsugele reasonably tells them that she sees no need for that, as she's fine all by her independent self.  They insist, and Tsugele good-naturedly suffers through the attentions of several suitors before finally finding the man she really loves in a most unexpected manner.<br />Dirk Zimmer's terrific illustrations combine a block-print border with stylized drawings of Tsugele and the other characters.  He uses color to very great effect, giving the book the fantastical look of eastern European embroidery.  Highly recommended for any independent little girl!	2002-07-26

As a French import translated into other languages, it lists only a dozen varieties of apple (what, no Jonathan?), for example, but gives snails their own chapter.  <br />For a volume that provides a close look at such relatively exotic fare as jicama and carambola, a pronunciation guide would have been a nice addition.  The book is arranged into sections (vegetables, legumes, cereals and grains, and so on-seaweed even has its own chapter), and every food is shown both whole and in cross-section.  Like &quot;Larousse Gastronomique,&quot; this is an eminently useful volume written with a definite French slant.	2002-07-26

Without talking down to young children, she manages to convey the importance of stick-to-itiveness and the great love a young scarecrow boy has for his father.  Trying the best he can to live up to his father's work ethic and talents, the little scarecrow boy tries and tries to scare the crows away.  Although he fails over and over again, he does eventually succeed and sees that not only is his father proud of him--he is proud of HIMSELF.  This is a great lesson quietly told--it's not preachy or high-handed in any way.<br />Brown's charming tale is greatly bolstered by the color-saturated illustrations of David Diaz.  These have a lovely, soft 1930s look that reminds me very much of the illustrations in the original Raggedy Ann and Andy books.  I especially like the way Diaz pulls back his perspective on the last page so that you really see why the little scarecrow boy feels, happily, that all is right with the world.	2002-07-26

Here is the perfect gift for your favorite little girl who happens to be longing and yearning for long hair: Lois Duncan's astute \\"The Longest Hair in the World.\\"  Emily appears in the beginning of the book as a spunky redhead with a short haircut.  But at her birthday party, mindful of the fact that only long-haired girls will be chosen to play princesses in an upcoming school play, Emily wishes for \\"the longest hair in the world.\\"  <br />Trouble and calamity ensues as Emily's wish comes true.  It gets to the point where her father has to zip her through the local car wash in order to get her streaming locks shampooed!  Finally, a year later on her next birthday, Emily makes a new wish--not the one you might think--and the book ends on a hilarious note.<br />Jon McIntosh's cartoony illustrations perfectly suit the zany tone and zippy pace of Duncan's text.  He does an especially fine job depicting the growing burden Emily has in carrying around the longest hair in the world.	2002-07-21

Zin! Zin! A Violin.\\"  Lucky man, he hit it out of the park with his very first attempt. <br />Moss uses propulsive, rhyming text to introduce children not only to different musical instruments, but to the Italian terms by which their groupings are known (solo, duo, trio and so on).  Moss's poetry is enhanced immeasurably by illustrator Marjorie Priceman's vigorous and colorful artwork.  Borrowing elements from Chagall, Rousseau, and Bemelmans--without ever stooping to a visually derivative look--Priceman's pictures more than matches the energy of Moss' text.  Her colors are lush and saturated: a rich periwinkle, jet black, sunset pink, and lipstick red all work together here, along with shots of teal, orange, grey and other colors.  The overall effect is, quite simply, delicious.  The whole leaves you wanting more--exactly the effect any children's book should have.	2002-07-20

Addy takes the intriguing question of \\"What happened right here on this spot--last week, last year, a million years ago?\\" and turns it into a meditation on change, time, loss, and more.  She goes from pre-human history to native Americans hunting to pioneers to Civil War soldiers, all planting them firmly in the exact same spot, living their lives out, leaving their fragments of history for future generations to find.<br />Addy's tale is more than matched by the breathtaking illustrations of artist John Clapp.  Clapp, who teaches illustration at San Jose State University, has done a superlative job of giving larger life to the text without overpowering it.  His illustrations are not only incredibly realistic and beautiful, but they transcend their medium by having an almost emotive quality.  You almost hold your breath to see the Civil War soldier waving goodbye from a field.<br />I can't recommend \\"Right Here on This Spot\\" highly enough, and hope that reading this review will spur more readers to purchase it.  It will become a much-loved favorite in your family, too.	2002-07-20

She reminds me so very much of both Emma Bovary and Scarlett O'Hara.  Her determination to keep the Eustace family diamonds entirely for herself is what sets the novel in motion, and with this rather simple device, Trollope goes on to spin out a tale which encompasses morality, greed, Victorian social mores, the corrupting influence of money, and the blindness it can cause to everything else of value.<br />Lizzie is contrasted, with every shade under the sun, with the sweet and constant Lucy Morris.  Picture the contrast as one very much like that of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes.  \\"The Eustace Diamonds\\" is a deliciously satisfying book, and a classic for a very good reason: despite having been written in the 19th century, what it has to say reverberates as soundly now as when Trollope first published it.  I can't recommend it highly enough.	2002-07-20

I have a soft spot for anything that takes place during the years I was in high school myself (late 1970s and early 1980s), as this does.  But my predisposition to like the book because of that was amply rewarded by a story that is, by turns, laugh-out-loud hilarious, furiously serious, and as awkward as everyone's high school years are at some point.<br />Jeremy Ruskin is a sophomore at Hutch Falls High School in Hutch Falls, New Jersey.  Although we gradually glean that he's an athlete, he has all the inner goofiness and questions of a major dork--which endears him to the reader.  Weisberg has a razor-sharp ear for dialogue, and for the pseudo-sophisticated tone many teenagers take, as shown below.  And please note: you get over the lack of punctuation pretty quickly--it just adds to the idea that Jeremy is writing this journal for a class and isn't overly concerned with it being perfectly correct as far as grammar and punctuation.<br />\\"I don't eat meat\\" Caroline says she takes a cucumber out of a baggie and holds it up.<br />\\"Do you always bring lunch?\\" Gillian says.<br />\\"Yeah my Mom makes it\\" I say and then I feel stupid because don't most people make their own lunch?<br />\\"My Mom can't even make a sandwich\\" Gillian says.<br />\\"What do you eat?\\" I ask.<br />\\"We go to a restaurant called Olives a lot.\\"  Eating out a lot is not a good sign of family togetherness.  Caroline says \\"My Mom cooks but it's all like hello do you know I'm a vegetarian?\\"  She puts a piece of celery between her 2 lips.<br />Another dead-on bit takes place when Jeremy is in the Limited shopping with his sister Claire:<br />Claire holds the blue dress up and I think it looks good but I don't say anything because I'm a guy and what do guys know about it.  Except she says \\"do you like it? so then I say \\"definitely\\" and then she puts it back anyway proving what I said.<br />Witness the following description of a family vacation in England:<br />My Dad of course found the cheapest hotel in Europe in 1 of his \\"Cheapest Weirdest and Grossest Places in the World\\" guidebooks . . . Anyway we go to all the museums where I'm bored and so's my Mom and so's Beth but Claire and my Dad are in Museum Heaven.  Claire can look at a painting forever my Dad can look at the little plaque about who painted it and where and when and who gave it to the museum forever because it's like reading.  Me and Mom and Beth finally have a revolt and declare we're not going with them to the National Museum of Boring Paintings that day and we go off but then they go to shop so I wander around England alone for awhile and it's kind of cool . . .<br />Possibly the funniest episode--and one that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever been a horny teenage <BR>boy--is the part where Jeremy buys a porno magazine:<br />I head for the train station.  I look about 5000 times to see if you can see through the bag and even though you can't if you hold it up to the light and you're about a 10th of an inch away you can see the outline of the bottom of a naked t-t.  I keep walking and finally I get on the train.  Now I could know anybody on the train and I swear it's like the bag has basically huge letters on it that say \\"JEREMIAHS RAUNCHY FRENCH LUST PORNO HE JUST BOUGHT\\" . . . I would probably see Renee [the girl he has a crush on] at the train station in Hutch Falls and she'd say \\"hi Jeremy\\" and we'd talk for a second in Spanish and then she'd say \\"what's in your bag?\\" \\"Sports Illustrated\\". Then she'd say \\"Oh can I see it?  There's this article I heard about.\\"  About some tennis player or something.  And I'd say \\"Yeah but excuse me because I have to go kill myself\\" . . . I took a cab home possible people who were home were my Mom who would look at the bag and instantly know what was in there because she's psychic about anything you don't want her to know so she'd be like \\"Jeremy is that issue number 62 of French Lust?\\"<br />And on and on and on.  There's such wonderful stuff here.  Weisberg gets it exactly right when he shows the fluidity of teenage relationships, the uncertainty on the part of teenagers--as far as what their personality and values are, how to deal with friends and crushes and family--and how to react to what they see as wrongdoing or dysfunction.  He also gets the ending exactly right.  We don't know, really, where or how Jeremy is going to end up--but it's a superbly entertaining and truthful ride along the way.	2002-07-20

When so much of the world was (and is) focused on heroes and men in general, what a gentle and lovely surprise to come across a book which celebrates the rabbit--a lady rabbit!--who becomes the Easter bunny.<br />With elements of Aesop peeping in and out of the text (not the least of which includes the fable of the tortoise and the hare), Heyward manages to make a rabbit with 21 little children sound not only sane, but brilliant.  The Country Bunny (or Little Cottontail Mother, as she is called throughout) gives her children each small chores to keep them busy, contribute to the overall quality of their shared family life, and make them feel like valued members of the group.  They grow up to be sweet, cheerful, polite, and industrious bunnies, and the Country Bunny uses their fine breeding to great effect to achieve an audition for the role of Easter Bunny. <br />Heyward's text is inimitably enriched by the sweet pictures of artist Marjorie Flack.  The bunnies are plush and adorable, the scenery idyllic, and the colors bright as Technicolor.  This is a trip down Memory Lane, even for those who didn't grow up with the book, and a future memory-maker for any child who loves Easter and Easter bunnies.	2002-07-20

It seemed a strange thing to read while at the beach, but I was absolutely captivated.  What a fevered imagination Ms. Peters has!  The showstoppingly gorgeous desserts and projects she shows within include a layer cake covered with fondant that has been pieced and quilted to resemble and antique quilt (and it surely does); a chocolate bowl filled to overflowing with spectacular chocolate spheres (the cover photograph); hinged, jointed cookies which really move and make splendid Christmas ornaments (all in human forms, like Santa, Raggedy Ann, and so on); gift boxes made entirely of decorated cookie dough; a shimmering &quot;stained glass&quot; cake; and a three-dimensional Christmas gazebo constructed around a towering decorated Christmas tree made of piped icing.  <br />Even if the projects herein appear way too complicated or time-consuming for most people--as they do for me, I'll admit--Ms. Peters gives splendidly clear, concise directions in a conversational tone that make starting your own gingerbread house seem, somehow, not as daunting as it really should be.	2002-07-20

As simple and charming and lovely today as it was when first published in 1963, it describes the small adventures of Peter, a city boy who wakes up one day to find the city entirely shrouded in snow.  Peter does what any other red-blooded child would do: he puts on his snowsuit and runs outside.  There he indulges in the age-old pursuits of making funny footprints in the snow, hitting a tree to watch the clumps of snow fall from it, making a snowman and snow angels, and sliding down a hill covered with snow.  He even packs a snowball into his coat pocket.<br />The story is minimalist, as are the collages which illustrate the text, but the overall effect is delicious.  Peter is a nimble expression of childhood vitality and play, and the pictures combine fabric, rubber stamps, what looks to be wallpaper, paper cut-outs, and fiber to very great effect.  It's short, it's sweet, and it's simple--just like the best snowy days.	2002-07-19

She uses simple couplets to cover everything from veggie burgers to tacos to fish chowder (in the United States) and then goes well beyond American borders to look at Colombia, Italy, Puerto Rico, Japan, England, Australia, China, India, and more.  <br />Not only do the lunches sound delicious (and teach children reading the book of the astonishing diversity of culinary habits the world over), but Steve Bjorkman's cheerful, colorful illustrations go a long way towards making the unusual seem utterly appetizing.  This talented artist's work has appeared in national publications (he used to illustrate regularly for BETTER HOMES & GARDENS magazine, and I miss seeing his work there!).  The simple lines and happy look of his pictures perfectly suit Edith Baer's text.	2002-07-19

The problem, as shouted about by the king's young page, is that the king is having entirely too fine a time in the tub--and consequently, he's not getting out and attending to the affairs of his kingdom.<br />\\"No problem!\\" the court ladies and gentlemen say, confident that they can get the king out of the tub.  But despite the ante being consistently upped in every imaginable way, the king remains happily lolling in bathwater.  Illustrations of the king deserve special mention, as he is a delicious combination of England's King Henry VIII and a sort of demonic Burl Ives.  <br />After trying to get the king out by promising and cajoling and wheedling all sorts of fun things, the members of the court finally give up--and the young page gleefully comes up with a simple and wonderful solution.

But no, his mother is calling him to do a chore and Raymond mutters, \\"It's not fair!\\" and then realizes that he can \\"meanwhile . . . \\" out of his life just like his comic book heroes do.  Raymond zigs and zags around from one adventure to the next, always depending on \\"meanwhile . . . \\" to get him out of increasingly dangerous scrapes (it's hilarious to see the lengths he goes to to \\"meanwhile\\" in different situations).  <br />When Raymond finally ends his adventures . . . well, I don't want to give too much away.

What makes the book special is that the illustrations have the same gaiety and bounciness that the tune does, melding them beautifully together.  Color and shape and movement abound here, all culminating in a performance before family and friends that perfectly captures the energy of children this age.

Kellogg endows him with burly good looks and a great big smile, even as he has to twist a few arms to get attention paid to his exploits.  The cartoon-like illustrations are colorful and boisterous, which perfectly suits the rhythm of the text.

The illustrations are an absolute hoot--colorful, detailed, and abrim with delightful asides where tiny mice, rabbits, buffalo and other animals wink and grin at each other with quips appearing in cartoon-like balloons.

Bach's childhood	Sallie Ketcham's wonderful \\"Bach's Big Adventure\\" is that rare breed of book which manages to tie together a true story from a major historical figure's childhood with terrific illustrations--and throw in a palatable moral as well.<br />J. S. Bach apparently was quite a confident young man, boasting by the age of ten to all who would listen that he and he alone was the greatest organist in all Germany.  His confidence pierced by the sarcasm and truthfulness of his elder brother (who reared him once their parents had died), Bach decides that he will go to hear a concert by the man his brother says IS the greatest--an organist named Reincken.  <br />Suffice it to say that Bach is humbled by the experience and almost hesitates to join Reincken at the organ--but the elder man is encouraging and soon the two are playing a rollicking tune, much to the delight of both.  Reincken cheers the young Bach who does, in time, become the greatest organist in Germany and beyond.<br />Ketcham's tale is well told, with generous doses of humor.  Timothy Bush's watercolor illustrations are cartoonlike and serve to further humanize this great musician.  The book is a success and a treat to peruse.	2002-07-10

Angelina is a tiny white mouse who yearns to be feminine and sweet, but is sometimes headstrong and silly--just like most girls I know (including my five-year old daughter!).  Angelina has a dance recital coming up and she is pining away for a major role.  However, as she's sick on the day of auditions, she doesn't do well and in fact, barely is able to crawl back home and into her worried mother's arms.  She knows she did poorly, and her mother admits as much too, which brings me to one of the things I love about this book--there's no sugar-coating the fact that Angelina has gotten herself into a pickle.  It's a storybook, and a fantasy at that, but it's realistic enough to keep the edge off the sweetness.<br />Angelina is counseled by her mother to do her very best.  I don't want to give away the ending, but by keeping a cheerful attitude and trying to do her best for the whole dance company, Angelina is amply rewarded.  It's a story with a moral, but the moral isn't presented in a sickeningly sweet way.  <br />The illustrations by Helen Craig are truly a treat.  Set vaguely in a Victorian England mousedom, they depict tiny cottages with climbing vines, drapey dresses with floral prints, tiaras, bouquets, adorable furniture, and so on.  Three cheers to both Helen Craig and author Katharine Holabird for a book which is a joy to read and great fun to peruse just for the illustrations alone!	2002-07-09

She extolls the virtues of its colors, its softness, its size.  Still, she knows that she's too old for it and she wants to figure out a way to get rid of it that doesn't involve actually throwing it out.

Mrs. Peters starts off as patient as can be, as each of the seven children develops some quirk or another having to do with size, temperature, taste, or type of food that they absolutely, positively WILL NOT EAT.  She bends over backwards to accomodate their likes and dislikes, and the result is that the children are able to combine their favorite foods to come up with something wonderful for their wonderful mother's birthday.<br />The illustrations beautifully complement the story.  Artist Marla Frazee's work has something of a Hillary Knight look to it (think early \\"Eloise\\" by Kay Thompson), and she beautifully captures the frenetic wiggliness and activity inherent in a family with seven children.  Lots of fun for children, especially ones who happen to be (or know!) \\"silly eaters.\\"	2002-07-09

All the classic Stevenson pieces are here: \\"The Swing,\\" \\"The Land of Counterpane,\\" the terrific poem about a child's shadow.  Tudor depicts only children and animals herein--as it should be--without the presence of shadow of adults anywhere.  Both Stevenson and Tudor understand in their bones that no matter what grown-ups may think, children inhabit a world of their own.  That world is mostly beautiful, but sometimes fraught with danger or questions.  Those hints are present here, but the overwhelming impression any reader will have will be that of beauty--both in words and in pictures.	2002-07-09

Here, in an edition of his classic \\"A Child's Garden of Verses,\\" that fever is complemented in spades by the fantastical illustrations of English artist Joanna Isles.<br />Isles uses an arsenal of utterly frivolous flowers, borders, insects, birds, kings and queens, fairies, and more to expand upon the imagination exhibited in Stevenson's poems.  The children in these pictures are depicted as being in charge, being at one with their environment, and being delighted to be alive.  <br />Some of the illustrations hint at the influence of artists more famed than Isles (Henri Rousseau appears to be a special favorite of hers--see the illustration for \\"The Unseen Playmate,\\" in which a boy lies down in weeds that might have sprung from the edge of Rousseau's painting \\"The Dream\\").  Using both primary colors and pastels, Isles creates a world within the world of Stevenson's verse.  The marriage of the two is a happy one.	2002-07-09

Throughout the books, Little Bear's mother is presented as the all-knowing, all-loving, kindly parent figure (you can imagine how much any parent secretly enjoys that!).  The illustrations perfectly complement the calm, simple tone taken by Minarik in her tales.  They present Little Bear as the typical kid: by turns curious, goofy, sad, frustrated, content, sleepy, joyful.  We see the illogic involved in so many of the rites of passage of childhood without ever feeling that Little Bear is being made fun of.

They are so alive that they very nearly leap off the page.<br />Mama Cat's children are named Fluffy, Skinny, and Boris.  Looks like Boris is always missing out on the fun, as his favorite activity in life is napping.  By the end of the book, however, he surprises everyone with his active nature--and then reverts to his usual self so we know that deep down he hasn't changed.

The key word here, my dears, is \\"bride\\" in the book's title. Baldrige's work doesn't purport to say anything about the marriages that followed these weddings--only that the brides themselves were gorgeous, amazing, almost fantastical creatures who caught the imagination of nearly everyone when they appeared on the world stage.<br />That said, there are great things about this book and not-so-great things. It's fun to see so many photos of these lovely brides--among them, the two named above and Jacqueline Kennedy, Princess Grace, Wallis Warfield Simpson, and Consuelo Vanderbilt. Many of the photos were either previously unpublished or not well-known by the general public, so they appear here in fresh light. The photos and the handsome graphic design are among the excellent things about the book, as are the little anecdotes (such as what each famous bridal couple gave each other and the members of their wedding parties as gifts).<br />The down side is that Baldrige tries to meld a wedding etiquette book with a coffee table overview of, well, legendary brides. I'm not sure it works all that well. While she undoubtedly has excellent advice to offer all of us on the planning and execution of a memorable wedding, I for one would have preferred that these pages had been devoted to a broader group of other legendary brides. What, for instance, of the English Queen Mother and King George? What about the current Japanese crown prince and princess? What about other well-known society or Hollywood brides? Others are touched on lightly here, but Baldrige doesn't devote the space to them that her title promises.	2002-06-26

Byatt's work before, but when a friend gave me \\"Possession\\" for Christmas, I decided to read it before the movie version came out (on August 16th, 2002). I finished it utterly in awe of Byatt's prodigious grasp of a wide range of subjects: poetry, fiction, Victorian manners and symbolism, academic jealousy, and more. She combines all these, not to mention a rollicking good mystery, in \\"Possession\\" with an assurance and ease that belie the complexity of the book.<br />Briefly, Byatt interweaves a modern-day academic mystery with a Victorian romance. Her modern-day main characters, Maud Bailey and Roland Michell, join forces to uncover the truth behind the many Victorian veils involved in covering up the Victorian romance between Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. The ending is supremely powerful and feels exactly right given the preceding pages. Byatt writes gorgeous, intricate poetry on the part of both Ash and LaMotte, and both poets come vividly to life via Byatt's poems and the letters she writes from their point of view. So, too, do Bailey and Michell come alive as flesh-and-blood characters here. Byatt's astonishing trick is to keep them separate, yet intertwined across the span of a century, and to make each of their wants and desires vividly real.<br />\\"Possession\\" is a masterful work. It gives me hope for the modern novel in a way no other book has in years. I salute Byatt for her imagination and her prose, not to mention her poetry. I stand in awe of this immensely rewarding book and recommend it highly.	2002-06-23

She admits in her foreword to being subject to those twin little girls dreams of a) being a movie star and b) being a bride, and her infectious enthusiasm for both subjects comes across brilliantly here.<br />Schreier offers us a delightful overview of Hollywood weddings here, with everything from silent films to modern-day set pieces to real-life Hollywood brides in both their Hollywood and their personal incarnations as brides.  As you might expect, there are some omissions here (what, no Liza Minnelli?  No Cher?  No Lucille Ball?  No Jane Fonda?), but for the most part, Schreier does a super job of hitting high points of Hollywood wedding lore including, of course, the much-married Elizabeth Taylor (who graces the front cover of the book and gets her own special section inside).<br />Aside from the terrific photographs--many of which I'd never seen, and I own entirely too many movie-oriented books--the eye candy is more than matched by the many anecdotes, like:<br />1) Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy's bridal gown designer was African-American;<BR>2) &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; actress Elsa Lanchester's bridal hairdo in the film was inspired by ancient profiles of Egyptian queen Nefertiti;<BR>3) Olivia de Havilland kept her Dior costumes from the 1962 bridal picture &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot; and when she sold them later at auction, the successful bidder was the House of Dior, buying them for their collection;<BR>4) Marilyn Monroe's gown from her first marriage (at age sixteen in 1942) was later worn, sans sleeves, by Monroe's niece on her first date.<br />This is a wonderful book and reading it is a completely pleasant way to spend an hour or two.	2002-06-23

It's a complete hoot, with wonderful, simple text by Doreen Cronin and watercolor illustrations by the great Betsy Lewin.<br />The trouble starts when the cows stumble across an old manual typewriter.  Before you know it, they're mooing and moaning about being cold and they're demanding electric blankets so they'll be more comfortable in the drafty old barn!  The farmer is, of course, outraged and refuses their request.  The cows subsequently up the ante by refusing to give milk.  Back and forth, back and forth they go and just when everything finally seems settled and back-to-normal, the ducks get into the act.<br />This is great good fun for readers of all ages and will especially appeal to little kids who appreciate the idea of struggling with authority.	2002-06-03

It documents, from January through December, the hard tasks and simple pleasures inherent in life on a farm--everything from bird migrations to the foaling of the horses to lazy summer days spent doing nothing more important swatting flies.<br />Humans and animals co-exist peacefully here.  The illustrations are simple and gently colored, with subtle detail sprinkled throughout.  The animals are given a great deal of personality (see especially the cats, who are wonderfully quirky) and the story itself, while utterly basic and free of frills, has an undertow of narrative propulsion that makes each page seem a natural outgrowth of the previous page.<br />I can't recommend the book highly enough.  If you live in the country, you will recognize so much of what is here.  If you live in the city, you will welcome the peaceful rhythms of this charming book.	2002-06-03

We pull it down occasionally and still giggle all over the place at some of these goofy poems--beautifully enhanced by Joan Gallup's equally goofy illustrations.<br />In addition to poets I already knew, like Jack Prelutsky, Ogden Nash, Lewis Carroll, and Laura E. Richards, there were lots of wonderful pieces by poets I'd never heard of before.  There are limericks, riddling poems, and poems about such sometimes-serious subjects as church, dentures, and falling in love.  No subject is sacred here--everything is given up for the cause of good humor.<br />Lots of fun for everyone, and a wonderful example for children to see that poetry doesn't have to a) always rhyme or b) be about serious or lofty things.	2002-06-03

Author Anne Miranda subverts the typical \\"To Market, To Market\\" rhyme with her own funnybone squarely at the fore of her thinking.  Among other things, our huffy old lady goes \\"To market, to market\\" to cows, lambs, fish, and more, only to discover that they're making a wreck of her home.  The pig is lolling on the counter, the hen has nested in the cutlery drawer, and the lamb is resting comfortably in the dishwasher.<br />What to do?!??  Although the lady verges on panic, she gets it together, assembles the ingredients for a lovely (vegetarian) meal, and everyone is seated at the end to enjoy the steaming vegetable soup she's made.<br />Miranda's humorous text is greatly aided by the illustrations of the talented Janet Stevens.  Stevens combines actual black-and-white photographs with acrylic, pastel, and colored pencil illustrations.  The result is a series of pictures with an up-to-the-minute feeling and a great deal of interest.  Lots of fun for very young kids--and, luckily, for their parents as well.	2002-06-03

Those bossy farm animals are back and here, they decide to turn things to their advantage when Farmer Brown goes on vacation.  Leaving his easygoing brother Bob in charge is a mistake, as the animals get manipulative--demanding pizza, videos at night (\\"The Sound of Moosic,\\" naturally!) and so on.<br />I can't say enough about Betsy Lewin's illustrations.  With just a few swooping lines and a sensitive use of color, she manages to give each animal its own personality while simultaneously carrying along the narrative thrust of the story.  Her pictures are a joy to behold and a testament to the power of simplicity.<br />Poor Bob does what he can to make the animals happy, and by the time Farmer Brown arrives home, everything is in hilarious disarray.  Although this isn't quite up to the level of \\"Click, Clack, Moo,\\" it'd be a fun gift for a child who already has the earlier book.	2002-06-03

I have always had a soft spot for anything Sandra Boynton does, but \\"Chocolate: The Consuming Passion\\" is probably my favorite of her books.  I have bought it for more chocolate-loving friends than I can count and they have all been thrilled with it.<br />Boynton deftly blends together her signature cartoon animals (who for the most part try to look dignified in less than dignified circumstances--the key to their hilarity), actual chocolate facts (on the front of the book, it says, \\"Written, Illustrated, and Overresearched by Sandra Boynton\\"), and a heaping helping of utter silliness.  Boynton tosses her own opinion in wherever possible:<br />\\"Those who favor dark chocolate have little patience with cute candy.\\"<br />\\"Whoever said, 'The best things in life are free' was, of course, just kidding.  The best things in life go for $6.50 a pound and up.\\"<br />\\"Chocolate is not a privilege; it is a right.\\"<br />\\"If the remotest possibility exists that you could become snowbound, take this simple precaution: Remove and discard all insulation from ski jacket.  Replace with seven lbs. (approx.) of shaved chocolate. Resew seams.  Warning: Never warm up in front of a fire without first removing jacket.\\"<br />See especially Boynton's sections on white chocolate and carob (as you might expect, she's a dark chocolate snob, as are so many chocolate aficionados) and her hilarious explanation of the \\"myth of chocolate's fattingness.\\"  Boynton gives helpful information on opening up your own cacao plantation--on which you will need \\"4,000 or so cacao seedlings and time\\" and an international section on how to ask for chocolate in half a dozen languages.<br />There are even recipes, including one for \\"Chocolate Chip Cookie (Theoretical yield: 48 cookies, 2 inches each) and \\"Hippo Pôt de Mousse.\\"  This book has pleasures that keep on giving even after the first, second, or fourteenth reading.	2002-06-03

It's a comforting thought, and it's beautifully presented here.<br />Victoria Wirth's quiet, quiet text concerns an oak tree which drops an acorn deep in the woods.  As the acorn grows into a sapling and then into a tree, we see through A. Scott Banfill's magical illustrations that the parent tree is growing older and weaker.  When the parent tree eventually dies, the children trees sorrowfully cover her with leaves and await the spring--in which, of course, new acorns fall and new trees begin to grow.<br />Trees aside, Banfill manages to squeeze in tiny elves, butterflies, rabbit families, bears, and all manner of birds, among other animals.  As if that weren't enough, each of his gorgeous illustrations is bordered with a handsome, each-one-different swath of stylized elements from nature: leaves, snowflakes, flowers, insects, and so on.<br />The book is a joy to read and a subtle reminder that life is an endless cycle--something every child needs to know.	2002-06-03

The animals look out at the reader solemnly, or engage in animal behavior without a second thought as to what the reader thinks.  They range from mammals to birds to reptiles and all sorts of other beasties.  It's a learning experience to read this wonderful book, and it's a treat to see how Yolen describes the animals in poetry.  Yolen and Lewin have a simpatico herein that invites readers in and makes them want to stay.<br />Very highly recommended!	2002-05-27

This story is about nine-year-old Stephen, a drummer, who goes off to do his duty to help save the Union during the Civil War.  It is a real shocker to get towards the end of the book--I won't give it away, but you may want to read this yourself first before sharing it with your children in case they are squeamish or scare easily.<br />Fortunately, the surprise turns out to become another, happier surprise and the book ends with Lewin telling the story of the real Stephen on whom his book is based.  Lewin's handsome watercolors deftly convey the heat, stickiness and tension of men awaiting battle, while at the same time being handsome in their own right.  His use of light within the forest scenes is really something to behold, and the pictures with many soldiers in them are amazing--each soldier has a different expression, with some of them apprehensive, some angry, some laughing, some wistful.  It's masterful work.<br />Any older child who is interested in the Civil War would enjoy this book, and any adult as well, if only for the superb illustrations and the interesting history of the real Stephen.	2002-05-27

Lincoln and Me\\" has the great good luck of being illustrated by Ted Lewin.  Author and painter work quiet miracles herein, with Borden's young boy reflecting on Lincoln and the similarities they share (not the least of which includes the same birthday).<br />Lewin makes a powerful impression here with his pencil sketches of Lincoln shadowing the boy throughout the book.  This deft use of pencil, juxtaposed with watercolor paintings of the boy, draw a subtle line between history and modernity, while the size differential (the boy is always smaller than is Lincoln) underscores Lincoln's importance, both in history and to the boy personally.  <br />Really very highly recommended for any child, especially those who have an interest in either Lincoln or the Civil War.	2002-05-27

Simultaneously, Rabbit worries that Hedgehog might be bothered by the sunlight while sleeping out in the open--so he packs up a mossy box of darkness.  Of course the pals are disappointed when they open their gifts, but they later figure out on their own the good wishes behind each gift--and the best way to put the gifts to real, everyday use.<br />Any small child can begin to learn from this book the secret of choosing to be happy with what you have, instead of worrying about what you don't have, and parents and kids alike will get a kick out of Chris Riddell's vivid illustrations.	2002-05-27

But the magic wand used to call Abiyoyo up breaks, and there is no way to get Abiyoyo to disappear again.  There is a Pandora's Box element to the tale, and the wisdom of elders is deftly interwoven with bright ideas contributed by the children in the village.  <br />Kids will get a special kick out of the idea that the young heroine--who looks to be maybe eight or ten years old--comes up with the idea that will allow the townspeople to peacefully co-exist with Abiyoyo, while still getting their dam built and the boulder removed.	2002-05-27

All come together to form a beautiful quilt which features dancing animals, swaying trees, and all manner of beautiful ornamentation.  <br />The quilt serves variously as a quilt, a tent, a huppah at a wedding, a tablecloth, and so on.  Polacco uses the same illustrative technique she employs in her wonderful \\"Betty Doll\\"--the quilt itself appears in multicolored beauty, while the rest of each picture is done in subtle and evocative pencil.  Because of this simple visual choice, the quilt and its many permutations leap to the fore and become, essentially, the main character in a story filled with realistic and full-bodied people.<br />I have always liked the fact that Polacco doesn't draw pretty-pretty people.  The little kids always look like regular little kids, with all the inherent awkwardness and realistic expressions (whether they be joyful or pouting or wondering), while the adults sometimes have worried or thoughtful expressions, bad posture, or wrinkles.  Real life is going on here, and Polacco manages to capture it vividly.	2002-05-27

Polacco opens the book by telling the reader about her mother dying and about packing up her belongings and then finally going through them a year later.  In some of the boxes Polacco packed up, she finds her mother's old, handmade cloth doll.  Wrapped around it is the letter her mother wrote while dying of cancer.<br />Now before you decide that this is NOT a book for children, you should know that the book overall has a joyous, shimmering quality.  The story concentrates on Betty Doll's travels and adventures, with Polacco deftly portraying Betty Doll in color while all else is in handsome but quiet black-and-white tones.  This brings Betty's story to the fore visually, but as far as the story itself goes, she serves as a backdrop for different generations of Polacco's family.<br />The story is true, and it rings true.  A little girl's love of her doll and the happiness she finds while playing with the doll come to the fore, as does the stability of Betty Doll throughout the changes of the little girl's life as she grows up, marries, and so on.  This is a fine way to gently ease into discussing the cancer of a family member with any young child, but it is also an absorbing tale in its own right and stands ably on its own, aided by Polacco's usual impeccable illustrations.	2002-05-27

Rylant relates the tale of Little Whistle--a guinea pig happily ensconced in a toy store--and the dinner party he throws for all his toy friends.  <br />Rylant takes the secret wish of every child (that toys really do come alive when we're not looking) and turns it into a vivacious party, complete with detailed party preparations.  Although the story ends on a rather abrupt note--to the point that I wondered if perhaps the last page had inadvertently been torn out of our copy--the story itself is so dear that children will hardly notice.<br />Tim Bowers does a super job of upping the adorability factor in this sweet book.  Recommended especially for children who own guinea pigs!	2002-05-27

Adele Sansone's text is a miracle of economy, covering parenthood, adoption, geneaology, and more with a minimum of fuss and text.  <br />The barnyard goose decides that he wants to be a father, but as he has no wife or other partner, he decides to adopt a spooky looking green egg found by the dog at the edge of a field.  The goose settles himself on top of the eggs and waits and waits.  When the egg finally cracks open, what emerges is some sort of lizard or dinosaur or who knows what--but it definitely is not a goose.  Still, Sansone's goose dad utterly ignores the differences between himself and his new son and makes a natural (and skillful) parent.  When the \\"green goose\\" decides to try to figure out what his real background is, he has little luck and ends up coming home to the goose--who, after all, is the only parent he's ever known.<br />The illustrations, by Alan Mark, are utterly charming.  The \\"green goose\\" is splotched and splashed with color, while the goose is drawn sparingly and convincingly.  This is, overall, a fun tale with subtle and valuable life lessons.	2002-05-27

The true tale of a brave cat which ended up saving a baby during a 15th-century flood in southern Holland, \\"Katje the Windmill Cat\\" begins quietly enough with Katje and her owner, Nico, enjoying the solitude of windmill life together.  They play together, eat together, and even cozy up together at night.  Both are content.<br />Then Nico brings home a bride, and soon enough, there is a baby girl named Anneke.  Although Katje feels a little pushed aside, she does her best to amuse and take care of the baby.  Her efforts are not always appreciated by Lena, Nico's wife, but all is forgiven when, at the end, Katje saves the day and Anneke alike.<br />Nicola Bayley's superb, softly colored illustrations greatly enhance the text.  Pictures of the cat and her family subtly boost the story, as do the utterly charming Delft tile squares on each page--some depicting cats, some windmills, some dikes, and so on.  This is a lovely story for almost any age, and the illustrations bring fresh visual rewards with each viewing (try finding the mice scattered throughout!).	2002-05-27

If they like to cook but dont necessarily have a huge culinary library, Abigail Kirschs \\"The Bride and Grooms First Cookbook\\" might be the gift you want to give.<br />Abigail Kirsch wants you to know that she knows her stuff.  The inside back cover text tells us that she has trained at The Culinary Institute of America and Pariss Le Cordon Bleu, and that she is proprietor and chef of her own catering establishment.  Her catering experience includes having prepared meals for the Prince of Wales and literally thousands of parties and charity events.  The book is co-authored by Susan M. Greenberg, Kirschs sister-in-law and a professional freelance writer. <br />This is not the cookbook bridal couples (or, lets face it, just the brides) of a generation or two ago used.  It features dozens of recipes that are mostly simple, but elegantly named (sometimes to the point of ridiculous excess--the temptation to go through the book and cross out Double-Dipped Challah French Toast with Warm Poached Orange Syrup and write in Breakfast, Dummy is strong).  Still, this is evidence of Kirschs savvy in knowing her audience.  Many brides and grooms, especially young, naïve ones, want to make an impression when they cook, especially when they are entertaining guests.  These recipes allow them to do so, without being unduly difficult.<br />The book is laid out in sensible style, each chapter focusing on a different type of food (Soups and Salads, Fish and Shellfish, and so on).  While this puts something of a crimp in trying to cook seasonally, it is useful for planning the particular type of meal you want.  The menus section is a little too cutesy, with such frighteningly energetic-sounding titles as Tailgate Antics and A Howling Halloween, but again, this addresses many newlywedsidea of fun: theme entertaining, or How Best to Elicit the Most Compliments Possible with the Least Amount of Work Possible.  Kirsch provides a dollar-sign guide in this section to allow the beaming couple to entertain within their means, be they meager or grand.<br />Nothing is left to chance.  Each recipe is prefaced with the kitchenware necessary to prepare the dish, the amount of time the dish requires (both preparation and cooking), and how much of the recipe can be made in advance.  The instructions are followed with suggestions for serving, and tips on using the leftovers, or using the dish in a manner different from the original intentions.  <br />In addition to a checklist for a bridal registry, Kirsch includes a pantry wish list and a glossary of cooking terms used throughout the book.  The glossary is the least satisfactory portion of the book; several of the definitions are vague (she describes dice as to cut food into pieces smaller than a cube, as though cubes come in only one <br />size--whereas in reality, \\"to dice\\" comes from the idea of cutting food into cubes about the size of a gaming die).  A few of the terms are out-and-out incorrectly defined, a distressing feature in a book purporting to teach newlyweds how to cook.<br />The book is handsomely designed, with periwinkle blue text, whimsical line drawings, and a butter-yellow striped cover featuring--of course--a photograph of a radiant, giggling bridal couple confidently preparing something with blueberries, eggs, and a muffin tin, though I could find no listing for blueberry muffins in the book.  Im being too picky, I guess, but theyre not wearing wedding bands (are these folks really married, or what?), nor have they donned aprons, despite Kirschs warning on page 5 to always wear an apron.  <br />No matter.  \\"The Bride and Grooms First Cookbook\\" would make a thoughtful wedding or bridal shower gift, and might even provide some future favorite recipes for the blushingcouple you have in mind.  Its very title--that first--suggests an expectation of many other volumes keeping it company on the kitchen bookshelf.  That, and the well-chosen recipes within, gives you the best sense of Ms. Kirschs sense of generosity and inclusiveness.	2002-05-25

Dean &amp; DeLuca's vast stock of formerly unavailable (and frequently pretty esoteric) food goodies emboldened even the most timid of home chefs, and sharpened the sophistication of the New York appetite.<br />Written by television cooking show host and former GOURMET restaurant reviewer David Rosengarten, with considerable input from Dean and DeLuca themselves, &quot;The Dean &amp; DeLuca Cookbook&quot; is a compendium of nearly 600 recipes.  The recipes are divided into component-based sections, rather than seasonal chapters.  The dishes are unfailingly imaginative (sometimes perhaps too much so, substituting flash over substance), and Rosengarten has a highly developed flair for educating the reader in manageable bits and pieces with his ingredient and technique tips.<br />My only complaint is that there is nary an illustration in the entire book.  Because the act of eating employs all the senses, I expect any cookbook to reasonably approximate this experience, if only as a way of tempting me to try the recipes.  &quot;The Dean &amp; DeLuca Cookbook&quot; is filled with delicious-sounding stuff, but as an invitation to cook, it is a little too text-bookish and nose-to-the-grindstone.	2002-05-25

Berber farmers in southern Morocco bury a tightly-sealed pot of smen on the day of a daughter's birth, unearthing it years later to flavor the couscous served on her wedding day.\\"  <br />The recipes are surprisingly easy and well-thought-out, although the use of a bigger typeface would have been a good idea.  Laurie Smith's sumptuous photographs are especially to be commended.  Using a lens which seems to have perhaps been coated in honey, she manages to impart a golden, glowing, richly colored look to every dish she shot for this book.  \\"Cooking at the Kasbah\\" would not have been nearly as wonderful without Smith's photographic contributions.	2002-05-25

That said, I have a couple of minor quibbles with her cookbook.  How, for instance, can she possibly characterize her Warm Zabaglione with Strawberries as &quot;a light dessert for those watching their waistlines&quot; when one of the five ingredients is six egg yolks?  How can she instruct her readers to indefinitely refrigerate her Chocolate Nut Bark, when doing so almost ensures that it will absorb odors from other refrigerated items?  She also, in recipes employing the use of raw eggs, makes no mention of the dangers associated with eating them.<br />Fairly minor quibbles aside, though, &quot;Four-Star Desserts&quot; is a treat.  For all her formidable talent, Luchetti has a magical touch at creating recipes that even inexperienced cooks will feel confident in trying.  The recipes are nicely laid out with ingredients and required equipment on the left-hand half of the page, and instructions on the right.  Each is preceded with her thoughts on what makes that particular dessert memorable, as well as tips on making it as successful as possible.  Having Emily Luchetti at your elbow in the kitchen is a very good thing, as is this book.	2002-05-25

I will let Thompson speak for herself on the subject of her recipes, as she does it so eloquently:<br />&quot; . . . you can believe that when I bring a vegetable into the house, it's been hard come by.  You can be sure that I want to taste it . . . [Supermarket produce has been] raised and handled with one objective: To  get it into those bins without physical damage.  Flavor is not the point.  Flavor is the point when it comes to your kitchen garden.  In most books, vegetable recipes have been designed to disguise lackluster store-bought produce--it's smoke and mirrors with razzle-dazzle seasoning.  In other books, vegetables are but one element in a complex of ingredients creating a many-leveled taste.  In this book, there are no disguises; there's little that's complex.  I've gathered <BR>notions from all over the world to show off the flavor of your harvest simply.\\"<br />So although Thompson expects your diligence in the garden, she implores you to use a light and restrained hand in the kitchen.  Included among the recipes are Perfection of Baby Beets, Mustard Flavored Celeraic and Sweet Red Peppers, and Red Bean Ice Cream, among many others.  The recipes are graceful in their simplicity; in fact, most have six or fewer ingredients.<br />&quot;The Kitchen Garden Cookbook&quot; is an intelligent, useful, and instructive volume.  Sylvia Thompson, in having written this superior book and its companion &quot;The Kitchen Garden,&quot; has performed an invaluable service for every American gardener who also loves to cook.	2002-05-25

But for the thousands (millions?) who ate at the famed restaurant from its opening at the height of the Depression to the beginning of its 16-year hiatus in 1979, this book will evoke powerful memories. <br />Lundy's was an immense establishment, seating 2,800 patrons in its heyday, but the enormousness of the space was second to its food.  The food was not only excellent, according to nearly every source listed--the portions were in keeping with the grandiose feel of the building itself.  Author/historian Robert Cornfield writes, \\"The oddity is that for all its great size, simple fare, crows, and noise, Lundy's was not a cold, impersonal restaurant, but was replete with community excitement, curiosity, warmth, and the delirious happiness of a splendid holiday.\\"  <br />Lundy's was, for the mostly immigrant population of Brooklyn, New York, the pinnacle of the American experience: plenty, and plenty of it.  The recipes are mostly an adjunct to what amounts to a love letter written to the restaurant which fed Brooklyn's appetite for more of nearly everything.  This is a wonderful book for anyone who ever enjoyed a meal at Lundy's, and a necessary record of Brooklyn in the mid-20th century.	2002-05-25

She covers such neglected topics as contractual obligations of the contractors, kitchen lighting, countertop choices, and depth of storage cabinetry.<br />There is such an abundance of information herein that it would take-well, it would take a book to tell you all about it.

The book is divided into sections highlighting Asian greens, mustard greens, potherbs, and salad greens, with other entries being more descriptive: \\"Beans for Frying,\\" \\"Cooking and Slicing Onions,\\" and so forth.  <br />Each entry gives not only the most typical gardener's name for a plant, but the Latin name and any other monikers as well.  What follows each is her description of both the plant and her own experience with it; these miniature essays are the book's greatest pleasure, each being a deft weave of history, fact, and Thompson's own opinionated tips.  <br />If your particular corner of God's green earth is too dry, too shady, or too anything, you will still be able to find some sort of solution for your problem in the graphically beautiful and informative pages of &quot;The Kitchen Garden.&quot;	2002-05-25

There is a strong seafood tradition here, as well as a hearty embrace of meat.  A recipe for roast suckling pig is given, not to mention recipes for oxtails, braised rabbit, venison, and sundry organ meats.  I didn't happen to have a suckling pig handy, but the pinchos (like Spanish tapas) I made from these recipes were yummy.<br />Co-author Mary Goodbody is, as I understand it, adept at putting non-American cookbooks into American terms for ease of use.  If that was her job here, she did it superbly.  There's nothing the average (or even slightly less than average) American cook can't try in &quot;The Basque Table.&quot;<br />As for complaints that the book shows too much Spanish influence, all I can say is get out your globe and take a look.  The Basques live wedged between Spain and France so it's entirely natural that their cuisine would be heavily influenced by those two countries.  The beauty of the Basque cuisine is that it plucks what it likes from Spanish and French cooking and makes it wholly Basque.	2002-05-25

Such great volumes of text are spent trying to convince the reader of the sundry benefits of the vegetarian diet that the energy left over for recipes and recipe description is minimal (\\"This cheesy soy casserole is just so yummy!\\").  No, thanks.  <br />&quot;Vegetarian Planet,&quot; though, seems content to convince on the strength of its recipes.  I fell for this book partly because of the fact that it has an entire chapter on dumplings--from gnocchi to pierogis, from quenelles to pot-stickers--but the desserts also interested me, and so did the salads (in addition to these and others, there are also chapters on tortillas, pizza, and burgers and sandwiches).  <br />This is a lovely book, put together by a palate familiar with a wide range of cuisines and flavors, and smart enough to know how to combine them in some swinging recipes.   The recipes are terrific--the pasta recipes are especially to be recommended (try the one which uses as the sauce a puree of sweet red peppers and almonds--absolutely divine!).	2002-05-25

That's the case with Christopher Kimball and me.<br />Christopher Kimball founded and still edits COOK'S ILLUSTRATED magazine.  I always learn something from COOK'S.  Its laconic, thorough approach is Chris incarnate, and this unfussy spirit is echoed in &quot;The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook&quot; as well.  With its yellow-checked cover, an old-fashioned typeface (Poor Richard, perhaps?), and illustrations reminiscent of woodblock prints by Rockwell Kent or Barry Moser, this is a conscious visual effort to call up the gentle past.  <br />The recipes, however, are anything but nostalgic.  Chris flatly debunks assumption after assumption about recipes we thought we knew.  He is a demon tester, and has charted wonderful new paths to the same old dishes, making them bright and newly delicious in our mouths. Several &quot;Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook&quot; recipes have become family favorites in my home (especially the scalloped potatoes, which get requested on practically a weekly basis).

In addition to providing some excellent recipes, \\"Outlaw Cook\\" is just plain old good reading.      <br />I was first introduced to Thorne's writing years ago when a colleague gave me a copy of his first book, \\"Simple Cooking.\\"  \\"Simple Cooking\\" is a compilation of essays and recipes from his newsletter (by the same name), and it charmed me.  From the best essay I have ever read on cheesecake to the recounting of a long-ago romantic evening highlighted by the appearance of homemade Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, Thorne covered a wealth of disparate material and covered it all with an unstuffy and contagious isn't-this-fascinating spirit.  \\"Outlaw Cook\\" serves up more of the same delicious dish.<br />One of the most exhilarating things in \\"Outlaw Cook\\" is the chapter called \\"On Not Being a Good Cook.\\"  For a man who makes his living writing about food and cooking, this baldly titled essay is a brazen thing to include in a book that bears the imprimatur of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (it was a winner of one of the Julia Child Cookbook Awards).  Throwing down the gauntlet to the rarefied world of foodies (as food writers are commonly called), he begins the essay by asserting, \\"I'm not a good cook.\\"  He goes on:<br />\\" . . . if our criterion for goodness is whether I possess anything like a genuinely well-rounded repertoire of dishes I consistently prepare well, then my credentials are nothing much to boast about.  Quite honestly, this has never bothered me much at all . . . It's my experience that truly good cooks are born.  I was not born to be one, and I don't like being trained, especially if the result is going to be mere competency.  I've generally found life a lot more interesting learning to use my limitations than struggling to overcome them.\\"<br />Takethat, all you Cordon Bleu-trained snobs!  After all, most of us haven't been trained in cooking--except perhaps at a parent's knee, if we are lucky--so his comments, while surprising coming from a food writer, do apply to the majority of the general population.  The essay serves the dual purpose of endearing Thorne to his readers and emboldening them to share his defiance of the conventions of cookery.  <br />There are other goodies as well.  Thorne writes convincingly (if somewhat obsessively) about the need to bake bread in a wood-fired, outdoor oven.  He takes deadly aim at food writer Paula Wolfert and wickedly skewers Martha Stewart.  And as if the polished prose weren't enough, there are many worthwhile recipes; his takes on lemon ice cream, Texas toast, Swedish pea soup and pecan pie all leap to the fore.<br />Matt Lewis Thorne and John Thorne have, with \\"Outlaw Cook\\" produced a quiet classic of food writing that deserves to be on any thoughtful cook's bookshelf--or on the bedside table.  It's that good.	2002-05-25

The book cover usually features a photograph of some dessert guaranteed to strike fear in the heart of even the most intrepid baker, and recipes that promise to be the soul of simplicity frequently reveal themselves to be of a nature as involved and delicate as I would imagine hostage negotiations to be.  <BR> <BR>Ken Haedrich's \\"Simple Desserts\\" looked as though it might actually fulfill the promise held by its title.  Of course I expected that the book would hold at least a few recipes that required more than the attention span of a gnat; after all, if a book like \\"Simple Desserts\\" were 100% true to its title, you would open it to find one-sentence recipes along the lines of, \\"Have a nice apple.\\"  <br />As early as page 32, though, things begin to unravel.  Haedrich succumbs to the temptation of including a Mocha Brownie Cheesecake recipe he developed while making restaurant cheesecakes for a living.  He semi-apologetically writes:<br />\\" . . . this is not a snap to make . . . you must bake a crust and brownies ahead, and make the icing if you're using it . . .\\"  <br />Haedrich also includes a recipe for Dark Chocolate Fruitcake which requires a whopping 19 ingredients and an overnight rest, and a recipe for Steamed Black Chocolate Cake which, while it sounds lovely to eat, sounds ridiculous to make (lots of melting and cooling of different ingredients, a two-hour steam bath, and lots of checking of the water level during said steam bath.  I would imagine that along with this comes lots of chewing of the fingernails).   The Lemon Cheesecake Tartlets require the following:<br />\\"Cut 12 strips of wax paper 6 inches long by 3/4 inch wide.  Press 1 strip into each [muffin] cup, neatly tucked into the bottom seams.  It should run down the sides and across the bottom, with an even overhang on each side of the cup.\\"<br />Just the thought of having to do this makes me want to go stick my head out the window and scream.  You may rest assured that, delectable though they may be, these Lemon Cheesecake Tartlets will not be made anytime soon by yours truly.  <br />Haedrich thinks nothing of asking you to let a dessert sit before serving, frequently overnight, and fully half of his cookie recipes call for refrigerating the dough before baking.  In another cookbook, none of this would offend me in the slightest, but in one bearing the sunny subtitle of \\"Sweet Endings with a Carefree Spirit,\\" I have to say that sweet endings of this ilk make my carefree spirit start to deflate.<br />I have nothing against any of Haedrich's recipes themselves; they look fine, and some even have wonderful twists on the usual (Orange and Toasted Coconut Crème Brûlée and Semolina Cake with Olive Oil are among the many that intrigued me).  I do, however, have to take exception to the fact that quite a number of these were included in a book with the title \\"Simple Desserts.\\"  Certainly, simplicity is in the eye of the beholder--but it is fair to say that in order to really fit the book title, the ingredient list, the method of preparation, or the amount of time involved (or, preferably, all three) must be of a lucidity and a conciseness that even a kitchen neophyte could embrace.  That is simply (pun intended) not the case here.<br />That said, it is a pretty book to look at, and the directions seem mostly pretty clear.  Haedrich is particularly strong on fruit-based desserts, a rarity in our chocolate-obsessed society.  While I would recommend \\"Simple Desserts\\" as a nice compilation of yummy-sounding recipes, I would not consider getting it for a beginning cook--or even for a cook who is simply pressed for time.	2002-05-25

In &quot;Home Cooking,&quot; as in her other books, Colwin's writing charmingly combines an easy, conversational style, an innate curiosity and a good-natured disrespect for things fancy.  She was a decidedly unstuffy columnist for GOURMET magazine for some years, giving the magazine a needed breath of fresh air.<br />If you have not already partaken of the pleasures of reading Colwin's work, I urge you to buy a copy of &quot;Home Cooking.&quot;  Colwin is insouciant, opinionated and very funny.  My favorite chapter in &quot;Home Cooking&quot; is entitled \\"Repulsive Dinners: A Memoir\\".  It begins:<br />\\"There is something triumphant about a really disgusting meal.  It lingers in the memory with a lurid glow, just as something exalted is remembered with a kind of mellow brilliance...I am thinking about meals that are positively loathsome from soup to nuts, although one is not usually fortunate enough to get either soup or nuts.\\"<br />With great relish, Colwin describes several perfectly horrid meals, the most striking of which is a variation of the medieval starry gazey pie, \\"in which the crust is slit so that the whole baked eels within can poke their nasty little heads out and look at the piecrust stars with which the top is supposed to be festooned.\\"<br />The recipes in &quot;Home Cooking&quot; seem almost like afterthoughts to her meanderings on entertaining, home and hearth, and disguising vegetables, but they are mostly very good and always very simple.  Colwin's gingerbread recipe is particularly delicious, and will make your house smell like a Christmas party.  Highly recommended both as a cozy read and as a source of reliable recipes.  We lost her too young, but Laurie Colwin lives on in &quot;Home Cooking&quot; and her other fine books.	2002-05-25

If you are among this group, you will rejoice at Nancy Ring's evocative memoir, \\"Walking on Walnuts.\\"  This lovely book braids delectable recipes (Burnt Orange Ice Cream, Peach and Honey Upside-Down Cake, among many others) together with tales of the author's family and the story of her own path towards professional and personal fulfillment.<br />Nancy Ring held a number of positions as pastry chef in some of New York City's finest restaurants, all without benefit of culinary school training.  She learned to bake from her grandmothers, and she learned to create recipes from her own imagination.  Her progress from utter novice to confident chef is fascinating, especially because she never seeks to pull the wool over her readers' eyes.  She knows she's inexperienced, and she's not above naïveté and wonder as she traverses the Manhattan restaurant world--a world which shows its magic to the public and saves its horrors for those who create the magic.  This only adds to the absorbing narrative tension of the story.<br />To protect the innocent and not-so-innocent, Ring has altered the names of the restaurants which employed her, as well as the names of most of her co-workers.  My favorite section takes place in the first restaurant to take a chance on Ring's as-yet-unproved baking talents; she works under a sassy woman named Arana who takes relish in appearing at the restaurant's staff holiday party dressed as a formally set dinner table:<br />\\"She walked straight up to the chef and placed herself directly in front of him.  Arana was very tall, and in those heels she towered over the chef, who stood barely over five feet.  Her breasts were nearly exactly level with his eyes.  When I tell you the crowd was disintegrated in laughter, I mean it.  'Arana,' the chef said in a tone somewhere between shock and appreciation . . . 'This is a party, not a watermelon sale.'  Knock-down, all-out, knee-slapping laughter.  Somebody yelled, 'Touché!'  'Hmmpf,' said Arana, real Mae West style, 'don't you know what I am?' . . . 'No, I don't,' he laughed.  Arana stood with her hands on her hips, glaring at the crowd until they quieted a little.  Then, when she was sure they would all hear her, she turned back to the chef, enjoying her captive and her audience. 'Would you like a bite?' she smirked.  'I'm the tart of the day.' \\"<br />This is the type of book you immediately want to go out and buy for friends.  Ring's own illustrations punctuate each chapter; in addition to being a pastry chef and writer, she is a talented artist.  I can hardly imagine a more enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys cooking as much as they enjoy a fast-moving, well-plotted story.	2002-05-25

It is one of the earliest works of English literature I can think of which has a fully rounded, fully independent, fully human female protagonist.  Bathsheba Everdene runs a farm, is only semi-aware of her own extraordinary beauty, and is pursued by three very different men throughout the course of the book.<br />&quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; may, in some sense, be the model for every cheapo drugstore romance novel ever written, but it is a classic for the very simple and very good reason that it transcends the genre it may have helped to start.  Bathsheba's trials, in love and elsewhere, are completely realized, with terrific detail.  Hardy has a powerful understanding of human nature and makes each of the characters both deep and broad, both simple and complex, both good and filled with fault.  The result is a story with many characters, each of whom is as full-blooded and human as a reader could hope.  It's a book which bears reading again and again, as each new reading shows the reader new detail and new depth not previously seen.  A more three-dimensional character study may not exist in novel form--and the beauty of it is that all this terrific character examination is done against the backdrop of a wonderful plot as well.  You really couldn't ask for a more richly satisfying novel.	2002-05-24

In &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; he blends both fiction and fact with the stunning result being a narrative which shows us, from many points of view, just how one person is judged by the community in which he lives.<br />Set in the close quarters of the Florida Everglades in the early 1900s, the novel examines one Edgar J. Watson (an actual figure about whom little is known).  His neighbors, friends and family each offer up their take on the mysterious Mr. Watson, who may or may not be a murderer, who may have come by his fortune in roundabout and not entirely legal ways, who may be everything he seems to be and may be someone else entirely.  The Florida setting is key--just as the local swamps nurture all manner of plantlife, so do the heat and sun and lack of population nourish all manner of outrageous opinion and gossip about Mr. Watson.  <br />Matthiessen uses the narrative to great effect, presenting Mr. Watson in first this light, then this, then another light altogether.  The ultimate effect is almost that of a magician's illlusion--all smoke and mirrors--everything sounds plausible until you read the next thing, which makes you question everything that's gone before.<br />Narrative technique aside, this is just a gripping read.  Mr. Watson speeds unknowingly towards his fate--which may surprise you--just as the reader speeds towards the end, wanting--needing--to know what happens to this enigmatic and utterly fascinating man.  &quot;Killing Mr. Watson&quot; is a novelistic achievement of the first order.	2002-05-24

Typically for Polacco, she weaves magic with her illustrations and makes the story intriguing as well. <BR> <BR>\\"Mean Gene\\" is the bully of the school, the one who has been taught to hate anyone different from himself.  But Gene has also been taught, by his grandfather, to identify and love birds.  He knows everything about birds, from the types of trees they like to nest in to the kind of food they need to eat.  Mr. Lincoln latches onto this talent and nurtures it, asking Gene to be in charge of figuring out what should go into the school's atrium.  As Gene eventually blossoms, so do the ducks who live in the atrium--and as he helps herd the ducklings towards the pond, so is he led by Mr. Lincoln towards greater understanding and tolerance.  <BR> <BR>This is a lovely book for just about any age.  Younger kids can just enjoy the pictures, while older kids may want to discuss the idea of prejudice and consequences for actions.  It's a treat to see a black principal with a whole culturally diverse student body, too.  Highly recommended.	2002-05-14

Jane Yolen's charming, short, and quiet story is so beautifully complemented by John Schoenherr's watercolor illustrations that it's as if they had some sort of mental telepathy with each other.  <br />A lovely story for bedtime because of its quiet mood, \\"Owl Moon\\" tells of a little girl and her father who go \\"out owling\\"--walking quietly into the woods to hoot for owls and see if any show up.  The little girl, whose name we never know, understands the importance of watching and waiting, of not complaining about cold toes, and of forgoing sleep and comfort to see something wild and beautiful that few people ever get to see.  The larger lesson, of course, is that these are good rules for life in general.  <br />Schoenherr's masterful use of blues and whites convey the sense of chilliness, dark, and snow perfectly.  You almost want to pull on your mittens before reading the book.  Highly recommended for all ages.	2002-05-05

She comes all the way from County Clare, Ireland to be a mail-order bride in Lizard Lick, Texas, only to find that her bridegroom--who bears the wonderful name of Virgil Beetle--is a tobacco-chewing cad who lives with his awful family and who doesn't give a hoot what she thinks or feels.  <br />After biding her time with the Beetles until a preacher can be found, Ernestine boldly decides to make a quick getaway disguised as a cowboy.  She meets up with the cowboy Texas Teeth and they have some adventures together herding cattle before eventually falling in love. <br />Although the illustrations are colorful, they verge on amateurishness.  But the story is well told, and author/illustrator Nicole Rubel has obvious affection for her subject, and that makes all the difference.  Lots of fun for any little kid who's ever pretended to be a cattle-herdin' cowgirl or cowboy.	2002-05-05

Anne Isaacs has written a yarn that seems somehow to have been in the pantheon all along--much like Howard Pyles' \\"Pepper and Salt\\" stories, \\"Swamp Angel\\" is new as far as children's stories go, but has all the elements of the classic stories and so seems older and as wonderfully distinctive as the tales that have been around for generations.<br />Isaacs tells us all about one red-headed, freckled young woman named Angelica Longrider.  From the first, we know we are in for a wild ride when we see the picture of her rather startled-looking parents holding an enormous but contented baby--the text tells us calmly that Angelica was \\"scarcely taller than her mother and couldn't climb a tree without help.\\"  Things start moving at a pell-mell pace when we find out that a destructive black bear has so annoyed folks all around the Appalachian mountains of Tennessee that a reward has been offered for his hide.  Angelica sets up to whup that bear and means to do the job right.<br />The fight between Angelica and the bear is a wondrous portion of the story, told with great good humor, a number of winks at the reader, and the astonishing illustrations of Paul O. Zelinsky.  \\"Swamp Angel\\" may well be Zelinsky's masterpiece.  The pictures have the flavor of early American folk art, combined to great effect with Zelinsky's usual eye for telling detail and gorgeous use of color.  They fit the style of the story so well and complement the action so sufficiently that it's as though Isaacs and Zelinsky are two halves of the same person.  Rarely do the visions of both author and illustrator dovetail as cleanly as they do here, and it's our great good luck as readers that Isaacs and Zelinsky found each other.  Three cheers for \\"Swamp Angel!\\"	2002-05-05

Zelinsky doesn't shy away from the grimness in this Grimm tale, and lets us see Rapunzel's naivete, her captivity, and her castigation without blinking.  This may be a little too strong for some little readers, but it is truer to the original Brothers Grimm story than many other versions of the Rapunzel story.<br />Zelinsky captures the tale beautifully with his meticulously detailed illustrations, moving with ease and skill from the sensuous wilderness of the witch's garden (where Rapunzel's father goes to gather up the herb rapunzel for his pregnant wife to eat) to the austerity of Rapunzel's tower room.  Rapunzel and her lover are portrayed as clear-eyed yet star-crossed lovers, not as cardboard fairy tale inhabitants.  Zelinsky does much to humanize this often horrifying tale.  Highly recommended.	2002-05-05

Patricia MacLachlan captures the stillness and quietude of a rural life in her sweet tale of a boy waiting for his sister to be born so that he can teach her where \\"all the places to love\\" are.  Mike Wimmer does a superb job of making his realistic painted illustrations harmonize with MacLachlan's text.  The scene where Eli is in the barn with his grandfather waiting for his sister Sylvia to be born has such a beautiful Wimmer illustration that it never fails to take my breath away.  If the people are perhaps somewhat idealized--just minutes after giving birth, the mom looks golden, serene and ready for her close-up--then so is the story, and that's OK.  It gives kids something to dream about, whether or not they're awaiting the arrival of a new sibling.  Really and truly captivating.	2002-05-03

Jerdine Nolen's story is fun and plays off a child's natural curiosity.  The story is great--a little girl spies on the farmer of a balloon farm to figure out exactly how he grows those balloons (and, of course, it turns out that he uses good old-fashioned magic).  But what really makes this book a stand-out are Mark Buehner's superb illustrations.  Slyly employing a style and upright look that recalls both Grant Wood and Edward Hopper, Buehner turns the volume up by using super-saturated colors--perfect for a book about magic and balloons.  There is almost more humor and wonder in the pictures than in the text.  I highly recommend this book, especially for budding artists.  The pictures are just a joy to gaze upon and enjoy.	2002-04-30

Palatini has taken the \\"Dum de dum dum\\" theme from TV's long-ago \\"Dragnet\\" and applied it here to a barnyard mystery.  Sounds simple, and simplistic, but she soars in weaving into the story all sorts of fairy tale and nursery rhyme goodies--not to mention wonderful wordplay, like:<br />\\"A lot of squawking going on down in the coop area, Ducktective Web.  Looks like fowl play.  Report says feathers are flying.  Chief says we should check out the chicks.\\"<br />\\"Chicks?\\"<br />\\"Check.\\"<br />\\"Let's fly.\\"  DUM DE DUM DUM . . .<br />Palatini works in Peter Piper and his pack of pickled peppers (upping the ante by calling them perfect and purple as well), a falsely accused Little Boy Blue who offers the alibi that HE didn't do it because he was under the haystack, fast asleep--which the witnesses then confirm with: \\"The sheep were in the meadow.  Cows in the corn.\\"  Swing back again quickly to the \\"Dragnet\\" end of things and the author makes one of the suspects an actual Dirty Rat (aptly named Ratzo).<br />This is fun for children and possibly even more fun for their baby boomer parents.  It's a great read.	2002-04-28

Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city.  But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on.  Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us.  Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning.  Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child.  Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler.	2002-04-27

When my kids were toddlers, my husband and I used to \\"pancake\\" them--pretend to pour them out of a ladle, smooth them out on a griddle, flip them, then \\"pour syrup\\" over them and nibble on them.  They thought this was absolutely hilarious and would get breathless with laughter.  William Steig explores the same idea in this wonderful book, but has the father turning the son into a pizza instead.  The father/son interaction--especially because both are so serious at playing this game--is both hilarious and touching.  By the time the game is done, the sun has come out and Pete can go out and play with his friends after all--while carrying the happy memory of being \\"pizza-ed\\" by his dad.	2002-04-26

The calm, clear-eyed text and the evocative watercolor paintings balance and enhance each other beautifully.<br />Rylant doesn't shy away from the harder truths of Appalachian living.  About coal mining, she writes, \\"Many [Appalachians] are coal miners because the mountains in Appalachia are full of coal which people want and if you are brave enough to travel two miles down into solid dark earth to get it, somebody will pay you money for your trouble.\\"  On the facing page from this plainspoken truth is a haunting Barry Moser watercolor of a green-clad coal miner, his eyes weary and his skin gritty with coal dust, his lunchpail resting beside him.  <br />The beauties come through, too.  Rylant writes, \\"Morning in these houses in Appalachia is quiet and full of light and the mountains out the window look new, like God just made them that day.\\"  Throughout the book is a sense of quiet and purpose and appreciation for a way of life most of us will never know.  It's a moving and transfixing read.	2002-04-03

Cookbook: Absolutely Unbeatable Knock-'em-Dead Recipes for the Very Best Dishes	Books	5	24	26	N	N	A huge pleasure to read and cook from	For those of us who like to lie in bed and read cookbooks like other people read novels, Ann Hodgman's superb &quot;Beat This!&quot; is a surefire winner.  You will find yourself nudging your bed partner to read aloud the funny parts--which is most of the book (I can't think of any other cookbooks you'd want to read aloud from, with the exception of Hodgman's wonderful sequel, aptly entitled &quot;Beat That!&quot;).  <br />Hodgman has been launched from the late lamented SPY magazine to writing cookbooks and although her trajectory might seem a little strange, I think she has landed exactly where she should.  I love this woman AND her cookbooks!  The title of the book refers to Hodgman's challenge to readers to come up with better recipes than she provides herein.  It's a real challenge, believe me--everything I've tried from both this cookbook AND the sequel has been wonderful.<br />I can't finish this review without quoting at least briefly from Hodgman.  The woman is a hoot:<br />[On Mom-Style Chocolate Cake] &quot;This cake is straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting, but it tastes even better than . . . uh . . . paint and canvas, I guess.  Even for a nice traditional cake, the best mixing method can be found in Rose Levy Beranbaum's 'Cake Bible,' which is such a good book that I think the Gideons should put it in hotel rooms instead of the regular Bible.&quot;<br />[on Perfect Fudge, if You're Lucky] &quot;My problem has always been that 50% of the fudge I make turns out creamy and delicious, and 50% turns out like chips of flint.&quot;<br />[On The Best Regular (Or I Guess I Should Say Classic) Apple Pie] &quot;Remind me why people like apple pie so much?  Well, partly because of the cinnamon, or at least that's why I like it.  It took a McDonald's apple pie, of all things, to make me realize how important cinnamon is.  (I'm saying 'of all things' to make it sound as though I never eat at McDonald's.)&quot;<br />Buy this book and cook and laugh--what a greatcombination!	2002-04-03

The titles refer to the gauntlet flung down by Hodgman, challenging any and all to come up with a better recipe for, say, corn chowder (she calls hers &quot;milkish, but not milkoid&quot;), pasta salad, oatmeal cookies, and so on.<br />Some fun selections from Hodgman's kookily ruminative head notes on the recipes:<br />[On Bacony Split Pea Soup] &quot;I know we all need to eat lower on the food chain, and at my house we're trying.  Still, there's no denying that any split pea soup tastes a thousand times better with a hefty dose of smoked meats.  This recipe gives you double value--bacon AND a ham hock.&quot;<br />[On Mrs. Westerman's Almond Pastry] &quot;Where is Mrs. Westerman these days?  When I was growing up, she was a friend of my mother's who made wonderful Christmas ornaments and also this wonderful almond pastry.  In one cookbook I've seen, this recipe is called 'Spanish Breakfast Pastry.'  I beg to differ!  Mrs. Westerman is not Spanish!&quot;<br />The book's recipes are frankly and proudly eclectic, as is Hodgman's sense of humor.  She has the gift of sounding as though she's sitting right next to you as you read--her conversational writing style is absolutely a hoot, and the recipes work.  Every single one that I've tried has been a keeper, which is more than I can say for a lot of more uppity-crust cookbooks out there.	2002-04-03

I haven't tried every single recipe in the book, but I've made many of them and have yet to be disappointed.  <br />What really shines through here is Malgieri's intelligence and his people skills.  It's clear that his experience as a pastry teacher at Peter Kump's cooking school in Manhattan gives him a voice of authority and a sense of purpose and confidence.  He is a master at relaying information in a manner that is not only clear and concise, but that makes it sound--well, not easy, perhaps, but definitely doable.  This kitchen classic is aimed at every cook from beginner to professional chef.

Malgieri doesn't spell every tiny little thing out for you (there's very little of the hand-holding and overly detailed directions that are in most cookbooks nowadays).  Where he excels is in making you feel that, you, too could turn out the gorgeous baked goods in the book with a little bit of effort and a minimum of fuss.<br />Especially fine are the recipes for Raspberry and Almonds Tarts and Chocolate Chestnut Buche de Noel.

I can't say too much more or I'll give away the tear-inducing ending.  <br />It's short--you can read it with or without a child on your lap in perhaps ten minutes.  But the emotions it provokes are powerful, and powerfully enhanced by Jonathan Linton's astonishing paintings.  Evans has a note at the beginning of the book saying that although a different illustrator had been selected for \\"The Dance,\\" he happened to see the cover painting (by Linton) somewhere and felt strongly that Linton should illustrate the book.  Thank goodness Evans went to bat for Linton, as the text and pictures mesh beautifully.  I can't think of a girl, young or old, who wouldn't enjoy \\"The Dance\\"--and I can think of lots of dads who would get a little emotional reading through it themselves.

She thinks her parents are from another planet and gets fed up with her friends, whom she thinks are unbelievably selfish--though they are just like her.<br />The twist here is that Georgia's parents have decided to move from England to New Zealand.  Tragedy!  Not when she's just gotten a boyfriend!  The book follows Georgia's efforts to try to dissuade her parents, keep her sister out of her room, get her wacko cat Angus off her leg, and maintain a beautifully rendered teenage relationship with the hunkalicious Robbie.  The book is lots of fun whether or not you've read \\"Angus, Thongs, Etc.\\" and a good, quick read.	2002-03-19

Anne Lamott is such a terrific writer in so many ways. She has the driest, funniest way of putting things and she melds her spiky, sparkling humor here with her instructions on writing. The book came out of a writing class she'd taught, but even readers not the slightest bit interested in learning how to write will benefit from reading Lamott's book. After all, it is subtitled, \\"Some Instructions on Writing and Life.\\" Some of the gems herein:<br />\\"The very first thing I tell my new students on the first day of a workshop is that good writing is about telling the truth. We are a species that needs and wants to understand who we are. Sheep lice do not seem to share this longing, which is one reason they write so very little.\\"<br />\\"My Al-Anon friend told me about the frazzled, defeated wife of an alcoholic man who kept passing out on the front lawn in the middle of the night. The wife kept dragging him in before dawn so the neighbors wouldn't see him, until finally an old black woman from the South came up to her one day after a meeting and said, 'Honey? Leave him lay where Jesus flang him.' And I am slowly, slowly in my work--and even more slowly in real life--learning to do this.\\"<br />\\"[In publication,] there are arenas full of potential for rich reward, where your life and your sense of self and of abundance really can be changed. (All of a sudden I cannot remember if we are allowed to use the word 'abundance' in California anymore. I will have to get back to you on this.)\\"<br />Lamott is so self-deprecating and thoughtful and slyly funny that it's like the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down--you realize you've learned something without any of the attendant boring parts. It's all, all good here.	2002-03-19

This is zany madcap humour.&quot;<br />With that immortal exchange, nearly everything Pythonian is summed up.  For those who haven't memorized every single Python skit (or for those who have and who are looking to free up some short-term memory), this book and its companion volume (&quot;All The Words, Volume I&quot;) are must-haves.  Every single word from every single bit ever done on &quot;Monty Python's Flying Circus&quot; is in here.  It's a joy and a treasure and a non-stap laff riot.<br />Every Python nut is familiar with the &quot;wink, wink, nudge, nudge&quot; tale, the dead parrot sketch, the Ministry of Silly Walks and so on.  But even beyond these justly famed classics, there is wonderfully silly stuff herein.  I never realized until buying this and the companion Volume I how utterly the Python crew had mastered the gorgeously silly non-sequiter.  To wit:<br />&quot;Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever?&quot;<br />&quot;Don't call me señor!  I'm not a Spanish person.  You must call me Mr. Biggles, or Group Captain Biggles, or Mary Biggles if I'm dressed as my wife, but never señor.&quot;<br />&quot;I'm afraid we are unable to show you any more of that letter.  We continue with a man with a stoat through his head.&quot;<br />&quot;Were you worried when his head started to come loose?&quot;<br />It just doesn't get any better than this, and being able to sit and peruse the scripts without watching the frenetic activity on the screen only goes to strengthen the generally accepted view that these guys were genius writers.  As the book back states, these volumes are the winners of &quot;the 1989 PYTHON PRIZE for their own books.&quot;  ARE there higher honors than this?	2002-03-19

I haven't been a teenager in years, but I giggled and snorted all the way through. Georgia Nicolson makes a typically cranky, thoughtful, figuring-it-all-out teenager and she's English to boot, which makes all the BRIDGET JONES' DIARY comparisons make sense--but readers should remind themselves that BRIDGET JONES' DIARY came out AFTER Louise Rennison's books.<br />Typical teenage worries--spots (zits to us Americans), kissing boys, fashion, homework, and weird teachers all populate this book as things about which Georgia spends her time worrying. This will strike a chord with anyone who's ever been a teenage girl--and even some who haven't.	2002-03-19

The Mister Bubble correspondence is a classic in which Toth complains to the Mister Bubble company that he doesn't  understand how he is supposed to make use of their product when the box clearly states, &quot;KEEP DRY.&quot;  The ensuing letters back and forth are golden comedy.	2002-03-18

It briskly trots the globe from Austria (Walnut Chocolate Torte) to France (Reine de Saba, or Queen?s Cake) to Mexico (Aztec Devil?s Food Cake) to Hungary (Rigo Jancsi).  Naturally there are scores of prototypically American cakes too, from Pillsbury Bake-Off finalists to cheesecakes and beyond.  <br />Urvater came to write her cookbook in a roundabout manner.  After having spent years working as a chef, hosting television programs on cooking and so on, she decided to enroll in New York City?s famed French Culinary Institute.  After having earned her FCI diploma as a pastry chef, she had a new, more specialized outlook on her work.  <br />Despite her considerable expertise, Urvater doesn?t scare off the home cook who has never made anything other than a boxed mix before.  In fact, the book is a calming presence in the kitchen.  ?Chocolate Cake? is arranged so that the easiest cakes are in the beginning.  One wonderful recipe called Wacky Chocolate Cake is an excellent start for any beginner, and is particularly well-suited to a child baking with minimal adult supervision (my 7-year old and 4-year old actually made it ALL BY THEMSELVES--all I did was read the directions out loud to them and preheat the oven--an added bonus of this cake is that it's eggless, perfect for times when you need to serve dessert to someone with an egg allergy or cholesterol problems).  All the cakes have a degree of difficulty indicated--one star denotes easy, two stars intermediate, and three stars advanced.<br />Urvater is relaxed about her chocolate choices.  She prefers bittersweet chocolate to any other kind, but admits that when it comes to unsweetened chocolate, ?Any one of the national brands is acceptable.  At various times I have used Baker?s, Nestle?s, and Hershey?s unsweetened chocolate.  I tend to buy the cheapest one.?<br />What kind of niche does a book like ?Chocolate Cake? occupy in a world where anyone can pick up a very decent cake at the bakery or even the grocery store?  It will give pleasure to the experienced baker who wants to round out her repetoire with more dessert recipes, but it will also give confidence to the inexperienced cook who wants to make something splendid for a special someone's birthday.  My only complaint is that I would have preferred more photographs--but overall, this is a super book.	2002-03-18

The very first chapter--&quot;The Night the Bed Fell&quot;--begins with the laconic observation, &quot;I suppose that the high-water mark of my youth in Columbus, Ohio, was the night the bed fell on my father.&quot;  <br />Thurber goes on to explain how his grandmother felt that electricity leaked if not plugged up, a preoccupation that kept her busy filling in every gap in every lamp or outlet in the house.  <br />All the chapters are pretty much entitled with the name of some highlight of Thurber's Ohio youth: &quot;The Day the Dam Broke&quot; and &quot;The Night the Ghost Got In&quot; and that sort of thing.  What the chapters all have in common is that Thurber is a brilliant storyteller who manages to make the most plebian, everyday happenings matters of sparkling humor.	2002-03-18

For anyone who knows him only as the author of the Willy Wonka books--or who thinks of him purely as a children's book author--this is the book to change your mind and make you think admiringly about Dahl's considerable powers as an adult writer.<br />The book is comprised of gem after gem.  Two of Dahl's most famous stories are here.  One is \\"Lamb to the Slaughter,\\" about the wife of a police detective who kills her husband in a most unconventional way and then disposes of the murder weapon in a manner that would make any criminal proud.  The other, \\"Nunc Dimittis,\\" describes the lengths to which a society smoothie goes for revenge.  <br />Dahl's descriptive powers are basic, but his imagination is limitless.  He manages to calmly, smoothly pull you into his stories and make the most outrageous things seem perfectly in keeping and perfectly normal--while still just a bit askew.  <br />The stories are all vintage Dahl.  Each has elements of the macabre and the grotesque, couched in the comfortable trappings of middle-class life: marriage, tidy houses, bills, resentment, secrets, tidy houses, and so on.  Dahl pulls off the neat trick of making the macabre laughable, though--he's not trying to scare the reader as much as make us shout with laughter and recognition and then settle back to enjoy a shiver of anticipation.  In \\"William and Mary,\\" the terminally ill narrator is propositioned by a neurosurgeon friend to give his brain up for experimentation after death.  Despite the gruesome details, the story is hilarious:<br />\\" . . . So when I get you on the table I will take a saw, a small oscillating saw, and with this I shall proceed to remove the whole vault of your skull.  You'd still be unconscious at that point so I wouldn't have to bother with anaesthetic.\\"<br />\\"Like hell you wouldn't,\\" I said.<br />\\"You'd be out cold, I promise you that, William.  Don't forget you DIED just a few minutes before.\\"<br />\\"Nobody's sawing off the top of my skull without an anaesthetic,\\" I said.<br />Dahl doesn't get any better than this!	2002-03-17

This she does with a casual and unstudied authority.<br />Each of the chapters herein is about food or something relating to it.  While not strictly a cookbook--there's too much non-culinary text for that--it's also not strictly a memoir, even though it's about her family.  <br />Whatever you want to call it, it works.  Each chapter starts out with a pungent quotation from one of her wacky family members.  The chapter on Key lime pie quotes West's Aunt Tempe as sternly warning a woman, &quot;Feed a man lemon pie if you want him to confess his secrets.  Feed him brownies if you're in the mood for kissing.  But beware of the Key lime pie.  It's the food of infidels.&quot;  This is a fun, fun read and the recipes are good, too!	2002-03-17

There are stories of love, loss, regret, joy, sorrow, and growing up.  The subjects that bring on these emotions are as varied as a pet bird, a sharp slap from a parent, a new piece of clothing, a weekend alone at the beach, a party in which the increasingly annoying guest of honor gets his face pushed into the cake, a reconnection with a former lover, a loose car tire, and a harrowing audition for a sleazy adult film.  <br />Some of the stories are flatly told, facts laid out on the page.  Others take loving care with the details.  Either way, the accretion of all the stories gives the reader a most satisfying sense of membership by the end of the book--membership in the human race.	2002-03-17

Demands for gold!  Artistic genius!  Secret chemical experiments!  No, it's not science fiction and it's not a tale by Hans Christian Andersen or the Brothers Grimm.  It's the true story of how porcelain came to the western world and changed it: artistically, economically, politically.  <br />You don't need to be remotely interested in porcelain or European history to be drawn in by this superb account of porcelain's western origins.  As European nobility competed in ever more rarefied circles for prestige and power, the quest for making porcelain like that perfected by the Chinese became the preferred avenue for cementing one's social position.  Gleeson tells the tale of Johann Bottger, an unfortunate young man who bragged once too often of his supposed alchemical powers.  His boasts caught the ear of German Prince Augustus, who had Bottger kidnapped, set him up with a lab while keeping him incarcerated, and demanded that Bottger figure out how to produce porcelain.  After many, many years and many, many false starts, Bottger did just that and the course of European history was unalterably changed.  This is an absolutely fascinating story, told at a breakneck pace and with wonderful detail.	2002-03-17

It resides at Windsor Castle, as it has since being constructed there.  Designed by Edward Lutyens (famous for his graceful furniture), the house is a reproduction of Windsor Castle right down to the last nail--almost literally.  <br />David Cripps' photography beautifully captures the interiors of this amazing dollhouse, from the grand to the plebian.  Here is the linen closet, each batch of towels tied with different-colored ribbon to denote whether they were intended for the nursery, the staff, or the kitchen.  Here is a lacquer cabinet with gilded stand, dovetailed working drawers, and gold-leafed decoration.  Here is a bed, complete with pillows, bolsters, sheets, blankets, and even a tiny walnut-handled bedwarmer.  The toilet, complete with toilet paper discreetly placed in a bowl alongside, really works.  The toothbrushes are made of ivory and have bristles made from the hair of a goat's inner ear.  In the cellar, bottles of Chateau Margaux are properly corked and waxed and labeled.  The pantry shows real bows of Fry's Chocolates sharing space with McVitie & Price biscuits, barley sugar candies in hefty glass candy jars, and Frank Cooper's Seville Marmalade in squat jars tied with brown paper and string.  <br />The garage houses a miniature bicycle with brakes \\"in perfect working order,\\" not to mention a Rudge motorcycle and sidecar, a seven-seater Rolls Royce limousine-landaulet, a Vauxhall, a \\"Sunbeam open tourer,\\" and two Daimlers.  Gorgeous royal crests are hand-painted on each.  The house even has its own petrol pumps and fire appliances, as was normal for large houses in that era.<br />The house's garden is splendid despite the absence of a single living thing.  The lawn, made of cut green velvet, boasts several tiny mowers (both motor-powered and not), and the nearby garden has its own lovely benches, hoes, spades and the like.  There is even a robin's nest, complete with eggs, and a tiny, tiny snail.<br />Perhaps the most extraordinary thing in the house is the book collection.  Famous authors were asked to contribute their own works.  Arthur Conan Doyle obliged by submitted \\"How Watson Learned the Trick,\\" an original 500-word short story done in his own handwriting.  The bookplates for each of the books were designed by beloved Winnie-the-Pooh illustrator Ernest Shepard.  Rudyard Kipling submitted not only two poems, but illustrated them himself as well.  Other well-known authors who gave their own works to the Queen's house included G. K. Chesterton, Joseph Conrad, Robert Graves, Aldous Huxley, Hilaire Belloc, Rose Macauley, W. Somerset Maugham, and Vita Sackville-West.  Topping off the fine works of this distinguished crowd are the leather-bound autograph books--one each for famous folks from stage and screen, famous folks from the military, and famous politicans.  <br />There is even a room for storing the scepter, crowns and other regalia--all featuring flawless gemstones!<br />The details are endlessly fascinating and the house and its furnishings so well-constructed that without a tennis ball or coin or some other everyday real object, you easily forget that everything your eye falls upon here is miniature.  For those who cannot get to Windsor Castle themselves to view the house in person, this book offers a very fine tour.	2002-03-14

After the brief ceremony, they are toasted as the paragons of fine breeding, good taste, and decorum. They then spend the rest of the evening getting drunk, smoking cigarettes, and giving new meaning to the term 'fine breeding.' \\"<br />The recipes work, mostly because they're simple. Some have great names--Nummies, for one (dried apricots filled with Boursin), or Our Family's Eggnog. For the most part, though, look at this less as an honest-to-goodness culinary venture and more as a time capsule of WASPhood in a time when WASPs are no longer commemorated, lauded, made fun of and displayed as they were in John Cheever's heyday.	2002-03-14

It's almost a fever dream of a novel.  The whole thing, as translated by John Nathan, has the mannered, stylized feel of an Art Deco print.  <br />This is not to take away from Mishima's tale.  He skillfully conveys the impressionism of a newly teenaged boy--the ease with which the boy, whose name is Noburu, believes first one thing, then another, and the vehemence with which he throws himself into his beliefs without first examining them dispassionately. Noburu's actions and reactions are an eerily prescient foreshadowing of the current religious militantism in the middle east and elsewhere--he is but one of millions of young, emotionally immature, inexperienced young people worldwide who chooses the simplicity of violence over the more difficult rewards of education and self-knowledge.<br />Though I had a feeling that the book would end the way it did, it was still something of a shock--and all the more so because Mishima chooses to stop his narrative just moments before Noburu and his gang commit their first adult atrocity.  The delicacy with which Mishima renders this tragic tale is astonishing and makes it easy to understand why this novel is a classic.	2002-03-09

Her short fiction, which has appeared regularly in THE NEW YORKER and elsewhere, is unbeatable.  Her humor is sharp, her descriptive powers awesome, and her stories (almost) always feel as though they actually go somewhere.<br />One of the best pieces in \\"Self-Help\\" is probably the first Lorrie Moore piece I ever read.  \\"Self-Help\\" was published the year I graduated from college, and I think a college friend gave me a copy of \\"How to Become a Writer.\\"  Note the \\"become\\" instead of \\"be.\\"  Moore acknowledges the process involved in writing and lets her readers know that writers are not sprung fully-formed from the head of Zeus or anyone else.  Listen to this beautifully assured, resonant, yet hilarious passage from \\"How to Become a Writer\\":<br />\\"First, try to be something, anything, else.  A movie star/astronaut.  A movie star/missionary.  A movie star/kindergarten teacher.  President of the World.  Fail miserably.  It is best if you fail at an early age--say, fourteen.  Early, critical disillusionment is necessary so that at fifteen you can write long haiku sequences about thwarted desire.  It is a pond, a cherry blossom, a wind brushing against sparrow wing leaving for mountain.  Count the syllables.  Show it to your mom.  She is tough and practical.  She has a son in Vietnam and a husband who may be having an affair.  She believes in wearing brown because it hides spots.  She'll look briefly at your writing, then back up at you with a face blank as a doughnut.  She'll say: 'How about emptying the dishwasher?'  Look away.  Shove the forks in the fork drawer.  Acccidentally break one of the freebie gas station glasses.  This is the required pain and suffering.  This is only for starters.\\"<br />Moore likes to do that--throw in references like Vietnam, then spin things around a little so that it comes out funny.  One of my favorite Lorrie Moore bits had to do with a woman who said something awful before she couldstop herself--Moore described the blurted insult as being \\"a lizard with a hat on.\\"  Wacko as that sounds, you still know exactly what she means.  That is her great gift--she makes life sound wacko and off-kilter, but you completely, utterly GET IT anyway.	2002-03-09

Before the bridge over the sound went in in the mid-20th century, Nags Head was a sleepy hamlet year-round with little to do other than swim and walk on the beach.  Though it's now a booming vacation town (a little too booming for some folks' tastes!), it maintains much of the flavor of its younger self and Rountree does a terrific job of capturing the elusive charm of the area.  <br />Nags Head, named after the old piratical practice of looping a lantern around the head of a nag to lure ships, is a thin slip of land on Bodie Island, off the eastern coast of North Carolina.  Its year-round population has grown to thousands, if not tens of thousands, but it used to be quiet all year-round.  The older families--the Midgetts, the Buchanans and others--have consistently come back generation after generation.  This constancy and devotion are among the things which makes Nags Head so historical and so tempting to vacation-goers today.  It's exciting to feel you're part of a continuum.  <br />Covering everything from the pirate activities of yore to the sundry big hurricanes and nor'easters to the historic Wright Brothers aviation experiments at nearby Kitty Hawk, Rountree provides a rounded, well-developed taste of the whole area.  She salts her narrative with wonderful old photographs and with first-person accounts of Nags Head stays.  One of her fine accomplishments in this area is the inclusion of black Nags Headers--usually the maids, cooks and so on for the white families which came to spend the summer.  One heartbreaking story has to do with a white Nags Head vacationer--an attractive young woman--who began to have trouble staying afloat in the ocean.  Her family sent out the strongest swimmer--a young black man who worked for them.  Unfortunately, the girl drowned anyway because the young man, justly afraid of being accused of improper behavior involving a white woman, tried to bring her to shore just holding her arm instead of looping his arm across her chest.  With this story alone, Rountree shows the prejudices of the time and the dangers lurking in this seemingly idyllic place.<br />Rountree also gives her full attention to the well-known Unpainted Aristocracy, which is a few dozen oceanfront homes which have stayed in the same families for many generations.  Self-taught architect and contractor S. J. Twine designed and built many of them and incorporated many ingenious design elements to help them withstand both the test of time and the year-round test of the weather and corrosive salt air.  Her alive and vital portrayal of Twine, with all his genius and his idiosyncratic behaviors, is alone worth the price of the book.  All in all, a job very, very well done.	2002-03-06

Kelley is especially apt in this day and age, when so much in life feels precarious and precious.  A simple and simply eloquent collection of photographs and quotations, it is so much more than the sum of its parts.  <br />The astronauts who have either landed on the moon or have orbited the earth have so much to tell us and it's easy to see from the photographs why they feel words fail them.  Luckily for us, words DON'T fail them.  This select, small group of men and woman try mightily to tell us what their experiences were, and overwhelmingly they succeed in conveying the mystery and beauty they saw from their unique perches in space.  A few of the better bits include:<br />\\"[From space] you have an almost dispassionate platform--remote, Olympian--and yet [seeing the earth from up there is] so moving that you can hardly believe how emotionally attached you are to those rough patterns shifting steadily below.\\"<BR>- THOMAS STAFFORD, USA<br />\\"O. Henry, the American writer, wrote in one of his stories that if you want to encourage the craft of murder, all you have to do is lock up two men for two months in an eighteen-by-twenty-four-foot room.  Entering 'Salyut,' which was to be both our home and our office for six months, we told each other: We are brothers.  I am you and you are me.\\"<BR>- VALERIE RYUMIN, USSR<br />\\"Before I flew, I was already aware of how small and vulnerable our planet is; but only when I saw it from space, in all its ineffable beauty and fragility, did I realize that humankind's most urgent task is to cherish and preserve it for future generations.\\"<BR>- SIGMUND JAHN, GERMANY<br />In no book that I can think of does the phrase \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\" better fit.  The photographs herein are astonishing in showing the exquisite planet we occupy.  A view of England's North Sea coast looks like a slab of lapiz lazuli, its surface flecked with sparkle and hue.  Canada's Lake Winnipeg from spacehas the appearance of something primal, almost fetal.  The Indian Ocean off Madagascar looks like a sheet of slate over which some divine presence has tossed a handful of diamonds.  So few of us can ever hope to share the experience of these men and women that this book is all the more precious, and beautiful.	2002-03-06

Did you know that the Gershwins and Irving Berlin composed more songs for Fred Astaire than for any other single person?  These men latched onto the carefree, wholly American ease projected by Astaire and made him the vehicle for some of their most memorable classics.<br />The quotations Giles gleans from Astaire friends, colleagues and family do the trick of supplementing the very little we know of this very private man.  Ginger Rogers tartly observes, \\"Well, I think when you work with somebody all day long, for ten movies, you become good friends, though he was as delighted not to see me at night over dinner as I was.\\"  Then here's Liza Minnelli asking Halston to dress her like \\"Fred Astaire in the daytime and a movie star at night.\\"  Cary Grant apparently felt that Astaire was the pinnacle of style--after watching \\"Broadway Melody of 1940,\\" Grant desparately searched everywhere for a white tuxedo identical to the one worn by Astaire in this film.  Even his podiatrist is quoted herein, noting wryly that Fred sometimes had trouble with his toes because he wore his shoes a half size too small so as to convey a neater impression.  <br />The photographs, many of which were published here for the first time, include studio glossies of Astaire with his many famous co-stars, Astaire at home with his family and dogs, and a hilarious shot of Astaire skateboarding in the late 1970s.  This examination of a one-of-a-kind talent is summed up most perfectly when Rudolf Nureyev says, \\"We were all dancing.  Fred was doing something else entirely.\\"  \\"Fred Astaire: His Friends Talk\\" is a must for any movie lover or dance lover's library.	2002-03-06

Collins seems to delight in making her as full-bodied, as attractive to men, and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire.  Given the tenor and social conventions of the time, her quest for revenge on the despicable Alan Armadale seems perfectly in keeping.  Lydia Gwilt is like an early, English Scarlett O'Hara without the redeeming humor Scarlett was known to exhibit.  All in all, an extraordinarily well-written and three-dimensional character study.	2002-03-05

It caused a storm of controversy when it was first published before the end of the 19th century.  With its frank (but not graphic) descriptions of sexuality and its emphasis on the fact that only the two people involved need to consent to a relationship--not their priest or minister, not their families, and certainly not society as a whole--\\"Jude\\" shocked the public.  It stands now as a beautifully sustained character study of a broken man and his steadfast love for the unsure Sue.  Jude is a rock and it is fitting that he makes his living carving stone.  Sue is birdlike, dainty, emotionally unstable and absolute catnip to Jude.  Beyond this, they are distantly related and that adds a certain fillip to their interactions.  The impatient reader will have difficulty understanding Jude's unwavering devotion, but it is evidence of Hardy's skill that he makes Jude make sense.	2002-03-05

He gathers together all the usual suspects: a wealthy family, an old house, a charming child, and the member of the house staff who harbors the secret in question.  While Collins falls short in his effort to sketch an unrequited yearning (I can't go into more detail if you haven't read the book), he does a beautiful job of portraying the subtle class differences and behaviors in this particular house.	2002-03-05

With \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" Sedaris strolls down something of an autobiographical lane.  The title story refers to his efforts to learn French in a language class in France (he has inconveniently neglected to learn French before having moved to France with his lover).  From his beginnings as a performance artist (one of his friends specialized in a performance piece that involved the artist being shot in the shoulder with a rifle), Sedaris moves on to moving (see the scathing summations of all the folks he's ever had the bad luck to move, including the woman who had not bothered to pack up a single item before the movers arrived) and other things.  Sometimes he takes a side trip, as when he goes home to visit his father and his sister Amy happens to be there as well.  Amy, who hasn't been home in some time, decides to wear a fat suit the entire weekend.  The effect of the fat suit on Mr. Sedaris is mind-bogglingly funny--he spends the entire weekend trying subtly to get her to eat less, to go out for a quick run--anything to get her to lose weight.  But the best thing by far has to be the classroom full of sundry nationalities, all trying in their crippled French to explain to a Moroccan student what Easter is:<br />\\"It would seem that despite having grown up in a Muslim country, she would have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no.  'I mean it,' she said.  'I have no idea what you people are talking about.'  The teacher called upon the rest of us to explain.  The Poles led the charge to the best of their ability.  'It is,' said one, 'a party for the little boy of God who call his self Jesus and . . . oh, s--t.'  She faltered and her fellow countryman came to her aid.  'He call his self Jesus and then he be die one day on two . . . morsels of . . . lumber.'  The rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pope an aneurysm.  'He die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father.' 'He weared of himself the long hair and after he die, the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples.' 'He nice, the Jesus.' 'He makes the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.'  Part of the problem had to do with vocabulary.  Simple nouns such as 'cross' and 'resurrection' were beyond our grasp, let alone such complicated reflexive phrases as 'to give of yourself your only begotten son.' \\"  Humor writing doesn't get any better than this.	2002-03-04

Given the strictures of Lamott's situation at the time--no man around to help her or take responsibility for his child--the humor in this book is nothing short of amazing.  After a particularly frustrating episode of feeding solids to her son Sam, Lamott writes that the process is a lot like spackling; you fill the hole with stuff, scrape around the sides, try to pack some more stuff in the hole, and so on.  This was so true and so perfectly described that I laughed out loud with recognition.  Although Lamott's situation isn't everyone's, the difficulties, fears and joys she describes herein are universal to most new parents.  This makes a marvelous gift for the new mom who has everything else and who could use a good laugh.	2002-03-03

Although I don't regret having read it, and it's beautifully written, I have to say that I found the ending to be most frustrating.  O'Brien seems to leave up to the reader exactly how the tension in the book is resolved and while that may work for some, it didn't work for me.  I like my loose ends neatly tied up, and that doesn't happen here.  Still, there is much to recommend it.  The reader has to work with this book--it is told from sundry points of view, all of which make the characters come vividly to life.  The flashbacks and oblique references to the main character's former interest in magic makes for fascinating subplot, and both greatly enhance our understanding of what makes him tick.  The main character's foray into plant care (I can't be more specific or I'll give something important away) inspires the same level of horrifically scary chill one gets reading in Stephen King's \\"The Shining\\" that the main character's novel consists of nothing other than the sentence, \\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\" over and over and over again.  I found the \\"interview\\" tidbits to be distracting, but they do enrich the novel with additional points of view.  Is it a love story?  A story of moral and political corruption?  A Vietnam cautionary tale?  It's all of these and more.	2002-03-03

In \\"Great Presidential Wit ( . . . I Wish I was in the Book),\\" Dole gathers together a wonderful, ragtag bunch of presidential anecdotes.  From the familiar (JFK saying that Washington, DC had \\"all the efficiency of the South and all the charm of the North\\") to the undiscovered gem (General William Tecumseh Sherman giving Ulysses S. Grant the uneasy compliment that, \\"Grant stood by me when I was crazy, and I stood by him when he was drunk, and now we stand by each other\\"), Dole has done a masterful job of pulling together numerous items on every single president.  My favorite story in the book refers to a man who was in the running for a cabinet position.  The president's friend (I won't tell you which president or which friend) urges him not to hire this bozo, calling the man dishonest.  \\"How bad is he?\\" inquires the president, to which the friend immediately replies, \\"Well, he wouldn't steal a red-hot stove . . . \\"  The cabinet nominee finds out about the insult and demands a retraction, prompting the president's friend to say, \\"Fine, you WOULD steal a red-hot stove!\\"  One of the most fun features of the book is Dole's categorization of each president into different roles.  Under \\"And You Always Thought They were Dull,\\" he lumps Ike, Jimmy Carter, and Rutherford B. Hayes.  Under \\"Yankee Wits,\\" just Calvin Coolidge and JFK share space.  Dole generously includes Bill Clinton under the heading of \\"Funnier Than the Average President\\" (along with John Adams, George Bush, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson).  This would make a terrific gift not only for your favorite politico, but for anyone who enjoys genuine good wit.	2002-03-03

Fact: Women who stay home with their kids are at a disadvantage financially and in terms of power.  Fact: Women who stay home with their kids are punished (or simply not given the same breaks) by a tax system which apparently assents to the existence only of paid workers.  Fact: This is a worldwide problem, with worldwide implications.  I could go on and on about this book, but the best recommendation I can give you is to READ IT IMMEDIATELY.  I have bought half a dozen copies of the book, in hard cover, because I felt so strongly about the value of what Crittenden has to say.

Emma Bovary is, in many ways, the French Scarlett O'Hara (rather, Scarlett O'Hara is the American Emma Bovary).  She wants what she wants, when she wants it, and damn anything that stands in her way.  As she assents to what will clearly be an unhappy marriage, we are given an extraordinarily detailed description of the wedding reception feast, but little of what was on her mind or in her heart.  Bovary employs this sort of technique to great effect to show that essentially, the wedding reception food was of more interest to Emma than was her husband, the guests, or the import of the vows she so freshly has taken.  The breathtaking ending shows that Emma has learned nothing.  As she goes to a rich man to beg on her own behalf, we see that she is envious of his dining room furniture as she enters the house--not that she is distraught at her personal situation.  \\"Madame Bovary\\" is absolutely required reading.	2002-03-03

Although jewelry is covered--as are crowns, religious reliquaries, carved gemstone figurines and more--the main thrust of this book is the nuts and bolts basics of gemstones.

Howell Raines is the new executive editor for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; but he is at heart a writer.  Both strengths come to the fore in this excellent book on the American civil rights movement.  As an oral history, it necessarily contains first-hand accounts of dozens and dozens of the main (and not-so-important) players in the movement.  Raines does a fine and fair job of putting their stories into essentially chronological order and editing or moving bits and pieces only where necessary to ensure good flow for the reader.  There were a few names I had heard of before, but many were new to me.  There are surprises in this book.  While we mostly associate the civil rights movement with the deep south in the mid-1960s, it actually got its start in Chicago in the 1940s when groups of people protested with the first lunch-counter sit-ins (when a manager came out to scold one of these groups with the flat, &quot;We don't serve colored folks here,&quot; one quick-witted participant fired back, &quot;That's OK, we don't eat 'em!&quot;).  Another revelation was the tensions between the older blacks and the younger black student generation.  The older blacks, while not happy with segregation, sometimes felt that at least everyone knew where they stood with it--while the younger generation was champing at the bit to get out there and change the world overnight.  Finally, it was interesting to read that many of the original founders of the movement were inspired far more by Gandhi than by Martin Luther King, Jr.  A number of them express their opinion that King--while undoubtedly important and absolutely essential once the movement got underway--was not himself so convinced as to the value of a) the movement itself and b) non-violent protest--many of this friends and co-workers say here that he continued to espouse it only because eventually, he felt he had been thoroughly and unmistakeably identified with it.  Although I was surprised that neither Coretta Scott Kingnor the Reverend Jesse Jackson were inteviewed for Mr. Raines' book, their absence is my only quibble with what is otherwise an enormously valuable and terrifically readable history.	2001-09-02

Nathaniel Philbrick's &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; begins--after some Nantucket and whale industry background--with the real-life &quot;Essex&quot; wreck and follows the crew through their several-months-long journey around the sea.  Working with remarkably little first-hand material--and practically no direct quotations--Philbrick somehow manages to raise up a living, breathing cast of characters who, through a horrific encounter with a seemingly enraged whale, find themselves literally adrift on the ocean with little direction, scant food and water, and fateful disagreement as to their overall plan.  Philbrick does an especially fine job sketching &quot;a day in the life&quot; of the typical Nantucketer, showing it to be a place where women could be proudly independent as their husbands and beaux went off to sea for years at a time and they stayed behind to manage hearth and home and most of the island's businesses.  That Nantucket began its American life as a proudly insular community which now depends on an influx of strangers (i. e., island vacationers) each year to maintain cash flow is but one of the many ironies evident in this superb book.	2001-09-02

Tony Bourdain's &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; handily accomplishes all these goals and more.  You'll never look at restaurant eating the same way again.  Worried about that little greasy spoon you hit for lunch every day?  Wait until you read about how things go even at the chi-chi, high-end New York City restaurants--in the kitchen, at the bar, when food is delivered, and so on.  Bourdain examines the type of personality drawn to restaurant work in every form--he looks not only at the executive chefs, but the prep cooks, the waiters, the hostesses, the owners (like the ones who want to own a restaurant just so they can display their good taste in furniture), the &quot;runners,&quot; the bartenders, and the delivery men.  His eye is acute and unerring and ruthless, most especially when he descibes his own foibles and quirks.  This is a superb read and a must-have for anyone who has waitressed, cooked, or otherwise worked in a restaurant even if they only lasted a day or two.	2001-09-02

He has written a horrifying tale, yet it is not a horror novel.  What elevates it above the level of the average paperback horror story is both the quality of the writing and calm, almost stately pace of the action.  Just 28 when he wrote &quot;La Moustache,&quot; Carrere writes with assurance and control.  The story is simple.  A man decides one day to shave off his mustache, then waits for people to comment on the difference in his appearance.  Not only do his friends and family not notice the change, but when he finally points it out to them, they deny that he ever wore a mustache at all.  The action spirals inexorably from this point.  The ending is masterful--both gut-level shocking and seemingly inevitable.  It's difficult to believe that this gem of a novel has not yet been made into a film, as the almost banal premise of the story finally precipitates extraordinary drama.  While both Hitchcock and Kafka leap to mind as influences, Carrere makes this psychologically frightening story all his own.	2001-07-19

Yet the stories resonate still because they are so gorgeously crafted that they rise above the details which might otherwise date them.  &quot;Goodbye My Brother&quot; stands, to my mind, as one of the finest examples of the American short story ever written.  In its pages you will find family, jealousy, adultery, childhood grievances spilling over into late adulthood arguments, drinking, ignorance of great privilege, bad behavior, card games, beach houses, and patrician resolve to ignore all indiscretion.  Though you will find the same elements in many other Cheever stories, his brilliance is in his ability to hew different stories by the dozen out of essentially the same basic ingredients.  Despite their similarities, his stories each stand on their own, little wonders of detail.  Each story is a different shake of the same kaleidoscope.  This collection is marvelous, and provides long-term satisfaction and wonderment at Cheever's talent.	2001-05-28

The reader has a relieved sense of &quot;That could have been me&quot; through much of &quot;Adrian Mole: The Cappucino Years.&quot;  Adrian has grown into a 30-year old man who is divorced and has a humiliating job as a chef and host of a cooking show by the hilarious title of &quot;Offally Good!&quot;  He doesn't understand (or particularly want to understand) his young son William, and he remains appalled at his bad fortune to be born into a family he considers to be beneath him.  Adrian is, full on and fully realized, the person any of us could be if we'd stubbornly refused to learn from any of our mistakes.	2001-05-28
