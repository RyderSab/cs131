I've never laughed so much from reading a Stephanie <br />Plum book before. Kudos to Janet Evanovich for 10 Big Ones. These <br />books just seem to get better and better with each increasing number. <br /> <br />          SP returns with all of her familiar characters. And this time there's a contract out, on her life. She takes refuge  <br />in the 'Bat Cave'. <br /> <br />                       This book kept me involved to the very <br />last page. Keep up the good work, Janet:)	2005-07-30

I think this book read more like a fairy tale, and I've yet to experiment with any of the recipes. <br /> <br />         Tita loves Pedro,but because she's the youngest daughter, tradition has other plans for her. Pedro marries her <br />older sister instead just to be closer to Tita, but things don't work out as they'd like. <br /> <br />           This book reminded me very much of Cinderella(the fairy tale). This was a good story, but it could have been much <br />better. For that reason, this reviewer gives Like Water for Chocolate 3.5 stars.	2005-02-20

Gap Creek is the 14th Oprah book I've read so far. I <br />enjoyed this book of a couple's first year of a marriage. The reason it didn't get five stars was because of the writing. I know that the main character was supposed to be shown as a hillbilly, but writing like this gets on my nerves. And I fear <br />that I'll lose my knowledge of proper English. <br /> <br />               Julie moves away from her mother and three sisters to begin a life with her husband. This book is plagued by misery, but if you can withstand that, you'll find this book a good read. <br /> <br />             This reviewer gives Gap Creek by Robert Morgan  <br />4 stars:)  <br />	2005-02-12

Also there's <br />an elderly woman who loves to shoot guns. <br /> <br />           I truly don't mind deja vu when it comes to Janet Evanovich, because her books are wonderful, very adventurous, but each one is very different.

I was hoping this book would be worth 5 stars,but then I read it. I was disappointed. I have so many questions. <br />Maybe they were there, and I overlooked them. Like, what state  <br />was Blessings in? How old was Skip? Who was Lydia's former husband?The sentences often confused me <br />          <br />         It seemed like two stories going at once. The baby in the box, and a woman and her memories. It seemed very unrealitic that he would take her without telling anyone about it. I would have liked to see him give Lydia more of a role in the baby's upbringing. He was made to look very stingy. How did he think he could live a full life with that much of a responsibility.  <br /> <br />             Because of a decent ending, I give this book three <br />stars. <br />	2004-12-01

Coffin Dancer by Jeffrey Deaver is a thriller that I found absolutely wonderful. <br /> <br />          This is the second in the Lincoln Rhyme mystery series <br />that I've read, the first being The Bone Collecter. I found it <br />every bit as exciting as TBC. The book did have a tremendous  <br />amount of police lingo, but I had no problems in looking the <br />definitions up. <br /> <br />            The main character is a quadriplegic and former <br />cop. The setting this time is an airport. The identity of the <br />killer was a complete surprise to me. Lincoln has 2 women <br />vying for his attention this time. <br /> <br />               I give The Coffin Dancer 5 stars, and I can't wait to read 'The Empty Grave'.

The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was a great book that I'd recommend<br /><br />to anyone. I love books about kids, and the 9-year-old main character in this book was a real spunky girl who reminded  me a<br /><br />lot of myself at that age.<br /><br />  It all starts when a divorced woman takes her 2 kids<br /><br />on a hike in the Appalachian trail. The son and mother argue the<br /><br />whole time. When the girl gets tired of the fighting, she goes off by herself, and accidentally gets lost.<br /><br />  With what little she carries in her backpack, including, an egg, a tuna sandwich,a bottle of surge, a bottle of<br /><br />water,celery sticks, 2 twinkies, and a walkman she struggles to manage alone in the woods for several days. When she is found she is in a different state. Her love of baseball helped her to get through this.<br /><br />  I wish King wrote more books like this. I prefer<br /><br />it to the fantasy I find in his other books. This reviewer gives<br /><br />this book a high score of 5 stars:)	2004-10-01

His daily routine is more than any one person should be able to bear. Lincoln realives<br /><br />this, and has plans.<br /><br />  When a serial killer appears in town, officers come to him for help. Mystery and suspense fill this book. I didn't want to put it down. I felt a real bond with this<br /><br />character, perhaps because I'm a paraplegic.<br /><br />  But anyway I can't wait to read the next book in<br /><br />the series,Coffin Dancer, and I give The Bone Collector five<br /><br />stars and recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller.	2004-09-18

I liked it, and it was very worthwhile for me to read;it just wasn't one of my favorites. <br /> <br />      Five sisters are born to a teacher and his wife. According <br />to the neighborhood boys, this is a very strict and over <br />protective family, in that the parents don't let the girls date <br />or go out of the house. This family becomes a spectacle for the <br />neighborhood boys whereas they constantly peek through the windows and observe this family's daily existence. The girls have no friends.

I'm just jealous that I didn't come up with this idea and write this book. <br /> <br />         Trevor is a 12 year old 'good' boy who lives with his  <br />mother. His Jr.High School social studies class has an assignment for extra credit to change the world, for the better, in some way. That's when Trevor gets the excellent idea to start innumerable pyramids of doing good deeds. <br /> <br />        Trevor's teacher is one the three people that he wants to do a good deed for. Disfigured in the Viet Nam war,  <br />Mr.St.Clair is single too, and I don't think I need to explain where this is leading to. <br /> <br />       When one person dies and another ends up in jail, the  <br />poor boy thinks his project was a complete failure. Little does <br />he know that his idea is about to go worldwide. <br /> <br /> <br />This was definitely the best book I've ever read. I recommend everyone to read it. I wish I could give it 10 stars. Do yourself a favor and read this book:) <br /> <br />	2004-08-06

Wally Lamb is a magnificent writer, and the fact that this was written from a woman's point of view, just makes it all the more better. <br />   She's Come Undone is the second book I've read by this author, I Know This Much Is True being the first. His books seem to me to be so touching and realistic.<br />   This is the story of a young girl in search of happiness. The relationship between her parents is terrible,she was raped, she's extremely overweight, she has no boyfriend, and later she desperately wants a baby. All these things make her very unhappy and depressed. If only she could change a few things she knew she'd be happy.<br />   When it happens that she's no longer overweight, and has the boyfriend she always wanted, she finds that she still has no<BR> happiness. As the book proceeds, and at the end, she discovers<BR>that the happiness she was searching for, all along, was there<BR>all the the time. You just have to know where to look.<br />        I loved this book, and I'm sure it won't be the last time I read it. Since I can give it no more, I'll give it 5 stars:)	2004-06-26

I have to admit this was a wonderful read, but it could<BR>have been better.I'm thinking that maybe if she hadn't made the<BR>book so long, she could have kept the important storylines and kept the reader involved.<br />        This book includes everything:mystery, love, romance, thieves, kids, animals. But in my opinion it tries to tell too many stories at once.

In my opinion, there is no question about this. I feel the parent should stay with the children, especially while the children are young. It not only benefits the child, but also the adult.<br />          I had a difficult time getting through this book,<BR>mainly because the sentences were jammed too full, trying to prove that this woman was too busy.

Of course, the kids drew me to this book, but there<BR>really wasn't enough of the kids  to satisfy me.<br />           The story never really got me involved. It's like the author tried to cram too much into each sentence to exhaust the reader, and prove that the main character was too busy. It is my personal belief that women should stay with their kids. It not only benefits the kids, but also the parents. It's just too bad that practically the whole book went by before she realized this. <br />           I would have rather read about a stay at home mom <BR>who struggled, but took great care of her children. This is the first book I have read by this author, and now I'll be scared to read others by her. I rated I Don't Know How She Does It a 2.5 stars:)	2004-06-03

It reminded me<BR>very much of the movie A Wonderful Life with Jimmie Stewart.<br />The first book I've read by this author, now I'll have to read<BR>&quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;:)<br />All the books I've been reading strike a chord with me, but this<BR>one, I felt that I could have been the main character. I felt<BR>such a close relationship to the subject matter.<br />Eddie is a carnival repairman, and the story begins with his <BR>death. He feels his life was nothing, but he meets five very surprising people who show him otherwise. Some of these people he didn't even know existed.<br />This was a very quick read, and one that I'd recommend to everyone. This reviewer rates it a five, because it's as good as<BR>it gets:)	2004-04-12

Romance novels are the same in that the woman is too<BR>stubborn to realize what she needs, and then something happens, and POOF!!! everyone lives happily ever after.<br />       ~But as it goes this is a wonderful story and includes both of my favorite things; a child and a dog.<BR>            <BR>       Maggie returns home from a bad marriage with her 5yo son for a short stay. When she meets Dallas Fortune, she tries to resist him and the Fortune name. Eventually they begin a relationship.<br />       As far as romance novels go, this is a good one:)	2004-03-26

This is the first of the Fortune books I've read, so it was pretty confusing with the other stories going on. And I had to<BR>continously look back at the family tree to see what relation <BR>each person had to the main characters of the book.<BR>           <br />All in all, I enjoyed this book even though romances are all the same; the woman is too stubborn to realize her true feelings. Then something happens to make her change her views.<br />In this book, Dallas Fortune is the son of a wealthy family and Maggie is the daughter of the Fortune's housekeeper. After her<BR>husband leaves her Maggie returns home with her [young] son.<BR>Maggie and Dallas fall in love, and after a 'rollercoaster ride'<BR>they form a relationship<br />I enjoyed this book and I'd recommend it:)	2004-03-22

This is a real page turner that I just couldn't put down, and one of the best books I've ever read.<br />                         Four close friends attending Dartmouth<BR>University are the main characters of the story. They play and work together. They're together constantly.

This was a quick read for me, and the second book I've read by <BR>Rosamunde Pilcher,the other being Shell Seekers. I love her <BR>writing style. She's included the perfect things for me to truly<BR>enjoy a book: kids and animals.<br />It all starts when Virginia takes a trip with her mother. She meets a man and falls in love. Before anything can become of this, her mother drags her away. <br />She eventually marries and has two children: Cara and Nicholas.<BR>When her husband dies, she returns to Porthkerris where she'd<BR>met her first love.<br />The rest is just too delicious, and in my opinion, <BR>Rosamunde Pilcher is one of the best writers, and we're lucky to<BR>have her:)	2004-03-08

This is the first Anne of Green Gables book I've read, but I have seen the earler versions on tv. I guess I cheated by jumping right to Anne of Ingleside,but I was anxious to see how she fared with five kids, six actually, because she's pregnant when the story opens.<br /><br />  I  read it and all I can say is what a sweet<br />adolescent book:) This story takes us on an adventure of Anne<br />and her family. Mostly each chapter is devoted to a single family member's adventure. With three girls and three boys, there are many adventures, like the time  when an aunt came and wouldn't leave,or the lesson about false friends.<br /><br />  This was a fun book to read and I definitely<br />give it my highest rating:)	2004-03-05

For me, the pages just seemed to turn by themselves.<BR>         The main character who remains nameless goes on an<BR>excursion, with a married couple and another male friend, to find<BR>her father. They stay in his cabin, where memories haunt the main character, and adventures follow them, one after another.<BR>         If you've never been camping, this is the book to read.<BR>It'll take you there!!!	2004-02-29
