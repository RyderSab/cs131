I have considered the Bad Boys books to be one of the best guilty pleasure ever invented - hot, sexy stories about men who are wonderful, especially when they're being bad... <br /> <br />But this anthology might as well have been published by a different house - or in a different universe. These stories all lacked spark, sizzle and depth. Rosemary Laurey's story was especially awful - I think I counted over 100 exclamation points before it was over (my brain was so tired! from all! the excitement!).  <br /> <br />If it wasn't for the subject matter and the occasional \\"dirty\\" word, I would have thought this a collection for children - simplistic and overly melodramatic. Compared to the smary, sassy contributors to the other Bad Boys collections, these stories lacked not only something, but EVERYTHING. I'm just glad I waited to borrow it from the library.  <br />	2005-02-18

Simply put, the stories in this anthology were amusing if a little staid, not living up to the zing or power of some of the more hip collections (How to be a Wicked Woman, etc.)<br /><br />The one exception to this rule was the story by L.A. Banks. That one was awful. Absolutely awful. Too much description, not enough conversation, a hero who's saving the world by playing his guitar (huh?) and an ending that was not only dissapointing, but down right absurd. I will certainly not be searching out any other stories by this author, and will avoid any anthologies she's included in.	2005-01-25

There's no denying that everything Nora Roberts writes qualifies as \\"a good read.\\" But when an author's been writing for so long and has completed so many works, you start to expect something more. <br /> <br />Especially when the latest novel is over 500 pages long. <br /> <br />I didn't feel like we got anything more with this book. Roberts seems to have moved away from the purple prose and over-inflated emotions of her earlier works, but in this novel she didn't replace them with anything. I'm all for snappy dialogue and fast-paced romance, but when the characters have spent a small amount of routine time together, I just don't believe they're in love. It felt like Roberts knows we know what's supposed to happen and didn't bother to tell the entire story. <br /> <br />Also, the language she writes in leaves a lot to be desired. I could think of many more poetic and touching ways to describe the beauty of Alaska, the interraction of small-town characters, the blossoming love between Nate and Meg, etc. It felt like this book was written to a third grade reading level, and left me feeling a little detatched from the scene.  <br /> <br />And I agree with another reviewer who said there seemed to be more scenes involving supporting characters than there were with our main couple. I tried to map the story's progress in my head, and ended up with a mish-mosh of little scenes that somehow muddled us through a murder investigation - one which seemed painfully obvious to me from the very beginning, and so unlike the twists and turns of an Eve Dallas mystery that I felt somewhat cheated.  <br /> <br />I'll continue reading Roberts books, but I'm hoping she'll apply herself more in future projects. <br />	2004-10-19

After stumbling onto Kauffman in one of the Bay Boy anthologies, I was really interested in reading the next installment in her Morgan family saga.<br />I'm finished with the book, and wondering why the story never actually began.<br />This novel is nothing more than 300 pages of character ruminations - this is what I've been through, this is what I think she's up to, this is why this relationship is different from all the others, this is what I think I should do with my life... and so forth. I kept waiting for the action to start. I kept waiting for the plot to heat up. They meet, they have steamy sex, they have some kind of cosmic connection... and they stay together forever. No hang up, no glitch in the works, no nothing. There aren't even any crazy townspeople or wacky sheep (which the back of the book promised) to liven things up. Nothing.<br />I gave the book two stars instead of one because I felt she created some really wonderful characters. She just never took them anywhere. I thought this would be an engaging read and it turned into an exercise in speed reading. Skip it for sure.	2004-07-10

I love Suzanne Enoch's books - they're always entertaining and often laught-out-loud funny. But this one was different.<br />It wasn't good.

And if I was in love with someone as head-strong and stupid as Joy, I'd run as fast as I could in the other direction. I't one thing when the heroine insists to be her own &quot;alpha-female,&quot; and another when she acts like a fool.

Where the few weeks following the rape were described in excruciating detail, the time after (especially Teena's) is glossed over. You wonder if she ever knew what Droomoore did for her, and if not, how she coped.<br />All in all a worthwhile read, and one that will stay with you for a long time after.	2004-02-24

But her latest book has me worrying about the deterioration of her talent... or what the publishers consider fit to put into hardcover. <br />Was this a book written for adults? JAK's sentence structure, while never complex, borders on simplistic in this book. With lines like \\"Daria looked very happy\\" and \\"he could feel the positive energy of happiness in the air\\" I was beginning to wonder if she'd decided to write a novel for twelve year olds and then threw in a few less-than-spicy sex scenes to please the romance fans. She's also developed this annoying habit of bringing the reader up to date on things that happened only a few pages ago, filling in the gaps of her characters thought patters as if a rational adult couldn't think the situation through.<br />The plot is boring, with too many strains to follow and not enough emotion to make me care whether Zoe and Ethan stay together - in fact, the only hint of excitement in the story was the bit concerning Arcadia's supposedly dead husband, and that was over so quickly you had to wonder why she put it in at all. This novel didn't seem to have a point, save that the preceding book was rather good, and she felt it needed a sequel. But this isn't a sequel. It's an afterward, at best.<br />Add one star, I guess, if you can get this from the library and not shell out the money for a hard cover. I feel like I've been burned and certainly won't be paying for any of JAK's future efforts.	2004-01-08

I'm not sure why, but this last installment of Quinn's Bridergton series left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I've waited for this book for a year, read the rest of the series over again in preparation, and then finished this book in one afternoon... feeling as if I'd read a short-story that didn't live up to the standards of the rest of her books.<BR>Julia Quinn is something of a hero to me because she manages to liven-up a genere of romance (regency) that is so often over-written and under-developed. Her characters are wonderful, not only because they fall in love so beautifully, but because they interact with their families, they have issues they need to resolve (Simon's fear of being a father, Anthony's fear of death, Colin's fear of a wasted life, etc.) and the love they find helps them grow and accomplish that. They also make the reader laugh, and seem so real that you have to love them.<br />But Phillip and Eloise seem to sail through their story, never quite getting into the real issues facing their relationship. It happens too quickly, and their distance from the rest of the Bridgerton clan takes away some of the charm of the tale (most especially the absence of Penelope, Eloise's best friend and Colin's wife, who on the day of Eloise's dissapearance revealed a great secret that Eloise never learns and really should).<br />All in all, by the standards of the genre, it is a fun, easy and engaging story that will make you want to read all the other Bridgerton books. But by Quinn's standards, well, I'm just waiting for the next one.	2003-08-06

It was a week ago today that I finished reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix; it has taken that long for me to organize my thoughts and decide on a review. Throughout that time I have alternated between praising the style of Rawling's writing and denouncing her pitiful plot structure. But one thing has bothered me behind it all, and after a week of reflection I know what it is...<br />Above and beyond the fantastical storytelling and breathtaking adventure the Harry Potter books offer, we must remember that they are in fact children's books (though I would argue that this last volume is not suitable for ANYONE under the age of 13). Children's books, while they entertain and broaden the vocabulary and skill of young readers, also teach lessons and display examples of human behavior that children then learn to emulate or disregard. Children learn through the struggles and triumphs of others how to deal with difficulties and challenges in their own lives. And here, then, is the problem: I would not want children taking ANY lessons away from this book.<br />The first disturbing element of the book is the distant and almost negletory maner in which Harry is treated by his so called allies and friends. He is kept in the dark, pushed along, and is treated neither like a child (who is cared for) nor an adult (who is respected) but as a non-entity who must simply exist until his turn in the game comes up. He goes to Hogwarts and must deal with the wary stares and accusations of a population who has been told he is a loon, and those few people who believe him (with the exception of Hermione and Ron, his only true allies throughout this story) tell him to sit down, shut up and behave himself. If things had been explained to Harry in the beginning (rather than on page 825, after all the trouble has occured), he might have obeyed without so many conflicting emotions. Readers wonder why Harry spent the book whining and brooding - wouldn't you? He is pushed from sceneto scene, restriced from asking questions about a situation at which he is the very center.<br />Because of this neglect I feel the greatest \\"miss-lesson\\" in this novel is taught - namely, how to deal with a lunatic like Professor Umbridge. She is painted in this novel as someone worse even than Voldemort - an adult who is filled with only malice and evil, but is permitted to hurt those around her (ESPECIALLY the children, ESPECIALLY Harry) because there is no one who can and will stop her. When Harry is subjected to her cruel and painful idea of detention, having the words \\"I must not tell lies\\" gouged into the back of his hand repeatedly for over a week, what does he do? What can he do? He has, in effect, told the truth, the most profound and important truth that Voldemort has returned, but because of political and social ramifications which have not been explained to him, he is being punished cruelly, I would go so far as to say abused. And he tells no one, because he feels he must be a man and deal with this on his own. The absence and preoccupation of his elder allies (especially Dumbledore, the biggest idiot of them all) causes him to ACCEPT THIS ABUSE IN SILENCE, rather than expose the horrid treatment he should not be enduring... I don't think I have to explain any further why this is a lesson our children should NOT be learning...<br />It is with definite regret that I say these things about Rawlings' latest work, having been a great fan of her first three novels, and the lessons of love, strength, truimph and endurance she taught therein. But this book is not only different, it is painful and misleading for children, and what they take away from the reading experience is a million times more important that what an adult ever would.	2003-07-05

Of course, it always helps when there's an interesting story surrounding the romance, just to keep intelligent readers interested.<br />I've already become enamoured with JD Robb's \\"In Death\\" series, and wondered if there were any other on-going tales like those, where the hero and heroine not only love each other, but work together and prove through action and not simple rhetoric that they love, trust and respect one another.<br />It seems that Slightly Shady may be what I was looking for. Though not as darkly dramatic as Robb's novels, Quick's new series seems to promise some light-hearted tales full of mystery, murder, passion and witty reparte. <br />I'm looking forward to the next installment, hoping for some further character development and the growth of their relationship.

Mr. Burt has put together a wonderful list of the most influential authors in Western (and a few Eastern) literature. It is a great companion to any literary enthusiast's library; conversly it would also be an excellent guide for someone who is looking to broaden their literary horizons, and not waste any time on overly-obscure or difficult to decipher texts. Don't get me wrong, not everything on this list is easy (If you can get through Joyce's Ulysses you are a better man than I), but each text is well known enough that a wealth of criticism or in many cases reading companions can be found for them. <br />My only gripe is the exclusion of Dr. Samuel Johnson from the list. The man wrote the first English Dictionary - what's more influental that that? But the fact that you can argue with Burt's lineup while at the same time seeing the sense of his choices - that's what makes for an excellent piece of work.	2003-04-24

I find Thomas Pynchon to be the single-most disturbing American author to date - both for his brilliance and his incomprehensibility. So when the venerated author reccomends a book, I tend to think there's something special between the covers... but this time I was wrong.<br />Either that, or I definitely missed something.<br />The quirkiness of the story was promising, but the plot lagged (after 100 pages I wasn't sure if the real story had started yet) and the writing style, while at times comical and quick, was over all not impressive. Worst of all, however, was the ending of the tale, coming abruptly and much too early. About twenty pages after the story finally gets going it's over - and without resolving anything. This, of course, is a typical function within the contemporary \\"smart\\" novel, but the rest of this book did not warrant that lable. <br />If this story was supposed to be about the main character's dissolving into madness, it remained way too shallow and colloquial for that effect. If, however, it was supposed to be about his uncovering a bizzare, unthinkable conspiracy that normally he would never think to be true... well, it was a good start, but didn't come anywhere near to being finished.	2003-03-31

While her canning, preserving and cooking processes took up pages of the story, her friendship with Patsy and Janice simply materialized, despite their strange behavior and Lillian's need for secrecy. Her relationship with Matt is also steamrolled - what could have been a beautiful love story became the background for bits and pieces of a story about food, sleuthing and abuses of all kinds - and no theme was played out completely. <br />Even the resolution to Jimmie's life of mystery is given in the last few pages, laid out plainly and quickly as if Deveraux's deadline was upon her and she needed to wrap it up. We didn't even get to see Matt propose!<br />All of this rushing results in a story that could have been so much more, from an author whose work has been more, and hopefully will be again.	2002-07-23

Linda Lael Miller writes romance in a way that is sometimes so necessary - the people are wonderful, their lives (though hard) are wonderful, and their romances are so full of love and purpose that you imagine their world crumbling without the perfection of it.<br />And I love every minute of it.<br />Though slightly less sophisticated than her Primrose Creek series, the Springwater novels are to me a happy little world that's pleasant and loving and - with the modern day continuation of A Springwater Wedding - heartwarming in its continuity.	2002-06-06

The beginning of this series was wonderful, but by page 20 of this novel, I felt the story was already over, and more importantly, the romance was gone. For the first time I was more interested in the marriages that had already taken place than in the current romantic focus. How droll!<br />I thought the theory that Mia's fate was to reject Sam and except that separation was interesting... and reinforced so thoroughly by her AWFUL and shallow behavior, that by the end I'd hoped it was true. Her stubbord independence, normally charming in Roberts' romantic females, was so absolute and unyeilding that by the end of the novel I wished she'd jump off the cliff and save all of her friends a lifetime of watching after her and struggling to understand her &quot;mystic&quot; ways. <br />And as for the Wiccan influences... it was an interesting premise in the first two novels and, having once practiced, I thought fairly reverent and honest. The magick in this book, however, was so grand and so precocious, I felt at times that I might as well be reading Harry Potter - and at least they had learned spells to recite and not just quippy little rhymes that they just HAPPENED to come up with at a moment's notice!<br />I am still a big Roberts fan and would tell any would be reader to skip this series in favor of any of her Irish novels, especially her Born in Fire, Born in Ice, Born in Shame series. It's in those straight forward romances that Roberts shows some true magic - not in the hocus pocus of this deflated story.	2002-06-06

The other two books in that series, &quot;Dream Stone&quot; and &quot;Prince of Time&quot; were equally as impressive, well thought-out and executed.<br />So I had high expectations for &quot;River of Eden,&quot; but should have known when I saw it published only in paperback that I was in for an entirely different experience. This was a decent story, exciting and with a little steamy romance, but not at all the emotional and dreamy fiction created in the former series.<br />&quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot; left an impression on me, and changed the face of the romance genre a bit. This novel contained none of that power.	2002-04-03

Le Guin is the undeniable master, and this is the only science fiction novel I can honestly say I've reccomended to everyone I know. This is was literature should be - about people, regardless of race or planetary orientation.<br />Definitely one of the best novels I have ever read, in any genre.	2001-06-18

It may sound crazy, but I first read the Earthsea trilogy when I was in  sixth grade. I have read all four of the Earthsea books at least once a  year since then and, when people ask me what got me interested in  literature, so interested that I'm now studying for my PhD, I tell them it  was this book. Enough said.	2000-08-08

This novel seems to me not at all a suspense thriller or even a tale of  the supernatural, but rather a commentary on the difficulties, hang-ups and  rediculous situations inherent in writing (or filming) a scholarly work.   And for someone who has written quite a few papers... well, I laughed out  loud at some of Zampano's conventions (especially the footnotes - how many  of us have made up a few to identify some imaginary research of our own??).   I was impressed beyond belief by this novel, and give Danielewski an  enormous amount of credit for making a statement like this in his first  novel. God help him when it comes to writing the second...	2000-08-07

My friends and I have been addicted to Garwood's books since high school,  and considering the frequency with which she publishes them (that is at a  snail's pace compared to some other romance novelists) I was incredibly  excited to read this new story... and rather dissapointed when it was over.   This is not the witty, organized, insightful Garwood of old.  Where was  the developing romance?  Where was the humor?  Where was the, well,  interesting, imaginitive and compelling story?  This book did nothing but  frustrate me and I felt that the ending did in fact conflict with some of  the information she leaked about the &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; earlier on in  the book.  All in all, not her best effort by far. And P.S. - when someone  checks something on the internet (such as a page that teaches you how to  make bombs, as her psychopathic killer does), it is called a web  &quot;site&quot; NOT &quot;sight&quot; as was written in the novel.  Sorry...	2000-08-07
US	52783750	R2VGB89AKDMFON	0385334370	703888182	Handyman	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Could have been much more...	I find myself largely in agreement with Laurie Shallah, who made some very  valid points about the worthiness of our hero vs. our heroine.  I thought  both characters were likeable enough, but there were way too many holes in  the book's plot to even make the story engaging, and I was so annoyed by  the supposedly &quot;unforgetable&quot; secondary characters (the book  jacket says something like that), that I found myself skipping much of the  middle of the book just to get to the resolution of their  misunderstanding... which was covered all too quickly.  Two and a half  pages and he's forgiven, they're married and she accepts his overly  obsessive gesture of building her dream house behind her back?  It should  have been the focal-point of the story... the misunderstanding about his  identity would have been much better solved earlier on in the book,  Maggie's anger played out, and then the two characters forced to learn to  like each other for who they REALLY are. All in all I think Mrs. Nichols  has talent (especially with dialogue, when you can find it), but she would  much better serve her readers with a story that focuses more on the point  (their love, i'm presuming) and less on the cliche things that are supposed  to keep them apart until the required 300 pages have been filled.	2000-08-07
