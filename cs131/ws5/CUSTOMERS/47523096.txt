The period of history we are talking about, though is the 1 million-year history of humans on planet Earth. Yes. the entire history of our species. In one book. Yes.<br /><br />Diamond's forte is laying out the broad patterns of human history. Starting with the appearance of humans in Africa a million years ago, he follows human expansion in Asia and Europe and the Americas. He describes the waves of extinction of large mammals coincident with (and he claims due to) the spread of humans into new areas. Diamond's view is macroscopic: on great movements of peoples, great developments of political sophistication, great tides of colonizations, great swaths of disease and technological advance. What emerges is an understanding of the patterns of history that is so profound, so commonsensical, that it is just scary. Diamond amazes by broadening his grasp of world-wide trends - focusing not only on Europe's recent history, but the on Middle East, Indonesia, Oceania, Australian and the Americas.<br /><br />The sub-theme of the book, the point that Diamond hammers home again and again is this: people are the same the world over; each group of humans being as smart, resourceful and vicious as any other. The differences of culture and technology and military outcomes are often (and I mean often!) due at their base to accidental geographical factors that provided some groups with enormous head starts (often in the many thousands of years) over other groups.<br /><br />Diamond presents evidence from archeology, genetics, linguistics, paleo-biology, botany and many other sciences  -- as well as his personal study of the people of New Guinea -- to make his points. His conclusions are strongly supportive of geographical determinism. Certain geographical configurations - such as the long East-West axis of Eurasia - are conducive to the spread of peoples, culture and technology. Being at similar same latitudes, Eurasians had an advantage when moving to other locales within the continent: similar climates allowed them to transplant crops developed in one location to others. Contract this with the Americas, where a crop, like maize, domesticated in South America's temperate zone could not survive in the Central American jungles, and so could not spread easily to North America.<br /><br />Diamond devotes separate chapters to the rise of domesticate crops and domesticated animals, describes clearly concisely why some crops and animals are easily domesticable while others are not. He shows that practically every domesticable crop on the planet was domesticated in pre-history, demonstrating convincingly that poorer continents were not so by dint of their dim-witted or incurious inhabitants. He then ably demonstrates the rather disturbing fact of the lopsided distribution of domesticable plants and livestock over the planet. Eurasia, by happenstance, was blessed with most of the domesticable plants and animals, far more than the Americas (where early peoples likely wiped out all large mammals) and far, far more than Australia. Africa, with its overabundance of large mammals, is nevertheless impoverished in terms of native *domesticable* animals, a fact that left that continent far behind in its ability to produce food via means other than human muscle power.<br /><br />Diamond's chapters on the development of writing are fascinating, as are his description of the way complex political systems were developed to handle the ever-larger human populations sustainable by ever-increasing food supplies. Diamond's view is that all political systems are to one degree or another kleptocracies, giving back to its members and giving only part of what it takes from them. And forthrightly describes the role that organized religions use to legitimize rulers and their practices.<br /><br />Diamond takes dead aim at the supposed superiority of European culture as the main cause of Europe's success at subjugating the Americas. But this is no bleeding heart apologia on behalf of native Americans. Diamond describes in horrifying detail how European germs (bred in cities which were the perfect breeding ground for successive plagues of such nasty bugs) rendered the conquerors so terrible. Regardless of the intentions of the invaders, Diamond claims, 95% of the 20 million natives of the America would have succumbed to diseases like smallpox, typhus and measles. By the time Hernando De Soto explored the Mississippi in 1540, the vast Indian empires of central North America had been completely depopulated by disease. It was disease and that unknown weapon of war, the horse, that allowed Fransisco Pizzaro to rout 80,000 Inca warriors using only 168 horsemen and soldiers. The Conquest was not, as Pizzaro liked to think, due to the superiority of the Spanish, or of God's will.<br /><br />As a religious person, this last fact is difficult to deal with. One may choose to see God's will in the endless exterminations, plagues and uneven distribution of food and animal stocks that drove much of human movement for the last million years. However, I personally find this view hard to stomach. How can God be considered \\"provident\\" when he provides so differently to people in different parts of his Creation? Diamond's description of religions as legitimizing political kleptocracies was not a welcome message, but one that certainly resonated. It is not only in Islamic countries that religion and politics mingle in unseemly union.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is an important contribution of the understanding of our collective human history. Imbued with equivalent intelligence and abilities, the lives of all human being are nevertheless determined to a large degree by our environment. *Where* we are born matters more than *to whom* we are born.<br /><br />A note about the cassette edition (which is no longer available for purchase): Doug Ordunio did a terrific job (over the course of 11 cassettes!) of rendering Diamond's tight and straightforward prose into a pleasant and informative listening experience.t the supposed superiority of European culture as the main cause of Europe's success at subjugating the Americas.

US	47523096	RMADFQFT1TQI6	1563051826	384687998	002: Citizen Lazlo!: The Lazlo Letters, Volume 2	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Tepid collection of juvenile pranks	Lazlo Toth - Nixon-loving, airline-food-hating, Imelda-lusting, Russian-Federation-anthem-writing local nut and obsessive complainer - is back for another go at the politicians and corporations, Having talked up the first Lazlo book to my sons, I was anxious to share Don Novello's delightful humor with them. So I picked up the Volume 2 and opened it and random and read aloud the first couple of letters I came upon. They landed with a thud. Went over like a lead balloon. Or a fart in a funeral parlor.<br /><br />Like the original, this volume consists of a series of chatty, off-kilter letters to famous people and organizations, with the purpose of soliciting unintentionally comical responses. To work, the letters must skate the fine edge between plausibility and absurdity. Sadly, Novello misses the edge nearly every time. Neither does he give an interesting or consistent personality to his fictitious writer, Lazlo Toth. Or appear to have any purpose other than to ridicule his targets. He doesn't reach for satire, or for social commentary beyond the rather pedantic realization that many famous public figures respond to most mail with stuffy form letters.<br /><br />Maybe I'm getting old. More likely, Novello lost the ability to summon up the anarchic fun that made his first book so funny. Not to mention, some of his targets are onto him! When you get knowing responses from George H.W. Bush's secretary and from (yikes!) Ronald MacDonald --AND YOU PUBLISH THEM!! - something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.<br /><br />For the religiously sensitive (now *there's* something I wasn't when I first read Toth!) the book can be sacrilegious. Novello named his hero for the insane person who defaced Michelangelo's `Pieta' back in the 70s. As if that's not insensitive enough, Toth writes to the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of the Saints to report a phony miracle (something involving chewing gum) through the intercession of California's St. Junipero Serra. This results in a couple of rounds of responses with the cardinal from the Congregation, but goes no further. Had Novello developed Toth's fictitious \\"St. Junipero Serra Prayer Group\\" a little more, the accumulated bemused responses might have been slightly humorous. As it is, his miracle correspondence is one of a collection of tossed-off jokes.<br /><br />The funniest exchanges (and there are a few) provoke shocked responses from the recipients. For instance, Toth's insistence on repopulating the war-depleted Kuwait Zoo with American squirrels and raccoons gets a panicky response from the organization actually involved. And it is surprising how many rather large organizations (GM and Anheiser-Busch) actually seem to read at least some letters and respond to them individually. Most of Toth's letters, though, are just pranks - bearding the lion in its own den.<br /><br />I wanted to give the book a 2, but for some reason felt the urge to finish it. Maybe I was hoping that the humor would all come together by the end. Alas, it did not. But to give it a 3 implies that it is worth another read. And that, dear reader, is something I cannot imagine.ults in a couple of rounds of responses with the cardinal from the Congregation, but goes no further.

The \\"argument from design\\" traces back at least to the medieval theology as a favorite proof for the existence of God. The argument runs that the exquisite design and interrelation of earthly organisms can be explained only by the existence of an Intelligent Designer.<br /><br />I continue to believe in God, but Stephen Jay Gould's essays in \\"The Panda's Thumb\\" is a rather large nail in the coffin of this argument.<br /><br />In essay after essay, Gould describes nature's mistakes and improvisations, seeming proof against the work of an intelligent designer. For instance, the \\"thumb\\" of pandas -- a specialized appendage to strip leaves from bamboo shoots -- is not a true thumb, but a weirdly-designed extension of a wrist bone. Gould demonstrates many other animal adaptations, from orchids to hermit crabs, that use unlikely body parts to perform survival tasks required by later generations of organisms.<br /><br />Gould's explanation of neoteny - the tendency of organisms to retain anatomical features from childhood - is one of his most fascinating chapters. With a simple mutation, the basis for much uniquely human behavior and anatomy comes in to focus. We humans don't develop elongated snouts like other mammals; we retain our capacity to play throughout our lives rather than abandoning it at puberty; our brains continue to grow after birth; we are helpless and dependent on our parents far longer than other mammals. And in a typically Gouldian play of ideas, he charts the changing facial features of Mickey Mouse over the years to show him being drawn with more infant -like (and therefore human-like) features - rounder head, bigger eyes, shorter snout.<br /><br />Though Gould is not a theist, \\"Panda's Thumb\\" is not an argument against God, but *for* the appropriate use of science to describe the natural world. We theists are well-served by books like this, which give us the ammunition needed to battle cultural forces that seek to blind us to the truth that lies right in front of us in the natural world and of which we are a part.world and of which we are a part.	2005-09-17

Author Stephanie Coontz's purpose is to turn a historian's eye on the ever-shifting patterns of American history, turning a cutting laser on the myths that still inform our politics and personal attitudes.<br /><br />Most of us have a reasonable familiarity with recent history - say, the last 50 years or so. There's a temptation then to assume that people in earlier ages shared our base assumptions - they were just us in different clothes. Coontz gently puts the lie to these assumptions, showing us that our ancestors and predecessors looked at the world differently and organized their societies along different lines. In the process, she destroys a number of hallowed national myths based on what is essentially a misreading of history.<br /><br />For instance, the myth of Rugged Individualism-the idea that America was founded by those who rejected governmental assistance-comes in for a thorough thrashing -- as does the idea that a man's house was his castle. In colonial America, says Coontz, government would take children away from their parents if they did not learn their alphabet by the age of six. Inability to read meant inability to read Scripture which meant an inability to be saved. Too, the rugged individualists who tamed the West were anything but. Sure, they worked hard to build their homes and harvest their crops. But without the national government's assistance in clearing the land of natives, building transportation networks and subsidizing land purchases, the westward expansion would not have occurred at the rate it did. To boot, the successful settlers were communitarian -- establishing homes near others, sharing tools and expertise. Those who chose to go it alone were the least successful, passing a culture of poverty and ignorance to future generations.<br /><br />Coontz's work is a welcome corrective to the still-flourishing myths of individualism. She has much to say to those who still think that success is their personal achievement, and who forget that success is often a collective exercise of an individual's work, government assistance (be it killing Indians or awarding tax breaks) and personal connections.<br /><br />Coontz takes on many other topics, including consumerism, working women, teenage pregnancy (the late 50s had the highest, not lowest, incidence of teen pregnancy), marriage, love, abortion rates through the centuries and much more.

When they succeed, we celebrate them as heroes, pathfinders, pioneers. But when they fail, we mock them as reckless, naïve or maybe insane.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer has crafted a highly detailed and readable account of one such lone adventurer, Chris McCandless, who from an early age marched to a different drummer. McCandless's wanderlust and idealism drew him to reject the links to the civilized world of rules, protocols and inherited lore for raw, unfiltered first-person experience. He was attracted to the road, the desert, the trackless waste. At age 24, he hitched and hiked to a remote Alaskan field to test himself against nature. 112 days later, he had starved to death, leaving in his wake a devastated family and countless questions about his motives.<br /><br />Krakauer pieces together McCandless's story from his writings, family interviews as well as testimony from the many truckers, drifters and other marginal types who met McCandless in his last months. They recall his enormous charm, his stubbornness, his hatred of externally imposed rules. Then there's his idealized regard for the world of adventure found in books by Jack London and Thoreau - men who seldom lived the life they lauded in print. Krakauer resists the temptation to paint McCandless as an empty-headed idealist. McCandless, after all, managed to survive nearly four months in a land that would have conquered most of us inside of a week. The real story of Chris's character and his death is more complex, and a bit less comforting.<br /><br />Is there a longing wired into the brains of some people to disregard comfort in search of an ultimate life-test? Krakauer has a personal reason for writing the book. He sees in McCandless an echo of his own youthful itch to test himself alone against nearly impossible odds - to achieve something no one else has done. The urge seems to puzzle Krakauer, and McCandless's trek seems the perfect vehicle for the exploring the phenomenon.<br /><br />Interestingly, my teenage son hated the book; he found McCandless's lack of common sense and his rejection of good advice a serious obstacle. But I was fascinated by the book, finding it difficult to put down. McCandless reminded me very much of St. Francis of Assisi, another young man who rejected a life of comfort and privilege for a life of poverty and holy misery and who found his muse in the natural world. Francis too died relatively young, but for a millennium has inspired thousands of others to follow in his footsteps. I also can't help hearing echoes of Christ's temptations in the desert. Can the drive that leads one young man to a lonely death in the Alaskan wild lead another to scale peaks to spiritual heights, or to discover new lands? Is there, should there, be a bit of Chris McCandless in each of us?cCandless's trek seems the perfect vehicle for the exploring the phenomenon. <br /> <br />Interestingly, my teenage son hated the book; he found McCandless's lack of common sense and his rejection of good advice a serious obstacle.

Spanning months from March 2002 through the 2004 election, Aaron McGruder successfully pierces the balloon of media self importance in the run-up to the Iraq War. He also finds supreme irony with America \\"exporting democracy\\" after the dirty tricks and insider dealing of the last two elections. Ever the equal opportunity satirist, McGruder's lampoon of John Kerry's verbal equivocation still makes me laugh nearly a year after the 2004 election.<br /><br />McGruder's critique of black networks like UPN goes over my head, as does his jabs at embarrassing black entertainers. I'm not black, but I could use a few hints about why those he targets deserve his ire. His series of strips about trying to get a boyfriend for Condoleza Rice, though, are still terrific, as are his jabs are the \\"super Nasty Jesus movie\\" (Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\"). Topical and funny are the strips when Granddad tries to explain homosexual marriage to grandsons Huey and Riley. They kids know more about it than he does, but every time they try to clarify Granddad's stammering statements, they end up getting sent to their rooms. This period also saw Bill Cosby getting a higher profile as he tried to get blacks to talk right and dress nice. McGruder respects Cosby and to some degree his message (note the lampoon of \\"Black English Month\\" on page 43), but can't help portraying him as raving and barely coherent.<br /><br />9/11 must have taken a lot out of McGruder, because it took him nearly a year of strips to get his game on. But even a wounded Boondocks is better, fresher and more thought-provoking than much of what lands in the comic pages, or the op-ed pages for that matter.	2005-08-30

The Ministry of Magic, which should be on Harry's side, is terminally and dangerously incompetent, busily arresting innocents on the charge of being Death Eaters. Meanwhile, Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts is about to begin, holding within it the promise of more responsibility and more extreme danger. There is the ever-present lure of the Dark Arts, useful to enemies and forbidden to Harry. And then there's the inconvenient triumph and trauma of falling in love.<br /><br />Such is the setting for the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth of J. K. Rowling's fanciful and fabulous Potter series. The book lives up to the series' reputation, providing new magic an more mature problems for Harry and his friends to grapple with. The book is also darker than many, with the threat of death or injury being constant companions to the main characters. As the series wears on, Harry is becoming more and more alone, having to rely on his wit, cunning and special abilities. His choices are becoming harder; his path more lonely. Rowling's genius is to make all of this trouble entertaining.<br /><br />The book includes all of the Hogwarts favorites: Hermione, the Weasleys , Dumbledore, Snape, McGonnagal and Hagrid.

It was a book easy to put down, but offered enough material that it eventually as taken up again. Boese orders the book roughly chronologically, starting with early forgeries such as the Donation of Constantine and the possibly spurious tales of Marco Polo. He moves through the ages, lightly covering well known hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant, filling in the centuries with hoaxes I had never heard of such as the various newspaper circulation-building hoaxes of the 19th century. One, the Great Moon Hoax of 1835, insisted that a new telescope had the ability to see man-bats and beavers on the moon.<br /><br />The book moves into the 20th century, discussing the Hitler Diaries hoax, Clifford Irving's hoax biography of Howard Hughes, the Tawana Brawley case and Rosie Ruiz's fake completion of the 1980 Boston marathon. The book also covers the pranks of Alan Abel, Disk Tuck and Jerry Skaggs, whose feats were more about making social statements than in hoaxing for gain or attention. In 1962, in one hilarious episode, Tuck hired pregnant women to hold signs at Nixon rallies reading \\"Nixon's the One!\\" Nixon returned the favor on the American public in a less humorous vein when Donald Segretti set up his dirty tricks operation.<br /><br />TMOH does have failings. It often chops its stories short, giving little follow-up, leaving the reader suspended in mid-air. And while the book does cover crop circles and UFOs, it remains agnostic about the truth of these and other controversial items, perhaps in fear of alienating readers. And for a book on the cleverness and slyness of human beings, it is woefully short of both values; a book on hoaxes should be fun!<br /><br />TMOH is a straightforward, light introduction to many instances where the average human intellect is deluded by tricksters and wits.	2005-08-29

Henri Nouwen was the rare soul who wrote from a soul molded by the living heart of scripture and informed by compassionate hands-on caregiving.<br /><br />BFTJ is a daily meditation guide that delves into the pith of religious experience from the Christian point of view. Nouwen's deep insights into the Eucharist are sometimes startling and far deeper than the warmed-over tripe often doled out by those of lesser spiritual prowess. But his gentle words always point with love toward healing the brokenness that is part and parcel of the human experience.<br /><br />So fascinating are Nouwen's thoughts that one is tempted to wolf them down. But taken in small mouthfuls, chewed well and digested thoroughly, they can be healing to the mind and soul. They can also prepare the reader for properly receiving the Eucharist, not as a mere matter of habit, but as a healing ritual that connects to (and overcomes) one's own sinfulness, nourishing the spirit.	2005-08-28

Beloved though its subject might be, how much can you say about a 15-line bit of verse - the 23rd Psalm ? But Rabbi Harold Kushner uses his compassion and intellect to unpack each line. Though informed by scholarship, this is not a dry scholarly exercise. Kushner uses each line as jumping-off point for a sermon on human v. divine nature, arguing that the heart of faith is not just believing in God, or thinking that God will fix our problems, but in feeling the assurance that God is present and hears us. To Kushner, comfort comes not from an assurance that God will save us from evil, but that with God we are never alone.<br /><br />Along the way, we are treated to Kushner's insights about the Pieta, creative misinterpretations of Scripture, and a heavy dose of practical psychology, as gleaned from his own community and his audiences. The experience of his own son's death 20 years ago (of progeria, a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging and premature death) hangs over the entire work. Like the biblical Job, Kushner has wrestled with the meaning of death and how we can relate to God in the midst of death and suffering. Kushner's conclusions may challenge the easy answers grasped by some people of faith. But there is no doubt that he has walked through the valley of the shadow and emerged wiser and closer to God.<br /><br />Kushner's reading of his own work (on the audio CD) is gentle, fatherly and soothing -- a glimpse into a soul full of holiness. A wonderful gift for any thoughtful Jew or Christian.	2005-08-28

A printer, inventor, statesman, diplomat and patriot, he played a huge role in bringing America to birth. Yet when he is impersonated today, it is so often as a buffoon - a wit-spilling, innocuous jolly chubby comic. Ronald Clark's \\"Benjamin Franklin: A Biography\\" puts the lie to Franklin-as-comic-distraction, placing him at the center of a very serious America drama.<br /><br />Clark takes us from Franklin's early days in Boston, a town that (sadly) he came to despise. A printer's apprentice for his overbearing and less talented brother James, young Franklin found liberation penning phony advice from a fictitious widow, Silence Dogood, and slipping them under the print shop door at night. The success of these bits of writing put Franklin on a path of self-reliance and innovation that lasted his entire life.<br /><br />Clark follows Franklin to Philadelphia where he deftly maneuvers his way into the printing business, to his scientific endeavors. Not enough of us know that Franklin's experiments in electricity (not just his kite flying) where very serious science in the 18th century. Franklin was highly regarded for the common sense way he approached the subject. Our everyday language of electricity - that it has positive and negative aspects - is Franklin's. I was surprised to know that the facts behind the story of the kite are less certain that I imagined. If the story happened (and it has a whiff of Franklin's direct and simple methods) Franklin may have been keen to keep it quiet after realized how lucky he was to have survived the experience.<br /><br />Clark details Franklin's importance to the American revolution - especially his long service as diplomat to the French, wheedling out of them the guns, uniforms and supplies the colonies desperately needed to keep fighting the British Army. Clark covers Franklin's flirtatious behavior with the noble ladies of France, but leaves it mostly up to the reader to determine whether he as just playing at seduction as was \\"a la mode\\" in elite Parisian circles, or was truly engaged in something more serious. Franklin rather paternal and often long-distance relationship with his wife Deborah is detailed via their letters.<br /><br />In short, Clark gives a us a Franklin who is an American genius, springing up at a time when the nation most needed a man of his craft, seriousness, subtlety and intelligence. You will read it and forever be dissatisfied with the vacuous impersonations that have smoothed out and tamed this must unruly of intellects.er he as just playing at seduction as was \\"a la mode\\" in elite Parisian circles, or was truly engaged in something more serious.

Lederer treats various categories of language errors - bloopers, mixed metaphors, mistranslations , etc. - in separate chapters. \\"The World According to Student Bloopers\\" -- a running history of the world allegedly taken from real student written responses -- is often hilarious. Who knew that King Solomon had 300 wives and 700 porcupines, or that Sir Francis Drake *circumcised* the world with a 100-foot clipper? I also enjoyed the chapter on two-headed headlines, some of which took some work to uncover their second meaning. \\"IKE SAYS NIXON CAN'T STAND PAT\\" is fairly obvious, but \\"CARTER PLANS SWELL DEFICIT\\" took a second or two to puzzle out.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to the book is that other than or Lederer's short and sometimes forced introductions to each chapter, the book is basically a series of lists, ordered by topic, with no indication of source. Though written in 1978 before the Internet truly got underway, the book often resembles the annoying \\"funny\\" e-mails that circulate today on the web. In Lederer's defense, I suspect that some of today's e-mails are actually rip-off's of \\"Anguished English.\\" But it would have added to his efforts if he had described the process of accumulating his trove of malapropisms, informing us about the source, rather than just laying them out, naked on the ice, as it were. That would have given the reader a bit more to chew on than the warmed over fare offered here, some of which seem too perfect to be true. For instance, it's hard to believe that the journalist who wrote, \\"IS THERE A RING OF DEBRIS AROUND URANUS?\\" didn't know exactly what he/she was doing. Yet this headline is offered as an unintentional mistake.<br /><br />For all its faults and excesses, \\"Anguished English\\" is fun and sometimes interesting.

It has hit Harry Potter like a ton of bricks, making him moody and irritable at a time when he needs his wits about him. For You-Know-Who is on the loose, dementors and convicts run amok and the world turning against Harry. No one believes his tale of Lord Voldemort's return, least of all the reactionary forces in the Ministry of Magic. The media is portraying Harry as a loose cannon and a liar, only adding loneliness and humiliation to his already-long list of troubles. Harry himself is tormented by dreams, and must struggles with the question of whether his mind is completely under his control.<br /><br />With the willfully-blind Cornelius Fudge in the ascendancy at the Ministry of Magic, hard times are coming to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Fudge is taking advantage of the public's turn against Harry to do some housecleaning, moving one of his toadies, Dolores Umbridge, into the school. Umbridge wants to return the school to a tame wizarding orthodoxy, and soon institutes a reign of repression that only adds to Harry's woes.<br /><br />\\"The Order of Phoenix,\\" the fifth in the J.K. Rowlings series on the wizarding world of Harry Potter, takes us into the world of politics as it is applied to the magical realm. As Voldemort and his acolyte Death Eaters scheme for control, the rest of the magical world is divided against itself. On one side are a small group of wizards and witches called the Order of the Phoenix, who have allied themselves with Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore to fight Voldemort. On the other side are the throngs of regular witches and wizards who are swayed by the credulous slanders against Potter and Dumbleore printed in the Daily Prophet and Quibbler. The anti-Dumbledore side is also tinged by a form of racism, in which anyone of \\"half-breed\\" status - be it centaur, half-giant like Hagrid, or a mixed-breed \\"mudblood\\" like Harry and Hermione - faces discrimination and disdain.<br /><br />Rowling's 5th book, builds upon the first four, delivering fascinating new creatures, new characters (Luna Lovegood, loopy daughter of the publisher of a scandalsheet) and new magical features of Hogwarts. The old favorites still appear - Professors McGonagall and Snape, the Dursleys and Weasleys, Sirius Black, Dobby the house-elf and many others. The sense of danger increases, as does the sense of paranoia and despair, as Harry is loaded down with far heavier burdens than any 15-year-old should have to shoulder. Yet Harry is learning to depend on his fellow students for aid, even learning that the least desirable of his acquaintances play enormously important roles in his life.<br /><br />\\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is darker than the rest, properly so in view of the rise in Voldemort's strength and influence. Yet it (like the rest of the Potter series) is human, humane, emotionally rich and full of fun and excitement.

McGruder's characters tread the terrifying knife edge of race - the topic that the rest of America doesn't want to think about, especially on the comics page. His characters are loud, proud, sometimes right, often wrong, proud, paranoid and thoroughly human. This is the issue where McGruder blames the end of Western Civilization on Vivaca A. Fox movies; where Huey unhelpfully plays marriage counselor to timid Tom and his white wife, Sarah; where Huey single-handedly attempts to hold down Kwanzaa under his grandfather's baleful glare. 9/11 also happened during this period, and McGruder mocks on the &uuml;ber-patriotism and leader-worship expected of Americans. His strip-within-a-strip, \\"The Adventures of Flagee and Ribbon\\" is wicked and right on target.<br /><br />Boondocks is always fresh, always edgy and always funny -- a welcome addition to the national dialogue.	2005-07-21

TV interviews with Vowell might give the impression that this is a lighthearted romp through the deaths of our leaders. While her book has its funny and ironic moments, Vowell truly has spent quite a bit of time haunted by this topic...much to the detriment of her social life.<br /><br />The book follows Vowell and her sister, young nephew and various boyfriends, as they travel to various sites associated with the assassinated presidents. Some sites are neglected statues to nearly forgotten leaders like Garfield and McKinley. Some sites hold more public interest, relating to artifacts associated with Abraham Lincoln. There are stops at obscure museums contain bits of bone from Lincoln or his assassin. Former sites associated with the assassination night - such as the house where Secretary of State Seward was attacked - that are now gone, victims of a century's worth of urban change. A truly creepy scene occurs in the woods near the site where John Wilkes Booth died: Vowell stumbles upon a hidden shrine to the killer of our 16th president. Sic Semper Tyrannus, indeed.<br /><br />Throughout, there is the human fascination with the remains of the dead - to desire to personally see or hold a portion of the body of a person one has known only through reading or lore. Vowell explores her own need to handle or visit these modern relics, and this brings the reader an echo of the semi-religious pursuit of connection with people of the past. To her credit, Vowell moves away from the merely macabre to discuss the political atmosphere at the time of the assassinations. Garfield's death allows her to explore the Oneida Commune in upstate New York frequented by psychotic assassin Charles Guiteau, probably the only guy who couldn't score in that free-love environment. McKinley's death gives Vowell a chance to examine the anarchist movement that was so attractive to immigrants and those dispossessed by Gilded Age America. She takes a detour to give witness to Teddy Roosevelt's heroics - including a pit stop in the Spanish-American War to witness the putatively heroic ride up San Juan hill that cemented his reputation for bravery.<br /><br />While enjoyable and informative, the book left me wanting more information about Garfield's and McKinley's deaths. Obsessed with still-extant remains, Vowell sometimes skimps on details of the actual events. And sometimes her liberal politics and observations on her personal life take her too far off-topic. But other items - like her hilarious focus on Robert Lincoln - son of Old Abe - make up for these imperfections. Bizarrely present at the assassination or death of three presidents, Lincoln earns Vowell's nickname \\"Jinxy McDeath.\\" Rubbing shoulders with so much high-profile death, Lincoln himself had a long if ordinary life, living long enough to attend the 1923 dedication of his father's memorial in Washington.

The Soviet empire may have proved impermanent. But it should not surprise us that Solzhenitsyn's tale of human endurance in the frigid sub-Arctic has outlived it.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of Ivan Denisovich, sentenced to 10 years because he had the bad form to be captured by the Germans in WWII, the book describes in delicious detail the way prisoners accommodated to their bleak existences. A small favor here, sharing a bit a bread there, secreting a bit of metal, constant edging out the others for a tiny advantage -- such was the continual fight for enough to eat, snarling at a fool, avoiding punishment and just getting along in the world's most forbidding environment. Prisoners relied on their natural cunning and resilience to make it through the unbearable days -- setting their own work goals rather than submitting to the orders of guards, conniving with each other, outwitting the lesser endowed and employing mental tricks to win tiny victories known only to themselves.<br /><br />\\"One Day\\" is equally a paean to the human spirit as it is an indictment of the mindset that could force human beings to exist in such marginal and inhospitable places.<br /><br />The book is wonderfully fleshed out by Frank Muller's narration. Muller's pace is almost too quick, but that may be an artifact (in pre-CD 1982) of needing to fit the story into 3 cassettes.	2005-07-14

A book that can be read in an evening can't be expected to deliver much of a punch. Or can it?<br /><br />\\"The Plot\\" is no lightweight. Drawn in bold, deft strokes by late graphic artist Will Eisner, the book (comic book or graphic novel, if you will) tells in pen-and-ink drawings the sordid tale of the crafting of the most notorious fake of the last century -- the anti-Semitic \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\" If ever there was a work concocted in the bowels of Hell that produced more misery than The Protocols, I am not aware of it. Purporting to be the secret plan of the Jews to dominate the world, the Protocols are a forgery plagiarized from an obscure source by a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; in the late 19th century. The purpose? To discredit his enemies in the Tsar's court by linking them with a non-existent Jewish conspiracy.<br /><br />Published, preached and propagated in Russia, the book was widely reprinted and has found it way around the globe. Even today, it is being published as true by Middle Eastern regimes. It heinous power spread the poison of Jew-hatred to new audiences. It is Eisner's goal to dilute the poison by telling the public of the book's ignominious genesis.<br /><br />Eisner does a more than creditable job of limning the main characters and events that led to the creation of this document. He even suspends his narrative for several pages to let the reader compare the Protocols against its source. Though I found this the least interesting part of the book, it gives the reader insight into the mind and method of the plagiarist.<br /><br />Sad that such a vicious and long-lasting slander took as much brainpower to create as phonying a term paper from Cliff Notes.	2005-07-14

The Church of the Latter-Day Saints - the Mormons - is only 170 years old, and had bad luck to originate in an era of high literacy and printing, leaving behind first-hand documents from its founder as well its founding generation. As such, Mormonism offers the perfect lens for observing how religion forms, what motivates its earliest adherents, and how it mutates with the years. Often this means choosing institutional survival by obscuring or inverting the putatively divine revelations entrusted to its founders.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer's \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" tells two stories. One is the story of Mormonism itself, staring with its founder, Joseph Smith, whose early years involved shady work as a psychic gold-hunter and as a charming seducer of young women, some married to other men. The Church he founded, on the supposed gold-plated revelations of the angel Moroni about a race of pre-Columbian Israelites living in the US, strikes the non-believer as laughable. Krakauer follows Smith's odd band of followers through persecution, murder, deceit of its own faithful, the tawdry martyrdom of its founder, culminating in its final triumph in the barren land of Utah.<br /><br />The second story is a modern one concerning the Lafferty brothers, adherents of a breakaway, fundamental Mormon sect that wanted to restore their Church's ancient patriarchal practice of polygamy -- and was willing to resort to kidnapping, blackmail and spousal abuse to maintain it. The brothers, sure that God ordered them to kill a trouble-making in-law, slashed the throats of their brother's young wife and infant daughter. Years later, in prison for the crime, the saner of the two brothers is still convinced that he was doing God's work, mysterious though it might be. He is completely at peace with himself, sure that one day God will vindicate him.<br /><br />To those familiar with mainstream Christianity, the story Krakauer tells is full of discomfiting echoes. \\"Prophets\\" who claim to hear God ordering the slaughter of nations; miraculous events that confirm God's favor on his chosen; unjustifiable violence, war and rapine in the name of God. Interestingly Krakauer does not attempt to persuade us that the LDS's prophets (or any others) are charlatans. He seems to conclude that religiosity is real -- a human instinct as powerful as sex and hunger that is part of the human condition -- not necessarily requiring the existence of God. When certain influential people trigger this instinct by persuading others of their inner experiences, the results can either be the most sublime of human endeavors, or the most vile.<br /><br />Krakauer invites us to ponder the possibility that religiosity -- whether experienced by a Joseph Smith, a Moses, a Jesus, a Mohammed or an Osama bin Laden - is a completely sincere response to voices that our human natures have wired into our brains.

This book will confirm that it's about and 20/80 split. \\"Nothing's Sacred\\" is a mildly interesting biography of Black's childood and college years. But there's not enough personal information to give the reader a peek into his psyche. I would have enjoyed reading about Black's struggle to succeed as a comedian. But he leaves us in the dark about that. Every now and then, Black swerves off into a banal rant about government, but without his trademark middle-age rage, there's not much new here.<br /><br />There are exactly two over-the-top moments in the book. One is on the cover, showing Black displacing Christ in Michelangelo's Pieta -- cheap blasphemy. The other is Black's repetition (from another comic!) of a horribly tasteless joke about JFK's assassination. So much for shock value. The book is worthy of 2 stars.

Greeley intertwines a number of stories (with an all-Irish cast) to construct his tale. There's the strained-to-breaking marriage of a Catholic journalistic couple - Dennis Mulloy of the NY Times and Patricia of CNN. There's young and adorable \\"princess\\" Paoli, scion of an Italian royal family, who adds to the marital tension via her job as Mulloy's Roman tour guide. Bishop \\"Blackie\\" Egan, aide to Cardinal Cronin of Chicago. There's Mark - an unbalanced would-be assassin who hates abortionists. The archbishop of Valencia, a liberal with family secrets who is quickly becoming the perceived front runner in the papal horse race. And there's the shadowy conservative cabal, \\"Corpus Christi\\" -- really a thinly-veiled Opus Dei -- that resorts to dirty tricks to smear its liberal enemies.<br /><br />The cassette version of the book is told in endless bursts of dialog. That's too bad, because the book version includes Greeley's reflections on Church politics and the real-life Banco Ambrosiano scandal -- surely of more interest to serious readers. As it is, the story dashes along quickly, with plenty of sex and violence and intrigue. I have to say that Greeley's view of marital sex is more evolved than that of much of the rest of the Church's leadership. Yet he has a fixation on the female upper torso that is not healthy for a married man, never mind a cleric.<br /><br />As prophecy, \\"White Smoke\\" is a bust (pun not originally intended); electing even a moderate pope seems beyond the capacity of the College of Cardinals. Still, the book is a harmless diversion, and loads of fun, in spite of being a poor predictor of the result of recent papal elections.	2005-06-11

Its singles are dying for marital stability but put off by middle class banality. Its marrieds long for freedom from children and responsibility. Bridget herself veers crazily between a life of infinite choice and one often spent depressed and alone.<br /><br />BJD's characters are appallingly wonderful. Bridget's dotty mother, with her Portuguese paramour and wild ways; Mark Darcy, the dull, recently-divorced barrister in diamond-pattern cardigan and bumblebee socks; Perpetua, the big-bottomed terror of Bridget's office; Richard Finch, the incoherent producer of the celebrity-mad \\"Good Afternoon!\\" television show; and Bridget's cast of dysfunctional yet sweet office friends - Jude, Shaza and gay Tom.<br /><br />Kudos to Helen Fielding for assembling such a wild group and making it human, repulsive, likable and real. Sadly, the 6-cassette unabridged narration by Barbara Rosenblat (an utter joy!) no longer seems available. Check your local library!	2005-06-11

There's nothing I love more than a history that, while debunking the myths about the achievements of a man of genius, manages to make his achievement even grander. Ross King's \\"Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling\\" is a proud entry into this category.<br /><br />King has crafted a masterpiece that centers on the 4-year period during which Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. But there is so much more. Ross also discusses Pope Julius II - known as \\"Il Papa Terribile\\" for his outsized personality and ferocity. Under Julius's auspices, Michelangelo and Raphael, the two star frescoists of the day, were pitted head to head like a pair of fighting cocks, much to the distress of the suspicious and self-pitying Michelangelo. Ross introduces you to the art scene of the early 16th century, the height of fresco painting. By the end of the book, you will have become thoroughly familiar with the terms and methods of the trade-\\"cartone, \\"intonaco,\\" \\"buon fresco,\\" \\"spalvero,\\" \\"ultramarine\\"-and be able to appreciate the vast talent and ego needed to work in the medium.<br /><br />Ross uses Michelangelo's own letters and other primary material to demolish myths associated with the painting. I won't disclose these, but they involve the posture in which Michelangelo painted as well as his collaboration (or lack thereof) with other artists. Ross also sheds light on many aspects of Italian life of the period - the periodic flooding of the Tiber, Michelangelo's family troubles and love life, papal and local politics, the low esteem in which artists were held (and consequent moderate pay), ornate and church ceremony - even Martin Luther makes an appearance on his fateful 1510 trip to Rome.<br /><br />There is so much fascinating detail in the books - from the way paints were created, to Michelangelo's constantly-deferred dream of sculpting Julius II's tomb, to the way popes went to war, to the controversy over the design of the scaffolding on which the painter was to work. A master work.<br /><br />John Lee's narration on the audio CD was terrific - trilled Rs and all.n Lee's narration on the audio CD was terrific - trilled Rs and all.	2005-05-05

It was Papa Luciani who shocked the hard core in the Vatican (and delighted the rest of us) by congratulating the parents of the first test tube baby. It was \\"The Smiling Pope\\" who said that there was \\"more of Mama in Almighty God than Papa,\\" catching attention of even me, who had fallen away from the Church at that time.<br /><br />Papa Luciani's death after 33 days was a profound shock. It's no surprise that rumors arose quickly that the pope had been murdered. Cornwell was asked to investigate the rumors, and \\"A Thief in the Night\\" is the result. What Cornwell uncovers is not a murder, but a Vatican culture of clerical bitchiness, lackadaisy, professional malfeasance and deferral to papal prerogative. Cromwell reports that Luciani was not respected at the Vatican. His precarious health (he had a history of life-threatening blood clots) was not monitored by the Vatican medical staff. He admitted to being overwhelmed by the job and he prayed for death often. Yet these signs of distress were ignored or misunderstood by the clerics surrounding him.<br /><br />The book is the best narrative of the pope's death I have read. Cornwell interviewed members of the Vatican news media, the undertakers who embalmed the body, the head of the Vatican bank (who was implicated in a scandal that some thought connected with the pope's death), family members, medical experts, and \\"Monsignore Sotto Voce,\\" Cornwell's inside-the-Vatican \\"Deep Throat.\\" What rings true are the contradictions in the various recollections of what occurred the night the pope died. Too many conspiracy books tie all loose ends together, leaving no room for lapses of memory and plain human stupidity. Cornwell avoids this trap except in one instance, in which he attempts to reconcile the somewhat conflicting stories of two of the pope's closest aides. Cornwell accounts for the discrepancies (spoiler ahead!) by having the two move the body in order that it be \\"found\\" in a more papal posture - reading sermons in bed. This conclusion would require that each aide be involved in a decade of lying about his own movements and those of the other conspirator. While it is not out of the question for clerics to desire to put the best face on a bad outcome (even to the point of hiding the truth), it is up to the reader to determine whether Cornwell made his case.<br /><br />Long story short? Papa Luciani was a victim of his frail health, his own sense of unworthiness and of his aides' excessive deference to the papal office.

Adam Nicolson does a masterful job of exploring the politics and personalities behind the creation of the King James Bible. I was especially fascinated by the interplay between various early 17th century Protestant sects - Puritans, Episcopalians and Congregationalists. Students of American history will get a better feel for why the Puritans--western Christianity's equivalent of the Taliban--might have been so unwelcome at home. The King James Bible was in part an answer to the Puritan's Geneva Bible, which used deliberately-slanted anti-monarchical translations (e.g., using \\"tyrant\\" for \\"king\\"!) that made it politically annoying, even subversive.<br /><br />While I enjoy the King James style, Nicolson was weakest when trumpeting the superiority of the King James to other contemporaneous translations. Seeing various versions side by side, it wasn't altogether clear to me that the King James was the obviously better choice. It doesn't hurt that the king is behind your version. That being said, \\"God's Secretaries\\" was a terrific read, full of the anecdotal information that brings history alive.	2005-04-22

And God bless him. Love him or hate him, he makes the strongest case for the weakness of a centralized church hierarchical of anyone I have ever read.<br /><br />In \\"Hitler's Pope,\\" Cornwell lays out the case that Eugenio Pacelli, later to become Pope Pius XII, was instrumental in both the rise of Italian fascism and the coddling of Nazi Germany both before and during World War II. Cornwell describes Pacelli as a rather delicate youth, pious, devoted to a life of prayer, and a bit of a cosseted mama's boy. Rising through church ranks, enamored of the perquisites of church office, he became the Vatican Secretary of State for Pope Pius X. In that position, he busied himself brokering concordats with various European governments. What's damning about this activity is that Pacelli, as representative of a centralized head of state, preferred to deal with other strong centralized heads of state. That some of these - Mussolini, Hitler, Franco and Salazar- were autocratic or totalitarian, was of little issue. Strong leaders could be counted on to enforce concordats in ways that democrats and pluralists could not. But Cornwell goes further to detail Pacelli's gutting of the Italian People's Party and the German Central Party, both of which were the only credible obstacles to Fascist and Nazi rule. By stripping moderate groups of papal support, Pacelli paved the way for a war that ravaged Europe in the 1940s.<br /><br />Cornwell's case for Pius XII's \\"silence\\" in the face of Nazi terror was easily made. Despite his dislike of Nazism, Pius XII said nothing as Rome's Jews were deported from under the very gaze of St. Peter's. This silence was deafening in comparison to his continued vociferousness toward Communism - even toard those who had liberated Italy during the war. Pacelli was as blind to terror and tyranny from the right as he was hypersensitive to the same style of government from the left. Yet both right and left (the Nazi in particular) were antagonistic to the Church. Even church-friendly governments that left the churches open entangled the Church in secular rule that was murderous and antithetical to the tenets of Christianity.<br /><br />I criticize Cornwell only for his unrelievedly negative tone and judgements. There is practically nothing that Pacelli said or did that Cornwell can't see as sinister. On the other hand, his book is a welcome anodyne to the glowing and fallacious encomiums generated by Pacelli's supporters, which downplay or deny Pacelli's unintended assistance to the Nazi cause.<br /><br />Take this book with a grain of salt, if you must,  but take it seriously. It is a straightforward and right-headed exposition of the double weaknesses in Roman Catholicism leaders - their love affair with autocrats (i.e., their distrust of people's movements) and their determined attempts to lie about it to others and to themselves.

But too bitter by half	If you are looking for a gauzy, sweet biography of Pope John Paul II in these days since his death on April 2, please look elsewhere. If you are interested in a frank and sometimes brutal look at his life and policies, read on!<br /><br />In \\"The Pontiff in Winter,\\" John Cornwell (author of \\"Hitler's Pope\\") casts his gimlet eye on Karol Woytila, the man who became Pope John Paul II, from his early years through the decline of his health and (Cornwell argues) papacy in the first years of the 21st century.<br /><br />\\"The Pontiff in Winter\\" combines biography, history and analysis -- in more or less equal parts -- as it seeks to understand the Pope as a person, and the value of his teaching to the Church and mankind. Cornwell is absolutely unsentimental about his subject, giving praise where due, but zeroing in with devastating effect on the Pope's weakness and missteps. The multi-faceted man who emerges is both repelling and attractive: intelligent though not brilliant; a victim of totalitarians yet autocratic; an actor (even a bit of a prima donna) whose public, smiling persona masks a desire to be center stage; a man of true and extreme piety with a weakness for its more outlandish manifestations.<br /><br />Cornwell sees John Paul as a man embodying maddening contradictions. A wily and successful fighter for freedom in his native Poland, John Paul II did not trust others (e.g., Archbishop Oscar Romero) to do the same. Claiming to support Vatican II, he gutted its central push to decentralize the papacy and increase collegiality among bishops. Advancing the Church's relations with Jews and Muslims, he nevertheless undercut that pose by denying the status of \\"Church\\" to non-Catholic religious bodies like the Anglicans. The seeming champion of women's dignity, he attempted to shut down discussion of the divisive topic of female ordination.<br /><br />The book's extremely negative tone is its main weakness. Cornwell seems to take the Pope's faults personally. Still, there are very few places where the limitations of papal pronouncements can be aired with such erudition and passion. In the current atmosphere, in which dissent from Church teaching is equated with disloyalty, Cornwell's voice is truly prophetic, leading the mind to consider perspectives that are worth considering.the limitations of papal pronouncements can be aired with such erudition and passion.

The tales touch on truly creepy moments of life -- trying to deal with an obsessive sister; befriending the lonely child next door whose behavior borders on the demonic; the ghoulishness of writing about the process of writing  about one's own family; being kicked out of the house for being gay; being \\"Uncle Faggot\\" to the children of one's yahoo younger brother; the macabre turn of giving directions to lost travelers while one is trying to drown a mouse. As always, there is as much pain as there is laughter in Sedaris's writing; as much freakishness as frankness. Always, you often recognize your own story in the excesses of Sedaris's.<br /><br />Most of the stories on the CD were read in Sedaris's sad and tremulous  voice. But several stories were taped before audiences. Sedaris perks ups when reading to others, giving his writing a hilarious, naughty edge that does not come across when he reads alone.<br /><br />A caution of sorts: Sedaris's homosexuality is a prominent and vital feature of his personality and his writing.

Their weakness is that their perfection sometimes masks a banality of subject matter and narrative, often sinking them beyond the level of illustration. \\"National Geographic: the Photographs\\" embodies both aspects of the magazine's photography.<br /><br />While more than a few photos barely rise above the snapshot level, most are thoughtfully (if a bit too artfully) composed, though a few are absolutely standouts. Steve McCurry's haunting 1984 shot of Sharbat Gula, the green-eyed Afghan refugee girl, is the classic example. The girl's haunted expression speaks volumes about the hardships she has experienced. The photo graces the book's cover, while her updated portrait, shot 18 years later, adorns the back. Now a wife and mother, the same hauntedness appears in Gula's eyes, now encased in a face grown older and wearier. Another standout -- an overhead shot of camels traversing the wastes of Djibouti -- is disconcerting until one recognizes the camera's vantage point. The straightforward grace of some photos belies the difficulty with which they were taken. It takes only a second to flip past an underwater picture of an approaching hippo; but the photograph cannot capture the hours of patience and luck it took to take it.<br /><br />\\"National Geographic: The Photographs\\" includes the expected pictures of wildlife, nature and human cultures from around the globe as well as several topical spreads -- Spain, sleep, and the Titanic. The book's large format helps many photos communicate the grandeur of their natural subjects. When the subject and composition coincide, the photographs are strikingly beautiful.	2005-03-10

Anyone who has tried to arrange photos in an album knows what a pain it is to put history in order, even when you were part of  it. What you have done for your photos, David Hackett Fischer has done to the New York and New Jersey campaigns of 1776-1777. Fischer has brought order to the diaries, dispatches and reminiscences of many of the actors who played roles in the Trenton-Princeton campaign -- a campaign that gave new hope to a revolution that was faltering and on the verge of failure.<br /><br />Fischer masterfully lays out his tale, using a trove of evidence about the players, describing how their competence and worldview played into the way events turned on December 26, 1776. Fischer describes the British way of fighting, rightly considered the most professional and feared of its day. His chapter on the Hessians makes it clear that Washington was not fighting a band of drunks at Trenton, but a regiment of proud, able professionals who had withstood a wearying week of harassment by American raiding parties. Americans are described in their varied rambunctiousness, anxious enough to fight, but loathe to be led. Washington is portrayed as an eminent aristocratic Virginian, initially at a loss to lead the fractious rebels under his command.<br /><br />Fischer brilliantly evokes the battles leading up to Trenton and those that followed. He makes it easy to imagine oneself on the fields of battle. Along the way, one shares the miseries of the Americans revolutionaries -- trudging barefoot over icy ground, sleeping without the tents they had to abandon when New York fell, enduring bitterly cold night marches in blinding snow. The crossing of the Delaware is depicted as enormously difficult: 2 of 3 crossings failed entirely due to the impossibility of maneuvering around house-size ice floes barreling down the river. Fischer shows great respect for the fighting style and bravery of all armies. He does not shrink from detailing the atrocities that lost the British whatever public support they might have had. Neither does he shrink from expressing his deep admiration of George Washington, the commander of towering determination, flexibility and action, who brilliantly out-generaled the British and Hessians and managed to forge his undisciplined troops into a potent fighting force.<br /><br />Nelson Runger, who read the book for the audio CD, was excellent, adopting light accents (British, German, Celtic, Yankee, Virginian) for different characters. Keeping this up over 15 CDs was an amazing feat, and helped to bring the story alive.<br /><br />\\"Washington's Crossing\\" is an awesome work. It ably illustrates Fischer's thesis that decisions by individuals can have enormous effects on history. Washington's crossing of the Delaware, and the succeeding victories in Trenton, Princeton, and the New Jersey \\"Forage War\\" succeeded in large part because of the unsummoned contributions of men and women to the Cause.

To me, the only way to experience the power of King's word is to hear them as he preached them. His slow, halting starts; his slow build ups; his hoarse, shouting, growling and resonant voice; ideas that are recombined and developed from speech to speech; King's evident weariness, outrage and persistence; and the enthusiastic, rapturous response of his audiences come across infinitely better on audio than they do on the printed page.<br /><br />\\"A Call to Conscience\\" highlights King at his best. His erudition and breadth of knowledge were astounding; his ability to apply the words of Jesus and Gandhi to the civil rights struggle connected abstract principles of religion and civil disobedience to real life suffering; his commitment to end segration and discrimation by non-violent means was awe-inspiring; his desire to build a loving brotherhood of all races was visionary; his willingness to suffer without bitterness at the hands of his enemies sets him high and apart from many in the human race. Each speech is introduced by someone involved with King and the struggle for equality. Speeches are often followed by gospel music sung during the movement. Taken together, these elements comprise an elegant and moving tribute to a man whose words and actions propelled America out of self-imposed hypocrisy, and toward a world in which all are measured by the content of our character, and not the color of our skins.	2005-01-26

Books	5	24	29	N	N	Like, a gnarly work to hopefully be proud of	With characteristic wit, intellect and open-mindedness, Robert McNeil and William Cran explore the protean version of English used in America. Though they give ample time to the prescriptivist side of the argument (the side concerned with enforcing rules and determining standards of proper usage), they are clearly more in the descriptivist camp, fascinated by the way the language is actually used.<br /><br />The times are on their side. Informal language, once kept out of dictionaries and standards guides by the educated elite, is rushing into normal use at breakneck speed. These days, a word is hardly coined before it has been snatched up by major media outlets and put into print. And rushed out of print almost as quickly. Last week, I heard the word \\"gnarly\\" used to described a snowstorm. My teenage son was appalled. \\"When was the last time you heard anyone say 'gnarly'?\\" he asked incredulously. Mind you, this word is all of 10 years old, and it is already considered pass&eacute;.<br /><br />McNeil and Cran describe the way American language standards are affected by the media, social trends, technology, the tastes of elites, regional accents, racial history and even civic pride. Yet they claim that accent leveling --the homogenizing of regional speech patterns -- is largely a myth. In spite of the disappearance of certain isolated regional accents and vocabulary -- like those of Down East Maine -- some accents are actually growing in strength. Pittsbughers, for instance, are consciously proud of their distinctive pronunciations, a fact that keeps them (the pronunciations) alive. Too, most people (including this writer) don't usually consider themselves to have accents at all. Our own speech is \\"normal\\"; it's those other folks who have accents!<br /><br />Those wishing to build predictable, enduring rules for American English are bound to dislike this book. McNeil and Cran even demolish the idea that these rules have even been around for a long time. Many were decided, after long years of variation, in the last few decades by a single influential writer. The idea of taming the use of English, when it is being twisted and molded into new shapes almost daily, seems a fool's errand. Long-fought causes now seem lost -- restricting \\"hopefully\\" to mean \\"It is hoped that\\" rather than the more common, \\"filled with hope\\"; using \\"impact\\" only as a noun; using \\"indices\\" (rather than \\"indexes\\") as the plural of \\"index\\"; the unstoppable American habit of splitting infinitives. Yet McNeil and Cran urge us not to despair. We are witnessing not the degeneration of English, but its continual evolution.

Then there are those like Tim Unsworth who feel the term \\"Catholic\\" needs more flexibility.<br /><br />\\"Catholics on the Edge\\" is a book about people who consider themselves Catholic, but who find themselves marginalized within their own Church. His heroes and heroines are those who find their consciences at odds with Church teaching or practice. Patty Crowley, who was part of Pope Paul VI's mid-1960's commission to study birth control, feels that the real-life experience of faithful Catholics was ignored when the Church formulated its doctrines on the issue. In spite of heartaches and setbacks, Barbara Blaine, founder of SNAP (Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests), works with those abused by clergy, victims who have been seen as the enemy by some chanceries. Other Catholics -- former priests, those with non-traditional views on euthanisia, women seeking admission to the priesthood -- find voice in Unsworth's compassionate prose, expressing their desire to reform the Church.<br /><br />Unger's subjects are sincere individuals striving for the truth the best they know how. It bothers them that they can't reconcile the truth of their experience with the truth proclaimed by the Church. In some cases, their truth may prophetically confronts the Church, embodying the voice of the Holy Spirit to adapt its teaching to new times. In other cases, their truth is theirs alone -- springing from lack of understading, or from inevitable reactions to physical abuse or abuse of trust.<br /><br />The book has weaknesses. It should not be assumed that those who disagree with the Church are necessarly on the side of truth and right. Neither does this book present a thorough debate of the issues. And by presenting only people with problems, it might lead some readers to believe that those who agree with the Church are a small and mean-spirited minority. But agree with them or not, one's heart goes out to those who carry the burden of wrestling with truth -- not in the pure air of the abstract theologian, but in the fetid miasma that is life on the front lines. It is a battlefield where truth is often less than clear and where answers prescribed from afar can seem positively diabolical.with them or not, one's heart goes out to those who carry the burden of wrestling with truth -- not in the pure air of the abstract theologian, but in the fetid miasma that is life on the front lines.

Maybe it was Sedaris's down-on-his luck history, his brooding delivery, or Ira Glass's fabulous production, but the readings (and their musical segu&eacute;s) were masterpieces. They captured all the ironies of the Christmas holiday -- the humiliation of grown people wearing elf costumes to bring in a few bucks; the madness of parents force-feeding reluctant children into the gaping maw of Macy's Christmas machine; the delicious naughtiness of elves cavorting behind the snowy scenery; the stinginess of the retail business to its own employees.<br /><br />Now that Sedaris has become successful, his readings have lost their desperate edginess. And without Glass's sure and sensitive production, they lose their aural appeal.

If I had my way, their names and biographies would be lost to oblivion. What a perverse way to ensure one's name in history books: the cowardly (and often easy) murder of an inspiring leader.<br /><br />That said, \\"American Brutus\\" is an invaluable volume that sheds light on the enigmatic figure at the center of one of America's darkest hours -- the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Historian Michael Kauffman paints John Wilkes Booth as what the evidence says he was: a brilliant actor with an erratic personality, dizzy with the need for fame; a man obsessed with making a name for himself by striking a blow for the Confederate cause when it was all but lost; a man at the periphery of great events (and great wealth) who lied compulsively to be seen as more important than he was; a man who used blackmail and false promises of great fortune to bind to himself a small group that would help carry out his murderous plots.<br /><br />\\"American Brutus\\" makes real the alien and fascinating world of the April 1865. It was a day of gaslights and horse travel; a world where a personal introduction meant far more than a mere exchange of names; where soldiers protected the White House property, but left its occupant unshieded in public. It's hard to imagine now (in this day of ubiquitous forensics TV shows) how the Ford's Theater crime scene was stripped of artifacts soon after the assassination. Booth's derringer and even Lincoln's clothing were taken as souvenirs by casual visitors to the presidential box. The political atmosphere was equally bizarre. The degree of hatred for Lincoln by Democrats -- who saw him as a tyrant in the mold of Napoleon and George III -- was shocking, especially in wartime. Maryland, Booth's home state, where Lincoln's harshest and most restrictive measures were laid on the restive populace, was crisscrossed by smugglers and spies and rebel sympathizers. The state of medicine was primitive. A roomful of doctors could do nothing for the wounded president but to monitor and record his pulse rate and respiration, occassionally poking around in the wound while waiting for the inevitable end.<br /><br />Kauffman provides these and many more details as he describes Booth's central role in shaping the conspiracies to capture or assassinate Lincoln. He tells of Booth's measures to entangle others in his scheme, and the way he silenced them with threats of exposure. Kauffman also describes Booth's complex motives for killing the president. Imbued with equal parts Confederate leaning, personal grandiosity, and perhaps a touch of the family madness, Booth believed he would be hailed as a modern day Brutus, striking down a tyrant. There's real pathos when Kauffman describes Booth reading news accounts of the crime that paint him as a base coward.<br /><br />Kaufmann details the 10-day manhunt for the killer, Booth's death at the Garrett Farm and the subsequent trial of the other conspirators. Kauffman is at his most persuasive when he details the flimsy case against the conspirators and the appalling state of the law  in 1865. The defendants were treated like animals, had two days to prepare a defense, and were denied protections that are considered standard today. The procecution could and did hide evidence that might have save one or more of the defendants. Kaufmann's narration raises serious questions about the involvement of Dr. Mudd and Mrs. Surratt in Booth's schemes.<br /><br />\\"American Brutus\\" is a master work of history narrative that makes for compelling reading. Kauffman has used his historian's instincts to mold a narrative that discerns the probable truth behind conflicting and confused evidence. His Booth is a man driven by high principles and inner demons, who planned and committed one of history's most heinous acts. The book's title stands both for Booth's personal identification with tyrant killers of the glorious past, and with the bitter irony of history's less exalted verdict of his deed.with the bitter irony of history's less exalted verdict of his deed. <br />	2005-01-19

Strangely enough, the book does not achieves its first goal, and leaves the second for the reader to pursue. Yet, it is quite worthwhile reading. I listened to the abridged audio version of the book, and was honored to hear John McCain reading from his own writing. Here is a man who has demonstrated enormous courage and resilience, yet whose voice expresses great humility, and the sure knowledge that even greater exemplars of heroism exist. McCain is a person who has experienced the limits of his own courage, and the lack of bravado in his voice is awe-inspiring.<br /><br />McCain admits that defining courage is easy enough -- taking action that is dangerous or worthy without regard to one's personal safety or reputation. But prior to our need for courage, who can tell which of us will rise up to challenges, and which of us will run? McCain has seen enough of life's challenges, including five years in a North Vietnamese prison, to know that it's not always the physically strong who have the greatest reserves of courage. And he frankly seems at a loss for giving his readers a program for increasing their own personal courage. The best he can do, he admits, is to let them hear stories of others' courage, hoping some of it will stick at the moment of crisis.<br /><br />McCain's stories of heroism are the core and glory of \\"Why Courage Matters.\\" He picks stories from wartime and from political struggles. He chronicles the March on Selma through the eyes of civil rights leader Carl Lewis. He tells the story of Aung San Suu Kyi, who for decades has risked arrest and death to stand up to the thugs who rule Burma. He tells of unsung soldier heroes of Vietnam and Korea, who disregarded their own safety in almost comic-book-style martial performances that allowed their buddies to survive. These stories are riveting, and they show the degree to which some human beings are able to overcome fear and intimidation in the pursuit of right.<br /><br />McCain is correct. His stories *are* an inspiration to courage. They help us learn to face our fears of losing life, comfort, wealth or reputation -- and to overcome those fears in the pursuit of worthy goals that are larger than any of us.eings are able to overcome fear and intimidation in the pursuit of right.  <br /> <br />McCain is correct.

Augustine, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas and others have contributed deep and influential material to this most difficult subject.<br /><br />And then, there \\"Evil: A Primer\\" by William Hart, a former journalist and \\"public policy research associate.\\"<br /><br />\\"Evil\\" is a broad, shallow retrospective of various approaches to the subject. Hart surveys the way various disciplines have approached the topic - including religion, the legal system, psychoanalysis and sociobiology. In his opinion, their answers are wanting. Ultimately, Hart concludes that evil is \\"part of the program\\" and \\"the price of being human.\\" Kind of seems to me that just gave up on the question.<br /><br />The book does have some interesting sections. The chapter on cursing (\\"May you marry your mother-in law!\\") was funny and educational: I may give cursing a try. Other chapters explored little-considered aspects of the problem of evil. For instance, how does one define, consistently, whether a crime is depraved or especially heinous? Why does mutilating a corpse (which can't feel any pain, after all) raise an ordinary murder to the level of depravity? Hart's questions about the value of \\"evil\\" in the form of lust and aggression - both deeply rooted in our biology - are important. His discussion of whether all lies are evil almost builds to something. But just when an answer comes into view, he veers away, wringing his hands that the problem has no solution.<br /><br />Those looking for real answers to the problem of evil will have to keep looking. If \\"Evil\\" represents Hart's depth as a moralist, he'd be smart to keep his day job.	2005-01-13

Anyone familiar with US history knows that certain historical eras were marked by fear and hostility of we \\"papists\\" and \\"Romanists.\\" A getting-to-know-you book is not a crazy idea. Using photographs of a variety of Catholic churches and settings, McBrien shows Catholics at public and private worship -- at Mass, during Baptisms, anointing the sick, and so on.<br /><br />As helpful as the book sometimes is, it does have significant drawbacks. McNeil's photos were taken in a variety of settings -- from American churches of the Latin and Orthodox rite, to St. Peter's in Rome, to Hispanic settings, to out-of-the-way locations I could not identify and which were not well-identified in the credits. A photo supposedly illustrating a sanctuary has no visible altar or lectern -- a perplexing omission. If I, a lifelong Catholic in a ministerial master's program, was confused by this hodge-podge of images, imagine the reaction of someone less experienced.<br /><br />Missing from illustrations was evidence of Catholic devotional life (except for one photo of a woman holding a rosary and a vignette of the Stations of the Cross). Catholic music is represented by a page of Gregorian chant, something 90% of Catholics have never heard of. There are no shots of Catholics as lectors or Eucharistic ministers, and so on. The photographs varied widely in quality, from National Geographic beauty and compositional grace down to photos that seemed cut out of the local newspaper.<br /><br />If I were writing a book aimed at explaining Catholic worship to an audience of possibly-hostile non-Catholics, I would have omitted references to the supposedly pagan roots of some Catholic practices. Christmas trees (shown in a sanctuary at Christmas) and the Easter lilies (used as Easter decoration) may well have been used for pagan purposes millennia ago, but their liturgical use is hardly unique with Catholics. Pointing out the pre-Christian origin of these items just brings up the old libel that Catholic practices are barely-papered-over idolatrous practices.<br /><br />\\"Inside Catholicism\\" is beautiful in its own way, but I wouldn't suggest it as an aid to prospective Catholics or as an apologia to someone with anti-Catholic leanings.eir liturgical use is hardly unique with Catholics.

If you're going to create a pictorial accompaniment to a controversial movie, AT LEAST PUT IN THE BEST PICTURES!!!<br /><br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" intersperses stills from the movie with snippets from the passion section of the gospels. But whatever its value as a devotional or meditative aid, it is missing nearly all of the over-the-top images from the movie. There's no snake in Gethsemane; no clear image of Satan; no Jesus hanging off the bridge; no demon children hounding Judas; none of the nastiest scourging scenes; no long stairway to ascend with the cross; no shroud image on Veronica's cloth; no flipping Jesus on his face; no shoulder dislocation; no eye-piercing crow.<br /><br />Virtually none of the images that stayed with me from the movie are included. I wonder why not? Were these scenes too gruesome when transferred to the printed page? Or were they rendered silly when they could be studied at leisure? I can't figure out Mel Gibson for adding these gruesome scenes to the film. I understand less why he left them out of the book. Weird.	2005-01-06

He has the endearing ability to mine his painful childhood and his unsuccessful early adulthood, emerging with nuggets of wit and rich humor. He also has the dreadful power to translate uncomfortable experiences into discomforting reading. I can't think of another writer whose pain and humiliations are so literally gut-wrenching.<br /><br />\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a compilation of stories having language as their theme, centering on Sedaris's own pathetic attempts to learn French. His classics include \\"Jesus Shaves\\" -- a hilarious vignette of beginner French students trying to explain Easter to a Muslim student; \\"Go Carolina\\" -- a bittersweet memory of being singled out to correct a speech \\"impediment\\" common with unpopular kids; \\"12 Moments In The Life Of The Artist\\" -- a skewering of the pretensions of performance art;  \\"I'll Eat What He's Wearing\\" -- Sedaris describing his father's peculiar eating habits. Sedaris's sense of the absurd is almost superfluous; all he needs to do is describe the weird people he encounters (attracts?) In any event, Sedaris draws the listener eagerly back for more of his tales of the bizarre and the all-too-recognizable.<br /><br />I highly recommend the audio CD, voiced by Sedaris himself. His tinny and timid voice is a perfect cover for his ironic barbs. Several of his stories were recorded before live audiences. These are actually less successful than his straight readings, transforming Sedaris's understated humor into a string of guffaw lines. It was somewhat like trying to enjoy the subtleties of a fine wine when at every sip, the folks at the neighboring table boorishly sing its praises. Nevertheless, it's heartening that this son of failure has found his muse and ridden to fame.	2005-01-03

Now he just seems to hate people. Twisted with malice, relishing experiences that should cause him remorse, he has become the poster child for \\"When Atheists Go Bad.\\" He has truly run out of material if the best he can offer is this batch of pointless profanity, vulgarity, blasphemy and sacrilege. Other than the mildly interesting sections on euphemisms (the basis of my 2-star rating), this book is just trash.<br /><br />Carlin hates Christianity, reserving his most bitter venom for his own Catholic Church. He \\"jokes\\" that he has paid for at least one abortion. As a Roman Catholic, I am truly sorry for whatever turned him into such a self-absorbed misanthrope. It's sad that he can't see past his childhood hurts and get over his self-lacerating hatred of Christians.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother defending my view from reviewers who assume that I am a Christian without a sense of humor, as though those two characteristics necessarily go together. I pray that they learn to distinguish humor (even crude humor) from mere vulgarity.<br /><br />This book is little more than the desperate plea by a has-been for a little more public attention. Some pages have over a dozen profanities and/or extremely crude sexual references. Carlin targets almost every vulnerable group -- from blind girls (who are worth nothing but for their skills in bed - ha! ha!) to the handicapped. Like a naughty 8th-grader, he invents a sex scene between St. Joseph and the Virgin Mary (ho! ho!). Take away the profanity and hatefulness, and there's not much left to this tiny volume.	2004-12-16

There is no rock so heavy or so insignificant or so well-guarded that he will not try to lift it up for a look at the critters scurrying about beneath.<br /><br />\\"Will they ever trust us again?\\" is a line Moore used in \\"Fahrenheit 911.\\" He was referring to the willingness of our armed forces to encounter danger, injury and death in order to defend our country. All they ask in return is that when we send them, it's for a good and noble reason.<br /><br />Moore's book is a compilation of the letters and e-mail he has received from service men and women who have returned from service in Iraq or are currently serving there. It's also from their families and friends and from retired servicemen. The letters express many common themes: the Iraq war is not about freedom for the Iraqi people; the Bush Administration lied about the reasons for going to war; soldiers would rather face jail than going back. Many letters thank Moore personally for his work publicizing the truth about the war. It's clear from the letters that the anti-war view is far from the majority opinion of many soldiers. Still, it is extraordinary that so many would risk a letter to Michael Moore; never mind the many who courageously allow their names to be published.<br /><br />Those against the war will no doubt see these letters as justification for their views: that Iraq is becoming another pointless war, like Vietnam; that Bush and his cronies don't care about the troops or the nation, but about their own economic and political interests. Those who support the war will doubtless be annoyed that soldiers so openly question the motives of their commander-in-chief; that Michael Moore has made it easy to do so; that Moore is self-servingly (and seditiously) offering free copies of his movies to any soldier who asks.<br /><br />Like Vietnam, the Iraq conflict will require time before a consensus emerges on its value.

Given the benefit of hindsight, Ken Starr's role as \\"independent\\" counsel is seeming less like bad luck, and more like the first salvo in a struggle to restructure the American political system without the inconvenience of holding elections.<br /><br />James Carville uses his Cajun wit and straight talk to get to the heart of who Ken Starr really is. Written in 1998, \\"And the Horse He Rode In On\\" uncovers Starr's alliances with far-right Republican operatives. The book also shows up Starr's $40 million Whitewater \\"investigation\\" for what it was: a politically-motivated fishing expedition to bring down President Bill Clinton. That the Republican right came within a whisker of succeeding, ignoring the \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" impeachment standard of the Constitution, should scare the crud out of any American patriot -- right, left or middle.<br /><br />It should shock all Americans that Starr's work uncovered nothing. Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate and Troopergate turned up no illegal behavior on the part of the Clintons, but gave Starr and his fellow travelers plenty of chances for smear and innuendo. Carville chronicles the way Starr leaked information in order to coerce witnesses to testify. Carville also follows the incredible system of payoffs that kept Whitewater alive far beyond its natural life.<br /><br />Keep this book around to remind you of what happens when biased political dogs are let loose against duly elected officials.	2004-11-30

Her views are deeply heartfelt and intelligent, and touch the ground of truth behind the poses that many of us find (and often display) in public life. When Vowell cringes at the thought of her Montana family visiting her in NYC, you cringe with her; when she weeps at the Inauguration of George W. Bush, you want to comfort her; when she is appalled by media distortions of the truth, you want to rail with her.<br /><br />The essays in \\"The Partly Cloudy Patriot\\" capture the complexity of loving America when you know too much history to be completely at home with the country's squeaky-clean mythos. Vowell interviews students who were there when Al Gore never claimed to have discovered Love Canal; actually, he was preaching convincingly about the power of a single student to raise issues of national importance. Vowell talks about the tacky elegance of a cafeteria deep in Carlsbad Caverns and the silliness of tour guides who attempt, post hoc, to elevate the status of slaves by calling them \\"Africans in bondage.\\" Her tender, piercing worldview salves as much as skewers, letting her express ideas that cut across the grain of commonly-accepted attitudes.<br /><br />The book's title refers to a Thomas Paine essay from the American revolution that complains about the \\"sunshine patriots\\" who disappear when the days grow short and the fight turns against them. She portrays herself in halfway measures as only slightly better than these -- as a \\"partly cloudy\\" patriot. But I am not fooled. Anyone who can speaks so lovingly and without irony about Teddy Roosevelt's North Dakota cabin and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is far more a patriot than that. Sarah Vowell would hate to hear it, but when it comes loving what is most fundamental about America, she is true blue.	2004-11-22

In the first three sentences of this inane rant masquerading as a book, Ann Coulter implies that liberals live off their parents, don't pay taxes and are close to the \\"Arab Street.\\" By page 3, she is already deep into \\"radical conservative projection mode,\\" claiming that liberals \\"can only win arguments when no one is allowed to argue back.\\" For anyone even peripherally acquainted with the bullying and airway restrictions of O'Reilly, Hannity, Limbaugh and Savage (as opposed to the respectful and broad dialog in places like PBS and NPR) this charge is ridiculous.<br /><br />Coulter repeats her standard lies that Clinton repeatedly \\"did nothing\\" to stop terrorism. I guess Cruise missile attacks on bin Laden (before the public had heard of him) and successful prosecutions of terrorists count as \\"nothing\\" in her universe. On the other hand, it wasn't the fault of Coulter hero Ronald Reagan that he cut and run from Beirut after the bombing deaths of over 200 Marines. Poor thing, he \\"caved in\\" as a result of a Democratic \\"hissy fit.\\" Wow. Some hero.<br /><br />The rest of this slightly interesting book is a compilation of Coulter articles, followed by responses from various TV pundits and one-sidely vitriolic correspondence with reporters looking for clarification about some of her outrageous statements. While this makes for riveting (if stomach-churning) reading, it exposes Coulter as a screamer who twists the clear intent of her original columns in order to portray her detractors as liars and fools.<br /><br />I didn't come close to finishing this book. I don't see how people can read it, unless they are desperately in need of stimulation in their lives, in which case I recommend light snaps of a rubber band to the wrist.

The models are evaluated on their basis in Scripture, their link to Catholic traditional teaching (including Vatican II) and their resonance with the modern world.

You don't have to be homophilic to recognize the enormous impact of homosexuals on American culture. Homosexuals, especially gay men, are deeply embedded in almost every element of our culture, including theater, movies, music, television, haute couture, food preparation, floristry and hair styling. Cathy Crimmins' thesis is that gay sensibility has long been at the root of much that heterosexuals take for granted in American culture.<br /><br />\\"How the Homosexuals Saved Civilization\\" is no scholarly treatise, but a light and breezy overview of the seeming omnipresence of gays in American cultural life. Crimmins chronicles her own childhood awakening to the existence of gay elements in culture, explaining why she was attracted to the typically campy and over-the-top work of gays. She reminds us that straight America has danced, sung and fallen in love to the work of homosexuals, usually without knowing it. Cole Porter, Cary Grant, Rock Hudson, Little Richard, Johnny Mathis and Elton John are just a few of the gay artists that Crimmins names as having a deep impact on entertainment, and hence on American experience.<br /><br />Crimmins covers the \\"Liberace Effect,\\" in which gays and others deny the gayness of their work; the gay adoration of female divas like Garland, Streisand and Cher; the pre-gay-lib gay sensibility of Paul Lynde and Charles Nelson Reilly. Crimmins also describes gay influence on more recent media creations like \\"Sex and the City,\\" in which gay writers put their own boy-to-boy frank conversations into the mouths of heterosexual women. Even shows like John Stewart's \\"The Daily Show\\" flaunt their edginess with references to gay culture and preoccupations. Crimmins also shows how certain trends (earrings and disco, flaunting or shaving of body hair, etc.) originate in the gay or black worlds before moving into the straight world -- usually unbeknownst to its latest practitioners.<br /><br />While Crimmins celebrates the glitzy, campy, colorful and fabulous side of the gay life, she somewhat glosses over its downside -- AIDS, homophobia, its obsession with sexual experimentation and its not infrequent shallowness and nastiness. While some people are instinctively attracted to gay expressiveness, others are turned off by it. In New England, straights loathed the disco era, to some degree because of its gay-born exuberance. Still, \\"How Homosexuals Saved Civilization\\" proves its thesis that gays have enormously affected and benefited American life, saving it from blandness, teaching it to love, to appreciate irony, and giving it something to sing about.<br /><br />While most of the book is in PG-13 range, the sections on gay sexuality are very frank and deserve a strong R rating.life, she somewhat glosses over its downside -- AIDS, homophobia, its obsession with sexual experimentation and its not infrequent shallowness and nastiness.

When he subsumes that angst in the service of his subject, as he did most ably in his \\"Maus\\" books, he raises his art beyond shallow self-involvement. But when he doesn't...<br /><br />\\"In the Shadow of No Towers\\" is a narcissistic reflection on Spiegelman's inner experience revolving around the World Trade Center attack in September 2001. Spiegelman is haunted (and evidently wishes us to be) by the ghostly glow of the burning towers' skeletons just before they crashed. Since he seems to be the only one to have witnessed this phenomenon, it's hard to connect with his experience.<br /><br />The end pages refer to another American crisis exactly 100 years before the WTC attacks: the assassination attempt on President McKinley in 1901. He is evidently drawing parallels between anti-anarchy panic of the early 20th century and anti-Muslim sentiments of the early 21st. Having pointed out the parallel, he drops it. The last 1/3 of the book seemingly consists of reprints of comic strips from the early 1900s. At first I thought these were clever take-offs on old strips. But they appear to be what they seemed at first - old comics page reprints. Message? Who knows?<br /><br />\\"Two Towers\\" is really a missed opportunity to either chronicle a time of fear and uncertainty or to bring the reader a greater perspective on the tragedy. We hear a lot of Spiegelman's anti-Bush rhetoric and anger about going to war with Iraq, but without much insight or irony.<br /><br />I didn't expect \\"No Towers\\" to attain the lofty standards of \\"Maus,\\" but I expected something deeper than the mere transfer of an artist's untransformed inner anxieties to paper. As a reflection on September 11, this work has surprisingly little to say.	2004-11-11

He focuses his tale on his own family's tragic history, using the strangely-appropriate medium of comic book drawing. Maus II tells the Spiegelman family story from confinement in Auschwitz to the harrowing days at the end of the war through liberation and establishment in America.<br /><br />Art is a tortured son of a tortured family. Mother and father lived through the Holocaust on their wits and good luck. Now that the war is over, they continue to live haunted lives, never free of the fear and mass murder that enveloped their youth. Art, their American artist child, just barely tolerates his father's obsessiveness and extreme miserliness. The father, while starving in Auschwitz, saved half of his morning rations for trading for shoes or clothes. Now that he is old, he continues to play every nook and cranny of the system in order to save a wooden match or to cadge a free bingo game. The sense of the man's weirdness (and his son's resulting lack of patience) is palpably sad and funny at the same time.<br /><br />Spiegelman's art is deceptively innocuous, using a black and white comic book style. His tale alternates between the present story of his elderly, pill-counting father in the present and the past story of ghettos, cruelty and death camps. Spiegelman draws his humans with animals heads -- an ingenious way to portray ethnic and cultural differences that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. Jews are rendered as mouse-headed humans, Poles with pig heads and Nazis topped with heads of predacious cats.<br /><br />Spiegelman's tale is part history, part expiation of guilt for resenting a brother killed during the war and part rage at a family member's suicide. The war never ended for those who endured it, and ripples through time to damage the next generations. That's pretty heavy for a comic book, but Art Spiegelman pulls it off brilliantly.	2004-11-05

Author Rebecca Wells is an exceptional reader who brings life and warmth to the quirky characters she created. Guy that I am, I could still appreciate the mythic female element that wound its way through the book, from the Holy Lady of the first chapters to womb-like water towers to the jungle character at the end. And throughout, mother Vivi Walker and her band of Ya-Yas, human embodiment of all that is good, strong and also frail about women. Wells's characters are strong and elemental without being mere caricatures of Southern female weirdness -- a major problem with the movie made from this book. A feminine presence permeates the book, whose characters struggle together and alone to remain grounded in its nourishing embrace.<br /><br />Ya-ya Sisterhood gave me a sense of what many women long for and seldom find in this world -- a strong, enfolding, mothering presence that affirms their femininity in all its guises, simultaneously sensuous and sacred. What a book!	2004-11-04

The humor is edgy and right-on, with innumerable ironic references to American history and politics. For instance, if you don't know Sally Hemmings' relationship with Thomas Jefferson, then Jefferson's foreword won't make much sense. George Washington's \\"threats\\" to keep John Adams off American currency is absurdist humor at its best.<br /><br />\\"America\\" is set up like a modern high school history book, replete with colorful visuals, call-outs in the margins and \\"expert\\" interviews, in this case from the Daily Show cast. While much of the book is dead-on satire, it does suffer (like the show) from a stronger-than-necessary dose of vulgarity, making it a PG-13 (if not an R-rated) experience. While references to auto-erotic asphyxiation and S&M gear might go over the heads of most teens, the copious use of profanity and the occasional nude photo won't.<br /><br />With that caveat in mind, Stewart's book is a fun-filled (even educational!) romp through the vicissitudes of our political system. As with all true satire, the humor conceals a heart overflowing with a desire for the redemption of its target. Someday, the left will be able to express its love of country without such reserve. Until then, \\"America\\" will have to do!	2004-11-03

It describes how difficult it was for far right messages to get into the media marketplace in the 1950s and 1960s, and the environment of journalistic rigor and standards (not leftist bias) that kept out these and other loony ideas. Brock's books also describes the changing environment toward the end of the 20th century that allowed previously-outr&eacute; (French for \\"wacked\\") ideas and their purveyors to flood the media. We now seem to be, I hope, at the end of the pendulum's swing, in a world where ideas that were considered radical are now treated as respectable and worthy of a serious hearing.<br /><br />OK. That's the first 3/4 of the book. Lots of names and dates, not much narrative, and few spicy anecdotes.<br /><br />The last 1/4 of the book gets a bit juicier as Brock tells us about the rise of the recent right-wing pundits. He covers Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Bill O'Reilley, John Stossel, the various denizens Fox News and others. Unfortunately, much of his material is old news to any who have read earlier books by Al Franken (\\"Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them\\") or Eric Alterman (\\"What Liberal Media?\\"). Truth be told, Franken and Alterman are much more interesting.<br /><br />Bottom line: Brock's book ably documents our media's evolution from journalism-school sobriety to its current state of being overrun by right-wing ideologues and their radical ideas. The book does less well in describing why these ideas are wrong, why they are so attractive and what can be done to return the media to a semblance of decency, professionalism and balance.	2004-11-02

GA is of a piece with the rest of the series. The writing is episodic, action-packed and gore-soaked, interspersed with sermonettes and a heavy dose of literal fulfillments of scriptural prophesy. There are good guys who are very, very good, and bad guys who really are evil incarnate.<br /><br />As a work of fiction, though, GA lacks drama. Like little kids playing cops-and-robbers, the good guys have inexhaustible supplies of ammo; their vehicles never run out of gas; they are completely invulnerable to their enemies' weapons. The protagonists spend most of the book chatting with each other by cell phone and computers, as though electronic networks survived world-wide devastation due to earthquakes and 100-pound hail. Events that are not televised are personally witnessed. Moles and infiltrators are never caught or even suspected. GA's characters are unidimensional, never varying from their paper-thin personalities even when critically injured and near death. Evil characters are comically small and buffoonish; Lucifer is little more than a six-foot tall being of light; the Antichrist and his prophet are ludicrous and unimpressive. For all of its religious trappings, GA also seems positively unchristian: the heroes childishly sneer and gesture at the hordes of human beings who are soon to be damned to eternal torment. They show no compassion to any but their own kind, as though the teaching to \\"love your enemies\\" expired with the apocalypse. Even then, they barely grieve the gruesome deaths of loved ones. Hey, I believe in heaven too, but I would weep if my son-in-law died. GA is also lazy: its Jesus does little more than spout a string of scriptural verses lifted straight out of the Bible. Who thought the Word of God would plagiarize himself so unapologetically?<br /><br />Grouchiness aside, I must say that I *did* bother to pick up the book. There's something fascinating about the subject, whose outsized concepts and personages have given artists great and small the chance to stretch their imaginations. GA delivers meteorites the size of tabletops, 30-foot geysers of blue flame, sky-high crosses made of lightning bolts, and chin-deep rivers of blood. Perversely, GA also delivers a world in which the authors wallow in the sure belief that the billions of people who are unlike them will roast forever in the furnaces of Hell while they hosanna eternally with the celestial chorus. From the pen of Dante, such exercises are \\"divine\\" indeed; from the pens of LaHaye and Jenkins, they are dreary exercises in self-congratulation.I must say that I *did* bother to pick up the book.

Dowd, Bill Clinton's impeachment-era attack dog, now hones her razor-sharp quill to slash at the Bush II administration. As the book progresses, you can almost hear the creaks and groans of a mind stretching in the face of real political peril.<br /><br />Starting early in his presidency, even earlier in some cases, Dowd nailed Bush's shallowness, his lack of global awareness (calling the citizens of Greece \\"Grecians\\"), his secretive streak, his schemes to reward his corporate pals and his cloaking of citizen-unfriendly policies in moral garb. Her satirical pieces are dead-on. Two stand out: one where Cheney and Rummy luxuriate in the White House hot tub while \\"Junior\\" races around like a six month old puppy off his leash; another being a chummy Cheney letter (with strategic black outs) to Prince XXXXXX bin XXXX, telling him not to worry about the FBI pinning 9/11 on his oil rich country of XXXXX XXXXXX.<br /><br />For all its present-day right-on rightness, I found it hard to forgive Dowd's vicious attacks on Clinton. Her 1999 Pulitzer was for her biting attacks that kept the Lewisnsky \\"scandal\\" alive, much to the delight of Clinton's detractors. Unwittingly (I'd like to believe) she helped create the atmosphere that brought the current administation, which she evidently loathes and fears, into power. George W's pet name for Dowd -- \\"The Cobra\\" -- fits her all too well. Perhaps in the future she will be more selective about spreading her venom, realizing that politics is more than a game of clever sarcasm, sparkling satire and journalistic prizes. It is about the lives, security and hopes of a quarter of a billion citizens who depend on it functioning properly.	2004-10-14

Szpilman is a classical pianist whose middle-class, affluent Jewishness is not much of a liability until the Nazis arrive. From that point on, he and his family endure the slow tightening of the Nazi noose -- yellow armbands and petty restrictions -- leading up to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto and the deportation of his family to the death camps.<br /><br />\\"The Pianist\\" serves up a hellish brew of bizarre images that if they were not witnessed, would not be believed. The Polish partisan shot in the back and slumping to her knees in the street; the communion-like division of a tiny dime-candy among 6 doomed people; the Bizarre Waltz forced by bored Nazi guards on Jews waiting to cross a barred street; the young lad beaten to death trying to crawl through a storm drain; starving elderly Jewish workers fighting over a pot of beans. These are powerful images that convince because of their relative insignificance. The Holocaust and resistance were a compendium of such small yet telling moments of horror.<br /><br />The book ends with a short biography of German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, the man who fed Szpliman as the war was winding down. Hosenfeld's basic humanity was in counterpoint the senseless viloence and butchery of so many other German soldiers during the war. His kindness is especially poignant becuuse of his own suffereings after the war.The Pianist brings to the screen the memories of a man who survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war -- the liquidation of the ghetto and the Warsaw uprising. It's a testament to the thousands and millions who played their small parts in a gigantic drama that shaped the last century.<br /><br />\\"The Pianist\\" is a fine companion to the Oscar-winning movie of the same name, bringing to life many of the book's indelible images.	2004-10-12

First, I had no idea that there was still so much original material for a historian to work with. Second, I didn't realize how much could be gleaned from reading  between the lines of these precious documents. Tuchman delves beneath and behind the recorded words to shine a light on the truth of living in that calamitous time. It was a century in which the Black Death and the Hundred Years' War combined to demoralize and radicalize a weakened populace. It was a century in which the pillars of society, both secular and religious, seemed lethally pervaded with corruption and incompetence. It was a time of peasant revolts that prefigured the popular revolutions of the 18th century and a time when the Church's utter lack of spirituality set the stage for the 16th century reformers. Yet it was also a century of crusading heroes and prophetic witnesses, in which national identities were solidifying.<br /><br />Tuchman focuses on a single figure, previously unknown to me, who found himself at many of the critical events of the century. Le Sire de Coucy, thoroughly a man of his time, exemplified the great strengths of his day and (to a lesser extent) its weaknesses. Proud, noble, courageous, discreet and intelligent, Coucy is the epitome of the knight in shining armor, in a time when the virtues of that calling were more sung about than lived. I came away from \\"A Distant Mirror\\" with a great admiration for this previously anonymous \\"chevalier.\\"<br /><br />Tuchman calls the 14th century a mirror of the troubled 20th century. The parallels were less clear to me, and this is the sole weakness of the book. We will have to see whether the calamaties of the 20th century (genocidal world wars, global economic disruptions, decolonialism) will set the stage for a wholesale power shift on the part of present-day society.<br /><br />That said, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a sparkling jewel of the popular historian's art, bringing to life a time and place that are otherwise known only through myth and romance.t said, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a sparkling jewel of the popular historian's art, bringing to life a time and place that are otherwise known only through myth and romance.	2004-10-11

Better yet, he spotlights devices that *do* work well, effortlessly engaging our intuitive sense of the way things ought to behave. Along the way, we learn a great deal about the way our minds unconsciously read cues gathered from objects, impelling us to interact with them in certain ways. A flat plate on a door, for instance, sends the message, \\"push me.\\" A raised handle on a door insists, \\"grab me and pull!\\" Yet how many doors meant for pushing are fitted with raised handles? After reading this book, you will never look at a door, or a computer screen, or a even a car radio the same way. And you will never again take for granted the gifted designers and interface engineers who allow us to use their products without effort.<br /><br />The driest parts of the book are those where Norman delves into psychological basis for his observations.

I am at least as critical of its faults as the next person, but this was a book, purporting to pinpoint the Church's fundamental fault, that I just could not bring myself to like.<br /><br />In \\"The Unhealed Wound,\\" Eugene Kennedy has written a tiresomely repetitive book in which he lays all the faults of the Catholic Church on its \\"unhealed wound\\" concerning human sexuality. Kennedy discerns this wound in the Percival legend (he of the genital wound that would not heal) through the tragic story of Heloise and Abelard and into our day of pedophilic priests. The Church, as Kennedy sees it, pits Flesh against Spirit, forcing human beings to split themselves so that their heaven-tending souls may subdue their sin-prone flesh.<br /><br />It's not a bad premise, except that it doesn't fully align with the Church's positive teachings about sexuality and embodiment. The Church has taught from the beginning (as in the Resurrection of Christ) that we are not souls trapped in disposable bodies, but are unified beings - embodied spirits. If the anthropology of a body-soul split has more than its share of representatives, its because the Church fails to counter this mistaken view, not because the Church embraces it.<br /><br />Kennedy makes much of the existence of celibacy being a sign and symptom of the unhealed wound. But celibacy does not have to be read as life-denying, as legions of priests and saints throughout the ages can testify. The most fruitful celibate life is not accomplished by denying sexuality, but by using its power and drive for purposes other than \\"mere\\" genitality. True, some Catholics over the centuries have demonized bodiliness and feared sex. But those outlooks have not prevailed. Anyway, the recent abuses in Boston (as well as elsewhere) have nothing to do with poor, desexed priests trying to heal their sexual wounds. It's about an institution that saw itself above and apart from the rest of sinful creation, refused to police itself, and used its power to hide the criminals in its midst.<br /><br />I am sympathetic to writers who wish to shed light on the problems of the Church -- if only to help us to right the Barque of Peter.

He is not beholden to the political world for his job, and so can write what he thinks, rather than echo the lies his keepers want to hear. His independent, common-sensical voice is just what we need in this era of right-wing echo chambers and extreme partisanship.<br /><br />\\"The Great Unraveling\\" is a frightening title for a book, since Krugman wishes to warn against the unraveling of our very political and economic institutions. Krugman tries to see beyond the rhetoric of the radical right to discern its designs and purposes. What he sees is not pretty. Comparing the Bush II Administration to the radicals of post-Revolutionary France, Krugman shows how Bush and Co. are not playing by the rules that constrained other administrations. Revolutionaries, while they may engage the moderate sectors of society, are not constrained by the worldview of the majority. Moderates, unable to believe that the radicals really mean what they say, allow their society to be compromised until it falls.<br /><br />Krugman goes light on economic theory to describe a modern America in which greed is increasingly becoming a civic virtue. His description of the recent power \\"shortage\\" in California is a case in point. Deregulation allowed speculators to pull power stations offline, manufacturing a shortage that speculators then utilized for selling more expensive electricity from out of state. The dismantling of normal constraints, long demonized as \\"excessive government regulation,\\" allowed the general public to be robbed.<br /><br />Krugman sees the desire to get rich by manipulating markets and government as the main thrust behind recent Republican efforts to privatize Social Security, dismantle environmental regulations and spread crony capitalism. While the radicals bully the public into accepting their agenda as \\"good for America\\", their intentions are simply to rob the nation blind, wrecking lives in the process. The war in Iraq is a perfect distraction, keeping Americans from focusing on how their economic protections are being stripped and their pockets are being picked.<br /><br />Krugman compares the Bush II team unfavorably with the Clinton team that brought this country job-growth and a vibrant economy. The fiscal disciplinarians who were a hallmark of Clinton's two terms have been replaced by fiscal wolves-in-lamb's-clothing who are busy running up deficits, benefiting their own kind and demolishing a century's worth of economic protections.<br /><br />\\"The Great Dismantling\\" is another in a series of dispiriting books whose Cassandra-like warnings are being shouted to a so-far unresponsive citizenry. The book is sane, well thought out and simple to understand. It's anyone's guess whether Americans will takes Krugman's warnings seriously while there is still a chance to affect the outcome.war in Iraq is a perfect distraction, keeping Americans from focusing on how their economic protections are being stripped and their pockets are being picked.

Part diary, part reflection and part polemic, it allowed me to participate vicariously in the confusion, rage and activism of Columbia's student strikes of the late 1960s.<br /><br />Kunen was the kind of kid I wanted to be. A nerdy kind of a guy, he participated in anti-establishment student actions at Columbia University. He protested construction projects that supposedly disenfranchised Columbia's neighbors and helped occupy the offices of college officials. He was an activist, though on the fringes, \\"stickin' it to the man\\" before the phrase became widely known. Kunen was the poster child for my teen rage against a governmental machine that had my parents' blind support. His writing is genuine and funny, capturing the hydra-headed angst of being a long-haired college kid in 1968. No wonder I liked the book!<br /><br />Kunen's description of student organizers like Mark Rudd nailed (albeit unconsciously) the leaders of the period as typical politicians, who carefully managed the mob's righteous indignation with their own positioning for future leadership roles. Kunen's description of university officials poignantly captured their vapidity and their befuddlement at being questioned by their under-age charges. The book is a perfectly-posed snapshot of a culture teetering between a passive age of obedient complacency and an emerging age of anti-authoritarian mistrust and challenge.<br /><br />Thirty years later, I also see some of the narcissistic silliness that defined the 1960s. The war in Vietnam, which presumably fueled protests, is strangely absent from Kunen's writings, giving his musings a tinge of empty-headedness rather than profundity. Marxism, which appealed to a generation of college radicals, seems worn more as a badge of distinctiveness from his parent's unreflective capitalism rather than a lived reality. For all his desire to be different, Kunen is depressingly the same as many post-adolescents, crossing swords with adults who don't take him seriously, missing the big picture while fighting the good fight.<br /><br />As a way for adolescents to get in touch with their desire for activism, \\"The Strawberry Statement\\" is a gem. As a snapshot of being 19 years old in late 1960s - with its half-blind groping toward an unseen and hopefully brighter future-it is priceless.l his desire to be different, Kunen is depressingly the same as many post-adolescents, crossing swords with adults who don't take him seriously, missing the big picture while fighting the good fight. <br /> <br />As a way for adolescents to get in touch with their desire for activism, \\"The Strawberry Statement\\" is a gem.

Author James Carroll traces Christianity's tension and hostility toward Judaism throughout the ages, starting with the anti-Jewish tone of the Gospels, and continuing through the Holocaust and beyond. This book is depressing, partly because of the innumerable instances of Jew-hatred through 2000 years of Western history, and partly due to Carroll's humorless and gloomy writing style.<br /><br />There are benefits to reading this book, whether one likes Carroll or not. Christians needs always to remember the suffering that has been caused in the name of Christ, from pogroms, to ghettos to blood libels. It's good to recall that Christianity is rooted in the experience of a sect that had not worked out its relationship to Judaism. It's helpful also to reflect on modern assumptions about, for instance, the seemingly anti-Judaistic writings of Paul. We Christians should also witness ways that our coreligionists have been so insistent on seeing every Christian advance as a defeat for the Jews. The legend of St. Helen's finding of the True Cross, for instance, is sullied by alleging the unhappiness of Jews at the discovery.<br /><br />On the negative side, Carroll rarely cuts Christianity any slack. Every Christian and every Christian act seems subtly yet undeniably tied up with hatred of Jews. Every attempt of the Church to reverse or limit anti-semitism is questioned or minimized. \\"Nostra Aetate,\\" the landmark Church document repudiating Jew hatred and the abominable charge of deicide, does not go far enough, in Carroll's telling, since it does not dismantle the supposed antisemitism present in the Gospels themselves. Historical figures are judged only on their anti-Jewish actions. Pope Pius XII is not my favorite pope, but there's more to his pontificate than his alleged lack of action toward the Jews. It sometimes seems that Carroll would be satisfied only by a wholesale dismantling of Christianity, scouring the faith to its supposed bedrock, assuming that it would then be purged of blood guilt toward the Jews. Such a scenario is as naïve as it is unlikely.<br /><br />Carroll has done a great service by uncovering heretofore unknown aspects of the Christian story. However, by lashing Christianity so firmly to the stake of anti-semitism, he overlooks the fact that peoples grow and change, and that forgiveness and reconciliation are possible -- even between oppressors and their victims.ty, scouring the faith to its supposed bedrock, assuming that it would then be purged of blood guilt toward the Jews.

A man whose recent memory is obliterated every five minutes. A man who ceases to recognize objects in their completeness -- faces, gloves, his wife -- but knows them only by adding up the sum of their parts. A man who no longer sees his leg as part of his own body, and is found on the floor after throwing this \\"foreign\\" object out of bed. Oliver Sacks uses each of these stories to illustrate the way our brains operate by means of studying those who have lost mental functioning due to accident or disease.<br /><br />Sacks' stories are often poignant, and are portraits not only of the abstract workings of the mind, but of the people who must bear these disabilities. What is it like to live as a person whose last remembered self image is decades old? What happens when he looks into a mirror and sees himself as a wrinkled grayhair? Can such a person, with no ability to see life as a developing continuity, be said to have a soul? Does nature provide compensations? Or is life an existential nightmare ended only by merciful death?<br /><br />Sacks has a gift for making extraordinary internal realities accessible to the non-technician. His deep humanity and compassion, evident on every page, help the reader share and care for individuals with deficits I pray never to experience.	2004-09-23

Its title seemed to indicate a tongue-in-cheek approach to history's gaffes and goofs, in the vein of \\"The Darwin Awards\\". Instead, the reader was often treated to rather ordinary recititations of history. The tale of Watergate was told in a straightforward style without entertainment value. The barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire were a dull, unfunny and undetailed summary (in only 7 pages !) of 400 years of Roman history. Other stories held my interest better, not due to the writing but because of the unfamiliar subject matter. The story of Ferdinand de Lesseps' first attempt to build the Panama Canal was an example. But even this tale, which tried to poke fun at de Lesseps' folly, just wasn't funny.<br /><br />The book, subtitled \\"Mad Plans and Great Historical Disasters,\\" is less about the folly of human beings than about the unexpected (but not mad) turns that human activities take. Who knew ahead of time that aspirin would have value while heroin would become a social scourge?<br /><br />I'll say this for the book: as annoying as it was, I kept coming back to it until I finished it. That's worth 3 stars.	2004-09-23

The book, a compilation of short essays from Mother Jones, The Fort Worth Star-telegram and other sources, covers the tail end of Bush I's presidency in 1992 and the birth of the Clinton administration. Along the way she also chronicles the daffy dealings with the Texas \\"Lege,\\" mostly skewering her state's \\"wiggy\\" Republican representatives. These worthies never saw a school improvement or gun-limitation bill they couldn't oppose. I often wondered how soft-hearted Ivins gets out of bed in the morning to cover the incredible array of lunkheads, nitwits and pea-brains that inhabit the hallowed halls of government.<br /><br />Ivins is at her best when she plays the head-shaking good ol' girl. But beneath the pose is a patriotic and populist heart that bleeds for the destitute and abandoned who are either ignored or manipulated by politicians seeking their own aims. Ivins's Fourth of July pieces are true-blue, inspiring paeans to the goodness of ordinary Americans, the awesomeness of the Constitution and the baseness of politicians who disregard it.<br /><br />No matter how many times I read Ivins' work, I still marvel at her artful artlessness, her compassionate intelligence and (especially) her ardor for the common person and the common good.

That the author is a long-standing, respected Unites States Senator, adds the sound of the siren as well.<br /><br />Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) has served in Congress for over 50 years, in the Senate since 1958, and since 1959 as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He has written the unthinkable -- a non-fictional Cassandra of a book about what he fears is the imminent unraveling of the American constitutional system. Byrd's book is another in a lengthening string of books by present and former government officials detailing the abuses and ineptitudes of the current administration. Hardly the ravings of a rabid anarchist, \\"Losing America\\" is the sober, considered thought of a wise and intelligent man whose appreciation for our government's institutions is deep and abiding. Byrd recounts in sickening detail the attacks on the checks and balances of the US Constitution, attacks that have become a hallmark of the Bush II presidency. Detailing Bush's excessive and unnecessary secrecy, his repeated stonewalling of legitimate congressional requests for information and his attempts to usurp the control over congressional \\"power of the purse,\\" Byrd makes an effective and frightening case that Bush II's policies are undermining the Constitution's protections against tyranny.<br /><br />I found Byrd's insertion of autobiographical material fascinating, perhaps a tiny bit self-serving. Byrd tells us about being strong-armed by Lyndon Johnson, about insisting on the red carpet treatment from the Soviets and about visiting Iran just prior to the taking of the hostages in 1978. Byrd's stories often relate his efforts to retain his senatorial prerogatives, not (says he) out of a sense personal entitlement, but in the service of Legislative Branch parity with the Executive Branch. Self-serving or not, Byrd's actions bring home the point that the American system is built on tensions between the three branches of government.<br /><br />\\"Losing America\\" is many things -- autobiography, primer on the US Constitution, exposition of the roots of the American system of government and anti-Bush polemic. Byrd's recounting of the steady erosion of respect for Congress ought to be truly alarming to those who believe in government of, for and by the people. His disgust with and distrust of George W. Bush's administration is palpable on every page. The litany of Bush's rejection of bills to adequately fund homeland security after 9/11 makes Byrd (and the reader) wonder what the President's intentions really are. One can only hope that with an author who is such a highly-respected member of the Senate, \\"losing America\\" will prompt readers to reconsider their attraction to the present occupants of the White House and those who share their vision.hat the American system is built on tensions between the three branches of government.  <br /> <br />\\"Losing America\\" is many things -- autobiography, primer on the US Constitution, exposition of the roots of the American system of government and anti-Bush polemic.

Nigel Hamilton's minutely-detailed \\"JFK: Reckless Youth,\\" which recounts Kennedy's early through his first run for Congress, is one helluva place to start.<br /><br />The myth of Camelot has suffered death by a thousand cuts -- shredded by the disclosure of presidential affairs, murder plots and political machinations. But while other celebrities have generated renewed interest and sympathy by openly airing dirt and scandal, the Kennedys have endlessly recycled the Camelot myth of the heroic young president slain before his time. Hamilton's book is the antidote to this pious tripe, serving up a John Kennedy fighting against (and sometimes embracing) forces that should have destroyed him. Young John Kennedy suffered from a mystery ailment that landed him in the hospital countless times. He courted disaster and scandal with a string of amours. He chose to fight the Japanese on a \\"plywood coffin\\" known as a PT boat rather than sit out the war in a safer place. He was saddled with a father whose pre-WWII appeasement policies undercut the national interest. Kennedy, from a young age, was one familiar with the knife's edge between life and death, learning to skate the blade with grace and aplomb. Hamilton exhaustively chronicles these episodes using interview material and an extraordinary trove of personal letters to and from Kennedy himself.<br /><br />It's a shame that the Kennedy family blocked Hamilton's access to additional JFK material. The next volumes would no doubt have shown the moral excesses and almost suicidal risk-taking increasing as JFK grew older. While this material might have threatened the maudlin serenity of Camelot, I would have welcomed the change. Paradoxically, my love and admiration for John Kennedy did not wane as I read the incredible details of his life. Instead, I was amazed that such an extraordinary, compassionate and visionary man arose from the chaos of a life lived as a constant roll of the dice.compassionate and visionary man arose from the chaos of a life lived as a constant roll of the dice.	2004-09-16

The view that Paul (and God!) turned against his own people had been considered self-evident to a long line of scholars and theologians stretching back at least to St. Augustine. But the history of the 20th century, soaked copiously with the blood of innocent Jews, made many New Testament scholars hope that a less Jew-hating Paul could be salvaged from Paul's writing.<br /><br />Gager reviews the roots of traditional view of Paul -- the \\"obvious\\" view discerned by the casual modern reader of the New Testament. Saul/Paul in this view is an observant Jew who is converted to Christianity by a miraculous experience of the Risen Christ, and who then proceeds to condemn his own people based on their \\"rejection\\" of Jesus as the promised Messiah. Gager re-examines this view in the light of new scholarship and new attitudes since the Shoah. How can Paul, he asks, \\"convert\\" to a faith that does not yet exist? Paul's conversion is an event that is \\"read back\\" into his story based on the post-70 CE split of Judaism and Christianity. Paul, whose Damascus Road experience dates to the years immediately following Christ's crucifixion in 30 CE, would not have thought of his experience as a conversion *from* Judaism, but at most from one expression of Judaism to another.<br /><br />But what of Paul's seeming citations against Jews and Judaism? Gager's thesis is that Paul's enemies were not Christ-denying Jews, but Christ-*affirming* Jews within the Jesus movement. To Paul, these Jewish-born Christians misunderstood the meaning of Christ's death, which to Paul was the way that God extended salvation from the Jews to the Gentiles. Read in this light, a citation like \\"The Jew has no advantage and circumcision is of no value\\" (Romans 3:1) does not signal God's rejection of Jews, but that Gentiles need not become Jews to gain salvation.<br /><br />Gager's thesis is sound and based on a sensible reading of the New Testament. However, Gager works too hard to show how much better his thesis is than that of his predecessors. The book is also much too long, repeating the same points ad nauseum. In spite of these faults, I found \\"Reinventing Paul\\" to be a valuable contribution that makes Paul's thinking not only tolerable but even laudatory.ecome Jews to gain salvation. <br /> <br />Gager's thesis is sound and based on a sensible reading of the New Testament.

Maher's book is deliberately intended to parallel the calls to sacrifice and resolve that were evident during World War II. Artists have has reworked famous WWII posters and slogans (\\"Loose Lips Sink Ships,\\" \\"I Want YOU!\\" and the title poster that substitutes Osama for Hitler) to give the war on terror the same significance and urgency that citizens were urged to feel when faced with fascist aggression.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many of the issues that Maher raised are still relevant today, 3 years after the the September 2001 terror attacks. Americans have not been asked to sacrifice. Other than a few thousand soldiers killed or wounded, most Americans continue in the same habits of mind and body that feed the terror networks. We know little about the culture of the Islamic world. We still buy oil-guzzling SUVs and we still burn electricity with reckless abandon, regardless of how these habits indirectly help finance oil-producing nations, which (in case one isn't aware of it) bred the fanatics who attacked us. We are still satisfied with slogans and posturing (placing flag decals on our cars rather than voting) that have no effect on our preparedness.<br /><br />It's frightening how Maher's snapshot of our national security has hardly changed in 3 years. Security at our airports, ports and borders is still dangerously porous. Other than pre-emption, our leaders have offered no new vision of independence from our enemies. We greedily accept tax breaks rather than beefing up the emergency services that saved us on September 11. Not that I am on board with all of Maher's thought. He comes across as anti-religious, though his real problem (rightly enough) is that a literal reading of scriptures (anyone's scriptures!) is dangerous. He also seems a bit too fond of racial and ethnic profiling to protect us from terrorists. (If we stop frisking grandmothers at airports, won't terrorist just dress as grandmas?)<br /><br />The book's subtitle, \\"What the Government SHOULD Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism\\" is still apt in late 2004.

He largely ignores great battles, noble speeches, landmark legislation and elections. Instead he shines light on the masses, the mob, the worker and the horde, and I mean that in the most complimentary way.<br /><br />From beginning to end, Zinn refuses to sugarcoat. He gives the greatest possible benefit to the weak and powerless, while putting the powerful in the worst light. The discovery of America is told by discussing the curiosity of the native people toward Columbus, and the brutality with which he returned their gentleness. The era of slavery is covered by telling of white panic in the face of slave resistance and revolts. The building of railroads becomes the tale of Chinese immigrants who were expendable to their white overseers. Zinn demolishes longstanding notions - that blacks were passive in the face of slaveholders; that Americans during World War II were monolithic in their support for the war effort; that historical progress is inevitable. American history for Zinn is the grim forward match of the dispossessed, the poor, the oppressed and abused. Great political events seem less the gracious gifts of beneficent rulers than the reluctant recognition of the \\"facts on the ground\\" by a laggard political system.<br /><br />Sometimes, Zinn seems to go too far with his approach. Finding dissenters to America's war effort during the 1940s certainly took some doing. Sometimes Zinn spends too much time on a particular subject. The chapters about the labor movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, for instance were long-winded and dreary.<br /><br />Whatever his politics, \\"A People's History\\" does an admirable job of filling the gaps left in other histories, by bringing into focus the experience of ordinary American men, women and children.

The journey, made when America's image was still being created, showed early 19th-century America at its best -- deploying the scientific legacy of Enlightenment and the potential for a respectful exploration of the lands and peoples of the American interior.<br /><br />Stephen Ambrose restrains his sometimes-annoying habit of celebrating every American exploit and trains his sights on an event that captures the imagination of Americans and others fully two centuries later. As with other epic journeys in real life, the Lewis and Clark expedition was a team effort requiring the talents of many. From the inspiration granted by President Jefferson, to the organizational and scientific skills of Lewis and Clark, to the language and negotiation skills of Sacagawea, to the efforts, strength and resilience of the 40-some-odd others in the \\"Corps of Discovery,\\" the expedition relied on the bravery, endurance and intellect of all.<br /><br />The modern idea of \\"roughing it\\" involves driving an RV over an interstate highway into a pre-constructed campsite with electricity, running water and waste services. The Corps of Discovery schlepped a 55-foot boat and tons of supplies by hand up uncharted rivers, across plains cloudy with misery-inducing mosquitoes and among possibly-hostile natives. Losing only a single man, Lewis and Clark managed to reach the Pacific, map the interior of the continent and return with a wealth of information about the inhabitants of the land -- human, floral and faunal. Ambrose's description of the supplies that L&C took along (including plenty of poisonous mercury pills to combat the team's anticipated venereal excesses) were hilariously instructive. What would *you* bring on a 3-year voyage to chart an unknown and probably dangerous land?<br /><br />Ambrose is at his best in this book, describing the courage and adaptability of Lewis and Clark without shying away from the trip's disappointments. From the point of view of the participants, the trip was somewhat of a bust -- no easy passage to the Pacific, and a loss of some samples and notebooks. The sad fate of some of the trek's participants underlines the reality that heroism is less seen in constant nobility and perfection than in facing the rugged, unknowable slog that requires simple endurance and the will to soldier on.<br /><br />What an inspiring book!trip's disappointments.

With no axe to grind, she (theoretically) can take a dispassionate view of a topic that has claimed the passions of generations of believers and non-believers since 1858, when Bernadette Soubirous reported her visions of the Blessed Virgin. Harris chronicles the visions themselves, of course, but throws her net much wider to help the reader understand their historical and social context.<br /><br />In 1854, Pope Pius IX (whose anti-democratic bent would appall modern American Catholics) promulgated the dogma of the Immaculate Conception - which stated that the Blessed Virgin herself was conceived without the stain of Original Sin. Just four years later, Bernadette's vision revealed its identity in Bernadette's Pyrenean patois: \\"Y soy Immaculad Conceptua\\" -- virtually confirming the newly-proclaimed dogma. How this must have gratified the wing of the Church that supported the Pope - and how it must have rankled those who saw Pius IX as a retrograde disaster for the Church!<br /><br />Harris subjects Bernadette herself to close scrutiny, chronicling her family's hardscrabble existence, her father's business incompetence and the family's recent shameful residence in a cold, drafty former prison. Harris presents the Bernadette of history--asthmatic, lice-ridden, desperately poor, barely educated yet devoutly religious--whom the Virgin graced with her visible presence. In detailing Bernadette's stark, grimy reality, Harris allows us to witness the girl's no-nonsense and even gritty brand of holiness.<br /><br />Bernadette's visions are wonderfully detailed. Many will be surprised that Bernadette's vision of a playful 9-year-old differs markedly from the standard image of the Blessed Mother. Harris portrays Bernadette's poignant and fruitless attempts to prevent her countrymen from correcting the apparitions to make them conform to their impression of what the Virgin \\"really\\" looked like. It is such delightful glimpses into Bernadette's world that make the book so fascinating.<br /><br />Harris goes well beyond the Lourdes apparitions. She explains why, of all the Lourdes visionaries, only Bernadette's visions are passed along to us. She discusses how Bernadette's post-vision behavior was vital to \\"selling\\" the apparitions to the public. Harris discusses the economics and small-time politics of the region, its native patois and the confusing political/religious alliances that sought to use Lourdes to further their own causes. Along the way, Harris spotlights the emerging role of science in the 19th century, and the antipathy with which luminaries of the day (notably Emile Zola) viewed the cures and miracles of Lourdes.<br /><br />The Lourdes phenomenon teaches that holiness cannot be understood apart from the hopes and social circumstances of real life. The apparitions, bound so tightly to the language, dress and prejudices of a particular people, place and time, seem truer than if they were otherworldly and distant. The Virgin Mary, dressed in the garb of Bernadette's time, speaking her patois, connecting with her girlish heart through play, spoke to a single girl in space and time. But by doing so, she speaks with greater clarity to all people in all times.<br /><br />That the phenomenon of Lourdes can survive the scrutiny of a historian's eye is almost as miraculous as the original luminous apparition!r impression of what the Virgin \\"really\\" looked like.

In some ways, the books seems to confirm ancient stereotypes about the sexes, which makes me a bit wary. Men occasionally need to retreat to their \\"caves.\\" Women's moods oscillate for no particular reason, putting them in a \\"well.\\" Whatever the truth to these assertions, Gray's main message is that when a man understands how utterly different the female emotional experience is from his own, he might stop expecting her to react as he would, giving her the kind of love and support she *really* needs. And vice versa.<br /><br />The strength of the book lies in the strong visual images it uses to hammer home its points: the Rubber Band, the Cave, the Tornado, the Well. The section detailing the way men and women score love \\"points\\" was hilarious and eye-opening. Save the diamond necklaces fellas. You'll get as much appreciation if you take her to the movies! The book's self-help techniques were also impressive. The Love Letter, described in Chapter 11, gives women and men a safe way to express anger, sadness, fear, regret and love, and to imagine how their partner would ideally respond. The partner can be spouse, parent (past or present), self (past or present) or even the deity.<br /><br />The book's weakness is its length, repetitiveness and perhaps its lack of originality. This was especially evident in the audio version, in which charts (which might have been scanned visually in the book) had to be read in their entirety. Entire sections in the middle chapters seem to echo material from earlier in the book. Perhaps this was done deliberately to help readers grasp points by dint of sheer repetition. But there were sections in the 8-CD unabridged version that I skipped without loss of information. I'm also concerned somewhat about contentions that Gray borrowed his materials from others. But whether all ideas originate with him, I congratulate him for packaging them in a way that is understandable and helpful.<br /><br />\\"Mars/Venus\\" will expose mens' dirty little secret that we are fragile and emotional creatures. Men are fearful of many things, in Gray's on-target opinion, not least of which is rejection or lack of admiration by the woman they love. Gray also shows the logic behind the male-confounding \\"emotional\\" responses of women. Gray not only exposes the differing perspectives that men and women bring to relationships, but advises them on how to navigate the stormy seas of love. By changing the way they respond to each other, Gray hopes that men and women can get the emotional support they both crave.<br /><br />Note: At 8 CDs, the unabridged version is too long. But the abridged version is only two CDs shorter! In any case, the reader was wonderful.tion. But there were sections in the 8-CD unabridged version that I skipped without loss of information.

For the extremely pious, the idea of human meddling in the saint-making process is sacrilegious. But Woodward explores the touchy area where devoted laborers for the Church, through their human work, manage to operate hand in hand with Divinity. \\"Making Saints\\" is not an expos&eacute; of the Vatican's machinery for canonization, but it does show how the Church's current institutional needs and prejudices strongly shape the choices of the causes under consideration.<br /><br />Who will become a saint? In short, it is the person of great sanctity whose example happens to be deemed important by the reigning Pope and other high leaders of the Church. If the Church needs to highlight the sanctity of married life, it searches for married couples whose sanctity could inspire the faithful. Sometimes, this effort is comic, as the Church, trying to move forward, trips over its own past priorities. For instance, the married couple chosen by the Church as an exemplar of sanctified married life are Louis and Az&eacute;lie Martin, all of whose surviving children entered convents, and one of whom, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux, became a saint. In choosing the Martins as candidates for sainthood, the Church did not stray far from its discomfort with sex, except perhaps as a means of producing priests and nuns.<br /><br />Obvious candidates like Archbishop Oscar Romero -- whose opposition to rightwing government-sanctioned death squads in El Salvador earned him a rifle bullet in the chest -- is not likely to be considered a saint soon. His gospel-like opposition to temporal power, his siding with the poor, his martyr's death, the devotion to him by ordinary people and even indications of physical incorruption ought to make him a shoo-in for sainthood. But to the saint makers, Romero is still too \\"political\\" to be canonized or even beatified. The upper levels of the Church are still nervous about those whose activities affect the lives of masses of people, opening the Church to charges of being in league with activists, communists and other undesirables. And so Romero awaits official notice of his canonization, regardless of his actual status in the heavenly court.<br /><br />\\"Making Saints\\" is a book that opened my eyes to the truth that there are still saints among us, people whose devotion to God and neighbor is heroic, extraordinary and exemplary. The book also made it clear that the Church (probably rightly) moves very carefully when declaring sainthood for all but the most innocuous of the holy. The Church has many constituencies and cannot afford to win some while losing others. So for every John XXIII pushed forward by liberalizers, there is a Pius XII put forward by conservatives. \\"Making Saints\\" gives fascinating insights into how the ecclesiastical, scientific and political arms of the Vatican work together to determine the who, why and when of canonization and beatification--incredibly, doing the work of God in the process.zed or even beatified.

A small-time criminal and drifter, Ray nevertheless harbored a need for accomplishment. But without education, limited intellectual gifts and with a stultifying background in poverty, he never stood a chance. His one shot at money and fame as to bring down someone big, and in 1968, that someone was Martin Luther King, Jr. By the time I finished \\"Killing the Dream,\\" any doubt I harbored that Ray killed King had been shredded by Posner's meticulous investigation.<br /><br />Ray's post-assassination fantasies about being part of a shadowy conspiracy -- painstakingly chronicled by Posner -- threw the public, and even the King family tragically off track for nearly four decades. If there is any consolation it is that with \\"Killing the Dream,\\" Posner has left a neatly gift-wrapped narrative for future generations to follow, giving them insight into the mind of the killer and that of a society that still cannot believe that small men can annihilate greatness.	2004-09-03

Ah, the years wasted believing in elaborate conspiracies!<br /><br />A detailed exposition of the Kennedy assassination, \\"Case Closed\\" gives us a superbly logical and earth-based (!) version of the events of November 22, 1963. Posner so deftly demolishes conspiracy theories that one wonders how they were given credence for so long. The section detailing Jack Ruby's movements in the hour before he shot Oswald - phoning friends, wiring cash to employees, etc. - shows beyond a doubt that he was not part of a conspiracy to silence JFK's killer. Any true hit man would have been in position long before his target appeared.<br /><br />Posner reviews witness statements in the immediate aftermath of the assassination - not years later, when memories are \\"enhanced\\" by time and the desire for fame. Tales about puffs of smoke and in-flight surgeries vanish when we hear what people were saying and doing on or soon after that terrible day.<br /><br />As I said, I can kick myself for having wasted so much time believing the crazy, conflicting and conspiratorial stories about the death of the President in 1963. The damage to our country's spirit and faith in its institutions, fanned by the conspiracy salesmen, is hard to calculate. We are in debt to Gerald Posner for helping us put a traumatic event into its proper perspective.	2004-09-03

Twain shows himself to be a serious thinker about biblical issues, especially as they pertain to the saintly rogues and roguish saints who populated his world. The works in this volume expand on biblical themes, and are as human as they are irreverent. There is no sacrilege or blasphemy intended in Twain's musings -- simply the toil of a man trying to come to  terms with the sometimes illogical world inhabited by religious people.<br /><br />Twain muses on the story of Noah's ark by wondering about the germs that must have been stowed aboard along with Noah and his family. What kind of a God would ensure that such dangerous organisms would survive the \\"destruction\\" of life on earth, allowing them to renew their deadly work afterward? Twain's Captain Stormfield, recently deceased and on his way to heaven, shows the author grappling with the recently-discovered enormity of the universe, and with a heaven segregated (not by race and religion as one Earth) by planet and geographical region. \\"Letters from Earth,\\" authored by Satan before his banishment to eternal fire, makes rather pointed comments about earthlings' desire for a heaven that is both bereft of earthly pleasures (notably sex) and filled with activity that earthlings normally shun (singing, church services, rubbing shoulders with Jews, blacks and heathens).<br /><br />Few if any of the completed and incomplete works in this volume were published in Twain's lifetime. Yet the writings show him to be a religious man, in the sense of one who wrestles with the great eternal questions. Twain could not have been satisfied with the pious niceties he likely received from the religious worthies of his day. His questions continue to challenge us to enlarge our conceptions of the deity. Not for him was a deity who looked too much like the rascals and fools he encountered on a day's perambulation. Many of his questions (for instance about the historicity of the Bible) were very perceptive and continue to challenge us to this day.<br /><br />\\"The Bible According to Mark Twain\\" may not rock your religious world, but it will set you to thinking about the way that in every age, \\"God\\" acts and thinks suspiciously like ourselves!r instance about the historicity of the Bible) were very perceptive and continue to challenge us to this day.    \\"The Bible According to Mark Twain\\" may not rock your religious world, but it will set you to thinking about the way that in every age, \\"God\\" acts and thinks suspiciously like ourselves!	2004-09-02

Kathryn Harrison's brutally frank (though not unsympathetic look) at Saint Therese of Lisieux might be historically accurate but is bound to be a letdown for her most ardent devotees.<br /><br />Harrison uses family letters and the documents of Therese Martin's canonization process to paint a portrait of the Martin family and the world they inhabited. Even by the conservative standards of late 19th century France, the Martins were unusual, even odd. Both parents, Louis and Zelie, were extremely devout Catholics, to the point that Louis insisted on a \\"Josephite\\" or celibate union for the first 10 months of their marriage. All five surviving children -- eventually and sometimes with difficulty -- fit themselves into religious communities. The Martins were extremely wary of secular society, keeping their daughters from \\"worldly\\" pleasures that others thought charming and innocent. The portrait shows the Martins as a close and loving family, though extremely insular and somewhat fixated on death. Therese was a strange little girl obsessed with the things of the Church -- creating little altars in the backyard and holding funerals for dead birds. Perhaps these were among the few amusements she was allowed. Early separations from her mother left her emotionally fragile, never quite capable of internalizing an image of \\"Mother\\" that was warm and nurturing. Harrison sees Therese's embrace of convent life as a lifelong attempt to find a permanent presence that would never fail her, as her own mother did. Her bloody, tubercular death was difficult to watch, though inspiring (in its own way) for the way that Therese turned every pain and discomfort into a new sacrifice for God.<br /><br />There is much strength in Harrison's attempt to limn the psychology of this saint. Inasmuch as Therese fought her attachment to her body and sought to annihilate her personality, Harrison (ever the modern) works hard to reassemble a complete Therese -- emotional, social, psychological and even sexual. Sometimes, Harrison seems to overreach, attempting to discern sexual stirrings behind Theresa's concerns for \\"purity\\" and expressions of desire for a violent and rapturous union with Jesus. But better to err on the side of seeing Therese enfleshed than to imagine her as serenely unconflicted and untroubled by the impulses that all humans must deal with.<br /><br />I can't say that I came away from this book desiring a devotion to St. Theresa. Her discomfort with the world was too extreme, and her family life too constricted and introverted. Her experience and achievement, evidently inspiring to those of her time and beyond, seem a bit out of place today, as we attempt to live religiously *through* our flesh, not by shucking the body as evil. In any event, Therese Martin will continue to be honored as a spiritual athlete who pushed the envelope of piety as understood in her time, and who retained her devotion to God through intense self-negation and a protracted and painful final illness.ht to annihilate her personality, Harrison (ever the modern) works hard to reassemble a complete Therese -- emotional, social, psychological and even sexual.

The audio version also lacks the paper version's detailed timelines.<br /><br />The audio version of \\"Don't Know Much About History\\" highlights the history of America from 40,000 BC (with the arrival of Native American forebears) to 1990 at the end of the Reagan era. Author Kenneth Davis does a good job of selecting history's most important turning points (colonization, the Revolution, industrialization, etc.). He is also adept at raising the kind of questions that most of us only half-remember from high school history class such as, \\"What was the War of 1812 about?\\" and \\"Who were the robber barons?\\" Unfortunately, the \\"Don't Know Much\\" audio version doesn't always answer these questions. I was left with the impression, for instance, that the main issue precipitating the War of 1812 was the impressment of sailors into the British Navy and Henry Clay's \\"thirst for territory.\\" The first issue seems insignificant as a \\"casus belli\\"; the second left still more questions -- why was Clay so thirsty, and who did territory belong to? Coverage of some topics can be breezy indeed. The 8-years of the Revolutionary War were covered by the Lexington/Concord battle that started it and The Treaty of Paris that ended it.<br /><br />On the other hand, Davis avoids the inevitability of certain grade-school histories, which show seem to imply that history had to unfold the way it did. Davis also does a nice job of bringing the human motivations (not just the actions and statements) of historical figures to light. With Davis's exposition, you can begin to share the fear of Southern slave-owners in the face of Northern control of business and manufacturing. You can feel the tug of manifest destiny that drove settlers to take land from other peoples. Davis does not shy away from the dirty side of history. Robber barons, biased Supreme Courts, greedy settlers, circulation-hungry warmongering newspaper publishers and others are held up to (brief) scrutiny. I suppose that many who claim \\"Don't Know Much\\" is biased are mostly troubled by spotlighting the villainies of the rich and powerful rather than the glories of American military and economic victories. Davis's unvarnished approach would be uncomfortable to who are accustomed to deifying great historical figures. Yet though \\"Don't Know Much\\" sometimes spends too much time on the dark side of history, I appreciated its lack of romance and its even-handedness. Better to learn to live with the truth than to unlearn fantasy.<br /><br />\\"Don't Know Much,\\" the audio book, provides a quick overview of the broad terrain of American history--fit especially for those without the patience or interest to read the unabridged paper version. While that may seen like damning with faint praise, \\"Don't Know Much\\" is fun and valuable.

My fear in reading modern books about historical heros is that a better-researched telling will rub away some of the hero's luster. \\"Ride,\\" however, teaches new lessons about Revere, while actually enlarging his contribution to history.<br /><br />Hackett tells the tale of Revere, a Boston craftsman, who was a member of many of the colonial resistance organizations of his day. No one else knew as many colonial leaders and activists as he. When it came time to warn colonists of the British movements toward Concord (to confiscate stores of powder being stockpiled by local militias) Revere was a handy person to have in the saddle. Unlike the impression given by popular legend, Revere did not ride the countryside at random, but with purpose. Knowing the names and residences of the captains of local militias, he warned them of the British movements, allowing the captains to spread the alarm to their own militias. By the time the sun rose, militias throughout eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire were streaming toward Concord. Though stopped by a British patrol short of his destination in Concord, Revere set out on foot to Lexington to warn resistance leaders Sam Adams and John Hancock and to hide important documents. Revere's presence in Lexington as the British entered town, and his earwitnessing of \\"the shot heard round the world\\" were thrilling to read and retell.<br /><br />Hackett's retelling of Revere's story marks a shift (in my experience) from imagining heros as noble loners working in a social vacuum. Hackett reminds us that though Revere was personally courageous, persistent, intelligent, efficient and resourceful, his heroism required a matrix of others who were already well-prepared to mobilize against the oppressor. Hackett's analysis of the societal context of heroism was the overarching message of the book. Heros like Revere have no usefulness apart from a society primed to act; societies desiring change often need the elan of the individual to spur them forward.ize against the oppressor.

But when I ran across it in the bookstore, I felt oddly compelled to pick it up. Far from being loony, this book by Francis MacNutt (now there's a name for you!) has assembled a very straightforward account of his work delivering people from evil spirits.<br /><br />MacNutt takes seriously the talk of evil spirits in the New Testament. Unlike contemporary scholars who see demons as metaphoric or psychological in nature, MacNutt believes that Jesus Christ truly encountered and overcame dark spirits, and that part of his good news was that in him, the dominion of God had broken into the world to destroy a literal dominion of evil. This concept is simple and easy enough to accept. Though many mainline Christians call Jesus Savior and Reedemer, they often don't ask, \\"Saved from what?\\" and \\"Redeemed from whom?\\" MacNutt answers: \\"Saved from bondage to evil\\" and \\"Redeemed from the Evil One.\\" Simple answers like these are attractive, and more accessible than reams of scholarly texts explaining away what the gospels present without hesitation.<br /><br />MacNutt believes that evil spirits exist, that they infest or possess certain people, and that Christians have the duty and obligation to pray for deliverance from these spirits. He also believes that many main-line clerics are reluctant to deal with the demonic, leaving many to suffer the predations of the Evil One. In calm, unnutty tones, MacNutt catalogues a variety of evil spirits, the types of demonic oppression and the power of curses.<br /><br />MacNutt's thesis is fascinating, and empowering if true. If real, we should learn to recognize evil, protect ourselves from it and rid ourselves  of it. Not to say that he is completely convincing. Calling certain demons \\"laziness \\" or \\"anger\\" (...) comes pretty close to the psychologizing tendency of mainline churches. Some of his claims about the appearance of certain demons is silly. His depiction of a potbellied, top-hatted demon made me think he spent too much time in the voodoo shack. MacNutt also believes in ritual Satanic abuse -- a practice I thought invented by the media. Too, he seems to imply that priests (Roman Catholic? Anglican? Other?) are particularly empowered to cast out demons. What this means to MacNutt's seeming alliance with pentecostal and charismatic groups is not clear.<br /><br />In any event, MacNutt serves up a non-sensationalistic, rational-sounding and well-organized account of a topic that many in the West do not accept. As a hypothesis for the cause of evil in the world, it is fascinating -- especially for those who take Scripture seriously. While not providing a comprehensive theology of evil and its relationship to God, it goes a long way toward making a bizarre topic more acceptable.the appearance of certain demons is silly.

As a professional magician, James Randi is the perfect person to see through the frauds and phonies who make a good living gulling the public. \\"Flim-Flam\\" deliciously exposes the flummeries of fakes like Uri Geller, Erich von Daniken, the Bermuda Triangle, psychic surgeons and meditation gurus - often with simple logic, facts and duplications of their \\"miracles.\\" Compare Randi's homegrown picture of a levitator (really a teenager frozen in the middle of a trampoline bounce by a strobe flash) with the grainy and blurry \\"proof\\" of a TM levitation. You'll soon realize not only that Randi's shot is more expertly done, but how ridiculously easy it is to fake the \\"impossible.\\"<br /><br />After years of catching humbugs in the act, Randi gets caustic at times. But seeing the straightforward way he catches fakes is well worth the discomfort. People who claim to read blindfolded suddenly lose their abilities when Randi seals the crack in the blindfold with zinc oxide. Dowsers who swear they can find a steady flow of water flowing through a pipe six inches underground wander aimlessly and hilariously off the mark. Psychokinetic kids are caught on videotape using their hands to bend metal bars supposedly bent with brain power. The list of psychic gotchas goes on and on.<br /><br />Randi exposes not only tricksters but also the fools who need to believe them. That includes scientists who think their awesome academic achievements make them impervious to deception. Reading \\"Flim Flam\\" is an education -- about people who go to not-so-great lengths to persuade others of their supposed powers, and more importantly, about the limits of human powers of perception. After all, without the flim-flammable, flim-flammers would soon go out of business. Rationality owes Randi a debt of gratitude for this book and for his life's work of exposing falsehood.	2004-08-26

In simple, bold strokes, it tells the story of Roman Catholicism in a way that explores the 2000 year history of the institution without sugar-coating its problems or downplaying its triumphs. The book's style is somewhat reminiscent of the \\"Dummies\\" line of guides, including straightforward writing and sidebars to describe particular issues. The book is respectful and even-handed when describing Church crises, including the schism with the Eastern Church, the Reformation and the Inquisition. \\"Focus\\" pages help us see Catholicism from the point of view of its adherents, including a pastor of the Dark Ages and an unfortunate lay person summoned before the Inquisition. Saints and heroes get their due, from St. Francis to St. Thomas More to St. Teresa of Avila.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I used this book as a reference when working toward my Masters in Catholic lay ministry. It's great for keeping straight the plethora of dates, characters and issues that have arisen in the last two millennia.<br /><br />\\"People of God\\" is super for kids of middle school age and above, whether Catholic or not. It will answer many of their serious questions without alienating the Catholics among them from the sometimes all-too-human institution to which they belong.	2004-08-24

(Mark 13:22)	It's an odd day when a non-fiction thriller needs rebutting. But the consternation brought about by Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" made a response necessary. In \\"The Da Vinci Hoax,\\" authors Carl Olson (Catholic author and editor) and Sandra Miesel (a Catholic journalist who writes on history, art and hagiography) go head to head with the assertions in Brown's book, demonstrating one inconsistency or egregious error after another.<br /><br />Olson and Miesel use historical fact, scholarship and logic to demonstrate that many of Brown's assertions about the Church and its history are wrong or misconstrued. Belief in the divinity of Christ, for instance, goes back to the 1st century -- not the 4th as Brown asserts. The Council of Nicaea was not manipulated by Emperor Constantine to decree that Christ was divine. It definitively settled the argument about the *nature* --not the fact -- of his divinity. Also, it was long-standing Christian practice, not a Constantinian edict, that had Christians worshipping on Sunday. The authors also share scholarly consensus on the late dating of gnostic writing, which Brown falsely treats as contemporaneous alternatives to the canonical gospels. Olson/Miesel *facts* trump Brown *fancy* every time.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Hoax\\" also makes clear Brown's more-than-strong reliance on \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" and \\"The Templar Revelation.\\" Rather than doing his own research, it seems that he not only lifted these books' spurious conclusions, but their verbiage as well.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Hoax\\" very occasionally suffers from a defensiveness evident in Roman Catholics who see their Church under constant attack. The book would have been stronger, for instance, if it distinguished \\"feminists\\" who are hostile toward the Church from those who properly seek to challenge the flawed logic that underpins some longstanding and non-dogmatic \\"certainties.\\" In my experience, very few feminists are incipient or actual goddess worshippers.<br /><br />Carping aside, \\"Hoax\\" is an important effort to counteract the body blow that some peoples' faith took from reading Brown's book. The assertions in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"  should have been met with raucous, dismissive laughter. That they were met with stunned silence and even acceptance should alert pastors about serious shortcomings in religious education. I recommend \\"The Da Vinci Hoax\\" strongly to these pastors and to all who want or need an antidote to the falsehoods that Brown is passing off as truth.important effort to counteract the body blow that some peoples' faith took from reading Brown's book.

Bush	Books	5	28	33	N	N	More frightening than "The Exorcist"	When I first heard that John Dean had written a book on the Bush Administration, I confess that I rolled my eyes. Writing a new book seemed a perfect way to continue cashing in on Dean's long-faded Watergate cachet. How wrong I was!<br /><br />WTW is one of the most important and well-crafted expositions of the Bush Administration's assault on the US Constitution. In a carefully modulated tone, Dean lays out the case for what in others times would meet the \\"high crimes\\" standard for impeachment. Like many other anti-Bush books, Dean describes Bush's false and misleading rationale  for war in Iraq, his mania for secrecy and executive privilege and his selective use of intelligence to punish his enemies while shielding his own actions from scrutiny. Unlike these other books, Dean sees these activities not as the actions of a bumbler, fool and control freak, but as a well-planned scheme for stripping the Congress of control, concentrating power in the executive branch  and implementing an American-led world order. Sounds nuts until you experience Dean's controlled and effective presentation.<br /><br />Dean amply describes how Dick Cheney and other neo-conservatives are the true force behind the W's throne. His description of Bush's many failed business ventures (and his subsequent bailout by rich and sometimes mysterious \\"friends\\") is straightforward and enlightening. Especially damning is his description of the way Bush and his co-investors robbed the taxpayers of Arlington, Texas of the baseball stadium built at taxpayer expense. This legal fleecing is the true source of Bush's wealth.<br /><br />Dean details many ways that Bush emulates Nixon. Bush restricts the crowds at his speaking events just as Nixon deliberately avoided war protesters. Nixon, on the other hand invoked executive privilege only for national security matters and (as with the White House Tapes) to save his own neck. But Bush seems to invoke it reflexively, even for items unrelated to national security. His executive order sealing his presidential papers (as well as his father's!) is troubling, as is his unprecedented expansion of executive privilege to vice presidents.<br /><br />WTW will likely repel Bush partisans, but it ought to frighten those who take the Constitution's separation of powers seriously.al security.

Jacob's sons sacrilegiously slaughter Hamor's recently-circumcised clan. YHWH's night attack on Moses is thwarted by a perplexing smearing of blood. A Levite abandons his concubine to gang rape and uses her death to foment genocide. All of these tales are in the Bible. Yet their content is peculiar, distasteful and difficult to reconcile with modern preferences for a God who is undemanding and unthreatening.<br /><br />\\"The Harlot by the Side of the Road\\" is no mere unmasking of the sensational parts of the bible. Author Jonathan Kirsch retells each tale in a modern novelistic style, interspersed with the biblical accounts themselves, allowing us to read the original and its retelling side by side. Kirsch then uses these tales as springboards to explore ancient social mores as well as the development of the Bible itself. Kirsch helps the reader to recognize and set aside the strong moral and xenophobic tone of post-Exilic editors, allowing a peek into the looser social practices that held sway prior to Israel's return from captivity.<br /><br />The book's subtitle, \\"Forbidden Tales of the Bible\\" is a bit of an overstatement. While it's hard to find a home for these tales in a typical liturgical setting, the tales are hardly forbidden. What ought to be forbidden (at least taken with a grain of salt) are the head-spinning interpretations of some serious biblical scholars. Kirsch skims the conclusions of a number of scholarly schools--including Freudian, rabbinical, radical feminist and traditional--before finally settling on something more reasonable. Tamar's seduction of father-in-law (and patriarch) Judah, for instance, is difficult only if you insist that biblical morality never changed. But learning that the anti-prostitution Mosaic moral code postdated Judah's time by hundreds of years helps us to see Judah's behavior as less of an aberration.<br /><br />\\"The Harlot by the Side of the Road\\" provides no illicit thrills. But it may scandalize those who reject the idea that the Bible went through hundreds of years of telling and editing. Truth be told, Kirsch is on sound scholarly ground. The ideas in this book are old news in any middle-of-the-road biblical history course, including those taught in seminaries.<br /><br />For those who want a window into the violent and alien world of ancient Israel, and who are open to the idea that the Bible is a book with human fingerprints all over it, this book is strongly recommended.thrills.

For all of its snide tone and shortish explanations, \\"Loose Cannons, Red Herrings and Other Lost Metaphors\\" is enjoyable enough. The book relates the history of familiar phrases whose origins, due to changes in habits and technology, are lost to modern English speakers. Expressions like \\"it's raining cats and dogs,\\" \\"taken aback,\\" \\"minding one's Ps and Qs\\" (not to mention the expression about the brass monkey) are all included, along with short entries about their origins and sometimes original meanings. Who knew that a \\"rake\\" was short for \\"rakehell\\" -- a person so depraved that one would have to \\"rake through the coals of hell\\" to find his like?<br /><br />Entertaining as it is, the book has drawbacks. First, some of its entries are not terribly convincing. Claiborne sometimes spends more time taking potshots at explanations he disagrees with than in advancing his own. Also, Claiborne's tongue is sometimes planted so firmly in his cheek, and his style is so snide and acerbic, that his point is obscured. Claiborne's politics and religious preferences (or lack thereof) also come out from time to time, with no benefit to the reader.<br /><br />As an entertaining (if not always elucidatatory) work, \\"Loose Cannons\\" probably beats a dry, scholarly work on the origin of phrases, but reading it leaves me hungry for meatier fare.	2004-08-06

While I didn't laugh several times per page as some have, I did manage a good dozen involuntary chortles and snickers. Barry, for all his predictability, does occassionally deliver unexpected images that take you off guard, from exploding vacuum cleaners to drunken William Tells. Compared to the massively unfunny books written by many comedians (Seinfeld and Cosby come to mind) Barry's oeuvre (French for &quot;exploding weasels&quot;) is a sublime work of genius.<br /><br /> Barry has a way of identifying elements of male life that go unnoticed by most of us. How many of we married men think much about our wives' endless need to acquire and rearrange furniture? Dave's tale of the guy who made furniture from bags of old newspapers hit home. When I met my wife, I was less impressed by her looks and brains (which she had in spades) than by the fact that she owned a functioning kitchen table. DBCGG is a book for those of us who aspire to manhood (characterized by great thoughts and achievements) yet who manage only &quot;guyhood,&quot; whose greatest achievements include knocking things down, irrational devotion to sports teams and occasionally remembering the names of our offspring.<br /><br /> I, an almost fifty-year-old person of the male gender, personally rated this book a three. But judging from the constant laughter, tittering and guffaws coming from my teenaged sons, they would rate it a five. I've split the difference and given it 4 stars.<br /><br /> Note: except for two very short sections on intimate male behavior, this book is OK for ages 12 and up.	2004-08-03

From his exposition of the 19th century urban cemeteries movement, to Americans' fascination with all things Greek to his analysis of Lincoln's personal and public views of slavery, Wills satisfied my hunger for information while leaving me panting for more. Wills demolishes a number of persistent myths about Gettysburg. No, Lincoln did not write his address at the last minute on the back of an envelope; he had vast respect for the spoken word and there is ample evidence that he prepared his address thoroughly long before the Gettysburg dedication. Wills's description of the grisly, wretched work of burying and reburying battlefield casualties is a necessary counterbalance to the tales of soldierly courage and strategy that are the sum of other histories. Even the appendices are fascinating. Wills includes the text of the 2-hour oration of Edward Everett, the dedication's main speaker, whose work has often been diminished in relation to Lincoln's 3-minute speech. Reading Everett's long but excellent speech followed by Lincoln's short &quot;remarks&quot; has the effect of putting you at the scene.<br /><br /> Most importantly, Wills explains how Lincoln's address subtly but unalterably reinterpreted our country's founding documents. After Gettysburg, the idea that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; became a cornerstone of the American Dream, sowing seeds that sprung up in the many civil rights movements of the 20th and 21st centuries.<br /><br /> A remarkable and important book!	2004-07-30

Complain all you want about HBHG's authors as opportunistic hacks, their book is a fascinating read. I read HBHG in my mid-30s (long before pursuing a Masters in theological studies) and found it enthralling. The book introduced me to a long string of spooky, semi-sinister characters--Sauniere, the Cathars, Poussin, Plantard, Templars--and to &quot;hidden truths&quot; that tickled my belief in conspiracies and secret sources of power. For quite some time, I found HBHG's thesis plausible. But that was long ago.<br /><br /> I admit to being pleasantly shocked at the thought that Jesus's bloodline survives to the present. Many of us want to know Jesus; unmasking his great-great-?-great grandchild would be close enough for many. But the authors' conclusion (that Jesus's descendants are awaiting the right moment to rule a united Europe) is ridiculous and uninteresting to this American reader. Baigent, et al, seem to presuppose that we humans secretly long for a priest-king to lead us. While this romantic thought powers films like Lord of the Rings, its translation to real life leaves me cold and unimpressed. Kings and queens make for wonderful pageantry, witness our obsession with Lady Di. But who seriously wants even *Jesus's* descendants telling them what to do? Too, why just a unified Europe? Wouldn't a descendant of Jesus rule the entire world?<br /><br /> HBHG and its successors are akin to the endless line JFK conspiracy books--each one wilder and less plausible than the last. When an argument's conclusions approach absurdity, it's time to reject the premises.	2004-07-22

Instead, author Frum maintained a fairly non-judgmental, almost sociological tone to his writing. Except for the occasional cheap shot at a liberal celebrity or politician, the book is a rather thorough discussion of the surface trends that came to the fore in the 70s. I only read about 1/3 of the book, so I don't know whether a moralistic, conservative agenda ever emerged later on. But once I put the book down, I never picked it up again -- maybe because its pop magazine tone focused on outward appearances rather than on deeper social pressures that interest me. But as far as I read, this liberal didn't have much to disagree with. The 70s described in the book are more or less the 70s I remember. A deeper analysis would have kept my attention better.<br />Frankly, I was afraid that I'd feel used if, after being strung along for 3/4 of the book, an alien agenda emerged.	2004-07-09

The first half of the book is a day-by-day account of journalist Philip Smucker's travels to and through the Afghani war zone, beginning just after the war began. The second half of the book is a third-person chronicle of the fight for Tora Bora and of Project Anaconda, taken mostly from interviews with the Special Forces commanders involved in the fighting. This change of mode results in a bit of disjointedness. Luckily, the subject is fascinating and vital, allowing that shortcoming to be overlooked.<br /><br /> AQGE chronicles how the war, fought with unreliable Pakistani and Afghan proxies, never had a chance of defeating Al Quaeda. That the US allowed bin Laden to escape is either a sign that we are not serious about fighting terrorism, or that our military and governmental leaders are too stupid to run a real war. We had thousands of al Qaeda fighters bottled up at Tora Bora. Yet we chose not to lay siege and flush them out. Also, we hugely underestimated the resolve, tenacity and ingenuity of the Al Quaeda fighters. Fighting on while vastly outgunned and outnumbered, they held off the larger and better-equipped US forces and inflicted serious casualties. Was this the &quot;fog of war&quot; or the fogginess of mind in the Pentagon and the White House?<br /><br /> AQGE also offers a comic look at the media buffoons who used the war to bolster their own egos and ratings. Geraldo Rivera comes in for a special raking. His moving, from-the-scene &quot;report&quot; on the aftermath of an attack on American troops was complicated by the fact that he was never there.<br /><br /> Media mockery aside, AQGE stays within journalistic bounds by refusing to indict the perpetrators of the mismanagement of the war. Yet the problem was not the lack of bravery on the part of American fighting men and women. Political timidity and naivete, even with the American public fully committed to war after 9/11, played a large part in failing to commit sufficient men and materiel to the battle.<br /><br /> Given bin Laden's mindset, he probably sees his escape as deliverance by God. Far from showing our strength and will, the inept prosecution of the Afghan War will only embolden bin Laden and his followers. AQGE is a valuable tool for bringing out the truth about the current adminstration's ability and willingness to wage war on terror.committed to war after 9/11, played a large part in failing to commit sufficient men and materiel to the battle.

At over 200 pages, that's a lot of ranting! Anyone looking for a rational exposition of his thought will not find it here. This book is sheer energy, fury and emotion, often unfocused, usually off-center, but seemingly heartfelt. I know Savage a little better after reading the book, since he drops ample hints about his personal history. Savage parents were neglectful and remote. He grew up in a tough part of town and used his wits to survive. He bounced from one career to another, seemingly unfulfilled, until his radio career.<br />&quot;Savage Nation&quot; provides us with Savage's take on what he sees as the evils that are destroying America. He decries cultural feminization and homosexualization, political correctness, animal rights and illegal immigrants seeking free educational and welfare benefits. All these ills are placed at the feet of liberals and Democrats in general and the Clintons whenever possible. Savage doesn't try to back up these claims with facts, though he often promises to do so. Instead, he battles straw men via invented &quot;quotes&quot; that purport to tell what his enemies are saying beneath their real words.<br />Savage is always mocking, occasionally funny (&quot;Red Diaper Doper Babies&quot; is a classic), and maddeningly unpredictable. For instance, rather than agree with the extreme right-wing cant that all Arabs should leave the country, Savage wants to *prevent* them from leaving, ostensibly to harass them. He thinks America needs another Joe MacCarthy. And he praises family life in the 1950s, even though his own experience (and that of many others) amply demonstrates the shortcomings of childrearing during that period.<br />Occasionally, a gentle Savage emerges from the scorched ground.

Goldhagen's book is aimed at destroying the conception that Germany's psychosis toward the Jews as imposed from above (Hitler made us do it) or coerced (The Nazis would have killed us if we refused). Goldhagen provides numerous examples of Germans volunteering to kill; of being proud to by part of their country's special project; of torturing and humiliating when only killing was called for, of photographing their \\"heroism\\" (e.g., postcards of soldiers shooting women holding their children) for consumption back home.<br />Goldhagen focuses on killers who had the opportunity to say `no,' and to be transferred to other assignments, but who chose to pursue their homicidal duties. He demolishes the idea of Germans as bred to obedience by enumerating many examples where Germans challenged orders they did not like, even ignoring orders from the high levels of the Nazi party. By methodically stripping away the killers' post-war rationalizations, Goldhagen works his way to the actual cause of the slaughter: the German people's longstanding belief in eliminationist antisemitism.<br />The plight of the Jews who found themselves in the clutches of the barbarous Nazi killing machine is pitiful. Those who did not make it out in the early 1930s found themselves hemmed in by a people whose political leaders, legal systems, church leaders, even ordinary workers and children steeped in an antisemitism that seems more like mass psychosis than the product of a brilliant and cultured people.<br />The books does have weakness, notably its tendency to repeat itself. Some paragraphs come across as a writing exercise in \\"Find 10 different ways to express the same idea.\\" Goldhagen even manages to be repetitious across chapters. A book half as long would have made the same points more effectively.<br />Yet this weakness notwithstanding, \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" is a revealing window into the mind of Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It is chilling and disturbing and well worth the effort to brave the repetitions.o be repetitious across chapters.

In GBGM, author Michael Rose interviews former seminarians and current priests to claim that seminaries are dens of iniquitous gay sex, that \\"orthodox\\" candidates for the priesthood are turned away or intimidated, that female seminary directors are foisting feminist agendas on seminarians, that pornography is allowed and even encouraged and that the powers-that-be are turning a blind eye to the whole mess.<br /><br />I don't doubt that over the last 40 years, as the Church adjusted to the requirements of Vatican II, aberrations and irregularities were committed in the name of reform. But Rose has strung these stories together without reference to dates or places, producing an seemingly unrelenting torrent of abuses. Readers of GBGM get the impression that for 40 years, these abuses have take place on a regular basis in every seminary. Priest abuse scandals notwithstanding, this is just too much to swallow.<br /><br />Rose makes victims of \\"orthodox\\" seminarians. He paints them as normal, healthy sons of the Church who have been intimidated and offended by the debauchery and irreligion of the seminaries. However, since Rose does not clarify what he means by \\"orthodox,\\" it's hard to fully support him. He does however, drop a very few clues. To Rose, orthodoxy means believing a) that everything the Pope says is infallible, b) that Marian devotions (especially the Rosary) are central and necessary to Catholic prayer life and c) that the gospels were written by persons named Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.<br /><br />However, Rose should know that the Pope is thought to be infallible only when speaking *ex cathedra* -- from his position as teacher of the Universal Church -- on matters of faith and morals. The Pope's other pronouncements carry weight, but not the weight of infallibility.<br /><br />Second, as far as the rosary goes, Rose implies that seminarians got in trouble merely for engaging in this venerable Catholic devotion. But is there more to the story? Rose does not say. Perhaps these seminarians were closed to other legitimate forms of piety, such as the Liturgy of the Hours. Perhaps they were childishly attempting to recreate the piety of an idealized past. To these possibilities, Rose is silent.<br /><br />Third, that Rose's \\"orthodox\\" seminarians rejected the historical-critical method of scriptural exegesis is revealing. Pope Pius XII approved this method in 1943 as a means for understanding the development and original meaning of the Bible. A seminarian who rejects the historical-critical method might consider himself \\"orthodox,\\" but his superiors would rightly consider him immature and close-minded, and hence a bad candidate for the priesthood.<br /><br />It's too bad that Rose gives no space for seminaries to react to his charges. The fact that many of the book's sources failed to complete their seminary training (and might have an interest in hiding or shading that failure) seriously detracts from the book's credibility. Without testimony from the other side, GBGM unintentionally does disservice to the truth it desires to proclaim. In a day when loud, angry, polarizing voices predominate, a reasoned, balanced presentation about seminary life would be welcomed.ians were closed to other legitimate forms of piety, such as the Liturgy of the Hours.

The book also skims over several other less notorious cases of horrifying child abuse. All of these cases show the alarming propensity among some prosecutors in the 1980s and 1990s to throw otherwise law-abiding citizens into prison, using the coached testimony of young children. Not to mention the Catch-22 judgements of so-called child experts who convinced juries that a child's denial of abuse was proof that it had taken place.<br />The 1980s-an era when it was more and more common for working parents to entrust their children to day care centers-were ripe for bizarre child molestation cases. The guilt and anxiety parents felt over leaving their children with \\"strangers\\" made it easy for parents to believe that their worst nightmares were coming true. When outlandish charges arose, the path of least psychic resistance for parents was to swallow them whole them than with a grain of salt.<br />The book is a quick read, and sketchy on details. Rabinowitz states her conclusions about testimony rather than laying it out for us to judge on our own. The accused are all ordinary, noble souls with all the cards stacked against them; the prosecutors all blinded by ambition or stupidity, desperate to placate a howling mob looking for convictions. This left me with a certain discomfort: a classic tactic for ideologues is to paint reality in black and white, shouting their conclusions without disclosing their premises or evidence. There is some of this flair to this book. I'd love to see the Amiraults do something boneheaded that feeds into the mob's preconceptions, just to show they are capable of making mistakes. This weakness aside, it's hard not to be angry and frightened that prosecutors can so skew facts (in one case, holding back audio tape of an alleged perpetrator's anxious denial of the charges) and that the rest of us can so blithely go along with them. It's one thing to see this on \\"The Practice,\\" and quite another to see it in real life.<br />The post-9/11 environment is ripe for similar cases - this time targeting those who are perceived to be soft on homeland security.

US	47523096	R3TTKZKGQP8ART	1588720020	635598690	Crossing Over: The Stories Behind the Stories	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Is there a "there" there?	This book, subtitled, \\"The Stories Behind the Stories,\\" is mostly about John Edward's multi-year process of getting \\"Crossing Over\\" onto the air. It's about deal-making, costuming, scripting (or lack thereof), pilots, TV execs and the tortuous process of selling concepts. Oh, and about talking to the dead.<br />I was surprised, having seen Edward's confident appearances on Crossing Over, that he paints himself as introverted -- reluctant to become a public figure. He tells us repeatedly that he is shy, that he does not look for public acclaim, that \\"the Boys\\" (his spirit guides) withdraw when he is getting too much of a big head. Yet he shows himself as adept at executing tactical retreats to counter the claims of the skeptics. He is not doing cold readings, he says; he makes mistakes (that's OK, since a basketball player who hits only 50% of his shots is called a superstar!); he concedes Dateline's \\"gotcha\\" (they reported that he \\"read\\" members of the show's crew, to whom he presumably had day-to-day access); his show does not disproportionately edit out mistakes.<br />During the first 2/3 of the book, it was hard not to sense something rather reptilian in Edward's seeming attempts to throw the reader off the trail with self-deprecating remarks, gallows humor and spectacular stories. By the end of the book, though, I had to admit that even I found his plight somewhat sympathetic. Maybe I'm just a big softie, but I granted that he might really be hurt that so many doubt him and want him to fail. May he really is just trying to help the grief-stricken to come to terms with their losses. Did I losing my objectivity -- or merely my excessive skepticism?<br />Beyond the sheer amazement of being able to talk to the dead, I kept noting that Edward's readings provide so few deep insights. Occassionally, a spirit will tell a loved one a detail that helps the living to move on with their lives. That's a good thing, I guess. But I am confused. Edward's clients seem to be rather unchurched souls who need reassurance that their loved ones are still alive. Don't most faiths teach that the soul is immortal and survives death? Surely, these people are not so religious that they need an assurance that their loved ones have avoided hell fire. What then are they looking for? Why does it help to know that Mom or Brother or Grandma is alive and with us? Interestingly, one of Edward's female clients was freaked out (understandably) by his account that a deceased husband was watching her trying on lingerie. How can you move on when ghosts are watching us getting undressed and God knows what else? Edward doesn't deal with these implications of his work.<br />Edward's afterlife is much like that of other spiritualists going back into the 19th century: our loved ones are still with us, they are happy, they are accompanied by others who have \\"passed,\\" they wish us to move on. Kind of thin gruel from those who are presumably in the presence of God. And in spite of his belief that God is behind his work, Edward doesn't discuss his own religious views or (through his contacts) suggest ethical conduct for his readers. Contacting the dead is the beginning and the end of the process. Everyone gets to heaven  -- or at least to his gray and shadowy version of it. Edward's God is unjudgmental and largely absent. There are no demons or evil spirits, no requirements, no commandments, not demands, not challenges. And our pets are there too!<br />\\"Crossing Over\\" is a book by a self-confessed control freak who holds his most interesting cards tightly against his vest. He gives enough detail to satisfy his fans and other. But he gives skeptics plenty of ammunition to indicate he is the best cold reader around (C'mon John, reading the staff of your own show? Talk about looking for trouble!) While he is helping some bereaved to deal more effectively with their grief, he and his clients seem uninterested about the larger questions: how should we live? Are religions based on truth? Why do we suffer? What is the nature of evil, and how do we deal with it?<br />All told, the book made me want to see Edward's show, if nothing else, then to study his techniqued on truth? Why do we suffer?

First, at 229 pages of text, this was a rather short book, made shorter by Hansen's annoying habit of repeating important stretches of speeches. Second, the chapter analyzing the various drafts of the speech is probably better suited to a scholarly dissection of the speech than to a popular book. As was the chapter describing King's preaching style. And I got tired of ascribing every change in the speech to MLK's \\"genius\\". The man was exhausted, under threat and working on the run. Surely some of his decisions could have gone differently?<br />But minor grumpiness aside, I found this book hard to put down. The description of the organization for the August 1963 March on Washington was fascinating in its details about the people who attended it. One got the impression that the day was pretty disorganized, with the crowd making decisions on its own about when to start marching. Hansen also did a nice job of showing the internal disharmonies among groups within \\"the movement,\\" as well as hinting that MLK's leadership done to him rather than pursued by him -- less because of his ability to manage and lead than because of his philosophical sophistication, personal courage, stamina and eloquence. That King comes across as a preacher and a prophet (as opposed to a great organizer) does him no disservice, but actually helps to humanize him and make the Civil Rights movement more real. Hansen did a nice job handling the post-1963 life of the speech. He is honest about the impatience that some blacks felt about the 'dreaminess' of the speech, especially as the movement's gains stalled and the violence continued. Hansen nicely captures the slightly radioactive nature of the speech among national politicians (many of whom were wary of King's alleged Communist sympathies) in the years before King's death and the cloyingly hagiographic tributes about King and the speech after 1968.<br />Hansen shows how King's memory has been sanitized and rendered harmless by linking him exclusively with the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. In opposing the Jim Crow laws, a main (but not the only) point of the speech, King targeted a system that was abhorrent to Northern whites and a source of shame to many in the South. Getting rid of it was the relatively easy matter of making the abuses public. But King's next targets proved more difficult -- the hard work of eliminating more subtle forms of racism from American hearts on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. King's premature death allowed Americans to accept him as a national martyr and prophet, but ironically delayed the more difficult soul-searching about America's war plans in Vietnam, its endemic racism and the blind economic violence perpetrated against the poor and powerless./>Hansen shows how King's memory has been sanitized and rendered harmless by linking him exclusively with the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech.

Even though it is only about his own experience as a POW, it is very interesting and is a genuine page turner. Durant recounts almost everything that he experienced, from which day a certain food was brought to him, to what dreams he had on certain muggy Somali nights. What also makes this book one to read, is that although most of it is about his experiences during Operation Gothic Serpent in Mogadishu, he also recounts just as perilous tales of his time serving in Korea, Panama and Iraq as a helicopter pilot.<br />I am glad I read \\"Black Hawk Down\\" before \\"In the Company of Heroes.\\" \\"Black Hawk Down\\" gives an overview of the entire battle, whereas once Durant is captured, the rest of \\"Company\\" is only about him in captivity.<br />This book is about one man's absolutely unbelievable courage in a situation most of us cannot even fathom.

In fact, adhering slavishly to the text can only yield something as tiresome and unimaginative as the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, which I have excoriated elsewhere.<br />That said, &quot;The Last Day&quot; was thoroughly enchanting. Kleier has crafted a gem of a story line, and a host of pretty believable characters. Aside from the &quot;de rigueur&quot; Messiah and media figures (*must* these apocalyptic books all take place within UN or big media circles?) the book melds the secret military enterprises, mad scientists and religious charlatans into a fascinating web of action.<br />The writing and plotting are superb. More than once, Kleier tilted toward a high &quot;cheese&quot; rating (as when he named his Messiah figure Jeza -- get it? Like &quot;Jesus&quot;?) before pulling out again at the very edge of the farcical. And the questions he raised! As, can God work through a technologically-enhanced human being? Can something that looks very much like the Apocalypse occur completely by the effort of human beings? IOW, can the Apocalypse happen (with seeming fulfillment of all the prophetic signs) even if God did not intend it to? Where do the miracles leave off and normality begin?<br />A few nits: I'm annoyed with sticking the Catholic Church in the bad guy role yet again, taking a hit for having supposed secrets buried in the Vatican archives and for hoarding wealth that could benefit humanity. The Vatican treasures are priceless -- got that? -- without price; unsellable; worth-less. Too, must every Messiah figure live and die like Jesus, roaming sadly around the Promised Land with outstretched hands? Still, Jeza's parables were kind of neat. I also am leery of the message that we have all the answers within ourselves, that churches are unnecessary. Been there, done that. Gnostic Christianity died out because no two gnostics could agree for ten minutes on anything. Without major help from the Almighty (and a major diminishment in free will, which seems to occur toward the end) the Millennium portrayed in &quot;The Last Day&quot; would turn out the same.<br />Anyway, &quot;The Last Day&quot; had enough plot surprises and dramatic changes of perspective -- including a virgin birth! -- to keep the pages turning with pleasure.

In CCT2, the New Age oganization that's behind Chistopher's rise to power is beginning to come into focus. But there are twisting threads in the seemingly-straightforward plot. The good guys aren't looking so good, and the bad guys...yow!<br />The chapters where BeauS describes the damage done by the heavenly visitors are ASTOUNDING. Worth two stars just by themselves. As was the frightening description of the plagues, especially the locusts. BeauS's plagues are realistic and persuasive -- you can just feel the suffering of humanity bringing the economy and politics to a standstill.<br />Some carping: BeauS spends too much time in character close-ups. He doesn't spend much time reflecting on what is happening outside the tight circle of his main characters. We don't hear how ordinary people are coping with the calamities. Since the reader would be part of that mass of people, it would help to see how \\"we\\" would fare during the Apocalypse.<br />Still, the way Christopher turns scripture on its head to explain the personalities of YHWH and Satan was gripping. Is Christopher diabolical or phenomenally naive? Will Decker buy into this batch of tripe? Is Chris really locked into the Cosmis Fantastic or is he becoming his antiself?<br />Book 3 promises to have more twists and turns than a bowl of dropped spaghetti, and I look forard to devouring very delectable strand!	2003-07-23

Neat sci-fi idea: cloning Christ from an old relic. But the guy so-cloned doesn't have much of the personality of the original. He's just so...*young*. Maybe that'll develop over the course of the series. I also shuddered a bit when the guy remembers his previous life by saying, &quot;When I was Jesus...&quot; Feller, I know Jesus. Jesus was a friend o' mine. Feller, you ain't no Jesus!<br />Anyway, carping aside, BeauSeigneur does a nice job of working in skullduggery at the UN, origin of human life on other planets, new spins on old Scriptures, and a subtly developing sense that large forces are at play and just beginning to make themselves known. True, there are some rather tedious scenes at the UN. But BeauS has enough trust in the that he doesn't beat us over the head with every potential tie-in with Revelation. Hmmm...the UN organizes itself into ten world-wide governing units? Where have I seen that? Could it be the ten kings written of in the Apocalypse?<br />Now a question.

In the first 10 volumes, the heroes of the story spent a great deal of time congratulating themselves for being Christian. That's when they weren't beating or shooting the crud out of their enemies. And post-mayhem, our boys (and their girls) never seemed capable of scraping up enough compassion to worry about the teeming hordes of the unsaved, except of course when they were of their own family. But though the cosmos is literally falling apart around them, our gang is a horny as billy goats; there must be a dozen chaste pairings in the series - even some daring interracial stuff, though never with the white folks. Woo hoo!<br />Finally, in book 11 of the series, and 6+ years into the story, major character Rayford Steele seems to have taken notice of the people who will be snarfing red-hot twinkies at the end. Oh well, better late than never. While it's too late for these poor, tortured souls, it is nice that they can elicit a bit of brow furrowing from the saved.<br />Again in `Armageddon,' our Joes and Marys are packing as much heat as they can carry, in the form of ray guns that burn their enemies and some sort of big gun that blows craters into its targets. There's a weird paramilitary swagger in this book, with good guys carrying Uzis as casually as pocket Bibles. These are purely defensive,of course, and they try so hard to miss, but (shuckins!) if collateral damage doesn't just seem to happen! Where this colossal armory comes from is anyone's guess, but there you have it, all the way to the bloody cliffhanger that takes us (please, please please!) to the end of the series in the next volume.<br />And there will be much rejoicing...<br />The authors must have spent too much time in their youth at church camp, and boy do they make up for it here!

It's easy when you skip the long sermons, and the inane dialogue and wait until some kind of action happens.<br />That said, I do keep reading the books, though thanks to the American library system, I have not had to shell out a dime for the privilege. Though thin on substance, the first books did have enough meat to be occasionally satisfying. That hardly seems true of the last books, which seem to have hit some sort of time dilation mode where one book can spend hundreds of pages chronicling a few dull days.<br />What's wrong with these books? For one, outrageous premises. Knowing the level of rabidity of American gun enthusiasts, who could imagine US citizens (militias excluded) eagerly acceding to the removal of 90% of our weaponry? We're a paranoid bunch! We spend more money on arms than the next ten countries combined, and we are still afraid of being outmatched. Yet in Left Behind, we give it all away --- to the UN, of all groups! It's not that this is an impossible scenario, but Lahaye and Jenkins don't even bother to acknowledge the problem.<br />And wouldn't it be interesting if L&J were more up front with which of our planet's 6 billion souls would not make the cut into the 1 billion who are saved? Why not fess up that practically all Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims would land in hell? How about having Tsion put that in his pipe and smoke it? Did the Muslim children get raptured? Do Christians who were left behind still continue to their pathetic church attendance, not realizing that they are the \\"wrong\\" kind of Christians? And how about the wholesale, unimaginative ripoff of the Bible, as when Tsion has a dream that is taken straight out of Revelation 12? Couldn't the mark of the Beast have been something more original than the tired, old computer implanted scenario? And how about a little work convincing the reader that implanting the mark in hand or forehead wouldn't be a colossal tip-off, even to the biblically illiterate?<br />This entire series is bloated, lazy and offensive. I have been skimming along, hoping for imaginative treatment of the Apocalypse. Yet now that I am 8 books into the series, I'm afraid that even skipping the dreary parts is becoming an exercise in futility. It's really a feat to make the end of the world seem so tedious.<br />By the way, it's awful to see the supposedly Christian heroes of this series act in such an ungospel manner. Except for the imbecilic Hattie Durham, there is barely a whit of caring for the throngs of the damned. Steele realizes that Carpathia is about to vaporize a whole city, and all he worries about is that his own family makes it out. Steele nurses vengeance against the Antichrist without even an editorial tsk-tsk from the authors. I guess \\"turn the other cheek\\" went out the window after the Rapture.<br />Hint to L&J: read a little less of Revelation and a lot more of the Gospels!d, old computer implanted scenario?
