Rylant appreciates the simple beauty of night time sounds, from a creaking house getting comfortable for rest to an old pig rolling over in the straw to a sleeping dog's chain clinking. All quiet sounds that deserve observation. What initially caught my eye was the reference to a screen door closing in the night and the wonder of who might be up that late--I have often thought about things like that and I appreciated someone else's observation of the same thing. And what sold me on the book is when my four-year-old, after several months of none-interest in the book suddenly asked if I would read this book so he could wonder too about the person whose screen door closed in the night--obviously, Rylant's poetry in her prose is endearing and indelible. Szilagyi's artwork is appropriate to the text, neither overwhelming or boring. She has a nice, sublte touch that complement's the poetry of the book. Highly recommended	2005-08-06

The conversation between the mother and the little tiger is realistic and sweet without it being cloying. The artwork is spectacular--very colorful without being garish or too busy. This is a lovely pre-bedtime book that allows your child to get comfortable with the idea of going to sleep and discovering the positives in what might seem scary about nighttime. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.	2004-01-12

Not every dish won him over and not every dish was something I wanted to make for him (fish recipes are challenging enough for me to try), but overall, there are some great choices in here. For example, the Fruit and Cheese Cakes (basically, cheddar and apple pancakes) are truly delicious; the Peas and Carrots Balls incorporate an egg into the mix without your little one spotting it (for that matter, the carrots and peas are rather hidden too); the French Toast Sandwich went down with only a little coaxing. Jenest offers great advice on what to think about when cooking for your child, and she also gives tips on choosing store-bought foods when you don't have time to cook. <br />And it's a great price.<br />Please note that your child should be chewing well for most of these dishes.	2003-07-07

Some lovely words: \\"blueberry sky\\", \\"swings with your long strings up to the sky\\", \\"my blanket as soft as a kitten on my lap,\\" \\"the moon plays peekaboo.\\" Every page shows something a child would see on a trip from the country to the city. The art matches the words perfectly. My son loves looking for the moon on each page. However, the poetry doesn't flow off the tongue easily, even though there are some wonderful poetic moments. A near-great book for bedtime.	2003-05-04

Her sheer joy and appreciatation for the quiet, natural world around her make this a delightful read. She uses all her senses to describe the wilderness around her, and have no doubt, you will want to be at that lake immediately to experience the same beauty she witnesses.

Each page bursts with so many details it would be difficult to list them all here, although I'll try. For example, on the cheese \\"that lay in the house that Jack built\\" page, ten cheeses are listed with the level of \\"smell\\" they give off, and on the \\"cat that ate the rat\\" page, many different types of felines are shown with a description of their personalities--and those are just the start of what is on each page. How does this tie in with the story? I'm not sure, but it doesn't really matter--it's so much fun finding all the details as well as hearing the repeating chant of the story over again makes for a fine time reading. Very fun and should keep a little one busy. I highly recommend this book.	2002-10-01

Each page asks a question (what will you build, who will you be today) with an exclamation of \\"You choose!\\", allowing your youngster to respond. Then there are flaps to lift that give an answer. Murphy's simple but charming art flesh out the questions. For the price, it's a sweet book to engage your child.	2002-10-01

A wonderful romp through the alphabet with the mouse from Lunch--witty variations on what to do with each letter as the mouse tries to build the alphabet in order (action verbs introduce each letter: the mouse kinks the \\"k\\" and vacuums the \\"v\\"). The book also comes with a poster--a nice addition for those who like Fleming's work. Highly recommended.	2002-09-04

The art is fun, the storyline quick but engaging (Woof wants to find his little red ball and everyone helps), and the pull-tabs add a delightful element of cleverness (they create the \\"opposites\\"). The pull-tabs are sturdy, although I would probably wait until your child can handle a pull-tab without too much destruction--the tabs pull down/out a good bit and could easily bend under a child's enthusiasm. But don't let that hinder you from picking up this fun book. The design is well thought out and the \\"opposites\\" play well within the story. I highly recommend this title.	2002-04-29

This box set is an excellent concept: square- round- triangle- and skinny-shaped books for little kids to gain an understanding of these basic shapes. Radunsky has a delightful touch and subtle humor to his illustrations. (Skinny shows a pencil and a dachsund.) The size of the books is perfect for the 0-3 set, and each book contains about eight picture spreads. The four books also come in a nicely designed (albeit plastic) box, which makes them fun to pull out. Radunsky also has chosen uncommon (at least, I think so) items to show off the shapes: Square shows a cracker; Triangle shows a bird's beak and a street sign. For the price, I think this is a cool present for a two-year-old.	2002-04-29

Melanie Walsh's artwork is simple but yummy to look at--and there's some subtle humor going on in the drawings as well (a horse with a bone in his mouth--\\"Do horses bark?\\"). Each question posed elicits a chuckle and if you make the correct animal sounds when you turn the page, it can inspire more laughter. My 1-year-old son fell in love with this book immediately--usually it takes several readings before he warms up to a title. Walsh has done an excellent job for an early baby book, and I'm planning to look for the others she has done--I think her ability to capture a 1-year-old's attention immediately makes her work a worthwhile purchase. <br />A highly recommended book.	2002-02-19

By the end of the book, he's covered in all the remnants from what he eaten, leaving a very obvious trail to his home. This is a delightfully fun book to read, but I would recommend it for a 2-4 child; because each page leaves the reader &quot;hanging&quot; on what is the next item the mouse will eat, it is best for a child who can understand more complex concepts. <br />Again, Fleming has rendered a beautiful, if a bit abstract, visual feast for baby and parent alike. This is a fun book to add to one's library.	2001-10-25

The illustrations are just beautiful and rendered wonderfully (not as abstract as some of her other titles). The unusual animal choices make for fun reading: toucans, gnus, worms--my 9-month-old loves it. I look forward to each of Fleming's titles--when you have to reread a book umpteen times, her artwork is a joy to view again and again; when your little one is squealing in delight at each page and you are enjoying what you are reading, then you both are sharing a wonderful book and moment together. And, therefore, I highly recommend this gorgeous book.	2001-10-25

The basic concept of this book works well: a word on one side is illustrated and then shown again in a full-color scene with Olaf and Venus interacting with it. I like the art very much--Olaf and Venus are winning in their simplicity. <br />All four books in this series are wonderful mini-excursions to a commonly visited place and should keep a young one busy for a while.

My 9-month-old is just starting to stick his hand through the cut-out areas and, although he isn't guessing what the word on each page will be, he does laugh at each successive &quot;peek-a-who/moo/boo/zoo/choo-choo/you.&quot; Making the appropriate sounds to match each word also gets him laughing.

Olaf and Venus get in their car and head to the beach, checking out the sights along the way. A bird, a porcupine, a plane, the sea are all part of the trip. Pratt's charming and simple artwork bring each item to life--a word on one side of the page is shown again on the facing page with a full-color illustration of Olaf and Venus having fun. A wonderful book that kept my 9-month-old son amused on a plane trip recently. Highly recommended.	2001-10-25

From rhinos to lobsters, the frog asks each successive potential buddy if they hop. Eventually, he finds the right friend to hop with.

But as I have shopped, I've learned that many books marked Baby to Preschool are not always appropriate for a baby under 1 or even 2 (aside from being excellent for chewing) because the topic or text is too advanced. But sometimes, it's nice to find a book that conceptually works for the little ones. And this book is perfect. Very simple text about a little cat who wants to find a friend and a home. The story is not too cloying, and it's not silly. But it is humorous, cute, and sweet. The colorful artwork matches the sweet, rhyming text. Highly recommended.	2001-08-26

What a delightful book, about intrepid bunnies who see a star and want to go there. They climb into their space suits and proceed to their rocket ships. Once in space, they &quot;measure comets, chart the weather/gather moondust from a crater, scientists can study later.&quot; What I like about this book is its simplicity for a baby (perhaps 8 or 9 months) as well as some thoughtful concepts for the older child. You can sing the rhymes to the song &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; or read them as is. The artwork is fun, humorous, and charming, almost 50s minimalist. An excellent book for your youngster.	2001-08-26

This book is a delightful romp through the farmyard, with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly, causing the ruckus with all the animals. The abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and, therefore, may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck, the kittens in the hayloft, the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. But a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing Fleming's gorgeous art each time. My nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. I highly recommend this book.	2001-06-20

The color photos are a joy to look at. However, I don't like the way the book is organized--it's difficult to find what your looking for because things aren't arranged in logical order. In addition, I think it's a shame to have black and white photos--the majority of compacts really can't be appreciated unless they are seen in color, hence my 4-star rating. Mueller's two books are arranged better, with color photos for every compact, and Gerson should have tried to emulate that while making the book her own. But this book complements Mueller's, and for a rabid compact collector, this book is a welcome addition to the other books out there.	2001-06-20

Mueller gives fine intros to each of her topics, educating the reader on the makers, the different styles, and where to focus your collecting if you don't have big bucks. Mueller also doesn't jack up the prices to astronomical heights like Gerson's book--prices are reasonable and acceptable for easy- and hard-to find compacts.

Yes, there's a simplistic theme running through the pages, but a young child listens for the repetitive phrase and looks for the big, colorful images.
