US	50920512	RA6V9XA9VJ4SA	0394495985	340102790	Painting the roses red	Books	5	3	3	N	N	1st offering from a veteran master storyteller.	Here is the first book ever written by Michael Malone, who would of course go on to write so many other dazzling works - DINGLEY FALLS, HANDLING SIN, FOOLSCAP, the Justin and Cuddy mystery series and THE LAST NOEL among them. So PAINTING THE ROSES RED is remarkable in that fashion. <br /> <br />Malone's heroine and narrator Constance Mennagan is a graduate student at Berkeley in the late 60s-early 70s. At the heart of the novel, Constance is torn between two men: The ex-lover she can never quite seem to work out of her system, Ty, and her husband, a by-the-books sort named Gregory. <br /> <br />PAINTING THE ROSES RED is very much a story of its time and setting. Constance and her friends hold elaborate philosophical and intellectual discourse conversations; Constance mourns the loss of Janis Joplin and oftentimes ponders the role of the woman of the decade, sexual mores and all. In many ways, PTRR is very much a snapshot of the era. <br /> <br />It is also a snapshot of the innerworkings of a woman's mind, as imagined by the very male Malone, who would go on to create many strong female characters, like the central figure in his short story \\"Red Clay\\" or Irish rock star Mavis Mahar in the Justin-Cuddy mystery FIRST LADY.  <br /> <br />PAINTING THE ROSES RED is essentially Mennagan's thought journal, and told in a mixture of stream of consciousness and diary entry format, as she wrestles with staying faithful to Gregory or following her heart and body with Ty. Intricate and complex, this approach sometimes makes the novel tougher to retain, but oh-so-satisfying when it clicks. <br /> <br />If for nothing else, PAINTING THE ROSES RED is worthy of a look -if you can find one; it's high value is no doubt related to its rarity, and Malone even addresses his own reported discomfort with the sexuality of the book in his interview with J. Kingston Pierce of January magazine at [...] <br /> <br />You've been quoted as saying that you're glad there are \\"very few copies of [Painting the Roses Red] available anymore.\\" Why would you prefer to keep it out of readers' hands? <br /> <br />My comment was a little facetious, but it is true that Painting the Roses Red is a very youthful and exuberant book, set in the wilds of the 1960s in Berkeley, California, and rather more festively sexual than I would have made it here in my staid middle age. <br /> <br />It's fascinating to have read Malone's later works, to have the whole of his ouevre in mind when reading the book he began writing with, to see what themes and methods he will use throughout his literary career, and what will ultimately be abandoned by the wayside. Finding and reading PAINTING THE ROSES RED is ultimately an undertaking and an experience, and anyone who makes the journey will find their hearts and intellects the better for it by voyage's end.	2004-09-06

Perhaps that's because \\"Underpants\\" is an adaptation of a 1910 comedy by Carl Sternheim. <br />The play is really about bored housewife Louise Maske, who is at a parade to see the king when her underpants fall down to her ankles. The event scandalizes her boorish husband Theo, who frets over what this could mean to his piddly job. <br />In no time, however, a couple smitten men who happened to witness the event turn up to try to rent out the single room, in hopes of getting closer to Louise. She finds herself taken with the idea of an affair with charismatic poet Versati, but sickly, lovesick Cohen keeps getting in their way. <br />What follows is an apparent comedy of errors, but either these particular issues don't translate well to the 2000s or, more likely, Martin's words meant for the stage don't necessarily translate well to the page. <br />Unless one is a diehard Martin fan, there's no reason to sift through the play over and over in order to appreciate it (although multiple readings do help). It's more bland than bad, though. But nothing of the quality of Martin's other works, like \\"Shopgirl\\" or the fantastic \\"Picasso at the Lapin Agile.\\" Not even of his Academy Award hosting stints. (Remember the line \\"I took a 9-year-old kid to see 'Gladiator,' and he cried through the entire film. But maybe it's because he didn't know who I was.\\"?)<br />In fact, there's really only one time it is certain that Martin is in the house, when Gertrude, Louise's busybody neighbor, announces that she has just come from the theater, to see a play by Sternheim. <br />Louise: \\"Should I see it?\\" <br />Gertrude: \\"Wait till it's adapted.\\"	2003-10-09

The 17th letter of the alphabet finally gets its due with the arrival of Sue Grafton's latest in her alphabetical mystery series, \\"Q is for Quarry.\\" <br />Alibi, burglar, corpse, deadbeat, evidence, fugitive, gumshoe, homicide, innocent, judgment, killer, lawless, malice, noose, outlaw, peril ... These are what the previous letters have stood for for Grafton's quintessential private investigator, Kinsey Millhone. <br />It's all counting down to her final, 26th book in the series, already titled \\"Z is for Zero.\\" <br />A long time ago, I sat down to read all of the books in the Kinsey series. I started with \\"A is for Alibi\\" and got all the way up to \\"L is for Lawless\\" or \\"M is for Malice\\" before overdosing, and swore not to check back in on Grafton or Millhone until an interesting letter came along. <br />In reading \\"Quarry,\\" I haven't exactly been made to regret my decision. <br />Not that there's anything wrong with the series. It's quaint and cozy, comprised of good mysteries to snuggle down with. However, it feels as though Grafton might be holding back on the stuff that's really going to knock our socks off for the even later books, rather than taking steps to guarantee readers remain at attention at all times. <br />\\"Quarry\\" has some of these issues. With the exception of several too-brief scenes where Kinsey hangs out with friends at a restaurant, or finally gets hold of a photo of her deceased mother, whom she has never met, we never really get inside her head. <br />She is too consumed with the current mystery at hand, a (according to Grafton in her afterword) based-on-real life case in which an unknown girl mysteriously turned up dead years ago in a rock quarry, but could never be identified. <br />Now, the retired cop in charge of the case is doing poorly health-wise, and a co-worker hires Kinsey to do some of her own investigating to put some spring back into his step. <br />This puts her in the circle of some interesting characters, especially entertaining jailhouse snitch Pudgie Clifton. The Pudgie and Kinsey scenes hint at something that could have made for an even more interesting read; they crackle with tension and humor. More of this would have meant more fun for the reader. <br />There is also a crucial case witness who admits that she lied to the officer on duty about the whole thing so that she could ask him out (the officer is now her husband). <br />I think, at this point, people are either going to read Grafton because they've hung on this long and want to see the series through to the end, or for the sheer audacity of writing a 26-part series. There's very little to offer those who just want to read a compelling story. \\"Q\\" is decent; it just never quite makes it to \\"good.\\" <br />So I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about checking out again until the next interesting letter comes along. <br />\\"X is for Xenophobe,\\" anyone?	2003-04-13

His plans for doing so include creating his own comic strip, which bears a striking resemblance to \\"Dilbert\\" (after perusing a \\"Dilbert\\" desk calendar, Rat informs his pals that he has about 365 new ideas for his \\"Bildert\\"), hosting his own television show and interviewing local celebrities like the waitress at the Waffle Barn and his garbageman and just basically insulting Pig. <br />Pig is naïve to the point of stupidity, which makes him the perfect foil for Rat's schemes, and also excellent comic fodder. He makes friends with a reflection of himself in a small pond (\\"You remind me of my other friend, Mr. Quiet Medicine Cabinet Guy\\"), plays hopscotch on chalk body outlines and ... simply exists, trying to muddle through. <br />My absolute favorite \\"Pearls Before Swine\\": <br />Rat to Pig: \\"If you could have a conversation with one person, living or dead, who would it be?\\" <br />Pig: \\"The living one.\\" (Pause.) \\"You must think I'm really stupid.\\" <br />Hee-larious. <br />Pig and Rat are the big names, but they are joined by socially conscious Zebra, who is trying to get the herd back home to stop getting eaten by alligators, and Goat, who is the voice of reason in the strip. Goat doesn't show up all that often. <br />Overall, it's a quiet, little strip that is capable of eliciting big, loud guffaws.	2003-04-02

Oates' oeuvre is ominous. <br />Since 1964, Oates has been a machine, often times releasing three books in a single year, and then going on to release three more the very next. <br />The list of novels, then, is obviously a long one, with titles like \\"them\\" (1969), \\"The Triumph of the Spider-Monkey\\" (1976), \\"Lives of the Twins\\" (1987), \\"Soul/Mate\\" (1989), \\"I Lock My Door Upon Myself\\" (1990), \\"Because It is Bitter, and Because It is my Heart\\" (1990), \\"Nemesis\\" (1990), the Oprah pick \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" (1996), \\"Blonde\\" (2000) and \\"Middle Age: A Romance\\" (2001) among them. <br />In 2002, Oates only released two titles: \\"Beasts\\" and, as if her extensive biography were not enough of a threat to struggling authors already, her first young adult book, \\"Big Mouth & Ugly Girl.\\" <br />But it's not enough that she's simply written it. No, it has to be good, too. <br />In fact, the book is so good, one wonders why Oates hasn't been writing for young adults the whole time. This is the best offering in that genre to come along in a while. It's written intelligently, is provocative, timely and strong. <br />High school student Matthew \\"Matt\\" Donaghy (the big mouth) suddenly finds himself being led out of class by the police one day. The reason? He's suspected of making bomb threats against the school, Rocky River High. <br />Ursula Riggs (the ugly girl) doesn't believe a word of it. She knows Matt is a clown, a goofball, a joker, and that if he did make threats against the school it was all in jest. But Ursula seems to be the only one who knows that. <br />By the end of the day, Matt's name hasn't been released to the general public, but everyone in school knows he was the one who was suspended for three days while the administration tries to figure out how to handle the situation. Matt's friends won't e-mail him back, except to tell him that they're not talking to him on the advice of their parents and their parents' lawyers. <br />Only Ursula believes in his innocence, eventhough she and he have never really talked to each other. <br />\\"Big Mouth\\" is a tough read, because Oates doesn't flinch from her portrayal of human emotion. Even when Matt is cleared, the kids at school still don't quite treat him in the same manner they did before. And the community is outraged when Matt's parents sue the school over the damage to their reputations and the undue stress of the accusations. <br />The topical issues that arise (we all remember Columbine) are difficult to take too. Readers will leave the book angry, hopeful, scared, happy, sad - a wide range of emotions. Good. These are thoughts and feelings that shouldn't be swept under carpets, and Oates is courageous enough to put them out there.<br />If you never read another Oates book again (and there are many; although it seems it would be impossible to ignore her), make sure you read this endeavor. And if you've never read her before, let this one be the first.	2003-03-28

Once upon a time, there was a legendary supercouple named Luke and Laura.<br />Luke and Laura revolutionized the daytime soap opera with their romance, a love story that began as a rape, carried on into a summer on the run from the mob and culminated in a ratings extravaganza of a wedding after stopping the evil Cassadines from freezing the world.<br />The whole phenomenon took place on ABC's \\"General Hospital\\" more than two decades ago.<br />Writer Thom Racina was the head writer of \\"GH\\" back during the L&L heyday, and he's still making waves today.<br />Today, Luke and Laura may essentially be kaput (she's in a mental ward after apparently murdering long beloved character Rick Webber; he's going nuts without her), but Racina's thriller, \\"Never Forget,\\" proves he's still got what it takes to grab the attention of an audience.<br />The new novel opens with the death of Hollywood superstar Max Jaxon as he films a climactic hang-gliding scene for his new movie. From there, it's up to police detective Christopher Daniel to retrace Max's steps and uncover the events leading up to his apparent murder, which we see unfold.<br />Max is discovered by hot director Maggie Nash, with whom he has a sizzling affair. They are joined by rising ingenue Kristen Caulfield, but soon Kristen and Max are falling in love behind Maggie's back. Did his spurning of her turn Maggie insane? Or did Max's inability to commit drive Kristen over the edge?<br />Along the way, we are introduced to several other characters who might have had their own reasons to see Max crash and burn, like Maggie's wicked younger stepmother, Nicole, who had her own designs on Mr. Jaxon. Or did producer Bruce Borger, who carried a torch for Kristen, do the dirty deed? And what of Max's mysterious old friend, the unseen Nicky?<br />It's a nest of vipers, a den of snakes, and they all writhe under Racina's careful watch. The author has said this is most likely to be his biggest success because it is his sexiest, and the graphic nature certainly lends credence to that speculation. <br />After all, \\"Never Forget\\" did get picked up as a book of the month for the Doubleday Book Club and the Mystery Guild for September 2002.<br />\\"Never Forget\\" follows Racina's grand tradition of books with interesting, gripping plots that are a sight to behold as they progress. <br />In his \\"The Great Los Angeles Blizzard,\\" (a precursor to Mikkos Cassadine's weather machine), a, um, blizzard hits Los Angeles. In \\"Snow Angel\\" we see a psychotic killer murder the parents of the object of his obsession to grow closer to them. In \\"Hidden Agenda,\\" the heroine is a big star news reporter who might just be the center of a massive conspiracy to control the news, while the heroine of \\"Secret Weekend\\" finds herself trapped at the top of an unfinished apartment building and at the mercy of a killer.<br />Like these, \\"Never Forget\\" is very much a \\"Watch what happens under these circumstances\\" book, ruled by Racina's wild imagination and fueled by his great sense of entertainment and intrigue.<br />They're wild, unpredictable and fun.<br />And like the legends of Luke and Laura, these creations of Racina's may prove to be unforgettable indeed.	2003-03-23

Java is filled with unlimited possibilities.<br />Consider this: I was at a local coffee place with a friend who was leaving town. He ran into the coffee shop's lending library (take a book and either return it or replace it for the other interested readers around you) and came back out with a book that he said had caught his eye during his many excursions for caffeine.<br />The book was Jeremy Leven's 1982 \\"Satan: His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, J.S.P.S.\\"<br />Quite a mouthful of a title.<br />I nodded politely and began edging toward the door.<br />But my friend's description of the book (\\"Some doctor develops a computer program that believes it is Beelzebub, and proceeds to give it therapy\\") intrigued me. So, after a few weeks of tossing and turning, I decided to return downtown and check out the book.<br />The story is a little more complicated than that. Dr. Sy Kassler does indeed see a computer that may or may not turn out to be Lucifer, Prince of Darkness. But there are many hilarious twists and turns to this 500-page tome, and many different aspects to the plot.<br />SATAN: The computer, if that is what it is, is the brainchild of the genius Dr. Leo Szlyck. Szlyck is called to connect and create a mysterious bunch of wires and synapses to result in ol' Mephistopheles. But it is during the course of therapy that the Dark One asks us to ponder, \\"Think about what it must take to dare to be God's enemy.\\"<br />THE UNFORTUNATE DR. KASSLER: Sy Kassler is indeed unfortunate. We first meet him coercing an STD-beleaguered, only-Italian speaking girl into his bed. Then there is his subsequent love affair with and marriage to the commitment-shy Vita, who turns psychotic after the birth of their first child. Kassler leads the life of a tragic figure. And now he's treating Satan? God help him. Literally.<br />EVERYTHING ELSE: There's Lupa, the beautiful woman who falls in love and has an affair with the computer; Sam Zelazo, Kassler's boss and Szlyck's archnemesis and a multitude of other plotlines and characterizations that make the on-cover comparison to novels like Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" seem very apt.<br />It is a story that is very much about Satan's psyche and those of the people surrounding him. Leven compiled a classic comedic think piece with \\"Satan,\\" and philosophers and comedy seekers alike should seek it out.<br />Author Robert Heinlein has a quote on the back of the book that is so appropriate to the tone and mood of the book that it deserves to be the last word:<br />\\"'Satan' is terrific! I could not put it down. However, Jeremy Leven will be lynched if they ever catch him.\\"	2003-01-16
US	50920512	R2SLQG01BECQD2	1402200129	797562568	The Last Noel	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	Good winter read from a fine writer.	Everything is suddenly coming up Michael Malone. The award-winning writer just took up residence again on ABC's daytime soap opera, \\"One Life to Live,\\" the site of his former head-writing glory, this time as a consultant.<br />Not only that, but the past few months have seen the addition of another novel to his already impressive gallery (including \\"Foolscap,\\" \\"Handling Sin\\" and a selection of short stories entitled \\"Red Clay, Blue Cadillac\\").<br />\\"The Last Noel\\" was released in enough time for the holiday spirit, which it invokes to start kicking in.<br />I like Malone. <br />His books are like the equivalent of a warm cup of cocoa on a day in which a massive snowstorm rages outside. <br />You don't care how bad the weather is outside because you're inside, you don't have to go out and you're happy because you have cocoa.<br />\\"Last Noel\\" is no exception to this precedent. It is the story of the relationship between Noni, a heartstrong Southern belle, and Kaye, the bullheaded grandson of Noni's parents' maid.<br />In a nifty trick, Malone unfolds Noni and Kaye's story as it spans decades by visiting them once every other Christmas or so (12 chapters in all - can you say \\"partridge in a pear tree?\\"). <br />We first meet them as 7-year-olds on Christmas morning, when Kaye breaks into Noni's room to tell her that it's snowing outside and he wants to use the sled that's waiting for her under the tree.<br />Next we see them five years later, and catch up on the mutual tragedies that have marked their lives. So it goes. <br />At 15, Kaye rescues Noni from a dance date turned ugly; at 20 she's getting married to the [guy] and Kaye is a little torn over the whole thing; at 28 Noni is divorced and has a child (but is her son really her husband's?), while Kaye, now a successful doctor, seems well on the way to a happy marriage.<br />It's wondrous to see events unfold through these two forever-linked lives, and the storytelling technique Malone has selected lends more than asmall element of magic to the proceedings. The characters draw the reader in; they come to feel like family.<br />\\"Last Noel\\" is a cozy book about friendship and grand passion, told by one of the best authors of our time. Everything that Malone spins out winds up gold (I'm definitely setting my VCR for \\"One Life to Live\\") and is told intelligently, sweetly, superbly.<br />Like I said, it's just like an excellent cup of cocoa.<br />With marshmallows on top.	2002-12-30

Magazine and newspaper headlines have been trumpeting the news that King is calling it quits for the past month or so. <br />The uber-horrormeister has declared that after something like the next three television miniseries and the conclusion of his ultimate saga, \\"The Dark Tower\\" series, he's going to enter J.D. Salinger territory and write purely for himself, without the goal of publication. <br />He sounds pretty serious. <br />I'll believe it when I see it, however. <br />In the meantime, King's announcement certainly hasn't hurt sales of his latest book, \\"From a Buick 8.\\" <br />\\"8\\" marks a return to form for King. With the exception of \\"Black House,\\" his sequel to \\"The Talisman\\" co-written by Peter Straub, King has gone for the brains over the chill factor with the recent entries to his gallery. <br />But \\"8\\" sets us back on familiar turf. <br />It is the story of the band of state police officers at Troop D in Pennsylvania. Ned Wilcox, the son of a fallen comrade, begins hanging out at the station in order to preserve his own sanity in the aftermath of his father's death. <br />Soon, Ned uncovers a mysterious Buick 8 in one of the station sheds that has haunted the troopers over the past few decades. Much like King's other story about an evil car, \\"Christine,\\" (it is this apparent recycling of tales that has driven King to his declaration of retirement, although this is premature; the stories are not that similar) there's something wrong with the vehicle. <br />Years ago, Ned's father Curt and partner Ennis Rafferty answered a call from a gas station about an apparent suicide, in which a mysterious traveler vanished without a trace and left the Buick behind. <br />They feel uneasy about it, but bring it in and let it sit. Soon, Ennis is gone without a trace, and Curt borders on the point of obsession with the car. <br />This story is told to Ned from the perspective of the veteran troopers who were there, especiallythe main narrator, Sergeant Commanding Sandy Dearborn. <br />Will Ned find Curt's obsession with the Buick 8 to be hereditary? <br />The storytelling narration works for the tale, as we sit enraptured as King spins his yarn. <br />But there are some quibbles to be had with the book, although certainly nothing to retire over. It's not a recycled plot; it feels like vintage King and is the equivalent of pulling on a familiar, fluffy gray sweatshirt or sliding in between some well-worn bed sheets. <BR> <BR>But there is more to be spooked by and more of an element of danger in the story Sandy and his comrades tell Ned then there appears to be in the story wherein they exist. <br />The secrets of the past certainly feel like they are being built up to influence the contemporary figures, but there's no real payoff. <br />The ending is almost anticlimactic and peaceful compared to some of the stuff we see and hear come out of the trunk of the mystery car back in the good ol' days. <br />King's got a clever cast of characters here as well, from the gas station owner who we learn eventually claims Curt Wilcox's life, to beleaguered veteran Sandy and the beguiling communications officer Shirley Pasternak. <br />They have potential but lack the punch we think they should have in the end. <br />If it were up to me, I'd assign him to work on a couple more novels until he gets it right. <br />\\"8\\" is as if King is pushing a slightly stalled car steadily up a hill, and making progress the whole way, but in the end he doesn't quite have the extra oomph to put us on the other side, speeding toward home.	2002-11-17

One of the more inventive mysteries out there actually belongs in the sci-fi realm.<BR> <BR>David Brin, whose novel \\"The Postman\\" was later turned into the good adaption but poorly received movie starring Kevin Costner, puts a new spin on the private investigator tale in his new book, \\"Kiln People.\\" <br />Albert Morris is an investigator in a future where people make clay duplicates of themselves in order to gain more experiences in life. Your clay \\"ditto\\" can do mundane tasks for you, like go grocery shopping or do the dishes, or something exciting like going and getting in a gunfight or having sex. <br />As the original, it is then your choice whether or not to \\"inload\\" their memories into your own. <br />As a p.i., the dittos are especially helpful for Albert, as they enable him to send out many versions of himself on his cases. Sometimes, he tells readers, his dittos solve mysteries that he will never have any recollection of. <br />The dittos themselves might have short shelf lives, but they are essentially the exact replica of the original, with all of his/her memories and thoughts. <br />Sometimes, this is a bad thing, as Albert discovers when the green duplicate he made to do the dishes goes AWOL to go surfing at the beach. They call instances like this Frankensteining. <br />It can also be a good thing, as \\"Frankie\\" ultimately becomes enmeshed in the plot Morris is working to uncover (more on that in a minute). <br />But either way, it's a weird thing. <br />One of Albert's gray duplicates (there is apparently a whole rainbow of clay to work with, like Play-Doh): <br />\\"While I donned a scratchy gray jumpsuit, real-me got up from the padded scan-table and cast a glance my way. Our eyes met. If this me makes it back here to inload tonight, I'll remember that brief moment of contact from both sides, worse that staring deeply in a mirror, or bad déjà vu, which is one reason why we do it seldom.\\" <br />The case Morris finds various versions of himself on is pretty intricate, so the reader must pay attention or end up lost. At the heart of it is an explosive secret that may change the industry of dittomaking forever, and rattle the golem-infested society to its very core. <br />Brin has always been a delightful writer, and \\"Kiln People\\" is no exception. The author has spun from his imagination an entire world, and it's great fun to go forth and explore. <br />The narrative can be tricky, as it bounces from real Albert to each of his duplicates and back again, but one doesn't need a scorecard in order to keep up with the action. <br />In the end, this feat of clay turns out to be one of the more refreshing pieces of fiction recently released.	2002-10-29

Fran Drescher made a name for herself on the hit CBS sitcom \\"The Nanny.\\"<BR> <BR>For years, her whiny accent and shenanigan-heavy onscreen romance with her English employer kept audiences rolling. <br />But, as we learn upon the opening of \\"Cancer Schmancer,\\" Drescher's new autobiography, life was not all roses behind the scenes. <br />\\"The Nanny\\" became ratings-challenged, Drescher's marriage to her husband and business partner was beginning to fizzle out in the wake of her horrifying rape at the hands of some robbers at their home. <br />Then, to top it off, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. <br />The title alone should warn people that \\"Schmancer\\" isn't exactly going to be a fun, fuzzy feelings sort of book, although the comedienne tries to lighten the mood right off the bat with a [weak] \\"dream sequence\\" in which Nicole Kidman appears at her bedside with a new movie script and Brad Pitt turns up, renouncing his marriage to Jennifer Aniston in honor of Fran. <br />Drescher tries to balance the story of a struggle which every woman potentially faces with her own tale of a celebrity who faces a medical emergency, and the two don't exactly mesh together. <br />But this is Drescher's story, and she apparently tells it true to form, so a little stardom thrown in isn't unforgivable. <br />The real sin of \\"Schmancer\\" is that its author doesn't know when to quit. <br />As Drescher recovers from her surgery, we get to hear about the importance of the first post-op bowel movement, and one of her nurse's dedication to making it happen for her. <br />The former Fran Fine (her character on \\"The Nanny\\") might just be sticking a little toe into \\"too much info\\" waters here, you say? Fine. <br />She plunges right in when it comes to giving us the stories of her sex life with newfound younger beau, a former co-worker on \\"The Nanny.\\" (Relax, gossipmongers, it's none of the actors from the show. None of them apparently even bothered to send her get-well flowers, because none ofthe cast nets a mention.) <br />The BMs were gross but acceptable; however, no one wants to hear about Drescher's lack of sexual prowess or the way she and the new love of her life get it on. <br />If readers are diehard Drescherphiles, and willing to sit through her tales of poopage and heavy breathing, not to mention descriptions of childhood horror stories about the Drescher family's hospital visits and Fran's do-I-or-do-I-not-ever-want kids indecisions, then \\"Schmancer\\" gets an A. <br />The same goes for people who have found themselves perpetually cheerful for a while now, and are looking for a way to get down off the happiness. In addition to all of the heartbreak and pain already mentioned, \\"Schmancer\\" tells us how Fran's beloved dog, Chester, had to be put to sleep. <br />Here comes depression! <br />For the rest of us, this is one time Drescher was better off keeping her mouth shut.	2002-10-27

Hilarity typically ensues whenever one reads Patrick McManus.<BR> <BR>For years, Inland Northwest author McManus has regaled readers to the point of hysterical laughter with his personal essays on hunting, fishing, growing up and life is general. <BR>Titles include \\"Into the Twilight, Endlessly Grousing,\\" \\"A Fine and Pleasant Misery\\" and \\"They Shoot Canoes, Don't They?\\" <br />McManus is perhaps the most famous nonfiction author from around these parts, and several of his stories have been made into hit one-man shows. <br />All these successes are deserved. <br />The stories are dangerous to read in seemingly innocuous settings, like the breakfast table (unless you like having milk spurt out your nose) or in class (unless you love it when your teacher glares at you for laughing and causing a disruption). <br />My favorite story is \\"The Sensuous Angler,\\" in which McManus sort of flirts with the idea of adultery. ...P>Sure, \\"Bear\\" has some good chortles in it. <br />The title story is funny, if drawn out. \\"Culinary Magic\\" and \\"A Hunter's Breakfast\\" are both funny looks at the dining habits of McManus and his compatriots. There's a couple of \\"ha haw\\" moments in \\"As the Ear is Bent,\\" as we hear some of the gems ol'Pat has given his long-suffering disciple, Newton, and in \\"The Time Machine.\\" <br />Newcomers to McManus will probably find a lot to enjoy. But really, there's nothing here that we haven't seen in any of McManus' other books. And the freshness has begun to fade. <br />Hopefully, \\"Bear\\" is just representative of McManus' \\"off\\" days, and not a sign that the author is permanently slipping.	2002-10-20

He made hitchhiking a universal thing.<BR> <BR>Literally. <br />Douglas Adams, author of the five books in the vastly popular comic-space saga \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" trilogy (you did indeed read that correctly), plus an assortment of other novels, died in May 2001. <br />Now comes a posthumous collection of his writings, called \\"The Salmon of Doubt,\\" which allows his fans one last, gentle look at a revolutionary voice in literature and science-fiction. <br />\\"Salmon\\" is very much a toast to Adams, a eulogy to him. <br />The assembled writings are fabulous, culled from a massive selection of writings, letters, essays, various introductions and other things from Adams' computer. <br />The title refers to an included unfinished Dirk Gently book which, had he lived, might have turned into the sixth \\"Hitchhiker\\" book. <br />Other points of interest: <br />The first published work of twelve-year-old Douglas Adams, a letter to the editor to \\"The Eagle,\\" a popular boys' magazine. <br />\\"Y,\\" in which Adams helpfully points out that the question \\"Why?\\" is the only one important enough to have had a letter named after it. <br />\\"Riding the Rays,\\" in which Adams gets the idea to compare riding a new technological submarine, the \\"Sub Bug,\\" to riding manta rays off the coast of Manta Ray Bay near Australia, the rejection of his proposal when it comes to riding the rays and, upon discovering a manta in said bay, his ease with giving up the pursuit of a ride. Quite possibly the best entry in the whole book. <br />\\"Is There an Artificial God?\\" is an interesting speech from Adams on his aetheism, as he breaks downb his non-belief into steps and explores the contrasts between science and religion. <br />\\"Cookies,\\" in which Adams finds himself plagued by the most horrid of human entities: The cookie thief. Or does he?<br />A letter to Disney's unresponsive David Vogel leaving a chart of numbers at which Adams can possibly be reached. <br />\\"The Private Life of GenghisKhan\\": A woman whose village has just been pillaged and burnt to the ground by the Mongol now finds herself right next to him, with one of his warriors forcing her to ask the mighty Khan how his day was... <br />It is almost spooky how, in a review/essay of P.G. Wodehouse's unfinished novel \\"Sunset at Blandings,\\" Adams laments the fact that Wodehouse's final work is \\"unfinished not just in the sense that it suddenly, heartbreakingly for those of us who love this man and his work, stops in midflow, but in the more important sense that the text up to that point is also unfinished.\\" <br />Heartbreakingly stopped in midflow, unfinished? The same can be said of Adams himself.	2002-10-16

Jim Broadbent (\\"Topsy-Turvy,\\" \\"Moulin Rouge\\") brought home Oscar gold for his role of John Bayley in the movie \\"Iris.\\"<BR> <BR>With the film (also starring Dame Judi Dench in the title role, and \\"Titanic\\" star Kate Winslet playing a younger version) now available for rental, it's a good time to also check out the book upon which the movie is based. <br />\\"Elegy for Iris\\" is Bayley's heart-rending memoir of his wife, celebrated novelist Iris Murdoch (\\"A Severed Head\\" and \\"The Bell\\" among them). It is the story of Bayley and Murdoch's romance, from their first meeting and the bookish Bayley's instant attraction to the girl on a bicycle. <br />Love seemed to bloom almost immediately, despite Bayley's lack of experience and Murdoch's plethora of suitors. In fact, Bayley tells us that years later he happened upon Murdoch's note for their first date: \\"St. Antony's Dance. Fell down the steps, and seem to have fallen in love with J. We didn't dance much.\\" <br />At the same time, \\"Elegy\\" is also a tale of the modern John and Iris, as the celebrated novelist suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and her husband watches as her once brilliant mind falters.<BR> <BR>But while the book will bring tears, it isn't really a tearjerker. <br />Bayley shares some of the personal, silly little jokes he tells Iris that at one time would not really have amused either of them, but which draw a favorable reaction from her now. And the way that one of his exasperated temper tantrums settles her nerves now more than coddling will.<BR> <BR>While Bayley is at times frustrated, understandably so, he seems more enamored of his wife then ever. He marvels at the things she does, reflects on their shared past, they way her mind worked then contrasted with the way it worked as he wrote \\"Elegy\\" (Murdoch died in February). <br />At no time does Bayley seem to resent being saddled with his wife. In fact, he expresses distaste for the wife of another Alzheimer's patient when she comments that it is \\"like being chained to a corpse, isn't it?\\"<BR> <BR>No, declares Bayley, and he goes to bat for his wife. <br />\\"I was repelled by the suggestion that Iris' affliction could have anything in common with that of this jolly woman's husband. She was a heroine, no doubt, but let her be a heroine in her own style. How could our cases be compared? Iris was Iris.\\"<BR> <BR>So says a testament to quiet strength, bravery and love.	2002-09-29

Keep an eye out next time you're rooting around in your attic. <br />If you come across one of those old toys you'd get with a Happy Meal, it could be a collector's item. <br />So says \\"Fast Food Toys,\\" by Gail Pope and Keith Hammond. <br />This is an interesting and unique book that is sure to send college students across the nation into fits of nostalgia. <br />Remember the McDonald's mainstay food offerings that would transform into robots? Or, better yet, the ones that would turn into dinosaurs? <br />I haven't thought of Quarter Pounder Cheese O-Saur or Mac-O-Saurus Rex in years. And now collectors are offering three to five dollars for them. <br />My younger brother, Steven, obtained these six toy aliens from Wendy's years ago, in 1990, that he carried around with him forever. We never knew one of the characters' names, but finally, after a decade of wondering, we know the answer: <br />Crimson-oid. Yello-boid. Spotta-zoid. Lime-oid. Blu-zoid. Purpa-poid.<br />They're all in the book. Just not where we put them. But if they ever turn up, and Steven's willing to part with them, he can get three to five dollars for each one. <br />But even if you're not interested in selling, the book is worth it just to see some old friends again.<br />\\"Fast Food Toys\\" is like a trip back into time, as movie and television promotions abound. Shows like \\"Chip N' Dale Rescue Rangers,\\" \\"Kisseyfur,\\"\\"Dinosaurs\\" (\\"Not the momma!\\"), \\"Tiny Toons\\" and so much more will suddenly re-enter your consciousness like a bolt of lightning. <BR> <BR>These are the toys that were worth hassling your parents into going and getting a Happy Meal for, not the unsophisticated items being offered today.<br />Best of all, they have pictures of the plush Noid I got from Domino's. <br />Remember the Noid? Aside from a brief cameo appearance on an episode of \\"The Simpsons\\" last season, he doesn't seem to be doing too much. Here's hoping the Noid turns up next to ALF and Terry Bradshaw on the next 10-10-220 phone commercial. <br />Ah, ALF. It really is a good time to be a child of the '80s. <br />This probably sounds really nerdy, but it's exciting to see color photos of each and everything you ever got by going through the drive-thru window. <br />Turns out only the food was fast. <br />Looks like the toys are forever.	2002-09-11

That's one of the things readers will learn when they flip open \\"Coraline,\\" the latest from author Neil Gaiman (the \\"Sandman\\" comics; \\"American Gods,\\" to name a few). <br />\\"Coraline\\" is like an even more bent and twisted version of \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" There's no Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter or bottles that say \\"Drink me,\\" but the classic young-girl-finds-bizarre-danger-in-a-strange-new-world plot is still readily apparent. <br />Coraline and her parents, who ignore her, move into a new apartment. She soon goes exploring. After meeting the wacky upstairs neighbors - two gossipy old maids and an elderly gent who talks to rats - Coraline finds the door in her own place that opens into a simple brick wall. Or does it? <br />The door also opens into a creepy other realm, where strange doll-like versions of her parents have buttons for eyes and vow to never neglect her like her real parents have. The attention is sort of nice at first, but what happens when Coraline wants to go home? <br />Coraline finds assistance, if not alliance, in a smart-aleck black cat, whom she can only talk with in the other realm. <br />And the old man's rats are apparently continually discussing her adventures, providing a commentary on the action and Coraline's safety, although they never are seen by the audience. (We only get the heads up from the old guy himself, which goes to show what kind of a weird and quirky novel \\"Coraline\\" is.) <br />There's not too much to the plot, and even less that can be revealed lest we give it all away, but \\"Coraline\\" is fun, pure and simple. It's \\"Wonderland\\" gone even darker. <br />Told in the same amiable tone that made \\"Gods\\" (in which the worshiped deities of old found themselves doing battle with the new gods of technology) such a fun read, Gaiman has put together a fabulously creepy tale that teeters on the verge of childhood and adulthood. It's one more successful addition to a rapidly increasing list of impressive accomplishments.	2002-08-23

But no. <br />\\"Chins\\" is actually the title of one of the best autobiographies to come along since, well, since Leno's autobiography, \\"Leading With My Chin.\\" <br />\\"If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor,\\" is by Bruce Campbell, leading man of such B movies as \\"Evil Dead,\\" \\"Evil Dead 2\\" and \\"Army of Darkness,\\" as well as the acclaimed and dearly departed television series \\"Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\\" <br />Before this review progresses further, I must confess: Before reading the book, I had never seen any of the movies Campbell has been in, nor did I tune into \\"Brisco.\\"<br />Since then, I have seen both \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Evil Dead 2.\\"<br />But that's the beauty of the book. Even going in knowing absolutely nothing about the actor or his cult classic movies or television, I enjoyed the book immensely. <br />Campbell is an amiable storyteller, with an often dry, witty voice that's hysterical. <br />The book takes us through a childhood of peril, usually because of Campbell's scheming brothers or because of a scheme of his own design. <br />Nothing suits these boys better than games of mass destruction, elaborate plots involving army men and bottle rockets, virtually anything they can get their hands on. <br />Campbell's life kicks into high gear when he meets the Raimi brothers, one of whom - Sam, the insane one (which is saying a lot) - will end up directing him in the smash horror film \\"Evil Dead.\\" <br />Campbell describes the filming of the first movie in the \\"Evil Dead\\" series in such a way as to make one wish they had participated in it. No wait, scratch that. This is gonzo cinema at its best and most repellent, with stories of gushing blood and the required construction of special camera tools to appease the weird directing fancy of Raimi. The tales of \\"Evil Dead\\" are enough to make you want to grab your friends and go about filming your own tales of gruesome beheadings and dismemberment. <br />While giving the series that made him a star ampletime, Campbell gives other aspects of his life their due as well. But there are no tales of scandal and wanton sex (darn it) to be found here. <br />Campbell instead shows us the true life of an actor: Learning how to cry, asking for money to make movies, auditioning for roles, getting roles on syndicated series like \\"Hercules\\" and \\"Jack of All Trades,\\" watching said series' slide into cancellation, auditioning for other parts, falling in love, taking part-time jobs to keep food on the table, having children, getting divorced ... in the hands of a lesser writer, this would all be boring. <BR> <BR>Campbell's wry sense of humor carries us through. <br />There's no whining, though. Each story is like a wink from Campbell to his fans, and to those who discover him through \\"Chins.\\" <br />\\"Evil Dead\\" heads will luxuriate in the slightest of details .(See Campbell lose a glove to a raging river! See Campbell covered in bugs attracted to the sticky red liquid that stands in for blood!) <br />But for the unwashed, there is still plenty to enjoy. <br />One highlight is the chapter in which Campbell moans about his car troubles, including for his readers a check list of all the things that have gone wrong with one, and the vehicularly challenged friend to whom he lends another. <br />Another section within a chapter tells not Campbell's story, but instead the story of Ron Webber, craft services man on \\"Brisco.\\" His job title required Webber to man the food for the cast and crew, and also take care of the horse droppings on the set. <br />Talking to Webber between takes, Campbell finds out about the guy's brief appearance on an old episode of \\"Lost in Space\\" and is able to track down a copy for him, which makes for a touching scene when Campbell gives Webber the tape to keep and show his grandchildren. <br />All in all, \\"If Chins Could Kill\\" crosses the cult status boundaries into a successful book for all audiences. <br />If you weren't a Bruce Campbell fan before reading it,you will be by the time you're through.	2002-07-14

Not a college student, it would seem. \\"Read?\\" most scoff. \\"I haven't got time, what with my busy schedule, for a short story, let alone a big book that reaches nearly 700 pages in length.\\"<br />Still, somewhere out there is the rare reader who likes the challenge an epic presents, loves to get lost in fascinating, multi-layered characterizations and plots that expand over decades.<br />For those readers, there is David James Duncan's 1992 offering, \\"The Brothers K.\\" It excels on all those fronts I just mentioned, and on several more.<br />But when a friend recently handed it over to me, suggesting that I take a look, I too balked at its size:<br />\\"Look at it! Are you trying to kill any semblance of a social life I may have? This thing is mammoth and unwieldy!\\"<br />But my friend was persistent and so I went home and took a look. And soon became lost in the words, the story, the characters.<br />\\"Brothers K\\" is about the Chance family. Father Hugh is a mill worker who used to be the most promising baseball player around, until an accident at the mill cost him his dream. Mother Laura clings obsessively to her Adventist religion, since it once protected her from the darkest hour of her past.<br />Together, they have four boys and two twin girls. Everett is the oldest, a charming, witty rogue who doesn't share Laura's faith. Peter is next, and is a fellow cynic. Irwin is the large and innocent third child. Kincaid is a blank slate, who serves as the readers' eyes in the guise of the book's narrator.<br />The twin girls, Bet and Freddy, come later and more or less fulfill the role of younger sisters to the four brothers and little else, although they have a heartbreaking scene involving their grandmother's death that paves the way for the story to come full circle later.<br />Those are the characters. There is a plot, but Duncan takes it so lackadaisically and slow across the sands of time that in essence it can all be summed upin one word: Lifetime. For this is very much the saga of the Chance family, and all of their adventures therein.<br />We literally see the Chance boys grow up before our very eyes, watch as their characters age and grow, or regress, experience life and flirt with death.<br />Around halfway through the book, the four brothers (the \\"K\\" is an allusion to \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky) each go off in search of their own way; Everett becomes a draft-dodger, Peter a philosopher, Kincaid a hippie, and Irwin goes to fight in Vietnam.<br />There is no rush on Duncan's part to tell the story, and so there can be no rush from the reader to finish it.<br />For this is a book in which the getting there is very much the draw, and readers are rewarded their patience by Duncan's sense of humor, sometimes gentle, other times abrasive, many times subtle and always hilarious.<br />But if you're the sort who seeks immediate gratification and \\"lite\\" escape from your reading, \\"Brothers K\\" is told in a series of broken up chapters and chapters-within-chapters, making it easier to simply pick it up, read a section or two and then return to whatever else you were doing.<br />If you can, that is. It's a hypnotic, intoxicating read, which will make putting the book down difficult.<br />And when you finally do finish, if you're like me, you will be so moved from the whole experience you will have to leave the room and walk the book off. It's that good.<br />Upon returning to your room, of course, there will be the brand-new temptation to pick it up and start all over again.	2002-07-07

Coen brothers. <br />Just say the words, and most moviegoers can tell you what you're probably in for. <br />Crime. Criminals. Mystery. Shenanigans. <br />The same holds true for &quot;Gates of Eden,&quot; a collection of short stories by Ethan Coen, one-half of the brother team (bro is Joel Coen) that created such contemporary classics as &quot;Blood Simple,&quot; &quot;Fargo,&quot; &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; and, most recently, &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There.&quot; <br />With the short stories in &quot;Gates,&quot; Ethan displays the tendency to irresistible characters that the brothers have put to such acclaimed use in their films. <br />And characters they are. Hapless schmucks, crooks who just don't seem to have a clue, oddballs and hitmen, all of whom are destined to win your heart. Or, at the very least, your funny bone. <br />The title story is probably my favorite, simply because it examines a career that is usually shucked aside by storytellers in favor of more glamorous work: The weights-and-measures man. <br />It's Joe Gendreau's job to make sure the gas station attendant isn't overcharging for or skimping on gas; a beating with a tire iron will keep him straight. All in a day's work, ma'am. <br />Like Joe says, &quot;Standards are what make us a society. A community agrees. A gallon is a gallon. A pound is a pound. He who says fifteen ounces is a pound - he must be put down. A pound is a pound, or we go bango.&quot; <br />Sigh. Coen's use of dialogue makes me weak in the knees. Oh, to have that firm control of dialect. <br />Other faves in &quot;Gates&quot;:<br />&quot;Destiny&quot;: A knocked-out-too-often boxer agrees to take pictures of guy's wife in bed with a business associate, and ends up caught in between two gentlemen of less than civil reputation. <br />&quot;Cosa Minapolidan&quot;: Among other things, a mob boss wants a fresh stiff. But the guys he's got on the job ain't quite right in the head, if you know what I'm saying. And oneof 'em's new on the job. <br />&quot;Hector Berlioz, Private Investigator&quot;: Aside from his name, there's nothing out of the ordinary about this private investigator. Coen sets the whole story like it could be an old-fashioned radio drama, and the results are both familiar and fantastic. <br />&quot;A Fever in the Blood&quot;: Next to &quot;Eden,&quot; this is the best story in the collection. Another p.i. finds himself deaf in one ear psychologically after having the other one bitten off. Brings the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; to mind, complete with twist at the end. Perfection. <br />Anyone in need of a quick pick-me-up or an enjoyably light read can do worse than Coen. Grab your teddy bear, hunker down under the covers after (or in the middle of) a long day and thank your lucky stars you don't lead these sorry souls' lives.	2002-06-18

Chalk is to cheese as men are to women. <br />The difference between the genders is put on full display in a new novel that is grabbing the attention of the book world. <br />Susan Minot's \\"Rapture\\" finds two former lovers, Benjamin and Kay, in the midst of a reunion. <br />In a decision that explains a lot of the fervor over her book, Minot sets the entire novel within this encounter, entering the characters' heads as they have sex, in the Bill Clinton definition of the word. <br />Two bodies can hardly be closer, while two minds couldn't be further apart. <br />Kay romanticizes the encounter, and thinks about her addiction to Benjamin, how she likes all the things about him that she isn't supposed to and even telling him that her act is an act of \\"worship.\\" <br />Benjamin, meanwhile, seems distant during the whole thing, as he contemplates Vanessa, the woman he can't get out from under his skin and wonders what Kay is thinking. <br />While all of this is going on, Minot has the characters remember the chain of events that brought them together, as well as the reasons they broke up. <br />\\"Rapture\\" is a daring work, to be sure, and Minot takes her time in telling the story of Benjamin and Kay's relationship. <br />But there's something missing. We never really connect with her characters as they rendezvous. <br />Ben, in particular, seems like more of a jerk than anything for leading Kay on, and we wish Kay were not so stupid as to fall for him again. <br />Which is exactly Minot's point in showing the differences between the man and the woman, but it leaves the audience without someone to root for. <br />Still, \\"Rapture\\" is short in comparison to some of the other lengthy tomes currently rocking the literary world (Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections,\\" for instance) and can easily be digested in one setting. <br />But readers will still be hungry after finishing it.	2002-06-09

It holds its own.<br />In \\"Gods,\\" Shadow is a convict days away from his prison release. Before that can happen, however, he learns that his beloved wife, Laura, has been killed in a car crash. After his release, at her funeral, a woman spits on Laura's corpse. When confronted by Shadow, the woman reveals that Laura was having an affair with her husband, also killed in the crash.<br />His world shattered, Shadow stumbles into the employment of the mysterious Mr. Wednesday, who asks him to take on the role of occasional bodyguard, in the interest of protecting some shady dealings and interests.<br />From there, Shadow eventually comes to discover that his new employer and associates are long-forgotten gods, no longer worshipped by humankind and now doomed to live amongst their ranks.<br />Even worse, the new gods of pop culture's worship, like technology, wood and mass media, to name a few, are out to bring down the gods of yore and claim dominance.<br />Along the way, Shadow runs across a few familiar gods (very few - Gaiman has said in online interviews that one of his points was to use old mythological figures that are more obscure, so the use of Greek gods like Zeus is sort of pointless) and fantasy creatures, some of whom are given creepy new spins under Gaiman's imagination.<br />He also finds himself tormented by his dead wife, literally, when a gold coin from a leprechaun proves enough to raise her from her grave.<br />There's more to the story, of course, and Gaiman does a good job of telling it, even if things start off somewhat slow and it's hard to retain all the information he's giving. But Shadow is a great character for an audience to follow, likable enough to keep readers interested and cynical enough to give the fantastical goings-on an air of realism to them.<br />It's a fabulous, fabulous concept in theory and Gaiman has got the goods to make it live up to its fullest potential. All the elements are there, and it proves to be a book where idea and creator are well in sync.<br />The gods must be pleased.his dead wife, literally, when a gold coin from a leprechaun proves enough to raise her from her grave. <br />There's more to the story, of course, and Gaiman does a good job of telling it, even if things start off somewhat slow and it's hard to retain all the information he's giving.

Toilet reading is crucial reading. <br />It's really an age-old question: Do you read on the john? <br />If so, what do you read? <br />I have friends who take children's books into the bathroom with them. Others have been known to drag something the length of \\"War and Peace\\" in there. <br />I think one of the best offerings for when nature calls has got to be a collection of comic strips. <br />\\"Fox Trot,\\" \\"Calvin and Hobbes,\\" \\"Zits,\\" \\"Bloom County\\" - you name it, there's a collection for it. You might as well have some funny business to read. <br />Except for \\"Doonesbury.\\" With that, you're probably better off reading \\"War and Peace.\\" <br />One of the newer, and most hilarious offerings is Darby Conley's \\"Get Fuzzy\\" comic strip. <br />The strip plays like a fresher, funkier version of \\"Garfield.\\" It even has the same stock characters: Smart-aleck cat, none-too-swift dog, frazzled human owner. <br />But where the big orange cat has sadly grown stale and predictable (spider smashing, yawn; hating Mondays, been there, done that), \\"Get Fuzzy\\" has enough comedic antics to last a while. <br />The cat in question isn't an overweight lasagna-loving feline, but rather a black and white hellion named Bucky. Arguably the star of the strip, Bucky drives his roommates nuts by, really, just acting like a cat. An obnoxious cat who can speak, sure, but a cat nonetheless, as Bucky ignores them, rips the apartment apart and charges $1500 to his owner's credit card for suede sheets. <br />The role of man's best friend is filled by Satchel. But while Satchel isn't very bright, he's no moron. He does most of the cooking, and is the earnest worrywart of the group. In fact, he probably parallels Telly from \\"Sesame Street\\" more than he does Odie. The strip that best sums up Satchel is probably where he finds out his pet bug is really a peanut. That's just the way Satchel is. There's a moment of quiet reflection, and then Satchel eats the peanut.<br />Finally, the brains of the group is owner Rob. Whereas Jon Arbuckle slowly disintegrated into a foil for Garfield, Rob very much has a life. He works to feed his pets, he tries to date, he has friends. <br />Bucky goes on a three-day nap, Satchel gets rejected by the Purebred Dog Club, Rob has to go out of town and gets his dad to sit for the animals - These are just a few of the great storylines in the first collection, \\"The Dog is Not a Toy (House Rule # 4).\\"<br />In playing with the familiar formula, Conley has come up with a winning comic. <br />The only bad thing about it is that those people in the stall next to you are probably going to wonder why you're giggling.	2002-06-04

And I just scored a whole ton of points on Scrabble. <br />Ah, Scrabble. Many an evening of my life has been spent playing the famous board game, especially since coming to college. <br />Blasted college girls and their so-called \\"standards.\\" <br />But if my sex life has not improved, my vocabulary certainly has, as has the vocabulary of the people around me. <br />For instance, two of my regular Scrabble chums swear they had never heard of the word \\"moot\\" before I used it in one of our first games. Now, everything around them is \\"moot.\\" <br />And \\"Qwerty\\" is another designated (unofficial but Scrabble-friendly) name for the universal keyboard on a computer or typewriter. You know, the keys start out with the letters \\"q,\\" \\"w,\\" \\"e,\\" \\"r,\\" \\"t\\" and \\"y.\\" <br />(If one of your professors catches you reading this today in his or her class and tells you to actually learn something, explain what \\"Qwerty\\" means. Then tell him or her that the class you're attending has been rendered moot. They'll love it.) <br />If I weren't so cheap, I'd be buying all my Scrabble chums a copy of \\"Word Freak,\\" by Stefan Fatsis, who I think has the greatest authorial name since Zadie Smith came along with \\"White Teeth\\" last year. <br />Fatsis, a sports writer for The Wall Street Journal, uses \\"Word Freak\\" as a window into, as the book is subtitled, \\"Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players.\\" <br />Too often in nonfiction, there will come along a book with a clever concept that turns out to be an absolute snooze in reading. ... good for your coffee table but not much else. <br />\\"Word Freak\\" is painstaking in its Scrabble coverage. Actual information is peppered all the more by Fatsis' fascination with the game, and with other players' obsession with the game. <br />We start out with Scrabble players in the park and are eventually introduced to actual fanatics of the game. Kudos to Fatsis for not hiding behind a \\"names were changed to protect anybody\\" façade, and actually calling the people involved by name. <br />There's Matt, the drug-addicted high school dropout who is just mad crazy about anagrams (he can mix up a word's letters alphabetically in a matter of seconds, like \\"ABDEILMORSTUXY\\" and \\"ABCEGHILNOPRTUY,\\" which of course unscramble into \\"ambidextrously\\" and \\"uncopyrightable\\"). <br /> <BR>There's Joe Edley, for quite a while an unbeaten champion and the \\"ultimate Scrabble swami,\\" and one of many to take Fatsis under his wing. <br />There's Lester, an old radical and former champ. Lester's chapter opens the door to introduce Don, a homeless man and former player in the Nationals tournament ... <br />And along the way, Fatsis himself becomes more and more obsessed with the game, memorizing word lists, playing anagram games and struggling to increase his own puny Scrabble score. <br />If this book doesn't become some sort of unofficial Scrabble player's bible, I'll eat my hat. Fatsis literally doesn't leave a stone unturned, venturing back into the board game's history and providing a comprehensive (but not boring) profile of its creator Alfred Butts, and even uncovering an obscure board game with a concept similar to Scrabble's. <br />All kidding aside, \\"Word Freak\\" is a very interesting, unique book that would make a great holiday gift for the deserving Scrabble fan on your Christmas list, and an interesting novelty for anybody else. <br />You might want to cross-reference it with a dictionary, though.	2002-06-04

Lately, Stephen King has been better in short spurts.<br />With the exception of \\"Black House,\\" his reunion with \\"Talisman\\" co-author Peter Straub, any lengthy writing by King (\\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\\" \\"On Writing,\\" \\"Dreamcatcher\\") has been measured and found wanting.<br />Even King himself appears to recognize this, having made noise of an eventual retirement, after releasing at least five more books.<br />One of those books is \\"Everything's Eventual,\\" a collection of short stories. And judging by \\"Eventual,\\" King might want to abandon his lengthier novels to write short stories full time.<br />Here is a way for King to do what he does best, tell stories, without having to suffer through all the trappings a novel might be expected to do.<br />With a short story, King can pop in, set the stage for an event, do the event, and then pop out and on to other things.<br />This is win-win for the reader, too. If one story looks like it's going the way of \\"Insomnia\\" (snore), then you can skip ahead to stuff that's more along the lines of \\"It.\\"<br />It's a medium that seems to suit him a hell of a lot better.<br />The title story itself isn't the greatest, a confusing tale about a young man who finds himself in possession of something like a whiteboard that anything he writes will come true, and under the employ of a mysterious gentleman.<br />But there are a couple goodies to be discovered.<br />Introduction: I keep failing to mention just how much I enjoy King when he is just being King, and talking to us, his Constant Readers, about what it is he does. Sometimes, the intros are better than the books.<br />\\"1408\\": The story, one of three from King's audio collection of \\"Blood and Smoke,\\" of a man who makes a living staying in rooms and houses that are supposedly haunted and then writes about it. But 1408 of the Hotel Dolphin definitely isn't \\"supposedly\\" haunted.<br />\\"Lunch at the Gotham Café\\": A maitre' d at the café in question goes postal, right as Steve Davis is meeting with his wife and her lawyer to discuss a divorce. Also from \\"Blood and Smoke.\\"<br />\\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\": A small prequel to King's ubernovel, the \\"The Dark Tower\\" series Roland the gunslinger finds himself beset by creepy green people, and under the care of witches. Really good overall, but especially for those who can't wait for the next installment of the Dark Tower saga, \\"The Wolves of Calla.\\"<br />\\"Autopsy Room Four\\": The best in the book hits us right off the gate. A man wakes up paralyzed from a snake bite with doctors prepared to do to him all the things they do to dead people. It's probably my favorite, and will have any reader spell-bound.	2002-05-09

Which would win in a fight?<br />A bear, or a shark?<br />What if we set them up in the ultimate level playing field -  water deep enough for a shark, but shallow enough for a bear - and let them go at it?<br />That's the main concept in \\"Bear V. Shark: The Novel,\\" by Chris Bachelder. <br />I think.<br />Or maybe it's not.<br />See, that's the thing about Bachelder's book. It's so complex and intricate that you might think you know what it's about, but you're probably wrong.<br />The real hero of the book is Mr. Norman (maybe), a father in an \\"American Beauty\\" -style suburban family who feels incomplete in a world full of rampant commericalism. (We first meet Mr. Norman as he snuggles up to his vibrating pillow, not available in stores, order today.)<br />Mr. Norman packs up his family and moves them to Las Vegas to watch the Bear V. Shark fight, part II. Apparently the simulation of the animals the first go-round (real animals would look too fake) left the bear's head looking so big, and created such a fervor that similar match-ups are happening across the country. Among them: Owl v. Deer, Squid v. Monkey, Scorpion v. Pigeon, Hitler v. Elvis<br />\\"Bear V. Shark\\" is an oddball commentary on our life and times, our quest for entertainment, our search for meaning and substance, the way our society works.<br />It's heavy stuff presented in a light style that's presented in a mixture of stream of consciousness, social commentary and grocery list.<br />In other words, it's a marriage of completely unrelated things all thrown together, and the results are flawless.	2002-04-24
US	50920512	R3N0GV714VM5CC	0802134661	675880526	Blue Movie	Books	4	3	9	N	Y	More interesting for its 1970s mindset than anything else.	X-rated movies could be respectable. That was the thinking of the late, legendary director Stanley Kubrick when he went to work on the last movie before his death, the R-rated \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\" <br />\\"Eyes\\" remains both intriguing and perplexing to me, mostly because it turned out to be such a mess. Like Jay Leno said, it was probably the only movie where the nudity was confusing. <br />What was the point? <br />Tom Cruise had sex with his then-wife, didn't have sex with two women at a party, didn't have sex with a prostitute, didn't have sex with the daughter of a patient, didn't have sex with the daughter of a shop owner, didn't have sex at an orgy, didn't have sex with the prostitute's roommate, and so on and so forth. <br />I watched this flick with a couple friends and when it was over, one of them said, \\"I didn't go to the bathroom, I didn't go get a drink. I didn't leave the room, and I still don't know what was going on!\\" <br />Since \\"Shut\\" came out three years ago (my God, how time flies), I've tracked down the translation of the book upon which it was based (Arthur Schnitzler's \\"Traumnovelle,\\" or, \\"Dream Novel\\"), as well as a screenwriter's Kubrickian memoir of the work on \\"Shut\\" (\\"Eyes Wide Open,\\" by Frederic Raphael). <br />I remain confused. <br />But recently, I heard about another book that might shed a little light on the subject: Terry Southern's 1970 novel, \\"Blue Movie.\\" <br />Southern, the screenwriter behind Kubrick's 1964 comedic masterpiece \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" wrote \\"Blue Movie\\" as his imagining of the director's desire to do an X-rated picture with huge celebrities and fantastic, artful lighting and cinematic breakthroughs. <br />Otherwise short on Kubrickian insights, Southern dedicates the work \\"for the great Stanley K.,\\" and even has two characters who could be fictional versions the K-man. One is celebrated director King B., or Boris, who is looking for the next thing to astound audiences with; the other is weaselly producer Sid Krassman.<br />Hollywood of the 1960s gets satirically skewered, as Sid and Boris get it in their heads to do exactly what Kubrick dreamed: Make a pornographic film (a blue movie) with celebrities and cinematic triumphs, one that will be shocking to and maybe even respected by the industry. <br />What follows is explicitly graphic madness. The game plan is to make \\"The Faces of Love,\\" an episodic movie about the different kinds of love. <br />As a hot-shot screenwriter character sums them up, idyllic, profane, lesbian, incestuous, sadism, masochism, nymphomania ... in case you didn't figure it out from the opening line of this review, this is not a novel for the genteel. (A customer review on Amazon.com ponders, is this book the dirtiest ever written?)<br />Big name stars are called in, and the technical, ahem, kinks are worked out, although trouble is always just around the bend. <br />Both Sid and Boris are never really fully realized; they mostly plot their movie or (more often) how to get their actresses into the sack. Southern stretches them as far as they will go, but that's not a great distance. <br />The most intriguing character is Tiny Marie, a loudmouthed, profanity-spewing midget who runs around on the set of Sid's other X-rated films. But even she is only semishocking in this day and age. Southern does have some rather eye-opening moments, but it fails to be earth shattering. <br />The story's all right, but what really makes \\"Blue Movie\\" so interesting and worthwhile is the way it's so ahead of its time. (Perhaps one day, a movie based on \\"Blue Movie\\" will be made.) <br />Many of the things Southern talks about and portrays as film taboos (as they were in back in 1970) have come true, and rampant even on television. The technical aspects of porn, full-fledged female nudity, oral sex É Entertainment Weekly magazine even recently ran an article on how some legitimate foreign flicks were showing actors having actual sex. It just goes to show how far the American mindset has come. <br />Depending on your interests and beliefs, this can be either a good thing or a bad thing. <br />In the end, Kubrick might have been much better off making a movie out of \\"Blue Movie.\\" The characters and their motivations are much clearer, and one doesn't require Cliffs Notes or anything in order to get through the book. <br />At the very least, here the nudity makes sense.<br />And in the end, that's really all I ask.	2002-02-03

And this time, he's brought a friend along for the ride.<br />After some lackluster offerings (\\"Bag of Bones,\\" \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\\" \\"On Writing,\\" \\"Dreamcatcher\\") King, along with fellow \\"Talisman\\" author Peter Straub, has returned to the forum and form of storytelling where he does his best work. <br />Make no mistake: This is not \\"Insomnia\\" caliber writing. Thank God. This is classic King, the stuff which \\"The Shining,\\" \\"It,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" \\"Misery\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\" are made of. At long last. Ironic that it's only once he starts working with Straub again that the Stephen King renowned worldwide shows his face ... <br />\\"Black House\\" is the sequel to Straub and King's last team-up, \\"The Talisman,\\" and revisits that book's young hero Jack Sawyer 20 years later. With no recollection of his epic, almost fairy tale adventure as a 12-year-old, Jack now is a retired detective whose claim to fame is his leading a serial killer to justice almost by magical intuition. <br />The town in which Jack resides, French Landing, faces a new threat: A serial killer known as the Fisherman, who kidnaps town children and - get this - eats them. The police chief wants Jack on the case, but he's resisting. <br />As chilling a beginning as \\"Black House\\" has, things really get exciting once it's revealed that the killer dwells from the Territories, the other realm in which Jack saved the world so many years ago. The forces of evil (including a demonic being masquerading as an Alzheimer's patient in a retirement center and a death-bringing raven named Grog), are out in full force, and this time, Jack might not turn out to be so lucky. <br />One of the characters who deserves stand-out attention is Henry Leyden, who is almost magical in and of himself. A blind radio-show host, Leyden has many on-air personalities, especially the ultra-popular and mysterious George Rathbun. Alternately mystical and endearing, Henry is a throwback to other classic King characters. He's a cool one, and audiences will love him. <br />If it seems like Straub gets the short end of the credit stick here, that's not the intention of this review. Both authors are on the top of their game, so good that it's impossible to tell which author wrote what point in the book. (Even the authors find themselves unable to tell.) <br />But this is a King novel, make no doubt about it, as we are getting ever closer to that Ultimate S.K. Novel. Straub himself suggested connecting \\"Black House\\" to the Dark Tower, a Publishers Weekly interview in the press packet information reveals: <br />0\\"It was my idea to incorporate it,\\" Straub said. \\"One reason is that I wanted to know what that stuff was. I had no idea what a `Breaker' was, what the Tower was, what the Crimson King was. `The Talisman' is all but a Dark Tower book. When I suggested it to Steve, he said, `I'm glad you said that, because I don't know if I can keep it out. At this point, everything I write is connected to it.'&quot; <br />So the Dark Tower is still a ways off in the distance, it appears. But, thanks to Straub,  \\"Black House\\" gets eager readers ever closer to that world. The answers are coming, and if this latest book, available in stores Saturday, is any indication, the trip getting there is going to be one heck of a ride...	2002-01-07

Now here's some reading material to get really excited about.<br />Lawrence Block, best known for his mystery series, especially the ones revolving around private investigator Matthew Scudder and thief Bernie Rhodenbarr, also is the editor of the June 2001 compilation of short stories entitled \\"Speaking of Lust.\\"<br />What really makes you stand at attention is the fact that \\"Lust\\" is the first in a series of short story collections that focuses on the seven deadly sins - greed, sloth, pride, envy, wrath and gluttony are the others, for those who skipped \\"Seven.\\" <br />Do you realize what this means? At some point, there's going to be a collection of short stories devoted to fat people! And another about those lazy bones that simply refuse to get out of bed. Sigh ... at last, my kind of people get their time in the spotlight.<br />Seriously, I don't know why this type of thing hasn't been done before. Kudos go to Block and whomever is helping him in this infinitely clever maneuver for making lust, everyone's favorite deadly sin, the focus of the first book, which is smart for two reasons. One, because everyone likes lust, it'll be sure to grab the most readers. And now they've got their work cut out for them in finding clever stories that will give the other six the same kind of attention.<br />If \\"Lust\\" is any indication, we're in for a treat when the presumably-titled \\"Speaking of Gluttony\\" and \\"Speaking of Wrath\\" come out. It offers a fabulous array of stories that range from delightfully sinful to shockingly sexy.<br />Among the best offerings: <br />* James W. Hall's \\"Crack,\\" about a man who discovers a crack in the wall that peeks into the neighbor's bathroom and allows him to spy on their 15-year-old daughter.<br />* \\"Ro Erg,\\" by Robert Weinberg, about a man who uses a credit card error to create a whole new persona for himself.<br />*Ed Gorman's \\"The End of It All,\\" in which a once hideous monstrosity gets made over into the handsomest man on earth, and prepares to seduce his high school crush ... and her daughter ...<br />* \\"The Girls in Villa Costas,\\" by Simon Brett, about a machinating womanizer who finds himself torn between a beautiful woman and her less-attractive-but-stands-to-inherit-the-family-fortune sister.<br />Aside from introducing and editing the book, Block also writes the title novella. It is here that another reading delight emerges, and in his introduction Block promises that subsequent tales using the same characters will follow in the future books.<br />Most likely using Chaucer's \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" as a model (Did anyone else enjoy reading this classic in high school? After all, those stories about white whales, scarlet letters and tales about two cities, this classic had farting and people having sex in orange trees! Finally, some decent reading material!), Block's story is really just several people - a priest, a policeman, a doctor, a soldier and an old guy - sitting around playing cards and talking about the ways lust has affected their occupations and lives. Lively discussion and debates ensue. <br />It's an ingenious way to go about telling the story, and the stories within the story will have the reading audience on the edge of their seats (pay close attention to the priest's tale).<br />Best of all, the stories are relatively short, so even if there comes the rare offering that doesn't quite tickle your funnybone, you can skip it guilt free and go on to the next treasure.<br />Reading about sin probably wasn't meant to be this much fun. But, oh, how sweet it is.	2002-01-05

Up on my soapbox again.<br />Soap operas intrigue me as an industry. They, I feel, are one of the few storytelling channels where it is possible to show an event, and the fallout from said event, for years. Some of the stories currently showing on daytime dramas today got their start more than a decade ago, and viewers have seen every step along the way!<br />That's why it's frustrating that the people currently in charge of most soap operas today don't have a clue as to what they're doing, and are using gimmicks to draw in viewers rather than utilizing their show's rich histories and coming up with character-based storylines. (A primary example of this kind of storyline is ABC's lineup, which is a real mess right now.)<br />And that's why it's exciting when a soap pauses to mine its heritage and tell storylines that will both draw in new viewership, and please people who've been tuning in since day one at the same time. (The shining example of this is currently CBS' \\"As the World Turns.\\")<br />However, the soap that's really catching the eye of the entertainment industry right now is NBC's \\"Passions.\\" Interesting that the show is doing everything I talked about above, when it only began to air in 1999.<br />\\"Passions\\" has had a feature article in Entertainment Weekly magazine, and was on the cover of TV Guide in July, proof that it's taking off. Part of this, I will admit, is because of the bizarre stories the show is telling, what with trips to hell, angel girls and living dolls and all.<br />But at its heart, all this hype just reflects the fact that \\"Passions\\" is using past history to enrich what's on screen right now, and fans are tuning in in droves.<br />In the spring, NBC sought to cash in on the growing soap's mania and released a book, \\"Hidden Passions: Secrets from the Diaries of Tabitha Lenox.\\" Written by romance novelist Alice Alfonsi and using \\"Passions\\" creator/head writer James E. Reilly's bible for the show, \\"Hidden Passions\\" is a window to the pastso that eager readers can make sense of some of the current mysteries.<br />The book is the diary of Tabitha (played by Juliet Mills on the soap), a 200-year-old witch who's been living for centuries in the show's setting, a New England town called Harmony (even though life in Harmony is anything but harmonious). Peppered with little comments from Tabitha's living doll, Timmy (Josh Ryan Evans), the book describes life in Harmony twenty years ago.<br />Well-to-do Ivy (Kim Johnston Ulrich) loves middle class pizza boy Sam (James Hyde), but forces (namely, Tabitha) are working to keep them apart. Ivy is to be paired with town scoundrel Julian Crane (Ben Masters), at the wishes of her dad and of Julian's machinating father, Alistair (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer, he of Skeletor-voicing fame). But Julian is intoxicated by jazz singer Eve (Tracey Ross), who is about to fall in love with Sam's best friend and Julian's tennis rival, T.C. (Rodney van Johnson)<br />Fans of the show know that, ultimately, Sam and Ivy share one last night (right after she marries Julian!), which ultimately produces Ethan (Travis Shuldt), who was raised as a Crane heir until the eve of his marriage to Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald (Lindsey Korman), daughter of Ivy's maid Pilar (Eva Tamargo Lemus), while Julian and Eve's tryst may or may not have produced Chad (Donn Swaby), who is currently wooing both Eve's daughters.<br />Confused? Try re-reading the last two paragraphs a couple of times. It'll all sink in eventually ...<br />You see? Intricacies like this don't spring up over night! It takes planning, and sometimes decades of secrets to make something really viable, and only soaps have the power. \\"Hidden Passions\\" enhances the current fan's viewing, and will intrigue many more to start watching. (I know I'm tempted to set my VCR ...)<br />I particularly like the idea that Tabitha has been a thorn in Harmony's side for quite some time. (As those in the know know, Tabitha and sidekick Timmy are the show's breakout characters and the biggest daytime draw since Luke and Laura.) Tabby's diary takes us back to the early settler years, and explains Tabitha's hatred for Grace Standish Bennett (Dana Sparks) and her niece Charity (Molly Stanton), as well as a long-standing grudge against the Cranes. We also get to see that current supercouple Sheridan Crane (Mackenzie Westmore) and Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald (Galen Gering) are meant to be, even they've spent several past lives trying to be together.<br />But I'm happiest that \\"Hidden Passions\\" reveals a little bit of the motivation behind Alistair Crane. On the show, Alistair's face is never seen. All we see of the man is his hands, and body from the neck down, while he plots to kill daughter Sheridan and endulges in an assortment of odd hobbies and crafts. (Why kill Sheridan? Now we know ...) <br />Alistair is intriguing, in part because he's never completely seen, and partly because of Oppenheimer, continuing my Skeletor fascination.<br />That, and the fact that \\"Alistair Crane\\" is a really cool name and fun to say, although most of the characters' names roll off the tongue.<br />Alistair Crane Alistair Crane Alistair Crane Alistair Crane...<br />So check out the book and check out the show.

For all those out there who just asked, \\"Who the heck is Michael Malone?\\" I shall tell you. <br />You mean you don't know?! Pfft. Michael Malone is only one of the greatest storytellers currently on the planet. <br />He's written such fine literary works as \\"Foolscap,\\" \\"Handling Sin,\\" \\"Dingley Falls,\\" \\"Time's Witness,\\" \\"Uncivil Seasons\\" and the Edgar Award-winning short story \\"Red Clay.\\" <br />What's that? \\"Never heard of `em?\\" <br />All right then, maybe you're familiar with Malone's head writer work on the soap opera \\"One Life to Live.\\" His creations of such groundbreaking characters as tortured minister Andrew Carpenter? Slick con-man David Vickers? Southern belle Blair Cramer? Mystic heroine Luna Moody? Rapist Todd Manning, the ultimate soap antihero? <br />No? <br />Sigh ... one day that medium is going to be reworked so it gets (and deserves) recognition and not ridicule. <br />Anyway, it doesn't matter that you've never heard of Malone in the past. Right now is the perfect time to get to know him for the first time, with his original books being reissued to find a new audience.<br />Plus, there's a new Malone book just released, after a decade's absence, entitled \\"First Lady.\\" And it's more than enough to make you become a diehard fan for life. <br />Set in the troubled town of Hillston, North Carolina; \\"First Lady\\" focuses on two beleaguered members of the Hillston police force at probably the lowest points of their lives. <br />Lt. Justin Savile V (the Fifth) is currently mourning the sudden death of his infant son and estranged from his beloved wife, while Police Chief Cuddy Mangum is wrestling with the fact that the love of his life married a crooked politician.<br />Right now, the press is none too happy with Justin and Cuddy, as the town is under attack by a serial killer. Deemed the Guess Who Killer because of his m.o., there doesn't appear to be any end in sight. Obscure clues turn up to torment our heroes, but are indecipherable until it's too late. No one is safe, and everyone is restless. <br />Add on to the conflict the fact that sexy rock star Mavis Mahar is in town, making eyes at the very willing Justin, and possibly next in line on the Guess Who Killer's victims list (with a smoking affair with aforementioned crooked politician to boot), and you've got a sizzling scorcher of a novel. <br />If you had been a soap opera fan, and watched \\"One Life\\" during his run, you'd have picked up on the fact that Malone is very dedicated to characters first, and letting the storylines expand from there. <br />\\"First Lady\\" operates in a similar fashion, with a good voice that takes its time in unwinding but will hook readers in the meanwhile. <br />It's a fabulous introduction, especially since some of Malone's other books can be seen as stuffy and literary at first glance, and leaves the reader hungry for more. Cuddy and Justin also appear in the earlier \\"Uncivil Seasons\\" and \\"Time's Witness,\\" and after reading \\"First Lady,\\" the opportunity to find out what was going in those books is mighty tempting. <br />With Malone's reissues in full swing, now is a good time to get acquainted with a contemporary master.	2001-12-24

I first saw Simon Garfield's \\"Mauve\\" in Spokane. The subtitle, \\"How one man invented a color and changed the world,\\" intrigued me, and I went through great pains to order it from the Spokane library system in order to take a closer look.<br />I shouldn't have wasted my time. Garfield gets an \\"A\\" for subject matter and concept, but a \\"C\\" for lousy execution.<br />On one hand, \\"Mauve\\" is the biography of William Perkin, a young chemistry student who accidentally discovers the ability to manufacture colors to dye materials, not just by using natural elements. Garfield trips up in this aspect of the book by including virtually every person Perkin came into contact with on the trip to making mauve a household color, which isn't very interesting to slog through. <br />What's more, the reader is left wondering what could possibly come next when Perkin (I hope I'm not giving anything away here) dies, and there are still a significant number of pages still unturned.<br />No real biographical details are given, save for the usual birth, marriages and children information. There's nothing to endear Perkin to us; nothing to make us think, \\"What a fascinating life this man had! I must keep reading so as not to miss a moment!\\" Perkin discovered a color the world had never seen, and ultimately changed industries all over. Other than that single intriguing fact, he did not lead the kind of life most people are anxious to read about.<br />Which brings us to the other half of \\"Mauve,\\" which is literally the biography of the color itself, how it caught on and the ensuing Beanie Baby-like craze over it in the early years, dubbed \\"mauve measles\\" by smart-alecky journalists. This is more interesting (especially the bit about Napoleon's wife kicking the mauve trend off) but, alas, it becomes lost as Garfield gets swept up in the more mundane and boring scientific bits, which are sure to thrill any diehard fan of textiles and manufacturing, but will put the rest of us to sleep.<br />Hiddengem, however: On page 164 of \\"Mauve\\" there lies the word \\"polyoxybenzylmethyllenglycolanhydride,\\" which impresses me, as it is even longer than \\"ethyltetrahydroanthrahydroquinone.\\" (Hey, simple pleasures for simple people.)<br />The most interesting part of \\"Mauve\\" comes at the end in Garfield's afterword, and it belies everything \\"Mauve\\" could have, or should have, been: \\"On (Garfield's) visits to Imperial College it was apparent how slender was the connection between the current batch of ambitious chemistry students and their Victorian predecessors. The future was too exciting to look back... but they wrote their thesis on blueberry iMacs, photographed their friends on one-use Kodaks, sprayed themselves with Calvin Klein and masked their headaches with aspirin. Their clothes were not all black; some of them wore blue, green, even yellow. And they walked around as if these colours were the most natural thing in the world.\\"<br />Too bad Garfield never lets the irony nor his wonder at the whole thing shine through. It's a glorious ending to an otherwise dull textbook wannabe.	2001-12-24

Writer's block happens.<br />Joseph Heller apparently knew it well. Before his 1999 death, the famed author of &quot;Catch-22&quot; put his frustrations into fiction, resulting in 2000's &quot;A Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man,&quot; recently released in paperback format.<br />The story is ingenious, and perhaps eeriely autobiographical. Aging author Eugene Pota (how clever is Heller? Pota = P.O.T.A., or Portrait Of The Artist) is struggling to write his next novel. We, as readers, get to see his latest attempts in action.<br />They range from a modern day re-telling of Tom Sawyer, a story told from the viewpoint of a gene, a re-telling of a mythological story, another re-telling of a biblical story, and so on. Pota gets a few pages written, but ultimately rejects each one for a variety of reasons (too much research required, it's been done to death, ludicrous concept). <br />Oh sure, there's the appealing notion of penning a sex book. People will coo and wink naughtily at parties, especially when you reveal your title: &quot;A Sexual Biography of My Wife.&quot; (Your wife, in this case Eugene's wife Polly, on the other hand, is none too thrilled.) But when the title is all you've got, well...<br />Here Heller presents a scarily realistic view of the horrors of writer's block, and proves he has perhaps the only sure-fire method of alleviating it: Write about your writer's block.<br />In the midst of doing exactly that, Heller presents a three-dimensional figure in Pota. The book lives up to its title, as Eugene feels his age and struggles to capture a glimmer of what he once had. (&quot;Catch-22,&quot; anyone?) &quot;Portrait&quot; is very much a story of an artist struggling to keep a grip on his craft, as it is the only thing he has left. It also provides an appealing look into the artist's creative process, and hints as to what was running through Heller's mind while penning his other works, like &quot;Something Happened,&quot; &quot;God Knows&quot; and &quot;Picture This.&quot;<br />Also deserving of praise is the way Heller captures the characters of Pota and Polly. Eugene is a man struggling to keep busy and recapture his former glory, which also includes looking in on a couple ex-lovers and old flames, of which there are many. While not quite as three-dimensional as her husband, we see little glimpses of Polly's motivation. And one wonders how the Heller marriage fared in his waning years; if the Potas are as autobiographical as the rest of the novel seems to be, theirs was a marriage that had sunken into mutual distaste and even a hint of hatred brought upon by old age. It's disturbing to behold.<br />It's a relatively short work, one that doesn't even come close to approaching the magnitude of &quot;Catch-22.&quot; Which is exactly Heller's point, and makes &quot;Portrait&quot; all the more breathtaking. This a cautionary tale, both envy-inspiring and frightening to aspiring writers (I tremble as I type this), and a work that could have, in all honesty, probably been written by any struggling poet with a title but no song.<br />But Heller is the one who wrote it, and he can rest easy in the knowledge that anyone else who dares attempt such a tale will merely be following in his giant footsteps.	2001-07-14
US	50920512	R1VAQDBQUKM67A	0375506276	990748107	The Fourth Hand	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Quintessential Irving.	Five thumbs way, way up for &#8220;The Fourth Hand.&#8221;<br />This one I&#8217;d been waiting for for a while. John Irving is a remarkable storyteller. However, his books (&#8220;The World According to Garp,&#8221; &#8220;A Prayer for Owen Meany,&#8221; &#8220;The Cider House Rules&#8221; and &#8220;A Widow For One Year&#8221; among them) require a great deal of patience, as the typical Irving novel usually spans decades. But for those willing to sit down and open one up, it&#8217;s really worth it.<br />Irving specializes in dynamic characters who will win your heart. And why shouldn&#8217;t they? In many a case the reader is able to see Irving&#8217;s creations grow from infancy into adulthood. You don&#8217;t stay with anyone for that long without getting attached.<br />Another specialty of Irving&#8217;s is his tendency to delve into the twisted, weird and bizarre while tackling such heavy-handed issues as rape, death, abortion, sex, incest, sex, sex-change operations, sex, religion, and a lot more sex. Dare I mention the almost infamous scene in &#8220;Garp,&#8221; in which a young man gets his .... bitten off during a car accident? Or one character&#8217;s love affair with a woman in a bear suit in &#8220;The Hotel New Hampshire&#8221;?<br />But these scenes aren&#8217;t gratuitously thrown in for the shake of shocking and scaring away the genteel. At the heart of each Irving novel (with the possible exception of &#8220;Son of the Circus&#8221;; who knows what Irving was thinking when he penned that stinker?) is the question &#8220;What if?&#8221; And issues and scenes like those mentioned above are par for the course in getting the story told.<br />&#8220;What if a nurse&#8217;s young son grows up to be a semi-famous, lust-filled writer and overprotective family man?&#8221; (&#8220;Garp.&#8221;) <br />&#8220;What if a midget with a fixed larynx who talks IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS befriends a town orphan and they grow up together, contemplating God, Liberace, the identity of the orphan&#8217;s true father and everything in between?&#8221; (&#8220;Owen Meany.&#8221;)<br />&#8220;The Fourth Hand,&#8221; released in July, is no exception. Here, Irving asks the question, &#8220;What if the wife of a hand transplant donor demands visitation?&#8221;<br />Patrick Wallingford is a handsome, playboy news reporter who, in the blink of an eye and an extremely gruesome scene, loses his left hand in an accident involving hungry lions. Over time, word comes in from a woman who would like to give him her husband&#8217;s hand. The thing is, the husband isn&#8217;t dead yet&#8230; and I really shouldn&#8217;t say anything more.<br />Suffice it to say, &#8220;Fourth Hand,&#8221; while not quite as large in scope, is Irving business as usual. There are scenes of freakish nature, there are scenes of weird sex (Patrick is seduced by a mourning widow, Patrick seduces a gum-chewing makeup girl), and there&#8217;s a storyline involving Dr. Zajac, Patrick&#8217;s hand doctor. Zajac scares us at first because he makes it look like Irving is revisiting &#8220;Son of the Circus&#8221; territory, but we are ultimately disappointed because while Zajac is an incredibly likable character, as are his undernourished son and smitten housekeeper, that storyline ultimately goes nowhere.<br />In the end, &#8220;The Fourth Hand&#8221; celebrates Irving at his best: Bizarre, yes, but a gifted and truthful storyteller as well. It&#8217;s not on the same level as \\"Garp\\" and \\"Owen,\\" but it deserves to sit on the shelf beside them.<br />So put your hands together, there&#8217;s a genius at work.	2001-07-14

I'm right.<br />&quot;The Stephen King Universe&quot; is not so much a companion piece to King's writings as it is an examination of the links between his fiction. &quot;Universe&quot; operates on the theory that King is working on a meganovel that will ultimately tie his previous works together, using the penultimate King tale, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series.<br />Wiater and company uncover connections between books that you'd never suspect existed (Cujo may pop up in &quot;Needful Things,&quot; while a character in &quot;Misery&quot; may have known someone from &quot;It&quot; as a child, to name just two).<br />Everything (novel, short story, screen adaptation, e-book) before &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; is examined in depth, while the histories of popular King towns like Derry, `salem's Lot and Castle Rock are written out in a grand fashion. A character mention here, a throwaway line there - they take on more meaning in &quot;Universe.&quot;<br />The authors of the book also compile nifty thumbnail sketches of key characters in the novels. From &quot;It&quot;:<br />IT (aka MR. BOB GRAY, PENNYWISE THE CLOWN): &quot;...In 1958, It is confronted and defeated by a group of small children calling themselves the Losers Club... In 1985, It is apparently killed by the Losers Club, now adults. It may still be alive, however.&quot;<br />The whole book is a must-have for King fans, and those interested in looking more closely at his works. The authors' obvious enthusiasm for the author shines through, and is contagious. It's the kind of in-depth examination typically reserved for that which is consider a literary classic. The only difference is that this is something everyone can enjoy.<br />And if you're still not convinced that the Ultimate Stephen King Novel is on the way, consider this quote from the Man himself about &quot;Dark Tower&quot; heroic gunslinger Roland, which appears on the back cover of &quot;Universe&quot;:<br />&quot;I am coming to understand that Roland's world actually contains all the others of my making.&quot;	2001-06-14

Pennywise lives.<br />If you walk away from &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; - Stephen King's first novel after his 1999 hit-and-run accident - holding nothing else, hold on to that.<br />Pennywise, of course, was the supernatural clown villain who stalked &quot;The Losers Club,&quot; a band of childhood misfits in what is arguably King's penultimate thriller, &quot;It.&quot; Pennywise was ultimately vanquished by the kids, their adult selves and (as &quot;It,&quot; which began so grandly, sputtered to an uneven finale) a mystical turtle.<br />Right smack dab in the middle of &quot;Dreamcatcher,&quot; however, one of King's characters stumbles across the message with which this review begins: Pennywise lives. Whether or not it actually proves to be true, however, remains to be seen...<br />It's a little moment, completely unrelated to the entire &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; story and one you might miss if you blink, or are not well versed in King lore. But it's enough to further fuel my theory that something big ultimately is going to go down in the Stephen King kingdom, tying together all of his major works, if not all his works. (This theory is given further support by the new book &quot;The Stephen King Universe,&quot; copyrighted May 2001.)<br />The possible Pennywise revival might be the most exciting thing &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; has to offer, unfortunately. Oh, it starts out well enough (King's strengths are typically his beginnings; some endings still need work), with a quartet of boyhood friends reuniting for their annual hunting trip.<br />A mysterious visitor named McCarthy, who smells really rank and unleashes a mixture of foul stenches and odors upon the cabin, interrupts the festivities. It's not very long before readers are caught up in a tale that greatly resembles something like &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers,&quot; leaving two men dead and two in a very precarious situation.<br />Woven into this present-day tale is a story of the boys as children (opening the line for discussion of further parallels to &quot;It&quot;) and their remarkable friendship with a boy with Down syndrome named Duddits. The question is, how does Duddits' influence affect the present-day goings-on surrounding McCarthy?<br />If this were all &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; were to include, it would be heralded as King's return to true horror after lackluster offerings like &quot;Insomnia,&quot; &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and &quot;On Writing.&quot; The story is creepy enough, and contains some of the best elements of King's fiction, a throwback to &quot;It,&quot; &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;The Stand.&quot; <br />But King decides to play like Tom Clancy and builds another story arc around the military officers tracking McCarthy, which drags on way too long and makes the book much heavier than it actually needs to be.<br />When you get to page 431 and see the chapter entitled &quot;The Chase Begins,&quot; for instance, and realize there's still a long way to go, it's enough to make you want to cry.<br />That, or shake the book up and down and scream, &quot;Send in the clown!&quot;	2001-05-27

I anticipated trouble when I picked up &quot;Cloudsplitter.&quot; Its length would suggest a massive epic, something along the lines of Pynchon's &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; or Smiley's &quot;Horse Heaven.&quot;<br />I shouldn't have worried. Russell Banks is nothing if not an approachable storyteller.<br />&quot;Cloudsplitter&quot; isn't my favorite of Banks' books (that distinction goes to &quot;Affliction&quot;), but it is near the top five. The story of abolitionist John Brown gets told from the fictional viewpoint of Brown's real-life son Owen, who is every bit a Banks protagonist, and who fits in well with Wade Whitehouse from &quot;Affliction&quot; and Bob Dubois from &quot;Continental Drift&quot;: Tragic, uneasy and unsatisfied.<br />No doubt meticulously researched, Banks does a fabulous job of writing a book where it's difficult to tell where the history ends and the fiction begins. It's fascinating to enter the mindset of the Brown household, see John Brown ultimately become the man he would become famous and infamous for being, and have seen every step along the way.<br />At the very least, whether or not you're down with John Brown's history (I'm not), you have an enthralling read. At the very most, it's a reminder that, agree or disagree with John Brown's actions and philosophies, he was a human being.	2001-05-25

The same can be said of &quot;Horse Heaven,&quot; as it may take a time or two around the racetrack to get a grasp on Smiley's reins. <br />For starters, there are way too many characters, which accounts for the sheer mass of the book. The first twenty or so chapters are dedicated to introduction after introduction of new character after new character, some of whom never make an impression at all; others blend in with similar characters and become lost.<br />Then there are the characters who work: Al and Rosalind Maybrick, and an exploration of the marriage as Rosalind embarks on an affair with Dick Winterson, Al's horse trainer; the horse psychic Elizabeth Zada, whom I simply adored as she read the mind of Mr. T (the horse), and her boyfriend Plato; the horse Epic Steam (if horses can be villains, he fits the feedbag) and little Jesse, son of a highly superstitious bettor.<br />If Smiley had focused on only these, and a few of the others, the book would be a much easier read. But the fascinating tales of those above are lost amidst the shuffle, and makes it hard to slog through the less interesting characters, like Buddy Crawford. Still, those listed above are well worth a first, and most definitely a second glance. <br />It's just to bad you have to make your way through Smiley's cast of thousands in order to find the diamonds in the rough.	2001-05-18

It should come as no surprise that the newest book by Chris Crutcher, young adult literature titan, sets new ground as far as excellence is concerned.<br />In the recently released \\"Whale Talk,\\" Crutcher does exactly what he has done before, in such books as \\"The Crazy Horse Electric Game,\\" \\"Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes,\\" and \\"Ironman.\\"  <br />Thank God. A true master realizes you don't mess with perfection.<br />On the surface, the story is simple. It's only upon further examination that the complexities are revealed.<br />The Tao Jones (call him TJ) is a high schooler of mixed Japanese and African-American race, the adopted son of a white couple composed of a sophisticated lawyer and a former trucker, and a gifted swimmer. When a controversy arises over letterman's jackets, TJ finds himself putting together a swim team right out of \\"The Far Side.\\" <br />There's a kid whose mother's boyfriend wrapped his face in saran wrap as a baby to stop him from crying, and cut off the oxygen from his brain. There's also a guy who is just enormous and not built for the water, a virtual ghost who never says a word, an assistant coach who is living in a 24-hour gym to put his son through college, a studly guy who attracts the female crowd, an absolute brainiac, and a one-legged psychopath.<br />Intertwined with the humor that arises from such a situation is the story of Crutcher's characters' lives. TJ is at odds with a local maniac, who just happens to be the abusive white stepfather of a half-African-American little girl. When things get to be too much at home, TJ and his family take Heidi in, which doesn't please the nutcase.<br />Crutcher effortlessly bounces between swim team and home struggles, as the psycho grows more and more desperate to get his family back and the team must overcome their apparent loser status to become champions.<br />Sounds pretty cut and dry, doesn't it? You think you know what's going to happen, don't you? You're wrong.<br />Crutcher adeptly finds abalance between comedy and drama, and heroes and heartbreak in \\"Whale Talk,\\" which has surpassed \\"Sarah Byrnes\\" as my favorite Crutcher tale. You will laugh one moment, and cry the next. (Especially during the Happy Meal scene between Heidi and TJ's father. That one's going to get talked about for ages to come.)<br />I said before that Crutcher is doing with \\"Whale Talk\\" exactly what he has always done in his other works. Which is not entirely true. One gets the idea that Crutcher is testing the waters with many aspects of the new novel, seven years in the writing. There are parts in \\"Whale Talk\\" that are more gruesome, more hilarious and more touching, and which reach new heights.<br />Other, lesser critics will call \\"Whale Talk\\" formulaic. But Crutcher knows better than to fix what's not broken.<br />Instead, he only plays with it to come up with his best offering yet. Crutcher went outside his comfort zone and outside the comfort zones of his readers.<br />The result is the equivalent of a chef taking an old favorite recipe, throwing in some new spices and whipping up a zesty new dish on the brink of perfection.	2001-05-02

Have you gotten doused by the Harry Potter tsunami yet?<br />First, for the comatose: The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series is the brainchild of British  author J.K. Rowling that has taken the world by storm and is credited with  saving childrens' literature, with four titles available- &quot;Harry  Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber  of Secrets,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; and  the July-released &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;- and  three more on the way.<br />Rowling's now infamous protagonist is a young  wizard who survived an attack by evil Voldemort, a sorcerer so powerful  fellow magical folk dare not speak his name. Because Voldemort killed  Harry's parents but failed to murder Harry, the boy is a legend amongst  witches and wizards.<br />Unfortunately, Potter was raised by a disgusting  bunch of Muggle (nonmagic) relatives, and grew up without knowledge of his  abilities or status, until his identity was revealed to him in the first  book and he began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,  with friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br />With these books, Rowling  has created a world worthy of Roald Dahl (&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate  Factory&quot;) or John Bellairs (&quot;The House With a Clock In Its  Walls&quot;) and captured our own. With a record-shattering first printing  of more than 4 million for &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; it's safe to say-  this is Harry's world; we all just live in it.<br />The largest in the series  so far, &quot;Goblet&quot; clocks in at about 730 pages. But it's only that  long because so much happens. The fourth book takes Harry and company into  some uncharted territory. After a prologue foreshadowing the fallen  Voldemort's return into power, Harry and about 10,000 other magic folks  descend on the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. The  festivities are interrupted when Voldemort's symbol, the Dark Mark, appears  in the sky and Voldemort's minions, the Death Eaters, storm the campground.<br />When Harry returns to Hogwarts, he finds both a new Defense Against the  Dark Arts teacher, all-seeing black magic hunter Alastor &quot;Mad  Eye&quot; Moody and that Hogwarts will be the site of the annual Triwizard  Tournament, between the school and two others, the snooty Beauxbaton and  the chilly Durmstrang. And trouble, which comes when Harry is illegally  entered and declared the fourth contestant in the three-man race,  culminating in the death of a familiar face and a duel between Harry and  Voldemort.<br />Book Four maintains the wonder and magic that we've come to  expect from Rowling and Harry, although its epic size does mean some plots  could be shorter: Subplots involving a roving tabloid reporter with a  slander-ready quill and mysterious goings-on with some of the people behind  the World Cup scenes could be cut and not missed, and Voldemort goes on  quite a bit about his evil plans.<br />But these are small bumps in the  highway to Harry Potter heaven, with bright pots including Mad Eye; Harry's  crush on fellow Quidditch player Cho Chang; Hermione's creation of the  Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, or SPEW; a Ron and Hermione  bickerfest that may belie a romance, and touching correspondence between  Harry and his godfather, convicted murder Sirius Black.<br />Best of all, as  usual, are the antics of twins Fred and George Weasley, Ron's prankster  brothers who have embarked on a new venture inventing and selling gag  candies and other schemes. These two are always fun to watch, and Rowling  concludes &quot;Goblet&quot; by literally giving them the go-ahead spread  more mischief in the coming books.<br />Finally, a quick word ought to be said  about the price. 25 dollars is pretty pricey for a starving college  student- or anyone, really- who doesn't want to wait out the long library  lines or for paperback editions. It's too bad such a phenomenon can't be  more accessible to everybody.an't be  more accessible to everybody.	2000-08-08

What do you call a busload of lawyers plunging into a deep ocean from a high cliff?<br />A good start.<br />We've all heard the lawyer jokes. We've read the John Grisham novels, heard the horror stories about massive bills and  dirty cheats, and tuned into the high-profile court cases on TV. (Remember  OJ?)<br />We know how we feel about lawyers: They're high-priced ambulance  chasers who are only out for themselves and money. They're slime.  Right?<br />Author Lawrence Joseph takes a different approach with his 1997  nonfiction work &quot;Lawyerland.&quot; He shows what the slime think of  us.<br />&quot;They all watch their lawyer TV shows, read these sh---y legal  thrillers, like it's one big, suspenseful, meaningful endeavor,&quot;  railes C. Oliver Robinson, one of the legal eagles interviewed in the book.  &quot;They hate lawyers more than anyone else in the world- but law? Law!  They love the f-----g law! You see it in jurors' faces- even the most  sophisticated and street smart. They're not only intrigued- they're  impressed. Reasonable doubt- they go f------g bananas! Just say the words  and their eyes change.&quot;<br />With &quot;Lawyerland,&quot; Joseph takes  the path created by Studs Terkel with &quot;Working,&quot; the 1972 book in  which Terkel intereviewed people in a number of different careers- the  school teacher, the steel worker, the drugstore owner, etc.<br />In  &quot;Lawyerland,&quot; the result is a gritty, profanity-filled reality  work that cuts deep into the heart of many aspects of the legal system. As  the subtitle states, this is &quot;What Lawyers Really Talk About When They  Talk about Law.&quot;<br />Joseph interviews criminal justice lawyers, tax  attorneys, judges, corporate deal makers and personal injury lawyers. And  in a genius move, he simply sits back and lets them gab.<br />Boy, do they  talk. They talk about everything under the sun- law and the morality (or  lack thereof) within, rival firms, old associates, one-eyed monks, medical  malpractice, the fact that Alexander Hamilton and assassin Aaron Burr (got  milk?) were both lawyers, how to spot a lawyer in street clothes while  riding the subway, and Herman Melville's leagal tale &quot;Bartleby the  Scrivener.&quot;<br />The conversations are fast and furious, filled with  banter amongst colleagues or rivals, and thoughts on the profession.<br />What  makes &quot;Lawyerland&quot; so hard-hitting and mesmerizing, however, is  that these are real people, with real names, like Urquart and Voorhees.  This is real life, and Joseph doesn't shy away, even if the result is  rarely pretty.<br />What do you call a nonfiction piece that reveals law from  a lawyer's prespective, sin and all?<br />A very good start, indeed.	2000-06-08

We are witnesses again, this time  to Abe's final days and Chick's battle with his own mortality as he mourns  his friend.<br />The book falters after Ravelstein's passing and Chick and his  wife Rosamund travel to the Caribbean to escape Chick's ensuing depression.  When Chick contracts a possibly fatal illness, his struggle to stay alive  doesn't actually hurtthe book, but doesn't add anything either.<br />Things  are frenetic and feverish towards the end, but Bellow added more to the  book when leaving well enough alone might have been better.<br />Despite a  less-than-stellar finish, however, Bellow proves that the literary giant  standing he possesses is not a fluke; indeed, if one has never read the  author before, &quot;Ravelstein&quot; is a good place to start.	2000-06-06

Nora Roberts' latest novel, \\"Carolina Moon,\\" fits quite comfortably in the category of romance.<br />Unfortunately, that particular description seems to have a stigma that turns away people leery of the genre, especially men,  expect the stereotypical white-knight, breathless-heroine, ripped-bodice  plots.<br />The readers that turn away are missing out.<br />Most novels that are  called romances are so much more than that, and just as deserving of  readers' attentions as anything by John Grisham or Stephen King, or backed  by Oprah Winfrey.<br />\\"Carolina Moon\\" is no different. It is a tale that will  thrill any romantic spirit, but also quick-witted, engaging, erotic and  contains enough danger and mystery to make it a viable  action-adventure.<br />You won't be bored.<br />As a child in South Carolina,  eight-year-old Tory Bodeen escaped her abusive father's rage through the  adventures she shared with Hope Levelle, the eight-year-old daughter of a  wealthy family. When Hope was brutally murdered, shame and secrets  surrounded Tory's departure.<br />Years later, she's back in town where it all  began - Progress, South Carolina - and the same whispers are still  following her as she fights to make peace with what happened the night of  Hope's murder.<br />Along the way, Tory finds friendship with Hope's  rebellious twin sister Faith, and love with Hope's older brother Cade. Just  one problem - the monster who killed Hope is still free. And he's been  waiting for Tory to return.<br />Roberts has penned an edge-of-your-seat  thriller. Each time Tory (who has a bit of a psychic thing going on) feels  the presence of Hope's killer nearby, the reader's heart pounds with fear.  It's a chilling whodunit, enhanced by the fact that everyone in town is  suspect.<br />It also deserves mention that one of the most interesting  characters is Progress itself. The town has a mood, an aura of mystery to  it, and is filled with bizarre characters to give it an eclectic feel:  <br/>There's Cade and Faith's domineering mother, a woman who puts the  capital \\"B\\" in ... There's Cade's eccentric Aunt Rosie, whose absent-minded  thefts drive Tory up a wall, and there's Cecil, Tory's grandmother's  kindhearted plumber/lover.<br />Faith is a particularly joyous delight to  behold, and her sizzling affair with Wade, the town's sensitive  veterinarian, is a hoot.<br />Don't let the \\"romance novel\\" label scare you  away from this wonderful book. \\"Carolina Moon\\" ultimately boils down to  good old-fashioned storytelling at its best, and no one should go away  without experiencing it.	2000-05-01

There's a hokey premise lurking in Sam Siciliano's \\"Angel of the Opera: Sherlock Holmes Meets the Phantom of the Opera.\\"<br />On the heels of a disturbing case (the conclusion of which sets the tone and pace for the  rest of the book), Sherlock Holmes and his cousin Dr. Henry Vernier- the  book's narrator and an amiable replacement for Watson, with whom Holmes has  had a falling-out - are summoned to Paris, where managers of the Paris  Opera House have had problems with a mysterious Opera Ghost.<br />Sounds  corny, no?<br />The truth is, it's anything but. Siciliano ably takes Arthur  Conan Doyle's and Gaston Leroux's creations, and weaves them into a story  that is possibly better than those of his predecessors.<br />Vernier and  Holmes share a delightful familial connection that takes way from Watson's  absence as the two traipse through the underdwellings of the Opera House.  It's not hard to imagine the two lurking in the background of Leroux's  novel.<br />With considerable amusement, Siciliano transforms the flat,  supporting characters of <br />\\"Phantom\\" into viable human beings. <br />The  object of the Phantom's affections, Christine Daae, is a young woman torn  by conflicting desires. Her lover Raoul de Chagny is a repulsive moonstruck  suitor. Perhaps not Leroux's original concept of the characters, but  infinitely more appealing to the reader.<br />Holmes and the Phantom's  personalities are not altered, but the author presents them in a more  accessible manner than Doyle and Leroux's versions- most likely because of  the era they were written in- allow.<br />They are the Holmes and Phantom we  are all familiar with; at the same time, they are no longer a stuggle to  read.<br />The clash of titans is not so much a battle between enemies as it  is a meeting of equals. Both are masters of their environments, incredibly  gifted and neither is completely at ease with humanity.<br />From the moment  Sherlock receives a warning telegram from the Phantom, neither man has the  upper hand. When they finally come face to face, Siciliano wisely focuses  on the mutual respect that only two of the most popular literary creations  ever could have for each other.<br />Apart, the characters of Sherlock Holmes  and the Phantom of the Opera are adorable. But when thrust together, as  they are in \\"Angel of the Opera,\\" the results are mesmerizing.	2000-04-02
US	50920512	R2K6Z9FH243OX3	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A classic (and I love it), but why?	I hated J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" when I had to read it in high school. I thought main character Holden Caulfield could have been killed off in the first chapter, and it would have made for a better  story.<br />The book takes place over a weekend in the life of Holden, a  perennial dropout in virtually anything he does. He gets kicked out of the  latest in a string of colleges in the beginning, so he heads home, for New  York City.<br />Once in the Big Apple, Holden looks up old girlfriends, visits  a prostitute (and winds up haggling over the price), is reunited with his  beloved sister Phoebe and does a host of other stuff one typically does  over a weekend or when one has been thrown out of college and doesn't want  one's parents to know.<br />The entire story is told from Holden's point of  view, and in a stream of consciousness that bounces from one subject to  another at random. The character ruminates on where the ducks in Central  Park go in the winter, his roommate's clipping of toenails and sex.<br />He  also has developed the incredibly annoying habit of saying something, then  reiterating it as if his audience does not believe him. He really does, I  swear to God. After a while, classic or not, defining character trait or  not, you want to smack him. You really do. But that was really the only  left-over hostility I felt for what many consider to be the Great American  Novel.<br />Maybe it's because Holden is now a fellow college student, and I  can commiserate with him when people drop into his room unannounced or are  obnoxious.<br />Maybe it's because I have grown into a very random thought  pattern myself, so I no longer find the subject jumps to be quite so  annoying.<br />It could be because young Master Caulfield is a cynic, and I am  an individual who celebrates cynicism and sarcasm, as these are  characteristics which seem to be even more the rage today than they were in  the '50s.<br />Or could it be because there's still such afervor over  \\"Catcher,\\" even though it was originally published in 1951. And while we're  at it, exactly WHY is there such a fervor over the book?<br />Is it because  Salinger, after completion and publication, slipped away from the American  public and became a recluse, writing (or so we think) in the comfort of his  own home behind a great wall of silence?<br />Would we still like the story if  J.D. Salinger were the century's Stephen King, pumping out novel after  novel after novel, and \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was just the book between  \\"Franny and Zooey\\" and \\"Hapworth 16, 1924\\"?<br />Would we still applaud if  Holden Caulfield were the adolescent cynic created by a one-time author  named Milton Nosepicker?<br />Or does the story transcend its author, his  seclusion or the fervor around it? The answer is up to you. I'm stumped.	2000-04-01

The question I get asked most often has got to be, \\"So what's your favorite book?\\"<br />It's a tough one to answer, because there are so many wonderful books out there. But when all's said and done, I think I have to go with \\"Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes,\\" by Chris Crutcher.<br />Overweight  Eric \\"Mobe\\" (as in \\"Moby\\") Calhoune and burn victim Sarah Byrnes united  during junior high because of their shared \\"terminal uglies,\\" fighting off  bullies and insidious school faculty, to name a few.<br />Now in high school,  Mobe's an athlete on the swim team, despite his efforts to remain plump and  preserve his treasured friendship with Sarah Byrnes (sick of every idiot  calling attention to her condition and her last name, she makes everybody  call her by her full name).<br />When she winds up in the psych ward, the  story launches into something both horrifying and heart wrenching: When  Sarah Byrnes was three, her abusive father Vergil held her face to a hot  stove.<br />Mobe's got to find a way to protect her from her father and bring  her back into reality.<br />It's a truly gripping tale, one that will have  readers on the edge of their seats. Vergil Byrnes is by no means an  ordinary villain; he is a monster. But Crutcher doesn't simply stop with  Sarah Byrnes' saga.<br />On the sidelines, but no less important, is the story  of Mobe's rivalry with Mark Brittain, a fellow swimmer. <br />Mark is hardcore  religious, while Mobe's more accepting and easygoing. It's fascinating to  watch such different individuals with so different beliefs go head to head,  whether in the pool or in their debate class, Contemporary American  Thought.<br />It's heavy stuff, but Crutcher adeptly balances it by giving his  characters the ever welcome gift of sarcasm. The humor is a welcome  counterbalance to such controversial taboos as abortion, religion and  censorship. Virtually every line is one that will make you howl with  laughter, even as you are moved to tears by the characters' plights. This,  my friends, is real life.<br />And what characters there are! Besides the  aforementioned few, Eric's mother is a delight, the very picture of hip  maternal instincts, and her geeky boyfriend Carver ultimately proves heroes  can come in surprising packages. Ellen Lemry, Mobe's swim coach/CAT  teacher/adviser is a force to be reckoned with.<br />But my hero is Steve  Ellerby, an enigma in and of himself. Son of a preacher and a choir boy, he  also possesses an obnoxious blue car and what some would consider a  sacrilegious personality. He's acerbic, he's disrespectful, he's fun.<br />And  he has the best scene in the book, but race through it and you'll miss it  when Brittain kneels at the pool side to lead his teammates in prayer:  \\"Ellerby drops to both knees, throwing his head back as he stretches his  arms wide, and loudly begs Jesus to come swim the laps for him. When  there's no answer, he opens one eye to a squint and asks if John the  Baptist is home. `Damn,' he says in the face of no response.\\"<br />In fact,  \\"Staying Fat\\" is frustrating because no amount of description will be  adequate in capturing its splendor in its entirety. This review is only the  tip of the iceberg. There's still so much to discover: Read it and find out  for yourself.	2000-03-24

I tried one of his books, but it was just weird.\\"<br />The answer: King writes from his heart. When at his best, he is possibly the consummate storyteller of our time, with enough attention to character, detail and action to draw the  reader in. And it doesn't hurt when he scares the snot out of us.<br />Yes,  his stories can be weird if one approaches his novels the wrong way. I  started off with \\"It,\\" and at first swore never to read a King book again.  <br />So I tell people to start their King experience with \\"The Green Mile,\\"  arguably King's best work.<br />All of the author's storytelling capabilities  come alive- indeed they leap off the page and into your heart- and display  whatever weird astral plane King is writing from. Surely, it is not of this  earth.<br />\\"The Green Mile\\" sets the mood for King's other works, allowing  the reader to understand, in a way, where he is coming from. \\"It,\\"  \\"Misery,\\" \\"The Stand\\" - they'll all be a piece of cake after this.<br />The  book was originally released in a serial format - six editions - in 1996,  later compressed into a single edition, and the film version is to be  released later this year. Paul Edgecombe is a veteran guard on the Green  Mile, a 1930s Death Row, when John Coffey is brought on board.<br />A big,  black bear of a man, Coffey's been convicted of raping and murdering two  little white girls, so Edgecombe is caught off guard when the new inmate's  first question is <br />\\"Do you leave a light on after bedtime?\\"<br />In time,  Edgecombe comes to realize that Coffey possesses a miraculous gift, and he  begins to question Coffey's guilt.<br />Along the way, we are introduced to  Edgecombe's fellow workers and the other inmates waiting for their time in  the electric chair. <br />Among them are two of the most disturbing characters  in literature: Percy Wetmore, a snivelling, whiny weasel who stands as a  testament to the argument that power corrupts; and William \\"Billy the Kid\\"  Wharton, a nineteen-year-old behind cell bars who just doesn't care, as the  head warden has noted. Hell, they can only fry him once, right?<br />Special  attention must be paid to Mr. Jingles, the mouse with almost human  intelligence who hangs out on the Mile. Mr. Jingles is the epitome, the  very soul, of the plane King is operating on. There is character here, and  heart, with more than a whisker of the supernatural. The mouse is  mesmerizing.<br />Indeed, \\"The Green Mile\\" is one of those books that  frustrates reviewers in that, in addition to being damn near perfect, no  amount of description will be adequate in describing the perfection of the  book and what works within.<br />Suffice it to say that anyone who reads this  novel will be taken with the tale, and if you ever read a Stephen King  book, read this one. Heck, if you ever only read just one book, let this be  the one.<br />Finally, read the book and then watch the trailer for the movie  then, knowing the story as you do,  try to suppress a shiver when Tom Hanks says \\"This is the story of a  miracle that happened here where I work . . . on the Green Mile.\\"<br />I get  goosebumps just typing about it.	2000-03-24

Instead, he spends his time exploring  David's state of mind- how would you feel if you suddenly transformed into  a giant mammary gland?- which makes for an interesting psychological  drama.<br />First, David describes the experience of being a breast as though  he does not quite believe it himself: Is it all a dream? How is he able to  communicate with the others around him? Where'd his face go?<br />Later,  David's mentality changes, first to a perverted interest in a female nurse  who washes him, then utter paranoia that he is under constant surveillance  while in his hospital room, and finally a blatant refusal to accept his  condition and the belief that he has gone mad.<br />Things degenerate to the  point where Kepesh believes he cannot hear his doctors' actual diagnoses;  because of his \\"insanity\\" he only hears what he wants to hear.<br />Throughout  all this, we see how David's wife, Claire, deals with her husband's new  state, as well as the reactions from his father, his doctors and nurses,  and his mentor, who collapses in giggles at the sight of David the  Breast.<br />\\"The Breast\\" is one big fat Franz Kafka admiration camp, where  all the questions about <br />\\"The Metamorphosis\\" apply. Is David really a  breast? Or is he mentally insane? Is he really being watched?<br />But the  Kafka homage doesn't end there. Kepesh mentions strained relations with his  father. Gregor's daddy wasn't a picnic either. Kepesh also calls the two  hairs growing from his nipple his \\"antennae.\\"<br />At one point, David even  comments that most of the characters' names begin with the letter \\"K\\".  <br />To which his doctor, Dr. Klinger, replies, \\"The alphabet only has  twenty-six letters. And there are four billion of us in need of initials  for purposes of identification.\\"<br />It's a smart book, one's that's  certainly different from the usual literary offerings. It's certainly a  concept film director Spike Jonze should contemplate following \\"Being John  Malkovich\\" up with.<br />It's a wild, short ride of a tale and one worth  taking just for the sheer spectacle of it all.	2000-03-16

Shortly after finishing it, I sought out Beryl Bainbridge's YOUNG ADOLF and several of Martin Amis' works.  Not only that, but READING LIST spurred me  into re-trying Thomas Pynchon's massive MASON &amp; DIXON; this time  around, I actually enjoyed it. Through this book, I have discovered the  joys of John Irving, Salman Rushdie, and many others. Book groups would do  well to consider READING LIST when choosing their next selection. Who  knows? Maybe it would be great selected material itself. There's certainly  enough room for discussion.	1999-07-10
