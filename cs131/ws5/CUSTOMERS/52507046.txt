It is intended primarily for those who might be considering going into the food service industry, but is also fun and informative reading for home cooks.  It covers how to get into a kitchen, what education you may need or might find useful, the basics of running the business, and even how to open your own restaurant.  It also shows other resources that can be turned to for additional support and research.  Each chapter also ends with a sampling of the chapter's featured cook's recipes that you probably will not want to try at home.	2004-05-11

Bernie Mac has a lot to say and a lot of things to teach.  From his fatherless childhood to moonlighting as a comedian while frying fish during the day, Bernie lays it all out for the world to see and learn from.  Forget about sports stars as role-models....all you need is Bernie Mac.  A man who knows how to get things done, no matter how unpleasant they may be.

The most appealing thing about her is the simple fact that one can disagree with her opinions without feeling argumentative.  She has a way of presenting her opinions that does an excellent job of articulating why she feels the way she does without sounding like she is attacking any opposing opinion.

Character development is great....I actually found myself caring about what happened and pulling for the two main characters.  And when I got to the end of the book, I really didn't want it to end.

She covers many of the cultural differences that served as stumbling blocks for herself and anyone else who might find themselves in the same situation.  She manages to lift the veil on the reason why Parisians are generally considered rude......the simple fact that they don't know you and that it takes time (alot of time) to build a friendship there.  It also serves as an informative eye-opener for anyone who may be considering a visit to France with its abundance of useful information for getting by.

From the Knights' endeavors to protect pilgrims in Palestine, to their more lucrative  business endeavors in Europe, to their final hurrah tied to a burning stake, Frank Sanello takes you there.  He shows how the Knights played a pivotal role in the Crusades, how they invented banking, and how royal greed can overcome most any obstacle.  He also covers many of the myths surrounding not only their intiation rites and their beliefs, but also the myths surrounding their legendary wealth.  Did they ever really have that much wealth?  Where is it now?  What about the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant?  While obviously nobody actually knows for sure about these things, Sanello does cover many of the theories regarding them.	2004-04-19

Her opinions are well laid-out and she refrains from any of the typical mud-slinging that one would come to expect from a book with a political bent, which actually makes it easier to think about the things she is saying rather than trying to defend or justify one's own opinions.  Wonderfully written and thought provoking, I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in recent political history but wants to avoid all of the childish bickering.	2004-04-16

With all of these comparisons floating around, I was expecting a good funny read.  What I got was a guy who can't stand the thought that the reader might forget that he is a gay Canadian Jew.  After managing to make it halfway through the book I was very tempted to give up, but I decided to keep on, and finally I was rewarded with a couple of really good essays towards the end of the book.  But nothing worth writing home about or plunking down your hard-earned dough for.  I really like what one reviewer said....that Rakoff is either incredibly intelligent or just in love with his thesaurus.  I personally think he is both.  His intelligence is clearly there, but he likes to hide it in a maze of needlessly complicated prose and obscure references that only a gay Canadian Jew would understand.  See? I've only mentioned it twice and it's already annoying!  If you're looking for a challenging read that offers little in the way of a reward, then this book is for you.  If you're looking for even a little bit of humor, then it's not.  Personally, I was glad when it was over.	2004-04-13

Unfortunately, this book isn't all that great.  First of all, many of the people who supply answers tend to present theories as facts.  Secondly, the answers aren't always quite as concise and to-the-point as one would like.  For example, should it really take two pages to say that we just don't know if dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded?  Questions for which we have no answer probably would have been better off edited out of this book.  Then there are the occasional answers that wander around all over the place without really answering the question.  Overall, a pretty disappointing reading experience.	2004-04-12

I think this book contains much that any reader out there could relate to.  Unfortunately, Dan simply isn't funny.  I think even Dan realized this, and tried throwing in a few profanities in a futile effort to garner a chuckle or two.  But even that didn't work, as it only made it more obvious his lack of humor.

For example, I now understand the difference between a 2 and a 4 stroke engine.  I still can't explain the physics behind any of this stuff, but then again, I don't really want to.  If you have an interest in understanding cars, or an interest in physics, this book will keep you interested with Barry's down-to-earth writing style.

Taking the opposite approach from the other books that tell you what to do to maintain a healthy loving relationship, Ben goes through all of the most common things that people do to ruin a relationship, or even to keep out of a relationship at all.  Everybody should be able to relate to this book in some way.  I know I've been guilty of some of these behaviors, and I've certainly been a victim of some of them, too.  If you want to learn a little more about how good relationships work without getting bogged down by some tedious psycho-babble nonsense, Ben's book is a very entertaining way to go about it.

The Fat Fallacy is a refreshing new way (or rather old way) of looking at food.  In our search for the quick-fix weight-loss solution, we have basically abandoned food and learned to embrace a diet of generally non-edible chemicals that have been dressed to resemble food.  This becomes apparent at the end of every chapter, where there is a &quot;faux-foods&quot; quiz, which lists the ingredients of a common food substance and dares you to identify it.  I only got one right, and wondered why I've been eating all this stuff.  His advice is grounded in common sense - &quot;if it ain't food, don't eat it&quot; - and is actually quite easy to follow.  How much time do Americans spend obsessing about how many carbs or sugars or fat grams are in their &quot;food&quot;?  And when was the last time an American actually ENJOYED one of these low-fat, low-carb, low-sugar, low-taste, low-nutrition meals?  The basic idea behind this &quot;diet&quot; is that Americans are fat because they eat too much.  We keep getting fatter in spite of all the diet &quot;foods&quot; we eat.  The human body doesn't get the nutrition it needs from this chemical soup, so it remains hungry until it gets some kind of real food.  This is the typical binge.  It's really quiet disgusting if you think about how much we eat.  But in The Fat Fallacy, we are shown how to choose real food and enjoy it, all the while losing weight.  How?  When your body actually gets the nutrients it needs, it stops telling you that it's hungry, and that's when you stop eating.  Pretty simple stuff.  No agonizing over what frozen-food item has less fat or less carbs, no more choking down those tasteless food-sticks, no more disgusting eating habits.  Our bodies need food.  Be nice to your body and give it some.	2004-03-26

That's what they're famous for.  In Joie de Vivre, Robert Arthur takes you through the different segments of the typical French day, starting with a simple and relaxing breakfast, and going all the way through the cup of herbal tea before retiring to bed.  He explains in very simple language how to get the most out of even the simplest, most mundane things in life that Americans typically either take for granted or rush through in an effort to get to the next task.  The French have learned to reap enjoyment from things that many other people have learned to treat as annoyances.  By following at least some of the suggestions in this book, one can significantly reduce stress levels and will be able to enjoy life more thoroughly.  Even doing something as simple as waking up half an hour earlier and having a quick and easy breakfast of coffee and toasted baguette with butter and preserves can make a huge difference and will likely lead the reader to try some of the other suggestions.  The only thing I didn't like about the book is that at some points it seems to be written by a child.  I don't know if this was done intentionally to emphasize the simplicity of it all, but it sometimes felt like I was reading a 7 year old's essay.  If you can put up with a childish writing style, the ideas behind the words can make a world of difference in your life.	2004-03-02

I love reading this sort of stuff.  But I was sadly disappointed when I started reading.  Two pages per topic.  Just two!  And for most topics, over half of that space is devoted to pictures!  The writing is rather disjointed and didn't flow very well.  There was not enough information on any one topic to be of any real use.  Some things in the book are just plain wrong.  It makes me wonder if the author bothered to make use of his mini-bibliographies for each topic.  How can the author presume to tell me about Christianity without once referencing the Bible?  Or tell me about Islam without referencing the Quran?  These should have been the first sources he turned to.  Objectivity?  Forget about it.  There is none.  The author clearly has his opinions and an agenda to promote, which does not belong in this kind of book.  In all, I would have to say that the only redeeming quality of this book are the pictures (which is the last thing I was looking for).  Other than that, I would have to classify this one as a miserable failure.	2004-02-16

Most English-speaking people can't speak English.  Perhaps they slept through every single English class they took.  Perhaps they just don't care.  It's written in a very humorous, readable style that will keep you interested rather than putting you to sleep.  And with all the examples of atrocious grammatical errors, it will show people just how ridiculous they sound when they can't be bothered to get it right.  Every chapter has something in it that will at least get a giggle out of you.  I found it especially amusing after reading his numerous bashings of editors and proofreaders, to find that his own proofreader apparently wasn't paying too much attention on page 131.  This book should be required reading for anyone who speaks English and for those that only think they do.  Read it, learn it, and apply it.

With his extensive experience in service, he is most definitely qualified to do so, and yet he only offers glimpses of his total knowledge.  While many of the things in this book will never actually be used by the average person due to their expense and impracticality, there is still much that can and should be put to use in every-day living.  While some may view these rules or standards as superfluous or even snobbish, the fact is that these have all been developed over many years and each has its own very legitimate reason for being.  The complaints I have with this book are ones that could have been easily remedied.  When discussing and describing the various types of tableware, more pictures would have been useful.  Only select pieces have been illustrated, leaving the others subject to the whims of the imagination.  And while he mentions several different napkin folds, and even specifies his own personal favorite fold, he never explains how to make these folds or shows how they are supposed to look.  The sections on how to be the perfect host/hostess and guest, and on how to eat certain different foods could prove to be useful in reducing the potential for embarrassment in the future, and the section explaining the hierarchy of menservants was quite interesting, even if only as a history lesson that serves to demonstrate the logistical nightmares that formal dining can create.	2004-02-05

A vague sort of marker on the timeline of earth's predetermined destiny.  He does a fairly decent job of using previously fulfilled prophecies to prove the veracity of the Bible, and then goes on to give his educated opinion of how the end times might play out.  While Hagee offers much to learn and ponder, no self-respecting person, especially a Christian, should take his word to be infallible.  Read the book, do your own study and research, and come to your own conclusions.  As Hagee himself states in the book, most of it doesn't really even matter for Christians because we won't be here when it happens anyway.	2004-01-29

Anthony Bruno does a wonderful job of keeping the reader hooked, as he tells the stories of killer Richard Kuklinski and ATF agent Dominick Polifrone.  Because he's telling both of their stories, it may seem like he bounces around a bit, but I think he did a wonderful job of keeping the points of view separate, and therefore reducing any potential confusion.

It sheds light on the fact that America is very unprepared for a massive biological attack, yet at the same time is not likely to experience one.  While small-scale attacks are possible and maybe even likely to occur, the fact is that they are not likely to succeed to any great extent due to the difficulty of creating a bug that is sufficiently virulent and able to survive on its own outside of the lab.  Certainly more can and should be done to prevent and/or contain any such attacks, but at the same time, people should not be losing much sleep over it.  <BR>Probably the most interesting thing about this book is the level of paranoia and moral superiority displayed by the American government.  They spent so much time and money scrutinizing the Soviet Union, sure that they were violating the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972, even after the collapse of the Union.  And of course, the soviets were doing just that and even admitted to it.  But the level of moral superiority is just disgusting, as the U.S. was just as guilty as they were, probably even more guilty than the book leads one to believe.	2004-01-21

He may be a premier fakebuster, but as a writer, he could use a little more practice.  While the subject matter was interesting, Hoving had a slightly difficult time keeping my attention.  He seemed to jump around alot, and made a lot of assumptions regarding my knowledge of the art world.  False Impressions is filled with all kinds of interesting tidbits about the world of art forgery and fakebusting.  Unfortunately, it can be somewhat difficult to separate fact from opinion.  As a novice to art appreciation, I found much of the material to be &quot;above my head&quot;.  Perhaps after a few years of study, I will be in a better position to fully benefit from all Hoving offers.  Probably the simplest and most effective thing he could have done to improve the book would be to include more pictures, perhaps even some color photos, and have them more logically located in the chapters in which the pieces are discussed, as opposed to having a group of plates three-quarters of the way through the book.  At the very least, the text could have referenced the plate section.  Unfortunately, every time a new piece is mentioned, the curious reader has to flip to the plate section and hope that the piece is represented there.  Overall, I would say that if you are really interested in fine art, you will find this book enlightening.  But it's not something one would read just for fun.	2004-01-15

It has to be the funniest book I've read in years!  In it, the life of Christ is retold by his life-long pal Biff.  In the Bible, much of Christ's life is unaccounted for.  For what reason?  So Christopher Moore could write this book!  God definitely has a sense of humor, and would almost certainly be pleased with this book.  And while it is entirely fiction, there are parts that, due to ambiguity in the Bible, just might be true.

I admire the path that Eustace Conway has chosen and his decision to do it, but at the same time, came to lose much respect for him.  The book would have been much better had it left out the continual droning about his bad relationship with his father, and how it affects his life now.  There are few guys out there that feel they haven't failed to live up to the expectations of their father.....so what?  Quit whining about it and get over it.  On a positive note, this book does show that modern America is lacking something.....a certain rite of passage into manhood, and most boys are too busy playing video games and watching tv to notice that they are getting jilted of the experience.  Consequently, they grow up not knowing who they are or what they might be able to accomplish....they've never had to push themselves, and are, therefore, poorly equipped do deal with a situation in which they might have to do something slightly more complicated than throwing a frozen burrito in the microwave.	2003-08-17

There's not a whole lot of character development here, and what serves as a plot is rather choppy and incoherent throughout most of the book.  It was almost like Tony couldn't decide if he wanted to write a novel or a bunch of short stories.  Sadly, references to the food service industry were sorely lacking in this one.  I think he should keep that, as it really sets him apart and makes his work that much more unique.  Regardless, it was still fun to read, and I look forward to more of his work.	2003-08-17

Who couldn't laugh at Giacomo Castelvetro's accusation that the English put enough vinegar in their salads to give Morgante a footbath?<br />Several reviewers have complained about the lack of diversity and the Euro-centric selection of writings.  I disagree.  I feel that this book represents an accurate cross-section of world-wide food writing.  Sure, it contains a lot of writing about French food, but then who has written more about food than the French?  One of the prerequisites of writing about food is to have some, lest you will not know what you are writing about.  And the massive abundance and variety of food that the French have access to and have mastered the preparation of, lends to them a certain exclusivity regarding the matter.  This book was by no means meant to contain every tidbit ever written about food in the history of the world.  One will be much more pleased with it if it is viewed as an introduction to many notable and worthwhile food writers, from which one may seek out the other scribblings of these authors.	2003-08-07

Loaded with photos mostly from the Indiana Historical Society, it really brings home the feel of life in Indianapolis way back when.  Unfortunately, as one other reviewer noticed, the book is chock full of grammatical and typographical errors, which make it somewhat painful to read.  Hoosiers are already known for having an exceptionally poor education system, and this book will not lead anyone to believe differently.  Definitely worth reading, but not worth the price, as it leaves much of the city's history unexplored and unaccounted for.	2003-08-07

A world where freedom of thought is disdained in the interest of stability and happiness.  A world where God has been dethroned and locked in a closet because mankind no longer has any use for Him.  In Huxley's Brave New World, all choices have been eliminated and replaced with a pre-programmed sense of self and duty.  Although written long ago, this work still presents the reader with many relevant things to think about today.  And it is somewhat disturbing to notice that many of things that compose this brave new world are, in fact, either in place today, or someone is working on them.	2003-08-03

Ann Coulter has given us a book that describes, in detail, how the left continues to do nothing but lie about the American right, and not only how they continue to get away with it, but how they also, on occasion, actually convince a person or two that they are telling the truth.  Ann makes the point that liberals can only argue on a 6th grade level, which inevitably leads them to their ultimate in logic and persuasion....\\"you're stupid\\".  The only thing Ann got wrong in this book, is her statement that liberals don't read books.  One quick glance at all the negative reviews of this particular book resoundingly refutes that statement, and I thank all the liberals out there who actually took the time to read it.  The fact that you bothered to read the views of the \\"enemy\\" indicates a certain level of maturity on your part that has yet to be attained by most of your peers.	2003-08-02

The recounting of numerous cases was interesting, but where are the mechanics of the investigation?  How were the profiles developed?  John Douglas promises a look inside the &quot;elite serial crime unit&quot;, but makes you look with one eye closed.  He seems to be interested mainly in promoting himself, rather than the profiling science he claims to have developed.  And how about failures?  Are we to believe that John Douglas always gets his man?  Show us some cases where the profile was drastically wrong.  Show us what you learned from that.  The first step in learning from a mistake is admitting that you made one in the first place.  Don't just give us the profiles of past criminals, show us how you came up with it.  This is an incredibly fascinating field, and John doesn't seem to be too interested in teaching even the basics of it to the average reader.  And especially after he complains in the end of the book about not being able to stop the criminals until it's too late, you would think he would have an interest in educating the public about recognizing certain signs that could indicate a tendency toward future violent behavior.  Unfortunately, after reading this book, I have no more useful knowledge than I did before I read it.	2003-07-30

Critser has given us yet another book bemoaning the obesity of America.  While very readable and somewhat entertaining, the book presents absolutely nothing new to the reader.  Fat people experience more health problems than thin people, they die younger, they cost more to take care of, etc.  All of these are painfully obvious in today's society, and have already been pointed out numerous times.  This book lacks the same thing that all the other books lack.....a solution to the problem.  Sure he tosses out a few examples of what has worked in certain small areas of the nation, but it obviously isn't enough.  The problem is that the authors of these books are like most other American citizens.....&quot;forget about the cause, let's treat the symptoms&quot;.  The problem isn't that Americans eat poorly and don't exercise.  The problem is that Americans simply don't care.  Throwing out new innovative diets and exercise programs won't solve anything.  It only treats symptoms, and does a poor job of that.  If America's obesity problem is to really be solved, the cause (America's apathy) must be confronted and defeated.  That likely won't happen until the problem is much worse than it already is......until the pain of seeing people dropping like flies outweighs the pain of doing anything about it.	2003-07-23

In \\"Hitler Slept Late\\", Duffy takes a look at several scenarios during WWII that, had they been handled differently, may have actually won the war for Hitler.  Among these are included the revelation that Hitler did indeed sleep late, not usually inclined to awaken before noon, which was one of the biggest reasons why the American and British invasions on D-Day were so enormously successful.  Also discussed was his political ineptitude, declaring war on the U.S. after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, expecting the Japanese to help him with his fight against the Red Army.  Had he not done so, the U.S., with her isolationist and non-interventionist policies, would have had to limit herself to fighting only in the Pacific theatre, buying Hitler at least a few more years in which to complete his conquest of the entirety of the European continent, and thereby rendering an invasion by U.S. forces virtually impossible.  The book also covers his inability to recognize distinct and overwhelming advantages.  For example, when he invaded the Siviet Union, the vast majority of the citizens welcomed the Nazis as their liberators from the Soviet regime, and practically begged to fight FOR Hitler.  Instead of enlisting the aid of a sea of volunteers, most of whom would know better than he how to fight the Red Army, he had them sent to concentration camps.  <br />The only disppointment in this book was when Duffy decided to quote Goeffrey Regan regarding Eisenhower's \\"failure\\" to capture Berlin.  Eisenhower, in fact had very excellent reasons for not pursuing what some viewed as the ultimate prize.  First of all, the Soviets were already on their way, and would reach it first.  Second, it held absolutely no value.  Third, the fighting would likely be some of the bloodiest in the entire war (Ike was later proven correct based upon the casualties suffered by the Soviets).  Fourth, there was already a pre-existing arrangement between the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to dividethe city after the war.  Fifth, the Soviets were much more ruthless in their dealings with prisoners of war....which is why most German soldiers were fleeing to the west in order to surrender to the U.S. and Britain....after seeing first-hand the barbaric conditions of German POW camps, Ike understandably lost all interest in granting the Nazis any measure of mercy...let the Reds do what they will to them.  And finally, with the war winding down in Europe, Allied soldiers would have been put to much better use fighting Japan than capturing a useless city.  So why not let the Soviets capture Berlin and then claim what was ours by previous agreement?  This was not a failure on Eisenhower's part, but rather pure brilliance.	2003-07-22

I didn't expect an awful lot, but was very surprised when I found that Will actually knows the game....better than most people, even.  Delving into baseball's past and yet staying connected to the present and looking into the future, Will gives the reader a very clear picture of how the game is played at the professional level, detailing many of the subtleties and minutiae that must be mastered to attain that level.  At times a little dry and over-statistical, the book is filled with many informative and amusing quotes and anecdotes which make the book an overall pleasure to read.  Highly recommended for any semi-serious student of the game.	2003-07-09

Instead of focusing on one event or one geographical area, Bernier chooses to explore the entire world in and around the year 1800.  Why 1800?  Because, as Bernier explains it, that was when the world as WE know it was born.  The birth of democracy and a giant step towards globalism were the most obvious things.  As far as the structure of the book is concerned, the first part deals with events in Europe, especially the conquest of Europe by France.  The second part deals primarily with the newly born United States, and the problems they dealt with, especially when it came to relations with both England and France who were at the time locked in an unwinnable war.  Bernier also goes on to cover South America and Asia, though in much less detail.  The only complaint I have is that Bernier includes a section on Africa.....which is only 20 pages long.  Token?  Perhaps.  But given that so much of the world's economy was intertwined with the slave trade originating out of Africa, surely there would have been more to write about the &quot;mysterious&quot; continent.  Overall, the book is highly readable, giving more than just bland dates, names, and locations.  Bernier gives us a look at how individuals lived, and even gives the reader an idea of how they might have lived had they been born in the late 18th century.  Food, fashion, society, architecture, it's all there.	2003-06-30

He does a wonderful job of letting the reader get to know the soldiers on a personal level.....to the point that if the reader were to actually meet one of these soldiers, he would instantly feel like he has known him for years.

It was interesting to see not only how devastating the Black Death was, but also how resilient human populations are....even when faced with multiple population-depleting disasters.  It was also quite interesting to see exactly how the Black Death changed society, and how it actually made life better for most of those who survived it.  Probably my favorite chapter was the one that dealt with how it changed the entire medical profession.  Whereas pre-plague, the citizenry relied on 1,000 year old texts, the failure of medicine to prevent or stop the plague brought about radical changes in how medicine was studied and practiced.	2003-05-28

By modern standards, this book may not measure up to what many would call a &quot;classic&quot;, but taken in it's historical context, one can understand it's importance.  This book was written and published at a time when doing so would have been extremely dangerous.  In fact, Solzhenitsyn was actually exiled for it, and was lucky to receive only that punishment for it.  He offers what was at the time, a rare and frightening look behind the iron curtain.  This book is still important today, as it reminds us of what tyranny can and frequently does accomplish, and why we still fight against it.<br />On a lighter note, I found it rather interesting that this book brought back many fond memories of being in the Army.  The two experiences seem to be somewhat similar, although it is difficult to make an accurate comparison without having gone through the Soviet prison camp system.  It seems the biggest difference, though, is that people actually CHOOSE to be in the Army and they are well-fed and clothed while there.  It was also interesting to note that most of the prisoners took a certain pride in their work, even though they were not paid for it, and they were forced to do it.  This is something of a rarity in today's free society where laziness and incompetence are usually greatly encouraged and rewarded.	2003-05-07

It definitely did not deliver.While the action &quot;scenes&quot; were quite fun, they were also rather repetitive.  There was very little plot, and no character development.  The end result is a story that is about as believable as a Rambo movie.  I very seriously doubt that the entire Chinese navy, which was being constantly augmented with Soviet boats and crews, could be eliminated by a single sub.  I don't buy it, and neither should you.	2003-05-05

The whole idea behind me reading this book was to get more general information regarding psychology so that I could make a better informed decision regarding whether or not a career in that field would be for me.  Unfortunately, most of the book was WAY over my head.  Orbach could be totally full of it and I wouldn't even know better.  While the majority of the book was indecipherable to me, the parts that dealt with the actual interactions between therapist and patient did make for somewhat interesting, if uneducational, reading.  Someone with a degree in psychology might get something out of this book, but I didn't.  The worst part of it all, as has been explained in other reviews here, is that at the end of the book, Orbach explains that everything in it is fictional.  This, in my opinion, made the book truly worthless, realizing that with an entirely fictional account, she could make the patient do whatever she wanted, which would make everything too easy for her.  Everything ends up too neat and tidy, and I suspect that in real life, such things are very rarely that simple.	2003-04-29

While most of the information is pretty basic, and he doesn't go too far into the details, for anyone who is seeking the truth about Jesus, it is a great jumping-off point.  The only problem I had with the book, is that he stresses the point that he is writing it as a legal journalist....supposedly looking at and weighing all the evidence and making an appropriate conclusion.  But the only people he spoke to were the ones trying to make the case for Christ.  To be truly objective, he should have given equal audience to Christ's detractors, rather than just taking excerpts from their books and presenting them to the pro-Christ scholars.  He explains about rebuttals and their importance in a truth-seeking court-room, but doesn't offer any rebuttal to those that don't agree with his &quot;panel&quot; of scholars.	2003-04-15

The fact that Swindle was able to visit and interview Escobedo several times during his incarceration was, I am sure, immensely helpful.  I feel that books like these can actually help prevent crime...in this case rape...by arming potential victims with crucial knowledge.  The first thing they have to realize--and this is immensely obvious in the book--is that they ARE a potential victim.  Escobedo committed upwards of 100 rapes, and even managed to maintain some \\"normal\\" relationships on the side...even going so far as to initiate not only an intimate relationship, but also a business relationship with an unsuspecting woman who, coincidentally, was previously one of his victims.  She never even knew until he was finally arrested.  You really can't make this stuff up.	2003-03-17

It is simple almost to a childish level, which some people--snugly wrapped up in their intellectualism--may find offensive, but it is written in the way God would have wanted it.  God wants a relationship with everyone...not just intellectuals.  It may be a good book for those just starting on their walk with God, but also for those who have been walking with Him for years, as it will remind them that God is, in essence, a very simple and approachable Being.  If God ever seems too complicated to understand, it is because we have, in our own minds, complicated Him.	2003-03-12

There are an abundance of Christians who don't know exactly what to do.  It is not unusual for someone to came back from an altar call thinking &quot;Now what?&quot;.  This book holds that answer.  Especially interesting was the very last chapter dealing with the common separation of spiritual and secular activities, in which Tozer explains that there does not have to be, indeed, should not be any distinction.  All acts, whether commonly thought of as spiritual or secular, can and should be holy. These acts, executed with the proper motive will be happily accepted by God as acts of holiness, regardless of their seeming insignificance to others.	2003-03-10

I like the fact that he refuses to make any excuses for criminals (coming from a dysfunctional family, childhood abuse, insanity, etc.)  He makes it very clear that regardless of a person's background or previous experiences, the execution of a crime is always voluntary....that the criminal made a choice to disregard the consequences of his actions, and inflict consequences on an innocent victim.  The only thing I didn't really care for too much in this book was the fact that so little was devoted to actual criminal profiling.  Most of the book is dedicated to victim's rights and how to prevent yourself from becoming a victim.  While there is nothing wrong with such topics, and he does make some very excellent points, I felt a little bit shortchanged after becoming intrigued with the coverage of criminal psychology...intrigued enough to look into it further as a possible career, and then the rest of the book jumps into victim's rights and never looks back.	2003-03-09

It is a continuation of the Phantom of the Opera (which I had not read, but am currently in the process of doing so).  The characters are very real and believable, although the story itself is somewhat far-fetched.  The tale is told from the perspectives of several different people, and is told masterfully, without losing any continuity.  If you've not read Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, you should do so before reading this book, as the story is almost completely based on previous happenings.  If you have read it, then go ahead and pick this one up....it will leave you wishing for more.	2003-02-15

Something that most people forget about or just plain ignore in today's world of hustle and bustle.  Something that Thomas Merton rediscovered and has shared with us.  The Seven Storey Mountain takes us through the life of Thomas Merton, from his childhood all the way to his acceptance at a Trappist monastery in Kentucky.  Throughout it all, Thomas examines his life in full detail, revealing what most people don't want to admit about their own lives....that they alone are responsible for their own unhappiness.  As he realizes just how miserable and empty his life really is, he notices that all along God had been calling him to something greater...a life full of peace, happiness, and contemplation.  And like every one of us, the only requirement for this life is to simply accept it.  Sometimes confusing due to the fact that he was a Catholic and I am not, this book was still an incredibly enlightening and thoroughly enjoyable book.  After reading this book, you will likely look forward to carving some time out of your busy day to simply sit and ponder the wonders of God, which coincidentally, is when you will finally hear God speaking to you.	2003-01-26

The Basque truly are a unique and noble people with many things to teach the rest of the world.

Albert Camus tells the story from the perspective of a doctor living in that town.  Having never personally lived in a town that was quarantined, I cannot verify the factuality of the story, but the picture Camus draws is truly scary.  He recounts the doctor's daily experiences from the first few signs of the plague, to the entire town in a panic and uproar, all the way to the plague's mysterious disappearance.  It is somewhat gruesome in parts, so if you get a little queasy, this book may not be for you, but if you are interested in how humanity overall faces the prospect of impending death, and it's helplessness before the reaper, this will prove to be an enlightening study.	2003-01-01

One would think that since the publisher released the book several months late, they might have used that extra time to proofread.  The number of typographical errors truly astounded me, and made the book difficult, if not agonizing, to read.  There is very little actual text, as this is primarily a picture book.  While the pictures are of fine quality and brought back many memories, I noticed that the captions didn't always match up with the pictures.  And while the brightly colored pages did make a visually interesting background, it also made the tiny type rather difficult to read.  Overall, there is very little to learn from this book, and anyone who is interested in food history would be better served by one of the many other books already on the market.	2003-01-01

The back of the book asks us &quot;How can we trust him if we don't know him?&quot;  And after reading the book, I still don't really know him.  The book is written in a Q&amp;A interview format, with frequent and annoying interjections from other people, usually his wife.  While the information gathered from the other people in Putin's life may be interesting or even useful, it would have been better left to its own chapter, as the interjections usually had nothing to do with the topic at hand.  The book, as you might suspect is very heavily biased toward Putin.  Of course Putin isn't going to point out his faults.  According to him, he is a humble and nearly perfect leader who only wants to help his people without any kind of consideration for himself, and anyone who says otherwise is a flat-out liar.  When asked about specific missions and programs during his stint in the KGB, he of course denies any knowledge or participation, sometimes even denying that the mission or program ever existed, in spite of evidence to the contrary.  Typical KGB....deny deny deny.  The book's stated mission was to let us get to know Putin better, and therefore trust him more, and yet it presents only his side of every story, and presents it as the infallible truth.  A little objectivity would have been nice.  Can we trust him?  Not without more information.	2002-12-09

Boy was I wrong!  An education at the hallowed CIA is more like an initiation into hell that only a true masochist would enjoy.  Call me sick, but I still want to go.  In this book, Michael doesn't just walk through the classes, observing what the students are doing.  He actually becomes a student, going through the same gruelling schedule, and the same humiliating criticisms that the other students experience.  How else could he paint such a vibrant picture of life at the CIA?  You will experience all the highs and lows that Michael and his fellow students experience.  Especially amusing was when Chef Pardus shamed Michael into coming into class during a dangerous snowstorm.  Chef Pardus had basically intimated that being a chef isn't for everyone, (chefs ALWAYS get where they need to be when they need to be there) and that perhaps Michael just wasn't cut out to be one of those chosen few.  The reader actually feels Michael's outrage, and can't help root for him, as he sets out to prove Chef Pardus wrong with his new determination to experience every morsel of hardship that his fellow students are forced to swallow.  This singular event haunts him throughout most of the rest of the book, and I suspect, still does so today.  Of special interest is when Michael notices how studying to be a chef actually changes how one operates in everyday life.  You forever look toward maximum efficiency, and look down with disgust on any wasted movements, even when not in the kitchen.  While not meant to be an instructional book, this book is very likely to make you a better cook, simply by inspiring you to accept nothing less than perfection in your own kitchen.	2002-12-08

Filled with anecdotes and recipes from several of Texas' most famous pitmasters, this book is quite an enjoyable and informative read.  Many of the recipes actually look interesting enough to try.  Some of these recipes won't likely be found in many other books, for example, barbacoa (cow head) or lengua (tongue), either because of the difficulty in obtaining the ingredients or because of their potential to nauseate the uninitiated in the ways of true Q.  But these are the ones that I find most intriguing, and are the ones that I am most eager to try.  While the stories are amusing, and the photos really help bring them to life, the recipes are definitely not for the novice.  There are many conflicting methods and theories contained inside the book, and I believe that is intentional.  Robb Walsh is not trying to pull one over on you, he is simply trying to be an objective writer and present all the possibilities so that the reader can make his/her own informed choices.  For example, some pitmasters swear by wrapping a brisket in foil for the last few hours, while others claim it turns the brisket into an unappetizing mush (I fall into the latter camp).  Someone who is just learning the fine art of Q could very easily become confused and discouraged by the wealth of conflicting information.  I would advise learning at least the basics of Q before taking anything in this book to heart.  You should have a firm grasp of how the Q process works, and know how you like your own Q first.  Then this book will give you new ideas...you can simply discard any information that conflicts with your own personal experiences and go from there.	2002-12-07

It explains basic kitchen terminology and methods in very basic terms....even a child could understand them.  If you have much kitchen experience at all, you probably won't learn a whole lot from this book, but it does serve me well as a reference book.  For example, if I can't remember exactly how long or how hot to bake a potato, I turn to Cooking for Dummies.  It's recipes also serve as a wonderful jumping off point for developing your own cooking creativity.  The recipes are very basic, and can always be changed or doctored up to your own tastes.	2002-12-05

All the way from Ancient China to today, the amount of information presented is quite impressive.  I never would have thought there could have been so much information or history regarding such a humble seasoning.  Not only has salt sustained many economies throughout the world, not only has it been battled over, but it has also, quite literally, changed the face of the earth, through collapsing salt mines and brine wells.  Mark also includes many recipes throughout the book, representative of the times in which the text is exploring.  A couple of the more notable recipes include one for a Salt Cod Apple Pie, and a recipe for ham that was used by Thomas Jefferson's family.  The most intriguing thing I learned, though, is that even today, salt is made basically the exact same way it was made thousands of years ago....either by mining solid salt, or by boiling brine or seawater.  While the book can be a bit slow in parts, overall, it was interesting, and definitely worthwhile reading for any foodie or history buff.	2002-12-05

Mary Mallon a.k.a. \\"Typhoid Mary\\" was a cook not unlike Bourdain himself, thus he is especially qualified to speak on her behalf.  Most other books regarding the subject matter are either epidemiological in nature, treating her as just another case history, or historical in nature, viewing her as just another in a long line of events and placing a vast gulf between the reader and Mary herself.  Bourdain comes at it with a biographical bent.  There is no science here.  The author wants you to feel Mary's pain, her persecution (perceived or otherwise), her frustration with not being able to do the one thing she knew how to do in order to make a living, and Anthony does a wonderful job of it.  It is a very quick read, but well worth it.	2002-12-04

The many anecdotes will not only bring back many fond memories, but will also shed some light on parts of his life that most people don't know about.  For example, he wasn't really drunk up there in that booth.  He was just acting so fans could relate.  Harry was always one for showmanship, and he was one of the best at it.  If you miss Harry, you need to read this...it will help.	2002-11-30
US	52507046	RSELM9CC9WCJD	0800871863	431949761	Silence	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Very Thought Provoking	In this book, Shusaku Endo presents the reader with a story of a priest who travels to Japan during a time of great persecution.  While a great reference, Foxe's Book of Martyrs has nothing on this.  Rather than tell the story of martyrs, Shusaku brings them to life.  He paints a very clear and realistic picture of the exquisite pain visited upon adherents of the faith.  The overriding moral question in this book relates to the priest when he is brought in to apostatize.  There are already several Japanese villagers hanging upside down in a pit of excrement, enduring days of this torture.  These people have already apostatized, but are being left there to entice Father Rodrigues to apostatize.  So what would you do?  Would you renounce your faith, if only with your mouth, to spare the lives of people who already renounced their's?  Would you throw away a lifetime of study, training, and devotion, and concede to living a life in which you must forever deal with the shame of doing so, and are forced to continually apostatize by fabricating arguments that refute your faith?	2002-11-29

If you are serious about learning chess, this book is for you!  It is laid out very well, each lesson building on the ones before it.  This book primarily covers the rules of chess and piece movement.  But even those who already know how to play may benefit from reading this book and completing the homework assignments.  This is the first of a series of books that comprise the Comprehensive Chess Course, so even if you already understand the basics of chess, it would not be a bad idea to go through this one before moving on to the more advanced books.  This way you will benfit from the very basic building blocks of the Russian system, and hopefully won't become lost or mired down in the later volumes because you never learned to think the way the Russians do.	2002-11-25

This book is layed out logically, progressively building on previous material.  It will leave a complete newcomer with a basic understanding of the rules of the game, and some basic mating patterns.  Anyone who is more than a rank beginner will be extremely bored with this book, and probably somewhat upset about spending their money on it.	2002-11-25

Some may complain that it is too Franco-centric, but all fine food has evolved from the French, so why shouldn't it be written that way?  If you actually have to look up meatloaf, you probably don't belong in the kitchen.  So be warned....this book IS only for truly serious cooks.

Being emperor, while thought to be a cushy arrangement, was actually one of the most dangerous jobs at the time.  Needless to say, most people didn't hang on to the position for long.  Intra-family murders and marriages, poisonings, insanity, cowardice, conceit, and sheer incompetence led to the early demise of most Roman rulers.  The illustrations that accompany each account are absolutely hilarious!  Recommended reading for anyone who has an interest in ancient Roman history.	2002-11-24

Her balance of recipes and anecdotes make this one of the few cookbooks out there that you could actually sit down and read cover to cover without actually preparing any of the food, and still come away feeling like you've gained something.  Most of the recipes are very simple and easy to put together, as most Bistro food is, and yet quite delicious.  Of special interest to the Francophile is the appendix listing many of Patricia's favorite Bistros throughout France.	2002-11-24

In Kitchen Confidential, Tony will take you from his first experiences with cooking all the way to his experiences at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) and on to his professional career.  Packed with many disturbing anecdotes, this memoir will show how &quot;odd&quot; the people who work in food service really are.  He also explains several secrets for getting the best food at a restaurant and what pitfalls to avoid to prevent you from getting the absolutely worst food (don't buy the fish on Monday, don't order your steak well-done, etc.).  If you have any interest in getting into the food service industry, you simply MUST read this first, in order to get an idea of what you are really getting into.  As Tony explains, the real world of cooking is absolutely nothing like what you see on T.V. with all those celebrity chef shows.  The real world kitchen is much tougher and grittier, and certainly isn't for just anyone.	2002-11-24

It is truly amazing what an impact cod has had on our world.  What at first seems to be a fairly insignificant little fish with an unappetizing name, is shown to be the entire driving force of the economy of several different nations and communities.  Mark explains the importance of cod to the world economy, why wars have been fought directly and indirectly over cod, how the cod trade not only supported but also perpetuated the slave trade, and the ramifications of greedily over-fishing.  This book is highly recommended for anyone who has any kind of interest in where their food came from, even if they've never eaten cod before.  Many things about the cod industry have parallels in other food insustries, such as beef, pork, and poultry production.	2002-11-07

None of the garnishes are very difficult, but they contribute so much to the eye appeal of any meal, and subconsciously, they contribute to the taste.  (If it looks good, your mind subconsciously tells you it is good.)  I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to add just a little flair to their meals, but doesn't want to have to learn any fancy knife cuts or buy any special equipment/blades.	2002-11-02

While this may be the case, after reading Animal Farm, the reader will understand why crying out for change is generally pointless, because of the fact that everyone is innately self-serving, and given the power to help themselves, everyone will do just that.  Animal Farm does a very good job of explaining how it is true that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.	2002-11-02

This book is divided into three different sections.  The first recounts his experiences as an observer during the administration of the Culinary Institute of America's (CIA) Certified Master Chef (CMC) exam, a rigorous and controversial test of a chef's knowledge and ability.  Michael does a wonderful job of communicating the pressure of taking this test.  In the second part of the book, Michael gives the reader a taste of what it is like to actually be in the trenches of the restaurant industry as he spends some time with an up and coming culinary star named Michael Symon.  In the third part, Michael travels to Yountville, California to visit Thomas Keller and his restaurant French Laundry, arguably the best restaurant in the country and possibly the world.  Reading this book may possibly inspire the reader on to further culinary excellence in his/her own kitchen, and will certainly inspire a certain amount of physical hunger.  Fortunately, Michael also includes an appendix containing several recipes gleaned from his experiences in each section of the book.	2002-10-27

Robert Stearns has written a wonderful book about the ways in which today's church is changing, and the ways in which it still needs to change.  He writes in a manner that makes it very difficult not to be excited about  the times we are living in as Christians.  It should give all believers  much hope and joy.  The &quot;What Now?&quot; section at the end of every  chapter is a very nice touch.  It lets the reader see how one might apply  the reading to one's life, as an individual, or as part of a group. Having  read the book, I feel the title, &quot;Prepare the Way&quot;, is not just a  commandment, but more of a simple statement.  The Lord WILL prepare the  way, with or without us, but how much better is it to be a part of the  master plan, rather than to just sit on the sidelines, comfortable in our  own salvation, watching from a distance?	1999-11-25
