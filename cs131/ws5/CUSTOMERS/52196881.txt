This is another compilation of essays in a long series chronicling his fishing life and the issues that have impact upon it. <br />His first book, Trout Bum, established his persona...a trout-obsessed fly-fisher who puts everything in life second to the sport. Whether or not this is actually true we don't know, but I suspect that it is pretty much accurate. Unlike most of the bums that I've known(ski bums, golf bums, bass bums) Gierach has managed to make a living from his obsession.  I guess that this is a good thing for him...it certainly is good for his readers!	2003-09-01

In the course of the book we learn a little about the author, lots about the business of horse breeding and meet some of the big players in the industry. <br />Comparisons to the recent book about Seabiscuit (which is better) are unavoidable and probably unfair. &quot;Horse of a Different Color&quot; covers a different territory and is as much about a business as a single horse.<br />The book has a few faults.  At times, Squires gets stuck in arcane detail that interrupts the flow of the narrative.  Also, his device of referring to himself in the third person(e.g. &quot;the breeder&quot; or &quot;the genius&quot;) and his wife as &quot;the dominant female&quot; are at first wierd and then become tedious. They are odd mis-steps for an ex-newspaper editor to make.	2003-06-29

He talked various big names (e.g. Nicklaus, Daly, Lehman, Trump)into a short-term caddy hitch. Unlike Plimpton, Reilly does not spend much time recording his own struggles and observations, which in his case is probably a good thing. Essentially this book is a collection of interviews and anecdotes collected with a bag on his shoulder.<br />Apparently Reilly is a big shot sportswriter at Sports Illustrated (I switched to a better barber shop and haven't seen SI in 10 years) and has received a number of awards for his writing.  I wouldn't have thought it.  In the current volume he sprays pseudo-Southern similies like a drunken Dan Rather and plain wore out this pore old reader by the middle of the book.<br />Is it all bad?  No,not at all.  A fascinating chapter on high stakes golf gamblers covered new territory and the John Daly chapter was a more gentle and revealing account than usual. The translations of caddy-jabber are fun.<br />Get this book for your next flight across the country.  Its perfect at 35,000ft.	2003-05-28

The author of this volume, Tremper Longman III, is a professor at Westmont College in California and was previously on the faculty of Westminster Seminary.  <br />The commentary is arranged by chapters and contains sections on the original meaning of the text, the context in relation to the whole Bible, and contemporary significance of the text. His writing is easy to comprehend and pleasant to read.  The book would work equally well as reference or as a group Bible study.<br />Longman is solidly reformed.  He resists the temptation to use the prophesy in Daniel to set specific dates for the end-times.  In fact, he has publicly debated Harold Camping on just this issue.  Although not directly addressed, his traditional approach effectively answers the error promoted by dispensationalists.	2003-02-23

The topics are compelling and the treatment is thorough.<br />The sole (minor) weakness is McPhee's irritating tendency to use a big word where a little one will do just fine, make the obscure allusion, and use occasional similies that distract rather than illustrate.  This problem is not seen in his more recent writing, so he either has seen the error of his ways or gotten a strong editor.	2003-01-08

The book focuses on the last leg of Flagler's railroad that crossed ocean and swamp to connect Key West with the mainland.<br />The book seems more like an expanded magazine piece rather than a thorough treatment of this fascinating man and his amazing project.<br />Yes, buy the book, but don't expect a Steven Ambrose-like treatment of the subject (considering my opinion of Ambrose's writing ability this is faint praise indeed).	2003-01-08

The author clearly knows his stuff and communicates it well.<br />The only weakness is the limited and low quality photography (lots of depth of field problems) which, I gather is not the author's work, but came from a wildflower society. There really are far too few pictures considering the wide variety of plants. Don't plan on being able to tell which of the diverse Eupatoriums or Asters you want to plant by looking at their pictures.<br />HOWEVER, this book would be worth it without pictures, just for the information.

For those not familiar with The Talk of the Town feature in the New Yorker, it is a short, 1000 word-or-so essay on some feature of the current NY scene. The writing is often clever(rarely, too clever eg Garrison Keillor, but this could be predicted) and many great writers have taken a turn at it.<br />Part of the charm of the volume are the older pieces where now-famous names and places are introduced as newcomers and one gets a real feel of Manhattan in the 20s and 30s.	2002-10-31

Fortunately this one is well-written indeed. The first half of it deals with the author's coming of age as an academic and transition into a food writer. The second half of the book mainly consists of accounts of famous chefs and famous diners whose lives have intersected with his.<br />Villas is a outspoken (and perceptive) critic of nouvelle cuisine, fusion and all of the unfortunate food-foolishness of the past couple of decades. He savages some big-time chefs like Wolfgang Puck and is simply dismissive of many more famous names. <br />The author is also a creature from another time, say the 1930s, and is a terrible(wonderful?) snob. More than anything he reminds me of Lucius Beebe, a mid-century American bon vivant who managed to live a gilded life and then write about it.<br />The book misses occasionally when Villas gets a little too bitchy, but perhaps these slight lapses are as revealing as the more elegant parts. An interesting and somewhat disturbing revelation is just how many food writers live lonely and seemingly desperate lives. Perhaps only the ones in New York are this way.	2002-10-04

The habits, landscape value, propagation and culture of most( a few are missing) of the important plants are described in a very readable manner. Cullina clearly draws from a deep well, I had the impression that he had much more that he could have included, but what is here is great.<br />There are a couple of criticisms. The photos are relativly sparse compared to the recent books by Dirr or Darke and are not at all well-reproduced. One picture per genus just ain't enough when there is such wonderful variation within genera. Also, the pronunciation guide for Latin plant names is occasionally bizarre...since when does \\"Aesculus\\" have four syllables? (But maybe he is right I couldn't find any native Latin speakers to ask) Finally, the book has a clear East coast bias. Although there are many Western US plants that are mentioned, I suspect that many are missing.<br />Buy this book for the prose.	2002-09-20

Darke's approach is unique; part Edwin Way Teale and part Gertrude Jeckyl, he looks at woodland beauty from many aspects; both for the love of it and in order to reproduce it in the garden. The book has four main sections, an appreciation of natural plant arrangements in the forest, a study of a small section of a woodland creek over many years, application of natural design principles in established gardens and a description of horticulturally useful forest plants. Each section is lavishly illustrated with beautiful and well-reproduced photographs.<br />In the first unit, the author looks at natural woodlands and natural gardens from the point of view of an artist and gardener. His goal is to define those natural combinations that are pleasing and translate them to culture. His discussion of color was particularly novel and helpful.<br />The second section follows the changes wrought by nature in a section of the Red Clay Creek in SE Pennsylvania. Not merely a catalog of events, this exercise in observation reveals how natural beauty evolves over time and through the seasons.<br />In the third section, a number of public and private gardens are used to illustrate the authors vision of the narural garden.<br />Finally, the last part of the book describes the main plants in the northeastern forest. It contains a wealth of cultural and aesthetic information.<br />Each section alone is worth the price of this handsome volume. This is a garden book to savor and to learn from.	2002-09-13

Well, it really isn't.<br />Good things can be found here; for example culinary nuggets scattered through the book about how to cook bacon, prepare citrus zest etc are interesting and useful.  A glimpse at the business side of the restaurant is novel but underdeveloped. <br />My major criticisms are three...I didn't get to know Daniel Boulud at all. Many opportunities to flesh him out were missed...there are a zillion frequently seen people in the kitchen, but most are so undeveloped that I couldn't keep 'em straight....There is far too much random kitchen chatter reproduced.

The concept isn't new (see the Westminster Confession) but is well worth remembering.  We are supposed to enjoy being christians and to take joy in what God likes.<br />The problem with Desiring God is that it is not well written. There are several problems.  First, Piper seems to have transcribed sermons and turned them into chapters.  This never reads well.  Second, there are many awkward similies/illustrations that distract rather than illuminate. Third, Piper runs out of topic fairly early in each chapter, but the chapters chug onward anyway. Finally, the phrase &quot;Christian Hedonist&quot; appears so frequently that I began to wonder if he had trademarked it and was coming out with a line of clothing.<br />An editor could have helped immeasurably.	2002-05-13

Some of the great UK and US gardens are examples and Jekyl, Luytens and Wright are a few recognizable practitioners of the style.  The concept is to link the garden to the associated buildings in a manner consistent with the locale.  Yes, that is a mouthful, but it is one worth chewing-on a bit if you've tired of the typical garden and the now-trite garden book.<BR>  Although perhaps easiest to envision at a large estate, the principles presented are easily adapted to smaller gardens and I have found it helpful to have a philosophy to undergird my planning and planting.<BR>  Darke writes clearly and well, presenting his thesis in an enjoyable way.
