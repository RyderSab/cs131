Orphaned after her parents were murdered, she is raised by the professor's at Oxford, under the sponsorship of her Uncle, the distant and troubling Lord Asriel. Lyra loves her life at Oxford, she, her daemon Pantalaimon or \\"Pan\\" for short, and her best friend Roger run wild, tormenting the kitchen staff, waking the ghosts of deceased Oxford dons, and warring with the gypsy children.<br /><br />Then, the children of Oxford begin to disappear. Rumors of \\"Gobblers\\" begin to circulate, and Lyra and her friend Roger are both veryfrightened, but also intent on soving the mystery. But with each answer found, more questions spring up: who are the \\"Gobblers\\"? and what of these \\"severed children\\" Uncle Asriel talked about? And why are the oxford Dons trying to do away with Asriel? Lyra and Roger dedicate themselves to tracking down these answers, until the \\"Gobblers\\" reach Oxford - and one of their own goes missing.<br /><br />Then it's a race to the North. Asriel is taken prisoner by the Panzerbjorn - yes, that's \\"Armored Bear\\" - but how much he has them prisoner is uncertain. Lyra is taken under the wing of the lovely Mrs. Coulter, but then runs away when she finds out that Mrs.Coulter is not as lovely as she seems. She and Roger pair up with the gypsies, accompanied by a witch clan from the north, and they meet Iorek  Byrnnison, dethroned monarch of the Panzerbjorn. It's one adventure after the next after the next . . .and that's only half way through the first book.<br /><br />My heart never stopped racing reading these books. Lyra is a character wholely unlike any that I have met in any fantasy novel. It is so rare to come across a young heroine who has such an unconquerable, adventurous spirit; a girl, who though she finds any excuse to get out of her studies, is as smart as a whip, who cares so deeply for people and yet has such an insatiable sense of vengeance, whose curioisity never ends, and who can find trouble around any corner, and save the day at the last minute (I think that was a whole lot of mixed metaphors there, but you get the message.)<br /><br />And there are other amazing characters as well - the fierce Panzerbjorn with their armor of Sky iron, and the witch clans, who can cross into different worlds at will. The Gallavespians were by far my favorite - tiny blue bings no bigger than a hand, who ride on dragonflies and can fit into the smallest cranny to spy on anything, but who are burdened by a lifespan of only ten years.<br /><br />These books are incredibly complex, beautiful works of fantasy,a dn though they are kept often in teh YA section of bookstores, may be frightening for children younger than 12.

The novela tells the story of an upperclass British family that travels to Italy to save the son of their late daughter-in-law from a savage upbringing by his Italian father, their daughter-in-laws second husband. There aren't a whole lot of happy moments in the novella - on the whole it's pretty depressing, but it was never boring, and the characters, some lovable, some completely aggravating, were at least interesting. Having never read any other works by E.M. Forster, I am not cut out to comment on style, but knowing that this was his first work makes me really want to read his later novels - this was great for a first effort, so I'm sure his more mature work is fantastic.	2005-10-02

Five years later, though, it was an aside from a professor during a  lecture on Nabokov that convinced me to pick it up again.<br /><br />This was the first novel that I'd read where I truly felt an inner conflict brewing - but in a good way. Lady Chatterly's Lover, though banned for its immorality on its publication, is a book that will force a person to question their own morality and moral judgements, and perhaps rethink them.<br /><br />It is a story of a young woman married to an older man who is confined to a wheel chair due to a war wound. Her husband and she have a respectful relationship, though she does not love him, and though he may love her, he is not particularly attentive. To cure her boredom and satisfy her libido, she turns to adultery. Her first lover is a egotistical Irish writer, but she leaves him quickly over \\"performance\\" issues. She finds herself attracted to Oliver, the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. They continue the affair under the nose of her husband, who, afraid that she will leave him, pretends not to notice.<br /><br />Lawrence's writing is sublime, to say the least. His descriptions  of the estate are picture perfect, and each scene is told almost cinematically. The characters are perfectly developed; you can feel Lady Chatterly's inner turmoil in the beginning of the novel as she copes with caring for her husband and her unsatisfied libido, without any social outlets but her husband's friends. As she begins her affair with Oliver, you notice how that tension that she held is slowly released - and how her husband, paralyzed and coping with a wife who spends less and less time with him, absorbs this tension. Beautiful read.	2005-09-28

I am not a professional writer at all, though I like to write short stories for fun, and picked this up at the local bookstore to help improve my writing skills.<br /><br />  I think that Ms. Lamott's advice is not only relevant to those who want to write, but to anyone pursuing anything creative, and really, anyone alive.<br /><br />  This book, first of all, is about writing. And Lamott gives some of the best advice that I've heard. Though I only write for fun, and not to get published, I think that my writing has vastly improved after reading this book; I never felt comfortable before showing anyone my work, and now it's become something that I'm proud of enough to share with friends.<br /><br />  This book is also, last of all, is about overcoming your inner demons to put something beautiful - or, if not beautiful, at least useful - into the world. A lot of the book centers on self-esteem, or lack there of, but not in a cheesy, self-help kind of way. It addresses love of self not as an act of getting over your faults or learning to love them, but learning to transcend your imperfections - and using them to your advantage. Lamott is also realistic - \\"you're probably not going to ever get published\\", she notes, but adds that it has nothing to do with you.<br /><br />  I read this book whenever I need inspiration for a new piece of writing, or whenever I need a laugh, or I need someone to tell me not to take myself so seriously.

While not always completely practical (but one could get around this by learning to substitute canned chicken stock for her homemade, etc.), the recipes always work, and 99% of the time they taste good.<br /><br />  I have tried many recipes in this cookbook since I first got it 8 or so years ago, and I have been pleased with all of them (especially her soup recipes, which are always delicious). I have made many of them for company, and my guests have always enjoyed them. (The Summer tomato risotto is a favorite recipe when the temperature here begins to rise).<br /><br />  That said, these are not all \\"authentic\\" recipes - this cookbook, I'm sure, was a Herculean effort in and of itself to put together, and tracking down truly authentic recipes would probably have been more work. This cookbook should really have been called \\"Restaurant Recipes from All Around the World and Recipes inspired by International Dishes\\" (or something to that effect.) If you are looking for truly authentic dishes, this is not the book to go to - I would simply pay for cookbooks by native chefs from the countries that you are interested in - but if you are interested in easy, delicious recipes by Sheila Lukins and her friends, a sort of continuation of the Silver Palate cookbook, then this is for you.	2005-09-26

There are a lot of loose ends to be tied up from the Subtle Knife, and I was worried that Pullman wouldn't be able to do it properly - even in the 500+ pages that he  had. Not only are all of the questions posed in the first two books answered - Pullman is able to introduce new characters just as complex as those in the first two novels, (How AWESOME are the Gallavespians? And how SCARY was Father Gomez?), and yet finish off the trilogy with all of the characters fully realized, and every question answered. My heart was racing with anticipation of the next event in the novel until the very end - liek the other books in the trilogy, I couldn't put this one down.<br /><br />  Some reviews have mentioned dissappointment with the ending, and this, to some extent, is understandable. However, I think that it is important to remember that in every fantasy novel, in every fantastical universe, no matter how fantastical a universe it may be, there are rules. I loved the universe that Pullman was able to create with these novels, and he was consistant with the rules of his imaginary universe to the very end - a very difficult but important task for a writer of fantasy, and a sign of true genius in a writer who can pull it off.<br /><br />  I hear that Tom Stoppard is writing the screenplay, and I can't wait.	2005-09-26

After reading the first three vignettes, I bought this as his birthday present. When I got home, I had to read the rest. I was laughing outloud the whole time.<br /><br />  Nicholas and his friends have normal, everyday, little boy adventures - giving substitute teachers a hard time, playing cowboys and Indians, getting their school pictures taken - and they get in trouble, like all free-spirited little boys do, but the stories are told with such innocence and such wit, that everyday events become the best of comic relief. I bought a copy for my cousin, Nicholas, but I think that I'll have to get another for myself. I can't wait for the next volume! A great book for little boys and grown-ups.	2005-09-26

Believe it or not, I've even been saving money AND dressing better. The majority of Ms. Dariaux's advice is priceless. Before finishing her book, I spent way too much money on clothes, had way too many of them because I never threw anything out or gave anything away, but I never felt like I had anything to wear. After finishing her book, I went through my wardrobe and gave atleast four trash bags worth of clothing to good will, keeping only a few pieces. I never feel over or underdressed, and I haven't regretted a clothing purchase (of which I'd made very few) since.<br /><br />  I never felt I would take anything so seemingly frivolous so seriously - but I did, and it has paid off.	2005-09-26

Mr. Norrell is a aging, dull, stingy scholar of magic and practical  magician; he has been holed up at his estate, Hurtfew Abbey, for nearly all of his adult life, until an argument with a magical society in York entices himself to make himself useful to the English government.<br /><br />Jonathan Strange never intended to be anything but independently wealthy, or a \\"gentleman\\" as they would say. But boredom and a prophecy from a London street-tramp turn his interest towards the magical arts. Mr. Norrell hears about this young upstart magician, and takes him on as a pupil.<br /><br />All goes well for a time - but Mr. Norrell is an extremely secretive man, and cannot trust any one enough to share all that he knows about magic, and so Jonathan Strange must strike out on his own.<br /><br />This is threatening to Mr. Norrell for many reasons - his incredible ego cannot take it - how could Strange ever leave him? But what is more troublesome is that Norrell is hiding a dark secret - one that could damage English Magic for good.<br /><br /> If you enjoy reading any of the following: Fantasy novels, historical fiction, a good love story, a novel with: characters that walk a fine line between good and evil, that resembles Jane Austen, Anthony Trollope, or any other Victorian author of social comedies, a good war story, or evil men who meet fates worse than death, this book is for you.	2005-09-25

I have to be honest, though, I've only skimmed over the memoir section. Having read enough similar memoirs of urbanites moving to the country, it wasn't anything too remarkable. I do admire Ms. Bone's grit, though, and her recipes are great.<br /><br />  With that said, there are an overwhelming number of recipes featuring cilantro. And lime. This seems out of place, since, as a previous reviewer noted, this book is being promoted by slow-foodies. Slow food doesn't necessarily mean that if you live in Colorado, you can't cook with cilantro or lime, but I'm pretty sure that neither of these ingredients are native to Colorado, (I could be wrong. I've not researched this thoroughly.) the combination reminiscent of Mexican and South-East Asian Cooking, and I feel that the frequency of use of these ingredients is at odds with a philosophy that emphasizes local produce. With that said, the recipes are great. She provides many delicious recipes for things like stuffed chile peppers and zucchini flowers which were delicious. There are also some very interesting Italian-inspired preparations of ingredients that Ms. Bone finds available near her ranch. I think that this would be a good addition to any cookbook collection.	2005-05-30

You cannot lay it open on the counter to glance at while you go about preparing a recipe. However, I feel that this book is less about recipes and more about technique. If you are the kind of person who enjoys reading cookbooks to learn new techniques to use in the kitchen, this book is very useful. If you want a book to prop up on the counter while you cook, it is not. I would also note that \\"A Book of Mediterrenean Food\\" is a good source of culinary history and an interesting read if you want to know more about where dishes have come from.<br /><br />  Many of the recipes are very simple, with few ingredients. Having read her recipe for Gazpacho, I can tell that it is wholely different than the Gazpacho that I am use to making - there is very little seasoning, and the recipe relies less on herbs and spices and more on the natural flavors of the ingredients - and to prepare Ms. David's recipe will require extremely fresh, high quality vegetables. This appears to be true of many of the recipes in this book.<br /><br />  I thoroughly enjoy Ms. David's writing. She is sharp and witty, even writing about something as mundane as soup. I am very happy that I purchased this book, and I'm sure that I will refer back to it for recipes and techniques for a long time.	2005-05-29

I feel that Guterson had a great idea for a story, but didn't take the time to allow that story to reach its full potential.

I was a little disappointed at the publishers reviews as well as the blurb on the back of the book - I felt as though it gave away a bit too much of the story. Japrisot, however, leaves the reader in complete suspense until the end of the novel. There were parts where the story dragged a bit - about forty percent is told in the form of letters to the main character, and some of these letters should have been two or three pages shorter. I also had a bit of trouble keeping all of the minor  characters straight. In the end I gave this book a five out of five stars for its originality and the strength of the characters.	2004-10-20
US	38952223	R2C5X121MZNW3Z	1400041457	770351241	Without Blood	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Engaging story	Although I did not enjoy Baricco's lastest work as much as his best-seller &quot;Silk&quot;, I found that the three qualities that impressed me the most with &quot;Silk&quot; - form, purity of style and language, and imagery - were employed with equal skill in &quot;Without Blood.&quot;<br />  Told in two chapters, each approximately 45 pages in length, &quot;Without Blood&quot; begins as the story of a young girl who witnesses the assassination of her father and young brother. The assassins, a man named Salinas, his henchman, known only as &quot;El Gurre&quot;, and a young man of twenty named Tito, kill her father and brother, and then realizing that she mus tbe hidden somewhere in the house, burn it to the ground.<br />  In the second half of the novel, an old woman seeks out a final revenge.<br />  Like his work &quot;Silk&quot;, &quot;Without Blood&quot; has a simple story. It is not the plot, but the immensely deep and tragic characters that make the novella great. The only problem that I had with the novella is during hte dialogue, Baricco inserts pauses that made it very hard to determine who was speaking, and it is only for this reason that I did not give it five stars.	2004-07-17
US	38952223	R1HEKYMJM1LA17	0375703829	22806037	Silk	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Beautifully written	The first thing that struck me about Alessandro Baricco's novella \\"Silk\\" was its structure - the form is 100% pure - no words are unnecessary or superfluous. His style is simple and warm, and reads almost like a poem. The story, too, is simple: a silkworm farmer of modest means travels \\"to the end of the world\\" to garner silkworm eggs for the failing silk industry in his small town, and meets a young woman that he cannot get out of his mind. Baricco's form, style, and imagery are what set this story apart.	2004-07-17

I laughed so hard during the first chapter that my stomach hurt, and I didn't stop laughing through the entire book. This was a great summer read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that is both light-hearted and true-to-life.	2004-06-13
