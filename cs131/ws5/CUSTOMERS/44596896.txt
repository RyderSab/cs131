Jessica Casavant is one of the few authors I've followed who is able to keep all books in a series interesting.  'Imperfect Past' is the third book in the Boston Friends series.  After reading the first two books, I wasn't really sure why this was a series at all -- Casavant had some crossover characters, but the story lines did not intersect.  That is also true in this third installment, but her approach has made all the characters more familiar to me; thus giving them more depth and dimensionality.  I feel like I know these women.<br /><br />The back cover of the book insinuates the central plot line is about solving child abduction cases.  However, that is an \\"endcap\\" to the book (i.e., the book opens and closes with it, but isn't relevant to the story between).  The real story centers around Jamie's relationship with her recently-deceased father, her physical magnetism with the prime suspect, and her emotional turmoil when she realizes she's falling in love with her long time best friend.  Seemingly a twisted story line, these elements come together into a great story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  A lesbian classic in the making.	2005-10-07

I read this book on a cold, rainy weekend day; and the story has been in the back of my mind all week.  The tale is compelling, the characters are believable, and the love story is heart wrenching.<br /><br />Growing up with a twin brother, Sarah-Bren Coulter (aka Bren Cordell) learned how to ride and shoot like a man.  She wants to support her Yankee countrymen in the Civil War effort, but as a woman she will have little impact.  As a result, the determined woman disguises herself as a man and enlists as a scout.  After a few years of dedicated service, Bren is shot.  A southern woman, Faith Pruitt, and her son find themselves caring (and falling) for the injured soldier.  Ok... that part you can get from the back cover...<br /><br />This is a great story that addresses women's rights (and how far we've come).  It deals with aspects of coming out in a very unaccepting environment.  It touches on the \\"brother vs. brother\\" aspect of the Civil War.  But, best of all, it draws the reader in and keeps the reader pleasantly (or frustratingly)confused until the very end.<br /><br />Dunne successfully pulls together a myriad of tough topics into a wonderful romance.  This one will stay on my shelf for many years to come.	2005-10-07

I couldn't put it down.  Alex Ryan turns in her badge after her lover, also a cop, is killed right in front of her eyes.  Alex turns away from everything in her life -- her home, her friends, her family -- and essentially becomes a recluse.  Her self-imposed exile is thwarted when she meets her neighbor and landlord, Megan.  Megan doesn't know how to handle her growing attraction toward Alex, but exhibits a maturity everyone should strive for.<br /><br />The supporting characters in this book give it depth and dimensionality.  Megan's grandmother is a comical woman who knows when to intervene.  Alex's friends are invaluable in helping her heal.  Even Kate, the woman who accidentally gets mixed up in a murder investigation and has awakening feelings of lust toward the female cops, is a gem.<br /><br />It is hard not to experience the emotional highs and lows of all the characters.  Casavant brilliantly describes each scene and pulls the reader in so much that smells almost seem real.<br /><br />One note -- 'Walking Wounded' is second book in the Boston Friends Series.  However, these books (there are 3 so far) seem to stand alone as well.  There are minor mentions of characters from the other books ('Twist of Fate' and 'Imperfect Past'), but they don't seem to be sequels or prequels of each other.  This isn't bad if you only have one or two of them on your shelf.  The only negative thing I can say about this book is that it's only 156 pages long.<br /><br />I have the third book, 'Imperfect Past,'  on my shelf and can't wait to start reading.  This is a tremendous series by a priceless author.  Keep 'em coming...	2005-09-25

These attitudes are not a reflection on Kallmaker, but are necessary to tell this compelling story of interracial lesbian love.<br /><br />Anthea Rossignole works in the accounting department at an oil refinery.  She comes from old money and is financially secure.  However, she subjects herself daily to a sexist, condescending, homophobic boss who doesn't have a clue.  The worst part is the entire company seems to be populated with men just like her boss.  To top things off, Anthea's long-time live-in girlfriend has an affair with another woman in their car pool.  Anthea breaks things off, kicks her lover out, and looks for a new car pool.<br /><br />Shay Sumoto, an Asian-American who has just lost her father to lung cancer, has also lost her only source of income as a geologist and is knee deep in debt from his hospital bills.  She goes against everything she believes in and takes a job working for the refinery.  It is there that she meets the seemingly-pretentious Anthea.<br /><br />After breaking through their barriers, these two women discover new love and begin to work through their painful pasts.  In the meantime, Anthea helps Shay uncover and report illegal activities by their employer.  They do this not out of revenge for their treatment, but because they want to do the right thing.<br /><br />This book was first published in 1993.  It amazes me that these attitudes still existed then.  It amazes me even more that they still exist today - although they generally are hidden and denied in polite society.  Read this book, get angry, fall in  love with Shay and Anthea, become a bigger Kallmaker fan.	2005-09-25

From the opening pages to the last sentence, the rider is taken on a emotional roller coaster ride. This reader couldn't put the book down (no kidding... I kept reading while I brushed my teeth before bed and didn't fall asleep until every word was read).<br /><br />Anne Doyle, lawyer extraordinaire, finds herself riding the courthouse elevator with stunning, blonde bike patrol cop Maggie Monahan -- a ride that changes both their lives forever. Although neither has the courage to speak in the elevator, both are distracted by their attraction until Maggie's cop partner, Moocher, steps in and plays Cupid. Anne and Maggie become close quickly and eventually move in together. Maggie even comes out to her strict Catholic family and pays the consequences.<br /><br />The women are inseparable until Maggie is badly hurt during a bad arrest. Anne, unable to handle the emotional turmoil of the situation, distances herself from Maggie. Maggie moves out of their home, unsure of what exactly happened to drive Anne away. Anne can't explain it herself. Brennan outdoes herself bringing everything together from here.<br /><br />An absolute gem. Well written and edited, this book constantly kept me on the edge of my seat. Parts of the story made me want to cry, other parts made me feel like I was in the Elysian Fields. This one is a true classic and will stay on my shelf for many years to come.	2005-09-25

Meghan O'Brien has outdone herself with this incredibly realistic story of falling in love and facing old demons.  Regan O'Riley considers herself the epitome of geekiness, but she's a really cool geek.  She has always been one to seek solitude through her computer and video games.  Her parents never really knew or understood her, but they were always supportive -- that is, when Regan let them be.  Mel Raines is a sexy cop and womanizer.  Her past (mother died young, father is an abusive alcoholic) is better left alone, but that all changes after she meets Regan at a straight bar while at a bachelorette party for her college roommate.  Scared of being just another notch in Mel's headboard, Regan confronts Mel with their situation.  This is a turning point for both of them, and the real beginning of their story.<br /><br />After Mel's cop partner is shot on duty, Regan suggests they go on an extended road trip.  While on the road, both women face demons from their past, but they do it together.  They visit their families, make new friends, and discover the joy of being in love for the first time in their lives.<br /><br />At 282 pages, this book is long enough to tell the whole story of their budding relationship.  O'Brien is masterful in describing every scene from tender glances to maddeningly erotic sex.  The characters' emotions jump off the page, helping the reader feel like they're in the scene too.<br /><br />What a wonderful book!  Here's hoping for more from O'Brien in the not too distant future.	2005-09-25

I'm not a big fan of satire, so did not thoroughly enjoy the humorous side of this book.  However, I was completely drawn into the underlying story.  Bailey, the head writer for a daily soap opera with the same name as the book, seems to have a black cloud over her head.  Her long-time girlfriend dumps her, her sarcastic response to a script change earns her a trip to the \\"Big Guy's\\" office, she is stuck mentoring a useless new writer who is related to a studio bigwig and ends up wreaking havoc, and she has to write off her favorite character.  Of course, she has friends like Peter who want to help, but they only make things worse.  While going through all of this, Bailey doesn't even realize she's falling in love with someone at work until it hits her square in the face.<br /><br />I found this book to be similar in structure / intent as 'Castaway' by Advocate.  The story was great, the characters were fun, but the comedy was a little over-done.  This book is a great lazy-day read, but it won't be a permanent addition to my bookshelf.  Enjoy it and pass it on.	2005-09-13
US	44596896	RY8FBORMAJPA6	1932667121	223715037	Threads of Destiny	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Incredible Comeback...	I was a little disappointed in 'Incommunicado' by Nancy Hill and J.P. Mercer, and was leery of the sequel.  However, I had already bought both and decided to plow ahead.  You'll never know how glad I am that I did.  I'm not sure why, but this sequel is many times better than the original. As far as I could see, it would also be enjoyable on its own (i.e, not necessary to read 'Incommunicado.')<br /><br />The premise of this book follows the first in that it centers around the investigation of drug running and murder across the US/Mexico border, but that's where it ends.  Cara has left Jake because of medical issues related to her rape, but Jake doesn't even know about the rape.  Jake is devestated by the loss of her lover, especially since she doesn't know why things ended.<br /><br />After leaving Jake, Cara returns to her family's vineyard and takes over operations there.  She finds herself facing her first love, Maggie, Maggie's daughter, and her dispicable brothers.  On top of it all, she finds cocaine and discrepancies in the vineyard's books.  Cara contacts the authorities to get help. In the meantime, the heartbroken Jake runs into McKenzie -- one of Cara's former lovers -- and reluctantly begins at least a physical relationship with the woman.  Jake is called in for an undercover assignment, only to find out she will once again see Cara.<br /><br />The investigation is a minor part of this book and the love story is much more out front than in 'Incommunicado.'  The characters have feelings and depth.  This reader could imagine sitting along the wall during the party and participating in the winery tour.  'Destiny' is many times better than 'Incommunicado' and comes highly recommended.  Curl up in your favorite chair with a nice glass of wine and enjoy.  You won't be sorry.	2005-09-05

Alyssa Norland has tried to run away from her past -- a time when she betrayed her then boss, a man with strong mafia ties.  Currently employed as a dog trainer (obedience and protection) and surrounded by new friends, Alyssa appears happy in her new life.  However, after meeting beautiful ex-cop Sue Hunter, her world is forever changed.  Under her confident exterior, Alyssa is paranoid about every new face she meets.  This is especially true after she starts receiving unnerving threats and is framed for committing several almost-deadly crimes against her friends. However, she's nolonger sure who her real friends are.<br /><br />Rickard does a wonderful job with this, her first novel.  The characters have depth, the story is well-told.  This reader \\"screamed\\" at the page (not like a lunatic, but like the guy in the back of the movie theater during a scary scene) during some scenes.  The characters are so real, one could expect them to show up at the next neighborhood barbeque.<br /><br />I'm certainly looking forward to more from this author.  I expect this book to be well read by my friends, but it will stay on my bookshelf for years to come.	2005-09-05

No matter what the circumstances, you never know how your family and friends are going to react.  Faith Fitzgerald has more than her family to face, she also has to reconcile her sexuality with God and the Catholic church.  On top of it all, the person who has most recently stirred her passion is Sydney Van Allen, her boyfriend's sister.<br /><br />Sydney is considering running for Senate and is hoping for backing by the right supporters.  As such, she has cleaned up her life as a recovering alcoholic and is a celibate lesbian.  To make matters worse, she adores her brother, but falls quick and hard for Faith.<br /><br />The women fight their feelings with everything they have, but cannot deny their love for one another.  They disrupt many lives and dispell many aspects of faith, knowing God wants us to love one another.<br /><br />This is by far one of Kallmaker's best books.  As always, she does a masterful job giving the characters depth and dimension.  The story is complete, and there aren't too many distractions from other characters or sub plots.  This one is destined to be a classic and will be on my shelf for many years to come.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2005-09-05

Buddie is reluctant to have a social life because she wants to have as much quality time with Chris as possible.  However, one day during an interview for her radio station, Buddie meets the enigmatic Kate McGowan.  Although Kate insinuates herself into Buddie's life and befriends Chris, Buddie is unsure about their relationship.<br /><br />A hopeful medical treatment for Chris improves her health and allows Buddie the freedom to explore things with Kate.  However, after she realizes she's in love with Kate, Buddie realizes Kate harbors many skeletons in her closet and may never be able to return her love.<br /><br />An intense love story with multiple layers, a strong plot with depth, lovable characters with dimensionality, and an artful author make this a wonderful book.

However, as I kept reading I realized I was in for a great ride.  The book jumps back and forth between three chat rooms (one for most of the story, the other two have minor appearances) and basic text.  The story is broken down into three parts, the first narrated by Alexa, the second by Omen, the third by both.  Although the structure seems a little hard to follow at first, it is not.<br /><br />If you're into S&M, you might enjoy this book (I wouldn't know).  However, even if you're not into S&M, this book is a good story about overcoming ones fears and learning to trust someone.  It's a tantalizing (realistic or not, I don't know) peek into the S&M community.<br /><br />Although 'Venus Online' is a tantalizing ride through cybersex and cyberspace, it is not a raunchy book by any means.  It is tastefully done.  I'm looking foward to finding and reading more books by Alison Tyler.	2005-09-05

Mercer and Hill deliver a somewhat enjoyable, but mostly disappointing collaborative effort.  Half of this book focuses on the love/hate relationship between attorney Cara Vittore and FBI forensic pathologist Jaquelyn \\"Jake\\" Biscayne.  The other half focuses on solving the case of several related murders along the US/Mexico border.<br /><br />To start with the relationship...  Cara and Jake seem to hate each other to the core in the first few chapters.  Then, miraculously fall into bed together after Cara survives a flash flood.  Let's get real.  Yes, this COULD happen, but with the strong personalities of these women it doesn't seem real.  After that happens, they are inseparable and can't live without each other.  It's taking the U-Haul joke a bit too far and a bit too fast (we're talking Porsche style instead of those slugs U-Haul rents by the hour).  I couldn't get into the romance, and that's why I usually read these books.<br /><br />The FBI case...  This part was more enjoyable and I found myself intrigued.  It had depth and good technical details surrounding the investigation.  Funny thing is... I don't usually like this part of a book, but this was well-written.<br /><br />All in all, this book is good for a lazy afternoon when you're looking for a light read.  It's not something you'll enjoy if you're looking for character or story depth.  It won't be on my bookshelf for long.	2005-09-05

Starting off with a scene reminiscent of the pit scene toward the end of 'Silence of the Lambs,' 'Buried Prejudices' is centered around a potentially intense storyline.  FBI Director Jericho (Rico)Chamaune -- tall, dark, blue eyes-- is investigating the disappearance of several young women around the country.  Shawna(Shawn)MacDonaill -- short, blonde, green eyes-- is one of the latest victims, and the only one to escape.  When Rico first sees Shawn's picture, she feels a strong pull toward the young woman -- this is reinforced when she is called to the hospital to subdue a frantic \\"Jane Doe\\" and recognizes Shawn from her picture.<br /><br />The story is good.  However, the author fails in her research of crime investigation and standard police procedures.  The book would have been much better if the technical details were more factually accurate.  I admit that I'm not in police work, but some things are just common sense.<br /><br />Also, Rico and Shawn fall in love incredibly quickly (like, before they meet) and their families seem unreal (i.e., Rico's mother is WAY too open about sex, Shawn's family seems to take her disappearance/reappearance to easily in stride).  The characters lack the depth seen in quality writing.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you're looking for a light read with few complications (i.e., a mindless romance) and can overlook the technical stuff.  However, if you're looking for something with substance, look somewhere else (i.e., Kallmaker, Radclyffe, Maas, Jones).	2005-09-02

Bri, the young medical examiner, can't get her mind off her libido.  I would be incredibly frightened if the cops in this book reflected the capabilities of those who watch over my little part of the world.

As I read this book, I couldn't help but see things from Gail's point of view.  I am the mother of two pre teen girls.  Let's just say my other half and my kids don't always get along so well... and I'm always stuck in the middle.<br /><br />Calhoun always does a masterful job creating characters who seem real.  However, I think she cheated the reader a little in this regard in 'Outside the Flock'.  When Jo told her husband Mark she was moving out, he rolled over like a puppy, accepted it, and started dating one of HER co-workers.  I know their marriage is not the central theme of the book, but I would expect a man who loved his wife to fight a little more to keep her.  With her frustrations about Gail's daughter, I can certainly understand the attraction Jo feels for Laura.  However, Jo is new to the lesbian \\"thing\\" and her character doesn't seem the type to jump into bed with just anyone.  Jo's sister, Kim, is another anomally.  She has 5 children of her own and seems too wishy-washy to provide a strong shoulder and sound advice for Jo.  I'm concerned about Gail taking Jo back without question after their turmoil too.  Her character seems too mature for blind acceptance.  On top of it all, I'm curious about why Calhoun introduced Jo's estranged father and his lover.  The introduction of these characters was brief and inconsequential to the plot.  The same holds true for the attack on Carol torward the end of the book.  Was Calhoun trying to add bulk?  Connie, Gail's daughter, seems to be the only genuine character in the book.  Calhoun might have considered writing from Connie's point of view to give the book a more realistic twist.<br /><br />Even with the shallowness of most of the characters and seemingly erratic plot lines, I found this book easy and enjoyable to read.  With the introduction of Jo's husband, Jo's lover, Jo's affair, Gail's child, Jo's mother, and Jo's father, the story itself had more depth than many in this genre.  I generally like Calhoun.  This wasn't one of her best, but it is still very good.  Think of it as an enjoyable rainy day time killer...er, the story itself had more depth than many in this genre.  I generally like Calhoun.

She begins to think back on her high school feelings for Quinn, and is surprised to hear her friends think Quinn is a lesbian.  As a whole, her friends and her mother do not approve of Quinn's return and are vocal about that fact.<br /><br />Rachel is scheduled to interview a candidate for the nursery position, and has mixed emotions when she finds Quinn in her office for the interview.

Little does she know...<br /><br />Melissa is more mature and more grounded than Sarah.  She leads a predictible life, but is lonely.  Sarah is a \\"wanna be\\" writer who leeches off anyone she can, and is charming enough to pull it off.  Only after Melissa is drawn into a \\"relationship\\" with Sarah, does she realize she's only really attracted to the sex.  She doesn't know Sarah at all.<br /><br />Sarah's writing talents are recognized by a backer and she receives a grant to work in California.

While both women reestablish themselves in their new home and jobs, Melissa becomes more aware of herself and her true feelings torward Sarah.  Eventually, they both do a little growing up.<br /><br />This book wasn't exactly what I expected after reading the back cover and other Amazon reviews.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

After moving out on her own, Trina began visiting her parents' home on Christmas morning each year.  They treated her horribly every time.  One year, she met her brother's fiancee Rosalie.  Rosalie didn't understand the hatred, contacted Trina to discuss the wedding, and they became fast friends and more.  Rosalie leaves her fiance to be with Trina, but Trina doesn't trust her motives.  All hell breaks loose as a result.  Things get really strange when Trina's brother needs a kidney and she is the best match.<br /><br />The book opens with a hot scene when Rosalie meets Trina in her hotel room.  The story is told through a series of flashbacks.  I normally don't like this approach, but Herring handles it well and keeps it interesting.  The author is masterful at mixing animal attraction with real romance.  These characters are well-developed, deep, and likable.  It's hard to NOT get too involved in this story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  This one will stay on my bookshelf for years to come.	2005-08-08

Lan Harding is a Cherokee woman who seems to live on the outskirts of her community.  When her marina is destroyed by a storm, there are no contractors available to help her rebuild.  If she doesn't rebuild she will lose her business and her life will change completely.<br /><br />In walks Emma Bishop.  Emma's father is one of the contractors who has refused to help Lan.  Emma explains that she needs to prove to her father that she can do this job well so he will sell his business to her instead of a stranger when he retires later in the year.  These women may be each others only hope for a future, so they both stand to win if Lan hires Emma to do the job.<br /><br />As they rebuild the resort called Shared Winds, the women begin to also rebuild parts of themselves.  They find they have much more in common than this project and can't help but fall in love.  Neither will admit her feelings at first, but jealousy, longing, and a near-death accident help them open up.<br /><br />Fantastic first offering by this new author.  This reader is looking forward to her future releases.	2005-07-24

I recently found myself the owner of 'Beware the Kiss' and 'Beware the Serpent' by Alex Acker.  I also recently found myself greatly disappointed with these books.  Although it certainly puts me in the minority, I gave 'Kiss' two stars and read 'Serpent' anyway.  The second book was certainly much better, but...<br /><br />'Serpent' has minor ties to 'Kiss' in the following ways: Raven is still the evil entity; Taylor and Erica make bit appearances; It takes place 1 year after 'Kiss' and is the second part of the three-part curse.  After that, this book could have stood on its own plot line.  The characters lack depth.  Acker never really explains Sterling's \\"powers\\" or Savannah's cancer.  She has Sterling and Leah fall in love with nothing to support their feelings.  She also leaves the reader confused about Wesley - her relationship with Leah and her demise.<br /><br />This book has too many loose ends, too few highlights, and too little character development.  I certainly wasn't sorry to see it end and won't be purchasing Book 3, if it ever gets published.  Do yourself a favor and find something better.	2005-07-24

Jennifer Fulton has very quickly risen near the top of my list of favorite Lesbian authors.  She can easily compete with the likes of L.J. Mass, Radclyffe, and Blayne Cooper.  I am amazed with each new book she publishes.  The Moon Island series is one of the best I've ever read.  Each book is full of fresh material and storylines, and the series refuses to get dull.  Three cheers for this wonderful writter!<br /><br />As usual, the setting is Moon Island -- owned by Annabel, Cody, and their daughter Briar.  No men are allowed on the island due to an ancient curse, the island's most advanced technology is a short wave radio, and the only way to get there is by plane or boat.  Fulton also brings back Chris, a character from Book 3, and introduces a new love interest for this lonely woman.<br /><br />In Book 4, Lauren Douglas, a famous soap star and daughter of a Senator, is outed by her former girlfriend.  Their breakup was immediate after Lauren found her in their shower with a man.  Lauren's father hires Pat Roussel to be her bodyguard.  Pat has recently had her own share of problems with a seemingly unsolvable case and is on long-term leave from the FBI.  Pat's goal is to remain professional and keep Lauren safe, but their hearts get in the way.<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a boat full of men looking for a lost treasure just off the coast of the island.  If you read Book 3, you know why this is a problem (If you haven't, you should!).<br /><br />Do youself a favor -- go grab a Mai Tai, a plate of fresh pineapple, and some shade then sit down and read this book.  It's one you won't soon forget and you'll be craving the next in the series.	2005-07-24

It is about police officer Wendy Lynn Kotter, known as Kotter by her friends.  Kotter is assigned as the primary security officer for Allie de Ville while in town for an off-circuit tennis tournament sponsored by Alie's father.<br /><br />While being teased about her assignment by her commanding officer, Randie, Kotter's thoughts turn to her past.  First, she thinks of losing her virginity to softball player Shamorock.  Then she thinks of her first real \\"love,\\" student teacher and olympic softball player Jaws.  The first 2/3 of the book mainly focuses on these relationships and Kotter's coming into her own.<br /><br />This leads back into the main story of the book... the tennis star.  Kotter seems to have a way with atheletes and Alie is no exception.  While protecting the star, Kotter is also involved in helping solve an attack on Alie's father.  Trying to remain professional drains the cop because she is unquestionably drawn to the athelete, and the reverse is also true.  On top of it all, Alie ALWAYS gets what Alie wants...<br /><br />It's all a tangled web, but this book is very well written and easy to follow.  Recommended, even if you're not a fan of sports, tennis, or mysteries.	2005-07-24

I'm not usually a big fan of science fiction books (movies and TV yes, books no), but this one has captured my attention and I have thoroughly enjoyed these stories.<br /><br />This book has everything - lovers, friends, enemies, athletes, brainiacs, warriors, peacemakers, good, evil, futuristic advancements, and so much more. Whit is scared of Kali's plans to defeat the evil Arianna with her psychic powers.  This is especially true when Arianna \\"flexes her muscle\\" at a community celebration and shakes up the women of Isis.  While everyone is focused on Kali's training routine, no one seems to notice Danu's own training activities.  At one point, everyone is in danger and only a few have the skills to win the battle with evil.<br /><br />Very well written.  This book is light on physical loving, but is heavy on feelings and other expressions of love.  It's impossible not to fall in love with the characters.  I can't wait to read the final two books in the series -- they're on my shelf and calling my name.  Do yourself a favor and meet the inhabitants of Isis.	2005-07-24
US	44596896	R25ZGYW9S5YYU8	1930874022	396284617	Beware the Kiss	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Mediocre at best...	By giving this book a low rating, I realize I'm in the minority.  However, I just can't justify anything higher than 2 stars.  'Beware the Kiss' is the first book in a supposed trilogy, but I don't think the third book has ever been published.<br /><br />In 'Kiss,' journalist Taylor Windquest meets her mother's former lover, Erica Kirsten-Laird.  Erica has lived under a curse set by Raven DeLaire 12 years earlier, and will die on Halloween unless she is saved by a stranger mentioned in the curse.  Taylor soon learns she is to be Erica's savior.<br /><br />The plot is pretty good, but the writing doesn't follow suit.  Except for a few highlights in the story, the characters don't have much depth.  The author makes the reader believe the women are romance-shy for several reasons, but seems to skim over this fact in the text.  Additionally, the final \\"battle\\" between good and evil is flat and disappointing.  The best part of the book was the setting.  The author makes many references to the Twin Cities area where I live.<br /><br />I'm not sure what could have been done to turn this one around, but it's not a book I'll keep on my shelf much longer.  Do yourself a favor and find something else to read.	2005-07-24

Cole loves Jan and wants to make a life with her, but Jan is on a \\"spiritual\\" quest to discover what she really wants from life.  As a result, Cole is left to fend for herself.  While photographing a murder scene one day, Cole meets Tray, the victim's niece.  Cole feels drawn to the flirtatous Tray and becomes intimately involved in her life.  Little does Cole know that Tray is a use-em-and-lose-em kind of gal.<br /><br />Jan, feeling jealous, has Tray investigated and presents the results to the suspicious Cole.  It is what Cole finally does with the information that makes the best part of this story.<br /><br />I think the premise of this book is good and it was worth my time to read.  However, I cannot believe a woman as seemingly cognizant as Cole could be this terribly naive.  At the same time, I know people like Jan and Tray actually exist.  Who knows, maybe the story holds more truth than this reader realizes?<br /><br />This was a real departure from DeYoung's high quality writing style.  I was a little disappointed. Perhaps if I had read this before her other books I would have rated it higher.  Who knows?!	2005-06-30

That doesn't stop it from being a great fantasy!  I thoroughly enjoyed Beers' \\"Thy Neighbor's Wife\\" and hoped \\"Turning the Page\\" would meet he same standards.  I certainly wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />Samantha is a good-for-nothing spoiled brat.  When her bookstore starts to go under, her father asks recently-unemployed cousin Melanie Larson to step in and help out.  When Melanie shows up at Sam's place, she meets the charming Taylor Rhodes and her father Benjamin.  Both of them are determined to win Melanie's heart.  Melanie has never considered a lesbian relationship and goes out with Ben a few times.  However, her thoughts are consistently brought back to Taylor, the woman who has sparked new emotions and feelings Melanie never dreamed possible.<br /><br />This book is consistent with Beers' quality work.  It is well edited and easy to read.  This reader was drawn in to the story and finished the book in one night.  Highly recommended addition to your bookshelf (after you read it a few times, of course).	2005-06-30

Four elderly (60-ish) couples decide to build homes at Paxton Court and retire together there.  All the homes a painted shades of purple and the neighbors have mixed reactions.  I must admit it was a little difficult for me to think about couples in their twilight being sexually active (at least as active as these folks are), but Salvatore does such a nice job keeping things realistic and tasteful this reader forgot how old the characters are.<br /><br />This is truly a great love story -- not only within each couple, but between the eight friends.  As they deal with one especially troublesome neighbor, they make fast friends with several others who know about and overlook their \\"lifestyle.\\"<br /><br />This isn't one I'll keep permanently on my bookshelf, but I'm glad I got the chance to read it.	2005-06-30

Denise is distraught and seeks comfort with Jody because her daughter, Ellen, admits to being a lesbian.  Denise asks the womanizing Jody to help guide Ellen and help her meet people in the hometown to which she has recently returned.  Jody reluctantly agrees, and soon finds Ellen admitting a timeless crush on the woman 19 years her senior.  Denise is not happy for a myriad of reasons and conspires with Ellen's psycho ex-girlfriend to interfere.<br /><br />The second story is about how, even though their lives are filled with contention, the three main characters come together to battle Ellen's very sudden and potentially deadly bout with illness.<br /><br />This was a great story with a three-dimensional supporting cast.  The main characters were well developed and lovable.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars is the age difference between Jody and Ellen -- I just can't relate to that at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended and enjoyable read.	2005-06-30

Sandy and Jenny slowly fall in love and have great college sex.  Sandy is ready and willing to accept herself as a lesbian.  However, Jenny refuses to come out to anyone but Sandy.  When they are older and meet again, Jenny feels differently, but Sandy is scared of being hurt again.  The book is verbose and the story drags.  The print is small and the sentences are long.  Although the premise of the story is good, I would not recommend this book to any of my friends.	2005-06-15

Comedienne Sheila Caston is content with her partner, Julie Rosen.  Julie is very happy with Sheila, but can't understand why Sheila is hesitant to take their relationship to the next level (i.e., move in together and make a family).  When Lynn Webster and her husband of 14 years come to town to offer Sheila a TV contract, Julie is at first excited.  However, she's not aware that Sheila was once very much in love with Lynn -- and maybe still is.  Neither of them is aware that Lynn has finally decided she's ready to admit her love for Sheila as well.  In the end, some win and some lose, but the author keeps the reader guessing until the end.<br /><br />I'm not sure, but I assume the movie came first.  The story behind this book is a good one.  However, the writing seems to assume the reader has seen the move.  Although there are many pictures from the movie scattered throughout the book, they are generally poor quality.  The writing generally does not enable the reader to understand the scene in the nearest picture.<br /><br />I have recently purchased another of Kaplan's books.  I hope it's better than this one.  I'll post that review when I've read it.	2005-06-15

I read Alex Marcoux's first book, 'Facades,' and was less than impressed.  I had already purchased 'Back to Salem,' but because of my experience with 'Facades' it stayed on my bookshelf until a few days ago.  I can't believe I let myself go without the pleasure of reading this book for so long!  Marcoux makes incredible strides toward becoming a remarkable writer in this second book.<br /><br />Jessie Mercer is a successful writer who begins to have very real dreams of a past life as a man.  In her waking hours, she finds herself drawn to straight singer Taylor Andrews, a woman she hasn't even met.  Was Taylor her wife in this previous life?  Jessie's publisher sells the movie rights to one of her books and Taylor is cast in the leading role.  The women become friends as a wild series of events, mirroring those in the movie/book, begins to occur.<br /><br />The author does a wonderful job transitioning between present day and the past, and cleverly reveals Taylor's awareness of her link to Jessie's past.  Other characters in the present and past also come to light.  This is certainly one book I will recommend to my friends.	2005-06-15

I bought this book several months ago and put it on my shelf where it was forgotten.  Imagine my surprise when I finally pulled it down and started to read.  The author presents Macy, a 40-something woman of the world who hasn't had a monogamous relationship in her life.  She's successful and \\"happy\\" in her life.  That holds true until she meets Faith, a gorgeous 20-something, during an attempted mugging.  Through persistance and sincerity Faith breaks through Macy's nonchalant exterior and shows the woman what love really means.<br /><br />I'm not generally into books where the lovers are separated by such a large age difference.  In fact, if the characters are separated by more than 15 years I generally give up and put it down.  However, Michelle Sawyer does such a good job with this story that I forgot there was more than a 20-year difference.<br /><br />This is certainly a book I will read a few more times before passing it on for others to enjoy.	2005-06-03

The majority of the tale is about how no one in their poor family is really happy in their small town or on their farm, so all three kids are making life plans to leave.  About a third of the narrative is actually about Evie and her lesbianism/coming out via a relationship with the local bank owner's daughter.<br /><br />This book is very well written, but I think the author took the lesbian stereotype too far with Evie.  Also, because it is told by her brother, the book doesn't deal too well with Evie's own journey into herself.  If you are a young person with someone close to you who has just come out (to the world or even to just you), this book is a good place to start learning how to provide support.  If you're into your 20's or older, there are far better books available to help you deal with this subject.	2005-06-03

If a book is the least bit interesting it generally takes me about two evenings to get from cover to cover.  This one took me five days.  Every time I sat down to read, I started to fall asleep.<br /><br />The book is about lesbian artist Kate Paine and her high school crush, Ellie Webster.  After their first kiss, the older Ellie left Kate and made her way through life as a successful heterosexual.  The only problem is that Ellie is really a lesbian who won't admit it to herself.  During her marriage, she has lesbian lovers and affairs, but she stays married out of shame of her true nature.  Twenty years after high school the two women find themselves together again.  This time, Kate isn't sure what to think, but she is still very attracted to Ellie.  Ellie divorces her husband and starts a relationship with Kate, but soon leaves Kate for someone else.<br /><br />There is a lot more to it, but I'd be retelling the entire book if I continued.  Suffice it to say that Kate has no self esteem and lets Ellie run all over her.  Ellie is ashamed of her true self and takes advantage of everyone around her. The characters are shallow and the story is disjointed.  This is not a very good book.	2005-05-31

It seemed bizarre that both were the third installment in their respective series. However, considering these were by two of my favorite authors, I should have expected it. (You'll have to see my other reviews to find out what the other book was.)<br /><br />The Moon Island series -- Passion Bay, Saving Grace, and The Sacred Shore -- follows the enduring relationship between a femme, albino American named Annabel and a butch New Zealander named Cody.  They own, live on, and operate a women-only resort on Moon Island.  Each new installment introduces new challenges and new characters who develop relationships, both romantic and plutonic.<br /><br />Sacred Shore tells the story of Merris and Olivia.  Merris has recently divorced her partner due to infidelity.  However, Merris begins to realize she played a large part in the relationship's death.  Olivia has sworn off women after losing the \\"love\\" of her long-time girlfriend, Hunter.  These women have a lot in common, including a mutual friend who helps them \\"see the light.\\"  They finally open up while at Moon Island.<br /><br />The back cover suggests Dr. Glenn Howick and post-grad student Riley Mason are major characters in the book.  However, they are only a small part of the overall storyline.  Glenn has a well-hidden secret and can't let herself fall in love, but it's already too late as Riley has very strong feelings for the doctor.<br /><br />On the other hand, the back cover barely mentions Melanie and doesn't mention Chris at all.  These latter characters are a large part of the story.  Melanie has ALS (Lou Gherig's Disease, terminal) and will die soon.  She also has a very young daughter, conceived via a sperm bank, who needs a family.  Chris finds herself drawn to the straight Melanie, and this helps her deal with the loss of her own long-time partner, Elaine.<br /><br />This book was full of emotional material.

Both the Honor Series and the Justice Series from Radclyffe are great, but the story lines are getting a little stale.  That is not the case with the Provincetown Series (Safe Harbor, Beyond the Breakwater, Distant Shores) at all. The series follows the adventures of deputy sherrif Reese Conlon (picture k.d.lang's face with Lucy Lawless' body; the perfect butch) and her lover Dr. Tori King.<br /><br />In this third book, Radclyffe introduces a complicated plot with intriguing characters:<br />-Tori is recovering from a strenuous pregnancy and hires help in the form of her ex-lover KT, a brilliant surgeon who cheated on Tori and is dealing with a recent hand injury.<br />-Reese has to face jealousy for the first time in her life.<br />-Seeing Tori and Reese together shows KT what she lost.

One weekend, a desperate Ruth runs away with the girl and begins to make a new life far away.  In the meantime, programmer Spencer Rollins runs into trouble at work and is framed for murder.  After a long night of running from the law, Spencer hides and falls asleep in the back seat of a car in a Wal Mart parking lot.  Unfortunately for Ruth, she discovers the sickly, unwanted passenger only after she arrives back at her new home.  The caring Ruth can't bring herself to throw Spencer out and the two develop a tentative friendship as Spencer gets well.  As the women begin to trust each other and disclose their own stories, new feelings begin to develop.  Together they work through their friends, both new and old, to get back on the right side of the law.<br /><br />I truly love KG MacGregor's writing.  She keeps the story exciting and (relatively, it is a fictional romance) realistic.  Her editor also does a wonderful job (typos annoy the heck out of me).  Very highly recommended for a nice, quiet weekend night curled up in front of the fire.  Don't forget the wine and crackers!	2005-05-17

She loves her job and never plans to actually move back home.  One evening after dinner, she takes a walk and sees her high school chemistry lab partner, Justine, from a distance.  Thinking about their passionate school-girl kisses stirs long-buried feelings in Carly.  She longs for that part of her past -- remembering both the tenderness of their friendship with fondness, and the feelings of betrayal she felt when Jessica rejected her because of the attitudes of a small town with melancholy.<br /><br />After high school, Jessica married and had two children.  However, after many years, she was caught by several townfolk kissing and fondling a local doctor's wife in a kitchen during a party.  Following the subsequent divorce, Jessica had a nervous breakdown and almost lost her children.Carly's fear of a second rejection and Jessica's fear of losing her children and scandalizing the town take them down a very rocky road.<br /><br />Will Carly give up her job and dreams of a better life to stay in Leland with Jessica?  Will Jessica be able to get past the opinions of others to follow her heart?  Will Jessica's children forsake her?<br /><br />It's a romance, so you expect them to get together in the end.  However, it isn't until the last few chapters that the author reveals the actual outcome.  Like most books from MacGregor, this one is extremely well written and edited. (She's one of my favorite authors and so I'm biased, but it's still a great book.)  The plot never got boring and kept this reader guessing what would happen next.  Highly recommended, this is one book I'll keep on my shelf for many years to come.	2005-05-17

Tall, raven-haired, blue-eyed Jessica Harrison, an attorney and junior partner at a local law firm, finds she needs help.  She has a reputation for being difficult to work with, so petite, blonde-haired, green-eyed associate Robin Williams is assigned to assist her.  (Are you starting the get the picture?) Both women believe they are straight and each has a difficult past to overcome - Jess was left abruptly by James and Robin's fiance died in a car wreck just after they had a terrible fight.  Despite everything, the two can't deny their feelings and fall quickly into unrequited love.  Neither is willing to admit her feelings until Robin unexpectedly kisses Jess.  They keep their fledgling relationship quiet, but still have consquences to face.<br /><br />This is a very good book and I freely recommend it.	2005-05-17

Many of the books I've read, even those written by seasoned authors, can't hold a candle to this one.  Well-edited and eloquently written, Wings is a phenomenal first book and I can't wait for more.<br /><br />Stacie Gillette is a newspaper reporter who thinks she's the cat's meow. She doesn't take her job seriously because she thinks it's beneath her.  She sleeps with whomever she pleases, but won't let herself fall in love.  She takes her best friend for granted, but doesn't realize it until it's too late.  A series of unfortunate (yet avoidable) events lead to the loss of her job, her best friend, and her self-respect. Befriended by Cheryl Wright (an author who had denied Stacie an interview) and Estelle Vargas (editor of a local free paper),  Stacie begins to understand she's not the center of the universe.<br /><br />At 263 pages, this book is a real bargain.  Even with its length, I finished it in one night (last night) and it stuck with me all day today.  These characters have depth, they have personalities, and they deal with real-life issues.  The author did a masterful job keeping this reader in suspense -- I couldn't tell until about 2/3 through who would finally capture Stacie's heart.  I couldn't piece together the ending until I was almost there.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the quality of this author's work.  Three cheers for a tremendous new addition to the world of lesbian fiction!	2005-05-16

Hot, hot, hot sex scenes; totally unbelievable story; great characters with depth... and so much more.<br /><br />It IS a stretch to think a lesbian has two daughters who both turn out to be lesbians - one is thoughtful and righteous, the other is selfish and a player.  It IS NOT a stretch that both daughters would be in love with the same woman. It IS a stretch that that woman would fall in love with both sisters (not at the same time of course... that would be too much!).  It IS NOT a stretch that hot sex like this DOES happen (okay, maybe it IS, but it's a book!).<br /><br />Great for an afternoon lounging around with a glass of wine and a plate of cheese and crackers.

I have read a lot of their fan fiction and would give most of it 6 stars on a 5 star scale.  I was anxious to read Castaway when it appeared in my mailbox, so I grabbed a beer, curled up in my favorite chair and began to read.  I was almost immediately disappointed.<br /><br />I realize this book is a spoof on Survivor.  I also admit I have never been a fan of the show.  However, I expected more from these gals. Maybe it's been too long since Survivor's debut year and the novelty has worn off.  I don't know.<br /><br />I did enjoy the humor and wit, but the basic story was anemic.  Fun for an afternoon, but this one didn't stick with me.	2005-05-10

She's not scared to push the envelope and rarely has \\"tops\\" or \\"bottoms\\" in her writing (i.e., both women take charge at some point).  She is also very good at interspersing these scenes throughout the book and not just dumping them into the last 20 pages or so.  If you like stories like that, buy this book.  If you don't, try Lori Lake, Saxon Bennett, or one of the other great lesbian fiction writers out there.<br /><br />On the other hand, the story in this particular book was a little too far fetched... even for this genre.  Dorian falls for someone who is emotionally unavailable, turns the head of a straight woman, and finds herself in a crazy situation.  This doesn't even take into account her history with Gina... a married ex-lover who shows up at an extremely awkward time.<br /><br />I spent an enjoyable afternoon reading this book on my deck.  However, it's not the kind of story I'll think back on for the next few days.  The characters were three-dimensional, but they weren't memorable.  The book was better than three stars, but not quite four stars.  Buy it, read it, and pass it on.	2005-05-10

A friend convinces Becca to take advantage of nontransferrable tickets she won for a lesbians-only cruise.  The only problem is Becca takes a day trip at one of their stops and misses the boat that evening.  She enters an odd bookstore to find something to read and runs across an old box full of odds and ends.  In the box is a journal maintained by Lindsay West, outlining her time with the late Rob, her beautiful lover Mercedes, and a cast of other characters.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed the story in the journal, but the Becca story detracted from the overall book and could have been omitted.  The characters were three dimensional and memorable.  Although the cover suggests a sequel, I wouldn't have been interested in it because the story ended at the right place.  I don't think the sequel was ever published anyway (this book was published in 1995 and I can't find anything else by Rios).<br /><br />This book was not what I expected, but I enjoyed it anyway.

I readily agree with most of the other Amazon reviewers of this book -- the plot is not original and the reader knows what will happen on the next page.  However, this book has something special that makes it very different than others in this genre -- the author.  This is the first Georgia Beers book I've read and I'm delighted to say I have 'Turning the Page' on my 'to read' bookshelf.  Her writing is fantastic.  Beers gives life to her characters and scenes, making the reader feel like an eavesdropper.<br /><br />Alex lives in a cabin given to her by an aunt.  She's a former schoolteacher who is trying to write a novel.  One afternoon her dog gets loose and, as a result, she meets her new neighbor Jennifer.  Jennifer is married to a man she's known most of her life.  They come from wealthy families that have high expectations of them both.  Alex has given up on love.  Jennifer, who went through a lesbian \\"phase\\" in college, finds herself undeniably attracted to Alex.  Both women respect Jennifer's marriage vows, making both of them even more unhappy.  However, the most unlikely of people (Jennifer's husband)puts things into perspective for all of them.<br /><br />I could not put this one down.  Forget the recipe, it's the author that makes this one special.  She has a gift and I hope she keeps turning out the books for a very long time.	2005-04-24

I hate to start in the middle of a story line, so I bought the other two before getting started.  Book 1 (Love on the Line) was a little disappointing.  Book 3 (Love Speakes Her Name) wasn't much better.  However, this second book was fantastic.  The best part is this series doesn't have to be read in order to get the most out of it.  In fact, except for the main character and supporting cast, the books could be read independently without the reader \\"missing\\" anything important.  Enough about the series flow...<br /><br />I fell into this book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Kay Westmore, US Park Service in Alaska, has just parted ways with her much younger girlfriend and is sent on a mission to investigate oil refining companies in Barrow.  Barrow is home to the Inuit people, including one intriguing lawyer named Lela Newlin.  Kay isn't looking for a relationship, but this one falls so delicately into her lap that she can't ignore or deny her feelings for Lela.<br /><br />Of course in the end they save the day and solve the mystery, but when it's all over will they be able to survive a long-distance relationship?  Only time will tell.<br /><br />Great read.  One of Young's best.	2005-04-22

Kay Westmore is called on by her former boss, Grace Perry, to go on a covert mission to uncover an illegal plutonium mining operation.  Kay goes on the mission with her trusted colleague Russ, but they also have to work with CIA agent Tory Mitchell.  The worst part is Kay has to lie about the mission to Lela, her lover of two years, and leave while her best friend is suffering through chemo for breast cancer.  There are no phones where they're going.<br /><br />Young delivers a quality story by intertwining the details of the mission with the reluctant romance between Kay and Tory.  She also gets Russ involved in helping Kay deal with her guilt for cheating on Lela.  Instead of being angry with Kay for her indiscretion, this reader felt only sorrow for how things finally ended between the three women.<br /><br />I've read most of Young's books.  This is one of her best.	2005-04-22

I was reluctant to purchase this one because I had already been disappointed by two other Forrest books ('Amateur City' and 'Dreams and Swords').  However, my curiosity got the best of me and I'm glad it did.<br /><br />I won't go into the details of the story because you can get that from the 45 other reviews already here.  The bottom line is two women fall in love in the midst of bigotry and small-mindedness.  Their love is emotional and the sex is hot.  To say more would not do justice to Forrest's accomplishment.<br /><br />I'm keeping this one (well, I might let my partner read it if she's nice to me).  You'll have to find your own copy to read.	2005-04-22

Some of the other reviewers suggest this story is a little far fetched.  I might be inclined to agree, but it's a fictional romance and I don't mind -- they're supposed to be like that.  Jackie lives in a decrepit house she wants to sell, can't keep a girlfriend, and loves her demanding job.  After a party at her home, she meets a woman (D.J.) who falls for her best friend (Carla) and agrees to fix up the house in exchange for a place to stay.  One of D.J.'s friends (Valerie) is hired at Jackie's office to help out.  Val lets Jackie know she's interested, but Jackie doesn't date coworkers (or anyone for that matter).  Valerie's only choice is to quit the job so Jackie doesn't have any excuses.  Jackie reluctantly agrees to a date and that starts things moving in the right direction.<br /><br />After Jackie admits she's fallen in love, she discovers Valerie has a husband.  What a shock to her heart! It seems she's surrounded by lies and deception, but Valerie won't let her get away.<br /><br />This storyline is original, enjoyable, and intense.  The relationship is complicated (aren't they all...) and the sex is hot.  It certainly follows the storyteller's golden rule (every story must have a happy ending) and keeps the reader's attention.  Highly recommended for those who want a pleasant and tantalizaing momentary escape from reality.	2005-04-22

I like to mix up my reading list periodically by throwing in a non-fiction book from my usual genre (lesbian literature).  With \\"Heart's Progress\\" I'm glad I did.  This book tells the story of many of us who got married before we figured out who we really were (or had the courage to admit it).  In sharing her life with the reader, Bepko does an outstanding job of relaying the feelings and complications associated with coming out in an unforgiving society.<br /><br />The book invoked feelings of sadness, frustration, deep-rooted love, absolute anger, fear, and many others.  I laughed, I cried, I was both sad and happy to see it end.  If you or a friend are having issues related to coming out (or trying to define yourself), this book is for you.	2005-04-11

In fact, I bought it because I already owned the sequel (Forever and the Night) and I hate to start in the middle of a storyline.  I must say, I was a little disappointed by this one and hope the sequel is better.<br /><br />The book started with Kay Westmore, a late 30-something US National Park Service Ranger in Alaska, dealing with a bad breakup and a fledgling relationship with Stef, an early 20-something college co-ed.  It seems Kay's estranged ex was stalking and threatening her, and that the co-ed was ready to start a relationship while Kay was not.  This was the first few chapters.<br /><br />The next chapters (i.e., most of the book) were about Kay's assignment to provide a tour of the Alaskan pipeline to Grace Perry, an ambitious goverment official.  Unbeknownst to Kay, Grace is investigating the malicious tampering of the pipeline.  Grace is difficult, demanding, and obnoxious, but Kay stays true to herself and keeps Grace safe during an extreme snowstorm and cold spell.<br /><br />The romance was only a very minor portion of this book.  From this reader's viewpoint, this was merely a mystery book with a lesbian as a main character.  Even after reading the back cover, I wasn't prepared for that.  I'm hoping the sequel will focus more on the relationship between Kay and Stef, and will be more in line with Young's other published titles.	2005-04-10

I am often amazed at how well some authors relay the erotic side of a love story.  Kallmaker certainly doesn't disappoint with this one.  In fact, it's one of the best Kallmaker books I've read yet.  Brandy works at a resort.  One of her co-workers is her very close, straight friend Tess.  Even though Tess is straight, she relieves sexual tension through periodic encounters with Brandy.<br /><br />One of Brandy's idols, Celine, comes to the resort, followed by a group of vacationing lesbians.  Brandy finds herself in heaven and goes to bed with Celine on the first night.  In front of Brandy's surprised eyes, Tess also finds a warm body to share her bed.  Even while in bed with Celine, Brandy can't help but think about Tess.  These feelings confuse her (are they love, jealousy, what?) and she doesn't know what to do. Little does she know that Tess is having difficulties of her own.<br /><br />There is a fine love story here even without the erotica, but who am I to complain?	2005-04-10

Del saves the day.<br /><br />It's a little difficult to get your mind around the varied characters and their intertwined relationships, so I suggest you read this one when you can concentrate on it fully.

(The back cover was wrong to mention Alex and Taylor because they don't make an appearance.) It was hard to get to know the characters in the first book, but the effort was worth it and made book 2 much better.  Gigi is back dealing with her tenuous relationship with Caroline by participating in therapy with Dr. Kohlrabi.  Caroline is still in love and living with Gigi.  Gigi and Mallory learn how to be friends, and Del learns to accept that friendship.<br /><br />Dr. Helen Kohlrabi has a much bigger part in this sequel.  Her \\"straight,\\" engaged, lawyer daughter falls in love with a female associate - Rafferty.  Rafferty's mother, Bel, finds out, meets Helen, and those two women also fall in love.  Like mother, like daughter.  In the meantime, Gigi is writing a book for God.  I'm still not sure why the author chose that device (i.e., bringing in a female version of God to interact with some of the characters) for the story.  It seemed a little out of place, but didn't detract from the quality of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I was happy to have spent a few hours of my down time to enjoy this book.	2005-04-10

From the first page of 'Return to Isis' I was hooked.  Freeland is a mixture of all races, but mainly homosexuals, women in particular.  They live by the good ole US Constitution, have protogenesis (in this case, reproduction without sperm), and a cure for a mutated form of AIDS called AGH.  Elysia is what is left of the white, Christian, heterosexual society of America.  The region is dominated by men, women are kept as breeders or drones, and they are over-run by AGH.<br /><br />Whit is a warrior from Freeland who is doing an undercover operation in Elysia.  When trying to return home, she accidentally saves Amelia from from her horrible life in Elysia.  This book is about their struggle to gain acceptance for Amelia and about Amelia regaining lost memories. It is well-written and edited, and kept this reader's attention.  Although the setting is in the future, the science fiction theme only enhanced the story.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the time to read this story and am looking forward to the remaining four books in the series.	2005-03-25

Better late than never!  I thought the first book in the series, 'Return to Isis,' was good, but this one is much better.  Whit and Kali have convinced the council to let them rebuild Isis.  As they start to make this happen, the council appoints three new leaders to ensure their success.  Tensions (sexual, power struggles, revenge) build throughout the book until the dam breaks, but I won't hint to the conclusion.<br /><br />If you like science fiction and lesbians, you'll like this book.  If you don't care for science fiction, you'll still like it.  The SF isn't overly done, it just provides a setting for the story.  Highly recommended.  I'm looking forward to reading the third book, 'Warriors of Isis,' this weekend.	2005-03-25

Jamie is a young-but-marvelous chef who is tired of killing herself to make her ungrateful boss successful.  After receiving an inheritance from her Aunt Emily, she decides to buy Emily's old restaurant and give it a go on her own.  Little does she realize her new dream comes complete with inspectors, fines, back taxes, and other various problems.<br /><br />Almost by accident, Jamie meets Val - a woman with problems of her own.  It seems Val has convinced the readers and owners of a magazine she writes for that she is a young version of Martha Stewart.  She wants to take home improvement to the TV, but doesn't have a single project to call her own.  Even worse, she can't cook (not even Cheerios).<br /><br />Jamie, who has only ever loved one woman, reluctantly agrees to teach Val, who seemingly sleeps with anything that walks,  cooking basics in exchange for Val's remodeling/redecorating expertise.  The pair find themselves increasingly unable to dismiss growing feelings for each other.  Jamie's defense is to make every decadent chocolate treat known to the world.  Val's is to throw herself into the project with everything she has.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the antics, deception, and tension between Jamie and Val.  Kallmaker certainly doesn't disappoint with this one.  Although there are three different \\"narrators,\\" it is well written and easy to follow.

The publisher has introduced an English translation of Gogol's European best seller.  Due to the excellent editing, if I hadn't read the cover I would never have known it was a translation.<br /><br />The story is narrated by a seemingly-uptight woman who works as a project manager and accidentally picks up a high-priced hooker.  The hooker finds the situation charming and provides her first night's services free of charge.  This starts a complex journey for both women as the project manager struggles to reconcile her feelings for the hooker with the other woman's profession.  At the same time, the hooker carries a lot of old baggage and is scared by what she feels for the narrator.  The only place they can be themselves is in Paris.<br /><br />I can't explain how good this book is.  You'll just have to take my word for it.

She does a fantastic job developing characters and story lines, keeping the reader completely engaged.  The only problem (if you can call it that) is many of her books are long, so don't start reading until you can check out of your regular life for a few days.<br /><br />In 'The Last Train Home,' Cooper delivers a touching story of two young wome from very different worlds who become fast friends and first lovers.  Lindsay has grown up on the street and leads a rough, day-to-day existance.  Ginny has an education, but works long hours in a chicken-plucking factory to help support her poor family.  Ginny's apartment building falls victim to a fire, her parents and some siblings are killed, and while she is in the hospital, her three youngest siblings are adoped out by a crooked orphanage.  The story follows Ginny and Lindsay as they fight to survive, search for the kids and fall in love.<br /><br />Very nicely done.

Jenny KNOWS she wants Susan.  This is a well-written book about falling in love with oneself and developing a sense of self-understanding.  It was easy to cry for Jenny, get angry at Susan, and maintain hope for a happy ending.  The best part of the book is Schiano's ability to keep the reader guessing.  Unlike with many books in this genre, you can't guess how the story will finally end.	2005-03-18

Jody is a seemingly atypical country star (i.e., she doesn't sleep with just any adoring fan) with an interesting band.  Her bus breaks down in the middle of the Australian Outback and they find themselves stuck at a small truck stop for a few days.  Grace, the owners' daughter, is a 28-year-old divorced virgin who immediately has unfamiliar feelings for the singer.  After a little time and soul-searching on both women's parts, they find happiness with each other.<br /><br />This is a lovely book with which you will not be disappointed.  It is well-written, thoughtful, and believable.  I'm only sorry I waited until 8 years after it was published to discover it!	2005-03-10

This was a good story, but parts of the book seemed like a broken record (i.e., \\"they just did that\\").  The characters, although misunderstood by everyone around them, are likable and smart.  However, they are mostly untrusting and cannot make committments (to themselves or to others).  The book's format keeps the reader interested, but the overall story is depressing.  Except for the excessive slang, the language is moderate and the sex is relatively non-descript.<br /><br />To get the most from this story the reader should be melancholy, as it will likely bring down a good mood and reinforce a poor mood.	2005-03-10

This is a wonderful third installment in Lake's Gun series.  It was easy to fall in love with Dez and Jay in the first two books, and that is only enhanced by their fears for each other in number three.  Hoping to enjoy a leisurely vacation, they go camping with friends.  Their fun is interrupted by escaped convicts, Russians, bad weather, and near misses.  The majority of the book takes place over about 24 hours and this reader's legs had sympathy pains for Dez as she ran non-stop to find Jay.<br /><br />Typical of Lake's other books, this one was very well written and drew me in.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars insead of 5 is I prefer books that lean more on the romance than the action.  If you like action, this book's for you.  If you prefer romance, you'll probably like the first two books much better.	2005-03-10

In this book, American Grace Ramsey (a former lover of Annabelle and player of the field) is doing covert research about Moon Island for her company.  This company is desperate to buy the land and will stop at nothing to make that happen.  Also on the island is homophobic and seemingly-straight Australian Dawn Beaumont.  Dawn is taking a respite from her world that was shattered when she caused a tragic auto accident.<br /><br />Thirty-something Grace wagers with herself about getting Dawn into bed quickly.  Dawn, 22, wrestles with new and confusing feelings.  They both do a lot of growing up.<br /><br />Fulton mixes romance in with a little drama and mystery.  The reader can't help but fall for the charismatic characters, and feel their pain and confusion.  This reader even yelled at the book (\\"kiss the girl, already\\") much like some movie-goers in tense scenes.<br /><br />Highly recommended for an enjoyable summer evening at home on the deck with pina coladas and pretzels.	2005-03-08

Little does she know the love of her life, a woman no less, is waiting there for her.  That woman is L.C. Hackett, a rock star who hasn't won a grammy in several years and is trying to get back on top.  This reader enjoyed the story, but won't spend the time to read it again.  The romance was great and most of us would love to have a relationship like theirs, but nothing really happened in the book.  Sure, there were angst and issues surrounding making two lives one, but the story was bland and unexciting.  It almost seemed like a \\"day in the life\\" of these two women instead of an exciting new relationship.<br /><br />Recommended for when you're in a melancholy mood and don't have anything better to do... accompanied with a cold beer and a bag of chips.  This one only takes a few hours from start to finish.	2005-02-23

Peters does a wonderful job in capturing the issues surrounding coming out for young people, and deals with them courageously and realistically.  She delivers a story of one girl who is supported by her parents and another who is disowned. One girl who is openly and comfortably gay, and another who is closeted and dealing with her newly-realized sexuality.  These girls find comfort in each other as they deal with internal and external forces.  If a book like this had been available 20 years ago, I might have made different choices in my own life. I might even have my own pre-teen daughters read it.<br /><br />The book is well-written, thoughtful, and easy to read.  I haven't read a story this good in a very long time.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone of any age who is dealing with issues of sexuality... accompanied with a Coke and a bowl of Bing cherries...<br /><br />Did I mention I really liked this book?	2005-02-23

His sister, Carly, is scheduled for a visit the next day.  Nic searches for Jimmy's attacker, while tentatively falling for Carly.  Carly worryies about Nic and explores her new feelings as well.<br /><br />The idea of this story is good.  However, the book has several trite moments.  For instance, three days after meeting Nic, Carly confesses her love.  Jimmy is shot, but recovers in the hospital only to be attacked there.  Nic, not hospital staff who have access to monitors and machines, finds him in cardiac arrest.  He comes through this one as well.  The criminals seemed dumb, making it too easy for Nic to get answers to her questions.<br /><br />This book has some well-placed four-letter words.  And, except for the sketchy remnants of several dreams, there are no sex scenes.<br /><br />I agree with Lori Lake in that I'm looking forward to the sequel and hope this promising author will show overall improvement in the next book.  Recommended for reading in bed with a flashlight, accompanied with a pot of your favorite decaf.	2005-02-09

The story is well-written and parts of it are very funny. However, at almost 350 pages, the book itself is long winded and boring.

Baylor Warren's elderly aunt is hospitalized with a broken hip and asks her to take care of her home on Ana Lia Island in south Florida.  The island and people are very different from what Baylor is used to in Chicago.  Soon after arriving on the island, Baylor has an accident of her own when local vet Hobie Lynn Allen runs her over with her truck.  At first hostile torward each other, the women find themselves falling in love.  Both are scared of their feelings, but are influenced by outside forces (island residents, Hobie's son, and Baylor's friend) to move forward.<br /><br />I have liked everything I've read by Maas and this is no exception.  This book was well-written and thoughtful, with a little suspense thrown in to boot.  Additionally, I love finding a lesbian romance that isn't pure template.  This story allowed the relationship to develop before they fell into bed, and the sex scenes were more sensual than pornographic.  I think it takes real talent to pull that off. To top it off, the story was believable, even with the strange behaviors of the island residents (I grew up in Florida... must be all that sun that drives people cooky!).<br /><br />Strongly suggested for those who love a good story and would rather leave the porn to someone else.  Recommended for a lazy day, perhaps with a bubble bath, accompanied with a carafe of pinot grigio and cheese with crackers.	2005-02-03

Dray is a firefighter with a disturbed past, but a stable present.  Abby is struggling to survive, not quite homeless, but close.  They meet, they feel an immediate attraction, they struggle with the attraction, then they give in to it.  Simple, common, formula... On the plus side, the author seemed to accurately portray the life of a firefighter and medical care for severe burns.  Her writing is not trite, nor is it difficult to follow.  This was okay for a first book, but is far from a winner.<br /><br />The basic plot was interrupted by flashbacks of a previous life (circa WWII) that added nothing to the story.  Once the characters gave in to their feelings, the book should have ended.  However, it dragged on for another 100 pages or so.  As for editing, there were several obvious errors - these tend to be very distracting for me.<br /><br />Recommended for a long flight or somewhere you expect to do a lot of waiting around, accompanied with a cold soft drink and a bag of pretzels.	2005-01-26

Over time she regained a loving friendship, but the romance was forever lost and Rae lives a life of random trysts. Evon Lagrace fell deeply in love while at school in England.  Her lover was killed in a horrible accident and she doesn't want another love.  These women meet under odd circumstances and feel an immediate attraction.  However, because of their past experiences, neither is anxious to explore her new feelings.<br /><br />This book was well written and kept me fully engaged.  A little foul language, a few racy scenes, and a lot of strong feelings contribute to a fantastic story.  Barry gives her characters depth and background, a characteristic missing in many romances.  I give her a thumbs up and hope she continues her efforts as a writer.<br /><br />Recommended for a lazy evening in front of a fire, accompanied with a carafe of good red wine and a block of fine cheese.

When I first got my hands on this book I wasn't sure if I'd like it, so I put it on my bookshelf.  One day, bored with the norm, I picked it up, started reading, and couldn't put it down.  Martinac does a wonderful job hiding a relationship in \\"transition\\" within a touching story about lesbians from the past.  It's hard for many people to believe, but we've been around since the dawn of time.<br /><br />I found it easy to get wrapped up in Susan's search for answers about \\"The Gang\\" while ghosts of Harriet and Lucy help Susan in her quest.  This was not a typical lesbian romance, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all the same.<br /><br />Recommended for a rainy day, accompained with a cup of hot tea and lemon cookies.	2005-01-21

For starters, the doctor wants to jump her patient's bones the second she's brought into the ER.  This is unethical to say the least.  That same doctor goes through a pregnancy and a horrible auto accident, and doesn't seem to understand any of the medical lingo.  The firefighter has an almost psychotic aversion to relationships, but asks the doctor to move in on their second date.  That's taking the U-Haul joke a bit too far.<br /><br />On top of the pathetic excuse for a story, the editor of this book should find a new job.  On page 23, I started flagging the gross errors with Post-it flags.  After 19 flags, I stopped on page 101 when I ran out.  These errors were very distracting.  Examples?  Using \\"buy\\" instead of \\"by\\" in the sentence \\"I'll come BUY later.\\"  \\"Make YOUR SELVES comfortable.\\" (yourselves is one word!)  \\"She NEW what was meant to come.\\"  (this form of \\"new\\" is spelled with a K!)  The book is also riddled with punctuation errors and omissions (ex., missing quotation marks, missing commas, etc.)  This was all incredibly distracting.  I expect this in a beta-version book, but it's unacceptable in a published version.  Shame on the editors.<br /><br />I noticed the book is now out of print.  This is a good thing.  Recommended for a 5th grade English class to use for editing exercises, accompanied with a glass of cold milk and a bag of oreos.	2005-01-17

This book has a similar premise, except it has much more drama and much less comedy.  Bree Starling, a gifted violinist whose talent has been groomed from a young age, loses her parents and moves in with her mother's childhood friend, Lani.  Lani's daughter, Jorie, isn't happy about having to share her life with Bree, and she makes sure everyone knows it.  But, there is an underlying passion between the two girls that only Bree is willing to openly admit.  After several tries to win Jorie's heart, Bree gives up and embraces a risky lifestyle.  After her career is cut short by carpal tunnel syndrome, Bree finds herself facing Jorie again.<br /><br />This is not a light read.  The book is structured as flashbacks to Bree's life as she processes her feelings about facing Jorie once again after Lani dies.  I was so taken with this book that I took it to work, closed my office door, and read until my eyes hurt.  Kallmaker certainly doesn't disappoint with this one.	2005-01-17

With her parents' blessing she locates and arranges to meet Maggie Easton, the woman who gave her up 25 years prior.  Maggie, the unfortunate victim of teenage love, has dreamed of the reunion, but has never told her current husband or family about the baby.  She asks Riley to hang about and do odd jobs until she tells her husband, but he is on an extended business trip.  While she waits, Riley makes friends with Maggie's son Jake and becomes enamored with Maggie's complicated, straight step-daughter, Jayne.<br /><br />This story is told totally from Riley's point of view.  The reader experiences her fears about telling Maggie she's a lesbian and dealing with her growing feelings for Jayne. Jayne deals with some complicated feelings of her own, but the reader isn't privy to her thought process.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a comfortable read that didn't require too much deep thinking.  Recommended for a lazy afternoon accompanied with a cold beer (or two).	2005-01-17

This is my first read of Diana Tremain Braund, and I'm now looking forward to reading her other books.  I started this one Friday night and finished on Saturday afternoon.  The story is set in Maine lobster country.  Molly Bean, an orphan who was raised with her younger brother by a family friend, Auntie Em, operates a lobster boat.  Her brother, younger by about 10 years and a virtual stranger to Molly, gets arrested for drug possession.  There has also been a murder at the local university and Molly's ex-girlfriend is back in town.  It's bad enough Molly has to deal with all of this, when along comes attorney Carolyn Stanley.  Their first encounter is messy, but the two feel an immediate attraction.  Molly finds herself behaving badly toward Carolyn, and Carolyn isn't sure pursuing a relationship is worth the headache.  Matchmakers Allan (Carolyn's friend) and Charlie (Molly's friend), a couple for five years, get involved to ensure their good friends don't give up too soon.<br /><br />This was a really nice book.  There were a lot of characters to keep track of, but they all contributed to the story line.  I'm not sure there was the perfect balance between the drugs/homicide issue and the romance, but it didn't seem to drag the story down too much.  Carolyn could have had any profession because her being a lawyer didn't impact the plot at all - it just seemed like an afterthought.<br /><br />Overall good read.  Recommended for a cold winter day accompanied with a hot pot of coffee. (That's half the year in Minnesota, and probably in Maine too!)	2005-01-17

However, I felt a little let down by this story.  The premise is that Maxine and Betina have been together for 5 years.  They are exhibitionists and have mind-blowing sex in all kinds of strange places.  One day Maxine comes home to realize her house is uncharacteristically messy (dirty dishes from the night before, extra laundry lying about, etc.), her power has been shut off, and her lover can't stop crying.  Suddenly realizing her lover is clinically depressed, Maxine spends the majority of the book trying to get Betina to see a doctor, while she maintains her own ob-gyn practice and demanding patients.  (I think Maxine performed more hysterectomies in the book than are performed annually in the US!)<br /><br />I liked the characters and the idea of the story, but the delivery was choppy. The author took many liberties with the medical profession in general, but especially with regard to the treatment of Betina's depression (like a switch she was depressed, then she wasn't).  Additionally, the end was abrupt and distracting.  This wasn't a terrible book, but it was disappointing.	2005-01-12

As a pleasant surprise,however, in this one 95% of the emphasis is on Maggie and Celia.

Everyone suspects she's a lesbian because she \\"looks like one.\\"  Truth be told, she's not sure herself because she's never been anything... no relationships, no attractions, just the Marines.  Reese meets Dr. Tory King, the only doctor in town, while investigating a break-in a the local clinic.  There is an immediate attraction.

Bennett does not necessarily follow the standard recipe for lesbian romance novels.  This one opens with two stories about four women.  The plot then twists, turns, and finally converges into one story line.  All the characters achieve some semblance of personal growth.  Some live happily ever after, others don't.<br /><br />This book has a lot of sex, a moderate amount of foul language, and is very well written.

Meg Rhyland discovers she might have a half-brother who is entitled to half of her inheritance.  She investigates to determine if his story is true.  This is where the good stops and the disappointing begins due to erratic plot lines.<br /><br />For instance, Meg is investigating this man on her own then suddenly meets with private investigator, Susan, at a restaurant.  Although the back cover talks about a PI, her abrupt appearance is confusing.  What helped Meg decide to hire her?  What is her background?  How did she find her?<br /><br />Another disconnect is Meg's relationship with her lover Kit.  Is Kit straight or gay?  What does Kit's sister have to do with the story?  What is the point of Kit's alcoholism?  How does this add to the main story line?  If Meg is truly devoted to Kit, why does she turn to Susan?<br /><br />This is a well-written book, but the asides are distracting.  Young missed a true opportunity here.	2004-12-28

Two decaf pots later, I finished this wonderful book about a lesbian who falls in love with a \\"straight\\" co-worker.  Leslie Howard is afraid of breaking the cardinal rule (Never get involved with a straight woman), and fights the undeniable attraction she feels toward Sara Stevens.  Sara sends mixed signals, especially when she finds out Leslie is gay.<br /><br />This book is well-written.  Yes, there is profanity, but it is used appropriately.  I fell in love with the characters.  It was hard not to cry for Leslie, get angry with Sara, or empathize with their friends and co-workers.  I was sad to see it end.	2004-12-27

Crystal Sheridan is the victim of child abuse - actively by her physically abusive father and passively by her alcoholic mother.  Running away from home at the vulnerable age of 15, she gets involved in the world of sex, stripping, drugs and alcohol to survive.  After her apartment burns down, she is forced to find a new home.<br /><br />Laura Taylor is a single, neat-nic lesbian with a miserable romantic history who is currently in need of a roommate to help with expenses.  Her realtor friend (and resident matchmaker) rents her spare room to Crystal.<br /><br />Opposites in almost every way, Crystal and Laura learn to understand each other and help each other start to heal with the help of Jenny, Laura's ex and a psychiatrist who specializes in abuse cases.<br /><br />As with most by B.L.Miller and Verda Foster, solo or as a team, this is a very good book.  It is thought-provoking, well-written, and hard to put down.	2004-12-27

Amy's daughter hates her, her twins aren't sure how to feel, and her husband takes it in stride.  Deb feels slighted and seeks comfort with another woman.  Amy finds a friend of her own.  In my experience, it just doesn't happen that way.  Kids being confused, I understand, but most husbands don't just roll over when their wife leaves for another woman.<br /><br />I applaud Calhoun's attempt at a different approach in this story, but it was a little unbeliveable.  Other books of her's I've read have been a much better use of my time.	2004-12-20

It was written in a more intellectual tone than your typical romance.  I found it a little difficult to get hooked on the story, but my patience paid off and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Highly recommended if you're looking for an atypical lesbian romance.	2004-12-20
US	44596896	R2LQQJEX7ATWX0	1932300074	912828097	Twist of Fate	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Rare Beauty	I started reading this book last night and couldn't put it down until the wee hours this morning after I read the last page.  After falling in love with Madison Williams, Lauren Taylor finally admits to herself she's gay.  There's only one catch... Lauren is married to a US Senator who is planning to run for President.  Torn between doing what's right for herself and what's right for others, Lauren makes herself, her husband, and Madison miserable for years before she decides what to do.<br /><br />I could easily relate to characters on both sides of this equation.  Superb book.  Very highly recommended.  I don't rate many books as 5 stars, but would have given this one 6 if that had been an option.	2004-12-20

The classic recipe for success is two women from different backgrounds finding each other under difficult circumstances.  That's what you'll find in this book.  On top of that, you'll find steamy scenes, insecurity, fear of trust, and a sense of familiarity.  This book was much more enjoyable than \\"Greener Than Grass\\" and I read it in one night.	2004-12-07

The two main characters are from very different backgrounds, but find balance in each other.  Sonny, the intelligent younger sister of the manager of the band Warlord, realizes she is a lesbian as she falls in love with Torrin.  Torrin, who comes from a world of sexual and drug abuse, uses and disposes of women like toilet paper.  Sonny must convince Torrin she deserves to be loved.<br /><br />Do not read this book if you are sensitive to the darker side of society.  However, if you enjoy a serious read this book is fabulous.	2004-12-05

Cassie is 19 and Blair is 38.  Add four years and we're talking the age difference between my oldest daughter and me.  If Fulton had kept the age span closer to 10-12 years or so, I would have have rated it much higher.	2004-12-03

This gift allowed her to move up from an underpriviledged to a wealthy lifestyle.  However, she's overstressed, her girlfriend is cheating, and she's miserable.  After her health takes a turn for the worse, she listens to her doctor and takes a leave of absence from her company.  Meaning to relax, she finds herself washing dishes for Cory.<br /><br />This book made me laugh - a lot.  I could relate to the characters on a personal level.  They took things slow and let the passion build.  Even the plot twist at the end was welcomed.  Recommended for a rainy afternoon because it's hard to put down.	2004-12-03

My children were running through the house and the dog was barking, but I was so engrossed in this story I didn't notice a thing.  This was my first Martin read and I can't wait to read her others.<br /><br />Connie is a strong woman who appears mousey, but comes into her own and blossoms after meeting Kasey.  Kasey appears strong, but her weaknesses surface after meeting Connie.  They feel an immediate attraction, but take some time to consider the consequences of a relationship.  To make matters worse, Kasey's friends are convinced Connie is straight, but Connie is determined to prove her love.  These two women balance each other.<br /><br />Great story, well written and believable.  However, there was a little more male-bashing than necessary.  Hey, they don't ring my bell, but they're not all bad.  I  give this one an enthusiastic 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who believes in love.	2004-11-29

I couldn't put it down and read the entire story in one evening.  (I'm never really sure how authors feel when they've worked for months on a book, only to have it read in a few short hours!)  This is a well-written book with a consistent story line.  There is just the right balance of emphasis on the mystery and the underlying love story.  This book was first published 13 years ago and I'm sorry it has taken me this long to find it.  Highly recommended - am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.	2004-11-28
US	44596896	RBUDWIZY9EXM5	0972492607	554761838	Code Blue	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Less Than Exciting Second Book	I thoroughly enjoyed KatLyn's first book, Storm Surge, and was anxious to read Code Blue.  I gave this book three stars because I was able to finish reading it and all the plot lines were closed well by the end.  The story idea is good and is easy to follow.  However, I was disappointed with this book for several reasons.<br /><br />First of all, as with Storm Surge, the back cover mentions things that aren't really addressed in the story (i.e., \\"Logan McGregor...losing the love of her life in an inexcusable way\\" - There is only a slight explanation of this and it doesn't seem to affect the character's approach to life and love in the book.)  I think this is more the publisher's fault than the author's, but the reader doesn't necessarily get the story they're expecting.<br /><br />Secondly, the first few chapters focus very heavily on the instantaneous relationship between the two main characters, but the murder investigation seems to take a back seat while these two go gallavanting.  The remainder of the book focuses on the murder investigation, but the relationship doesn't seem to be a part of the story at all.  On top of that, Storm Surge had too much sex, but this book has none at all.  The one time things start to get heavy both the reader and the characters are left hanging.  What a tease...	2004-11-27

The wealthy Veronica Cartwright hits practically-destitute Rose Grayson in the middle of the night, in the middle of a dark street, in the middle of winter...  Afraid for herself because she's been drinking, Ronnie takes the injured woman to the emergency room for treatment and tells them she found Rose lying in the road.  As one would expect, a romance develops between the main characters as they fight their own inner demons.<br /><br />Both the description on the back cover and the first chapter of the book suggest Ronnie is a complete snob.  This is a little misleading. It seems it's really her family, her mother in particular, that is truly stuck-up.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a stretch to find two such very different women coming together in this story.  There are also a lot of typos and grammatical errors - I find those particularly distracting.  But, hey, it is a romance novel and is very well written.<br /><br />This was my first B.L.Miller read and I loved it.  I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.	2004-11-24

The back cover describes police officer Conner Harris as a tough cop, however there is nothing in the story that backs up the description.  She is smart, sexy, and daring, but not necessarily tough.<br /><br />FBI Agent Alex Montgomery is really a pussy cat in disguise, but she is on a mission to avenge her previous lover's murder.<br /><br />These two come together under intense circumstances and hit it off immediately.  The story focuses mostly on their romance and includes almost too many sex scenes.  There is not a good balance between their relationship and the investigation.  However, it is well written and kept my attention (I read it in one night).  I didn't understand the need for the predictable plot twist at the end, but I would still recommend the book to anyone looking for a good first novel.  I'm planning to read Code Blue this weekend and can't wait to start.	2004-11-24

Novan's books and have read everything she has published.  This one is a definite DON'T MISS!<br /><br />I couldn't put it down and finished this 550 page book in two days.  Colonel Charlie Redmond and his Yankee troops make camp on property owned by Souther widow Rebecca Gaines.  Rebecca is impressed by this \\"gentleman\\" and is shocked to learn \\"he\\" is really a \\"she.\\"  As their relationship develops, Charlie is not sure whether Rebecca has fallen in love with the man or the woman.  With the support of the few people who know his secret, Charlie is able to come to terms with his new feelings and accept Rebecca's love for him.<br /><br />Because this book was loosely based on actual historical facts, I learned some things about the Civil War I had not known before.  I even looked up some of the events and people in the book and found the book to be historically accurate.  The fiction part of the story was just as good and I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose themself in the past.	2004-11-17

I have read and enjoyed many of Karin Kallmaker's books and \\"Substitute for Love\\" is among her best.  Holly has a mentally abusive aunt who has hidden her past, a clueless boyfriend who takes advantage of her in many ways, and new friends that open her up to a whole new world.  Reyna has a bigoted father who uses her mother's illness to blackmail her into submission.<br /><br />I liked the overall story and give it 5 stars.  However, Holly's newfound sexuality and immediate love connection with Reyna seem a little far fetched.  If you can accept that we read fiction to escape the real world and see the (almost) impossible happen, you'll enjoy this book immensely.	2004-11-10

Jo is tall with raven hair, deep blue eyes, and a violent past.  Cadie is petite with blond hair, beautiful green eyes, and a sheltered past.<br /><br />They meet when Cadie's long-time lover, a Senator named Naomi who reminds this reader of Callisto, schedules a vacation with friends to the Whitsunday Islands in Australia.  It is love at first sight, but Jo doesn't think Cadie can live with her past and Cadie has to deal with loose ends in her current relationship before they can act on their feelings.<br /><br />This is a long book, but I couldn't put it down.  Yes, there are a few obvious plot twists.  Yes, there are many uber moments.  But... there isn't a boring sentence in this book.  The characters are easy to love or hate.  The situations are original.  I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this genre and can't wait for Cate Swannell to publish again.	2004-11-10

Jo is a dispassionate woman that seems to \\"go with the flow\\" of others in her life (i.e., her parents and soon-to-be-ex-husband) until she meets the enigmatic Alex. She finds her dreams and her reality merging as their relationship develops.<br /><br />This story fits the basic recipe of a good love story, but Denison keeps the reader engaged throughout the story.

Karen Riggs is in a failing relationship and is struggling to keep her contracting business alive.  Melissa Wright is in a superficial relationship with a fashion model.  Neither woman truly realizes how unhappy she is until one day Ms. WRIGHT hires Karen to build her new home.  Both women struggle with their new attraction while trying to do the right thing.<br /><br />The attraction is immediate and I was expecting the U-haul to appear on every page, but the author keeps pulling in the reins on this fledgling relationship.  I find a lot of lesbian fiction to follow the same basic recipe, but this one was a little different.  It kept me interested and unsure of what would ultimately happen.  This one's a keeper.	2004-11-03

Jessica Thomas does a good job keeping the reader's attention.  She presents both obvious and hidden clues without revealing \\"who dunnit\\" too early.  The only shortcoming of this book was in the relationship between Alex and Janet.  The two women said \\"I love you\\" after only a few dates without any real build-up.	2004-10-31
