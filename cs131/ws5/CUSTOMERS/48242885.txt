Specifically, \\"The Summer Isles\\" by Ian R. Macleod was limited to 500 signed hardcovers, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher as well as on the internet.  It is also worth noting that Aio has made part of their mission to make books that are both ecologically friendly and visually appealing, and \\"The Summer Isles\\" doesn't disappoint.  The covers are wrapped in some sort of synthetic suede, with the binding a glossy black with stamped gold print and finally, the interior pages are printed on a heavier, creamier stock than generally seen in most books.  All these elements combine to create a book that offers an experience that goes beyond the words found inside. <br /> <br />That said, a pretty package isn't enough to carry a novel, and happily, \\"The Summer Isles\\" is as engaging on the outside as it is on the inside.  On its surface, \\"The Summer Isles\\" is a remarkably detailed alternate history, in which Germany won World War I, and fascism arose in Great Britain (or \\"Greater Britain\\" as it has come to be known).  And Macleod deserves a tremendous amount of credit for this creation.  He creates interesting parallels between Nazi Germany and Great Britain, but doesn't make them so obvious or literal as to make the story dull.  At the same time, he nicely winds up his alternate history with his characters, such that he can reveal it without resorting to the exposition which bogs down many other novels in the genre. <br /> <br />That said, it's what goes on beneath the surface that really draws the reader in.  Macleod is exploring not just the forces of history, but our very understanding of history.  At heart, what he has produced is a historiography of his own alternate history, which is a fascinating way to unfold a story.  Even his narrator is two different people depending upon the source, his real name of Griffin Brooke having been changed to Geoffrey Brook by forces quite beyond his control.  Likewise, he is a closeted homosexual (and quite understandably given the British regime) and as such, his own personal history is not what one would expect.   Finally, there is a tenuous thread connecting him to the effective dictator of the British Empire, John Arthur, and only Brook knows that man's own secret history. <br /> <br />In the hands of a less gifted novelist all of these convolutions and meditations would be distracting and tedious, but Macleod has weaved them into a tale so engaging it is impossible not to be drawn in.  He explores what is really a dual nature in human history, the tendency not to make waves, but the converse ability of people to rise above that comfort zone, to direct the forces of history, for good or ill, for at least a while.  At the time, our ability to act (or not act) upon this stage is limited by imperfect information, and as such the law of unintended consequences will win out as often as not. <br /> <br />I could go on, but I suspect that this is a novel that will mean many things to many people, and I likewise don't want to go on so long that I give the impression this is a dry, theoretical novel as nothing could be further from the truth.  \\"The Summer Isles\\" a fascinating alternate history, an engaging character study and a thoughtful meditation on the flow of history, not to mention a strong debut from a new small press.   <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-07-08
US	48242885	R19AC1M1N0Z8MB	0316803928	57845566	Los Angeles: A Novel	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Intriguing core, but far too much filler	\\"Los Angeles\\", Peter Moore Smith's follow-up to the superb \\"Raveling\\", starts interestingly enough with a romance between Angel Veronchek, son of a billionaire producer and mentally unstable albino, and his next door neighbor and part time stripper, Angela.  Moreover, as Smith toys with the chronology and draws into question Angel's reliability as a narrator, \\"Los Angeles\\" sets up to be a subtle meditation on reality, and the reliability of our own memory. <br /> <br />And ultimately it does, unfortunately in between there is far too much rambling discourse and irrelevant information.  At 338 pages, \\"Los Angeles\\" would have been far more successful at around 225, because when Smith finally hits his stride half way into the text, there are some genuinely fascinating twists and turns, but by then the reader is jaundiced by the slog that lead up to that point.  Moreover, Smith never seems quite sure what he wants this book to be.  With \\"Raveling\\", the reader knew from the start that something horrible had definitely happened, and it was left to the novel to reveal how and why.  With \\"Los Angeles\\" it's not at all clear what, if anything has happened, and Smith even seems comfortable with not much of anything happening at all. <br /> <br />This wouldn't be a problem if Angel's personal growth represented the focal point of the story.  However, Angel is a deeply disturbed individual and whatever progress he makes is as much the result of the pharmaceutical industry as his development as an adult, and as such is somewhat difficult to get excited about. <br /> <br />To be fair, when Smith finally gets to the heart of the issue, he deftly weaves together a reality that is utterly at odds with the reader's perception (as presented by Angel) and yet in no way contradictory to it.  Even then though, Smith's seeming uncertainty about his message rears it's head as an entirely unnecessary layer of cause and effect is tacked on over the final chapters. <br /> <br />Smith is clearly a talented writer, and I'll read any future books based upon the strength of \\"Raveling\\" alone.  Moreover, \\"Los Angeles\\" contains some genuinely original and interesting writing.  The problem is, there's too much miscellany getting in the way, and the result is what should have been a brisk short novel or even novella is stretched out into what feels like a bloated three hundred plus pages.  Not bad per se, but something of a disappointment, \\"Los Angeles\\" may be worth a read in paperback, but doesn't warrant a hardcover purchase.  As an alternative, if you are looking for something that deals with fractured realities, try Steve Erickson's tremendous \\"Our Ecstatic Days\\". <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-06-23
US	48242885	RAISCOX0ETA6I	0812974417	427020672	At the Mountains of Madness: The Definitive Edition (Modern Library Classics)	Books	4	91	97	N	Y	A nice edition, but nothing particularly new	This Modern Library Classic edition of H.P. Lovecraft's \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" is marketed as \\"the definitive edition\\", presented \\"in fully restored form\\".  However, while it is a nice, good quality trade paperback, the only thing that sets this edition apart from that found in the S. T. Joshi edited \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\" is a rather excellent introduction by China Mieville, and a non-fiction piece by Lovecraft himself, \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\".  I am admittedly no Lovecraft scholar, but I was hard-pressed to find any difference between this and the Joshi text, and there were certainly no significant differences in the plot. <br /> <br />That said, this is a nice book to have, and should be particularly considered by those who are looking to introduce themselves to Lovecraft.  \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" is perhaps the quintessential Lovecraft story as it draws masterfully on themes developed in his earlier writings.  Detailing the discovery of unimaginably old artifacts by an Antarctic exploration, the story revels in Lovecraft's primary concept of horror, namely, the cosmic insignificance and fragility of man.  As the narrator and his assistant descend into the stygian depths of an unspeakably ancient city, the tension derives not from anything traditionally evil, but rather utterly indifferent to humanity's well being. <br /> <br />Moreover, the elements of dislocation, of man being knocked of his perch at the apex of evolution work, if anything, even better than they did in the 1930's.  In an age when we are the precipice of understanding some of the most profound mysteries of life, \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" places all of humanity squarely in the boondocks of cosmic significance.  At the same time, \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" plays on the human love of exploration, and in this regard can probably be better appreciated today than in Lovecraft's time, when African and Antarctic explorations were uncovering things never before seen by western man (or man at all in the case of the poles).  In a world that is pretty much mapped and paved over, the reader can't help but revel in the strange newness of the discoveries found herein. <br /> <br />This edition also benefits from the introduction by China Mieville (the undeniable star in fantasy and weird fiction today), although it should be read after the story by new readers.  His insights into Lovecraft's era, influences and radical creativity (as well as appalling racism) offer tremendous insight into \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" specifically, and Lovecraft's work in general.  In fact, from the standpoint of literary analysis, if not personal history, Mieville's introduction surpasses those of Joshi in the Penguin published collections. <br /> <br />Finally, there is the Lovecraft essay which concludes the volume.  It's an interesting review of supernatural horror, and Lovecraft's commentary thereon.  It's fairly readable for a scholarly piece, and offers some interesting insight into his work, but it will still be of limited interest to the general reader. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this is a nice edition, which features an excellent introduction.  Publisher's notes indicating how this version differs from previously published editions are definitely missed, and in some ways detract from the reading for those who are familiar with the work as keeping an out for differences is genuinely distracting.  I would be hard-pressed to call this a must buy for anyone who already owns a published edition of \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\", but those new to Lovecraft would be well served by starting with this standalone version of  his best story. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-06-17
US	48242885	RIS9KLJNR24NA	0446576972	670656489	Dance of Death	Books	5	197	217	N	Y	The world of Preston and Child in one book.	In \\"Dance of Death\\" authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child have taken the logical step of something that has been occurring casually in their writing over the last three novels, they have pulled together all of their joint works (save \\"Riptide\\" which can be neither included nor excluded) into one cohesive universe.  The primary characters, Bill Smithback, Nora Kelly, Margo Green, Laura Hayward, Vincent D'Agosta and of course Aloysius Pendergast, have all been featured prominently in past works, and while I haven't been much of a fan of this inbreeding of plot lines, I have to admit that it is carried of with a great deal of panache.    \\"Dance of Death\\" is a sequel to the previous \\"Brimstone\\", and likewise represents the latest in an arc concerning Pendergast that began with \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" and continued in \\"Still Life With Crows\\".  As such, this isn't the best book to start with these authors, as some sections will border on the incomprehensible to new readers.  Dealing with a deadly grudge match between Pendergast and his brother Diogenes, \\"Dance of Death\\" cleverly sets up all of the previous Lincoln and Child novels as a training ground for the penultimate showdown between these two enigmatic geniuses, which will, at least as of this writing, find its denouement in next summer's book.  Thus be forewarned, that \\"Dance of Death\\" ends in a cliffhanger.  However, since it is obvious within the context of the book, and since the authors have been more than forthcoming about that fact, this is hardly a criticism.    It is worth noting that as with other recent Preston and Child novels, \\"Dance of Death\\" drifts away from the early science and story driven novels, and derives more of its tension from character development.  While this may disappoint some, it actually works quite well as the authors are now drawing on eight previous books, and as such they are capturing the themes and drama found in those prior works.  There's a little bit of  \\"Relic\\", a dash of \\"Thunderhead\\", a portion of \\"The Ice Limit\\", so on and so forth.  As Pendergast and his faithful Lieutenant D'Agosta are pulled ever deeper into Diogenes murderous plan, more than a few pieces snap satisfyingly into place.  At the same time the characters are used in unpredictable ways, so each new plot twist feels just a little more puzzling because of that.  Literally up to the last page Preston and Child throw one change-up after another at the reader.    In fact, the ending is one of the high points of the book, and speaks to a strong element that pervades the text, namely the fallibility of Pendergast.  \\"In Dance of Death\\" he is plainly surpassed by his brother, and his need to rely on friends makes him a much more compelling and human character than the polymath superman he has often become; a character which sadly verged on self caricature.  How this relates to the conclusion, and without offering any spoilers, is basically this: if you are going to end a book with a cliffhanger, make it a really good, really unexpected one that opens up avenues that were hinted at, but that are only plain in retrospect.    My one complaint is that the same tying together of different novels that makes \\"Dance of Death\\" so successful has also made the authors too clever for their own good.  It is one thing to use a neat bit of story-telling to link seemingly unrelated events, but quite another to riddle the book with self-referential tidbits and mundane inside jokes. In fact, some of the jokes step on their own toes as they reference the sequel to a book they wrote whose characters appear in this novel.  It's unnecessary, really distracting, and I frankly wish they would cut it out.    That complaint aside, \\"Dance of Death\\" is a brisk thriller that so nicely ties together what one might call the Preston/Child Mythos, it's almost impossible not to enjoy.  While definitely not for a newcomer, fans will be impressed by the quality of the writing (which improves with each book, the authors clearly take their craft seriously) and the numerous twists and turns.  I also appreciate the signal that this novel sends: that once the Pendergast arc is completed, the authors will branch back out into new stories; something which is necessitated by the engaging confluence of characters and stories.  As such, it feels like both the end and the beginning, which is certainly appropriate for the second book in a trilogy.    Jake Mohlman	2005-06-16

First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors.  Specifically, \\"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\\" by Mark Chadbourn was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher as well as on the internet.<br /><br />PS Publishing is known for putting out unique works, titles like \\"A Year in the Linear City\\" and \\"In Springdale Town\\" defy easy explanation, but \\"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\\" is in a class by itself.  On its surface, it presents the story of Danny's quest to find meaning and personal redemption in Richard Dadd's painting, The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke.  A prodigy who has wasted his talents on drugs and alcohol, Danny turns to the painting as a lifeboat after a near fatal overdose.<br /><br />The first thing one notices about Danny's narrative is that the timeline ebbs and flows like the tide rather than flowing smoothly from point A to point B.  In other circumstances this might be disruptive, but it actually matches quite nicely with Danny's mental state and creates further questions in the reader's mind about his reliability as a narrator.  As Danny begins to drift between our world and the Invisible World (the fairy world, the world of myths or dreams, etc.) Chadbourn quite effectively leaves his sanity open to doubt.<br /><br />However, it in its purposefully enigmatic conclusion that the book truly shines as Chadbourn manages to place questions of parenthood (and specifically one's own parents) with those of growing up into related signs of the same coin.  In particular, Danny's revelation that growing up shouldn't mean losing one's sense of wonder is both true and completely in keeping with the spirit of the book.<br /><br />Though less than one hundred pages long, \\"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\\" somehow manages to encapsulate one man's entire journey from personal growth from a child with the attitudes of an adult, to an adult with the attitudes of a child, and finally to an amalgam of the two that is healthier than either end of the spectrum.

US	48242885	RWGYQLTII2NQ6	141844538X	184332182	A Change of Regime	Books	4	10	10	N	Y	A powerful work of alternate history	First off, if you haven't read J. N. Stroyar's prior novel, \\"The Children's War\\" don't even attempt to tackle \\"A Change of Regime\\".  While the author does provide a summary, it is barely enough for someone who read and absolutely loved the book; a newcomer will be hopelessly lost within a dozen pages.  That said, \\"A Change of Regime\\" is a worthy follow-up to its predecessor.  While I don't believe anyone could do justice to such a tremendous debut, Stroyar comes very close. <br /> <br />Picking up more or less where \\"The Children's War\\" left off, Stroyar continues her exploration of a resistance centered in occupied Poland that has been fighting, with varying degrees of success, Nazi occupation for sixty years.  I don't wan't to risk too much in the way of spoilers for those new to the author, but fans will be pleased to know that much of the story continues to revolve around Zosia and Peter, although Zosia's brother, the infiltrator Richard, makes a welcome move to center stage. <br /> <br />As before, while the alternate history is impeccably researched and utterly believable, it is Stroyar's ability to work in issues relevant to our own world that makes \\"A Change of Regime\\" such a gripping read.  Even more interestingly, she was able to deftly adjusted her focus to encompass the issues surrounding 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror.  Stroyar quite eloquently explores the desperation that drives people to acts of terror, but ultimately rejects such approaches as degrading and self defeating.  Likewise, her consideration of whether a failure to act in the interests of humanity everywhere makes one complicit in acts of brutality echo both the justification for invading Iraq and other forceful democratization on the one hand, and the treatment of prisoners in places like Abu Grahib (or even the U.S.) on the other. <br /> <br />At the same time, new to this novel is a remarkable appreciation for the labyrinthine affairs of state that plague totalitarian regimes.  While the slow decay of Nazi Germany and the parallels to the U.S.S.R. were quite effectively conveyed in \\"The Children's War\\", in \\"A Change of Regime\\" she pulls back the veil and reveals the vicious, corrupt decrepitude that permeates the nation's faade.  The result is a book saturated with tension as Richard schemes his way to ever greater heights of power, all while trying to preserve his very soul. <br /> <br />My one complaint with the novel is that the relationship between Zosia and Peter is too strained to be effective early in the novel, and to easily resolved later.  While the reasons why they would have a dysfunctional relationship are manifold, within the context of the book it is just too bleak; surrounded by horror, they are needed to offer some hope and while they needn't always triumph over adversity, neither should they be prisoners of the past.  A corollary to this problem is that Zosia, and several other female characters drift from calculating to hysterical, and the result is what I am sure was a quite unintended, but nonetheless very real, denigration of their worth within the context of the larger resistance.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, this shortfall is easily forgiven as it is understandable given the context and inconsequential when compared to the larger issues in play.  Totally effective as an alternate history and yet equally powerful as an exploration of the dehumanization that comes with tyranny, \\"A Change of Regime\\" can be appreciated equally by genre and literary readers.  Given the remarkable experience I had reading the \\"The Children's War\\" I approached the sequel with some trepidation, but happily, Stroyar has proven that she has total command of her world and her characters, and I can only hope there will be another follow-up. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-06-14
US	48242885	R32BUHFBII2OS2	1857988833	449717498	The Drowned World	Books	4	34	38	N	Y	An interesting spin on the genre	Unlike most entries in the post-apocalyptic fiction genre, J. G. Ballard's \\"The Drowned World\\" deals not with the immediate aftermath of a global calamity, but with the long-term psychiatric implications of such an event.  Set some eighty years after an increase in solar activity has rendered most of the earth a tropical swamp, Ballard explores the human reaction to such a rapid change in geography and society at the most primal level.<br /><br />As such, it has more in common with the likes of Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" than \\"Alas, Babylon\\" or other contemporary works of apocalyptic fiction.  In fact, in many ways it presents itself as a post-modern retelling of Conrad's journey into man's baser instincts.  The main character, Dr. Kerans is an admirable stand in for Marolow, as like his literary predecessor he is both drawn to and repelled by his surroundings and what they do to him and those around him.  Likewise, his aptly named nemesis Strangman is so reminiscent of Kurtz, including his almost cult-like relationship with Africans (more on that later) it is difficult not to picture him as a Marlon Brando type character.<br /><br />However, what separates the two novels, and keeps \\"The Drowned World\\" from being entirely derivative, is that Marlow has a civilization, a real civilization, to fall back upon.  No matter his descent into the unknown, both internally and externally, there is always a thread, however tenuous, that he can use to pull himself back up out of the primitive.  Kerans, on the other hand, is stuck in a global Congo, and the so-called civilization he could fall back upon is a mere shell of what it was, scratching out an existence above the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.  As such, his backward drift into the primeval is both more intense and ultimately irrevocable.<br /><br />It is this backwards drift into something more primitive, but somehow better adapted to this new world that forms the compelling core of the narrative.  His discussion of genetic memory, of the hard-coding of our response to our environment by millions of years of evolution is both believable and engaging, and has at least some foundation in fact as reflected by man's near universal dislike of such things as spiders and snakes.  Wisely, Ballard doesn't attempt to draw any definitive conclusions, but rather leaves open the question of whether evolution is a one way street, or whether mankind is truly as adaptable as we suppose.<br /><br />Nicely juxtaposing this inner change is the change in society that necessarily attends such a radical change in the environment.  Most of what is left of civilization is regimented under a quasi-military system, apparently under the auspices of the U.N., and what is left of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.  Existing outside of this society are those who either refuse to let go, or who scratch out a living in a piratical sort of existence.  Strangman is one of the latter, and he forms Ballard's most compelling character.<br /><br />Not explicitly bad, although almost certainly insane, he forms the question of whether the necessities of survival trump twentieth century morality, or if the two need not be mutually exclusive.  As I mentioned above, his troop of African's forms the most puzzling aspect of \\"The Drowned World\\".  It is unclear whether Ballard is indicating that because they are black they are more primitive mentally, or because they came from a more primitive setting geographically, they are better equipped for survival in this new world.  Based upon the overall context of the novel I'm inclined to argue that the latter is the case, but I would be hard-pressed to categorically refute those who see racist overtones.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"The Drowned World\\" is worth reading for its uniqueness in the genre.  Forgoing questions of surivival which are taken as a given, it plumbs the depths of the human psyche looking for a more profound response to natural disaster.  As Kerans slips deeper into hisown mind the reader is left to question just how robust a creature man is.  With our long-term survival left in doubt, Ballard leaves open the possibility of man evolving into something else or just going extinct.  Although sometimes a little prone to lecturing, \\"The Drowned\\" world is still a fascinating and genuinely original contribution to the genre.<br /><br />Jake Mohlman	2005-06-01

Using a host of primary sources he draws the reader into what feels like a firsthand account of those grim days, all while remaining grounded in modern science and history.  Unfortunately, at its worst it is a meandering account full of poorly identified speculation that fails to effectively straddle history and science.  The result is an engaging, but ultimately uneven account that while worth reading fails to live up to its potential. <br /> <br />Kelly's introduction immediately reveals some of these flaws.  He offers an overview of how the plague arose in nature, how it burst out of its generally isolated ecological niche, and its impact on society and history.  There is much to commend this introduction, as it quite nicely captures the evolution of a pseudo-global economy, and its impact on the spread of the disease.  He also offers some interesting insight into where plague fits in the natural order, and how it made the jump from rodents to humans.  However, Kelly also tends to pass off assumptions of human behavior as fact, and frequently takes contemporary sources at face value, a cardinal sin in a history, but particularly when dealing with an era as steeped in superstition as the Middle Ages.  Moreover, a problem that plagues (no pun intended) \\"The Great Mortality\\" is that Kelly never seems quite sure if he wants to be primarily a historian or a scientist.  The result is a flirting with scientific theory that never quite meets expectations, and leaves the reader frustrated.  The flip side of the coin is a an over reliance on historical recreations where simple reference to the available source material would have been more effective, simpler and more academically honest. <br /> <br />These same problems continue to crop up throughout \\"The Great Mortality\\" but so do the positives.  In particular, Kelly does an excellent job of placing the impact of the plague within the context of societal and demographic change that so shaped the Renaissance and Reformation.    Most notably, he quite adeptly explores how the plague broke Europe out of a population/resource deadlock and drove innovation and the rise of European global dominance.  He quite rightly posits that in the absence of the plague and subsequent waves of disease could have left Europe as a cultural and economic backwater struggling to scrape out an existence on over-utilized land, much like the present day Third World.  However, he fails to extrapolate this impact to the rest of the world.  He makes several references to the tremendous death toll in China and India, and their role in the spread of the disease, but fails to give them equal consideration.  To a point, this is an unfair complaint as Kelly makes it clear he is focusing on the European Black Death.  However, his decision to paint (and quite correctly) a picture of a global community means he has to take a global view, and the failure to offer even a cursory summary of the plague in the East feels like unfinished business. <br />Ultimately, \\"The Great Mortality\\" provides a nice introduction to the Black Death, although if you are a real history buff you may find yourself (like me) looking for more rigorous follow up volumes.  At it's best, \\"The Great Mortality\\" offers a sterling view of the global implications of a pandemic, including sociological, economic, political and philosophical.  Unfortunately, this is often offset by unfinished thoughts and poorly explained details.  Kelly has produced an interesting, easy to read volume, and I would advise anyone with an interest in the period to check it out, but it could have been more. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-05-27
US	48242885	R3IQE9YE3563BT	0142180033	628692175	The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	19	20	N	N	A further exploration of Lovecraft	\\"The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories\\" represents the second of three (to date) collections of H. P. Lovecraft's work edited and annotated by J. T. Joshi and published by Penguin.  Like the preceding volume (\\"The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories\\") the stories unfold in the chronological order of their writing, allowing the reader to both observe Lovecraft's development as a writer, and the interlinking  of his developing mythos.  The only substantial differences between this volume and the former are that this one contains more stories within the Cthulhu Mythos, and it also contains Lovecraft's two longest (and to my mind best) works. <br /> <br />The book begins with an introduction from Joshi that readers of the first volume will probably find disappointing as it offers no meaningful difference to that books introduction.  It seems odd that someone who has chronicled Lovecraft's life as intently as Joshi has couldn't find a different avenue of consideration, and it is unfortunate that the same facts are repeated, regardless of how important they may be to understanding Lovecraft's writing. <br /> <br />Fortunately, that is the only black mark against Joshi's work as he has provided exhaustive foot-noting of each story.  Sometimes whimsical and sometimes critical, these observations open up an entirely new and deeper view of the stories in \\"The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories\\".  In particular, residents of New England in general and Rhode Island in particular will appreciate the impression that regional history and geography had on Lovecraft's writing. <br /> <br />As for the stories themselves, they are somewhat better generally than the first volume, which may simply be a reflection of my preference for the Cthulhu stories, or may alternately reflect that they are indeed better written (as I would argue).  The stand out contributions can be found in the final four entries, \\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\", \\"The Dunwich Horror\\",\\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" and \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\", all of which are noteworthy for both individual and common reasons. <br /> <br />\\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\", like all four stories, continues the evolution of Lovecraft's occult mythos, but it is most noteworthy (aside from being the longest piece he ever wrote) for the way that it inverts the traditional Yankee ghost/horror story.  Lovecraft removes, or rather reassigns, the supernatural and places it instead within the realm of a vast, seemingly unfathomable but quite literally real hidden world.  Likewise, \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" plays upon these same elements, but at the same time explores the deep mystery of New England's rural regions, and the dichotomy of the bustling coast and the relatively rural interior. <br /> <br />\\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" is my favorite Lovecraft story, and is significant in that it represent the most concrete conveyance of facts regarding the various \\"Old Ones\\" who ruled the earth untold millennia ago.  It also helped create the adventure/techno-thriller genre which is so prevalent today and which so frequently draws occult imagery and themes (the novels of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child being the best representation of this admittedly mixed bag).  Finally, \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\" is interesting in that it offers a sequel of sorts to the well regarded \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories\\" comprises another nice collection of stories by Lovecraft.  However, what really makes this edition stand out among other options are the fascinating contributions of Joshi which not only flesh out individual stories, but help place them within the larger context of Lovecraft's body of work, life experience and personal philosophies.  As such, this is a book which can be enjoyed equally buy long time fans and new readers alike. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-05-11
US	48242885	R2TOUO7JMBIMOB	0141182342	744273601	The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	4	119	125	N	N	Very nice introduction	Edited by J. T. Joshi, \\"The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories\\" offers an excellent, even scholarly, introduction to the tales of H. P. Lovecraft.  For those readers like myself who are relatively new to Lovecraft, this collection offers a nice broad brush look at some of his better know works.  At the same time, the extensive commentary and foot-noting means that even long time fans should find something new in this collection. <br /> <br />For those entirely unfamiliar with Lovecraft, this collection serves the additional purpose of explaining why one should read this enigmatic author.  Put simply, Lovecraft's merit lies as much in the ideas behind his stories as their actual execution.  In fact there are many who argue (with some merit) that Lovecraft wasn't much of an author.  He routinely uses far too many words to make his point, an error compounded by his tendency to repeat himself, and many of his plot lines border on self satire.  Nonetheless, he is revered because he reshaped the face of modern horror/fantasy.  He removes man from the focal point of all previous storytelling, and finds horror in our insignificance.  He creates a mythology (perhaps best personified in Cthulhu) in which beings both vastly older and infinitely more powerful than humans have lived and fought over untold eons.  It is their complete indifference and capriciousness the mankind that inspires horror. <br /> <br />At his best, Lovecraft captures this fear of the unknowable or unfathomable with an air of palpable menace.  By arranging the stories found in this collection in chronological order, Joshi allows the reader to see Lovecraft's growth as a writer, something that makes the final five entries all the more impressive.  \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", \\"The Colour Out of Space\\", \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\", \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\", and \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\" all beautifully capture the depth of Lovecraft's imagination.  Hinting at things just beyond human ken, he taunts the reader with dark mysteries and an escalating level of paranoia in the seemingly mundane unknown. <br /> <br />Hence, the breadth of his imagination exceeds his limitations as a writer.  Like any collection, especially one that covers a significant period of a writer's development, \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" is a mixed bag.  Nonetheless, more entries than not will have you glancing over your shoulder.  Moreover, given Lovecraft's influence on authors like Stephen King, not to mention emerging talents like China Mieville, it is interesting to explore his tales and consider their long term impact.  In many ways it is like listening to Muddy Waters in order to understand the Rolling Stones and the Beatles.  Finally, editor S. T. Joshi's fascinating notes help place both the author and his writings within a larger context. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-04-27
US	48242885	R3DBA1EUHV1YN8	074326472X	466739762	Our Ecstatic Days: A Novel	Books	5	18	19	N	N	A bizzare yet somehow effective amalgam of styles	\\"Our Ecstatic Days\\" is such an unusual novel, it perhaps makes the most sense to discuss what it is not first.  It is not a traditional novel in the sense that one character or group of characters progress through a chronologically coherent, or at least internally consistent timeline, to a definite conclusion.  Moreover, it does not follow the traditional arrangement of text, or the general way one expects a story to unfurl.  So, if you're not looking for something experimental, you've been warned, but I would encourage you to dismiss any preconceptions of what a novel should be and read on as this novel's content should surpass its structure for all but the most stubborn reader. <br /> <br />All that said, \\"Our Ecstatic Days\\" is one of the most powerful, remarkable novels I have encountered in quite some time.  Layering discussions of parenthood in general, motherhood specifically, chaos, empathy, and hope, this is the type of novel that will read differently to any two people.  However, both would have to agree that author Steve Erickson's use of unique mishmash of genres and styles, and even his avant garde structures somehow has produced a novel that is not only interesting, but absolutely gripping. <br /> <br />Trying to sketch out a plot would be next to impossible, but the general progression of the story involves one young mother Kristin's almost maniacal desire to see her son Kirk protected from an uncertain world.  As a lake slowly submerges Los Angeles, she attempts to sacrifice herself in order to save him, but in the process unleashes a string of fractured and alternate realities that somehow are all interconnected, and only one of which is \\"real\\" in the most totalistic sense of the word.  There are a host of critical interconnections between these realities, but the most compelling is the single line of italicized text that runs through the final two hundred thirty pages of the book, only to connect seamlessly with the conclusion of the alternate streams.  This stream of consciousness should be read in its entirety prior to picking up the rest of the narrative thread, and quite effectively captures how an entire lifetime can unfurl in the blink of an eye.  Moreover, it is a highly effective literal representation of the malleability of one's destiny, and perhaps one's past, that is central to Erickson's message. <br /> <br />To offer much more wouldn't so much spoil the plot as distract from it and corrupt the progression Erickson has set forth.  Suffice it to say that he makes impressive ninety degree turns in both timeline and voice that would be distracting if they weren't so effective and linking together events that are otherwise seemingly unrelated.   As he ties in the iconic figure of the man in front of the tanks at Tiananmen Square and the iconic image of 9/11 the novel progresses in increasingly fractured timelines across eighty years, American revolutions, the rise of cults and a other events to numerous to recount.  Hence do seemingly inconsequential interconnections lead more and more forcefully to a dualistic philosophy of logic/love/hope devolving into chaos only to give birth to the same. <br /> <br />At the core of this emerging dichotomy is parenthood, and it is in Kristin and Kirk's relationship that Erickson offers his most powerful imagery.  He displays a remarkable ability to express the wonder that parents see in their children, and further captures the edge placed on that wonder by the literally heartbreaking possibility of their loss.  In this knife's edge of love and devastation, Erickson explores the deal-making with God that every parent goes through; trading their happiness for their child's.  What no one can anticipate is what impact that very deal may have on the child, and can the consequences ever be reversed. <br /> <br />To place \\"Our Ecstatic Days\\" in context, it is a sort of a hybrid between \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\\" by Walter Miller and \\"House of Leaves\\" by mark Danielewski.While not as overtly religious as the former, it nonetheless plays with post-apocalyptic themes, and more importantly how the vagaries of time can twist the course of history into unexpected dimensions.  At the same time, while not quite as experimental as the latter, it nonetheless explores the power of the inner world and the nature of truth in a similar fashion.  Furthermore, it is in many ways thematically similar to Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" as both explore in depth the mystery of the female cycle; in particular, Kristin's relationship with the lake strongly echoes Morgaine's relationship with water in Bradley's work.  There's definitely an element of modern paganism, which is somehow grounded in our modern day realism that infuses \\"Our Ecstatic Days\\" and strongly echoes Arthurian traditions. <br /> <br />It is likely that many will dismiss this novel for its structure without ever analyzing its content which would be unfortunate in the case of any novel, but particularly so in this instance.  Steve Erickson has produced in \\"Our Ecstatic Days\\" a powerful, moving look at parenthood and finds in it a love so powerful it just might be able to save the world, or at least or souls.  Almost certain to  stand as one of the best novels of 2005, it is a unique, utterly absorbing creation that begs to be read. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-03-30
US	48242885	R3BWXCM5JS6NVI	006058565X	366651160	The Cat's Pajamas: Stories	Books	4	16	16	N	N	A literary tour of sixty years	Ray Bradbury is the consummate short story writer of the twentieth century, and this due in large part to the remarkable sense of time and place that he brings to his work.  Pick up a copy of \\"The Illustrated Man\\" or \\"The October Country\\" or \\"Dandelion Wine\\" and you will immediately find yourself nostalgic for a time and place that maybe never was.  Moreover, his ability to tie his collections together with common thematic elements makes reading any one of these books feel like something greater than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />\\"The Cat's Pajama's\\" however, is a collection that spans some sixty years of his writing, and as such, the stylistic and thematic elements that usually lend cohesion to Bradbury's collections are noticeably absent.  The result is a book better nibbled at than devoured.  The lack of cohesion can be jarring, and in some ways distracts from the quality of the individual works, but when properly approached, these stories are everything a Bradbury fan could want. <br /> <br />This eclectic collection features some vintage Bradbury, as well as some interesting departures.  Examples of the former are the classically creepy \\"Sometime Before Dawn\\" and the quirky science fiction of the \\"Mafioso Cement-Mixing Machine\\".  While written some fifty years apart, they nonetheless share Bradbury's classic sense of style and timing.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the satirical \\"Hail to the Chief\\" in which some bad bets reverse five hundred years of American history, and the powerful, but definitely unexpected look at a marriage in \\"Where's My Hat, What's My Hurry?\\". <br /> <br />Other highlights include the noir-ish \\"A Careful Man Dies\\", as well as \\"The Ghosts\\" which explores the supernatural in a way only Bradbury can.  \\"The Transformation\\" is a remarkably blunt (given that it was written in 1948) look at racial prejudice and violence in the south, albeit from a startlingly different angle.  Finally, there are the touchingly sweet \\"The Cats Pajamas\\" and \\"(A Remembrance)\\" the latter of which is most reminiscent the bittersweet nostalgia of \\"Dandelion Wine\\". <br /> <br />There are a few head-scratchers in this collection, mostly because of an overabundance of ambition for a short work rather than flawed premise.  However, overall \\"The Cat's Pajama's\\" is a unique retrospective on the evolution of Bradbury's work.  As such, it is a real treat for longtime fans, but also a great introduction for new readers. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-03-21
US	48242885	R131F26HXFBVJ8	0375719350	847115571	The Man Who Japed	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Intriguing content saves sometimes lackluster story	\\"The Man Who Japed\\" is a fairly early Philip K. Dick novel, and as such is somewhat dated, and a little more straight-forward stylistically.  In many ways it reads like early Bradbury; those looking for true science fiction will probably be put off by the simplistic technology.  However, as with Bradbury, the powerful message transcends the context and drives the novel forward. <br /> <br />Like many of Dick's novels, \\"The Man Who Japed\\" is set in a post-apocalyptic future, in this instance, some two hundred years after a nuclear war in the 1970's.  Society is now governed by a strict moral code that emphasizes utility over comfort and social enforcement of societal mores.  Enter Allen Purcell, an otherwise successful creator of \\"packets\\" (morality propaganda purchased by the state) who has inexplicably \\"japed\\" the statue of Major Streiter, founder of the Morec (moral reclamation) society.  As his world begins a slow motion unraveling he comes to question everything about the society that has supported his family for generations. <br /> <br />This perspective on morality as the driving force in politics is oddly prescient with today's debates about abortion, gay marriage and the like.  Dick, has taken this evolution to its logical, but insane conclusion, in which every person is held to account by their neighbors in what is theoretically a people's court, but which is in fact an on-going witch hunt in which anonymity allows vicious personal vendettas to be aired with impunity. <br /> <br />Admittedly, the actual story meanders and is not particularly engaging.  While Purcell evolves into a rather intriguing character, by and large the supporting cast is rather two dimensional.  To a degree this is understandable, as Dick is after all trying to create a world of cardboard cutouts.  Nonetheless, this can make for a rather dry read at times. <br /> <br />A short novel with a powerful message, \\"The Man Who Japed\\" offers a glimpse into Dick early in his career.  While the wit and thoughtfulness is on ready display, his story-telling abilities are not yet at the level of \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" or \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"  As such, this probably isn't the best novel for those new to the author to start, but it will definitely be appreciated by fans of his other work. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-03-15
US	48242885	R8OFZ17CNE42O	0618509283	528177434	The Plot Against America: A Novel	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Coming of age in Lindbergh's America	It's hard to know where to begin with Philip  Roth's \\"The Plot Against America\\", largely because it is a book that can present itself as different things to different people.  Some will focus on the allo-historical content, and treat it as a standard alternate history, albeit one told from an unusual point of view.  Others will read a cautionary tale, with disturbing parallels to our own world.  Finally, there are those who will read the poignant coming of age of the book's author in a world that has been badly warped out of the comfortable nostalgia we expect.    All of these viewpoints are valid, and in fact critical to appreciating the work, but it is only when the book is considered in it's totality that it can be appreciated.  Spanning just a few short years from 1940 to 1942, \\"The Plot Against America\\" reveals the knife's edge we as individuals, as families and ultimately as a country walk between normality and chaos.  As the isolationist, anti-Semite Charles Lindbergh sweeps FDR out of office, an eight year old Philip Roth becomes a prism through which to view the rising tide of fear and bigotry that ensues.  This choice of narrator has an interesting effect, as children generally assume a certain status quo; a belief that regardless of what is going on in the greater world, their lives will remain largely intact.  However, when change does come it is often viewed as abrupt (regardless of the warning signs) and terrifying.  This presentation nicely parallels the tendency towards inward looking policy and a certain naivet in world affairs that characterized American policy in the first half of the century, and in some ways, still does today.  Likewise, this desire to cling to an idealized, even fictional, past can have unexpected repercussions; a national unwillingness to grow up has been a major problem for the United States, and still taints both our sense of self and our worldview.    As such, \\"The Plot Against America\\" is undeniably cautionary; Roth makesstrong arguments that democracy is only ever a backslide away from fascism; that it is the duty of the average American to remain constantly on guard against the creeping loss of rights.  However, to make the leap that Roth is referring specifically to the current administration is to my mind flawed.  The set of circumstances are too different, and the overarching theme of the novel to distant from partisan politics for this to be anything other than a secondary consideration.  Certainly, Roth's message of active democracy is one which should be embraced, and is in some ways pertinent to this, and many other administrations, but to ascribe partisan dogma to \\"The Plot Against America\\" dilutes its powerful story.    This story of the time when Roth's imagined childhood ended in a wave of confusion and strife is ultimately far more powerful than any alternate history or political elements.  While these devices inform the narrative, it is Roth's reaction to them that raise this novel to the status it has achieved.  I defy anyone to read Roth's simple, but convincing, words and not be drawn back to their own childhood traumas.  This is really what makes the book's ultimate message of hope, hope for ourselves and for our democracy so convincing.  Just as we survived our own childhood fears and tragedies, so too has the United States survived assaults on the Constitution, even from such luminaries as Lincoln and Wilson.    My one complaint with \\"The Plot Against America\\" is that the narrative flow shifts abruptly for significant portions of the final third of the novel.  Roth's first person accounts fade and the presentation changes to a third person recounting of the convergent alternate history.  While nicely told, if rather unrealistic, this change of pace is very distracting, and commits the cardinal sin of alternate history: exposition.  If details can't be revealed within the normal progression of the novel, they probably shouldn't be included.    While this odd stylistic change badly delays the novel's conclusion, \\"The Plot Against America\\" is still a fascinating, touching work.  Above all a story of one child's response to events entirely outside of his control, one cannot help but be drawn to the tragedies and triumphs of his day to day world.  For the most, part Roth is successful in using his alternate history and political considerations as tools to tell his tale rather than making them the focal point of the novel.  While sometimes straining credulity, they are nonetheless thoughtful and engaging, and help make \\"The Plot Against America\\" entirely worth of the accolades it has received.

US	48242885	R136JPCB5WA79Q	1902880773	290608329	Jigsaw Men	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Remarkable blend of genres	First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors.  Specifically, \\"Jigsaw Men\\" by Gary Greenwood was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher.  Moreover, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so. <br /> <br />A big problem with many alternate histories is the need for exposition at the expense of plot.  For example, an author spends so much time explaining why the South won the Civil War, precious little time is left for characters to interact and grow in the altered timeline.  One would expect that this situation would be compounded in a novella, where length becomes a limiting factor, and then compounded again by the odd amalgam that forms the backbone of Gary Greenwood's \\"Jigsaw Men\\".  It's hard enough to succinctly portray the above scenario, but Greenwood has gone far beyond that relatively simple scenario, as he posits the \\"what ifs?\\" of a world in which Dr. Frankenstein succeeded in making his monster and Martians invaded and were beaten off as predicted by H. G. Wells.  Happily, Greenwood succeeds admirably; producing a world that is drastically altered, nicely realized and fully believable, and at the same time, introducing an engaging plot and characters, and all the while drawing relevant parallels to our own world. <br /> <br />If it wasn't for the setting, \\"Jigsaw Men\\" would be a noir-esque detective thriller.  Loaded with all the elements of the genre (seedy locales, prurient scandals, streetwise cops) the mystery would be compelling enough without any allo-historical element.  However, it is this altered timeline that really makes the story; it elevates what would be an entertaining, but generic, mystery into an interesting commentary on morals, and international relations.  The British Empire of Greenwood's timeline is plainly a metaphor for the U.S. today, and in many ways his Prussia is today's UK.  In \\"Jigsaw Men\\" Britain is still an Empire, and the globe's dominant power, with Prussia as a staunch, if somewhat restive ally.  Furthermore, much like today, no matter how benevolent the UK attempts to be, there is an element of hubris which colors its actions.  Thus, a relatively straightforward disappearance becomes a major espionage crisis as Greenwood questions whether cracks in hegemony must become holes, and whether or not that is a bad thing. <br /> <br />Now that I've spent so much time saying why Greenwood has produced something beyond a merely altered timeline, I feel obligated to state how much I loved the purely alternate history elements.  The premise is engaging enough, but Greenwood takes it in directions I never would have expected.  To delve too deeply might spoil the plot, but Frankenstein Monsters as the ultimate soldiers and Martian technology as the greatest State secret of Great Britain are just two of the interesting ideas put forward.  However, it is the small things that make or break an alternate history, and Greenwood comes up with plenty to make his story feel familiar but foreign.  Again, I don't want to give anything away, but my personal favorite was a sly reference to the passions of British soccer fans: he mentions fans of rival teams have friendly chats after games. <br /> <br />Like most things in literature (or life) there's no right or wrong way to write alternate history.  However, truly great additions to the genre transcend the academic exercise of imagining another world (which is no mean accomplishment when done well) and reveal something fundamental about the human condition, or even more interestingly, our values and culture.  To my mind, no one has done this better than J. N. Stroyar in her massive \\"The Children's War\\".  Likewise, another PS Publishing title, Ken Macleod's \\"The Human Front\\", offered an intriguing critique of political systems, and was, like \\"Jigsaw Men\\" an unusual premise in a short form.  Both of those books won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History; it is my expectation that \\"Jigsaw Men\\" will get a long, hard look for the award, and it would not surprise me in the least if it resulted in a trophy for Gary Greenwood and PS Publishing. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-03-02
US	48242885	R3O8NJTK6SLNE7	0765311720	147291883	Behemoth: Seppuku (Bk. 2)	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Satisfying conclusion to a fascinating series	First off, for those of you haven't already read \\"Behemoth: B-Max\\" (at least) you will definitely want to do so before tackling \\"Behemoth: Seppuku\\".  For reasons that the author explains in the first volume, they constitute one book that was split into two due to pressures in the publishing issue.  This novel does not stand alone, and will make no sense without reading the previous volume.  Furthermore, there are two other volumes in the series \\"Starfish\\" and \\"Maelstrom\\" and while each entry stands on its own fairly well, reading the books in order would definitely be the approach I would recommend. <br /> <br />For those of you who are new to the series, here is a brief synopsis that should tell you whether or not these books are for you.  Essentially, the story arc is about evolution: human, animal and electronic.  By mixing a blend of biology, computer science and chaos theory, author Peter Watts has created a near future Earth where man is simultaneously at the height of his powers and walking the knife's edge of total ecological failure.  In an effort to maintain the high standard of Western living mankind has turned to deep sea geothermal power to meet their energy needs.  Miles below the ocean, specially engineered humans culled from the dregs of society maintain these power plants.  However, what no one could have expected was that they would encounter an organism that would unleash an apocalypse.  Part hard science-fiction, part post-apocalyptic, the first two books represent a genuinely original voice in the genre. <br /> <br />For those of you who have been eagerly awaiting \\"Seppuku\\" rest assured the ending is eminently satisfying.  Given the two volume approach, it is difficult to offer much in the way of plot details without providing spoilers, but I can say that after the somewhat broader focus of \\"Maelstrom\\" and \\"B-Max\\" the story has gone full circle and boiled back down to the most perverse trinity of characters one is likely to find: Lenie Clarke, Ken Lubin and Achilles Desjardins.  As the three engage in a power-play in which no one's motivations are clear and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, action takes precedence over thought, to sometimes disastrous effect.  Nonetheless, the science and technology which has so defined this series is on ample display and is as prescient as ever.  <br /> <br />Of particular note, I found the conclusion to be perfectly enigmatic.  This is post-apocalyptic fiction, and a happy ending would have been wildly out of place, but Watts' conclusion recognizes this without being entirely bleak.  In this regard, his novel owes more to \\"Alas, Babylon\\" with it's open ended conclusion, than the superb, but utterly fatalistic \\"On the Beach\\". <br /> <br />To say more would risk huge spoilers, so suffice it to say \\"Sepukku\\" is every bit the conclusion I was hoping for.  Watts has combined hard science fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction and taken both in new and exciting directions.  If you're a fan of the series, you'll be glad at the way it ends; if you're intrigued by this review, grab \\"Starfish\\" and start from the beginning. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-02-28
US	48242885	R3GIFZJTKRZUY7	0375406972	667466602	Snow	Books	4	9	12	N	Y	Nature/Nurture, Internal/External, what makes the man?	In \\"Snow\\" Orhan Pamuk has produced a deeply personal novel about the inherent contradictions of his native country of Turkey.  Sitting on the crossroads of East and West, Pamuk has distilled Turkey's national identity crisis into the border town of Kars, and then further refined it into the person of the poet Ka. <br /> <br />Having recently returned from political exile in Germany for the funeral of his mother, Ka becomes drawn to the suicides of young women in Kars; women who are being forced from school by the secular government for wearing religious head scarves.  At the same time, he is curious about Ipek, the object of his desire from his university days who has recently become available.  With this relatively straightforward setting, Pamuk has set in motion a host of story lines, all of which reflect the unique duality of Turkey.   <br /> <br />Ka has gone to investigate the suicide of girls who are so religious suicide should be an abhorrence to them.  He has gone to seek love and life even as his excuse for the trip is death.  He finds Kars to be a place of wretched poverty, but also find sublime beauty in its snow covered vistas.  Thus as a troop of performers turns their theater of the absurd into an absurd reality in the form of a military coup, the reader is buffeted between a string of polar opposites that are somehow part of a greater whole.  It is Ka's pursuit of this whole that drives him from the company of atheists to religious students to terrorists to communists and back again.  While this bizarre panoply of characters and motivations can be confusing at times, it is quite effective at setting the reader on edge and keeping one reading through passages that for all their beauty can slow to a crawl. <br /> <br />Which brings me to my one complaint about \\"Snow\\": while Pamuk writes with an incredible lyricism, and while he is furthermore writing about a poet who should be expected to view the world differently, his prose can nonetheless be a challenge at times.  For example, one can only read about Ka pondering the snow so many times before a poetic scene begins to take on a type literary demagoguery.  Shaving fifty pages would have vastly sped up the narrative flow, and only heightened the conflict in the novel by compressing it. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, \\"Snow\\" is a beautiful, thoughtful novel that asks more questions than it answers.  Deeply biographical, Pamuk offers the best and worst of his country, and his westernized avatar Ka offers a window into this fascinating, but deeply divided nation for the American reader.  Finally, I should add that the translator deserves a great deal of credit as the beauty of the prose (insomuch as I can determine) has lost nothing in translation.  A challenging, sometimes slow read, \\"Snow\\" is well worth the time invested. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-02-17

However, if the idea of a fresh, wholly original take on all of these genres appeals to you, read on.  \\"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\\" is at its heart, and amalgam; an amalgam of styles, of genres, of themes, and yet somehow author Cory Doctrow has managed to weave these disparate elements into a cohesive whole. <br /> <br />At its heart, this is the story of Julius, a post-modern man who is a centenarian living in Disney World.  His is a world without scarcity or death, and as such, the dynamics of economies have changed radically.  A person's rank in society is based upon their \\"whuffie\\", essentially the measure of their esteem within the breadth of the human population.  While this meritocracy has certain appeals, it is still subject to the capriciousness of human nature, and as such, is still subject to many of the challenges of any of the systems the world currently enjoys (or doesn't).  In particular, the need to use esteem in order to achieve capital means that non-stop consensus building plagues most aspects of life and diverts it into entirely unexpected directions. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the crux of Julius' dilemma, namely he has been killed to facilitate another \\"as hoc\\" seizing control of the Hall of Presidents, and now his new body is experiencing difficulties with it's internal computing capabilities and, worst of all, the Haunted Mansion may be the next ride to succumb.  As Jules and his ad hoc fight to save the ride from losing it's 20th century charm, the pressure really begins to mount. <br /> <br />All this may sound absurd, but within the context of the story it works quite brilliantly.  Doctrow introduces a host of interesting sociological and technological theories without becoming pedagogic, while at the same time exploring issues that are fundamental to any society.  Inparticular, he questions whether humans can ever be truly happy absent conflict and purpose, and as such, what happens when the most mundane things become one's raison d'etre.   Is it funny and absurd that his characters fight a war of sorts over a Disney ride, or is it sad, or is it both? <br /> <br />In \\"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\\" Doctrow has produced a thoroughly original novel, that is both a fun read and a thoughtful look at society.  He introduces a host of fascinating directions for human and societal evolution, but manages to maintain the reader's interest in a story that would be absurd out of context.  Finally, his whuffie based economy has surpassed Ken Macleod's anarcho-capitalism (\\"The Stone Canal\\") as my favorite fictional political system, without ever bogging down in philosophical debate or confusing jargon.  Great satire, great science fiction, this is a treat that is not to be missed. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-01-27
US	48242885	R104J40ZQOCLTZ	0151010749	382155161	The Ghost Writer	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Great novel, but a somewhat puzzling ending	It's hard to know where to begin with a novel like \\"The Ghost Writer\\"; most novels are built up in layers, with previous levels supporting those above, but in this case, the layers are peeled back like a sort of archaeological dig with the subsequent uncertainty that goes with such an endeavor.  Happily, it is a challenge well worth undertaking as \\"The Ghost Writer\\" is the rare literary novel that reads like a thriller.  As other readers have intimated, it is almost impossible to put down and its labyrinthine structure and subtle horror kept me reading well into the night. <br /> <br />At its most basic level, \\"The Ghost Writer\\" is a two pronged tale that deals with Gerard Freeman's pursuit of his mother's mysterious and oddly absent family and his pen-pal Alice, who he takes to be his one true love.  One would expect that these plot lines would become entangled, and they do, but what sets this novel apart is how author John Harwood manages to continually take the narrative at right angles from where the reader expects it to flow.  At the same, time, he interjects gothic ghost stories written by a key character (who I won't name for fear of ruining the plot).  At first, these abrupt changes in content and flow can be jarring, but as they draw the reader in they make for a fascinating change of pace.  Moreover, as they start to reveal aspects of Gerard's mother's life, they begin to resemble jigsaw puzzle pieces which the reader must assemble in order to solve the deeper mysteries in play.  Harwood wisely is neither to clever nor to obvious with these stories, and the result is a sensation of taking two steps forward and one step back. <br /> <br />While the plot and structure are undeniably what make this novel, it would be unfair to view the characters as mere baggage.  In fact, part of what makes \\"The Ghost Writer\\" so interesting is that it is essentially a one man show.  Many characters, many important characters, come and go through the course of the novel, butthey are only ever seen through the prism of Gerard.  As such, his hopes and emotional state color every other aspect of the work, and even as the reader can see certain elements developing in advance, they can only experience them through Gerard.  In particular, the one sided view of his relationship with Alice is critical, and could never have been handled as adroitly in the third person. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I found the ending to be either to abrupt or too enigmatic or perhaps both.  On a very general level, I understand that the author was trying to make a statement about hope and redemption, but within the context of the story I felt that there were too many loose ends left lying about.  I will admit that it is possible that upon re-reading, all will become clear as seemingly insignificant details from the ghost stories reveal themselves.  Nonetheless, a more effective denouement would have made this a more satisfying read.  Ultimately, while I respect the literary decision to write an open-ended novel, I think Harwood may have been too clever by half in this instance. <br /> <br />However, this should in no way detract from what is an engaging, well written novel.  Harwood's interesting story within a story approach and the crisscrossing narrative make for a stimulating read.  At the same time, Harwood has managed to develop a tremendous sense of impending horror that permeates the novel, but in a manner that is not oppressive.  The result is a well executed plot that justifies it's convoluted approach with genuine thrills and a main character who the reader is drawn too.  \\"The Ghost Writer\\" is the rare beast that is both literary and a great read while detracting from neither aspect, and is definitely not to be missed. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2005-01-25
US	48242885	R3FU5F4ZFITUAK	0520237315	884148645	Beasts of Eden: Walking Whales, Dawn Horses, and Other Enigmas of Mammal Evolution	Books	4	15	15	N	Y	Not exactly what I expected, but still excellent	If you are looking for a survey of mammal species, a sort of wildlife guide, \\"Beast of Eden\\" is probably not the book for you.  While author David Rains Wallace does offer interesting insight into a variety of different animals, this isn't a detailed zoological guide.  Rather it is a survey of the development of theories of mammal evolution, which is interesting in its own right, but not entirely clear from the title.    That said Wallace has painted an amazing portrait, and I use this metaphor purposely.  He has used Rudolph Zallinger's \\"Age of Mammals\\" mural from Yale's Peabody Museum to frame his discussion.  As someone who grew up in New Haven and spent countless visits to the museum marveling at the mural and its associated specimens, I couldn't have been more delighted by this decision.    This approach serves a double purpose, the obvious one being that the mural's rather sophisticated visual portrayal of mammal evolution provides a nice counterpoint to Wallace's discussion.  However, it also is inextricably tied the overall discussion as O.C. Marsh was in many ways the founder of North American paleontology and also the head of paleontology at Yale and the Peabody museum.  His so called \\"bone-wars\\" with Edgar Cope of The American Museum of Natural History (among other locales) drove the development of numerous theories of mammal evolution, and while their rivalry was childish at best and the theater of the absurd at worst, it provided a dynamic environment which drove a host of brilliant paleontologists to their chosen field.    These bone-wars, and Darwin's theory of evolution provide the jumping off point for a survey of mammal evolution and it's associated theories.  From neo-creationist arguments to Gould's punctuated equilibrium, Wallace provides a step by step evaluation of the rise and ebb of various arguments, and quite interestingly, links them into a whole.  All too often, scientific theories are treated as emerging fully formed, as if from a vacuum, and while that occasionally occurs, it is more the exception than the rule.  What Wallace has created in \\"Beasts of Eden\\" is a history of the evolution of evolutionary theory.  In effect, this is a tribute to all the minds who have contributed to our understanding of who we are.    The primary reason that he is successful in this endeavor is that he is able to link species studied by one era/scientist to another.  For example, Marsh was a student of horse evolution, and Wallace is able to trace the growth of this field as different scientists add to the base he provided.  From linear progressions of ever ascending species, to parallel lines of evolution to cladistic diagrams and genetic analysis, Wallace presents evolution as we understand it today by explaining the journey.    I should warn that while not a scientific article, Wallace makes free use of scientific terms and quotes from scholarly sources.  While one hardly need be a PhD to absorb and appreciate this work, some grounding in the life sciences will definitely make \\"Beasts of Eden\\" a more accessible work.    As I said before, \\"Beasts of Eden\\" isn't what it at first appears to be, but if you can stick with it, it provides a fascinating history of mammal paleontology.  If the history of science isn't you're cup of tea, this may not be up your alley, but the framework it provides for future explorations in mammal speciation makes it a worthy addition to your bookshelf.

US	48242885	RGN12YRW47AXG	0385500998	489310389	The Virtues of War: A Novel of Alexander the Great	Books	4	3	8	N	N	Another superb historical thriller from Pressfield	In his fourth novel, \\"Virtues of War\\" Stephen Pressfield has proven that he is a master at blending history with fiction.  As with his previous novels, Pressfield has taken events from ancient Greece, in this case the life of Alexander the Great, and woven them together with threads and voices of his own creation to produce a fictional, but startlingly real, tale.  What sets apart \\"Virtues of War\\" from his prior novels is the author's relentless focus; much like his subject, Pressfield has stripped away the fat and driven the story forward at a relentless pace. <br /> <br />This is due in part to the use of the first person; the historical Alexander was a man whose reach always exceeded his grasp, and as such he was driven forward when other men would have stopped to enjoy the fruits of their accomplishments.  As such, Pressfield couldn't dally in his telling, as long winded considerations of campaigns and locales, while perhaps fascinating in their own right, would have been at odds with Alexander's vision.  This focus is revealed most obviously in the almost complete absence of any discussion of the campaign into and out of Egypt.  Like Alexander, Pressfield's narrative eyes Persia and points east, and all other campaigns are treated as extraneous. <br /> <br />As always, Pressfield has a rare gift for describing the dust and mayhem of an ancient battlefield, but in \\"Virtues of War\\" he nicely sets this at odds with Alexander's strategic and tactical brilliance.  Without bogging the reader down in a lot of technical details, he is able to portray how Alexander is able to dictate the course of the battle through his dispositions and planning, even as the issue on the ground is always a sword's breadth away from turning against him.  This contrast between order and chaos infuses the narrative, and mirrors Alexander's own personal torments. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the book's high point, Pressfield's portrayal of Alexander.  He rather cleverly frames this enigmatic figure as someone who is possessed, or perhaps in more modern terms, plagued by a split personality.  There is Alexander the man, even Alexander the solider, who is driven by great ambition, but who is possessed of some self control and human frailty.  However, there is also Alexander's inner daimon, which is much colder, much more calculating.  It will stop at nothing to achieve its ends, even if it destroys the humanity of its host in the process.  This internal dichotomy is a clever narrative device which both frames the seeming mental imbalance of the historical Alexander, while setting him apart from the lesser mortals who are his compatriots. <br />There is also a cautionary element in Pressfield's writing; a significant portion of the novel deals with the pacification of Afghanistan.  While historically accurate, the metaphor to America's War on Terror is obvious as Alexander is sucked into a vortex of brutality and futility in which he becomes that which he hates. <br /> <br />Finally, there is the conclusion, which subtly plays upon Alexander's hubris.  As his army turns back from India his time for conquest is over, and thus his time is over.  In the end he became defined by war and in its absence, he and his daimon simply fade away.  While there are manifold tales of how Alexander actually died, it is ultimately irrelevant to this story as Pressfield's focus is defined by Alexander's ambition, and with his passing, further narrative would have killed the pacing of the book. <br /> <br />In \\"Virtues of War\\" Pressfield has produced yet another approachable and engaging historical novel.  While not always entirely true to history as it happened (a fact which he quite openly admits) he is always true to the spirit of events, and his narrative is so loaded with detail that even the informed reader will appreciate the level of research and realism.  A delight for history readers, but equally approachable for the fan of military fiction, \\"Virtues of War\\" isanother great entry from an author who is redefining the genre of historical fiction. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2004-12-27
US	48242885	R26F9R49YJWJV9	1892389657	904114311	The Fourth Circle	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Dazzling writing, but rather disappointing novel	It's rare that one finds a disconnect between the talent of a writer and the quality of his story.  As a general rule, one expects that a gifted writer will produce great novels and vice versa.  Unfortunately, in the case of \\"The Fourth Circle\\" the reader is treated to a novel that is supremely well written, but which is somehow empty at its core. <br /> <br />Told through seemingly unrelated narratives that are parsed out over seemingly random intervals, \\"The Fourth Circle\\" is an ambitious attempt to offer a cosmogony, a structure and perhaps purpose for the universe.  While taken as individual units, each story is beautifully structured and written, but as a whole the book is somehow less than the sum of its parts, which is ironic given its lofty ambition. <br /> <br />The ultimate problem is that there is no comprehensive denouement; the reader is drawn into the story of a pregnant artificial intelligence, Sherlock Holmes' last case, the life of alien six armed beings and more, but ultimately the links between these narratives, which define the whole structure of the novel, are lacking.  Whether this is because Zivkovic is being intentionally enigmatic or because he just wrote himself into a corner is uncertain, but I think most readers would agree that the payoff, such as it is, is severely lacking. <br /> <br />Which is a shame, because as I have stated above, Zivkovic is a writer of great talent.  His phrasing and word selection is impeccable, and he is a master of capturing the mood.  From levity to disgust to a sense of otherworldly wonder, his work is imbued with emotion.  Moreover, each individual vignette stands nicely on its own, with a particularly impressive entry detailing the exploits of a medieval painter and his humble assistant.  Unfortunately, as I have stated above, such laudable accomplishments are not sufficient to make a book with this multi-linear approach work.  In the absence of an overarching cohesion, these are just short stories printedout of order. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I don't want the potential reader to dismiss \\"The Fourth Circle\\" out of hand.  As I have stated, the author's writing is superb and makes for an enjoyable diversion, and while the novel may fall short, it's complex structure and grand design is at least worth consideration.  I wouldn't buy it in hardcover, but checking it out of the library or buying in paperback may well prove worth the time for the adventurous reader. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2004-12-21
US	48242885	RPBLIPMRMP6HW	1400078741	767591657	McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories	Books	5	34	35	N	Y	Tremendous collection of short stories	In his excellent introduction to \\"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories\\", Michael Chabon decries what one might call the \\"genre-fication\\" of modern literature.  He quite rightly points out that there is romance in the fantastic, science fiction in the literary, mystery in romance, etc., etc.  It is therefore the stated ambition of this collection to gather authors who would otherwise not be lined up side by side, in an effort to blur these distinctions of genre, and introduce the reader to new styles and authors.  I am glad to report that the result is spectacularly successful.  While there is no connection between the stories, the uniformly excellent writing and passion displayed by the contributors results in a collection of diverse entries that somehow works as a whole.    The collection begins with Margaret Atwood's \\"Lusus Naturae\\" which immediately captures the spirit of the book with a romantic/gothic/science fiction entry.  An ideal first piece, it sets the tone for the subsequent entries.  Next is the remarkable David Mitchell with \\"What You Do Not Know You Want\\"; a noir-ish mystery with a supernatural twist.  Readers of his recent \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will particularly enjoy this entry as it definitely echoes the themes and settings of that work.  Moreover, like Atwood's entry, this blurring of genres adds to the cohesiveness of the work as a whole.    Jonathan Lethem's \\"Vivian Relf\\" carries things forward with an enigmatic romance written in a literary style.  It is a classic short story, and a good change of pace which keeps the reader on their toes.  Next is \\"Minnow\\" by Ayelet Waldman which probably had more of an impact on me than any other stories.  It would be difficult to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but the themes surrounding parenthood are somehow both disturbing and reassuring at the same time.  \\"Zeroville\\" by Steve Erickson just might be my favorite entry.  His tale of a door hidden across the breadth of cinema, and just whatit means, is fascinating and perfectly executed.    In \\"Lisey in the Madman\\", Stephen King proves that he is still the master of scene setting; no one can make you feel the heat of a noonday sun like him.  However, this is also an interesting psychological/supernatural thriller, and if he does flesh it out into a novel (as is suggested) it could prove to be a remarkable work.  \\"7C\\" blends hard science fiction and romance in perhaps the most original entry in the book.  It's rare that quantum physics makes for exciting reading, but author Jason Roberts pulls it off nicely.    \\"The Miniaturist\\" by Heide Julavits is reminiscent of a \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode with all of the macabre scene setting and bizarre conclusion one would expect.  \\"The Child\\" by Roddy Doyle is an excellent companion piece as it has the same sort of feel, but the motivations are far more vague and the twist at the end definitely leaves open a host of interpretations.  \\"Delmonico\\" by Daniel Handler offers another nice change of pace in a fun little mystery that reads like a magic trick.    The next two entries are the only two that I have mixed feelings about.  Both \\"The Scheme of Things\\" by Charles D'Ambrosio and \\"The Devil of Delery Street\\" by Poppy Z. Brite are well written, but neither really got of the ground.  The first features superb scene setting and some fascinating characters, but the payoff was never really there, while the latter seemed to be building to a great conclusion, but ultimately fell flat in the end.  I should emphasize that neither contribution is \\"bad\\" by any stretch, but compared to the other entries they just don't measure up.    Fortunately, the next two entries are superb, and along with \\"Zeroville\\" make up my top three for the collection.  The first is what motivated me to buy the book in the first place, China Mieville's \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\".  As usual, he doesn't disappoint; while he maintains his thus far ubiquitous fascination with urban landscapes,he has once again gone in a totally unexpected direction that is reminiscent of Mark Danielewski's \\"House of Leaves\\", but entirely original.  Next is Joyce Carol Oates' amazing \\"The Fabled Lighthouse of Vina Del Mar\\".  The entire time I was reading it, I felt like I was reading a lost Edgar Alan Poe story, and sure enough on the last page the reader finds that the story is based upon the only surviving page of a lost Poe work.  I should emphasize that this should in no way detract from Oates' writing, as she pays tribute even as she writes a wildly original piece that has some echoes of Lovecraft as well.      Finally, Peter Straub's enigmatic \\"Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle\\" provides the perfect conclusion to this collection.  A nice touch is that following this entry is a brief biography/bibliography of each author for those who would like to further explore the contributors' work.    Generally speaking, one expects an ensemble collection to be a mixed bag, and one crossing numerous genres, even more so.  Gladly, Michael Chabon has produced in \\"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories\\" that is informally excellent even as it accomplishes in breathtaking fashion its goal of breaking down the barriers between genres.  This collection is a real treat for fans of short stories, and is definitely not to be missed.    Jake Mohlman	2004-12-08
US	48242885	R2PV63XQOWGEH9	0375507256	851412948	Cloud Atlas: A Novel	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Redefining the novel one book at a time	When David Mitchell burst upon the literary scene with his remarkable first novel, \\"Ghostwritten\\", it was clear that not only was he a great talent, but that he would redefine what constituted a novel.  With his fascinating interweaving of seemingly disparate tales he created a whole new view of the plotline.  With his follow-up, \\"Number9Dream\\" he moved in a different direction as he toyed with concepts of reality and time.  Now in his third novel, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" the reader is treated to a fusion of these elements as well as a more sophisticated layering of deeper themes. <br /> <br />In composition, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is at least superficially similar to \\"Ghostwritten\\" as, like the previous work, it is comprised of six largely disparate plotlines that nonetheless share subtle connections.  However, the similarities end there for several reasons.  The first is that each of the sub-stories in \\"Cloud Atlas\\" stands alone as a novella, whereas in \\"Ghostwritten\\" the different vignettes couldn't really be treated as discrete works.  Secondly, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" spans an enormous period of time, so the connections are far less tangible than they are in \\"Ghostwritten\\".  Finally, and most importantly, five of the six plotlines are chopped in half, so that the reader moves forward in time reading each halfway, then reading the entirety of the sixth, only to boomerang back through time to the eventual conclusion of the first piece. <br /> <br />If that sounds jarring or potentially confusing, it can be, but it is also necessary for the core focus of \\"Cloud Atlas\\", human progress, beliefs, and ultimately hope.  One has an expectation that as society advances it advances for the better, both in terms of human comfort and compassion.  However, Mitchell's cautionary writing reveals that \\"progress\\" is not easily defined, is not always for the best, but isn't entirely for the worst either.  From the nineteenth century South Pacific, to 1930's Belgium, to 1970's San Francisco to modern day England, to a 22nd or 23rd century Korean superpower and finally to a post-apocalyptic Hawaii of the distant future, Mitchell spins together a dizzying array of characters, themes and settings into this one overarching discussion. <br /> <br />As I mentioned above, it is perhaps most impressive that each section stands so successful on its own.  One might expect such an unorthodox book to be successful as a whole, but somewhat less polished when broken down into its constituent parts, but in the case of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" that is entirely untrue.  The tale of Adam Ewing reads exactly like a travelogue of the 1800's, replete with the style and worldview of the day.  Robert Frobisher's bleak post-World War I Belgium likewise captures the feel and literature of the day.  Luisa Rey's investigation into a 1970's nuclear power plant displays all of the noir-ish self-righteousness of post-Watergate fiction and Timothy Cavendish's misadventures beautifully sum up our rather self-absorbed era and the self created problems we bemoan.  However, it is the final two stories that are the most remarkable. <br /> <br />The first of these (the fifth overall) is \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\" which contains the first person recounting of the life and misadventures of a self-aware cloned servant in the Korean super-state.  Drawing heavily on Aldous Huxley and Philip K. Dick, Mitchell is able to explore some of the most powerful themes in science-fiction, while maintaining his own unique voice and perspective.  It is in this tale that the book's overarching theme of hope in the face of mankind's failings really begins to assert itself, all while offering a tale that is strongly reminiscent of Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" (a.k.a. \\"Blade Runner\\").  The second (the sixth, and only story told from start to finish) is the story of Zachry, who lives in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii of the distant future.  Clearly influenced by Russell Hoban's \\"Riddley Walker\\", Zachry recounts a life that is notall that different from that encountered by Adam Ewing in his journeys through the Pacific centuries before.  It is this symmetry that forms the foundation for the entire book, and which sets the tone for the second half of the book.  For in a world that seems destined to wind down, what is the point of resolution in all of the other plotlines? <br /> <br />Of course, that is what makes \\"Cloud Atlas\\" such a remarkable novel.  Because of Mitchell's presentation, he leaves open the question of whether time is malleable, or if there is but one path forward.  Perhaps the reversal in the book's second half indicates that the characters are changing their lives, and thus the future or it is possible that their actions echo through the past.  In a time when quantam physics seems to indicate that time is only a perception of entropy and that all \\"times\\" may be present at any given moment, the ramifications of Mitchell's approach are ultimately endless. <br /> <br />Somehow this open-ended interpretation seems appropriate for a book of such scope and ambition.  In \\"Cloud Atlas\\" David Mitchell continues to reshape what a novel is, and continues to challenge his readers even as he draws them in with deft writing and engaging plotlines.  Admittedly, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" can be a daunting novel to approach, but once the reader begins to pick up on the subtle connections and rhythms of the passing centuries, it is impossible to escape. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2004-11-30
US	48242885	R2059FPO4YAD01	0670894737	141542110	The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Thorough, well written and approachable scientific history	As one might expect, John M. Barry's \\"The Great Influenza\\" offers a thorough scientific review of the influenza virus that so ravaged the globe in 1918-19.  What makes it a truly superb history though, is it's comprehensive review of the surrounding international, cultural and political factors that made served to create a viral \\"perfect storm\\".  Moreover, he offers comprehensive biological profiles of all of the medical giants who strove mightily to combat a largely unknown opponent. <br /> <br />First and foremost, \\"The Great Influenza\\" is a scientific history, and as such, Barry offers a thorough introduction into the influenza virus, and the associated bio-chemistry of viral replication and transmission.  While some science background will make the material more approachable, Barry nonetheless has done an admirable job of presenting complex technical information in relatively straightforward language.  He goes on to review principles of epidemiology, and offers a fascinating review of the birth of scientific medicine in America. <br /> <br />However, the science that infuses the book is only the first step in understanding the nature and course of the pandemic.  Barry delves into the history of World War I at some length in order to explain how wartime censorship severely hampered the response to the growing threat.  The most obvious example of the impact of this censorship is reflected in the pandemic being referred to as the Spanish Flu; in reality the flu probably developed in Kansas, but as a neutral country, Spain's uncensored press was the first to openly report the disease, and hence a epidemiological red herring was created. <br /> <br />Likewise, he discusses how the political patronage of the Democratic political machines of the major Eastern cities resulted in massively incompetent public health officials.   When combined with packed living conditions, and the general squalor of many urban districts, influenza and associated secondary infections had free reign in places like Philadelphia and Boston.  Finally, wartime demands meant hundreds of thousands of men packed into poorly planned and constructed camps, which proved to be perfect incubators for disease.  This circumstance was further aggravated by the War Department's complete unwillingness to halt troop movements in the face of the disease, thereby spreading the virus through the body of the nation via railroad. <br /> <br />At the same time, Barry is highly effective in distilling the consequences of such a massive event.  Among other things, the virus decimated the combatants in France, and undoubtedly contributed to the end of World War I.  Moreover, it took its toll on the negotiators in Versailles, including Woodrow Wilson.  In fact, it may have so weakened Wilson that it contributed to his capitulation on the matter of reparations and war guilt, and Barry offers a fascinating argument that it may have contributed to his stroke a few months later. <br /> <br />Finally, Barry's discussion of the virus' impact and what it means for the modern world is nothing short of chilling.  While traditional estimates indicate a death toll of roughly twenty million, Barry offers a compelling argument that the death toll was at least fifty million, and possibly as high as one hundred million.  Perhaps even more grim, in some areas the infection rate was greater than 50%.  He then extrapolates that result to our vastly larger population (roughly 6 billion today as compared to 2 billion in 1918) and the results are terrifying: several hundred million dead, with vastly more stricken ill.  The consequences for modern society are dire, and it is almost certain that another influenza pandemic will strike again.  That said, Barry sees hope in the actions of the CDC, the WHO and similar organizations, although there are enormous obstacles to overcome. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is history as it should be written.  Barry has tackled a topic that is poorly understood, hadenormous long term consequences, and holds very clear relevance to us today.  He then goes on to present that subject in an approachable, thorough and engaging manner.  \\"The Great Influenza\\" is a remarkable and fascinating journey into one of the defining events of the 20th century and is among the best of recent historical writing. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2004-11-09
US	48242885	R2JXLRS4N3WRS3	0812967127	823106538	The Day of the Triffids (20th Century Rediscoveries)	Books	5	158	163	N	Y	Brilliant, and far too often overlooked	\\"The Day of the Triffids\\" by John Wyndham seems to be a forgotten child of the post-apocalyptic genre. I'm not sure if this is due to it's relatively unorthodox premise, or it's somewhat dated take on gender roles, but either reason is, frankly, dead wrong as this is an amazing book that ranks with \\"On the Beach\\" and \\"Alas, Babylon\\" as a cornerstone of the genre.  With a premise that is both utterly unique and rich in metaphor, and characters that are charged with emotion, it is a truly gripping read. <br /> <br />What sets \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" apart from other books in the genre is its two tiered approach to the end of the world.  The first revolves around the eponymous Triffids, which are mobile, semi-carnivorous plants which are presumed to be the result of Soviet genetic tampering.  While one would expect that they would be treated as a scourge, quite the opposite occurs as mankind farms them for the rich oils they produce.  Thus, is the hubris of man framed quite nicely, and the pieces put in play. <br /> <br />For the triffids are only benign so long as man can control them; when left to their own devices they grow an intensely venomous lash that can kill a full grown human.  When a bizarre stellar event leaves everyone who witnessed it blind, the time of the triffids is suddenly at hand.  To go further would risk spoiling the plot, but as the few sighted survivors struggle to make sense of, and survive in, their greatly altered world, the triffids become the foremost obstacle to their continued existence. <br /> <br />Thus, \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" stands quite nicely as a post-apocalyptic thriller.  However, it is what is going on between the lines that makes this a classic.  First is the obvious comparison between the triffids and the Soviets.  Not only did the latter create the former, but the swarming, relentless approach of the triffids nicely mirrors the Western view of Soviet expansions in the 1950's.  However, unlike many Cold War era authors, Wyndham's view of the world is not entirely black and white.  While the Soviet system may be the enemy, and not one he wants to live under, he doesn't remove all blame from the West.  By their very response to Soviet moves he sees a world made less, not more safe, and one that is walking a knife's edge over the abyss. <br /> <br />Ultimately though, he sees hope for mankind because even as it teeters on the brink of extinction, he anticipates the ability to learn and grow from the mistakes of the past.  His rather prescient views of the use of space and bio-technology offer hope, but only if used responsibly, and therefore \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" is as much a cautionary tale, somewhat in the vein of a \\"Jurassic Park\\", as it is a post-apocalyptic thriller. <br /> <br />Finally, there is a small but very noticeably element that infuses much of the first half of the novel.  Time and again, Wyndham has his characters assuming that the Americans will be along by and by to sort things out.  Given that this novel was published in 1951 on the heels of World War II, one has to assume that Wyndham was warning his fellow countrymen that the Americans weren't going to be around forever, so they better start standing on their own two feet.  While hardly essential to the plot, this historical artifact does offer interesting insight into the context of the book. <br /> <br />Finally, as I alluded to above, there is definitely a pervasive, but largely benign note of sexism in \\"The Day of the Triffids\\".  While it may offend some, it is by no means misogynistic, and rather reflects a form of chivalry that was probably outdated even as Wyndham wrote the book.  On some level he seems to recognize this, as his writing of female characters is somewhat conflicted; he wants to shelter them even as he knows they must be strong.  Again, more than anything this offers an interesting historical context to the novel. <br /> <br />I should also add that the introduction by Edmund Morris is superb, as he does an excellent job of stating why \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" is still relevant, and perhaps more pertinent than ever in our post-9/11 world.  He writes particularly strongly of Wyndham's pathos for the victims, and how it mirrors our own response to terrorism.  The rare novel that offers both gripping narrative and thoughtful commentary, \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" represents post-apocalyptic literature at its best and should rightly be held among the best contributions to the genre. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2004-09-14
US	48242885	R1I11ZPTO1ACSX	1587760290	529978447	Some Will Not Die	Books	2	50	58	N	Y	A few interesting ideas, but riddled with problems	There are many problems with Algis Budrys' \\"Some Will Not Die\\" but first and foremost is that the author doesn't seem to be at all sure what it is he wants to write.  At some times, Budrys is writing a sort of \\"future history\\", at others a political thriller, and still others a rather mundane post-apocalyptic thriller.  While the last of these is the primary genre in which one would place the book, the lack of focus results in a thoroughly disjointed novel.    It begins conventionally enough (following a prologue set some years later) with a super-plague, possibly developed by one of the competing parties of the Cold War, tearing through the U.S. and presumably, the rest of the world.  The reader follows the path of Matt Garvin, a young survivor who strives to make a life for himself in an emptied on Manhattan.  As the book progresses, the reader is offered glimpses of various stages of Matt and his family's life, alternating with the plot line from the prologue.  Unfortunately, this approach in a fairly short novel leads to a pronounced lack of character development and plot twists that seem almost random.  Moreover, there is only the vaguest connection between the prologue and the main body of the text, which makes for jarring transitions.    To his credit, Budrys does introduce some interesting theories regarding the development of civilization and the allocation of labor, but they are rarely well integrated into the plot, and therefore come across more like lecturing than story telling.  Finally, the conclusions of both sections are so overwrought as to be almost laughable.    Ultimately, this isn't a terrible book, but it's not a very good one either.  The character development is weak, and breaks off just when it is getting interesting.  In addition, there is no unifying theme to the work, and finally, the book is riddled with typos.  If you are a big fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, it may be worth reading if for no other reason than its premise is largely believable, which is rare in a genre riddled with absurdity.  If you are indifferent to post-apocalyptic fiction, I would pass on \\"Some Will Not Die\\" as it doesn't have anything to offer when removed from the context of the genre.    Jake Mohlman	2004-09-09
US	48242885	R3BU5HTEYVVWTO	044653143X	960521744	Brimstone (Pendergast, Book 5)	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Back to form	After a somewhat disappointing \\"Still Life with Crows\\" I approached \\"Brimstone\\" with a bit of trepidation.  I was worried that Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child may have lost their knack for coming up with original plots in a genre that trends towards the mediocre.  Moreover, I was afraid that they had wrung all they could out of their signature character, Special Agent Pendergast, leaving him a rather boring clich&eacute;.  Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth as \\"Brimstone\\" is their strongest novel since \\"The Ice Limit\\".  Infused with a darker edge, and a palpable spirit of malevolence, that is quite successfully maintained throughout the numerous plot twists, \\"Brimstone\\" is a genuinely superb thriller.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, \\"Brimstone\\" once again finds Pendergast investigating a murder that seems tied to the occult.  Specifically, he is investigating the bizarre death of art critic Jeremy Grove, who has been found burned to death in a room untouched by fire.  Adding to the mystery is the overpowering stench of sulfur and what appears to be a cloven hoof burned into the floor.  To assist in his investigation, Pendergast calls upon Vincent D'Agosta, previously seen in \\"Relic\\" and \\"Reliquary\\", who has been languishing in the Southampton Police Department after an abortive turn as a novelist.  As more victims fall prey to the seemingly demonic killer, and as the public begins to see the murders as Scripture fulfilled, the two investigators race against the clock to solve Preston and Child's most puzzling mystery yet.<br /><br />That stated, what makes \\"Brimstone\\" so successful is that Preston and Child manage to weave in a much larger set of plot lines, characters and settings than usual.  Whereas in \\"Still Life with Crows\\" the question of Pendergast's ward, Constance, was blatantly tacked on in a form of in novel advertising, in \\"Brimstone\\" she actually has a role to play and fits much better within the structure of the book.  Likewise, even though the supernatural thriller element is always paramount, the authors are quite successful in blending in elements of espionage, international assassins and history, the result of which is perhaps their richest, most complex novel to date.  Finally, a significant portion of the action takes place overseas, which creates an intriguing dichotomy of Pendergast being more in his element culturally, but significantly weakened for not being on his home turf.<br /><br />Furthermore, Lincoln and Child gleefully (but entirely respectfully) draw upon their literary heroes such as Poe and Lovecraft.  The result is a novel that has much of the style and menace of these two authors, while incorporating the genuinely fresh take that one expects from these two authors.  As such, I can wholeheartedly endorse \\"Brimstone\\" as a superb return to form for Preston and Child.  It is perhaps their darkest novel to date, and infuses the character of Pendergast with new life, and more importantly, new mysteries.  For loyal readers, some questions will be resolved, but far more will be left unanswered, as what one might call the \\"Pendergast Mythos\\" continues to evolve.  \\"Brimstone\\" has vaulted to the top of my list for Preston and Child novels (just below the trinity of \\"Relic\\", \\"Riptide\\" and \\"Thunderhead\\") and is by far the best Pendergast novel since \\"Relic\\".  A real treat for the upcoming fall season, and especially Halloween, don't pass this one by.<br /><br />Jake Mohlman	2004-09-01
US	48242885	R2MGHDJIH1AZU3	0441011608	735608031	Strange Cargo	Books	4	16	17	N	Y	Generally strong novel; somewhat disappointing finish	Since the internet is such a visual medium, I feel it is only fair to begin this review with the following statement: the cover art for \\"Strange Cargo\\" has no relation to the text, so save yourself the time of flipping back and forth.  With that rather puzzling reminder that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover set aside, I can say that in this his third novel, Jeffrey Barlough continues to delight with his original fusion of genres.  For those unfamiliar with his prior work, Barlough has imagined a world of that primarily combines alternate history and apocalyptic fiction, the first element being the survival of Ice Age mega-fauna, and the latter being the destruction of the majority of civilization in an enigmatic, but massive, disaster some two hundred years before the period of his novels.  On top of this fusion, Barlough then piles on a host of other genres and styles to create genuinely unique novels. <br /> <br />In particular, Barlough has drawn heavily in style from Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle, with a vast panoply of characters, all with wonderful names like Thistlewood and Matchless, and all using a delightfully Victorian mode of speech.  In addition, Barlough has always, and has so particularly in \\"Strange Cargo\\", drawn on the \\"weird fiction\\" tradition of H. P. Lovecraft.  Hence, not only is this an apocalyptic alternate history, but is one that is populated by mysterious, and entirely capricious creatures far beyond human comprehension. <br /> <br />As one might imagine, there is a lot going on in \\"Strange Cargo\\", and it is in fact far more ambitious in its scope than \\"Dark Sleeper\\" or \\"The House in the High Woods\\".  This is due to primarily to the two distinct plot lines, as compared to the more narrow focus of the prior two novels.  To attempt to explain the plot in any detail would risk major spoilers, but in a general sense, the novel revolves around a mystery dating back to Ancient Greece, and touches upon questions of theology and free will.At the same time, the second, parallel story is a more straightforward detective/ghost story. <br /> <br />For the most part, Barlough handles his different characters and plots quite deftly.  His skill as a writer has improved significantly, and when combined with his gift for dialogue and characterization, the reader is treated to a novel that is both lush and brisk at the same time.  In particular, his examination of the dynamics of human relationships is very nicely handled and is the heart which supports the weighty body of his creation. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I cannot offer an entirely unreserved endorsement, as the conclusion is somewhat lacking.  Without giving anything away, the main plot line ends in a manner that is rushed, generally unsatisfying, and far too convenient within the context of the novel.  At the same time, the second plot line ends in rather a more satisfying a fashion, except that it never ties back to the main plot.  One could completely excise this second element from the novel without any impact on the primary story, and one is thus left wondering what the point of it was.  Finally, the apocalyptic element of Barlough's novels has always been highly enigmatic; no one quite new what had happened.  In \\"Strange Cargo\\", Barlough more or less reveals the cause of \\"The Sundering\\" and as such, I feel that much of the mystery has been drained from his books.  Again, if one cut out the explanation, the story would carry on just as well, and with more room for the reader's imagination to come into play. <br /> <br />That said, \\"Strange Cargo\\" is still well worth reading if for no other reason than Barlough represents one of the most original voices in fiction today.  While perhaps not of the caliber of a Mieville or a Vandermeer, he has nonetheless used a fascinating blend of genres and an original voice to write a novel that is both familiar and fresh at the same time.  I would rate \\"Dark Sleeper\\" and \\"The House in the High Woods\\" ahead of\\"Strange Cargo\\", but they are two of my favorite novels of the last five years, and as such, placing third is hardly a bad thing. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />	2004-08-29
US	48242885	R117LTUZNKO4E3	0345464028	579397011	Iron Council	Books	5	99	110	N	N	Another engaging, challenging read from a remarkable talent	First off, for those of you new to China Mieville, I would recommend that you begin with \\"Perdido Street Station\\" (or \\"King Rat\\"), followed up by \\"The Scar\\", and only then tackle \\"Iron Council\\".  While the three books don't form a trilogy in the traditional sense, they nonetheless draw on shared themes and a common setting and history.  As such, while \\"Iron Council\\" can certainly be read and appreciated by a newcomer to Mieville's writing, there are numerous small references and commonalities that will be missed.    Fans of Mieville, however, will find in \\"Iron Council\\" perhaps his most nuanced and sophisticated writing to date.  As usual, the author defies genres, and has produced what would best be described (if one was forced to use labels) as a gothic-western-political-thriller.  At the same time, he continues to subvert traditional fantasy elements as well as co-opting elements from other traditions and grounding them in his reality.  However, Mieville has also tackled a more challenging structural approach in this novel, as he uses three different voices and two time periods that, while connected by plot threads are separated by decades.  Furthermore, the chronologically earlier section comes 130 pages into the book, which in the hands of a less gifted writer would be horribly jarring, but which Mieville pulls of with style.    The primary story (which is elaborated upon by the flashback) is set some twenty years after the events of Perdido Street Station, and finds New Crobuzon at war with distant Tesh, with discontent at home mounting as the casualties mount and the economy falters.  It is a time of turmoil and political dissent bordering on civil war; as options are weighed, one man, Judah Low, goes in search of a near mythical construct whose time may be at hand, Iron Council.  To say more would risk severe spoilers, but the real joy of \\"Iron Council\\" is that the plot is served so deftly by the underlying themes, and vice versa.    And those themes are legion, the most obvious one being New Crobuzon's war with Tesh as a parallel with the Iraq war.  Likewise, there are economic factors that are akin to the bursting of the .com bubble of the late 1990's.  However, Mieville has made it abundantly clear in numerous interviews that he has no interest in spreading his political views (he is a Socialist who has run for Parliament) through his writing, and that holds true here.  Rather, these elements serve to ground the story in a believable reality, which allows the reader to accept at face value the fantastic elements.  Moreover, even as he subverts everything that is a \\"norm\\" of fantasy, Mieville also casts his own views in a realisitic light.  For example, the political activists (with whom he obviously sympathizes) frequently make capricious, even brutal decisions, and display very un-liberal traits such as disdain for homosexuals.    However, as I said, these groundings are mere jumping off points for a much more intriguing exploration, for at its heart \\"Iron Council\\" is an exploration of change/history.  The groundwork for this is laid in Judah's ability to create golems, which Mieville describes as an intervention, a decision to change the un-living to living.  Once the reader recognizes this metaphor, Mieville's intent becomes clear as he considers industry, politics and war (among other things) as interventions into the status quo, as forces for change.  In so doing, Mieville quite rightly takes a long view of history in which right and wrong become blurred by the law of unintended consequences.  There is a symmetry in his world, almost karmic in its nature, in which actions in the past rebound in unexpected ways in the present.  The driving force of history for Mieville is the individual, but as such, he recognizes the fundamental instability this introduces into his novel.  People change, there motivations change, and as such, tipping points can never be quite predicted, and will often radically diverge from theexpected path.      Which brings me to one of the most intriguing structures in the book, that of the quest.  In traditional fantasy, characters will generally band together for a come purpose, and face adversity from outside of the group.  Their internal dynamic is largely fixed, and their motivations are common.  Mieville, on the other hand, has described two quests in which each character's motivations are different, are often hidden, and sometimes at odds within the group.  This far more realistic approach allows him not only to paint a more reasonable view of historical change as described above, but also to consider the power of \\"truth\\" as a motivation for said change.  Mieville argues that sometimes a myth or a symbol can be more powerful than the truth.  However, there is a danger in myths because they can be twisted to mask one's real motivations.  Movements for revolutionary change, and one need look no further than the French Revolution, often become dressing for personal vendettas.    Finally, Mieville takes these two intertwined threads, intervention and truth, to ask an ultimate question: can one work for change even as one despises the mechanism of said change.  For example, is murder acceptable if it serves a greater good?  Or does change always pervert the purest motivations and draw them closer to that which is being rebelled against, in form if not in ideology? Does hating war mean wanting your country to lose?    In conclusion, if I have created the impression that \\"Iron Council\\" is nothing by dry philosophizing, I must apologize as nothing could be further from truth.  First and foremost, \\"Iron Council\\" is an adventure story set in a world that for all it's bizarre and beautifully realized detail is nonetheless disturbingly familiar.  However, Mieville is such a gifted writer, who pours so many ideas into his work, even the most literal reader will find themselves drawn into the undercurrents which suffuse the novel.  \\"Iron Council\\" is anotherbrilliant contribution from a remarkable talent, and I strongly recommend reveling in it.

US	48242885	R3RR4Q22ACYYKW	0765307219	967782385	Behemoth: B-Max	Books	5	24	24	N	Y	The best so far!	Before I can review the content of Peter Watts' \\"Behemoth: B-Max\\" there are two facts I need to mention.  The first is that it represents the third book of a trilogy, and I would strongly recommend one tackle the first two volumes (\\"Starfish\\" and \\"Maelstrom\\") before reading this one.  The second is that \\"Behemoth\\" should be one six hundred page book, but because of trends in the publishing industry it's being published as two separate volumes.  The author is completely forthright about this fact, and I believe him when he says that this was not his preferred method of publication.  Because of this approach, precious little is resolved in this first volume; so if you aren't a fan of cliff hangers, you might want to wait until \\"Behemoth: Seppuku\\" is published in late 2004/early 2005 to read this volume.<br />For those of you who are new to the series, here is a brief synopsis that should tell you whether or not these books are for you.  Essentially, the story arc is about evolution: human, animal and electronic.  By mixing a blend of biology, computer science and chaos theory, Watts has created a near future Earth where man is simultaneously at the height of his powers and walking the knife's edge of total ecological failure.  In an effort to maintain the high standard of Western living mankind has turned to deep sea geothermal power to meet their energy needs.  Miles below the ocean, specially engineered humans culled from the dregs of society maintain these power plants.  However, what no one could have expected was that they would encounter an organism that would unleash an apocalypse.  Part hard science-fiction, part post-apocalyptic, the first two books represent a genuinely original voice in the genre.<br />All that said, \\"Behemoth\\" represents another superb piece of writing by Watts; it contains all the tension and fascinating science of the earlier volumes, but also displays his increasing talent.  The structure of the book is more sophisticated and subtle than the previous volumes, and I say this not to criticize the earlier books, but to highlight the strengths of this one.  <br />Set five years after the events of \\"Maelstrom\\", \\"Behemoth\\" finds the remaining rifters and the surviving North American elite living in an uneasy truce on the floor of the Atlantic.  Presumably safe from the disease that is ravaging the rest of the world, they have managed to come to an accommodation that allows everyone to live and let live.  Foremost among the rifters are Lubin, the one time spy, and Lenie Clarke, the Meltdown Madonna herself.  Opposite them is Patricia Rowan, their one time nemesis and sometime ally.  Alone, they might have formed a shifting but stable triangle; however, their constituents, particularly the more militant rifters, force a situation that is never far from open warfare.  This dichotomy is beautifully executed by Watts, and represents a shift in his approach.  Where much of the tension in the prior two books was environmental, in \\"Behemoth\\" he has created a human drama that surpasses its astonishing location.<br />In contrast from the fragile existence on the ocean floor, the reader is presented with the contrast of Achilles Desjardins, the human god who fights chaos for the CSIRA.  While occupying perhaps only a third of the book, these chapters are the most powerful.  Consisting only of Achilles' thoughts, history and worldview, they paint a comprehensive portrait of one of the most powerful men on Earth.  Perhaps most remarkable is that Watts makes him despicable and sympathetic at the same time, all while keeping him something of an enigma.  <br />Given the fact that this is the third book of a trilogy, and further given the split nature of the title, any more attempts at a plot summary would risk grave spoilers.  Simply put, it is science fiction as it should be written.  Watts uses his setting as a means to consider our slow suicide as a species in the form of ecological decay, and the complex, and ultimately unknowable workings of the mind.  He separates himself from much of what is on the market by injecting humanity and pathos into his writing; his world, no matter how brilliantly conceived and executed, is a means to a greater end.  This stands in stark contrast to other \\"hard\\" SF novels which exist solely to cram technical information into a fictional setting while ignoring such fundamentals as plot and characterization.<br />What is perhaps most engaging about Watts' books is that he has made the mundane unique and terrifying.  No one gives much though to the web as an environment, but he sees an electronic landscape filled with predators and prey.  Most of us think of the ocean as the beach, but Watts reveals a world every bit as alien as the surface of another planet.  Finally, his attention to detail is superb, without being overwhelming.  Watts' world is replete with history, but much of it is only alluded to; this creates a world that is weighed down by history, and a novel that isn't.  An excellent example of this detail is his web site.  I can't post the URL here, but a simple web search will turn it up.  There one can find mountains of what one might call \\"side-story\\" it doesn't fill in any gaps per se, but it does further flesh out the Earth of the 2050's.<br />If you're a fan, a probably have said more than I needed to to sell you on this book.  However, if you are new to the series, I hope I have managed to pass on the incredible originality and superb writing Watts has to offer.  This is a trilogy that is unique in my experience, and \\"Behemoth\\" represents the best contribution thus far.  This is definitely not one to be missed.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-06-26
US	48242885	RHDV4740NMRNC	1930846274	286569381	Secret Life	Books	5	20	22	N	Y	Breathtaking glimpse into a remarkable imagination	There are many things that are remarkable about Jeff VanderMeer's newest collection \\"Secret Life\\", but what is perhaps most remarkable is how in spite of a host of different subjects and thematic approaches, it still fits together as a whole.  What exactly that \\"whole\\" is is open to question, but whatever it is, it certainly represents arguably the most unique, and certainly one of the most exciting, voices in fiction today.  <br />Actually, it should come as no surprise that VanderMeer can weave so many disparate parts into something comprehensive; while there may be writers with more innate talent, I find it hard to believe that any author is more dedicated to the actual craft of writing.  This comes through not only in the insightful endnotes that accompany each story, but also in writing that has plainly been pored over and molded to perfection, much like the mantle being chipped away from a gemstone to reveal the hard, perfect core.<br />With twenty-one stories that are not directly (but certainly thematically) linked, it would be difficult to review \\"Secret Life\\" in its entirety in the space available.  Instead, a few general comments, and then some brief comments on a few of the best pieces.  First, for those readers who have already encountered VanderMeer's other work, this volume will be a particular treat.  Both Ambergris and the world from \\"Veniss Underground\\" are heavily represented, but what makes these stories particularly intriguing is that they represent various stages in each world's evolution.  For example, \\"Learning to Leave the Flesh\\" is set in an Ambergris, but it is not the Ambergris which so delighted readers in \\"City of Saints and Madmen\\".  There are familiar elements, but it is much more like our own world the baroque marvel that it becomes.  Conversely, \\"Corpse Mouth and Spore Nose\\" contain very familiar Ambergris elements, but seems to be set long after the era of \\"City of Saints and Madmen\\".<br />Even more provoking is the development ofthe Veniss world.  The first, \\"The Sea, Mendeho, and Moonlight\\" was written when VanderMeer was only seventeen, which is impressive.  However, it is only when this story is bumped up against \\"Balzac's War\\" which happens hundreds, over even thousands, of years later, can the true breadth of VanderMeer's creative vision be realized.  There are also several stories written in the second person, which, while the author never specifically mentions it, must of have contributed immensely to his ability to write the perfectly executed second section of \\"Veniss Underground\\".<br />As for specific stories, there are those who may think this is a cop out, but the best was probably the title piece, \\"Secret Life\\".  Set in an office building that is a world unto itself, the story is perhaps most engaging for how it makes the mundane seem bizarre and new.  Moreover, layered over this bustling little world is the author's characteristic wit, poking fun at the absurdity of the modern workplace, while not being so condescending as to deny it's not something we all need to do.  Ultimately, it's a story about seeing the remarkable in everyday things and is probably the best executed of all the pieces.<br />\\"The Bone Carver's Tale\\" is another beautiful piece, which is in a way ironic since it deals with the nature of beauty, as seen through the eyes of a bone carver (surprise, surprise) during a time of war in Southeast Asia.  \\"The General Who is Dead\\" and \\"London Burning\\" are both interesting looks at the ultimate futility of war.  While both are brief, they are notable in that the imagery they use is simple without being hackneyed and absolute without being preachy.  Finally, there is \\"Mansions of the Moon (A Cautionary Tale)\\" which in setting is very reminscent of H. P. Lovecraft, but in style somehow similar to H. G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\".  If I had to pick one story for VanderMeer to develop into a novel, it would probably be this one just because it is so distinct from his other work.<br />I could go on, but I fear my enthusiasm would risk spoiling the stories for others, particularly when it comes to the Ambergris and Veniss pieces.  \\"Secret Life\\" will thrill VanderMeer fans even as it ensnares new readers with his utterly unique perspectives (not to mention the dazzling cover art).  Moreover, even as \\"Secret Life\\" gives a look into VanderMeer's development as a writer, it also offers glimpses of what is to come, including a stand alone (the author's words) excerpt from his recently completed (but not yet published) novel \\"Shriek: An Afterword\\". Whether a true champion of the New Weird (if one must classify in genres) or a neophyte, \\"Secret Life\\" is another treat from one of the most exciting voices in fiction today.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-06-11
US	48242885	R1L69PJPN1RLM7	0316835145	295425783	Skeletons on the Zahara: A True Story of Survival	Books	4	14	16	N	N	Fascinating tale of survival	\\"Skeletons on the Zahara\\" by Dean King reflects a recent trend in history writing towards more personal, localized discussions of history.  Books like \\"Twelve Days of Terror\\", \\"The Devil in the White City\\" and \\"Krakatoa\\" taken events that were enormously important when they occurred, but which have, over time, faded into vague remembrance.  By looking at these forgotten events, the author has an opportunity to not only tell and original story, but also reflect upon the era as a whole, and draw conclusions about how it shaped, and was shaped by, the event in question.<br />Handled poorly, this approach can feel severely contrived, as the writer attempts to shoehorn a host of effects into his ill-fitting cause.  However, when done successfully, as is the case with \\"Skeletons on the Zahara\\", the author brings a unique perspective to the period, while engaging the reader with new adventures.  In fact, if nothing else, this is an adventure story, detailing the appalling and yet somehow inspiring story of sailors shipwrecked on the North African coast and captured into slavery.<br />King sets the stage, by explaining the disastrous consequences the War of 1812 had on the commercial shipping industry in New England, and how limited prospects on land and potentially rich rewards at sea drove men to a life of danger and separation from their families.  Offering personal glimpses into the lives of Captain James Riley and his crew, he paints a portrait of ambitious men, living life on the edge between prosperity and destitution.  At the same, he offers a glimpse into the life of a merchant on the Sahara, where not just material wealth but life and health itself is determined by the desert's fickle and unrelentingly brutal conditions.  By juxtaposing lifestyles that couldn't be more different except of their common precariousness, the author nicely sets the stage for the clash of cultures to come.<br />When Riley wrecks along the coast of Africa he and his crew find themselvesin a world as alien as that of another planet.  As they are placed into bondage, there world is literally turned upside down; as white New Englanders they may not have been pro-slavery, but they certainly never anticipated being held in servitude to Africans.  Over the following months, Riley, in a remarkable display of leadership and loyalty to his crew manages to wheedle, cajole and bluff their way to salvation even as they suffer horrendously at the hands of their captors and the elements.<br />While the story of survival is remarkable in and of itself, the glimpse King offers into a time and place most modern American's are entirely familiar with is fascinating.  Operating within a clan based feudal system, North Africa in the early nineteenth century was a place of shifting, capricious alliances, where attention to personal survival and aggrandizement were crucial.  Although he couldn't have been aware of the labyrinthine political systems he was ensnared in, Riley and his crew on more than one occasion almost sparked open war.<br />However, it is in placing Riley's narrative within the larger historical context that King's book truly shines.  While the aforementioned aspect of slavery is paramount, \\"Skeletons of the Zahara\\" also offers insight for our own age.  Even as America struggles to understand the Arab mind, King offers at least a glimpse into a culture that is fundamentally different, but not necessarily at odds with, our own.  The compassion shown by numerous Arabs to the sailors outstrips the brutal culture in which they operate.  This common humanity touched Riley deeply, and made him a crusader for abolitionism for the rest of his life.  There is no reason to think this humanity has eroded over the years, and King obliquely argues that it can become the basis for a new understanding with Islamic culture today.<br />Part adventure story, part history, part social commentary, \\"Skeletons of the Zahara\\" breaths new life into a forgotten tale of survival.  Given that Riley's narrative helped shaped the minds of such luminaries as Abraham Lincoln and Henry David Thoreau, it is worth reading in its own right, but when coupled with King's historical analysis it rises to a different level.  While sometimes presumptuous in his narrative, King has nevertheless produced a book that highlights cooperation and commonality across cultures at a time when such elements are sorely lacking.  The author, while primarily interested in telling a fascinating story of survival, is also able to offer precedent for mutually beneficial interaction between American and Islam.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-06-01

While his account often drifts far afield of the title material, he has a knack for always finding his way back to the topic at hand.   Which is a good thing because that topic, the largest explosion ever recorded by modern man and one that was responsible for the death of 36,000 people, is more than ample material for any book's purview.<br />What makes Winchester's writing appealing is that he uses the more conversational narrative style that has become the preferred approach in popular history and science today; one might call in the Stephen Ambrose Effect.  Winchester largely paints his story with a broad brush (albeit across a host of topics), and as such, those who may be intimidated by science writing shouldn't avoid \\"Krakatoa\\".  While the author does delve into a large variety of scientific disciplines, he is at heart a teacher, and the passion he has for the subject matter comes through as he strips down potentially complicated subjects to their basic elements.<br />That said, Winchester by no means \\"dumbs down\\" his material.  His explanation of the geological pressures that created and ultimately lead to the demise of Krakatoa are comprehensive and detailed.  Rather, he presents this material in a manner that is approachable for those without much of a scientific background, without detracting from it intellectually.  As such, those (like myself) who are more disposed to a scientific bent should be no more discouraged from reading \\"Krakatoa\\" than those who are not.  Winchester has basically laid out an intellectual smorgasbord and leaves it for the reader to determine how much they will consume.  The beauty of the \\"Krakatoa\\" (much like Robert Zubrin's on space exploration) is that the reader can skim the heavier science without losing the narrative flow.<br />What makes the book most appealing, though, is how Winchester vividly describes the eruption and then most importantly places it within a historical context.  This seems to be the area where some readers have felt he bogged down, but his descriptions of the region, its fauna and peoples, including a detailed consideration of Dutch colonial rule, provide critical information for understanding the scope and impact of the disaster.  In particular, his descriptions of the impact of the eruption on the rise of a more militant brand of Islam in Indonesia were particularly engaging, and eminently logical in spite of the seeming stretch.<br />Moreover, this historical element accomplishes two things.  The first is to put a human face on the tragedy: with 36,000 victims it is easy to lose one's frame of reference for the scale of the tragedy and suffering.  By including individual stories, including background, Winchester is able to humanize what otherwise has the potential to be a statistic.  The second is that it allows Winchester to explore the eruption not just as an event, but as a catalyst for the scientific community that had a host of long term impacts.  Thus, the massive shockwaves and wave effects are again removed from scientific the realm of scientific arcana and grounded in what they meant to a community barely on the cusp of understanding the world around them.<br />\\"Krakatoa\\" is an eminently readable and thoroughly enjoyable account of a well known but little understood place and time.  Winchester wanders through a host of different scientific disciplines and historical periods, and to be fair, there are probably those who will find this off-putting.  However, if the idea of a book that explores biology, geology, politics and history all while detailing one of the most spectacular natural events the world has ever seen appeals to you, \\"Krakatoa\\" is definitely right up your alley.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-05-04

Normally, when a person reviews a book, they aren't actually reviewing \\"the book\\" but the ideas contained therein.  And normally, such a semantic quibble would be absurd, but in the case of \\"The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases\\" it holds some merit.  Because not only does it contain a fascinating selection of the bizarre from a remarkably talented group of authors, but it compiles their writings in a visually stunning collection that beautifully mimics the style, and rather drolly the content, of a Victorian Era monograph.    The basic premise of the Guide is that it is the long running publication of the eponymous Dr. Lambshead, who specializes in bizarre diseases.  Moreover, the esteemed Dr. Lambshead is 102 years old, and his guide focuses on diseases that are, shall we say, beyond the pale of modern medicine.  From Bone Leprosy to Wife Blindness there isn't an eccentric or discredited disease uncovered by such medical luminaries as Jeff Vandermeer, Paul Di Fillipo, China Mieville and K. J. Bishop (to name a few).    The book begins with two introductions, one from Lambshead and one from the editors, both of which are hilarious.  The book concludes with entries from past guides, as well as remembrances from Lambshead's associates, a history of the guide and biographies of each of the contributors (in doctor manifestation, of course).  However, the obvious reason to read the Guide is the meat between these two pieces of bread: the diseases.  Each author spends anywhere from two to four pages detailing the history, cause and treatment of their own particular disease.      It would be impossible to consider each contribution here, and would spoil the fun of the book for other readers, but there are a few highlights worth mentioning just to offer the flavor of the Guide.  First up is Michael Barry's \\"Ballistic Organ Syndrome\\" which should be self-explanatory, and which nicely sets the tone for the rest of the Guide.  China Mieville's \\"Buscard's Murrain\\" is the first (and best) of several literary, or word based, diseases; it's characterized by his dry wit and excellent use of language and tone. Michael Cisco's \\"Clear Rice Syndrome\\" has an almost Lovecraft-ian feel, and is one of several contributions that could easily be fleshed out into something longer.  John Coulthart's \\"Printer's Evil\\" is cleverly placed within historical context and is superbly printed (more on this later).  Finally, there is \\"Tian Shan-Gobi Assimilation\\" by Jeff Vandermeer; not only is it another disease that could easily turn into something bigger, but it echoes numerous themes in his Ambergris work (without explicitly tying back to them) and will thus be a particular treat for fans of his work.  These are just a few of the many great contributions to the Guide, and my failure to mention others shouldn't be treated as an indictment, but rather as an acknowledgement of the consistently high standard of writing displayed throughout the guide.    As one can discern, the writing more than justifies the purchase price of the Guide, but what clinches it is the superb quality of the presentation.  Liberal use is made of different fonts to denote different periods in the Guide's history, and occasionally (as in the case of the aforementioned \\"Printer's Evil\\") to lend a period effect to a given disease.  However, the superb illustrations are what set the guide apart.  First, each disease is provided with an illustration, in the style of an 18th century illustrated book or newspaper (or the Wall Street Journal today).  Some are grotesque, some hilariously subtle, but they all nicely capture the disease in one snapshot.  Secondly, there are photographs of \\"old\\" copies of the guide and various locations and personalities, all of which are beautifully presented such that they actually look like a sixty year old book or a team of doctors working to contain a vicious outbreak of venereal disease or what have you.    Finally, the editors brought a real sense of historical weight to the Guide by creating \\"characters\\" and texts that appear repeatedly throughout the Guide.  Not only does this link together what would otherwise be largely unrelated vignettes, but it also deepens the satire by creating a comprehensive sense of realism around an entirely absurd creation.    Clever in its conception and execution, contributed to by an astonishingly talented pool of authors, and beautifully produced, \\"The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric and Discredited Diseases\\" is an absolute joy to read and a must have for anyone who appreciates books as works of art.  Its mind-bending amalgam of genres and influences is all the more intriguing for their smooth integration into one truly original work; the Guide was an enormously ambitious project that the contributors, and especially the editors, pulled off in spades.    Enjoy!    Jake Mohlman	2004-04-21

This can be especially true in regard to the wars of Israel because there is such an intense emotion surrounding them.  Happily, Abraham Rabinovich has avoided both of these problems with his masterful \\"The Yom Kippur War\\".  Moreover, he succeeds admirably in placing the war with in the broader context of the region and the times.<br />What makes \\"The Yom Kippur War\\" so successful is that Rabinovich captures and dissects all of the elements necessary to look at the war not just as a series of battles, but as a subject worthy of historical study.  These might be described as the prologue, the war itself (battles, casualties, personalities, etc.), battlefield innovation (tactics and weapons), geopolitics and historical perspective.  Alone, each area is well researched and written, combined they form one of the most effective and impressive military histories one is likely to encounter.<br />By defining the Yom Kippur War as a product of numerous clashes dating back to Israel's founding, Rabinovich transcends a simple narrative of events and forces the reader to consider the root causes of the conflict, and how those causes dictated its course.  One simple example is how Israel's stunning victory in The Six Day War lead to an institutional arrogance that meant they started the war poorly deployed and with limited ability to improvise in its early days.  Moreover, Rabinovich does a nice job of capturing the Arab, and particularly the Egyptian, point of view.  Unlike previous Arab military misadventures, The Yom Kippur War was based more upon the demands of realpolitik and less upon ideology than ever before.  Egypt took a calculated roll of the dice, and in spite of taking a beating, over time accomplished all of their goals as a result.<br />Tactically, The Yom Kippur War set a new standard for ferocity and violence in a relatively compact area.  Never before had so much firepower been deployed so quickly and to such great effect.  In particular, the massive deployment of RPG's and precision anti-tank weapons marked a genuine revolution in military affairs that rocked Israel to its very core.  However, Rabinovich indicates a deft grasp of the rapid vacillations between offense and defense as he revisits the roles and interactions of infantry and tank time and again.  Moreover, his purview isn't limited to tactics alone as he lays out a litany of failures in Israel's grand strategy which included such basic errors as a failure to dictate the shape of the battlefield by trading land for time, the failure to exploit greater maneuverability in flanking attacks, and the failure to concentrate armor at the critical point.  All of these lapses would be glaring in most any army, but in Israel, where the tank reigned supreme, they were unforgivable.  Likewise, he considers similar interactions between the fighter-bomber and the SAM at both the tactical and strategic level.<br />However, as I said before, this isn't a dry recitation of tactics and plans.  Rabinovich infused his narrative with anecdotes and primary sources that nicely capture the tremendous pressure that Israel faced, and the enormous ingenuity that allowed it to eventually turn the tide.  Arab perspective is likewise strong in the early sections and again at the book's conclusion, but is noticeably lacking during the actual fighting.  Given the even-handedness and professionalism with which Rabinovich writes, it is my opinion that this is probably due to a regrettable lack of source material.  This conclusion is supported by the fact that it is a problem that spans most Mid-Eastern military history as largely autocratic societies have little incentive to release information about their military's consistently mediocre performance.  Also, Ariel Sharonis a central figure in the Yom Kippur War, and any student of current events will gain tremendous insight into his actions today from Rabinovich's portrait of him thirty years ago.<br />In terms of geopolitics, Rabinovich pays little head to the UN (appropriate given their total irrelevance in the war, which was in turn a function of their total ineptitude in the months before, during and after the Six Day War) but does a superb job of a detailing Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy and a surprisingly good job capturing the Kremlin's machinations.  What is perhaps most shocking about these details is how completely out of the loop Nixon was as Watergate came crashing down around him.  Had Kissinger not taken the initiative, it is entirely likely that a radically different, and most likely much worse scenario would have unfolded.<br />Finally, in a brief, but excellent conclusion, Rabinovich revisits the root causes of the war and considers how they changed because of the conflict.  Of course, the most obvious outcome is the détente between Israel and Egypt that developed over the following six years, but the author also eloquently captures the wrenching national introspection that Israel underwent.  The Yom Kippur War was a watershed that led to a complete rethinking of not just Israel's military, but it's entire world view.<br />To conclude, \\"The Yom Kippur War\\" has all of the characteristics of the best military history.  Evenhanded and unflinching in criticism, offering astute insight and a superb portrait of men at war, Rabinovich has written what may prove to be the definitive history of the war.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-04-13
US	48242885	R2ZXYKN54SW6GD	0375705457	931553433	Camp Concentration: A Novel	Books	4	22	25	N	N	A pardox beset with paradoxes	\\"Camp Concentration\\" plays on some familiar themes: government subverting the will of the people, technology as mechanism of human downfall, to name two.  As such, one might be tempted to pass it by, which would be a terrible mistake.  Thomas Disch has produced a novel that is perhaps unique in Cold War fiction, for even as it decries the folly of military adventurism (in the form of a war in Malaysia which has presumably spread from Vietnam) it also considers the individual's culpability in national mistakes.  Ultimately, he questions whether principled, but passive, opposition is just that, or if it is a form of ego not far removed from the motivations of those who are being protested.<br />Set in a secret government installation, \\"Camp Concentration\\" consists of the journal of Louis Sacchetti, a conscientious objector and prisoner, not to mention poet, who has been brought in to document the installation with a critical, but unscientific eye.  The reason for this is that the population of this installation (except for administrators and staff) have been injected with Pallidine, a substance derived from syphilis that grants vastly expanded mental capabilities even as it ultimately kills the recipient..  Needless to say, those who receive it are being used to develop super-weapons, although they have other ideas.<br />To offer any more than this brief sketch would surely spoil the plot, but it is the subtext that makes this a superb novel.  First is the fascinating, and entirely unexpected, consideration of religion.  Sacchetti, who is something of a born again Catholic, suffuses his journal with religious references.  Moreover, the Pallidine is clearly and allegory for the Forbidden Fruit, the source of both enlightenment and death.  However, the consideration of religion is far more free-ranging than simple metaphor, as Disch lays out a compelling, if oblique argument, that if God is dead or absent, it is because we offer no opportunity for Him to act through us.Hence, it isn't enough to decry injustice, one must actively subvert it.<br />At the same time, there is a countervailing theme of the question of motivation: do the ends justify the means?  Normally, this is an intriguing, if somewhat shopworn, focal point for a novel, but when set as a dichotomy with religion, it makes for fascinating reading.<br />Finally, several reviewers question the ending of the book.  While I empathize with their reaction, I think there is a point, a denouement in the literal sense of the word, which is being missed.  This is because Sacchetti's fate (with out giving anything away) joins the two threads of the book, morality and expediency, as it were, in a conclusion that is satisfying, but also open to discussion or even rebuttal.<br />I frequently struggle with fiction from the Cold War era (that deals with it explicitly) because it is almost always black and white: one is in favor of nuking Russia or totally against the \\"illegal\\" war in Vietnam.  There is never any middle ground, any room for debate, and intelligent conversation is stifled as a result.  Fortunately, in \\"Camp Concentration\\" Disch followed his own path and created a novel that revels in the gray.  Entertaining on the surface, nuanced and subtle underneath, this is a novel that is not to be missed.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-02-29
US	48242885	RABNEFIKJVASW	0374278431	117551051	Tonguecat: A Novel	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Fascinating and original; a new direction in fiction	There are some novels that take such a different path from what a reader is used to that they are absorbed more than read.  In other words, they cannot be truly appreciated until they are completed, because their ultimate purpose is hidden from the reader by original forms and language.  \\"Tonguecat\\" is undeniably one of those novels.  Peter Verhelst has created a world that is disturbingly familiar to our own, and yet populated by constructs that for all their apparent normalcy are vastly different from anything in our experience.  <br />Set in what I would assume to be the relatively near future, Tonguecat occurs in an unnamed kingdom where the world has frozen over in a rapid ice age.  As such, all life begins to revolve around warmth, as a practical matter, but also as an ideology or philosophy.  Crime revolves around seeking warmth, and as the cold bleaches the world of hope, dreams become the preferred currency.<br />Thus, the setting is relatively simply described, but the plot is far more difficult.  First, Verhelst has chosen to tell his story from multiple points of view.  Much like Mitchell's \\"Ghostwritten\\", each section stands on its own, but the ultimate purpose, or overarching narrative thread, isn't revealed until the final chapters.  Verhelst plays with themes of free will, truth and desire, and comments on our own world where perception is frequently treated as reality, even when it stands starkly at odds with the truth.<br />Beyond this unusual narrative arrangement, Verhelst toys with mythology and religion, to the point where I would argue that he has invented a new creation myth, or perhaps more accurately, a re-creation myth.  There are literal references to Greek mythology in the form of Prometheus and the Titans, which is interesting in and of itself because unlike the relatively ordered life of the Greek gods, the titans were primeval beings, existing in a maelstrom of chaos and violence.  This essence is revisited countless times as the kingdom comes unhinged in ever greater and less justifiable acts of violence which rather explicitly echo places like Chechnya and the former Yugoslavia.  On top of this mythological element, there are references to the Judeo-Christian tradition of varying levels of obliqueness.  From rather explicit references to the lives of the saints to strong echoes to the story of Noah, there is an element of religiosity which infuses \\"Tonguecat\\".<br />The characters are a fascinating blend of the high and the low; from the young king to a peasant boy who has lost his family, each has a part to play in this odd tapestry, but only one has even a rough appreciation of what is actually happening, and even then his grasp is tenuous.  As such, this is a novel that will have as many interpretations as readings.  To a degree, this is something of a problem as the sometimes random motivations of the characters can bog down the reader's progress as one struggles to keep up with the rather jarring shifts in narrative flow.  However, this problem is ultimately surpassed by Verhelst's adventurous style and commitment to his concept, which I found myself admiring even as I was sometimes frustrated by it.<br />While not an easy read, \\"Tonguecat\\" has the potential to become an \\"important\\" book in the evolution of 21st century fiction.  A compelling fusion of Swanwick and Bradbury, it contains all of the former's deliberate, challenging weirdness while remaining steeped in the latter's disturbing familiarity.  When combined with an original narrative form and an almost psychedelic use of language, Verhelst has produced a novel that is both fascinating and original.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-02-22

Let's face it: at one time or another we've all faced a zombie scare we aren't prepared for.  And yes, the local constabulary usually cleans things up with a minimum of fuss, but what happens when things go wrong and the cavalry doesn't arrive?  That, my friends, is the day that Max Brooks' \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" saves your life.  With several millennia worth of field experience distilled into a manageable 254 pages, everything you need to know to survive the coming war with the undead can be found in these pages.  Your life and the lives of those you love are at stake, act now and be prepared!<br />OK, so that paragraph was obviously tongue in cheek, but hopefully in conveys some sense of what Brooks' remarkable \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is like.  While obviously a parody of both the horror genre and civil defense/survivalist manuals, it maintains an \\"all-business\\" demeanor, never once cracking the façade to reveal the underlying humoristic intent.  The result is a book that is, when taken as a whole, a funny, incredibly thorough work of satire.  However, at the same time, page-by-page, it is a rather accomplished addition to zombie horror.<br />Starting with zombie physiology and then moving on to weapons, tactics, long-term strategy and history Brooks has produced a manual which has a thoroughness that belies the absurdity of its subject.  Point by point he discusses the pros and cons of rifles, machetes and flamethrowers, then considers the optimal defensive positions for various types of outbreaks.  After an extensive discussion of survival in a zombie doomsday scenario, he lays out zombie outbreaks through history, and what their implications are.  Throughout, entries are extensively cross-referenced and alternative courses of action are always weighed for potential risks and benefits.<br />The remarkable thing about all this is that Brooks has managed to infuse a tension, and urgency into his manual that makes for great reading.  Part post-apocalypticfiction, part \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and part \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch, this is a book that should hold appeal across a broad range of genres.  Thorough without being dry, creepy without being clichéd, and funny without relying on cheap laughs, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is undoubtedly one of the most original books I have ever read, and one that I enjoyed reading immensely.  If you appreciate any or all of these genres, or if you just enjoy a well executed, original idea, this is definitely a book you'll want to check out.<br />And remember...Tomorrow may be too late, read this book today!<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-01-20

However, for those who have already read \\"City of Saints and Madmen\\" and \\"Veniss Underground\\", this collection should provide interesting insight into Vandermeer's later, more polished works.  A slim collection, it can easily be read in a sitting or two, but there are elements that echo and foreshadow themes found elsewhere in his writing.<br />\\"The Day Dali Died\\" contains three types of writing poetry, flash fiction (stories only a page or two in length) and more traditional short stories that run from five to ten pages.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the poetry; I knew that Vandermeer had begun his career as a poet, and had later moved on to fiction.  I assumed that this change of direction was the result of a lack of talent, but many of the poems were actually quite good.  There are too many to consider in great detail, but there are a few highlights worth mentioning.   \\"Flight Is For Those Who Have Not Crossed Over\\" explores cruel hope in a place where by all rights there should be none.  \\"Four Theories Of Earth-Moon System Formation\\" covers exactly what the title suggests, but in a remarkably engaging and original way.  Finally, there is my personal favorite \\"An Afterlife\\" which beautifully, yet poignantly, considers the ultimate fate of our greatest monuments and to a degree ourselves.<br />For the most part, the short fiction is likewise good, but the entries are bookended by two remarkable pieces that display the full range of Vandermeer's talent.  First is \\"The Songs a Dead Whale Sings\\" which describes a bizarre milieu that hints at the wonder, absurdity and  the sometimes capricious violence of his Ambergris stories.  At the other end of the spectrum is \\"At the Crossroads, Burying the Dog\\"; Vandermeer has perfectly captured the pain of losing a pet, andmore than that, what a pet means to our emotional development.  On the surface, this piece seems utterly foreign to Vandermeer's other work.  However, his use of the second person presages the second section of \\"Veniss Underground\\", and it is interesting how personal the voice becomes.  Secondly, the story is infused with a pathos and dark humor that is familiar from many of the Ambergris stories.<br />Certainly not the best of Vandermeer, \\"The Day Dali Died\\" nonetheless is an engaging collection that offers intriguing glimpses into the author's development as a writer.  While not for someone new to Vandermeer, those who have enjoyed his other works will be drawn in by familiar elements in entirely new settings.  Moreover, his poetry is original, well written and an intriguing break from his fiction.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-01-17

While the first volume was fairly sound, \\"What If? 2\\" and now \\"What Ifs? of American History\\" are plagued by uneven quality of writing, questionable conclusions and most surprising, a pronounced lack of allo-historical content.  For a series that defines itself by what might have been, the lack of authors willing to make leaps into the future is a serious, perhaps even crippling problem for any future editions.  Identifying tipping points is generally well done, but that is something one finds in conventional history; it is projecting a meaningful alternate outcome rooted in historical fact that defines alternate history, and it is that projection that is becoming less prevalent with each passing volume.<br />That said, I don't want to indict every author who contributed to \\"What Ifs? of American History\\", as there are some genuinely excellent contributions.  However, taken as a whole the seventeen chapters are something of a let down.  This is true not least because two of the pieces are reprinted from the original \\"What If?\\"; while there is nothing wrong with them in their own right, I find it sorely disappointing that a major hardcover release couldn't drum up new contributions.<br />The problem with many of the contributions is that they find an engaging turning point, and then fail to flesh it out.  This is true from the start in \\"Might the Mayflower Not have Sailed?\\" which makes a compelling case that this was possible, and outlines significant consequences, but never ties them together to paint a cohesive portrait of how a different America might have evolved.  <BR>\\"The Northwest Conspiracy\\" is another work that is admirable for a number of reasons.  First, it identifies a relatively obscure event (which always make for the most interesting divergences), and secondly, it offers a superb overview of the gross violations of the Constitution committed by the Lincoln administration during the Civil War.  Nonetheless, the speculation never evolves into genuine alternate history, and therefore the piece is something of a let down.  Finally, there is \\"The Revolution of 1877\\" which does delve into some alternate history, but which could have been fleshed out to even greater effect.<br />\\"William Pitt the Elder and the Avoidance of the American Revolution\\" has the opposite problem as it draws conclusions that are to my mind entirely unsupportable.  Carr's portrait of the British Empire as a force for benevolent change doesn't seem to be born out in the historical record.  The same is true of \\"JFK Lives\\" which seems all to ready to ignore Kennedy's cynical manipulation of Cold War politics to his own ends, his relative clumsiness in foreign policy, his hawkish advisors and his indifference to any real momentum in the civil rights movement.  Finally, there is \\"Joe McCarthy's Secret Life\\" which while somewhat allo-historical is really more of a secret history.  An amusing, tongue in cheek look at one of America's most loathsome politicians, but not really alternate history.<br />Next are three works that never go anywhere.  \\"No Pearl Harbor? FDR Delays the War\\" and \\"If Eisenhower Had Gone to Berlin\\" both change history and then predict virtually identical outcomes.  Such considerations are valuable in traditional history, but they aren't really alternate timelines as things rapidly converge back to what we know in months or years.  Finally \\"'His Accidency' John Tyler\\" raises an interesting question about presidential succession, and then fails utterly to answer what the impact would be.<br />Now with the negatives aside, let's focus on the highlights.  \\"Lew Wallace and the Ghosts of Shunpike\\" is a far ranging contribution that posits military, cultural and political impacts springing from the battle of Shiloh.  Next is \\"Beyond the Wildest Dreams of John Wilkes Booth\\" which examines a Constitutional crisis and a guerilla South to great effect.  \\"The Whale Against the Wolf: The Anglo-American War of 1896\\" is another interesting military piece that also addresses the shocking absence of Canada  (and Mexico) from this book in any meaningful sense.<br />\\"If the U-2 Hadn't Flown\\" suffers from some of the problems above, but ultimately offers so much detail on the consequences of Gary Powers' ill-fate flight it overcomes them.  Which brings us to the highlight of the book \\"The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust\\".  Written from an entirely allo-historical point of view, this piece offers a realistic divergence with realistic consequences.  Of particular note is the author's appreciation of how vastly larger the U.S. nuclear arsenal was than the Soviet.  Not only does this justify the level of destruction of the author envisions, but it is a salient point in that the Kennedy administration seemed to have bought into the myth of the missile gap, in spite of blatant evidence to the contrary.  This willful ignorance led Khrushchev to believe Kennedy something of a bumpkin, and ultimately contributed to the decision to deploy missiles to Cuba in the first place.<br />Finally there is \\"What If Watergate Were Still Just an Upscale Address?\\" which like the U-2 piece isn't exactly allo-historical.  However, it likewise makes up for this fact with a wealth of detailed consequences.<br />As one can see, I have mixed feelings about this book.  Ultimately, the good outweighs the bad, and I can honestly recommend it to history and alternate history lovers.  That said, I think that the overall direction of this series and the consistency and methodology of the contributions need to be seriously considered before any future releases.  As such, I know that I will turn a more critical eye to any future books, and will probably hesitate before making a purchase.<br />Jake Mohlman	2004-01-05
US	48242885	R21EEQVSULAYFZ	0297843478	484979883	How to Keep Dinosaurs	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Critical information for the dinosaur owner	\\"How to Keep Dinosaurs\\" is a must have for any dinosaur lover, because as the author clearly points out (using a handy graphical directory) some dinosaurs are good with babies and others eat babies, and knowing the difference is both critical and not easily discerned.  Moreover, some dinosaurs are, er..., more openly amorous than is generally considered tasteful, and others pass worrying amounts of gas.  Still others require government permits, so it is best to check local laws and regulations.    With tongue planted firmly in cheek Robert Mash has produced a book that is always entertaining, but which is also more informative than he would probably openly admit.  \\"How to Keep Dinosaurs\\" is broken up into sections such as pets, flying dinosaurs and farmable dinosaurs; one might think of these sections as a cross between the groupings at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and those at a state fair.  Within each section Mash then presents a variety of dinosaurs, and cogitates on their relative merits and weaknesses.  Each one of these dino bios follows more or less the same approach: a derivation of the creature's name (usually accurately translated, but hilariously misunderstood), a general description of breed characteristics, a synopsis of housing/food requirements, breeding possibilities and finally, where to buy the dinosaur if you are interested.  As I alluded to above, each dinosaur also comes with handy quick reference icons for such attributes as \\"worryingly smart\\" or \\"picky eater\\".    While much of what Mash writes is clever fiction, he has generally tried to be as accurate as possible.  For example, the smart dinosaurs are generally carnivores, and information about diet and breeding is vague, but will get specific when supported by the fossil record.  Furthermore, dinosaurs are always available for purchase where they have been discovered, so Mongolian and North American breeders are heavily represented.  It is obvious that Mash didn't pick his dinosaursat random, but rather tried to make logical choices for his various categories based upon what is know to science.  Finally, Mash works in little bits of paleontology's history with such asides as Iguanadons being successfully raised in coal mines in Germany (they were first discovered in a coal mine in Germany).    All that said, \\"How to Keep Dinosaurs\\" wouldn't be the book it is if it not for the superb illustrations.  Photo-realistic dinosaurs veritably leap of the page and are frequently shown happily frolicking with their owners.      The illustrations will engage any child, but it would be a mistake to consider this a children's book.  The writing is well beyond the abilities of an early reader, and the humor, while by no means offensive, is aimed squarely at adults.  So, if you are an adult who has never outgrown your fascination with dinosaurs, and who still whimsically ponders how cool it would be to have your own, this is well written and beautifully illustrated book is a must read.    Enjoy!    Jake Mohlman	2003-12-31
US	48242885	R1YZLYIXJUMBBQ	1902880668	223603532	Fuzzy Dice	Books	5	16	16	N	N	All Across the Multiverse	First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors.  Specifically, \\"Fuzzy Dice\\" by Paul Di Filippo was limited to 200 slip-cased hardcovers and another 500 regular hardcover copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher.  Moreover, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.<br />A relatively recent theory in physics suggest that there is not just the one universe in which we reside, but an infinite number of universes that represent an infinite number of possible variations.  For example, there is a universe where aliens invaded Earth in 1492 and another where there is no Moon.  Of course this represents just the tip of the iceberg, as there are an infinite number of universes that are beyond the abilities of human conception.  Conversely, the very fact that one could conceive of a universe means that exists somewhere (or perhaps more accurately, sometime).  So a world where a megalomaniacal Mickey Mouse rules Earth from his base on Mars is no more or less likely than one in which the Boston Red Sox never traded Babe Ruth.<BR> <BR>So when Paul Girard was granted the ability to travel among the universes by a post-human time traveler, he was understandably pleased.  Here was an escape from the everyday drudgery of his plainly wasted life.  The doorway to the full spectrum of human desire and ambition was placed literally at his fingertip in the form of a yo-yo.  Made of \\"strange matter\\" drawn from pre-Big Bang space, it will, with a flick of Paul's wrist and a thought of where he wants to go, take him zooming across the multiverse.  Unfortunately, as Paul quickly realizes, in a continuum of an infinite number of universes, one should be exceedingly particular about where one wants to go.  While you might intend to jump to a world run by the Playboy bunnies, you could very easily end up in a world run by bloodthirsty Amazons.<BR> <BR>As one might expect, Paul does just that (although under a variety of different circumstances) and pretty much makes a mess out of what should have been the greatest gift ever given to a mortal man.  Nonetheless, along the way he inadvertently, and often unwillingly, learns a little something about himself.  However, he is routinely thwarted in his efforts to resolve the \\"Ontological Pickle\\" as he puts it; simply stated it is, \\"What started everything?\\"  What came before the Big Bang, or in this instance, what came before all of the Big Bangs?  No matter how complex space-time actually is, and no matter how thoroughly it is understood, there has to be an Alpha Point, as it were, a space-time with nothing before it.  But if such a place exists, what caused it to spring from nothing into something?  It is these questions that gnaw at Paul, and even as he learns more and improves his physical and mental state, he comes no closer to the answer.<BR> <BR>However, after a catastrophically bad jump, Paul and his companions (a son, (the result of a digital data swap) and Moonbeam, his erstwhile wife (a one time militant virgin hippy transformed into a bookworm nymphomaniac)) face certain death.  That's when things get really interesting.<br />All that sounds like pretty heavy subject matter, but in Di Filippo's able hands, it is both hilarious and fascinating.  Paul's miscalculations are so obvious in retrospect, one can't help but laugh, however, at the same time, the various worlds are by no means clichés.  No matter how bizarre the setting, Di Filippo manages to lend a realism that drives the story forward.<br />Moreover, the author's consideration of the \\"Ontological Pickle\\" is exceptionally deft.  Through quantum physics, he is able to create a theory of creation and God, of \\"everything\\" really, that makes sense and applies a subtle logic to religion.  Though obviously only a hypothesis, Di Filippo's distillation of science, philosophy and religion is both profound and sound.<br />\\"Fuzzy Dice\\" is a novel that defies categorization, as it uses humorous science fiction to explore our deepest mysteries.  Moreover, Di Filippo weaves in a great deal of science, but in a manner so subtle it would make Michael Crichton drool.  This is truly one of the most original novels I have ever encountered, and I am certain it will be one I revisit many times.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-12-18

Specifically, \\"In Springdale Town\\" by Robert Freeman Wexler was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher.  Moreover, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.<br />\\"In Springdale Town&quot; is an intriguing and enigmatic look at the nature of reality, in many ways similar to Danielewski's remarkable &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.  Both are open ended in their conclusions, and both make deft use of &quot;footnotes&quot; to hint at a surface barely scratched.  However, whereas &quot;House of Leaves&quot; focuses on (among many other things) the ability of our internal mental state to dictate the circumstances our external one, &quot;In Springdale Town&quot; takes a different approach and explores how our thoughts and actions can impact, and even create, other realities.<br />In this regard, &quot;In Springdale&quot; town shows its science fiction foundation, for the two main characters, lawyer Patrick Travis and actor Richard Shelling, represent universes that are neither mutually exclusive nor entirely compatible.  The town of Springdale is a nexus of sorts for the two men, but hints as to why lead to more questions as to the nature of reality.  Moreover, there are traffic cops, after a fashion, who seem to be charged with controlling and rationalizing cross universe transits.  As the two men are sucked into a world that is both plainly flawed and clearly of their own creation, it becomes obvious that there is some sort of balance that needs to be restored.<br />As this need becomes more urgent, it leads to a conclusion wherein Wexler frames an ontological riddle that could most simply be described as &quot;When you look in the mirror, are you seeing your reflection, or are you the reflection of the person in the mirror?&quot;  There is a chicken and the egg approach to his multiverse that seems to suggest that the power of perception plays a key roll in propping up our very existence.  If one allows themselves to get stuck between realities, to become uncertain as to what is real and what is not, they risk not only insanity, but quite literally bringing down their world around them.  Conversely, those who take the &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; approach shore up their reality and assure its existence.  Which leads to the question: if one's fantasy worlds become more real than their own world can they be destroyed by them.<br />Having reread the review to this point, I am rather embarrassed by all of my verbal back-flips and uses of the word &quot;reality&quot;.  However, in many ways this is the best compliment I can pay to &quot;In Springdale Town&quot;; for a short book it presents a host of mysteries and philosophical questions, and I suspect that anyone who reads this book on my recommendation will draw completely different conclusions.  The simplest endorsement I can offer for &quot;In Springdale Town&quot; is that will definitely engage the reader and leave one with more to ponder than one would expect from eighty-odd pages.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-12-17
US	48242885	R3M9MEO46AWNM3	1902880293	851725011	Park Polar	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Some interesting ideas, but ultimately disappointing	First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors.  Specifically, \\"Park Polar\\" by Adam Roberts was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, all of which have long since sold out from the publisher.  That said, there are copies available on the internet, but unless you are a collector, I would recommend passing on this novella.<br />I say that with some regret as this is the first time that I've ever had anything less than glowing things to say about a PS Publishing novel, but unfortunately, I can't see my way to recommending \\"Park Polar\\".  The setting is interesting enough, in a dystopian future where all of the arable land is used to produce food for the insatiable and ever-growing population, the Arctic pack ice has been turned into the last refuge for wildlife.  More accurately, it is the home to genetically engineered (or \\"genengineered\\") wildebeests and lions, and of course, the associated researchers.<br />So the basic premise is interesting enough; a remote research station, a murder, major corporate interests, but right off the bat there are significant holes.  For one thing, why set the story in the Arctic?  Given that Antarctica is actual land, it would make a much more logical setting.  Another oddity is the fact the primary narrative focus, a scientist by the name of Annalee McCullough, is brought in to introduce kangaroos to the habitat.  No this is an admittedly a contrived ecosystem, but why kangaroos?  Since there are already wildebeest and lions, wouldn't zebras or antelopes make more sense?  A final example would be how Roberts repeatedly has his characters eat the pack ice when they are thirsty.  I'm no survival expert, but anyone who has spent any time outdoors in the winter knows this is just about the surest route to hypothermia there is.  Inconsistencies like these pop up repeatedly and spoil what hasthe potential to be an intriguing premise.<br />However, it is the characters that ultimately let this story down.  They are far too two-dimensional and their motivations are never clear.  Moreover, they are in many ways caricatures, and I never felt particularly sympathetic towards any of them.  Finally, their interactions are horribly stilted (including an incredibly awkward and entirely unnecessary love scene); Roberts never convinced me that these were real people in a real setting, and when one can't suspend one's disbelief, science fiction never works.<br />There is a lot of promise and some compelling ideas in \\"Park Polar\\", which is why I gave it two stars.  Unfortunately, it never lives up to its intriguing basis, and is let down by weak characterizations.  There are tons of great titles from PS Publishing, but this is unfortunately not one of them; it's with some disappointment that I recommend skipping it.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-11-15

Specifically, \\"The Uglimen\\" by Mark Morris was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher.  Moreover, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.<br />There are certain literary devices that one finds commonly: there are narrative devices (flashbacks, different voices, etc.) and there are plot types that seem to be universal (family strife, hidden Nazi gold, cults, etc.).  However, just because these elements are common, doesn't mean that they are usually executed well.  More often, one will find an intriguing idea let down by poor writing, or conversely, brilliant characters in a world where nothing particularly compelling happens.<br />Happily, in the case of \\"The Uglimen\\" neither of these things is true.  The story opens in L.A. in 1969 as two rather bedraggled and undeniably terrified Britons flee from an undefined, but very real, danger.  The story then flashes forward to London in 2001 where Rob Loomis' world is turned upside down when his father inexplicably commits suicide.  Obviously these lines must intersect, but it is some time, and an additional flashback before the linkage is made clear.  It's difficult to give an idea of the plot without spoiling it (the book is only 144 pages after all) but generally speaking it revolves around a stolen religious relic and the attendant cult that wants it back.<br />Now, the religious relic/cult theme has been done to death in countless other novels, some good, far more bad.  Fortunately, Morris manages to inject some original elements, which combined with his superb pacing and excellent characterization makes for a book that is a fantastic read.First off, Morris creates a cult that is two-tiered, being made up of extremists and a more benign movement that is wrapped up in the hippie culture of the 1960's.  As a result, motivations are never clear, and it is nearly impossible to predict the course events will take.  Secondly, Morris packs several surprising twists into this novella.  Given the limited length, such changes could be jarring or contrived, but in the author's capable hands they only serve to ratchet up the tension.<br />However, what makes this book genuinely remarkable is the understated, but pervasive theme of family.  The interaction between Rob and his mother in the wake of his father's death is beautifully rendered.  Their grief practically leaps off the page; clearly Morris writes from the experience of having lost someone near and dear, and anyone who has faced such a situation will immediately realize how on the mark he is.  Beyond the death, however, is a remarkable look at the relationships between parents and their children, particularly their adult children.  Morris has deftly captured that moment that happens to all of us when we realize that our parents had a life before us, not a theoretical one, but one, which contained triumphs and failures, and things that are unknown to us.  Such a revelation can be uncomfortable, but it can also lead to a greater awareness of one's parents as human beings with wants and needs the same as one's own.<br />\\"The Uglimen\\" is an entertaining, beautifully written novel.  From its puzzling beginning to its rather shocking conclusion, it tells a story that is both scary and engaging.  The phrase \\"I couldn't put it down\\" is used all too often and is one I shy away from, but in this case it is absolutely true.  This is a book that should certainly be purchased if the opportunity arises, but beyond that, it should be actively sought out.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-11-15

Specifically, \\"A Year in the Linear Citry\\" was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, and at the time of this writing, some copies were still available from the publisher.  Moreover, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.<br />The story is set in the eponymous Linear City, which actually constitutes an entire world; one long, straight road with buildings on either side.  Odd, yes, but not entirely without precedent; one might think of it as one of the \\"ringworlds\\" found elsewhere in science fiction where the inhabitants live on the outer surface rather than the interior.  What really sets the Linear City apart, though, is the fact that it is bounded quite literally, by Hell on one side, and Heaven on the other.  Overhead, angels and devils await death and swoop in to remove corporeal remains, as well as the deceased's soul, right at the moment of death.<br />Admittedly, this is a rather simplistic view of di Filippo's creation.  While \\"hell\\" (referred to as The Wrong Side of the Tracks) is admittedly unsettling, it isn't conclusively a place a of eternal damnation.  At the same time, heaven, or the Other Shore, seems benign enough, but again, no one knows for sure.  Ultimately, it doesn't really matter, as the residents of the Linear City are largely accepting of their strange circumstance, and while this odd arrangement does inform the book, it isn't its primary focus.<br />Rather, di Filippo has chosen to explore the city, or more specifically one of its millions of boroughs, through the eye's of one of its residents over the course of one year.  Incidentally, Diego Patchen is also a writer of science fiction, and as such, he is perhaps the resident of Linear City bestequipped to consider alternatives to his own world, and at the same time, most likely to be befuddled by their odd, and seemingly preordained, circumstance.  Through Patchen, di Filippo explore simple, but familiar themes: friendship, love, ambition, family relations, etc., but no one of these elements dominates the narrative.  In this way, di Filippo reminds me strongly of Stephen King's best short stories; in them, he is often more interested in the journey than the conclusion, and that is certainly the case here.  Di Filippo's world is so vibrant, and also so mysterious, it could fill far more than the slim eighty pages in this volume.<br />Fortunately, I have seen indications that another Linear City volume is in the works, and when it is released I will do my best to be first in the digital queue at PS Publishing.  Ultimately, that is the best endorsement I can offer for \\"A Year in the Linear City\\": I will revisit it in a heartbeat.  Di Filippo has clearly imagined vastly more than he has written, and the questions he leaves with the reader are numerous: what are the scales? Who built the Linear City?  Does it have an end?  More than that, by writing characters who are everyday people, he makes the reader immensely sympathetic towards them.  I for one will gladly spend another year in the Linear City with Diego and his friends.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-11-07
US	48242885	R1KLVN3WYUS88O	1582432236	390304025	Schopenhauer's Telescope	Books	4	15	15	N	Y	Ambitious, original novel	Gerard Donvan's novel \\"Schopenhauer's Telescope\\" take as it's focal point an act that was carried out all too often during Europe's tortured twentieth century: the digging of a mass grave.  One would expect that such a setting would provide for a rather limited narrative, but as it turns out, the opposite is true.  \\"Schopenhauer's Telescope\\" sprawls in every direction, touching upon a host of topics and exploring so many themes that it is sometimes to its detriment.  Nonetheless, this is a powerful novel, that succeeds far more often than it fails.<br />The central characters are Baker and Teacher; they share a conversation in an unknown field in an unknown European country as the Baker digs what is clearly intended to be a grave.  As I mentioned above, their conversation meanders across a host of topics, but one recurrent theme repeats itself, or perhaps two that intertwine.  The theme is history, but the two men have drastically different feelings about what it means and how it should be studied.<br />The Baker views history as an inexorable tide, something to be survived rather than engaged, because survival is the core purpose of his existence.  The Teacher, on the other hand, views history as a living, breathing thing; something that cannot be understood in its entirety, but which can be embraced and learned from.<br />While this conversation is fascinating, the most intriguing element of this book is the dichotomy it sets up between the two men.  What are their roles?  How have they each found their way to this snowy field?  The reader is left uncertain as to who holds the power in the relationship until well into the narrative, and even then, one is left to question which man really understands the world, and more importantly, his place in it.<br />Unfortunately, the novel is at times horribly over-written.  Donovan enjoys playing with various approaches to his narrative, and generally speaking he is successful.  However, there are times when form trumps substance and this can make for tedious reading.  Moreover, over the course of two ill-advised segments, he reveals one of the characters (saying which one would be a major spoiler) to be somewhat insane, which significantly curbed any sympathy or compassion I might have felt for him.  Moreover, it is difficult to judge the mentally ill for their actions, and the book's endgame suffers somewhat as a result.<br />That said, the positives in \\"Schopenhauer's Telescope\\" more than outweigh the negatives.  At its best, Donovan's writing borders on poetry, and his style represents a genuinely original voice.  This is a novel rich in ideas and philosophy, but it is also a novel that raises more questions than it answers.  What is a life well lived?  What makes life worth living?  Is evil absolute, or does it need to be taken in context?  These questions just scratch the surface, and I suspect that additional readings would reveal additional questions, and that furthermore, other readers will take away completely different questions.  \\"Schopenhauer's Telescope\\" is just one of those books that can be interpreted a dozen different ways by a dozen different people without any of them being wrong.  While far from perfect, Donovan's work is among the best I have read this year, and will, I am certain, stay with me for some time to come.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-11-06

Specifically, \\"Naming of Parts\\" was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, all of which have long since sold out from the publisher.  That said, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.<br />Generally speaking, I'm not really a fan of zombie fiction (assuming zombie refers to the living dead); the premise strikes me as so absurd, so beyond the realm of possibility, that I just can't suspend my disbelief and enjoy the story.  However, in \\"Naming of Parts\\", Tim Lebbon had produced a novel that is so perfectly conceived, it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.<br />First and foremost, his narrator is a twelve year old boy, Jack.  By telling his tale through Jack's eyes, Lebbon is able heighten the horror of the situation.  To a young boy, the world is full of possibilities, many of them grim, and by choosing a boy as his narrative focus, Lebbon is able to strip away the incredulousness of the adult reader.  Secondly, Lebbon only alludes to the cause of the zombie infestation without getting into explicit causes.  As such, there is the implication that there is a scientific explanation for what happened.  In this regard, \\"Naming of Parts\\" is strongly reminiscent of Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\" which uses biology to explain vampires.  By taking this approach, both authors are able to ground the unbelievable in some semblance of reality, which makes their writing all the more menacing.<br />Finally, Lebbon's zombies are pervasive; everything in nature, from the grass to squirrels to humans is alive in appearance, but already dead inside.  There is a sense of winding down, of inertia, about Lebbon's creations.  While they are menacing and dangerous in their own right, there is at least the possibility for Jack and his family to carry on because the zombies seem to lose their edge with every passing minute.<br />All of these elements are key to the success of \\"Naming of Parts\\", but what really makes it stand out is the relationship between Jack and his parents.  Neither a child nor an adult, Jack's in between age makes him perfect main character.  In particular, in a world turned on end, Jack both wants to protect and be protect by his parents.  In fact, the book takes its title from Jack's attempt to be brave and adult by naming the parts of his fears (i.e. the window blowing, the tree tapping on his window, etc.), but how does one name the unbelievable?  Such sentiment could easily be overblown and maudlin, but Lebbon deftly captures the poignancy of this interaction without bogging down in Hallmark card sentiment.<br />The first of a projected four part series for PS Publishing, \\"Naming of Parts\\" is a must read for fans of apocalyptic or zombie fiction.  Lebbon explores genres that are full of retreads from entirely new angles, and his writing is superb.  Containing the perfect blend of tension, fear and hope, this is a tale that is well worth seeking out.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-10-25

Specifically, \\"Nearly People\\" was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, all of which have long since sold out from the publisher.  That said, there are copies available on the internet, and should the opportunity to acquire a copy present itself, I would strongly recommend doing so.<br />\\"Nearly People\\" is the tale of Carrier, a resident of The Howling Mile; a blasted disease infested blight of a city that is sealed off from the surrounding world, quite literally, by an enormous glass dome.  Moreover, it is patrolled ceaselessly by border guards who assure that no one moves in or out.  However, it is the other residents of The Howling Mile that offer the most danger to Carrier; humans and hideous mutations alike that are liked firmly in survival mode, concerned only with their day to day existance.<br />Just as Carrier's lover succumbs to one of the plagues that infests the city, and just as Carrier seems destined to lose all hope, a mysterious man, the Dancer, comes into her life.  Over time, he teaches Carrier to tap the well of her very humanity, so that she might slip across realities, and one day flee The Howling Mile.  However, it becomes clear that the Dancer is not entirely what he seems to be, and that there is more to The Howling Mile than meets the eye.<br />In less than one hundred pages, Williams has produced a tale that contains three hundred pages worth of story.  Every page is imbued with not only the rank reality of The Howling Mile, but also the beauty that hides within its citizens.  Carrier, in spite of the short time for characterization, is beautifully realized.  Her emotions aren't subtle, but they are universal.  Williams expertly examines hope and despair, and reveals how they are frequently different sides of the same coin.<br />However, it is the conclusion of \\"Nearly People\\" that makes the novel.  Obviously, I'm not going to reveal it, but Williams' ability to tap into the best in dystopian fiction, to grasp firmly that most modern of fears, the loss of freedom, and then turn them on end is remarkable.  I cannot recall having ever been so surprised, or satisfied by a story's conclusion.  Williams, in his remarkable ability to explore the human capacity for survival, in the end consider what makes us so resilient as a species.  The question is, is it the power of our imagination; the ability to conceptualize something better than what we have?  Or, is it our ability to deceive and manipulate others to advance our own agenda?<br />\\"Nearly People\\" was my first encounter with Conrad Williams, but it will most certainly not be my last.  I am quite simply in awe of his ability to explore something as fundamental and complex as the human spirit in such a short novel, and to succeed so admirably.  As I mentioned above, tracking down \\"Nearly Human\\" may require more effort than the typical book, but the payoff is more than proportional.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-10-25
US	48242885	RM00YCWR91VXS	0743220331	859142656	The Separation	Books	5	25	31	N	N	An enigma wrapped in a riddle; the ideal alternate history	Christopher Priest's \\"The Separation\\" breaks from the standard Alternate History templates in almost every way possible, and as a result, is superb addition to the genre.  I say this because unlike most alternate histories, which focus on story (specifically timeline) to the exclusion of plot and character development, Priest has taken the opposite approach and written a novel that explores ideas and reality within the framework of an alternate history.  His world is a tool (albeit a fascinating, well realized one) used to highlight certain salient elements of his narrative.  Moreover, Priest leaves his world ambiguous and oddly uncertain.<br />This uncertainty begins with the opening pages of the novel, which at first strike the reader as relatively standard alternate history.  It is the early twenty-first century in a world where Britain and Germany signed an armistice in the spring of 1941.  Priest quickly frames a believable alternate world without bogging down in the details, and the novel seems set to follow the researches of one Stuart Gratton into the origins of this early peace.  Intriguing yes, but hardly surprising or unique for an alternate history.  However, that quickly changes as Gratton comes into possession of diaries that reveal the story of an RAF bomber pilot, and it quickly becomes clear that these diaries detail the events of our own world.<br />Thus begins a narrative that weaves back and forth across itself.  Through the fascinating lives of J. L. Sawyer, twins who share the same initials, the reader is constantly left wondering what is real and what is imagined.  Considering that the reader actually knows which story is true, this is a remarkable accomplishment, and speaks highly to Priest's substantial abilities as a writer.<br />To delve more deeply into the plot would risk spoiling it, but there are numerous elements to this novel that are worth mentioning.  The first is it's presentation; Priest deftly switches from the third to the first person, and often interjects \\"historical\\" letters and documents to flesh out the narrative. While in less capable hands, this would come across as contrived, here it succeeds nicely in separating the lives of the Sawyer brothers.<br />Which brings us to the literary device of the twins; again, in less capable hands, they could come across as hackneyed, but carefully handled, as they are here, they are an essential and fascinating plot element.  Aside from the broadly recognized, if not fully appreciated, bond between twins, Priest explores even deeper elements.  His twins, despite being two people seem to be bound to only one destiny.  Each has his preferred path, but they are mutually exclusive, and immutable.  This tension, although never explicitly stated or explored, informs the entire novel, and is key to Priest's ability to keep the reader wrong-footed for quite literally the entire novel.<br />Finally, this question of destiny brings us to the book's consideration of reality.  At times Priest seems to verge on the \\"multiverse\\" approach found elsewhere in science fiction; in other words, his world and our own are not exclusive but just two of innumerable possible worlds.  Ultimately, however, he backs away from this approach; while not a proponent of predestination, he views history as a force that can be diverted but never meaningfully altered.  In this specific instance, he uses Hess, Churchill and other real people to illustrate that other outcomes, no matter how strongly desired, aren't plausible in the face personalities, circumstances, etc.  If I am correct in this reading, it has fascinating implications for the entire structure of the book, to the point that in a manner of speaking the book ceases to exist for the characters once it has been read in its entirety.<br />I used the word \\"if\\" above for two reasons; the first is that while I am confident in my reading, I can't state conclusively that I am correct.  The reason for this hesitation is the second reason for using \\"if\\": this entire novel is about \\"ifs\\".  The story crosses back upon itself countless times, and the reader is constantly left to question what is consequential and what is insignificant.  By exploring the alternative paths available, Priest highlights the one that actually was followed to great effect; it is easy to assume that the world would have been a better place absent World War II, but what would the implications of such a peace have been?<br />Blending elements of convergent and divergent history, not to mention secret history, Priest has produced a remarkable novel.  His world is tremendously detailed without being overly expository, and his writing posits a host of intriguing questions.  Where \\"The Separation\\" truly shines though is in its consideration of our humanity.  Priest uses his world to explore our hopes, aspirations and desires.  Moreover, by deliberately fracturing and blurring the narrative, he calls into question reality itself even as he brings into stark relief the implications of our actions.  A novel rich in ideas, beautifully conceived, superbly executed and brilliantly written, \\"The Separation\\" is not to be missed.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-10-21
US	48242885	R3I6NBHVV0K4UH	0385503857	264457638	Oryx and Crake: A Novel (Atwood, Margaret Eleanor)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Complex, entertaining novel	\\"Oryx and Crake\\" is post-apocalyptic fiction in the finest Cold War tradition; while cautionary, it doesn't lecture, and it entertains even as it offers glimpses of something deeper.  Set in the not too distant future (roughly the late 21st century), \\"Oryx and Crake\\" starts off as the rather traditional narrative of the \\"last man on earth\\", in this case Snowman (a.k.a. Jimmy) the slightly addled but utterly sympathetic main character.  However, it is quickly set apart by the introduction of the \\"Crakers\\" genetically engineered hominids that are true herbivores, and from whom most of the trappings of society have been stripped (art, government, religion, etc.).  <br />Thus, instead of humanity hanging on a knife's edge, it instead stands to be gently shoved aside by the benign, but perfectly adapted Crakers.  By using the power of genetics, Atwood is able to turn the classic \\"what if a manmade killer virus got loose?\\" question on end by changing it into, \\"what if someone decided to willfully destroy the human race in order to make room for something better?\\"  In this case, the eponymous Crake is a thoroughly brilliant scientist, with dire, if not altogether sinister motives.  The boyhood friend of Snowman, he presents an utterly logical façade, even to the point of implying that the planet would be better off without humans.  Finally, there is Oryx, who is in many ways a total mystery.  While definitely a real person, her history is revealed entirely through Snowman, and it is unclear if it is a reflection of his own emotional issues, or actual fact.  In either case, she, along with Snowman and Crake form a quite unintentional holy trinity for the Crakers.<br />The book is arranged in more or less alternating chapters with one set in the present and the other set in Jimmy/Snowman's past.  As such, the plot is only fully revealed at the book's conclusion, and I am therefore reluctant to offer much more in the way of a synopsis.  That said, there are some elements I can comment on generally without offering any spoilers.  The first is that Atwood's writing perfectly suits her subject matter; the rather spare prose of the present tense mirrors the newly emptied world and the simple lives of the Crakers.  At the same time, the flashback chapters are intense and descriptive, nicely matching the frenetic waning years of Homo sapiens sapiens.<br />Moreover, Atwood offers just the right amount of descriptive elements for her new world; all too often post-apocalyptic literature bogs down in scene setting, forsaking character development.  Fortunately, Atwood wisely offers enough detail to create a fully realized world, but not so much that it cripples the novel's pacing.  At the same time the lack of significant temporal or geographic settings allows the reader's imagination significant leeway, which makes the book much more personal in its impact.<br />Finally, Atwood offers a fascinating exploration of humanity as a concept rather than a collection of human beings.  She poses numerous questions that range from the moral, for example, is it ethical to make a decision you are certain is right if the outcome deprives others of their freedom of choice?  To the anthropological, for example, does the belief in the unknown, the spirtual, God, or what have you, fulfill a fundamental and necessary requirement of any intelligent animal?    Like all good authors, Atwood offers hints as to her own feelings, but doesn't presume to offer answers.<br />In the end \\"Oryx and Crake\\" represent the ideal form of science fiction: the use of a place distant from our own both temporally and technologically in order to offer insight into our own lives.  Atwood has succeeded admirably that is entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time.  She tackles issues that cut to the core of who we are as a species, but never bogs down in high-blown exposition.  Finally, her thoroughly enigmatic conclusion leaves plenty for the reader to mull upon, and dependingupon how it is interpreted, significantly different conclusions about Atwood's message can be drawn.  Enaging, fascinating and entertaining, \\"Oryx and Crake\\" is well deserving of the numerous literary accolades it has received.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-10-14
US	48242885	RFDU7NI066KKU	0871138719	645788960	The Zanzibar Chest: A Story of Life, Love, and Death in Foreign Lands	Books	4	38	39	N	N	A vivid portrait of Africa in transition	\\"The Zanzibar Chest\\" by Aidan Hartley is a beautifully written memoir of one man's Africa; from the depths of human depravity to the joy of a life lived simply and well.  As the child of a British colonial officer, Hartley witnessed firsthand the remarkable changes that Africa has undergone in the latter half of the twentieth century.  During his youth his ideal Africa is formed by his father's vision of the continent as a pastoral paradise, and it is through his father that his abiding love of Africa is established.  However, as a reporter for Reuters, he has a front row seat to the periodic paroxysms of violence and disease that plague the continent.  This dichotomy comes to manifest itself in Hartley himself, as he becomes an adrenaline junkie who, even as he craves the comfort of his native Kenya, is drawn to the brutality of Somalia and Rwanda.<br />In addition to being autobiographical, Hartley attempts to weave in the tale of his father's long deceased best friend, Peter Davey, into his narrative.  While interesting in and of itself, this diversion never succeeds in tying in to the main body of the work.  Hartley struggles valiantly to draw a comparison between himself and Davey, but the links are tenuous at best.  In the end, the reader is left with the indication that if Hartley had been born fifty years earlier, he would have become a man like Davey, but this is a conclusion that is hardly supported by what is revealed about both men.  Nonetheless, as I alluded to above, Davey's tale is an intriguing one, and while it is oddly disconnected from the rest of the book, it is still an interesting tale.<br />That said, where the book really shines is in Hartley's descriptions of his life as a journalist.  An immensely gifted writer, Hartley succeeds in producing prose that is both descriptive and spare at the same time.  Considering his subject matter that is exactly what was called for; the brutality of the Rwandan civil war in large part speaks for itself, Hartley thus generally confines himself to bearing witness.  However, when he does offer a more personal view, it is always well chosen to distill an abomination into a single mental snapshot.  For example, his description of finding a young boy alive in a mass grave captures the tragedy of central Africa far more effectively than a hundred pages of focused history.<br />Perhaps most compelling, however, is when Hartley turns his considerable talents to introspection.  Unlike many combat reporters, he openly admits that he is drawn to the violence.  It is clear that this is because Hartley can drown his own demons in the day to day danger and tragedy of combat; it strips away humanity even as it makes relationships all the more intense.  Hartley describes how friendships sealed in blood seem oddly stilted and uncomfortable when the danger is removed.  Particularly interesting is Hartley's relationship with a female photographer.  While there is no doubt that they share a genuine love, it is utterly ruined by their shared experiences.  What is necessary under fire seems contrived and selfish in the safety of home.<br />Finally, there is the piece that links everything together, Hartley's telling of his family history, and how they came to Africa.  This remarkable tale of Britons from the colonial era offers a unique insight into the oddly disconnected lives of white Africans.  No longer Europeans, but not Africans, and no loner in power, their struggle to come to grips with their place in the world parallels Hartley's struggle to reconcile the idealized Africa of his youth with the troubled continent of his present.  Moreover, Africa itself is revealed by this history, as we see a continent forced into a mold determined by colonial powers, only to explode into a third, much worse, form at the end of colonial era.  Nonetheless, Hartley sees hope in the warmth and beauty of the land and its people.<br />In \\"The Zanzibar Chest\\" Hartley has produced a memoir of remarkablepower.  It is a work of both despair and hope, but ultimately one of catharsis, as revealed by the afterward.  While sometimes lacking in focus, the book is more than redeemed by Hartley's superb prose and keen eye.  It offers keen insight into an often overlooked region, and a fresh perspective on situations that are only vaguely understood in the West.  More than that though, it is one man's coming of age in a place of beauty and danger; evocative and engaging, it is not to be missed.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-09-30
US	48242885	R3CLOOPQQ14OM5	1892389614	434824188	Veniss Underground	Books	5	28	31	N	N	Dark, modern myth	In \\"Veniss Underground\\" Jeff VanderMeer has produced a fascinating retelling of the underworld mythology that so riddles our collective subconscious.  Although clearly inspired by Dante and the myth of Orpheus and Euridcye, there is also a more primal, basic undercurrent that infuses his work.  Specifically, it is the divine, yet flawed spark that inhabits each human being; the desire to exercise god-like powers even though we must inevitably pass our own shortcomings into any creation.<br />Set in the future, one's instinct is to read \\"Veniss Underground\\" as science fiction, but to do so would mean missing something very fundamental at work.  In reality, the novel is set in the future because it allows VanderMeer the freedom to use certain plot devices to propel his story forward.  However, the real power of the novel comes from its exploration of our humanity.  <br />That said, his future is a fascinating construct: set in a world where each city has become a power unto itself, surrounded by impassable wastelands of human creation.  In this regard, VanderMeer again harkens back to mythology, as Athens and the like were beacons in a strange, dangerous world.  Veniss is a city where genetically engineered meerkats talk and act as servants, and where walking, breathing Ganesha's  provide security and courier services.  Moreover, the city itself is a marvel, a world unto itself.  However, Veniss is coming unglued, and it is all its fragmented leadership can do to keep it together.  Moreover, Veniss survives because of the Underground, a sort of slum where untold thousands live out their lives in a kind of indentured servitude, hoping only to escape their all to literal hell.  To say more, would give away too much, but the resonances VanderMeer has created with our shared histories should be somewhat clear from this overview.<br />Stylistically, \\"Veniss Underground\\" is arranged in a manner that seems almost pretentious at first, but actually proves to be quite effective.  The novel is divided into three sections, each devoted to three of the main characters.  The first is told in the first person by Nicholas, the instigator of the book's plot, but perhaps the least important character.  His voice is that of our most base instincts as humans; he is selfish, utterly self absorbed, and short sighted.  As such, the first person is the perfect choice, as we can all see ourselves reflected in his failures.<br />The second section is to told in the second person, which was difficult to adapt to, but nonetheless perfectly chosen.  The reason for this is that Nicola, Nicholas' sister, is the purest aspect of a horribly twisted world.  While she is ultimately no better than anyone else, she is placed on a pedestal by the use of the second person, and thus becomes objectified as what one aspires to be, or to posses.  Nicola's voice is both the most enigmatic and the most effective because she is held above and apart from the fray, even as it swirls around her.<br />Finally, there is the third section which uses the conventional third person to narrate the events of Shadrach, Nicola's one time lover.  His is a section of action, of deeds, and as such he is almost outside his own control (certainly his normal behavior) and is therefore the perfect vehicle for third person narration.  As Shadrach descends into ever greater horror, his humanity is stripped away and he becomes literally an avatar for the progression of the story.  It is only when he returns to the surface that he regains some semblance of self control.<br />What then of the true protagonist, the \\"bioneer\\" Quin, who created those remarkable meerkats and much darker things?  He is barely glimpsed in person, but VanderMeer lets Quin's creatures tell his story for him.  In much the same way that one could say a human's love is a reflection of God, even as his failings are a reflection of his humanity, so too are Quin's creatures' capriciousness and aloofness a reflection of their creator, even as their pathos is a reflection of something beyond Quin's control.  Ultimately, Quin aspires to be godhead, but is brought low by the fundamental tendency to entropy that must remain forever outside his control.  In this aspect he is less reminiscent of a mythological figure than he is of Kurtz of \\"Heart of Darkness\\"/\\"Apocalypse Now\\" fame.<br />Jeff VanderMeer has created a novel that plums the depth of depravity and horror in a way that neither Dante nor Conrad could ever have conceived.  Unlike them however, he finds redemption and beauty at the very nadir of human endeavor.  While the fate and purpose of Quin's creations is at best an enigma, the conclusion can only be seen as one of hope; that there is something fundamentally good in our species that will hold back, and eventually triumph over, our own worst creations.  Brilliantly conceived and superbly executed, this is a novel that represents the best in writing today and is not to be missed.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-09-01
US	48242885	R3HHSVNAGF3AW7	0966896882	327081581	City of Saints and Madmen	Books	5	14	19	N	N	Perfectly realized body of work	Its difficult to know where to begin describing Jeff VanderMeer's remarkable \\"City of Saints and Madmen\\"; with it's interweaving plot lines cutting across stories, one is never sure where one section begins and another leaves off.  Moreover, the world of Ambergris is so fully realized, and yet so willfully fanciful, one can never quite find one's footing.  In the hands of a less skilled writer, all of this would add up to a bizarre mish-mash, but VanderMeer somehow weaves it together into one unified work.<br />Moreover, this is a book for booklovers; the arrangement is a work of art in and of itself.  The use of fonts, illustrations, footnotes, even the binding adds to the illusion.  The cover itself is remarkable, as it contains both a short story and a hilarious fictional biography of the author.  VanderMeer and his publisher have succeeded admirably in creating a volume that harkens to an era when books were not only repositories of writing, but valuable for what surrounded the writing.<br />And what writing it is!  VanderMeer flashes descriptive powers that border on the hallucinogenic; the pages absolutely drip with the essence of Ambergris.  From the giant squid that inhabit the River Moth, to the serenely vicious Grey Caps, the author has produced a world that is both bizarrely foreign and completely believable at the same time.  One of the keys to this success is VanderMeer's wise decision to left some things unsaid; for every piece of information about Ambergris that he doles out, he holds back ten, leaving the reader craving more, but also making his world believable because of its very complexity.  In this regard (at least), he is the equal of China Mieville, who has likewise created a world that is both foreign and familiar.<br />As for the stories themselves, I could spend the entire review on any one of them, but given the constraints of the medium, I'll just touch on some of the highlights.  First off is the cover story, which I mentioned above.  Although necessarily brief, it immediately introduces the reader to VanderMeer's talent with descriptive phrases like \\"muscular water\\".  Moreover, it reveals two key things about VanderMeer's writing.  The first is that while Ambergris may be fanciful, it is still every bit as brutal (and as beautiful) as our own.  The second is VanderMeer's fascinating penchant for self-reference; he seems both fascinated and puzzled by his creation.  The result is a desire to nurture it, but a fear of being defined, or even consumed, by it.<br />Next is \\"Dradin in Love\\" which reveals Ambergris in all its glory and horror.  Detailing the angst of the eponymous Dradin, it is by turns touching and horrifying.  This is by no means a conventional love story; its conclusion questions whether benign illusion is preferable to brutal truth.  As with most of these stories, there are illuminating facts dropped elsewhere in the book, particularly one about Dradin's time as a jungle missionary.<br />Next is a fictional history that details the founding of Ambergris and which is perhaps my favorite story.  It is incredibly detailed, richly textured and deftly written.  VanderMeer uses this \\"historical\\" approach to write a story that is maddeningly incomplete, yet which provides the foundation for much of the rest of the book.<br />After that is \\"The Transformation of Martin Lake\\" which is perhaps the strongest story in terms of message.  In it, VanderMeer seems to be commenting on the futility of not just criticism, but history itself.  Essentially, since all human action is informed by the mind, and since the mind of another is inherently unknowable, there is a sort of transitive effect whereby all human action, and hence history, is at best a confused muddle.  At worst, it is either an ignorant or willful sham perpetrated by those with an agenda or those too stupid to interpret even the limited snapshot into other lives that we are granted.<br />The second half of the book falls under the bailiwick of \\"The Strange Case of Mr. X\\" which is an account of VanderMeer's stay in an Ambergrisian mental hospital.  It sounds horribly contrived, but VanderMeer pulls it off nicely.  Each story in this latter half is ostensibly an item found in the author's cell after his puzzling disappearance.  But far from being distinct, they rather from a whole that can only be appreciated once one has read all the way through them.<br />They range from an hysterical monograph on the King Squid that inhabit the River Moth to an encoded story.  What they all have in common is a bizarre symbiosis that offers insight into each story at the most surprising moments.  For example, the aforementioned squid study rewards the reader of the footnotes with a rather poignant glimpse at the \\"author's\\" life.  Likewise, the coded story isn't just a gimmick; the rather gruesome circumstances of its origin mandate a brutal decoding that mirror the words revealed on the page.<br />In the end, there's not much more that I can except that \\"City of Saints and Madmen\\" is not only one of the most beautifully rendered books I have encountered, but one of the most supremely written.  Not since reading Bradbury's collections of short stories have I encountered a collection that feeds off itself so effectively.  It reads like a novel even as it sucks the reader into maddeningly brief glimpses of Ambergris.  This is a must read, and ranks at the top of the list of books I've read in the last year.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-08-30
US	48242885	R1CS9365DONNVV	0415266718	737092943	The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870–1871	Books	4	27	29	N	Y	Military history as it should be written	The Franco-Prussian War is an unusual conflict in that it is in many ways a study in contrasts.  Historically, it set the stage for two twentieth century conflagrations even as it settled scores from the early nineteenth century.  Politically, it marked the zenith of French national influence, and the ascendancy of a united German power.  Finally, militarily, it offered the first widespread use of breech-loading rifles and modern artillery, even as it often languished in the tactics of an earlier age.<br />It takes a broad brush to capture all of these elements, and in this book, Michael Howard has succeeded admirably.  He has taken an often overlooked conflict and placed it squarely at the crossroads of modern Europe, and a new, more terrible type of war.  For while the American Civil War (or even the Crimean War) is often referred to as the first modern war, it is in fact in the Franco-Prussian War that we see all the key elements of modern warfare: national mobilization, citizen soldiers under the guidance of a professional general staff, and the ascendancy of industrialization in both transport and new, more destructive, weapons.  At the same time, newer, more insidious developments in the form of guerrilla warfare and the targeting of civilians centers for strategic reasons first make their appearance on a large scale.<br />Arising out of French objections to the Prussian selection of the Spanish monarch, this war, like many before and since, arose out of a complete lack of French appreciation for the changes that had overtaken the battlefield.  While the French had relied on a small, professional army, the Prussians had adopted a model of mandatory service that allowed them to raise massive, reasonably competent forces with unprecedented speed.  Thus, when hostilities broke out the French, who had assumed an easy victory, were caught on their heels and never regained the initiative.<br />Thus from the summer of 1870 through the depths of winter and into 1871, the story of the Franco-Prussian War is the story of the courage of the French soldier being failed utterly by inept leadership.  It wasn't in the strength of Prussian arms, or in the courage of its soldiers that the war was won; rather, it was in the ability of the centralized Prussian command structure to adapt rapidly to events when their French counterparts were still in the dark that victory was secured.<br />Thus, while Howard's writing on the actual combat is vivid, it is in his appreciation of the fundamentally new Prussian way of war that he is most successful.  From the king, through the Bismarck and Moltke, and on down through the rest of the senior command, he paints a vivid portrait of Prussian ideals and ambition.  Conversely, he is equally successful at capturing the decrepitude and ineptness of a fragmented French government that lost the war in its opening days, and then prolonged it, to the never ending suffering of its soldiers, long after all hope was lost.  Likewise along these lines, Howard nicely illustrates the increasing conflict that inevitable comes between politicians and the military in an era of total war.<br />That said, I do have a few minor complaints.  The first is that Howard almost never translates quotes from the original French or German, and while I was just barely able to muddle through with what I remember from high school and college, any one who hasn't been exposed to these languages would certainly be frustrated.  Secondly, as anyone familiar with European politics knows, nothing happens in a vacuum, and yet Howard spends precious little time discussing the implications of the conflict within the international system of the time.  Finally, while Howard offers many maps, they offer little to know information about troop positions and lines of march, which leaves the reader flipping back rather than digesting a detailed map at a glance.<br />However, these are minor complaints about an otherwise eminently successful work.  Howard has packed a tremendous amount of research into a readable and digestible volume.  His appreciation of the politics and personalities is matched only by his understanding of the weapons of war and the nature of combat.  Not only is this a successful history of the Franco-Prussian war, but also a model of what good history writing should be: balanced, well researched, and above all, readable.  Finally, Howard's success elevates the Franco-Prussian War to its rightful significance as one of the root causes of the tensions that led to WWI, and hence, to WWII.  Thus the student of history should appreciate this work not just for its success in considering immediate events, but for providing a bridge from the Great Power politics of the nineteenth century to the wars of the twentieth.<br />Jake Mohlmanoward has packed a tremendous amount of research into a readable and digestible volume.

US	48242885	R4XD35HZBUPC4	0929398904	623176864	Death Is Lighter than a Feather	Books	5	26	26	N	Y	Accurate alternate history, compelling fiction	In the alternate history genre, David Westheimer's \\"Death is Lighter than a Feather\\" is relatively obscure, which is a shame because it is among the most accurate, well-written offerings available.  In detailing the events of an American invasion of Japan in the absence of the use of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Westheimer shows a firm grasp of strategy, tactics, weapons and geography.  However, unlike many alternate histories that focus on the military to the exclusion of all else, Westheimer has simultaneously produced a rich novel full of fascinating characters that truly captures the fundamental essences of the Japanese and Americans, as well as war in general.<br />Westheimer begins with a prologue that deftly weaves actual events into a world in which nuclear bombs are never brought to bear.  Written in the manner of a history text, it quite effectively conveys the events and players that dictated the course of events without bogging down the fiction reader in historical minutia.  At the same time, the matter of fact transition from reality to fiction sets the stage quite nicely for the heart of the novel.<br />Rather than attempting to follow a primary cast of characters through the entirety of the novel, Westheimer has instead strung together snapshots of the lives of average people on both sides of the fighting; an American frogman, a Japanese colonel, a young Japanese girl, an American Marine, etc.  The only link between chapters is the occasional return to the history book approach of the prologue in order to detail the larger course of events, and set the tone for the next chapter.  In less capable hands, this approach could make for a disjointed reading experience but Westheimer effectively carries through common thematic elements that allow him to cover an array of experiences and concepts without destroying the flow of the novel.<br />First and foremost among these elements is Westheimer's focus on the common man or woman.  By and large, the big power brokers are completely absent.  Neither MacArthur nor the Emperor (nor any of his generals) makes an appearance after the prologue.  Instead, Westheimer focuses on low ranking officers, and even more so, on enlisted personal.  The overall effect of this approach is a ground level view of the fighting that compliments the big picture portions of the text.  At the same time, this close-in approach allows Westheimer to consider issues that would be discordant with a book focused on grand strategy.  For example, the author considers a Marine who becomes convinced that he is killing the same Japanese soldier over and over again.  Westheimer forces the reader to consider whether this is due to shellshock, or if it is a way of rationalizing the horror of killing one's fellow man.<br />Which brings me to another fascinating element of this novel: Westheimer's intuitive understanding of the causes of war, and particularly, the mindset of the American soldier.  His ability to capture what unremitting hatred does to the Japanese, and the consequences that it has on the American soldier is remarkable.  His writing is made even more profound in the light of 9/11 and our recent war against Iraq as he eloquently captures the motivation for fanatical, even suicidal, resistance, and the conflict that resistance causes in American soldiers who are at heart disinclined to kill unless it is absolutely necessary.<br />That said, Westheimer doesn't limit himself to consideration of combatants.  His chapter covering a day in the life of a chaplain's assistant perfectly illustrates the contradictory nature of war in general, and the almost perverse naiveté with which America sometimes goes to war.  At the same time, his descriptions of ordinary Japanese citizens, particularly women, and the dichotomy of what they see versus what they are told is superbly handled.  Westheimer considers what it would be like to live in a world where the \\"divine\\" word of the Emperor is at directodds with what one sees in their everyday life.<br />Ultimately, Westheimer has produced in \\"Death is Lighter Than a Feather\\" the rare alternate history that is historically accurate even as it is good fiction.  From his descriptions of the ferocity of hand-to-hand combat, to the serenity of two lovers in a bamboo grove, the author displays a talent that is rare in authors of any genre.  At the same time, he successfully ties these fascinating snapshots into a larger picture.  Westheimer writes with authority on the invasion that never was, but he also considers war in general, and given the world in which we live, where kamikaze attacks have once again become the norm, it is perhaps more pertinent today then ever.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-06-29

Generally speaking, \\"Still Life With Crows\\" lives up to those expectations, but the ending unfortunately falls short, and the resolution leaves some troubling holes.  That's not to say this is a bad novel, but fans of the authors may find that it doesn't quite live up to their expectations.<br />Set in a small town in Kansas, \\"Still Life With Crows\\" has a creepy vibe from the very beginning that the authors superbly develop over the first two hundred pages.  All too often, novels set in small towns are replete with stereotypes that detract from the story.  Preston and Child, however, have written their best characters yet as they capture the full spectrum of small town Americana.  From the sheriff is a wonderfully complex character who brilliantly plays the part of a typical rural sheriff even as he masks a deeper, more thoughtful man, to the aging local newspaperman, who is no less sophisticated than his big city counterparts, the authors weave a tapestry that draws the reader in.<br />At the same time, Preston and Child exercise their considerable gifts for descriptive writing.  Their ability to capture the still, oppressive heat of the plains and to imbue sprawling cornfields with a latent menace is admirable.  Moreover, as the town of Medicine Creek falls prey to a murderous rampage, the authors create their most genuinely scary settings since \\"Relic\\".  The murders are performed in an oddly ritualistic fashion that haunts the town even as they defy explanation by traditional means.<br />Thus, it is no surprise that the authors call upon their familiar protagonist, Special Agent Pendergast to save the day.  The difference this time is that he plays a larger role in this book than in any of his prior appearances.  Thus, it is up to the authors to develop himto a much greater extent, and they do so quite successfully.  It would be regrettable, but not surprising, if Pendergast took on an almost superhuman aura, considering the huge variety of his considerable faculties.  Fortunately, Preston and Child have made him a true Renaissance man, but a man nonetheless; he is not superhuman, and has human flaws and frailties just like anyone else.  At the same time, the authors have filled his background with mystery and regret that add to his personal legend even as they reveal other information.  Thus, after four books, Pendergast is both better developed and more mysterious than he was when he first appeared in \\"Relic\\" which is no mean accomplishment.<br />The other difference with Pendergast this time around is that he takes on an assistant in the form of a local misfit teenager, Corrie.  While this may sound horribly hackneyed, it was actually quite effective, and her development and the relationship with Pendergast were both well executed.  In fact, I would go so far to as to say that Corrie is one their best character's to date, and the rare well written teenager (authors all too often get stuck in stereotypes when writing adolescents).<br />Unfortunately, all of this excellent stage setting and character development falls somewhat flat in the end.  As the murders become more bizarre, and Medicine Creek teeters on the brink of oblivion, it is obvious that there is something unprecedented happening, possibly something that is tied to an Indian massacre in the 1870's.  As the characters run down blind allies, fracture and then come together in the caves honeycombing the county, the reader is drawn into a nightmare scenario that is impossible to put down.  However, when the climax is finally reached, it is too convenient at best, and it leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  For example the source of the killer's preternatural strength and speed is hinted at, but never answered effectively, and the bizarre tableaus are addressed, but in a manner that seems contradictory to other information about the killer.  My final complaint is that there are two or three chapters that reference events from \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\", and hint at an upcoming sequel, that are nothing but marketing.  They add nothing to the story, in fact they distract from it, and they serve only to allude to future plotlines.  I'm honestly surprised that an editor would let them through, and I hope this isn't a trend for authors whom I've come to respect.<br />\\"Still Life With Crows\\" isn't a bad book, in fact most of it is quite good.  As I alluded to above, the authors' writing, and particularly their characterizations, continue to improve with each novel.  Moreover, with this novel they have proven themselves masters of ambiance, as they deftly ratchet up the pressure and sense of ominous foreboding.  Nonetheless, a book must be judged as a whole, and the conclusion of this one just isn't up to what I've come to expect from these authors.  Is it awful?  No, not by a mile.  Did I enjoy reading it?  Yes, and it's much better than most popular fiction you're likely to find.  Did it live up to the high expectations I have for Preston and Child?  Unfortunately no; one of the reasons why Preston and Child are among my favorite authors is because their plot twists inevitably lead in completely unexpected directions.  And while their twists are better than ever in \\"Still Life With Crows\\", their denouement leaves something to be desired.  This one is worth reading, but not their best.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-06-23

Douglas Keeney is actually a briefly declassified copy of the \\"Emergency Plans Book\\", a high level consideration of the challenges facing the U.S. in a post nuclear strike world, published in 1958.  Along with Keeney's extensive footnoting (on opposite pages to the original text) and an excellent introduction by Stephen I. Schwartz, that is the extent of the book; thus, those reviewers who have argued that this book is dry are correct, although I would argue that their focus is incorrect.<br />Keeney's primary purpose in \\"The Doomsday Scenario\\" was to make available to the public a fascinating snapshot of how the government viewed the prospects for survival in a nuclear war as the Cold War approached its height (although, ironically, 1958 was a time when the U.S. actually had legitimate first-strike capability).  As such, his notes are largely contextual (he also includes some excellent pictures of test shots, which effectively convey the destruction being so baldly stated in the document) rather than opinion or conjecture.  Hence, if you are looking for a fleshed out portrait of a individual survival after a nuclear war, I would recommend fiction such as \\"Alas, Babylon\\", \\"On the Beach\\" or \\"The Last Ship\\".  However, if you are interested in Cold War history in general, \\"The Doomsday Scenario\\" offers a superb primary reference, and nicely frames the nuclear strategy of the following thirty years.<br />As for the text itself, the document covers quite thoroughly (albeit at a high level) all of the military and societal implications of a nuclear war.  Among the items considered are casualties, accessibility to medical facilities, economic consequences, food production, transportation and communication.  Surprisingly, the government is rather bleak in its assessment and takes a worst case view in most instances.  That's not to say that they were wrong to do so, but American's have become accustomed to the positive spin-doctoring of their elected officials, and it was a little odd to see the fact being so plainly stated.  Although brief, there are still more points than I could consider in a review, but there were a few aspects of the document that I (and the author) found intriguing.  Specifically, although chemical and biological weapons are never considered at length, nuclear weapons are explicitly only part of a suite of WMD's that the U.S. anticipated the Russians using.  It is noteworthy that the government anticipated outbreaks of Yellow Fever, smallpox, cholera and even plague within a few weeks of an attack.  While the breakdown of medical services would account for some of this, there seems to be a darker consideration underlying this assessment.  At the same time, the plan explicitly considers sabotage (e.g. terrorism) playing a significant role in any Soviet strike.<br />Which brings me to my one complaint about this book: all to often Keeney draws comparisons to 9/11.  While 9/11 was certainly awful, it pales in comparison to a nuclear strike, and while some of his comparisons are valid (strain on the communications network being one) all to often he assumes that the U.S. could rebound from 50 million casualties in the same way it did from a few thousand.  There's just not much common ground between these two events, and while I believe Keeney is sincere, repeated analogies with no foundation in reality begin to smack of exploitation.<br />Ultimately, this is a book that will be best appreciated by those interested in the Cold War as a whole.  As I mentioned early, this work is best utilized when it provides context and insight for other aspects of the struggle between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.  While dry, the original document is fascinating in and of itself, and in spite of my complaint above, Keeney generally provides valuable insight into what the document is really saying.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-06-14
US	48242885	R382C2K5E1CEE4	1902880307	507114589	The Human Front	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Fascinating blend of genres and ideas	First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors. Specifically, \\"The Human Front\\" was limited to 400 hardcover and another 500 paperback copies, all of which have long since sold out from the publisher. That said, there are copies available on the internet, and fans of alternate history will definitely want to track this one down.<br />As I alluded to above, \\"The Human Front\\" is Ken MacLeod's take on alternate history, but anyone who knows MacLeod knows it will be anything but conventional. Actually, it does start off conventionally enough: it's the early 1960's and World War III has been raging with varying degrees of ferocity since 1949. Joe Stalin is a romanticized guerrilla fighter in the model of Che, and the Soviet Union has been beaten down to the point where the allies have installed a government in Petrograd.<br />Macleod rather cleverly juxtaposes roles in this world; in addition to Stalin, JFK is reviled as a butcher (\\"Hey, Hey, JFK, how many kids have you killed today?\\"). By so doing, he obliterates the myths of the past, and rather shrewdly, points out that historical interpretation is largely a function of the circumstances in which one lives, or more simply, a result of how the past turned out. While he is no apologist for Stalin (by any stretch) he creates a plausible reality where he is revered as a pragmatic, dedicated revolutionary, rather than reviled as a butcher. Thus removed from our known context he can create an absurd inversion that nonetheless sheds light on how we view our own heroes.<br />However, instead of following this believable alternate reality to a logical conclusion, MacLeod throws a curveball in the main character, John Matheson's, enigmatic encounter with one of the U.S.'s strange disc shaped bombers. Although the next twenty pages of narrative are fairly conventional, MacLeod has set the stage, and everything thereafter is tainted by this puzzling mystery.<br />To go any further would spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the novel takes numerous bizarre twists before arriving at a fascinating ending. Specifically, unlike most Alternate History, which revels in an outcome discrete from reality, MacLeod attempts to reconcile his world to our own in a manner reminiscent of Philip K. Dick's \\"The Man in the High Castle\\". The mechanism of this reconciliation is completely original without being outlandish, and the statement made is simple but profound. In essence, MacLeod is arguing that we are all victims of circumstance, that, generally speaking, shaping the world's destiny is beyond the individual. Thus, it is left to each of us to live as best we can, in the hopes that the cumulative result is something better than where we started. At the same time, unlike much Alternate History, (and particularly what one would expect from such a politically conscious writer) MacLeod isn't entirely displeased with the path history has taken, and actually seems to find it better than many of the alternatives.<br />MacLeod packs more into the seventy-five pages of \\"The Human Front\\" than most authors do in novels four times as long. He has blended so many genres, I've lost count, and it's almost unfair to categorize it as Alternate History, in spite of the fact that it won the Sidewise Award for best Short Form Alternate History in 2001. Rather, MacLeod created a true SF hybrid, that evokes the best of many different themes. At the same time, he has written a character driven novel that explores some interesting themes around meaning and purpose. Ultimately, this is a work of literature in which the content far surpasses what one might expect from the length.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-06-11
US	48242885	RYCWWRZ1SEFHX	1902880641	628904694	The Tain	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A little masterpiece from Mieville	First off, this isn't a typical Amazon title, rather it is the product of PS Publishing, which puts out limited, signed editions by various science fiction and fantasy authors.  Specifically, \\"The Tain\\" was limited to 300 hardcover and another 500 paperback titles, all of which have long since sold out from the publisher.  That said, there are copies available on the internet, and any fan of quality fiction, but especially those who are fan's of Mieville's, will want to track down a copy for themselves.<br />But tha's enough about the publishing arrangement, what sets \\"The Tain\\" apart is not its packaging, but its fascinating story.  On the simplest level, this is Mieville taking a turn at apocalyptic fiction, but of course its more than that.  Mieville never sees fiction the way one would expect any other author to, and so instead of disease, or nuclear war, the reader is treated to a London ravaged by our escaped reflections.  More accurately, these \\"imagos\\", as Mieville describes them, are beings that operate in entirely different dimensions than our own, but as a result of a war in the long forgotten past, they were imprisoned in mirrors \\"in the tain\\" in any reflective surface.  Thus, they were forced to adapt their essence to our corporeal forms, and as mirrors became more prevalent, their imprisonment became all the more onerous.<br />Some managed to break free into our world, where they killed their reflective twin and moved among us.  Mieville quite cleverly uses the vampire myth here, as they have no reflections and do not die except by violence.  Moreover, they are imbued with the inhuman strength and nature of the imagos, and thus come to act as spies in our midst.  Like the vampire, though, they are always alone, even among there own kind, as they are trapped in the forms they most despise.<br />So that's the gist of the plot, but there's so much more going on.  The story is narrated in alternate chapters by an unnamed vampire, and by Sholl a human who is disconcertingly ignored by all of the imagos.  Both are outsiders in their own way, and both are uncertain as to what is required of them in this new, blighted landscape.  The vampire knows who he is, but not where he belongs or what he should do, and Sholl knows what he must do, but is uncertain as to what he really is.  Thus, the two reflect each other even as they are at odds.  Moreover, there is an inversion of Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\" in that they can move freely among their enemies but are uncertain among their own kind.  While this might seem like a handy trait, it leads to an alienation far more profound than being at war with the rest of the world.<br />At only eighty-nine pages, this is a short story, and to go on any further would risk spoiling critical plot elements.  Suffice it to say that Mieville has put his fingerprint on another genre.  Fans of his work will be struck by how \\"the Tain\\" echoes his prior novels while traveling in completely different paths, and new fans will be introduced to him at his best, utterly unique and masterfully spinning the English language.  While this is a book that will probably only be read by his most devout fans, not least because of its limited accessibility, I would encourage all of those who enjoy insightful literature to track and down and savor it.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-06-08
US	48242885	R3C1N6KKRS04QE	185367530X	883086592	Cold War Hot: Alternate Decisions of the Cold War	Books	5	38	41	N	Y	Generally excellent collection	It is the unfortunate fact of collections of allo-historical scenarios like \\"Cold War Hot\\" (including the \\"What If?\\" books and \\"Virtual History\\") that the tend to be rather uneven in their quality. This is due to the reality that a collection of diverse writers will necessarily have different talents and different focuses which are more or less conducive to the writing of alternate history. That said, \\"Cold War Hot\\" ranks highly among the alternate history collections, and includes some of the best and most original pieces I have encountered.<br />Obviously, \\"Cold War Hot\\" examines various alternate paths that the Cold War could have taken that would have resulted in either combat where there was none, or in a greater, more violent operational tempo. Divided into ten chapters, the book considers every time period from the Berlin Blockade through 1989. It is notable that when compared to other similar collections, the authors generally spend very little time discussing what actually did happen; in fact, other than a \\"what really happened\\" section at the end of each chapter, the content is probably at least eighty percent allo-historical. While this is great for someone well versed in the various Cold War flashpoints, it could be frustrating for someone who has only a vague grasp of twentieth century history, so be forewarned.<br />The first two chapters are probably the weakest; the first deals with an air battle surrounding the Berlin Airlift, and the second with a successfully executed North Korean invasion of South Korea. Aside from the fact that both are rather predictable jumping off points, neither one is fleshed out particularly well and they both end rather abruptly. They aren't terrible, but they're definitely the week spots in this collection.<br />The next scenario somewhat belies the title of the book as it presumes a pacification of Vietnam achieved at a much lower level of violence. While a little bit slower than the other chapters, it is still very well written and posits a thorough and believable alternate path for the Vietnam intervention.<br />Chapters four and eight deal with events in the Middle East; the first around the Six Days War and the latter around the Yom Kippur War. From an operational standpoint, these are probably the two most thorough scenarios, as orders of battle are examined in detail, and armed clashes occur across the breadth of the Mediterranean. While the basis for both scenarios is well established in alternate political histories, it is in the \\"hot\\" aspect that they really shine.<br />Chapters five and six are my two favorites, as they deal with the most esoteric 'what-ifs' in the book. Chapter five in particular is in my experience completely original as it examines the consequences of a violent Quebecois revolution in the late 1960's. As someone who witnessed the relatively peaceful attempts at secession in the late 1990's, this was an eye-opening and thoroughly enjoyable scenario. Chapter six deals with a Soviet invasion of communist China. This is another scenario where the military aspects are thoroughly detailed, and it contains probably the best presentation in terms of fiction versus history. Moreover, this scenario has the added bonus of nukes and chemicals weapons being deployed and used, which only adds to the tension.<br />Chapter seven is another Vietnam scenario, and serves as a nice counterpoint to chapter three, as it deals with the ultimate escalation, an invasion North Vietnam.  This is another chapter that is extremely strong in operational details, and especially order of battle and the deployment of specific units.  Some of the dialogue is a little hackneyed, but overall this is a great chapter.<br />Chapter nine deals with a different outcome for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. While there is some military action, this chapter's focus is primarily in the political realm, and it is largely successful. However, there is one glaring mistake in this chapter: thereis a map which should display forces as \\"Soviet/Indian\\" and \\"Pakistani\\", instead it shows \\"U.S.\\" and \\"Russian\\" which was extremely confusing for a few pages until I picked up on the error.<br />The final chapter I won't even describe briefly as it is completely out of right field, and doing so would spoil it. That's not to say that this is an unbelievable scenario; while tongue is planted firmly in cheek, it is not utterly beyond the realms of possibility, and it was great fun to read.<br />Ultimately, this is a very successful collection, with some genuinely original scenarios, and generally good to excellent writing all around. Each scenario is firmly rooted in history and entirely logical alternate decisions, and each ends up in a very different set of circumstances, which are the two hallmarks of the best alternate history writing. My only complaint (aside from the map error detailed above) is that the editing is sub-par to say the least. There are numerous grammatical errors and incorrect word substitutions that can really break up the flow of the narrative. That said, they don't detract anywhere near enough to avoid reading this otherwise highly enjoyable collection.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-06-01
US	48242885	R1T3SUMT78BJF8	0312230796	93948639	Crimea: The Great Crimean War, 1854-1856	Books	4	23	23	N	Y	Detailed, thoughtful look at a critical point in history	In \\"Crimea: The Great Crimean War 1854 - 1856\\" Trevor Royle has produced a work that is impressive not only for its reporting of the facts surrounding a very muddled war, but also for successfully placing The Crimean War within a greater context of European history.  While perhaps slightly too focused on the British point of view, Royle is nonetheless supremely evenhanded, and does a superb job of capturing the numerous diplomatic subtleties which surrounded the events in the Crimea.<br />Like all successful military histories, Royle's begins well before the years that actually encompass the fighting.  Instead he examines France's (embodied in Napoleon III), desire to climb out of the hole it was left in after Waterloo.  Having been stripped of all influence in Europe, and having lost much of its colonial Empire, France had nonetheless learned valuable lessons in Algeria during the intervening decades.  Moreover, what France lacked in industrialization when compared to Britain, it more than made up for with unabashed ambition.<br />At the same time, Britain was at the peak of a Pax Britannica that would last until 1914.  As such, it was primarily concerned with maintaining the status quo, and protecting the crown jewel of the empire: India.  Thus it came to pass that when Russia used protestations of religious crimes (which were complete pretexts, in spite of their veracity) as a causus belli for war with Turkey, that Britain and France, longstanding adversaries and frequent enemies, were thrust together to preserve an Ottoman Empire that was too caught up in inertia to save itself.  Britain to protect India's fragile northwest frontier, and France to regain some of the luster it had lost<br />The result, of course, was The Crimean War, a bizarre set of misadventures that seemingly accomplished nothing, and yet set the stage for a host of events to come.  Specifically, battlefield necessity saw the invention or adaptation of numerous devices, such as the telegraph,railroad, field hospitals, rifles (as opposed to muskets), sanitation, steam-powered warships etc., many of which are credited to the more famous American Civil War.  As such, the Crimean war can rightfully be argued as the first modern war, and it is therefore well worth studying.  For example, the difficulties that the fractious British-French-Turkish alliance faced are particularly telling in a world where strategies for global collective action are sorely lacking.<br />As for the fighting itself, there were precious few of what one might consider battles, the Alma, Inkerman/Balaklava and the siege of Sevastopol being the notable exceptions.  For the most part this was a war that presaged World War I, with protracted trench fighting in brutal conditions.  Nonetheless, Royle does a good job of setting the stage for the various engagements, including geography, units, commanders and missed opportunities.  In particular, he does a superb job of portraying the senior commanders on all sides in an objective manner.  However, it is in this area that I must make one of my two complaints: there is a serious lack of both quantity and quality when it comes to the maps.  Far too often, I was left referring to other sources in order to follow the battles; most absurdly, there is no map of the Black Sea/Crimean Peninsula until page 375!  Moreover, rather than using detailed topographical maps, Royle elected to use the quaint, vaguely hand drawn maps that anyone who studies military history is familiar with (and abhors).  What they posses in graphic appeal, they more than lose in lack of useful terrain and coordinate information.<br />That said, it is the political intrigue that dominates this book and where Royle is truly in his element.  He deftly captures the various power plays that come to influence the outcome of events, and at the same time provides an even handed running commentary on the skills/deficits of the various players.  Which leads me to my second complaint: the problem is that Royle offers a wealth of information about British decision making, but the step down to France, Russia, Turkey and other associated players is severe.  To be fair, this may be a function of the autocratic leadership in these latter countries, which served to compress the decision making cycle and limit correspondence that would shed light on events.  Nonetheless, I felt that Turkey in particular could have been better rounded out.<br />Finally, Royle quite succinctly places The Crimean War within the context of European conflict up through World War I.  Just as in its tactics the Crimea foreshadowed the events of 1914-1918, so to did the grand strategy of 1854 rear its head sixty years later.  By recognizing this fact, Royle has elevated what might have become a dusty recounting of a largely forgotten war into a superb examination of European (and by extension, world) politics in the ninety-eight years between Waterloo and Franz Ferdinand's assassination.  As such, it work successfully as both military history and political science, and is well worth reading by students of both.<br />Jake Mohlman	2003-05-28
US	48242885	R3SU6EVQDHCP3Y	0399149864	919064525	Pattern Recognition	Books	5	214	232	N	Y	Superb, thought-provoking novel	I feel I should start of by stating that this is my first William Gibson novel, so if you're looking for an evaluation of \\"Pattern Recognition\\" within the context of his other books, there's no point in reading further.  That said, I found \\"Pattern Recognition\\" to be a remarkable, moving novel that was a joy to read.  Specifically, it is a fascinating look at the paranoia and hope of the post 9/11 world.  Gibson deftly considers the difference between crass consumer culture and genuine art, and then swirls them together via our information saturated culture.    As his protagonist, Gibson creates Cayce Pollard, something of a marketing prodigy whose claim to fame is that she can unerringly determine whether or not a brand logo will be successful on first sight.  It is therefore intensely ironic that she has a phobia of all commercial branding that manifests itself through something that is akin to a cross between a panic attack and a migraine.  Her revulsion to consumer culture is so intense, she goes so far as to remove labels from everything she owns, and dresses in the most stripped down manner possible.    Wrapped inside this duality is the additional one that Cayce, despite her odd phobias, who seems to be an inherently  trusting and positive person, is grappling with the death, or more accurately the disappearance of her father in the events surrounding 9/11.  Thus her vision of the future is touched by the background, but pervasive, fear that seems to have become part and parcel to our new century.    Cayce's escape from these twin phantoms is an oddly alluring film that is being released piece by piece on the internet (those familiar with Mark Danielewski's \\"House of Leaves\\" may see an echo here).  The \\"footage\\", as it is known, enjoys a grass roots fascination globally that borders on cultish, except that the reaction is overwhelmingly positive, and disconnected from pop culture.  The footage is apparently being released out of sequence, and seems to take place out of time and in some undefined location.  As chatroom battles rage over whether it is a work in progress or a completed film, there seems to be no argument that the footage is a thing of shocking, pure beauty, totally untainted by popular culture.    However, it is when Cayce is asked by her enigmatic and enormously influential colleague to track the footage to the source that things get weird.  It would be impossible to recount the plot here without spoiling it, but the dualities mentioned above, art and pop-culture, past and future, act, react and interact in fascinating ways.  Gibson argues eloquently that the future is informed by the past, but not determined by it.  Moreover, he seems to be arguing that there is no such thing as consumer-culture or art, but rather that they are all part of one increasingly global CULTURE.  This blurring of the lines is neither good nor bad, but instead a consequence of the Information Age.  As such, the definitions and boundaries of art are shifting.    I could go on, but I suspect that this is the type of novel that allows (and encourages) a multitude of conclusions.   So I will finish by saying that on top of the fascinating, puzzling plot, and the interesting thematic elements, this is also a very cathartic book to read.  While 9/11 plays a relatively small role in terms of lines of text, the horror of that day saturates Cayce, and the themes of the book.  At it's conclusion, however, \\"Pattern Recognition\\" points the way to a release of those emotions, or more accurately of a way to place them within a personal historical context.  Thus, this remarkable novel points to a chance for hope in our troubled brave new world.    Jake Mohlman	2003-05-12
US	48242885	R1YRFSSTSA2FL2	0792263626	96389309	Ghosts of Tsavo: Tracking the Mythic Lions of East Africa	Books	4	27	27	N	Y	Engaging look at unusual lions	\\"Ghosts of Tsavo\\" is part travelogue, part natural history, part murder mystery, and part mid-life crisis for its author Philip Caputo.  What it is as a whole is a fascinating, engaging look at the lions of Tsavo Park in Kenya.  Caputo first became interested in these unusual lions as a result of a visit to the Field Museum in Chicago as a young boy.  Therein were \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Darkness\\" two enormous males lions that terrorized constructions workers building a rail line through Tsavo.  In fact terrorized may be too weak a word as they are credited with killing at least 120 people and literarily halting construction until they were eventually hunted down and killed by British Lt. Col. Patterson who was heading up the project.  He recounted this effort in his famous memoir \\"The Man Eaters of Tsavo\\" and kindled a fascination with Kenya's lions that lingered with Caputo for half a century.    What sets the lions of Tsavo apart from the more familiar ones we know from nature documentaries, is that they are much bigger, and the males are either maneless of have very short manes, in either case nothing like the regal mountains of fur on their cousins from the Serengeti.  In the first half of the book, Caputo explores reasons as to why this might by the case.  It is possible that since Tsavo is much warmer than the Serengeti, manes are too expensive in terms of internal resources to grow.  Another possibility is that the thick scrub brush and thorns of the region wear down manes before they ever become truly impressive.    However, it is a more controversial theory that makes for the most entertaining reading.  Caputo encounters several scientists who argue that the lions of Tsavo are genetically distinct from the lions on the Serengeti.  Moreover, they argue that the lions of Tsavo are in fact a throw back to prehistoric lions, quite literally walking fossils.  The point to the lack of manes, the much larger height and girth and the fact that Tsavo lions hunt the enormous Cape Buffalo as justifications for this thesis.    Ultimately, Caputo, in three journeys to Kenya over the course of eighteen months (once as a tourist and twice with scientific expeditions) is never able to definitively state which hypothesis is correct.  However, that in no way detracts from his rambling, conversational narrative.  Caputo is not a scientist, and he in no way pretends to be one, although he does (and justifiably so) consider himself a well-informed observer.  As such, he is not constrained by the rigors of academia, and can therefore transfer his passion for these lions and the mystery surrounding them onto the page.  In fact, towards the end he grows weary of the scientific studies as they somehow detract from the powerful aura that surrounds the lions.    If you are interested in lions in general, or if the prospect of some spine-tingling tales of man-eating lions sounds appealing, \\"Ghost of Tsavo\\" is well worth reading.  However, beyond the surface elements, Caputo has written a book that captures the raw spirituality of nature, and that bemoans modern man's detachment from the primitive.  So it is entirely likely that even if you have no interest in lions at all, you may be drawn to Caputo's lament for something we don't even realize we have lost.  Either way, \\"Ghost's of Tsavo\\" is well worth reading.    Jake Mohlman	2003-05-09
US	48242885	RPZOJX1V0X9PN	0345448359	532522277	Darwin's Children	Books	3	56	60	N	Y	Good, but the same problems as the first novel	First off, don't even consider reading this novel before reading its predecessor \\"Darwin's Radio\\"; there is simply too much plot and science to attempt to pick up without the benefit of reading the first novel.  Secondly, while there is some serious science discussed in both books, the reader shouldn't feel that a lack of formal biology education will prevent them from understanding and enjoying these books (although it certainly won't hurt).  Bear does an excellent job of working the necessary science into the flow of the narrative, and he even provides a fairly comprehensive glossary at the end of the book.    That said, I found 'Darwin's Children\\" to be every bit as engaging and every bit as frustrating as \\"Darwin's Radio\\".  The premise, that a new branch of human evolution is beginning, is an intriguing one, and the idea of following this new species as it grows to maturity has the potential to be fascinating.  And to a degree, it is; unfortunately, Bear all to frequently takes the reader down literary dead-ends, and makes temporal jumps just when the story is getting interesting.    First the good, though, and there is plenty.  To begin, Bear's characters are a step above the first novel.  That's not to say that the were lacking previously, but the author has taken this opportunity to instill them with a deep pathos that is truly memorable.  The characters, operating under horribly strenuous circumstances represent the full range of human emotion.  Moreover, their philosophies are well defined and realistic; they absolutely fit the situation at hand, and nicely mirror historical precedent.  Secondly, Bear has created a dystopian near future that is all too believable.  He draws nicely on the subtle but pervasive daily fear of the post 9/11 world to create a U.S. that is both terrifyingly different, and yet disturbingly familiar.  While he often where's his politics on his sleeve, Bear does draw nicely on the concern for a potential erosion of our civil liberties in the years to come.  Finally, as I alluded to earlier, Bear does a superb job of incorporating genuinely cutting edge science without bogging down the narrative.  In fact, the scientific dialogue almost becomes a character unto itself, as the reader ponders what revelation will be next.    Unfortunately, all of these elements are let down by rather discordant storytelling.  In a book just under four hundred pages long, Bear has attempted to cover three different time periods separated by six years.  Frankly, this is just too much to attempt in a relatively short novel.  In any given section the pacing and plot lines are excellent, but just when the reader is immersed in the story, it jumps rather jarringly ahead by a few years.  Moreover, critical plot developments are presumed to have taken place in the intervening periods, which is extraordinarily frustrating when one considers how successful Bear is at writing sympathetic characters.  Secondly, there are more than a few blind alleys that left me puzzled.  On more than one occasion Bear seems about to reveal a major plot point, only to back away.  Perhaps other readers will deduce Bear's thinking, but in spite of rereading several sections I haven't been able to ascertain where he was headed.  Finally, there is an odd supernatural/spiritual/religious plot line around one of the main characters.  In and of itself this isn't a bad thing, but it seems oddly out of place with the rest of the story and doesn't really add anything to the novel.    Ultimately \\"Darwin's Children\\" isn't a bad novel, but it could have been much more.  With it's well drawn characters, fascinating plot and superb settings it could have been a great novel.  Unfortunately, Bear bit off more than he could chew in the allotted space.  The end result is a novel that is often fascinating, frequently gripping but in the end, to broken up to be completely successful.  I enjoyed reading it, but I would recommend waiting for the paperback or picking it up at the library rather than investing in the hardcover edition.     Jake Mohlman	2003-05-07
US	48242885	R1B1EZ0C96WYOF	0151006903	99041831	Baudolino	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Fascinating, multi-faceted tale	\\"Baudolino\\" by Umberto Eco is a beguiling novel full of riddles and half-truths.  What begins as a fairly standard, albeit engaging, work of historical fiction, quickly transforms into a work of almost surreal imagination.  Touching upon every imaginable mythos of the Middle Ages, from the Holy Grail to the kingdom of Prester John, to the Old Man of the Mountain and the dimensions of the Earth, Eco has created a travelogue that is completely believable, and yet must be an almost complete fabrication.    The tale is recounted by the eponymous Baudolino, adopted son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick, and by his own admission, something of a ne'er do well.  However, he is also a devoted son, and is determined to do his part to ensure that greater glory of his adoptive father.  After having the legend of Prester John imparted to him by one of Frederick's advisors, Baudolino is convinced of its truth, and moreover is certain that a union with this magisterial Christain kingdom is the perfect way to secure Frederick's glory.  Unfortunately, no proof of this John's kingdom exists, so Baudolino determines to fabricate a letter from Prester John that will prove his existence to Frederick, and which will convince him seek John's kingdom.  There is no shame in this act because Baudolino, being utterly convinced of the truthfulness of his sources, is certain that Frederick will find Prester John.    At this point it seems that \\"Baudolino\\" will in some way be the opposite of Eco's \\"Focault's Pendulum\\".  In this instance, instead of creating truth (or at least a perception of truth) out what were thought to be flights of fancy, Baudolino is striving to create proof of something he believes to exist through a work of pure fiction.  Thus, through the first half of the book, the reader is left with the impression that this will be another secret history.  Furthermore, this suspicion is born out by the fact that the protagonists are constantly inventing \\"holy\\" relics in order to further their respective causes.  This jives with Eco's genteel, but well know, differences with the Catholic Church; his beliefs can only be reinforced by his playful, at will creation of holy relics.    To a point, that may have been Eco's goal, and it is certainly a centerpiece of the novel, but when Baudolino actually sets out in search of Prester John, things become a bit more muddled.  He recounts creatures and places that the 21st century reader knows never existed, so the question then becomes, is Baudolino still lying, or is something deeper at work?  Before I attempt to answer that question I feel I should add that it need not even be approached by the reader.  Eco's creation, while not rooted in fact is utterly engaging and completely believable within the confines of the book.  If one approaches \\"Baudolino\\" as a twelfth century travelogue, and not as the creation of Eco, it can be approached much like the travels of Sinbad, or the tales of King Arthur.    That said, there is plenty of room for conjecture on Eco's writing.  My personal opinion is that \\"Baudolino\\" is doing one of two things, either he is 1. continuing his invention so that he might reflect some glory back on to his beloved Frederick, or 2. his own life is so wrapped up in his fabrication, he cannot separate reality from fiction and remain sane.  Or perhaps both are true and so intertwined as to be unrecognizable.  Certainly, Baudolino's fabricated letter echoes repeatedly throughout the latter half of the book, and it is entirely possible that having failed his father at the end, he feels he has no choice but to transform the fiction into reality.  Alternately, there are strong reflections of Baudolino's greatest regrets in his narrative.  In particular (and without giving anything away) I would point the reader to the similarities to a satyr Baudolino encounters and his premature child.  Whatever his ultimate intention, Baudolino's tale is undeniably imbued with his regrets.    In the end,I suspect that Baudolino has become more comfortable in his invention than he is in reality.  At the end of his life, he has become the lies by which he lived his life; the truth is uncomfortable and doesn't seem to make sense.  When one considers the backdrop of upheaval against which this novel takes place, and Baudolino's supreme love for Frederick, such a state of mind, while deluded, doesn't seem entirely unreadable.    Finally, I would like to add that while \\"Baudolino\\" is as erudite as Eco's other works with which I am familiar (\\"The Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Focault's Pendulum\\") it struck me as much more approachable.  In particular, the verbal gymnastics that made \\"Focault's Pendulum\\" such a dense minefield of puzzles has been abandoned for a much more stylish, stripped down prose.  While Eco still displays his mastery of the written word, no longer does he use three words where one will suffice.    The end result of these elements is a fascinating novel that is both approachable and filled with mystery.  Even as it entertains, \\"Baudolino\\" offers a multitude of avenues to explore between the lines.  I suspect that any ten readers will have ten completely differing interpretations of this novel, but I am equally certain that they will all agree that \\"Baudolino\\" is a wonderful work of literature that is well worth spending time with.

US	48242885	R2592E1YF66ICM	0151008116	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	21	26	N	N	An utterly unique story	Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" is the fascinating story of one Pi Patel, a castaway, stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat...oh, and his only companion is a 450-pound Bengal tiger.  Thus is the stage for this genuinely unique novel.  Couched as a meditation on the nature of God and faith, the novel succeeds more as a straightforward, albeit unusual, story of survival.    Pi, the eponymous main character, is a boy of sixteen who despite being raised in the Hindu tradition of India (or rather around, his parents aren't particularly religious) has come to embrace both Christianity and Islam.  Moreover, his belief in one faith in no way detracts from his faith in the others; rather, he takes the core beliefs of each, and uses them to enhance his understanding of the others.  While this is certainly an unusual arrangement, it is perhaps not as shocking as Martel might have hoped, as the core beliefs of most religions are compassion, charity and faith in the divine.  On the other hand, if he was striving to highlight the absurdity of strife in God's name, he certainly makes a compelling point.    That said, the story, as I alluded to earlier, largely takes place on a lifeboat adrift in the Pacific.  Pi's family were zookeepers, and in the process of moving to Canada, the cargo ship transporting them and their animals sinks, leaving Pi and a tiger by the name of Richard Parker as the only survivors.  What follows are nine months of desperation, filled with small triumphs and journeys to the depths of despair.  Richard Parker is too big and dangerous for Pi to attempt to kill him, so he must find a way to come to an accommodation with this dangerous beast.  To do so, he is forced to call upon all of his experience as a zookeeper's son, while struggling to keep himself alive.    I'm sure that many will find this brief overview of the plot somewhat far-fetched; more of a metaphor than an actual story, I assure you that nothing could be further from the truth.Martel has taken a completely bizarre circumstance, and turned it into something not only believable, but also plausible.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is loaded with events that would be mundane if it weren't for the desperate nature in which they took place, and Pi's struggle for supremacy with the tiger is so pragmatic and deadly serious, any element of the fantastic goes right out the window.    However, as I alluded to earlier, the meditation on religion that Martel was striving for seems to fall short.  There are elements that echo parts of the Bible: a struggle with an unknown stranger (Jacob wrestling God/an angel), blindness and despair (numerous times in the New Testament), and Richard Parker certainly seems to fill an Archangel's duel role of protector and scourge of God.  Moreover, it wouldn't surprise me to find that there are elements from other religions that I an not familiar with.  All that aside, though, Martel never has Pi come to a true crisis of faith, a turning point in which only his faith in God can carry him through.  While Pi has many low moments, his faith in God never seems to waver, and he never calls out in his hour of need.    Of course, this does leave one alternative: that Pi is a modern retelling of the story of Job.  Pi as a pious man (or boy in this instance) who is tormented by God for the sole purpose of testing his faith.  Of course, this doesn't fit in with the traditions that Pi has embraced; the God of the new testament is compassionate, and I am unaware of comparable traditions in Islam or Hinduism (although that doesn't mean they aren't there, I am by no means a religious scholar).  Ultimately, I think Martel is arguing that it is our quiet faith, our steadfast belief in something greater than ourselves, which carries us through in times of trial.  If that was his goal, he succeeded admirably.    Ultimately, these meditations on religions can be treated as completely secondary.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is written with superb pacing, excellent narration and brilliantly conceived characters.  Moreover, the premise is so unique as to be completely different from anything you have encountered before.  Should the reader decide to look deeper, there is plenty to ponder, but it is completely enjoyable if approached solely as an adventure story.  In the end \\"Life of Pi\\" is completely deserving of the praise it has received, and well worth reading.    Jake Mohlman	2003-04-20
US	48242885	R3TLHXEP0HB8Y6	0385334966	539408457	Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World--Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran It	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Chilling	\\"Biohazard\\" by Ken Alibek, is the gripping true story of his life as one of the Soviet Union's elite bioweaponeers.  Alibek traces his assent through the Soviet biowarfare bureaucracy, from his early days as a young doctor to his defection to the United States.  In between he lists a catalog of mankind's greatest scourges: anthrax, smallpox, plague and a host of lesser know agents, and how the Soviets worked to turn them into weapons of horrifying virulence.    Told in a largely chronological fashion (the exception being diversions into Soviet research prior to Alibek's career), \\"Biohazard\\" is more concerned with the \\"how\\" of the program than the \\"what\\".  More specifically, Alibek largely restricts himself to the broad overview of the research, and focuses on the entire bioweapons establishment: where it was located, what it was capable of producing, who its directors were, etc.  As such, anyone with a basic introduction to biology should be able to follow the narrative; however, some high school or introductory college biology would probably enhance one's understanding of just how appalling these weapons are.    Particularly disturbing were Alibek's discussions of efforts to produce \\"chimera\\" weapons; weapons that contain the complete genetic code of two diseases in one cell.  A particularly awful weapon that may or may not have been developed was a combined smallpox/Ebola weapon that combined both diseases while sacrificing the virulence of neither.  One need not be an expert to see that the consequences of such a weapon would be catastrophic.    Moreover, Alibek spends significant time towards the end of the book detailing the possibility for the rise of biowarfare programs in other countries.  He lists Russia, India, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, Libya and Cuba as almost certain participants in this deadly field, and argues strongly that the collapse of the Russian economy makes it almost certain that Russian scientists are selling their expertise to other countries.  Written prior to 9/11, \\"Biohazard\\" is all the more disconcerting because of it.    I have one minor complaint about \\"Biohazard\\".  Specifically, as I alluded to earlier, Alibek doesn't spend much time discussing the symptoms and impact of specific diseases.  For instance, naturally occurring smallpox is (or was) about 30% fatal; but what would be the consequences of a release today into an unvaccinated populace?  Moreover, how much more virulent was the Soviet engineered virus?  I suppose that he may not have wanted to give specifics for fear of encouraging others, but the information is critical if one is to accurately assess the threat of bio-terrorism.     In this day and age, America's first line of defense is information.  In \\"Biohazard\\" Ken Alibek has written a book that goes a long way towards dispelling our benign view of Russian weapons programs.  Moreover, it reinforces the grave threat that rogue states, and by extension terrorists, with weapons of mass destruction pose in the 21st century.  This is a book is well worth reading by anyone who wants to understand the potential pitfalls to peace and security in the decades to come.    Jake Mohlman	2003-04-07
US	48242885	R2MY5N7GZDVLGN	0609608444	517121775	The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Engaging, unique history	In \\"The Devil in the White City\\" Erik Larson has produced a fascinating snapshot of the time surrounding the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.  What makes this book unique, however, is that he has successfully juxtaposed the dazzling success of the fair with the gruesome exploits of a serial killer who haunted its edges.  The end result is a book that captures more than just the fair, or the killer, but rather provides a remarkable look at America at the dawn of the twentieth century.    Larson's narrative follows two interwoven stories in more or less alternating chapters.  One line is that of Daniel Burnham, chief architect of the fair, and a man of immense, and under appreciated vision.  Larson does a superb job of detailing the massive endeavor that Burnham undertook, and the brutally short timeline in which he had to accomplish it.  A man of less ambition would have lost hope in the face of such immense obstacles, but Burnham not only persevered, but also triumphed.  In a mere 22 months, he produced an exhibition that was an architectural triumph, which so dazzled its visitors that they came to call the fair \\"The White City\\".  Moreover, his daring allowed the fair to actually turn a profit, a key victory in America's staunchly capitalist society.    At the same time that Larson describes the triumph of the \\"White City\\" he details the depredations of a man who goes by many names, but who the reader comes to know as Holmes.  In many ways, Holmes was America's answer to Jack the Ripper, but his notoriety faded over time, a victim of the enigmatic nature of his crimes.  While the toll Holmes took is uncertain (from a certain nine victims up to an estimated, and perhaps implausible, 200), it is certain that he set up what was essentially a murder factory in his custom built commercial building/hotel/office.  Complete with soundproof gas chambers and a basement fitted with a crematory, dissection table and acid vats.    While these twin narratives may seem at odds, theyactually compliment each other quite nicely.  Both represent an ideal, opposite ends of a pole, and as a result, the reader is treated to a comprehensive view of the times that represents a whole, both good and bad.  Some reviewers have complained that Larson's narrative digresses into areas not immediately pertinent (menus, news of the day, etc.) and that is true.  However, it is these digressions that allow Larson to capture the true feel of the times; from the muck in the streets to the most exalted banquets, the reader is treated to a fascinating portrait of how people lived.    The end result of all this detail, when combined with Larson's superb, almost conversational, style of writing, is a fascinating, immensely enjoyable book.  \\"The Devil in the White City\\" reads like a novel, but is all the more intriguing because it is true.  Larson has taken a little know murderer, combined him with a slightly better known fair, and produced a fascinating look at the United States 100 years ago.    Jake Mohlman	2003-03-27
US	48242885	R2QEFE73QG7VJ5	0743235355	730119057	Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Brutal, profane,  and brilliant	In \\"Jarhead\\" Anthony Swofford has created a memoir that ranks with \\"Dispatches\\" and \\"My War Gone By, I Miss it So\\".  His brutal honesty, when combined with his superb writing, produces a portrait of war that is both appalling and moving.  Swofford's book isn't one of tactics, weapons and politics; rather, it is one of brotherhood, terror, hope and despair.    While the book isn't written in chronological order, it details (albeit unevenly) Swofford's life from childhood through his enlistment in the Marines and the years following the Gulf War.  As one might expect, the bulk of the narrative covers his time in the Marines, although there are a few particularly poignant moments that took place before and after his service.    As a narrative of Marine life, \\"Jarhead\\" is fascinating.  Swofford provides the best look atf life in the Marines I have ever encountered (and that includes Sledge's superb \\"With the Old Breed\\").  From his indoctrination through his deployments in the Pacific and Desert Storm, the reader is given a string of snapshots of life as a Marine that are by turns funny, appalling, terrifying and touching, but always fascinating.    That said, \\"Jarhead\\" is much more; it is Swofford's chronicle of his journey into manhood, and how the horrors of war shaped the man he would become.  Swofford reveals himself as a realist when he states in the final pages, \\"Some wars are unavoidable and need well be fought.\\"  However, he reveals the battlefield view of war when he continues, \\"but this doesn't erase warfare's waste.\\"  Swofford is no pacifist, but he has seen what war can do to a man, what war did to himself.  Above all, I suspect that \\"Jarhead\\" was a cathartic effort for Swofford, an attempt to overcome his demons by revealing them to the light of day.  At the same time, though, he has created a cautionary tale for those who make the decision to go to war; essentially, he is revealing the true price of war so that we might better determine if the use of forceis worth the cost.    Ultimately, \\"Jarhead\\" is a fascinating look at one man's journey into manhood through war.  It is not an easy read, and is profoundly sad at some points, but it is a brilliantly written and immensely important book.  One would hope that all of the soldiers the U.S. produces are so thoughtful, so well equipped to fulfill their mission even as they are revolted by its effects.  Likewise, one would hope that our leaders would read this book, and think long and hard before they send more brave, intelligent boys to face the abominations Swofford so compellingly recounts.

US	48242885	R369WIPIJYE1JP	190288132X	92248612	Adiel	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Compelling take on Creation and the Book of Genesis	There's not much point in recounting the plot of \\"Adiel\\", as it is probably a fair assumption that anyone who picks it up will be familiar with the story of Adam and Eve, their fall from Grace, and expulsion from the Garden.  Likewise, they are most likely familiar with the story of Noah and his Ark.  It is these two moments from the earliest book of the Bible that form the centerpiece of \\"Adiel\\".  DuNour brilliantly sets at odds the creation, and the loss of grace, and destruction and the redemption of mankind.    DuNour's muse is the angel Adiel, who has been called upon by God to record the works of men until such time as they can record history for themselves.  As a result, Adiel bears witness to the first ten generations of mankind: from the temptation of Eve to Noah's offer of thanksgiving.  As I alluded to earlier, DuNour weaves these two elements, the dawn of humanity and its near destruction, alternately into the story to great effect.  By offsetting the beginning and the end, he makes a powerful statement about a God who is learning to accept the path His Creation takes.  In lesser hands, this might come across as blasphemy, but DuNour paints a portrait of a God who is wise enough to know when to change course, and when to stand quietly by.    Moreover, the eponymous Adiel is a brilliantly conceived literary device.  By turning over the narration to a being whose whole will is bent utterly to God's will, but whose mind is his own, DuNour is able to offer insightful commentary on a variety of subjects.  Why does God allow man free will, when He knows wrong choices will frequently be made?  Why does He suffer evil in His creation?  Is He pleased with what He has created?  I suspect that each reader will draw different conclusions from these questions, as DuNour never attempts to answer them definitively.  That said, it is the very asking of such powerful questions that sets this book apart.    Ultimately, DuNour suggests that it is mankind's ability to overcome its mistakes that is most pleasing to God.  Moreover, this seems to be because it echoes God's own displeasure with the path his most beloved creation initially followed, and how He eventually grew out of that displeasure (perhaps sadness would be more appropriate) to love what man had become.  I am by no means a biblical scholar, and while I do believe in God, I've never taken the Book of Genesis literally, but there is something immensely comforting in DuNour's take on these ancient stories.  That's because, above all, he writes of God who wants only the best for us, and while He will allow us to suffer the consequences of our actions, it is His fervent wish that we overcome them.

US	48242885	R331VFOQII2YQO	0312890729	318023725	King Rat	Books	5	14	17	N	N	Raw, fascinating, powerful	In \\"King Rat\\" China Mieville has created a Pied Piper tale for the 21st century.  Using the duality of the ultra-chic yet hyper-primitive culture of the London club scene as his backdrop, and writing with machine-gun pacing, Mieville has created an alternate world that is by turns amusing and terrifying.  Unlike his other two novels (which are brilliant in their own right) \\"King Rat\\" is raw, there's really no other way to say it, Mieville's words drip and fester like the sewers that are his settings, and his characters resonate with appropriately primal emotion.    It would be extraordinarily difficult to do any more than sketch out the storyline without blowing the plot, but, as I alluded to above, it can safely be said that this is an entirely new and unique take on the Pied Piper.  Mieville has transformed the Piper from a jilted, mean-spirited employee, into a force of overawing malevolence and tremendous power.  At the same time, as one might deduce from the title, we follow the rats into the sewers and watch as they, and their king, plot revenge for a thousand year old injustice.    As always, Mieville's worldview is always just skewed enough to keep the reader off balance.  He takes the reader inside the Piper's song, and reveals that it is a cry out to our most base desires: lust, gluttony and greed.  Unlike a devil, which speaks with a deceitful tongue, he pulls back the veil that separates humans from animals, and that instills animals with self-preservation.  He promises all that we ever wanted, but would never admit even to ourselves.      Likewise, Mieville's characters are excellent as usual.  In particular, Saul, the half-man, half-rat who forms the centerpiece of the story is supremely well conceived and written.  His hesitance to turn his back on the human world even as he is lured by the rat world is fascinating, and both real and surreal at the same time.  In addition, the supporting cast of characters is also excellent.  Saul's human friends exude a pathos, a certain patheticism...weakness that stands in stark contrast to the animal in Saul.  Finally, there are several characters that skirt the fantastic while still being utterly grounded.  I don't want to ruin any surprises, but it is fair to say that each is superbly realized and effectively captures the essence that Mieville had in mind.    I read both of Mieville's other novels (`Perdido Street Station' and `The Scar') when they came out, and I enjoyed them both thoroughly.  Mieville's command of the language is second to none, and he absolutely revels in the descriptive power of the written word.  His characters are always morally ambiguous, and hence completely human.  That said, I never completely appreciated these novels until I explored their roots in \\"King Rat\\"; where it is raw and jarring, they are contemplative and polished.  However, they all share Mieville's boundless imagination and thoughtful writing.  \\"King Rat\\" is the first stepping-stone in what I expect to be a brilliant career, and as such, it is a superb work in its own right, and even more so, within the context of a greater body of work.

US	48242885	R19JFO4OV3XLTC	0805056866	410651536	Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life	Books	4	36	36	N	Y	Fascinating look at a surpisingly complex man	Through the lens of history, Dwight David Eisenhower, General of the Army, Supreme Allied Commander, President, is often seen as the affable embodiment of all that it is to be American.  Of course, the truth is actually much more interesting.  In Carlo D'Este's superb biography we are introduced to an Eisenhower who is full of contradictions and failings, but one who ultimately takes on a greater, and certainly more real, stature as a result of them.    As with his likewise excellent biography of Patton, D'Este sets the stage for Eisenhower's life by exploring the origins and beliefs of his forebears.  As a result, the reader is introduced to perhaps the greatest irony of Eisenhower's life: his parents were staunch pacifists, and while proud of their son's accomplishments, were never particularly comfortable with his chosen career path.  It is also worth noting that Eisenhower's life was utterly different from George Patton's, whose career became intertwined with his own.  Unlike Patton's privileged upbringing, Eisenhower was dirt poor for pretty much his entire life, and yet the two men were close friends for decades before the pressures of war drove them irretrievably apart.    What is perhaps most interesting about Eisenhower, is that America's most well known soldier never actually directly commanded men in combat.  His proficiency as a trainer kept him out of the trenches of WWI, and his skill as a staff officer meant that thereafter, he was always the brain behind the throne for a string of officers including such luminaries as MacArthur and Marshall.  Yet, it was this perceived deficit in his resume that actually proved to be his greatest strength.    Above all, Eisenhower was a master administrator; he could take a long view of the situation, and insomuch as he was able, build a consensus out of the egos of his generals.  It is perhaps the greatest strength of D'Este's research that he can paint a portrait of Eisenhower beset on all sides by prima donnas like Montgomery, Bradley and Patton, who is still able to maintain control over the long term progress of the war.  D'Este is particularly scathing of Bradley, who is clearly the most overrated general of World War II, but even with Montgomery and Patton, who were undoubtedly Eisenhower's superiors in matters of operational art, he correctly recognizes that they lacked the fundamental character traits that made Eisenhower so successful as Supreme Commander.  Traits like patience, affability, and the ability to place the good of the Allies above his own feelings meant that he could guide a supremely fractious coalition to victory.    That's not to say that D'Este is an unabashed admirer of Eisenhower.  He correctly recognizes that, particularly early in the war, Eisenhower was far too tentative in his command.  Moreover, he had a tendency to place personal loyalty above competency, and tolerated far too many laggards on his staff for political reasons.  Moreover, as an infantryman, Eisenhower never completely grasped the need for maneuver and speed in his operations, a failing that lay at the root of his problems with Patton.  That said, Eisenhower is often unduly criticized for not capturing Berlin.  Military considerations and possibilities aside, any captured territory behind that designated in the Yalta agreements would have been turned over to the Soviets at the conclusion of hostilities anyway.    Finally, a few complaints about what is overall an excellent work.  First, D'Este all too frequently digresses into long descriptions of the operational situation and then fails to link it back to Eisenhower.  It is perhaps inevitable in that Eisenhower was in a position where he was frequently just an overseer.  Still, I would argue that there are plenty of fine operational histories of WWII, and that the narrative could have been greatly improved by more effectively tying Eisenhower to the action on the ground.  Secondly, while I applaud the use of primary sources, D'Este's use of the them is oddly stilted.  For example, he will insert the text of a letter from Mamie Eisenhower to Ike, but then fail to link it to the overall flow of the narrative.  Such non sequitors can be very disruptive, and more than once I had to flip back a page to pick up the point D'Este was trying to convey.  Lastly, I was rather disappointed that D'Este didn't include Eisenhower's illustrious post-war career.  While 1945 is certainly a logical stopping point, and D'Este can hardly be blamed for not tackling the monumental task of researching the post-war years, I finished this work feeling that I didn't have a complete picture of either Eisenhower the soldier, or the man.    Those complaints aside, I would like to reiterate that this is a superb biography.  As was the case with \\"Patton: A Genius\\" for war, D'Este reveals his admiration when appropriate but is never unbalanced as a result.  He gives a fair evaluation of Eisenhower's triumphs, and likewise considers his tragedies, and his miscues.  Throughout, he offers a fascinating, thoroughly real portrait of a remarkable man.  Perhaps the best compliment I can pay to this book is to state that it is my sincere hope that D'Este will follow it up with a second volume covering 1945 to the end of Eisenhower's life.

Set in a near future where taxes have been abolished, the government privatized and the NRA is outsourcing its private army to the world's largest corporations, \\"Jennifer Government\\" is by turns funny and terrifying.    The novel kicks off in a fashion that would be funny if it wasn't so deadly serious.  As Nike assassinates customers in order to develop street credibility, the Government attempts to halt the carnage.  The result is a trade war that extends beyond the use of advertising and into the use of heavy artillery.  Along the way, the reader is introduced to several remarkable characters, including the eponymous Jennifer Government, who, while stylized, are remarkably effective.    At the same time, the writing and pacing are both excellent; a big problem with satire is that it all too often bogs down under the weight of its own righteous outrage.  Fortunately, nothing could be further from the case with \\"Jennifer Government\\", the story hums along at break-neck pace, and the dialogue is snappy, without being abrupt.    As with any satire, the reader would be well advised to take this novel with a grain of salt.  I think Max Barry would be the first to admit that it is unlikely that Burger King and McDonalds are going to engage in a shooting war any time soon.  That said, he does make a powerful statement about the deadening effects modern corporate culture can have on the human psyche, not to mention mankind, and the planet, as a whole.    \\"Jennifer Government\\" is a well written, entertaining satire; the author injects his dystopian future with just enough absurdity to keep the book from bogging down, but not so much that it becomes completely nonsensical.  Ultimately \\"Jennifer Government\\" is both an engaging read, and a reminder that the important things in life don't come from a store.    Jake Mohlman	2003-02-26

By turns photo album, travelogue and field guide, this book transcends any one of these classifications and becomes something truly \\"remarkable\\" as a result.<br />First off, the photography is absolutely spectacular, and all the more impressive because the author took the pictures himself.  Anyone who has wiled away the hours beneath the branches of a particularly noble arboreal friend, can't help but be enchanted by these shots.  Reproduced with beautiful clarity and color, Pakenham succeeds in capturing the essence of each of his subjects.<br />Secondly, Pakenham's descriptions of how he came across these trees are engaging in their own right.  The \\"World\\" in the title isn't just for show; he literally travels to the ends of the earth to capture his remarkable subjects.  His musings about what trees reflect of the surrounding culture and geography are fascinating and engaging.  While anyone who buys this book is clearly doing so for the photography, that doesn't mean that the writing is at all sub-par.<br />Finally, while this isn't a botanical study by any means, Pakenham does discuss some interesting aspects of tree-ring dating, conservation, and evolution.  While no particular topic is considered in any great detail, he offers plenty of jumping off points for anyone interested in pursuing the subject matter in more detail.<br />\\"Remarkable Trees of the World\\" is a must have for any nature lover.  Pakenham does a superb job of surveying a broad variety of trees, and there were several I'd never even heard of.  Moreover, he offers great suggestions about which of these trees will survive where; I'm already looking forward to a more varied planting than I had planned on in my backyard this spring!<br />Enjoy!	2003-01-09
US	48242885	R3ONQL6040ASX4	0385506686	290935571	Utopia: A Thriller	Books	5	81	84	N	N	Excellent solo debut	After seven great novels (and one in the can) with Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child decided to stretch his legs as a solo writer with \\"Utopia\\".  As a long time fan of the two, I couldn't have been more impressed with the result.  Like his collaborative efforts, \\"Utopia\\" offers a genuinely original story wrapped up in all kinds of neat technology.  What makes \\"Utopia\\" shine, though, is the excellent back-story and the superb characters.<br />\\"Utopia\\" is set in an amusement park of the same name, but this isn't just any amusement park.  It is an enormous glass dome in the middle of the Nevada desert.  Inside, one can find astonishingly realistic recreations of Victorian England, a turn of the Century American seaside boardwalk, Camelot and a futuristic spaceport (and, Atlantis: Coming Soon!).  Of course each area includes the most fantastic rides one can imagine, as well as restaurants, live shows, reasonably priced forty dollar t-shirts and...casinos.  Moreover, Utopia is the owner of hundreds of patents relating to holograms , robotics and computing.<br />As one might imagine, all of this money and technology makes for a tempting target, and right on cue, John Doe appears to insert chaos into this little piece of paradise.  At the same time, Andrew Warne, the creator of the park's robots, arrives to troubleshoot some strange problems that have been occurring (with daughter in tow).  As mayhem breaks loose in the park, Warne struggles to decipher Doe's plan, and stop him before it's too late.<br />The story is unlike anything I have ever encountered before; a rare unique effort in a world of rehashed ideas.  But it was the characters that impressed me the most.  In addition to capturing their current concerns and fears beautifully, Child is constantly dropping little hints about their pasts: where they came from, what they do, who they love, etc.  At the same time, he never let's himself get distracted; he doesn't diverge from the story, but rather inserts little asides to flesh out the characters without delving into reams of details.  He is particularly successful with John Doe in this regard, and the result is a compelling, but mysterious character.<br />\\"Utopia\\" is a fast paced thriller with a lot of heart.  Wrapped in a high-tech wonderland, there are characters with believable, rich lives.  The pacing, structure and use of language are all likewise excellent.  I have to admit, having been a long time fan of Child's joint work, I was concerned about his decision to go solo.  I needn't have been, as \\"Utopia\\" is an excellent novel by any measure.  Now I just have to wait eagerly for Preston's solo effort later this year!	2003-01-02
US	48242885	RN3ZDR9P5EQMZ	0375508562	520161075	The Demon in the Freezer: A True Story	Books	5	42	44	N	N	Fascinating & Terrifying	Richard Preston's first work of non-fiction, \\"The Hot Zone\\" was a gruesome look at emerging viruses in general, and the Ebola virus in particular.  However, no matter how grotesque it got, the reader could detach themselves from the book because Ebola is basically unheard of in the developed world, and isn't particularly effective at spreading (it kills its victims to quickly).  His latest, \\"The Demon in the Freezer\\" is another story altogether.<br />In it, he discusses the appalling specter of smallpox in general, and weaponized smallpox in particular.  By using the anthrax attacks of 2001 as a jumping off point, he delves into a fascinating exploration of a disease that most people consider eradicated.  Unfortunately, Preston reveals that this is far from the case.  While it is true that smallpox hasn't occurred naturally in 25 years, it is accepted (if not altogether proven) that the Russians have significant stockpiles of particularly virulent smallpox.  Moreover, it seems probable that some of this material has found its way into the hands of other actors (Iran, Iraq, North Korea).  Finally, give the abundance of smallpox samples available just three decades ago, it seems likely that parallel programs could have been pursued in any number of countries.<br />In clear (if you've studied any biology at all, you should be fine with the terms in this book, and there is a glossary), vibrant language, Preston explores the personalities and institutions involved in trying to understand what smallpox today would mean.  With a significant portion of the population having never been vaccinated, and the efficacy of 30-year-old vaccinations in serious doubt, it is a certainty that the release of even \\"natural\\" smallpox would be an absolutely devastating event.  But what is even scarier is the possibility for engineered viruses that could burn through a fresh round of vaccinations and that would be almost impossible to counter.<br />As compelling as the subject matter is, and as breathless as Preston's writing is, it bears mentioning that he does an excellent job of staying above the scientific debate.  His narrative is nothing if not evenhanded, and he goes to great lengths to report varying points of view in an engaging, but dispassionate tone.  The closest he comes to editorializing is when he takes a jab (that is to my mind well deserved) at the Clinton administration for handling the Russians with kid gloves when the U.S. knew for a fact, from a variety of sources that, they had huge stockpiles of smallpox.  The end result of this rather typical bungling was the loss of security, the loss of accountability, and the loss of awareness as to the material's locale.<br />In light of the Bush Administration's recent decision to begin immunizing health care workers, and to begin stockpiling enough vaccine for every American, this book takes on a whole new importance.  Anyone who doesn't understand the decision, or what the consequences of bio-warfare are, would do well the read this book.  Moreover, anyone who doubts the grave threat to all mankind posed by smallpox will find this book a disturbing eye-opener.  It is eminently readable and is loaded with fascinating, downright terrifying, information.	2002-12-28

Written in the same style as Sobel's \\"For Want of a Nail\\", the action is presented in the form of a history text, rather than a novel in the traditional sense.  So instead of characters, the reader gets footnotes and \\"historical\\" asides.  It is a fascinating way to write a work of fiction, and Kantor did an admirable job of it in this instance.<br />He takes two near simultaneous events as his turning points: Grant's death in a horse accident prior to his capture of Vicksburg, and the rout of the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg.  Going forward from that point, he posits Lincoln's flight from Washington, the establishment of the Republic of Texas, and a host of other events, large and small, that lend far more realism to his allohistorical world than one might expect out of a story of less than a hundred pages.<br />As it happens, I think that a Civil War ending in Confederate victory would have left far more acrimony than Kantor predicts.  However, it is the beauty of good alternate history that one need not agree with the author's interpretations to enjoy it.  So long as the author's conclusions are well researched, logical and well argued (and that is absolutely the case in this instance) one can't take issue with them.  Moreover, half the fun is stacking up your conclusions of what might have happened against the author's, and seeing how you rate.<br />Don't let its size fool you; \\"If the South Had Won the Civil War\\" is an intelligent, engaging alternate history.  Kantor makes some genuinely fascinating leaps, and his logic and conclusions are ironclad.  <br />Enjoy!	2002-12-28

S. Merwin's translation of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" is not quite at the level of Seamus Heaney's \\"Beowulf\\".  Heaney created an absolute masterpiece; the type of translation that comes along only once every few generations, and which completely redefines the view of the subject matter.  The difference between the two translations lies in Heaney's ability to capture the meter and rhyme of \\"Beowulf\\" without being slavish to the original structure.  Merwin has followed a similar approach in his translation, and while the language is beautiful, I didn't sense the same ancient vibrancy I got from Heaney's work.<br />That said, this book is more than worthy of the five-star rating that I gave it.  Merwin's use of language is absolutely superb, and the resulting translation is a remarkable tapestry of images.  In particular, he deftly captures the underlying tension and eroticism that forms such a key element of the story.  Gawain's struggle to remain true to his code is rendered perfectly, and sets a mood of self-doubt that perfectly offsets his outward frivolity.<br />Since I have already mentioned \\"Beowulf\\" I might add for those unfamiliar with \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" that it is much more subtle than the former.  While \\"Beowulf\\" is undeniably open to interpretation (indeed there is a wealth of fascinating scholarship surrounding it), its basic elements are much more straightforward.  At its heart, as Tolkien espoused so brilliantly, \\"Beowulf\\" is a story about monsters, and what they mean in our world.  On the other hand, \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" is more interested in exploring the ideals of chivalry and courtly love.  While there is a fair bit of gore, it strikes me as being more of the hook to keep the reader engaged, rather than the core element of the story.  Finally, in it's conclusion, \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\" is far more vague than Beowulf.<br />Merwin has produced as a translation of the highest quality.  While perhaps less \\"poetic\\" than some of its predecessors, it is written in a language that captures the full beauty and vibrancy of this remarkable poem.  While a mere 84 pages in length (not including the opposing pages in Old English) this is a tale rich in metaphor that is a delight to read, and that will leave you pondering its meaning.Beowulf.<br />Merwin has produced as a translation of the highest quality.

This time, Michael Crichton has chosen to explore the potential and hazards of nanotechnology; the fashioning of robots at the molecular level.  The power of these machines is that they are small enough to go anywhere, and their capabilities are limited only by human creativity.  However, since they are so small, they need to be able to apply adaptive learning in order to accomplish their assigned tasks, and that's where the trouble starts.<br />The novel begins with Jack Forman, stay at home dad, and long time, but currently unemployed software engineer, shopping for placemats.  This touch of normalcy sets up an environment where Crichton can rapidly ratchet up the tension, as an all-American home life turns distinctly scary.  Moreover, Crichton has written the book in the first person, so the reader really has the opportunity to roam around Jack's head.  As a result, Jack may be the best character Crichton has written to date.  His emotions leap off the page, and his thought processes allow Crichton to seamlessly integrate necessary expository elements into the flow of the novel.<br />Of course, Jack doesn't remain the house-husband for long.  It turns out that there are problems at Xymos Corporation, where his wife is a vice-president.  It seems that they've lost control of some of the nano-particle swarms that they were working on, and they need Jack to help bring them back into the fold.  As it turns out, Jack wrote an early version of the software (which is based upon predator-prey relationships) that is being used as the brains behind the swarm.  As an added level of intrigue, Jack suspects that his wife is having an affair with one of the people at Xymos' fabrication plant.<br />I don't want to say much more for fear of ruining the plot, but as one would expect, the situation quickly spirals out of control in typical Crichton-esque fashion.  Specifically, I think I can say without giving anything away, that he does a superb job of imbuing what are essential machines with an incredible sense of malice.  Anyone who thinks that tiny machines acting in groups aren't scary will quickly have their minds changed by this novel.<br />As with all of Crichton's best work \\"Prey\\" leaves you not only entertained, but feeling like you learned something as well.  At the same time, unlike \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Timeline\\" which employed technically possible, but functionally questionable technology, nanotechnology is on its way, and is already here to a degree.  Already there are microchip sized laboratories that can perform dozens of experiments on a single drop of blood, and there are exotic materials custom built for specific functions from the molecular level.  It is entirely likely, even probable, that within ten or twenty years, we will see some crude version of the technology that plays the central role in the novel.  As a result, Crichton writes with a sense of urgency that makes this a thriller you don't want to put down.  This is definitely one of his best novels to date: an incredibly exciting story filled with cutting edge, but easily understood, technology.  A must read!<br />Enjoy!	2002-11-25

It's hard to say more about this book than I have about the prior two, but to summarize:  if you are a Simpsons fan, you need \\"The Simpsons Beyond Forever\\", and its predecessors, \\"The Simpsons Forever\\" and \\"The Simpsons Forever Cont'd\\".  Like the other two, the current edition follows the same format: each episode is reviewed in detail, and there are pages for such miscellaneous items as when Homer says \\"D'oh!\\", songs, etc.  For each episode, the reader is treated to a plot summary, stills from the episode, what the couch and chalkboard gags are, and \\"Stuff you might have missed\\".  The last item is particularly enjoyable, because there is always so much going on in any given episode, it is almost impossible to keep up with it all.  In particular, there are many pop culture and movie tributes that are clarified.<br />I'll always love The Simpsons, but these books take watching the show to a whole new level, whether it's figuring out that voice cameo that's driving you nuts, or catching a joke that came and went too fast.  Moreover, these books are just fun to look at, they are brightly colored, creatively arranged, and printed with the highest quality.  This is a must have for any Simpsons fan!	2002-11-01

In part, it is a success; Tally has identified many notable potential turning points, from areas of the American experience.  Rather than focusing solely on military or political what-ifs, he considers sports, entertainment and business as well.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that Tally has identified some of the most genuinely fascinating potential alternate histories I have ever encountered in the genre.  In particular, his discussions of the battle for Fort Sackville, Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", and IBM's relationship with Microsoft, are both original and no less important for being somewhat obscure.<br />Unfortunately, this is where Tally stumbles.  While his training as a historian allowed him to select and intelligently discuss a variety of events, his alternate histories are sorely lacking in creativity and consequence.  More often than not, Tally writes a history that is almost completely convergent with actual history, which undermines the significance of his selection.  Moreover, for someone who has a firm foundation in history, he posits some extremely unlikely events.  For example, in his alternate history where Bastogne fell to the Germans, he has them pressing the attack all the way to Antwerp on the supply of 4 million gallons of gas captured in Spa.  Even if the Americans had been utterly routed, it would have been a simple and certain procedure to destroy those stocks, which is precisely why the German offensive was doomed from the get go.<br />Finally, there are frequent, blatant typos that distract from both the flow and the credibility of the book.  One in particular that jumped off the page was that the U2 looked down on the Soviet Union from \\"seventy thousand miles up\\"!  If that was the case, it is even more impressive that the Soviets were able to shoot it down, asit was one-third of the way to the moon.<br />In the end, Tally has done an admirable job of illuminating some forgotten, or unappreciated, episodes in American history, and for that reason alone, \\"Almost America\\" makes for interesting reading.  Unfortunately, his alternate histories are more often than not, clunky and uninteresting.  If he were to partner with a novelist, I think there is some great potential to be found in this book, but as things stand now, it is only a half realized project.	2002-10-31

While his most prolific period is now four decades past, Bradbury's descriptions of the hopes and fears of childhood still strike a powerful chord; in particular, he is able to capture the fears of childhood from an adult's perspective, without in any way minimizing them.<br />In \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" the reader is treated the pinnacle of Bradbury's writings on childhood.  In it, he explores the most fundamental desire, and conversely, the most fundamental fear of childhood: growing older.  Who among us wouldn't have leapt at the opportunity to be \\"grown up\\" at the snap of our fingers, but what about the consequences?  Here, Bradbury uses the metaphor of a carnival that preys upon the fears of growing older, quite literally, in order to sustain itself.<br />The two main characters, Will in Jim, are fourteen, and in that awkward time that is not quite adulthood but not quite childhood either.  They are torn between the desire to plunge into adult life, even as they cling to the safety of childhood.  In this regard they are no different from any other child, the difference is that the carnival, and it's mysterious merry-go-round make it possible for them to do something about this situation.  Juxtaposing their dilemma is Will's father, who married and had Will relatively late and life, and feels his age all the more as a result of his young son.<br />\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a clever, spooky story, perfect for Halloween time.  Bradbury is a master of descriptive writing, and no one sets a mood better than he does.  More than that, tough, this is a novel about coming of age, about the value of youth, but also about appreciating where you are and what you have achieved.  It is heartfelt and sincere in an age where far too many novels use cynicism as a mask for a lack of ideas.  For that reason alone, this is a novel that is well worth reading.<br />Enjoy!	2002-10-30

However, it is all of these factors that make it such a wonderful portrait of men in combat.  Ambrose wasn't setting out to write a history of the European Theater of Operations, he wasn't even trying to write a history of the 101st Airborne.  Rather, he was trying to capture something of the uncommon courage show by these otherwise common men in this face of astonishing trials.<br />Ambrose picks up the story of Easy Company as they work their way through training, and follows it all the way through to the end of the war.  In between, through an enormous volume of first hand interviews, he paints a harrowing picture of the men of Easy as they slog through Europe.  It's not always pretty; Ambrose doesn't pull any punches, particularly when it comes to inept leadership (and he names names), and he doesn't take any pains to hide the drinking and gambling.  The result, though, is an intimate view of men who have been thrust into extraordinary circumstances, and are just struggling to get by.<br />Because of the book's limited scope, Ambrose was able to capture the chaos of combat quite effectively.  The big picture is rarely elaborated upon, and the reader is presented with Easy Company, time and again, hanging on to survive, and then taking the fight to the enemy.  One can't help but feel that this approach more than adequately captures the sense of isolation that men in infantry combat must feel.<br />If you are looking for a comprehensive history of airborne operations in World War II this is not the book for you.  But if you are seeking a deeper understanding of why these men were able to face extraordinary odds and win, of what made them brothers in the truest sense of the word, then you would do well to pick up this book.  By turns funny and sad, unbearably tense and lighthearted, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a remarkable look at what combat can do to men, and how they can make something good out of something awful.	2002-10-26

He created a fascinating portrait of the chance meetings that drive us on to our destinies; a task that in less gifted hands would be burdensome, but that was elegant and light in Mitchell's.  Unfortunately, \\"Number9Dream\\" doesn't quite live up to the high benchmark he set with his first novel.<br />The book's primary problem is that Mitchell was far too clever for his own good.  As the reader follows the protagonist, Eiji Miyake, on his search for this father, and his place in the world, they are buffeted by numerous asides, dreams, stories, fantasies, etc.  Any one of these is extremely well written, but taken as a whole they make for a disjointed reading experience.  Their purpose is to explore the interactions Mitchell considered so deftly in \\"Ghostwritten\\" but as they pertain to just one individual.  However, the end result is a chaotic mishmash that is frequently entertaining, and always well written, but rarely satisfying.<br />That said, I wouldn't necessarily recommend against reading \\"Number9Dream\\", for one thing a sub par effort for David Mitchell is better than 90% of what's on the market today.  Moreover, he makes some really interesting points about the nature of society and his ending (which I am sure many found abrupt) is a fascinating point about the fleeting nature of contentment, ambition and desire.<br />In the end, David Mitchell should be complimented for writing a novel that challenges the definitions of plotting and characterization.  While the attempt falls somewhat short, it is still a noteworthy sophomore effort.  If you don't mind a novel that makes you work a little, \\"Number9Dream\\" is an interesting effort from a young writer who is just hitting his stride.	2002-10-17

While this book doesn't really add to the monologue, it is a superb visual representation of it.  The humor is typically dry, but it is also so earnest, and common, that one can't help but laugh.  Who among us hasn't been brutalized by the smothering, plastic Halloween mask with the stupid elastic that keeps breaking?  And the illustrations are just a riot; they are colorful, clever and perfectly illustrate the writing.<br />I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't a book for children.  Not because there is anything wrong with the language or themes, but because it too accurately portrays a child's point of view.  A kid would read this and think, \\"Yeah, so?\\" because Seinfeld so perfectly represents their experience that they wouldn't appreciate the irony.  As an adult, however, I have been revisiting my own Halloween conquests and catastrophes all day thanks to this wonderful book.<br />Enjoy!	2002-10-15
US	48242885	R5TCGICGWRFD1	0440236169	504517515	Birdman	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	A genuinely creepy novel	\\"Birdman\\" by Mo Hayder is one of the rare suspense novels published today that is willing to be something more than completely formulaic.  While not perfect, Hayder has created a novel that is suspenseful, disturbing, original and entertaining.  Her characters are complex and interesting, and she displays a gift for setting the mood.<br />The action takes place in London during the summer of 1999; five bodies have been discovered at a construction site, each one containing a horrifying surprise.  The reader follows Detective Inspector Caffery as he struggles to catch up with the killer, even as more bodies appear.  As he draws closer, a surprising plot twist with 100 pages to go only adds to the suspense.<br />It is Caffery's character that really makes this novel. He is haunted by the disappearance of his brother when they were both children, and, as a result, he struggles with relationships and has a dark edge to his personality.  As he races against the clock to find the killer, he struggles with his own inner demons, and comes across as much less squeaky clean than your typical suspense hero.<br />Then there are the crimes themselves; in a genre that has seen just about everything, Hayder managed to stake out a truly original (and gruesome) M.O.  Along those lines, if you have a weak stomach, you'll probably want to skip this novel.  The violence isn't gratuitous, but it is graphic.<br />Ultimately, this is an entertaining read, with above average writing and some genuine thrills.  The fact that it takes place in England also adds a twist for American readers, as firearms are nowhere to be found.  Moreover, the descriptions of police procedure are detailed enough to be interesting without being overbearing.  If you're looking for a fun novel for the weekend, you would do well to pick up \\"Birdman\\".<br />Enjoy!	2002-10-04

In \\"The Dream of Scipio\\" he has gone one step further and written a novel that spreads perspective over 1500 years, and whose primary plot point is an idea. Obviously, this is not the conventional way to write a novel, and in the hands of someone less skilled it would be a disaster. However, Pears able hands have produced a work bursting at the seams with ideas.<br />It would be difficult to offer a plot summary in the traditional sense, but I am going to attempt to summarize the themes and settings of the book. I would like to apologize in advance if I seem vague, but it would be difficult to discuss the plot in any detail without ruining the book. As I alluded to earlier, just as \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" considered a central plot point from four perspectives, so to does \\"The Dream of Scipio\\" from three. The difference is that the first examined something vary tactile (a murder) from four contemporary viewpoints, but in this instance the characters are considering a manuscript (or more accurately, a philosophy) and are separated by 1500 years. What links these otherwise temporally diverse men are the times and place in which they live and the women they love. Each is living during the shattering of civilization: Manlius during the winter of the Roman Empire, Olivier during the plague, and Julien during World War II. Moreover, they all live in France, in Provence, and almost the entirety of the novel takes place in the vicinity of Avignon. As such, there are historical echoes that resonate down through the ages.<br />Perhaps the most startling of these echoes are the women they love. Each is an outcast in her own way, and all of them have their fates wrapped up with those of the Jews, who were horribly persecuted in each time period. Pears hints at reincarnation for these three couples, but that might be too obvious a turn of phrase. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they are linked by their knowledge of those who came before, and are striving to overcome the failures of the past and preserve civilization for another day. It would seem that Pears sees civilization as a spiral ascending upwards. At certain points on the spiral we will revisit the errors of the past, and even as mankind's advancement has provided the tools for increasing horror exponentially, it has also given us the lessons to try to prevent it. We won't always succeed, and frequently the solution will actually set civilization back more than the problem, but the attempt can be (although isn't always) valuable in and off itself.<br />That's \\"A Dream of Scipio\\" in a nutshell. It is obviously not a \\"conventional\\" novel, and if your looking for something light and easy, this is one you'll want to skip. However, if you are looking for something that will really make you think, that will in fact force you to think just to keep up with the plot, then this is a novel for you.Pears hints at reincarnation for these three couples, but that might be too obvious a turn of phrase.

US	48242885	R10GBO803ANBT0	0451169530	825352881	The Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)	Books	5	1012	1047	N	N	A brilliant novel!	Before I get to the meat of my review, I feel I should provide a little bit of perspective.  First, I am not a die-hard Stephen King fan.  In fact, aside from \\"The Stand\\", I have only read collections of his short stories, so I can assure you my review isn't the rabid defense of an overly loyal admirer.  Second, I am not a fan of horror and I wouldn't classify \\"The Stand\\" as such.  Finally, I am a big fan of the \\"apocalyptic fiction\\" genre, and I believe I have a pretty good basis for my evaluation of this novel.<br />That said, \\"The Stand\\" is an incredible novel; perhaps one of the best I have ever read, by any author or in any genre.  The story is predicated on the accidental release of a \\"super-flu\\" that wipes out 99% of the humans on the planet.  The survivors find themselves drawn into a battle between good and evil that will determine the future of the entire planet.<br />As one might expect, a novel with such an ambitious plot and of such prodigious length touches upon numerous themes.  In order to simplify my review, I am going to break down the novel's strengths into the following categories, and then consider them one at a time: world-building, plot, characters and themes.  <br />First is world-building.  In most apocalyptic fiction, one (if not both) of two things will be true: 1. The characters stay in one place or 2. The action picks up after the disaster.  An example of the first is \\"Earth Abides\\" and of the latter \\"On the Beach\\".  There's nothing wrong with either plot device, but in \\"The Stand\\" King injects a remarkable level of detail into his novel by covering the super-flu from start to finish.  The novel starts at the very beginning of the outbreak, and many key plot lines are developed before the epidemic ever rears its head.  King charts the breakdown and eventual destruction of civilization, and then offers a short, but remarkable, picture of the survivors in the immediate days after the flu has run its course.  He makes the subtle observationthat many survivors would die in a second wave of suicides, accidents and depression that would weed out many of those unequipped for an empty world.  Finally, as the story progresses, King makes remarkable (but not overbearing) predictions about how nature would reshape the U.S. in the absence of man.<br />Second to consider is the plot.  As I alluded to earlier, King has used the emptied United States as a battleground between good and evil.  Soon after the flu has run its course, the survivors begin having dreams about an old woman (Mother Abigail) who seems to be marshalling the forces of good, and a malign presence (Randall Flagg) who is gathering those who would serve him and his ends.  Insofar as the reader knows, the choice is clear-cut, irrevocable and mandatory.  It is very much a \\"are you with us or against us\\" type of situation.  That said, much of the book is devoted to the characters traveling across country to Boulder or Las Vegas (guess which side is where), no mean feat in a world without mass transit, hotels, etc.  In fact, King's writing is so effective, the novel would be fascinating if the characters did nothing but travel around and attempt to reestablish society.  The second, metaphysical, layer just makes it all the more interesting.<br />Thirdly, we have the characters to consider; I'll won't name names or speak in specifics to avoid ruining the plot, but there are a few general points worth mentioning.  To start, the cast of characters in \\"The Stand\\" rivals that of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and King handles it every bit as well as Tolkien.  One might expect that a novel with a story this complex would skimp on character development, but the opposite is actually true.  King took a huge idea (good vs. evil) and reduced it to a human element that the reader could digest.  His characters show an incredible range of emotion, and even their flaws serve to enhance the reader's view of them.  They struggle and fail and are rarely sure of themselves, inother words, they are human.  As such, their actions take on a level of realism that is astonishing.<br />Finally, we come to the themes of the book.  The way I see it there are three: the dualistic nature of good and evil, redemption and hope.  The first is the most obvious, King correctly points out that good cannot be appreciated or striven for in the absence of bad.  We can strive to limit the effects of evil, but it will never be overcome, as King sees greed and hate as intrinsic to the human condition in general, and civilization specifically.  The second theme, of redemption, is subtler and offsets the first.  King does not paint anyone is irretrievably lost, and along the same lines, he considers how good intentions are frequently misdirected through ignorance and fear.  King seems to believe that given the opportunity and support, anyone can salvage their lives.  Which brings us to the final theme of hope.  As the novel ends, the reader knows that evil has not been vanquished, but also that it can never triumph because within its very nature are the seeds of its destruction.  Over time, evil empires have gained power because they have torn down their enemies (see Nazi Germany), but as the saying goes, live by the sword, die by the sword.  There is always hope, because evil cannot win.<br />There are so many other points to touch on, I could write indefinitely, but what it all comes down to is this: if you're looking for a novel that will entertain you even as it makes you think, \\"The Stand\\" is for you.<br />Enjoy!	2002-09-20
US	48242885	R2FKFLU85L5NDS	0935112766	389987932	A Nation Challenged: A Visual History of 9/11 and Its Aftermath	Books	4	28	29	N	N	Unven, but nonetheless remarkable book	There's no denying that the photography in this book is spectacular, and as one would expect from a NY Times book, the writing is superb.  Unfortunately, \\"A Nation Challenged\\" doesn't completely live up to expectations.  There are two main reasons for that.  First, the coverage of 9/11 is overwhelmingly skewed towards the events at the World Trade Center.  While there is no denying that New York City has come to represent the epicenter of that horrible day, there were equally horrific tragedies taking place on a smaller scale in Washington D.C. and over Pennsylvania.  I would have expected that an institution as reputable as the New York Times would have taken a more balanced approach in their reporting.  My second complaint is that the final forty pages, or so, are devoted exclusively to portraits of the Afghan people.  In and of itself, that's fine, but given the book's title, I would have expected more American viewpoints, whether firemen, policemen, or members of the armed services.  I fail to see what is gleaned about the American condition of the last year from interviews with Afghanis.<br />Those thoughts aside, though, this is an incredible collection of photographs and writing that is well worth owning.  One thing about 9/11 is that it was a beautiful sunny day, and the photographs in this volume would be stunning if they weren't so horrific.  Interspersed with reproductions of Times' front pages and writing from those pages, are astonishing photographs (many of which I had never seen before) that capture that day and the following weeks in all their horror.  ***WARNING, some of the pictures are very graphic, if you aren't prepared for the emotional impact of revisiting 9/11, you would do well to pass on this book.  However, if you are prepared to turn your thoughts to that day when everything changed, this is the book to start with.<br />\\"A Nation Challenged\\" represents an excellent record, both visually and in writing, of 9/11.  While there are already many books about that day available, and there will undoubtedly be hundreds more, I suspect that very few will be of the same quality as this volume.  The reason for this is the weird dichotomy of a paper with global resources having the biggest event of the last fifty years take place in its backyard.  While I do have some complaints with the distribution of the coverage, there is no debating the superb quality of the reporting and photography, or the immense integrity of the Times editorial board.  This is not an easy book to look at, but it is a remarkable history of a day when, \\"history splits, and we define the world as `before' and `after.'\\"	2002-08-23
US	48242885	R3DR4V2T7I942U	0156002086	253440654	This Is the Way the World Ends	Books	4	49	50	N	Y	An odd, but interesting, post-pocalyptic novel	Sandwiched between vignettes of Nostradamus, \\"This is the Way the World Ends\\" is the tale of George Paxton, and the five other remaining humans on Earth.  Unfortunately for George, he and the others are being tried for war crimes stemming from the nuclear destruction of the planet by the \\"unadmitted\\"; basically unborn generations that have willed themselves into existence for a brief time in order to inquire why their potential will never be realized.  Compounding George's dilemma is the fact that unlike his fellow defendants, who are all wizards of nuclear strategy, George is just a simple everyman (with the ironic profession of tomb stone carver) whose only \\"guilt\\" was in not carefully reading a sales contract for a free nuclear survival suit for his daughter.<br />As one can tell from this brief synopsis of the plot, this is not your ordinary work of post-apocalyptic fiction.  Or rather, it covers the same ground, but from a completely different angle.  The Nostradamus bookends offer an air of inevitability to the narrative, and introduce a major plot device, and Morrow's description of a nuclear war's aftermath is highly engaging.  Where this novel really shines, however, is in the trial.<br />One might expect Morrow to be a staunch proponent of disarmament given the theme of his book, but that assumption is not entirely true.  Through the mechanism of the trial, he rails against both the naivet&eacute; of the doves, and the hawks' disconnect from reality.  As another reviewer so eloquently stated, he demolishes the generally accepted duality of nuclear politics, and demands the reader consider a third path of their own making.  That's where George comes in; his real guilt is not in his action, but in his inaction.<br />While much of \\"This is the Way the World Ends\\" is written in the language of 1980's Cold War rhetoric, and the threat of a massive nuclear exchange has, if not passed, certainly lessened immensely, the novel still offers great insight.  First of all, Morrow's discussion of deterrence versus disarmament is fascinating; in fact (and I say this with the benefit of a degree in the subject) they would be more than adequate points of departure for any undergraduate course in international security.  Particularly fascinating are his statements within ten pages that (paraphrased) 1. You can't have deterrence without strength and 2. Strength leads to escalation leads to instability.  Morrow doesn't offer any answers, but he does frame some fascinating questions.  Around those questions he has built a novel of intense emotion and beautiful characters; the last time a book's ending moved me so intensely was another classic of the genre, \\"On the Beach\\".  And while I wouldn't place it in quite the same league as Nevil Shute's masterwork, it is nonetheless a remarkable book that is eminently worth reading.<br />Enjoy!orrow's discussion of deterrence versus disarmament is fascinating; in fact (and I say this with the benefit of a degree in the subject) they would be more than adequate points of departure for any undergraduate course in international security.

US	48242885	R3NTC9WU4DPCJK	0195151747	846543535	Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East	Books	5	16	22	N	N	Remarkable portrait of a conflcit that still haunts us today	In \\"Six Days of War\\" Michael Oren has written perhaps the definitive history of one of the key pivot points of the twentieth century.  Drawing upon a wealth of first hand sources (including documents from the U.S., U.S.S.R., Israel, Egypt and Jordan) he writes a history that is at the same time thorough and vibrant.  Where many historical accounts stumble is the failure to accurately represent irrational and spur of the moment decision-making.  That is a complaint that is happily absent in this account, as Oren writes with the urgency of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and the comprehensiveness of a Keegan or Tuchman.<br />The subtitle (\\"June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East\\") actually does this book something of a disservice, because 169 of its 327 pages are devoted to explaining the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  From its roots in early 20th century Zionism, to the unbearably tense days of the spring of '67, Oren paints a fascinating portrait of the clash of cultures, wills and nations.  It bears mentioning here that I found Oren's narrative to be generally very even handed; there are other reviewers who have argued that he is an apologist for Israel, who ignores Arab grievances.  Nothing could be further from the truth; on the contrary, it is the frequently and vocally stated ambition of the Arab states to push Israel into the sea that mandates the view of Israel as the victim.  <br />Which brings us to one of the great tragedies of this war: the near mind-boggling stupidity of the Arab leaders.  Oren discusses in great deal these men, Hussein (to a lesser degree than the others), Nasser, Atef, Assad, etc., who were so concerned with their own political power that they were willing to sacrifice their young men in ill conceived operations that only succeeded in ensuring another generation of bitterness, regret and violence.  Their incompetence would be comical if it wasn't so sad; at one point Oren discusses how the Egyptians, who are in full retreat and have been basically obliterated, assure the Syrians that they are marching on Jerusalem.  The Syrians, not to be upstaged, respond that they are in route to Tel Aviv; this in spite of the fact that they had sat out the war to that point, and that the escalation only ensured the loss of the Golan to Israel.<br />Which brings us to the next point of tragic-comedy, the U.N.  While the game of high stakes poker between the U.S., the Soviets, the Israeli's and the Arab powers makes for fascinating reading, the reader can't help but see the missed opportunities.  In particular, U Thant, the Secretary General, comes across as a buffoon who is utterly lacking in both vision and ability.  At one point, during the peak of escalations prior to the war, he delays a trip to Egypt by three days so that his horoscope will be favorable for travel.  At the same time, many valid proposals from Latin America and other non-aligned nations fall to great power politics, Israeli maneuvering and Arab pride.<br />As for the war itself, Oren does a superb job of capturing the tension of the early days (to borrow from Churchill, it was a near run thing) and the maneuvering of the final hours.  Of particular interest was his repeated use of first hand sources from opposite sides to give a full picture of the battles.  It was both fascinating and heart wrenching to read the words of a triumphant Israeli, only to have them followed by the bitter words of a Jordanian or Egyptian or Syrian, who fought bravely and honorably only to be abandoned by his superiors.  Along the same lines, Oren captures King Hussein of Jordan like no other player in this drama.  He paints a picture of a horribly conflicted, but ultimately honorable man, who faces unbearable pressure from all sides.  This view is undoubtedly colored by the moderation Hussein underwent in his later years, but in my opinion it is still valid.<br />My only complaint regarding Oren's description of the actual fighting is that he needed significantly more maps.  While he does provide maps of the entire theater they present two key problems: 1. they show six days of fighting on one four square inch picture, which can be confusing to say the least, and 2. it is almost impossible to conceptualize the urban combat that took place in Jerusalem without some sort of street map.  My only other issues were that I felt Oren was far too easy on the Israeli's for their attack on the U.S.S. Liberty (although I found his description of the events to be accurate, and probably definitive), and that he was too forgiving of a Johnson administration that largely acted behind the scenes.  Regardless of other areas of political concern, it is my opinion that within the context of the Middle East, Johnson must be held at least partially responsible for the war, in that he didn't act more overtly to prevent it.<br />Ultimately, \\"Six Days of War\\" paints a fascinating portrait of the war that still dictates Mid-East negotiations.  Oren presents solid evidence that the Arab states, in a gross miscalculation, ratcheted pressure to the point where Israel was forced to act preemptively in order to assure its survival.  That said, he is blunt about Israel's diplomatic machinations in an effort to maximize its gains (only after they had realized they would win).  I would have liked to have seen the long term implications of the war discussed in greater detail, but it could be argued that falls outside the scope of this work.  Nevertheless, this is a thorough, fascinating, look at a war that is not properly appreciated for its historical import.  If we are lucky, Oren will write a history of the Yom Kippur War, and further round out or view.	2002-08-08
US	48242885	RAMXPUUZ6YTB4	0253212340	275227239	Riddley Walker, Expanded Edition	Books	5	97	106	N	Y	Unique, fully realized work of fiction	\\"Riddley Walker\\" is undeniably one of the most unique novels I have ever come across.  All plotting aside, the bizarre (yet understandable) pidgin English that it is written in sets it apart from almost every other work of fiction I have come across.  The only thing that comes close is the slang in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", but even that mishmash is normal when compared to Hoban's English.  That said, Hoban's creation is fairly logical, and is easily followed with a little bit of thought.<br />It would be easy to overlook the quality of the narrative of this novel because of the uniqueness of its presentation, but there is much more to \\"Riddley Walker\\" than that.  It is the tale of a humanity reduced to Dark Age misery by a nuclear war, but what makes it different from other apocalyptic fiction is the historical remoteness of the holocaust.  It happened so long ago, and was so total that its causes have descended into mythology.  At the same time, technology has become confused with religion, and while mankind yearns for better days, he's not sure what they might be.<br />Hoban paints a fascinating portrait of humans struggling to come to grips with their place in the world.  Particularly poignant is the image his characters have of dogs, which have at this point have gone almost completely feral, and yet still exhibit a faint longing for their old masters.  The humans see in the dogs an emblem of their fall from grace, and in the dogs' ferocity, a tacit reminder of something lost, although, again, they aren't sure what that might be.<br />Perhaps the most intriguing element of the novel, however, is fragments of history that have been reassembled into a moral imperative for the power elite (such as they are).  To the reader, the concepts seem ridiculous, but in them Hoban makes a powerful statement about the need to believe in something bigger than ourselves.  Just think about how we struggle to come to grips with the past today; a history which is documented with relative thoroughness and which spans fairly well delineated arcs.  Now imagine trying to process that same history after an apocalypse of unimaginable scope, and you will have some appreciation of what Hoban explores in \\"Riddley Walker\\".<br />This is a novel that can be read fairly quickly, and enjoyed simply as a rather unique work of post-apocalyptic fiction.  However, if you take your time with it, and really think through what the language and the characters' motivations, I suspect you will be surprised at the tremendous depth this work possesses.  I was astonished at how much it made me think about my own worldviews and how much context is critical to their meaning.  \\"Riddley Walker\\" is definitely a literary highlight of the genre, and a novel that is not to be missed.	2002-07-27
US	48242885	R3MQYDEQI8HRBC	158574297X	436615641	Twelve Days of Terror: A definitive Investigation of the 1916 New Jersey Shark Attacks	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Engaging, easy to read history of a little known epsiode	\\"In Twelve Days Of Terror\\" Richard Fernicola presents the reader with a comprehensive history of the New Jersey Shark Attacks of 1916.  In the process, he paints a fascinating portrait of an era that exists solely as collective nostalgia for many of us today.  The attacks are presented within the context of the era, so the reader is brought back to a time before television, when newspapers fought to outdo each other with spectacular headlines and our own shores were more of a mystery than the depths of Africa.<br />In telling the story of the attacks, Fernicola uses an informal, almost conversational style that is frequently in the first person.  While this would be anathema in most history, it is highly effective in this instance.  Given that his topic is not widely remembered, and that what is remembered has devolved into pseudo-mythology, this casual style captures the \\"novel-esque\\" feel of the story, while presenting the hard facts.  Of particular interest was how he set the stage for the attacks: war was raging in Europe, there was a polio epidemic in New York City, submarines were cruising the coast, and the Jersey Shore was a last bastion of elegance and innocence that was about to be shattered.  By presenting history in this manner, he creates a big picture view of not only the attacks themselves, but also what they did to the psyche of the nation.<br />All style and setting aside, however, Fernicola is a medical doctor and scientist who systematically presents the fruits of his substantial research and interviews with witnesses and experts.  Each attack is examined in detail: the attack patterns, the nature of the injuries (which are quite gruesome, be warned), treatments offered, etc.  Then, after providing the reader with a thorough portrait of the attacks, both individually and as a whole, he builds a case for the species which he thinks committed the attacks, and whether or not it was one or several sharks.  While he makes a compelling argument for thata white shark committed the attacks, in the finest tradition of research he both presents, and discusses in detail, competing theories.<br />I have only two small complaints about this book.  The first is perhaps inevitable given the informal writing style, but it bothered me nonetheless.  Fernicola frequently will meander off topic as he recounts interesting historical tidbits, only to abruptly return to the topic at hand.  The effect can be jarring and there were several passages that I had to reread in order to pick up the flow of the narrative again.  The second complaint is that he refers to shark attacks as \\"vicious\\" at least fifty times over the course of the work.  I find this troubling since \\"vicious\\" implies a malicious premeditation that a shark is obviously incapable of.  The complaint isn't just semantics either, given the already terrible reputation that sharks enjoy among most people.<br />Ultimately though, those are minor complaints about an otherwise fascinating book.  Fernicola has written a history that is as informative as it is easy to read.  In particular, this makes for a great summertime read; the author paints such a wonderful portrait of the shore that this currently landlocked New Englander felt as if he was right on the ocean.  You'll probably want to avoid \\"Twelve Days of Terror\\" if you have a weak stomach, but most people, whether they are interested in marine biology or not, will find this an excellent read.<br />Enjoy!	2002-07-15

Dick's stab at the apocalyptic fiction genre.  As usual, he enjoys success, and as usual he does so in his own unique way.  Whereas most authors are interested in how the survivors carry on (the day to day grind), Dick is more interested in what a society would look like where everyone has been brought low, and what the impact of genetic mutation would be in such a society.  Over the course of the novel, Dick makes some compelling points about racism, by pointing out that survival skills aren't based upon appearance, and not even on physical ability.<br />Unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" didn't successfully carry a theme throughout the novel, and that it was somewhat disjointed.  Nonetheless, it is a fascinating read, and Dick on his worst day is better than most authors on their best.  Of particular note was Dr. Bluthgeld, the protagonist of the book's title.  A nuclear physicist, he has become so perverted by the nuclear power he once wielded that he has mistaken god-like powers with actually being a god.  Needless to say, he descends into madness and as a result his neighbors learn a lesson about real power, and the packages it comes in.<br />Also interesting was Dick's description of a post-nuclear holocaust world.  He populates it with a host of genetic freaks, both animal and human.  All are profoundly changed, and yet familiar enough to be deeply disturbing.  At the same time he throws in little details that lend his creation great depth: horse drawn cars, a cigarette factory, a stranded astronaut acting as the world's last remaining D.J.  None offers the big picture view of an \\"Earth Abides\\" or \\"Alas Babylon\\" but they are small details that hint at big things, and engage the imagination in a unique way.<br />Ultimately, \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" hints at some intriguing ideas, but never follows all the way through on them.  Nonetheless, it is an engaging read with unique characters trying to survive in a bizarre, yet recognizable setting.  Dick offers a stern warning against the folly of nuclear war from a unique angle.  Instead of railing against the weapons, he points out the deep psychological damage that a person could incur by having such power at their fingertips.  As always, he tells an interesting story from an unexpected point of view.  While not on par with \\"The Man in the High Castle\\", it is nonetheless an excellent representation of his work that can be enjoyed by newcomers and die-hard fans alike.	2002-07-06
US	48242885	R1O117VLCLCWHZ	0553379267	284019128	A Canticle for Leibowitz (Bantam Spectra Book)	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A pinnacle of the genre	\\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\\" represents not only the best of the \\"apocalyptic fiction\\" genre, but it is also one of the most unique, for two reasons. First, the story takes place in three unique segments over the span of about 1800 years. The first section corresponds roughly to the early Dark Ages, the second to the Renaissance (with the benefit of 20th century technology as an example) and the third to what we might expect of the 2200's barring self-annihilation. What links these otherwise disparate periods is the second unique feature of the book: the use of a Catholic monastery as the setting for the bulk of the novel. In much the same way that monasteries preserved classical thinking through the Dark Ages, so to does the Albertian Order of Leibowitz preserve 20th century learning, often to their dismay.<br />This use of religion may strike some as odd, even sacrilegious, but it is a surprisingly effective vehicle for Miller's consideration of the morality of mankind. His purpose is to consider whether humanity's pursuit of knowledge comes at the cost of our happiness and our very souls. Only the backdrop of an institution as long lived as the Church would prove suitable for such an endeavor. Furthermore, while it's only fair to admit that I am Catholic, I don't believe that you need be religious, or even believe in God to appreciate this novel. Miller's arguments are more moral than religious; the monastery just provides a vehicle for his discussion.<br />As for the story itself, it is absolutely fascinating, all \\"big picture\\" elements aside. One might think that a story told over such a great span of time would be disjointed, but that is not the case at all. Miller creates a fascinating picture of a world clawing its way out of the horror of nuclear holocaust. In the first section, the world has reverted to ignorance as the survivors of the war (the \\"Flame Deluge\\") have turned their backs on science and literacy in revulsion at what \\"progress\\" wrought. Only Saint Leibowitz, a former nuclear scientist, and his followers struggle to preserve learning. In the second section, mankind has begun its rebirth, and looks to the \\"Memorabilia\\" as a touchstone to progress. Finally, in the third section, mankind has once again placed itself above nature and is prepared to reap the horrors it has created. Yet even at this bleakest point of global déjà vu, Miller sees hope. Technology is not inherently evil, in fact it's neutral, and while it does give us the power to destroy ourselves, it also gives us the ability to save ourselves and try to avoid the mistakes of the past. Hopefully, it will even grant us the ability to break the vicious cycle of man's fall from grace.<br />Throughout the novel, actions in one era echo through the others, such that seemingly insignificant events take on great importance in later chapters. Often funny or ironic, and frequently sad, this resonance is Miller's way of trying to show there is hope in the lessons of the past, even as he predicts a bleak cycle of violence. At the same time, it is fascinating to follow the rise of political dynasties and the evolution of life on earth over 1800 years. Not only does Miller create an arc than spans two millennia, but he plugs in little asides and historical footnotes that bring great depth to his creation.<br />\\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\\" is a powerful novel, rich in both story and moral and intellectual thought. It is a dire warning against mankind placing itself above nature, but it is also a fascinating, brilliantly conceived and executed story. It rightly ranks as a classic of the Cold War era, but is no less powerful for having been written 55 years ago. Whether you are looking for apocalyptic sci-fi, thoughtfully commentary, or just an enjoyable read, \\"A Canticle For Leibowitz\\" has it all.	2002-06-30
US	48242885	R37SW1D83KRQ3T	0345444388	397145373	The Scar (Bas-Lag)	Books	5	232	240	N	Y	Another remarkable achievement by Mieville	In \\"The Scar\\" China Mieville has proven that \\"Perdido Street Station\\" was no fluke, he is a force to be reckoned with in the literary world.  Once again he returns to the world of Bas Lag, although this time he journeys outside the confines of the city of New Crobuzon.  In fact, his characters travel the length and breadth of Bas Lag, as they are the occupants (willing and unwilling) of the floating pirate city, Armada.    It would be nearly impossible to recount the plot here, both because of its complexity, and the risk of spoiling it.  However, there are a few general points that I think bear mentioning.  First, while this is not a sequel to \\"Perdido Street Station\\" it does reference events in that book; there are no common characters, but the protagonist, Bellis Coldwine, is fleeing the city as a direct result of the happenings in the prior novel.  While one could easily read \\"The Scar\\" without any knowledge of \\"Perdido Street Station\\" I would still recommend reading it first, as your appreciation of \\"The Scar\\" will be greatly enriched as a result.    Second, \\"The Scar\\" is a darker, more ambiguous novel than its predecessor (which was by no means cheery to begin with).  It is not an easy beach read for the summer; while it is immensely entertaining, it is also monstrously complex and intensely thoughtful.  This is really a novel that needs to be read without distractions and with a great deal of thought as to what is going on.  There are a lot of subtle themes and messages in this book, and it needs to be approached in a manner more befitting \\"literature\\" rather than your average \\"sci-fi\\" (I use quotes because SF can obviously be literature, I'm just speaking in stereotypical terms).    Which brings me to the writing; anyone who read \\"Perdido Street Station\\" would have to agree that Mieville is a master of his craft.  There are few writers today who have the same grasp of the English language; Mieville absolutely revels in the descriptive abilities of the written word.  I would read an atlas if Mieville wrote it just to see how he described the landforms contained therein.    He is also intensely interested in exploring human nature across its entire spectrum.  From compassion to cruelty, Mieville is fascinated by our motivations.  If one reads an interview with him, it becomes obvious that Mieville wouldn't mind being cast as the anti-Tolkien.  While giving a nod to Tolkien's creation of an entire world down to the smallest details, Mieville revels in his characters' moral ambiguity and indecision, as opposed to Tolkien's characters who always know where they stand.  Furthermore, while Tolkien used his races to highlight different ideals, Mieville uses his vast panoply of creatures to highlight the absurdities of racism and the nature of \\"humanity\\".    Finally, Mieville is a master of the metaphor.  I can say, without, giving anything away, that the Scar, of the book's title, is an actual place, but also a recurring theme throughout the novel.  All of the characters (which are so diverse and beautifully realized it is nothing short of breathtaking) have scars, physical and mental.  Some rise above them, some never come to grips with them, and some are brought low by them.  In the end, the Scar is, at its most simple level, a double entendre.  It is the heart of darkness of the world of Bas Lag, but it is also that heart of darkness within the primary characters that draws them to their destiny.  In the end, some of the characters refuse to have their future dictated by the scars of their past, while others wallow in their pain and meet their end.    I could go on indefinitely, and not even scratch the surface of the message in this book.  However, I have covered the key elements I took away from the novel; I'll leave it for others better versed than I to continue the discussion.  Ultimately, \\"The Scar\\" is a novel of immense emotional depth.  The characters are brilliantly written and act upon a world stage that is breathtaking in its scope.  It is a highly entertaining adventure in the finest nautical tradition, but it is so much more.  It is an exploration of the depths of our ambition and the foundations of our humanity.  Do yourself a favor and read this novel (and carefully), it will not disappoint and it will leave you thinking for a long time to come.    Jake Mohlman	2002-06-25
US	48242885	R1ACDCJ759XKC2	031286504X	486151984	I Am Legend	Books	4	2	3	N	N	"I Am Legend" is great, but skip the other short stories	As the title of this review indicates, this book is not just \\"I Am Legend\\".  In fact, it only makes up about half of the book, the remainder being made up of what I found to be rather pedestrian short stories.  I found this to be rather irksome as there is absolutely no mention anywhere on the book that it contains work other than the title piece.  Other than \\"I Am Legend\\" I thought the stories were rather weak Bradbury rip-offs and not worth any particular note.<br />That said, the title piece is writing of the highest caliber.  \\"I Am Legend\\" is the story of the only man who has survived a plague that has turned the remaining population into vampires.  Admittedly, that sounds rather uninspired, but what gives the plot its heft is that Matheson approaches vampires from a scientific viewpoint.  As the main character struggles to survive, he cuts through the legend surrounding vampires and comes up with a scientific explanation for them.<br />At the same time, he is forced to struggle with his own loneliness and the encroaching madness that it inspires.  He is not altogether sympathetic, but through him Matheson explores the crushing hopelessness that those who are alone feel.  Rather than trying to make a sympathetic vampire, he turns his main character, a normal human, into the freak, the outcast, and explores how reacts.<br />In addition to the interesting psychological elements, there are some intriguing Cold War overtones within the novel.  Matheson's vampires seem to have elements from Soviet Russia: they are brutal and coarse, but not necessarily evil, just different.  Matheson seems to be arguing that the root of the Cold War (the brutality of the Soviet system acknowledged and aside) doesn't stem from competing ambitions but from inherently conflicted world views.  That's not entirely true, but when one considers that \\"I Am Legend\\" was written in the 1950's that view seems oddly dead on.<br />\\"I Am Legend\\" is a superb, albeit unconventional, vampire novel.  It is also an intriguing work of apocalyptic fiction.  Above all though, it is an examination of the nature of being different, and the fragility of the human psyche.is also an intriguing work of apocalyptic fiction.

US	48242885	RARXXFQK92J7	0449213013	750649906	Earth Abides	Books	4	13	16	N	N	A little dated, but still a good read	First off, I should state that this novel was written in the late forties, and thus reflects many of the prevailing attitudes of the time.  It is rather sexist, and even vaguely racist (although neither element is malicious, just ignorant) so if you think that may ruin the novel for you, then you probably want to skip it.  That said, if you can look at \\"Earth Abides\\" in the context in which it was written, you will find a thoughtful, entertaining novel.<br />\\"Earth Abides\\" is predicated on a super-virus wiping out the overwhelming majority of the Earth's human population, while leaving the rest of the animal kingdom unaffected (at least directly).  The story follows \\"Ish\\" as he struggles both to survive, and come to grips with the loss of civilization.  Over time, a community of survivors gels around him, and they work to scratch an existence out of the ruins of San Francisco.<br />Stewart takes a rather bleak view of the survivors of the holocaust, not to mention their children.  Rather than trying to reestablish \\"civilization\\" they slip into a more or less Stone Age existence, supplemented by the leavings of a culture they are completely alienated from, and that is not understood by the children at all.  While I understand that Stewart was seeking to comment on what makes up a \\"civilization\\", and what the natural human condition is, or should be, I think he introduced an element of wishful thinking into his narrative (strange as that may sound).  It is extremely unlikely that things as fundamental as literacy would completely disappear within two generations, and while they might very well fail, I suspect that survivors would at least attempt to maintain electricity, water supplies, etc.<br />Where this novel really shines, and what I found most interesting to read, was Stewart's descriptions of the ecology of a North America largely depopulated of humans.  He does a superb job of predicting the fluctuations in various animal populations, and I believe that the long-term balance that he predicts is probably not far from what would actually happen.<br />Ultimately, \\"Earth Abides\\" is an entertaining novel that leaves one thinking about how they would react in similar situation.  While I don't necessarily agree with the way the novel plays out, I was constantly challenged to come up with an explanation as to why I thought things might be different.  In the process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the depth of Stewart's characters, and the challenges he pitted them with.  If you enjoy \\"apocalyptic fiction\\" this is definitely a book for you, but even if you have not strong feelings for the genre, I suspect you will enjoy the excellent characterizations, thoughtful story and wonderfully realized world.	2002-06-18
US	48242885	RB80PSCVUE9JY	0833028855	639045937	Swarming and the Future of Conflict	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Excellent introduction to a new theory of combat	First off, it should be stated that this is by no means a full book.  Rather, it is more of a fleshed out briefing paper.  That said, the authors have done a superb job of positing a new theory of combat and have gone to some lengths to establish it in the context of military history, and to consider some of the potential strengths and weaknesses of this nascent doctrine.<br />Swarming, or \\"BattleSwarm\\", as the authors refer to it, might be considered the logical endgame of maneuver warfare theory: small, highly mobile, highly lethal, and most importantly, largely autonomous units that converge on a point (either with force or fire) from all directions, and then disperse until called upon again.  This mode of attack has the advantage of maximizing the application of fire when needed, while minimizing the exposure of friendly units to PGM's and massed enemy formations when not.  To a degree, this is what we have seen American forces do in Afghanistan, but that was a result of ad hoc planning born of necessity.  What the authors propose here, however, is a complete rethinking of the military (primarily the Army) to effectively engage in this new kind of fighting.<br />As one might expect, of paramount importance to the success of BattleSwarm is the development of networking technologies that can allow widely dispersed units to communicate with each other and command elements in an effective fashion.  Moreover, the authors point out the need for a new command doctrine that will limit micromanaging of the battlespace, on the one hand, and insufficient coordination of assets on the other.<br />Ultimately, this study is just a first step, albeit a critical one.  I fully expect that the authors will flesh this work out into a full-fledged book that will seek to overcome some of the difficulties they have outlined.  In the meantime, this briefing provides a valuable framework within which to evaluate our successes and failures in Afghanistan (it should be noted, this was published prior to 9/11).  It seems that military, out of necessity, is moving in the direction that has been outlined here, and as a result, understanding swarming and its application will be critical for anyone interested in the shape of our armed forces in the years to come.	2002-06-09
US	48242885	R27DSFUWR7WAN8	038550098X	591346591	Last of the Amazons: A Novel	Books	5	33	35	N	N	Another modern epic from Pressfield	For those of you who felt that Pressfield's last book \\"The Tides of War\\" was a little slow, you'll be pleased to hear that his newest book, \\"Last of the Amazons\\" is more on par with \\"Gates of Fire\\".  While not quite as engaging as that novel, it is packed with every bit as much historical detail and tons of action.<br />While still set in Ancient Greece, \\"Last of the Amazons\\" strays slightly from the formula of its predecessors.  Whereas in his first two books Pressfield wrote novelizations of actual historical events, in \\"Last of the Amazons\\", he explores the semi-mythological era of early Athens.  As always, this novel is impeccably researched and laid out in a highly plausible way, but even the author admits that his story is speculative, at best.  However, that in no way detracts from what is a great historical/military novel.<br />As anyone who has read his prior novels knows, Pressfield excels in writing the story of the mayhem and brutality of combat.   I have not encountered a single other author who can make the sweat, blood and fear of close combat come alive like Pressfield.  Furthermore, he has a knack for capturing the language of the time, such that his prose reads like something far older than it actually is.  That's not to say he's another Homer, but he does capture the spirit of the epic genre in a highly effective manner.<br />While I didn't empathize with the characters in \\"Last of the Amazons\\" as much as I did in \\"Gates of Fire\\", they are perhaps even better written.  \\"In Gates of Fire\\" Pressfield had real historical figures, in a real battle to work with, one that had a tragic and foregone conclusion.  As a result, the reader knew the destiny of all the actors, and therefore developed a level of pathos for them that transcended the writing (which was still excellent).  In \\"Last of the Amazons\\", however, Pressfield is writing about figures that are more rooted in mythology than history, so he had to flesh them out a great deal more, and succeededadmirably.  He has created some genuinely tragic and conflicted figures that are incredibly complex.  Moreover, he has proven that he can write believable, strong, female characters, which were noticeably (albeit understandably) absent from his first two novels.<br />Finally, since Pressfield was able to stray from, and manipulate, the historical record, this novel has a much stronger message than his prior ones.  He makes a powerful statement about redemption, and explores at some length what constitutes civilization and civilized behavior.  <br />In conclusion, \\"Last of the Amazons\\" is an outstanding read.  It has breathtaking battle scenes, but also is very thoughtful.  It is a great adventure, but also extremely well written.  In short, it is an excellent novel: enjoy!	2002-06-06
US	48242885	R1WPM9TEYQM5Y5	0802137970	623008639	India: A History	Books	3	94	106	N	N	Thorough but dry and overly detailed	Before I commence with my review I feel I should state that my knowledge of the history of the Indian sub-continent was limited, at best, prior the reading this book.  However, I am well versed in history in general, and I believe that my readings on other topics have provided me with a valuable frame of reference for my review of Keay's \\"India: A History\\".<br />Without a doubt, Keay set himself a daunting task; \\"India\\" the nation-state is the end result of colonial policy and modern politics and does not in and of itself represent the extent of Indian culture or the breadth of its geography.  In effect, Keay undertook a task equivalent to writing a history of pre-European North America in one volume.  One item that will stay with me from this work is just how fractured and variegated the Indian Sub-Continent's people are.  Unfortunately, even after acknowledging the difficulty of the task he set for himself, I am afraid that the author fell short.<br />It certainly wasn't for lack of effort or detailed historical research.  Quite the contrary, in fact; the reader is pummeled page after page with a barrage of dynasties and kingdoms, that to the non-expert seem to blur into one.  While politics are undeniably critical to any history, Keay all to often ignored cultural and religious developments while examining political ones in excruciating detail.  Of particular note was the scant attention he paid to the evolution of Hinduism.  I realize that this is supposed to be a broad overview, but considering the role Hinduism has played in India's development, I feel an examination of it would have been worth a chapter, at least.<br />The one area where I felt Keay got things right was the Indian drive for independence from the British.  From about 1850 on, he seems to develop a real passion for the material and injects some vibrancy into what had been a very dry narrative to that point.  While some reviewers have complained of a pro-British bias, I found the writing to be very well balanced, and if anything, nominally pro-Indian.<br />Unfortunately, even in the modern era, the writing continues to be uneven.  For example, he examines the rise of the Congress Party in great depth, but offers almost no detail on the Indo-Pak wars.  Furthermore, after going to great lengths to discuss India the Sub-Continent (as opposed to the country) Keay has almost nothing to say about Pakistan in the post-partition era.<br />In the end, this isn't a terrible history, but it is terribly uneven, and incredibly dry.  I definitely took away a greater knowledge of India and a better understanding of its history, but I was left wanting more.  Perhaps that's the nature of any one-volume history, but I think it owes more to Keay's dry delivery and under appreciation of the sub-continent's cultures and religions.  If you're new to Indian history, this probably isn't a bad place to start, but it is by no means a definitive work.	2002-06-03
US	48242885	RM18DW1DCHJGR	0446530220	622113275	The Cabinet of Curiosities (Pendergast, Book 3)	Books	5	66	69	N	N	Another great read from Preston & Child	Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's seventh novel has been a long time coming, but it was well worth the wait.  It represents, without question, their best writing to date.  As always, the scene is set with great skill, but now their talent for set piece drama has evolved into excellent characterization and superbly subtle plot development.<br />It would be difficult for me to describe the story without spoiling the plot, but I can safely say that \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" is a diabolically twisted thriller.  What starts out as a seemingly standard, albeit very creepy, serial killer mystery rapidly develops into something far more bizarre, and vastly more sinister.  I read a lot, and it is rare that I am caught completely off guard by plot twists, but with one hundred pages to go I was hit with not one, but two!  The authors deftly throw the reader off guard at a key moment, which makes the concluding chapters absolutely breathless.<br />As I alluded to earlier, the writing in this novel is outstanding; \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" is much more thoughtful than their earlier novels, and significantly darker.  While still showing their roots in the \\"techno-thriller\\" genre, Preston and Child have branched out into considerations of love, madness and morality.  Whereas their earlier novels certainly told a great story, and contained tragically flawed characters, this novel makes an excellent stab at exploring the heart of darkness in a much more methodical, dare I say, literary, way.<br />Of particular note in this regard is the character of Pendergast.  For those readers who are unfamiliar with \\"Relic\\" and \\"Reliquary\\", he is an FBI agent with remarkably refined tastes, and equally unorthodox methods.  The best way I could think to describe him would be if you turned Hannibal Lecter into a good guy (while is in no way insinuating that he was ripped off, which he clearly wasn't).  At any rate, he was always an intriguing character, I would even go so far to say that he was the authors' best to date, but he was also somewhat two-dimensional.  Mystery is one thing, but it can come at the expense of character development.  \\"In Cabinet of Curiosities\\", however, Pendergast has been given an enormous depth of personality, and his background has been revealed in such a way that deepens the mystery surrounding him even as it injects him with a sense of pathos.  He is now a fully realized, and immensely interesting character that I look forward to encountering again.<br />Ultimately, \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities\\" will make a great beach read for the summer, but it is much more than that.  It is a well-crafted, very suspenseful and deeply thoughtful novel that should ranks among the best popular fiction of the year, and I recommend it highly.  Finally, my praise for this novel should in no way be construed as disparaging to the authors' prior books; I have bought, read, re-read, and enjoyed the all.  It is just that in this novel, Preston and Child have taken their writing to a whole new level and I felt it bore mentioning.  If you haven't read their other novels do yourself a favor and order them at the same time as this one.<br />Enjoy!	2002-05-31
US	48242885	R3827DX5H6VCDO	0375406956	127846038	My Name Is Red	Books	5	34	36	N	Y	A great mystery and a thoughtful message	\\"My Name is Red\\" would be a fascinating novel in any era, but in this time of profound, and seemingly growing, disconnect between East and West, it is all the more compelling.  By using the clash between traditional Islamic art and the budding realism of the Renaissance, Pamuk strives to shed light on the conflicted nature of Islam and traditional societies in general.  In using the Ottoman Empire of the late 16th century as his setting, he sets the reader into a place and time where the Western world and the Islamic world were in conflict both intellectually and militarily, much as they are today.<br />This conflict operates on three levels.  The first is the most obvious, and drives the story, which is a brilliantly conceived and diabolically executed murder mystery.  The reader follows the trail of the murderer through the voices of a host of different characters, including the murderer himself, and some of the artwork he and his fellow artisans have created.  As the novel progresses, the reader comes to realize that this murder has occurred because of a conflict between the traditional method of manuscript illumination and the method of using perspective to create lifelike images.  What is unclear is whether the murder occurred to protect or overthrow tradition.  The reason for this obscurity is that the killer himself seems uncertain as to the correctness of his actions and thus engages in a running internal moral debate.  His internal conflict is in many ways a microcosm of the conflict in the era in which he lives.<br />The second conflict is found in the love story that underlies the mystery.  As Black, one of the murder victim's nephew, pursues the killer, he is also pursuing his uncle's daughter, Shekure, who he has loved for most of his life.  However, she is trapped, both by a tradition that leaves her bound to her husband, who presumably has died in battle, and by her uncertain feelings towards Black.  Shekure is perhaps the most remarkable character inthe book, as she struggles to make her own path in a society that has little tolerance for the needs or opinions of women. While not the core argument of the book, Pamuk makes a strong argument for how absurd it is to completely disenfranchise half of society for the sole reason that they happen to be female.<br />The final conflict is more subtle, but lies at the heart of the novel's message.  It is a consideration of the results of cultures colliding and merging, and what happens when they are either unable or unwilling to adapt.  Pamuk seems to suggest that Islam, while an inherently good religion, is far too rigid for its own good.  By exploring the torment of artists who must choose between the traditional methods they have preserved for centuries, and the European method that is clearly the future, he parallels the crisis society as a whole faces when it fails to change.  His characters feel compelled to make their choices based upon obscure religious dictates that have long since masked the true purpose of Islam's teaching: that God's creation is beautiful, and that man does Him honor by acknowledging it and living a good life.<br />In the end \\"My Name is Red\\" cuts to the heart of the conflict in which we find ourselves today.  Islam, as a religion is deeply spiritual and has the potential to be a profound force for good.  Unfortunately, Islam as a dogma has reverted to medieval forms that are completely incompatible with modern life.  Pamuk uses the Ottoman Empire because it became rigid and collapsed, and it therefore serves as a cautionary tale to those who would attempt to stop time in its tracks.  He has created a beautifully written, thoroughly researched and fiendishly clever mystery that also carries a message of profound importance.  \\"My Name is Red\\" is a rare novel that is both entertaining and thought provoking, and I highly recommend it.	2002-04-11
US	48242885	R103YO5AXY472T	0553109200	119744907	The Years of Rice and Salt	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	Rich, Multilayered Alternate History	First off, if you are looking for a traditional Alternate History in the vein of \\"Fatherland\\" or \\"Resurrection Day\\" this may not be the book for you.  While it is true that this novel takes place in a world in which Europeans (and hence Christianity) were wiped off the face of the earth in the 14th century, the primary focus isn't a simple \\"what if?\\"  Rather, Robinson uses this altered world to explore the nature of humanity and civilization.  Furthermore, since the novel as a whole takes place over hundreds of years, he uses the mechanism of reincarnation to keep his main characters in play.  While this may sound a little hokey, Robinson handles it with a deft touch and provides a tenuous, but palpable link between what would otherwise be a series of short stories.<br />It is difficult to describe the plot of the novel because, as I indicated before, there isn't one per se.  Rather, Robinson explores three primary themes.  The first of these is the nature of individual humanity and belief; by juxtaposing Islamic and Chinese culture against a vanished Europe, he points out that on an individual level, people aren't really different across cultures.  We all share the same hopes and fears, and even when our desires are expressed in different ways, they all stem from the same root emotions.<br />This consideration, in turn, leads to his second primary theme: culture.  Specifically, is one culture inherently superior to another?  There are a great many people who would argue that the death of Europe would have removed tremendous suffering from the world.  Robinson argues that this is not the case, since all cultures evolve over time, and since all people are basically the same, war and injustice and suffering would have dogged the planet one way or the other.  That's not to say that he thinks history would have unfolded basically unchanged, but it is unrealistic to think that European civilization was more flawed than the alternatives.  Compared the European states, Islam and China were equally repressive and totalitarian.  Thus, it is only thru trial and error, and the sincere efforts of individuals that progress is made.<br />Which brings us to the third and final theme: hope.  Robinson uses the final chapters, which occur after terrible trial and destruction, to discuss the nature and use of history.

US	48242885	RZ3GAK4GCCJUU	0312878060	98235474	Maelstrom (Rifters Trilogy)	Books	5	28	28	N	Y	Dark, gritty fiction	First off, if you haven't read Peter Watts' first novel, \\"Starfish\\", don't start with \\"Maelstrom\\".  While this is theoretically a stand-alone novel, the reader unfamiliar with \\"Starfish\\" will miss out on a tremendous amount of back-story and character development.  ... <br />As for \\"Maelstrom\\" itself, Watts has easily cleared the high bar he set with his first novel.  All too often, sequels are rehashes of old conflict, but that is not the case here at all.  Watts takes his already complex characters from the first novel and adds several more layers of texture; at the same time he adds just enough new characters to keep things interesting.  These characters are equally well developed, and overall, Watts' writing is even sharper than in the first book.<br />The writing has to be sharper, because this is a much more complicated novel than the first.  While \\"Starfish\\" took place in the relatively limited space of a deep ocean outpost, and dealt primarily with human interactions, \\"Maelstrom\\" sprawls across the Pacific and North America and a significant portion of the action takes place in cyberspace.  Moreover, the plot is significantly more complicated.  I don't want to get into it in too much detail, as doing so would ruin much of \\"Starfish\\" for those who haven't read it.  But the general theme of this novel, like its predecessor, is the impact that the unforeseen consequences of exponentially growing technology can have on humans as a species and on the planet as a whole.  In a dystopian setting of environmental havoc and human violence, two new scourges have emerged.  One is spawned by nature, the other, inadvertently, by man.  The result is a bizarre, but believable synergy that threatens the entire biosphere.  It was particularly interesting how Watts explored the nature of consciousness by subtly comparing the burgeoning life of a piece of code with the flawed memories of the main character.<br />By now you may have guessed that there is a lot of science in thisnovel, and you'd be right.  There is a great deal that is cutting edge, and even more that is purely speculative.  Watts makes use of some pretty heavy biology and AI science that may intimidate readers at first blush.  It would be a mistake to avoid this novel for that reason because the science is just there to set the stage for the story.  If you understand the detail of it, it definitely adds many intriguing twists; but if you only understand it at the surface level, you could still easily follow the story.  That's the beauty of Watts as a writer: he's pigeon hold as hard-SF, but the SF is just a means to the end of writing incredibly complex, beautiful characters struggling with problems we can easily empathize with.  Finally, Watts has included an appendix discussing the key science in some detail, and also provides a bibliography of sources he used.<br />\\"Maelstrom\\" is an outstanding novel set in a believable, terrifying future.  It was undeniably entertaining and I tore through it at a breathless pace.  It also left me thinking about technology and its impacts in some new ways.  Watts is no technophobe, but he makes a strong point about the lack of responsibility in many arenas of scientific endeavor.  \\"Maelstrom\\" is a must read for anyone who enjoys a great story, rich characters and a thoughtful message.	2002-02-19
US	48242885	R38UEFFUDORJ8N	0812575857	792964844	Starfish (Rifters Trilogy)	Books	5	39	42	N	N	Taut, original science fiction	\\"Starfish\\" is an outstanding work of dystopian fiction taking place in the not too distant future.  As the demand for energy grows exponentially, mankind turns to the thermal energy from deep-sea vents as a solution.  Of course, the ocean floor is the least hospitable environment on Earth, and it takes a special breed to man these remote outposts...literally.    People who represent the dregs of society (child abusers, violent criminals, sociopaths) are genetically, psychologically and \\"mechanically\\" altered to survive in this harsh climate.  However, what no one counts on is what will happen when these same people fulfill their need for danger just by staying alive, and become, if not friends, then certainly allies.  Furthermore, no one considers what they might encounter in that ancient habitat, and what it will mean for the rest of the planet.    That's about all I can say about the plot without spoiling it, but this is definitely a book you will want to pick up, for several reasons.  First of all, the writing is absolutely breathless; Watts has perfectly translated the mind numbing pressure found at the ocean bottom into a palpable sense of tension that permeates the novel.  Secondly, his characters are brilliantly conceived and realized.  The reader never exactly feels sympathy for them, but they are incredibly complex and evolve in unexpected, but realistic, ways.  Finally, although this novel is classified as \\"science-fiction\\" that really does it something of a disservice.  It's not that there's anything wrong with SF, but this novel is much more; it's about our insatiable demand for convenience, and what it's doing to our planet (both geo-politically and environmentally) and what it is doing to those who get left behind by the pace of change.    \\"Starfish\\" is a great read and a novel that will leave you thinking.  With an engaging plot, excellent characters and relentless pacing, it is a superb first novel.  In particular, if you are at all in interested inmarine biology, or even biology in general, then this is a must read for you.	2002-01-27
US	48242885	R1TYA8NRWNXPL7	0765303027	743536920	Dark Light	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Somewhat disjointed	Let me start off this review by saying that I really enjoyed \\"Cosmonaut Keep\\" both for the political intrigue typical of Macleod, and because of the fascinating circumstances in which it took place.  It is therefore with some regret that I can only give the sequel, \\"Dark Light\\", three stars.  Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad book, and by the standards of most science fiction it was a great book, but it really wasn't up to Macleod's usual high standards.<br />The plot picks up where \\"Cosmonaut Keep\\" left off: with the familiar cast of characters traveling to the planet Mingulay.  Unfortunately, right off the bat the writing gets awkward.  Gregor and Elizabeth, the two main characters from the first novel, have a role in the first twenty pages, and then completely disappear for the next 150.  Now, I understand that Macleod is looking for an epic feel, with a large cast of characters, but it really interrupts the flow of the novel when two important characters fall completely off the radar.<br />As the novel continues, we learn of Matt Cairn's quest to solve the mystery behind the origination of the Second Sphere, and later, having received his answer, engaging in political-military intrigue to equip Mingulay to meet its fate.  Unfortunately, Macleod's touch isn't as deft as it usually is in this area.  The machinations of the characters seem more contrived than meaningful, and I was frequently left wondering why they were even bothering.  Motivations in this novel are muddy to say the least.  Also, Macleod on several occasions seems to be on the verge of delving into the nature of faith, but then he backs away, leaving interesting, but half formed, ideas on the page.<br />As I stated earlier, \\"Dark Light\\" is not a bad novel, and if you enjoyed \\"Cosmonaut Keep\\" you will definitely want to read it (if you haven't don't even attempt to start with this book, you'll be lost from the get go).  However, it falls short of Macleod's previous writings, and is somewhat disappointing as a result.  Still, it is does have some remarkable moments of adventure and imagination, and if you're looking for a quick, smart read, you won't go wrong with \\"Dark Light\\".	2002-01-25

Like its predecessor, \\"The Simpsons Forever!\\" is a must have for any fan of the show.  For those of you who don't own that first book, you'll want to pick it up as it is loaded with information on the first eight seasons.  For those of you who do own the first book rest assured that you aren't paying for duplicate information, this book only covers seasons nine and ten.<br />\\"The Simpsons Forever\\" uses the same grid format as the first book, which makes it very easy to find that favorite quote or missed moment.  Likewise, it is an equally high quality item, featuring the same beautiful color and heavy-duty paper.  Finally, it has some nice extras at the end, including a tribute to Troy McClure (the late Phil Hartman) and a listing of who does what voice (which has provided some closure to the endless guessing my wife and I subject each other too!).<br />If you are a fan of The Simpsons, you definitely want to pick this up.  Whether you read it cover to cover, or just keep it handy when watching the show, it is great fun.  Also, as the seasons are released on DVD, it will make for an excellent companion volume to the discs.<br />Enjoy!	2002-01-13

This beautifully printed and put together collection is the companion to an exhibition of Calvin &amp; Hobbes strips at Ohio State University.  While it doesn't comprise any new material, it is a must have for every Calvin &amp; Hobbes fan for a variety of reasons.<br />First, each cartoon is presented with the original, black and white sketch on the left, and the final, colored version on the right.  It is genuinely fascinating to see what color can do for a strip, and it was likewise interesting to observe the number of revisions that Watterson made.<br />Secondly, Watterson's introduction and his notes, which accompany many of the strips, offer wonderful insight into what the strips were meant to portray, and the artistic challenges he faced.  While this is similar to what he did in the Tenth Anniversary book, it is obvious that he has gained some perspective over the last six years, and his thoughts are rather more contemplative as a result.<br />Finally, this book is a much needed burst of nostalgia for the trying times we live in.  While it has only been six years since the last strip, it feels like much longer.  There's something about Calvin &amp; Hobbes that just exudes innocence and a simpler life.  It was genuinely refreshing to revisit Calvin's world, and I am now greatly looking forward to rereading all of the collections.  If you likewise long for the days when you could open up your newspaper and read this strip, you won't be disappointed by this collection.	2002-01-13
US	48242885	R1M139UYIF2FAS	1563116162	826789654	Air-Mech-Strike: Asymmetric Maneuver Warfare for the 21st Century	Books	3	7	9	N	Y	A good first start, but needs work	\\"Air-Mech-Strike:...\\" is a thorough, and much needed, look at how to restructure our armed forces for the 21st century.  Specifically, it recommends the creation of light, air-mobile forces to compliment our heavy (M1/M2) forces.  The purpose of this force would be to fill the gap between our heavy forces, which pack a tremendous punch, but have limited deployability, and our light forces that are easily deployed but have limited striking power and maneuverability.<br />This book truly shines when the authors are discussing the creation of this force; they have clearly done their research, and repeatedly make strong cases for the right type of equipment to acquire (or modify).  At the heart of their new force structure are modified M-113's (as a medium element) and modified German Wiesel's (as the light element).  They delve into detail as to why these systems should be chosen: there is a tremendous experience with these chassis and they are proven systems, they are easily modified for a variety of missions and they are easily maintained.  Most importantly, though, they are helicopter deployable/supportable.  Thus, they would provide the Army with a potent, sustainable strike package that could be inserted to maximum effect in areas unexpected by the enemy.<br />The authors go on to discuss at great length the structure, organization, implementation and finances of such a force structure.  I was particularly pleased that they found a role for the M8 AGS, a victim of ill thought out Clinton era budget cutting.  Of particular interest was their detailed discussion of the ability to implement this force with off the shelf components and vehicles.  For example, I was very impressed with, and intrigued by, their discussion of how to implement a hard-hitting recon/strike unit using primarily commercial (albeit modified) ATV's.  Finally, their discussion of the deployment of WIG (Wing In Ground) transports is highly warranted and long overdue.<br />As the title of my review indicates, however, there were some serious issues with this work.  Perhaps most glaring, for a discussion of a helicopter deployable force, very little discussion is given to the role of the AH-64 Apache, and there is absolutely no mention of the RAH-66 Comanche.  Considering that these two platforms will be the backbone of the Army offensive air fleet for the foreseeable future, I find this oversight puzzling, to say the least.  Along these same lines, at the same time that the authors are advocating smaller, more flexible units, they advocate the pooling of the bulk of Army Air at the Corp level without much in the way of explanation.<br />Finally, the actual physical layout of this book is appalling, almost embarrassing.  I cannot imagine how a book so loaded with spelling, formatting, and grammatical errors could have made its way into publication.  Moreover, the illustrations are frequently confusing and are often downright laughable (I almost choked when I saw a toy UH-60 used in an illustration).  Of course, content is always paramount, but it is difficult to take a book seriously if the authors aren't even willing to take sufficient time to assure that their ideas are cogently put forward.<br />There is tremendous merit in the work, and anyone who is serious about understanding the direction our armed forces need to take in the post-Cold War world would do well to read it.  As I mentioned though, it does have serious flaws.  If I could make a suggestion to the authors, it would be this: pull this edition, get together with the best editor, illustrator and map-maker you can find and reassemble this work to make it worthy of Simpkin and Macgregor, two authors you obviously (and rightly) admire.	2002-01-13

It is loaded with episode information, inside jokes, quick gags you might have missed and abundance of quotes.  It is great to have handy while watching the show, but it is equally fun to just thumb through; surprisingly, the Simpson family is almost as funny in synopsis format as it is on TV.  <br />Furthermore, this isn't just some cheap volume thrown together to make a quick buck.  It is printed on high quality paper, in full color, and the stills from the episodes are beautifully rendered (not like the grainy images you frequently see in TV and movie tie-ins).  Also, while it may not seem significant, each episode is described using standardized \\"blocks\\" (synopsis, Stuff You May Have Missed, etc.) so it is very east to quickly find information about a specific episode.  Finally, now that each season is being released on DVD, this book becomes even more useful as it acts as a companion piece to the discs.<br />This book is great fun, high quality, and a must have for any Simpsons-a-holic.  <br />Enjoy!	2002-01-13

The premise of this book is rather simple, excerpts of horribly mangled history taken from college students' exam papers and reassembled as a history textbook, but the results are hysterical.  I'm a history buff, as I expect most of the people drawn to this book will be, but there were some \\"facts\\" that were so badly mangled I couldn't even begin to guess what they were meant to refer to!  <br />The errors fell primarily into two categories, the grammatical and the idiotic.  An example of the first would be, \\"Chairman Moo\\" or \\"Auto von Bismarck\\", and these are relatively funny, especially when one considers the context.  However, it is the latter category, statements that are so divorced from fact as to be rendered absurd, that make this book painfully funny.  Following are some of my favorite examples:<br />*Men during this period were usually about thirty years old and women only twelve or thirteen.<BR>*Death rates exceeded one hundred percent in some towns.<BR>*Westward expansion ended at Custard's Last Stand and his later defeat at Wounded Knee.<BR>*The Pershing Gulf War began when Satan Husane invaded Kiwi and Sandy Arabia.  This was an act of premedication.<br />...and so on.  <br />One could probably take this as an indictment of the gross ineptitude of many of our nation's social studies teachers, and the gross indifference of their students, and one would probably be correct in doing so.  That's not really what this book is about though, rather, it is about poking fun at the lack of historical grounding of supposedly educated people, with hilarious results.  You have to laugh, because otherwise you'll cry, and this book is just too funny not to laugh.	2002-01-08

For one reason or another, though, it always seemed to get pushed behind another book.  Normally, when I enjoy a novel as much as I enjoyed this one, it would annoy me that I put off reading it for so long.  However, in light of September 11th, I'm glad that I did, for two reasons.<br />The first is that this novel reminds us of mankind's near infinite capacity for self-destruction, or at least creating the mechanism for it.  Osama bin Laden and his fellow psychopaths could only dream of the systematic cruelty the Soviet Union perpetrated on its own citizens, let alone the tightrope nuclear balance of terror that the superpowers walked.  However, they are cut from the same cloth, and it is lunacy to try to co-exist with them.  Moreover, the rationalization of the irrational, the attempt to explain the unexplainable (for instance how both the US and the USSR created strategies to \\"win\\" a nuclear war) can only lead to heartache.<br />Secondly, and most important, \\"Alas Babylon\\" reminds us of the indomitable spirit of man.  Even as his characters struggle to grasp some normalcy from incomprehensible nuclear destruction, they cling to that which makes them human: hope, love and faith.  While some may find it odd to be reading apocalyptic fiction in this time of war, I found this novel to be uplifting, an affirmation really, of the good we have seen around the world in the face of evil.<br />I realize I am going about this backwards, but for those of you not familiar with the plot, it runs as follows.  It is sometime in the mid-1960's (a rough guess) and the nuclear balance of terror has broken down.  The country is in ruins, the state of the world is unclear, and communities are left to fend for themselves.  The readers follows the lives of one small community in Florida for the first year following \\"The Day\\" as they struggle to survive and maintain the rule of law.  Frank masterfully captures the full scope of the struggle, from almost prophetic descriptions of weapons, tactics and strategy (the novel was published in 1958) to searing characterizations of people in crisis.<br />\\"Alas Babylon\\" operates on so many levels, it has something for everyone.  One could easily sit down and read it as an adventure/techno-thriller and come away completely satisfied.  It is also a rather scathing critique of war and the bureaucratization of the military.  It is not as simple as \\"war is bad\\" though, Frank argues through one of characters (a retired admiral) that while war, particularly nuclear war is insane, the price of peace is rational preparedness enacted by professionals, combined with a dialogue that humanizes the enemy.  Above all, though, \\"Alas Babylon\\" is a testimony to the ingenuity and compassion of man.  Yes, we have made mistakes, yes there is evil among us, but the majority of human beings are basically good when given the chance, and that, in these times as much as in the Cold War, is what we must never lose sight of.ule of law.

While one might think from its outlandish illustrations that it is a book for children, this is simply not the case.  That's not to say a ten or eleven year old wouldn't enjoy this book, but there's plenty an adult can take away from it as well.<br />Beginning with a basic review of the principles of biology and evolution, Dixon proceeds to apply them across a range of environments on an Earth 50 million years removed from mankind.  The result is a menagerie of remarkable creatures.  Remarkable in that they are frequently unique, even bizarre, but even more remarkable because they represent the result of a familiar creature's evolution.  Dixon's world isn't a fantasyland, every creature in it holds true to the principles he so effectively explains in the first chapter.   Moreover, they all fill an important ecological niche; he hasn't created 150 pages of carnivores.  Rather, he presents a balanced, albeit limited, ecosystem that sheds light on the state of our own environment today.<br />Beautifully illustrated and highly engaging, \\"After Man\\" is a must read for anyone interested in evolution and anthropology.  Furthermore, this book is educational without being heavy handed.  One by no means needs to be an expert to learn from and enjoy this very unique work.	2001-11-21

II	Books	3	23	26	N	Y	Long on history, short on speculation	When I first found out that there was going to be a \\"What If? 2\\" and that it wasn't going to focus exclusively on military matters, I was very excited.  As much as I am a fan of military history, I was very interested to see how historians of other disciplines might predict how our world could be different today.  Unfortunately, having finished the book, I am rather disappointed.  That's not to say that the quality of the writing, or the turning points are sub-par, they're not.  In fact, in terms of composition and selection of historical turning points, this book is actually more original and uniform than its predecessor.<br />That's what makes this book so disappointing: there is great potential, but it never lives up to its self-proclaiming goal of telling the reader \\"what if?\\"  The background research is solid, and the authors in almost every instance make a cogent, educated case as to why history turned on a given moment or person.  Unfortunately, in almost every instance they fail to follow up with any meaningful speculation.  In fact, there are very few alternate scenarios that extend for more than a few paragraphs.<br />Considering how successful the first volume was in regards to alternate histories, this volume's lack of them is inexcusable.  What else can the reader expect in a series entitled \\"What If?\\" than a detailed exploration of how our world could be different today.  The only explanation I can think of is that counter-factual history is an immensely useful tool in political-military history, but it is less so (or at least less utilized) in social history.  It therefore seems probable that many of the writers in this edition were unsure as to how to weave a different world after having identified their turning point.<br />At any rate, this isn't a terrible book, but it is pretty disappointing.  As I have mentioned above, the research and writing are excellent.  Furthermore the points of departure for are some of the most unique I've come across inalternate history.  Unfortunately, the \\"what if\\" scenarios never really pan out, and as a result the book never lives up to its title.  This book will get you thinking about some overlooked episodes in history, but it will, for the most part, be up to your imagination to supply the counterfactual.	2001-11-10

What it is not is a detailed history of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  That's not to say that one can't find lessons for our current situation, but they aren't the ones you might expect.  There aren't any clues as to how to fight the Afghans in this book, and the Soviet Army bears essentially no resemblance to our current force structure.  They were fighting a war of aggression, were ill led and were provided with almost negligent training.<br />However, \\"The Hidden War\\" provides tremendous insight into the Afghan mindset: why they fight (or don't), why their country lies and ruins, and why they have such conflicted feelings towards the West.  More than anything this book teaches us what we shouldn't do: We shouldn't try to hold large areas of territory, we shouldn't alienate the average Afghan with our superiority, we shouldn't disrespect their culture, however alien it may be to us.<br />If you're looking for a parallel to this work, I personally found myself time and time again thinking of Michael Herr's \\"Dispatches\\".  In the same way that he captured the nightmare maelstrom of drugs, violence and disillusionment that was the Vietnam War, so too does Borovik paint a picture of a hopelessly misguided Soviet effort.  He leaves no doubt as to the futility of fighting a conflict with no strategy (let alone tactics), no goals, and no support at home.<br />...	2001-11-02

That said, this novel labors under what can only be described as a pretension of being literature.  That's not to say that Forbes isn't a talented writer  Quite the contrary; in fact, she has an excellent grip on the English language and her characterizations are superb.  Unfortunately, these gifts are shrouded by frequent changes in voice, confusing use of fonts, and poorly delineated flashbacks.  It is almost as if Forbes is trying too hard to write something \\"important\\" rather than just telling the story to the best of her obvious ability.<br />That said, there is an excellent story at the heart of this novel, and in spite of the flaws outlined above I did enjoy it.  The reader follows the rootless Claire Fleetwood to London, and then the Indian Sub-Continent, as she searches for a personal history shrouded in the mysteries of an earlier age.  Part Michael Crichton, part travelogue; Forbes weaves a remarkable trail of murder, adultery, botany, etc. while delving into the nature of \\"self\\", and how our past (and our forebears' past) determines our future.<br />I have enjoyed both of Forbes' books, and I look forward to her future endeavors.  However, I think that she will make great strides as a writer when she abandons her tendency of trying to write \\"literature\\" and gives free reign to her creativity.  In the end, \\"Fish, Blood and Bone\\" is a flawed, but nonetheless enjoyable work by a writer whom I firmly believe is on the cusp of greatness.	2001-10-24
US	48242885	R5E1ZCOAQK1IG	1857531353	655026865	Race to the Swift: Thoughts on Twenty-First Century Warfare	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Powerful, forward thinking military theory	\\"Race to the Swift\\" is a sweeping review of military strategy, organization and logistics that has suffered little for being 15 years old.  Yes, the NATO references are dated, but they in no way impact a core thesis that is even today ahead of its time.  That said, this not an easy book to read; in spite of Simpkin's rather engaging, almost conversational writing style, the material is technical and dense.  Moreover, given the comprehensiveness of the work, the reader will sometimes find himself or herself losing focus.  However, if you are a student of military theory, and comfortable with the field, this is a book well worth the time it takes to read.<br />As one might imagine, \\"Race to the Swift\\" is a call for speed and stealth in military action.  It's not just about technology, however; Simpkin goes to great lengths to examine political/home-front issues, logistics, and military hierarchy.  Ultimately, though, these all serve as supporting evidence for his core argument: that the current heavy mechanized divisions of today are too slow in light of the incredible increase in available firepower on the modern battlefield.  As an alternative, he calls for armored, stealthy, heliborne cavalry.  Traveling in something akin to airborne tanks, capable of deploying on conventional tracks when necessary, these new formations would deploy off of submersible helicopter carriers.  Obviously, this thinking is more revolutionary than evolutionary, some of it even smacks of science fiction, but the core validity of his argument, that an exponential increase in speed is called for, is undeniable.<br />Of particular note for the times we live in are the final few chapters, especially the last one.  In them he examines what it means to \\"wage war\\" in the age of non-state actors.  His arguments on the use of Special Forces backed by the appropriate application of conventional forces seems to have been borrowed wholesale by the planners of our operations in Afghanistan.  Also very interesting is Simpkin's exploration of the legal language necessary to maintain the integrity of our western values in our post September 11th world.<br />In the end this is a work of immense value.  As I said earlier, though, the reader has to be committed to taking something out of it.  When you are, when you look past the Central European staging for the writing, you will find a work that is rich in both theory and practical application.  The way in which it relates to our current situation is almost uncanny, and the guideposts it offers for the future are immensely valuable.  I suspect that in the years to come we will hear many of Simpkin's ideas being revisited.  The nation in general, and our leaders in particular would do well to pay them heed sooner rather than later.interesting is Simpkin's exploration of the legal language necessary to maintain the integrity of our western values in our post September 11th world.<br />In the end this is a work of immense value.

The problem with satire is that the person writing it frequently has an axe to grind.  As a result, it will inevitably be offensive, and hence unappreciated, by a significant portion of the population.  The Onion has rather ingeniously avoided by this conundrum by mocking everyone and everything.  I don't care what group you choose to affiliate yourself with, you're not human if you aren't laughing out loud, with tears streaming down your face, by the third page of \\"Dispatches from the Tenth Circle\\".<br />What the brilliant \\"Our Dumb Century\\" did for the 1900's, so too does this book for current events.  Through the medium of newspaper \\"articles\\", political leaders, musicians, actors, sports heroes, popular culture, etc. are lampooned with brutal accuracy.  Most amazing is that in a book that contains literally hundreds of articles, almost all of the entries are remarkably literate.  I can only describe them by suggesting that the reader imagine what it would be like if Dennis Miller edited the New York Times.  Even when the humor turns lowbrow, as it sometimes does, it is so matter of fact that one can't help but laugh.  There's no pretense, no embarrassment, just a deadpan delivery of frequently surreal material.<br />This book is not for the easily offended, so if you hold your views and idols sacrosanct, skip this one.  However, is you can stand to have that which you hold most dear skewered, and laugh about it, you will not regret purchasing this book.  In fact I think former VP Al Gore's (I'm a registered Republican, so you can see what strange bed-fellows this book can make) statement on the back cover puts it best: \\"This publication is destructive to our shared values.  Read it yourself and you'll see what I mean.  Seriously, what else could make me laugh - much less laugh uproariously - while being offended week after week.?\\"	2001-09-06
US	48242885	R1VE7Z2QUIY2KF	0345447832	383802287	The Surgeon	Books	3	8	9	N	Y	Great premise, adequate execution	Tess Gerritsen's \\"The Surgeon\\" starts out with a bang and the first 150 pages are as tense as any I have ever encountered.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book doesn't hold up to the promise of these early pages.  This is due in large part to flaws in presentation and characterization, rather than with holes in the plot.<br />As I mentioned, the book starts off well enough; women around Boston are being found mutilated in a particularly gruesome and yet surgically precise manner.  Even more baffling, these killings are nearly identical to ones that occurred two years earlier in Savannah, GA.  What makes it baffling is that that killer is undeniably dead.  The only connection seems to be the one surviving of the first killer and as the \\"Surgeon\\" draws ever close to her the tension mounts.<br />Unfortunately, Gerritsen proves to be unable to maintain this tension throughout the whole novel.  The primary reason for this is that her characterizations vary markedly.  Those of Detective Moore and Dr. Cordell, the two main characters, are superb.  They both show tremendous depth and have very complex personalities.  Unfortunately, many of the other primary characters and most of the secondary characters are just cliches: the beaten down female cop, the man hating women's clinic doctor, the chauvinistic male cop, the laconic New England store owner, the insular southern cop, etc., etc.  It's not that I don't expect such slap-dash characterizations in most \\"popular\\" fiction, it's that Gerritsen is clearly capable of writing much better ones.<br />Furthermore, as the book heads towards its climax, Gerritsen seems to be writing more of a tribute to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" than her own work.  There are several undeniable similarities that I won't cover in detail for fear of ruining the plot; I will say, though, they left me rather deflated.<br />In the end, \\"The Surgeon\\" is not a bad read.  It kept me up late a few nights, especially early in the novel.  By the conclusion, however, I felt that the author had largely abandoned what seemed to be a really original premise.  If you're just looking for a quick read on the beach or the plane, you won't by any means be disappointed by this novel, but it could have been much more.  If your looking for a mystery that leaves you thinking, I would recommend \\"Raveling\\" by Peter Moore Smith, or \\"Bombay Ice\\" by Leslie Forbes.  \\"The Surgeon\\" seemed to be heading down the same path as these two novels, but just came up short in the end.owever, I felt that the author had largely abandoned what seemed to be a really original premise.

At the same time, familiar fauna from the Ice Ages never went extinct; wooly mammoths, saber tooth tigers and giant sloth, among others, still roam the Earth.  These differences make for a unique, and yet disturbingly familiar world.<br />However, it is not Barlough's surplus of creativity that sets him apart, rather, it is his writing.  Everything about it is incredible: his use of language is superb, his pacing strings you along at a perfect level of tension, and his characterizations are without parallel.  What I enjoy most, however, is something less concrete...he creates a world of detail that would be excruciating to describe, and that is yet fascinating to read.  Every aspect of the characters' lives are examined: meals, style of dress, mannerisms, their surrounding geography, etc.  Barlough definitely values the journey as much as the destination.  While not all of the pages in this novel are directly pertinent to the conclusion, it is an absolute pleasure just to visit his world for a while.<br />As for \\"House in the High Woods\\" in particular, fans of his first novel will not be disappointed.  While it exists in the same world and general chronology, it is by no means a sequel. Rather, it is what looks to be a series of examinations of a familiar, and yet fundamentally different Earth from a variety of perspectives.  Of particular note, I found that \\"House in the High Woods\\" was much more disturbing, much more likely to keep you up at night than its predecessor.  As the characters delve ever deeper into the dark mysteries of the small town of Shilston Upcot, the reader will findit almost impossible to put the book down.<br />Fans of \\"Dark Sleeper\\" will definitely enjoy this novel, perhaps even more than the original.  Barlough's writing, already very solid in \\"Dark Sleeper\\" is even sharper, and the plot is much more engaging.  To those readers new to the author, I highly recommend both novels, and I see no particular advantage to reading one or the other first.<br />Enjoy!	2001-08-17

Tolkien: A Biography&quot; by Humphrey Carpenter is a remarkable look at the life, and particularly the mind of one of the most admired authors of the twentieth century. What it is not, is a discussion of his literature, and its merits and meaning. Off course, as one would expect, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, et al. , loom large, but they are not the primary focus.<br />Rather, this is a surprisingly personal look at Tolkien the man. The reader follows him from South Africa, to being an orphan in early industrial England, to the trenches of France in WWI, and to an academic life in Oxford. As one follows this arc, one truly begins to appreciate what drove Tolkien to write his masterpieces. His deep loves of nature, language, family and, most surprisingly, religion all reveal themselves as key elements in his writing.<br />Most interesting, perhaps, is the very thorough examination of his career as a philologist, his actual profession. One cannot truly appreciate the enormous depth of his work, without first appreciating his fascination with this rather arcane field, and how it drove him to create a whole new world. What started as an exercise in linguistics evolved into what is, arguably, the most beloved book ever written.<br />Carpenter has done a great service to Tolkien's literary tradition. By presenting him as a whole, remarkably complex person, he has done much to dispel the stereotype that has come to surround him. Moreover, by exploring his truly outstanding academic credentials, one might hope that the ignorant perception held by many, that his writings are merely glorified fantasy, might be dispelled. This is truly a critical work for anyone who seeks a better understanding of this remarkable man and his remarkable works.	2001-08-13

The authors do a superb job of pointing out the root causes of warfare, and why it is naïve to expect that armed conflict has gone by the wayside.  They then go on to point out the challenges to American global preeminence, and what needs to be done to assure it.<br />Specifically they look to precision-guided munitions as the key weapons of future combat, and space as its primary battleground.  They make compelling arguments for each, particularly regarding the obsolescence of the primary weapons of today's Pax Americana: the tank, the strategic bomber, and the aircraft carrier.  Furthermore, the completely debunk the myth of nuclear supremacy on the modern battlefield.<br />The problems with this book that I alluded to are twofold.  First, the editing is appalling; there are numerous typos and misprints (for example, referring to a torpedo that can travel at 400 knots).  While the knowledgeable reader can usually infer what the authors' intent is, editorial errors always make for a frustrating reading experience.<br />The second concern cuts to the heart of the book.  While the authors do a superb job of defining the future battlefield, they offer very little in terms of how we get there from where we currently stand.  The weapons systems they describe will almost certainly come to pass, but they neither make suggestions as to the allocation of R&amp;D dollars, nor offer any sense of what research should receive priority.  In the absence of such commentary, their bold assertions frequently seem more like dogma than scholarship.  Moreover, they ignore potential doctrinal changes that might extend the service life of current weapons systems while increasing their effectiveness.<br />At its best, `The Future of War' is a visionary look into the future of armed conflict.  The authors correctly grasp the dawning senility of the weapons currently deployed, and paint a bold picture of what the future battlefield will look like.  Unfortunately, while brilliantly describing the future, they completely ignore the near to middle term.  As a result, `The Future of War' while well worth reading, can only be treated as half of an equation.  One must read the works of authors like Leonhard and MacGregor to truly appreciate the shape of the modern battlefield.	2001-08-09

Over the course of thirty vignettes, Einstein dreams of the various courses through which time might flow (or not flow).  What I found to be most intriguing was that the author played upon our perceptions of time in each dream.  For example, we have all felt like time is moving slower for us than everyone else, but what if this were actually the case?  What if you actually could \\"seize the moment\\"?<br />While this a very short book (I read it in less than 2 hours), it really leaves you thinking about how we spend our time.  By taking things we all wish we could do, like stopping time in its tracks, and making them physical constants, Lightman sheds a lot of light on to the way we can waste our time, and our lives,<br />\\"Einstein's Dreams\\" is a delightful novel that reads almost like poetry.  Although cautionary about taking time for granted, it is not judgmental, and makes no claim to the correct use of one's time.  If you're looking for a novel in the traditional sense, you'd do well to pass on this book.  However, if you're looking for an easy, yet insightful book, this is one for you.<br />Enjoy!	2001-07-26

In considering Ralph Sawyer's translation of \\"The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China\\" one must look at the work from two angles.  First, one must consider the quality of the translation, and how well the author has set the historical stage for the piece.  Second, one must consider the pieces themselves, and their pertinence to modern strategic thinking.<br />Regarding the first issue, Sawyer has done a superb job in both his translation, and in his historical research.  The prose is easy to read and understand, but the essential, almost poetic, essence of the original language has not been sacrificed.  Furthermore, each piece is prefaced by a brief, but detailed, overview of the work including a biography of the author, or possible authors, and a synopsis of the historical context in which the work was created.  In addition, the book is heavily footnoted, which allows the reader to fully comprehend each piece, without the primary texts being chopped up.<br />Regarding the second angle, I was genuinely astonished by how pertinent theses works are to modern military thinking.  For such primitive (chronologically, not intellectually) works, they do a superb job of capturing the key elements of strategic thinking: maneuver, logistics, terrain, combined arms and command hierarchy.  Moreover, they are extremely sophisticated in their consideration of Grand Strategy and the mobilization of the population.  While these works are by no means a blue print for a modern army (the codes of conduct are draconian, to say the least), they undoubtedly provide a framework for the analysis/planning of modern operations.<br />This is truly a superb work that captures both the philosophical and the practical aspects of some of the most ancient books on the planet.  Furthermore, it is a fascinating look at ancient Chinese history.  It is truly a must read for anyone interested in military theory or international relations, particularly with China once again ascendant on the world stage.	2001-07-23

In \\"Treehouses : The Art and Craft of Living Out on a Limb\\" Peter Nelson has come about as close as is possible to capturing the sheer joy of a treehouse in print.  Through the use of beautiful photographs and ebullient prose he reveals the little kid in all of us that is just itching to climb a tree.  He discusses the different forms that a treehouse can take: from a ramshackle affair built by children, to veritable mansions among the leaves.  He also strives to capture what it is that makes a great treehouse; he seems to believe (and I agree) that a great treehouse isn't reflected so much in outer beauty, but in how it mirrors the essence of the tree itself.<br />Which brings me to a final point: many of the other reviewers have expressed concern about the fate of the trees.  Let me reassure them that Nelson, both in his sample designs, and in his own constructions, encourages (and even lauds) limiting the use of nails driven into the tree to the bare minimum.  In fact, he goes so far as to posit a treehouse constructed with no nails driven into living wood as an ideal.<br />This is a wonderful, engaging book.  Anyone who has ever enjoyed climbing trees, or had a treehouse, or who wants to build a treehouse would do well to buy a copy.  It is both an intriguing look at the architecture of these fanciful abodes, and a celebration of their spirit of freedom and escape.<br />Enjoy!	2001-07-19

At the center of the novel, the reader finds Francis Orme, the narrator, and resident of `Observatory Mansions', which is the subdivided remains of his ancestral home.  Alongside Francis live characters that are so bizarre that one would consider them cartoonish if it wasn't for their heartbreaking psychoses.  To reveal their mental disturbances, both collective and individual, would give away much of the plot, but it is sufficient to say that the element that holds them together is the \\"self-institutionalization\\" that they have inflicted on themselves and each other.<br />On the surface, Francis is the most outwardly normal of the cast of characters, although this isn't saying much.  He wears gloves as a literal representation of the mental barriers he has placed between himself and the world.  He collects what is in essence garbage, because he sees it as having been loved, and therefore uses it as a proxy for real love.  However, his carefully constructed world, and those of his apartment-mates, come crumbling down with the arrival of a more spiritually rooted resident.<br />I think this is where a lot of the other reviewers have a complaint with this novel.  I have yet to see a critique of the authors prose, which is reminiscent of Saramago's \\"All the Names\\", and I have seen no argument with his characterizations, which are superb.  Rather, I think readers are disturbed because this book is about the power of the human spirit, and its ability to mend itself.  Not all of the characters ride off into the sunset, but they don't all wither and die either.  It is in this range of outcomes that Carey most effectively considers his core subject.  The negative reviews of the ending I have seen put me in mind of the reaction one gets to the 21st chapter of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" in which Alex is starting to weary of his brutal life.To paraphrase Burgess, what is the point in examining the human condition if it always ends in misery?  That's not life.<br />\\"Observatory Mansions\\" although a caricature, is life.  It is sad and bizarre, but it is also hopeful and uplifting, and that's life.  Carey has written an excellent novel, and I expect further greatness from him in the future.	2001-07-10

McRaven has written a comprehensive, thoughtful, theory of special operations.  In so doing, he has taken a field of arms that is shrouded and myth and bravado, and applied rigorous logic to it; the end result of which is both a useful tool for the analysis of past operations, and a guidebook for future ones.<br />The key to this work's success is that it cuts through the mayhem, and \\"seat-of-their-pants\\" view that most people have of special operations, and breaks them down using simple, constant analysis.  First McRaven considers the overall mission: Was it worth the risk?  Was it executed according to plan, and if not why?  What could have been done better?  He then goes on to identify six key components of any special operation: Simplicity, Security, Repetition, Surprise, Speed and Purpose.  He correctly points out that weakness in any one of these areas can be compensated for, to a degree, by strength in the others, but they all must be present to some degree.<br />Finally he considers the most critical aspect of any special operation; Did/can the attacking force achieve and maintain relative superiority over the enemy?  I say critical because by definition the special forces will never have absolute superiority, it is only in their ability to temporarily achieve superiority that they can have any hope of success.  McRaven, observes that failure to achieve relative superiority must inevitably result in a failure to achieve objectives at the minimum, and disaster at the worst.<br />By analyzing eight classic special operations, McRaven proves the merits of his theory time and again.  Over the course of fifty years and a host of political environments, he illustrates the overarching validity of his arguments.  In so doing he has provided both the special warrior, and the military historian alike with a powerful, valuable tool.	2001-07-04

Stroyar has written a novel of immense creativity, startling realism and remarkable emotion.  While it functions brilliantly as an example of the \\"alternate-history\\" genre it is also much more.  By imagining a Third Reich that existed into the 21st century, Stroyar provides herself with the perfect backdrop to explore the central themes of this novel: humanity, hope, compassion, revenge...I could go on, there are so many.<br />At its core,  \\"The Children's War\\" is the story of Peter Halifax a victim of unspeakable Nazi brutality.  After years of humiliation, servitude and beatings, he escapes to the Polish Underground; however, his hopes of a more simple, free, life are shattered as he faces the judgement of people who barely even understand what they are fighting for.  That's where the novel gets its name, the resistance is fighting for something completely intangible, they are children who have never known freedom, or Poland, or justice, as anything other than a concept.  In their quest for survival they have had to make so many compromises their resistance has become almost ritualized.  Furthermore, their necessary isolation has calcified many of their views to the point where they are almost as prejudiced, although not as brutal, as the Nazis.<br />Therein lies the central dichotomy of the novel.  Peter is appalled at the accommodations that the Poles have made with the Nazis in order to guarantee their survival.  At the same, the Poles judge Peter for having done what he needed to do to survive, without having ever been in a similar position; always safe in their \\"Ivory Bunker\\".  Ultimately, they are both right and both wrong; in a world of constant warfare, everything is shades of gray.  The characters come to realize that humanity is something that you carry in your heart and your mind, not necessarily in your actions.<br />In terms of the narrative writing and characterizations, I was blown away.  The writing was among the best I have ever encountered, which is all the more remarkable since the author is a first time novelist.  In particular, Stroyar avoided the pitfall that many authors fall into when writing alternate history: to much information.  All to often the authors feel the need to explain in painstaking detail how they arrived at the time the are writing about.  Not so Stroyar, who clearly understands that a well drawn present with sufficient, but not overt, background information is more important than the reverse.  Furthermore, Stroyar has a superb grasp of politics, both international and domestic.  She understands perfectly the stasis that totalitarian regimes must inevitably fall in to, and the introverted inertia that so plagues democracies at peace.  <br />The characters are brutally real, they exhibit an incredible range of emotion, and while not always sympathetic, they are always human.  There were actually times when I had to stop reading this novel because it was just too gut wrenching.  Of course I couldn't stay away for more than 15 minutes, but I have never been affected by a novel that way.<br />At this point it's fairly obvious that I loved this novel.  \\"The Children's War\\" is a great alternate history, it is a great spy-thriller, but mostly it's just great literature.  It is a work of tremendous depth and is profoundly moving.  Not only does it entertain, but it makes the reader think; both about the world today, and about what might have been..  In the end, I can't say anything more than, \\"READ THIS NOVEL!\\" you won't regret it.	2001-06-24

Lot's of novels are though; what sets \\"The Alphabet Man\\" apart, however, is its unique style, brilliant language and disturbing exploration of the psyche.  The novel presents itself as a manuscript written by the delusional protagonist.  As he slips deeper and deeper into madness the voice changes to reflect his multiple personalities, and the layout and fonts become more and more bizarre.  Thus, Grossman accomplished the feat of telling the story not only with words, but with images as well.  <br />In fact, in many ways this novel looks and reads like a precursor to the incredible \\"House of Leaves\\" by Danielewski.  Although not as good as that remarkable novel, it certainly belongs on the same shelf.<br />Ultimately, \\"The Alphabet Man\\" is a superb exploration of madness, and of perception versus reality.  While some readers may find the unusual format tedious, a careful reading reveals a gripping, thoughtful story.	2001-06-14

What if a killer philosophically justified his murders in advance, and what if modern science, on some level, supported those justifications?  <br />I don't want to give away the plot, but suffice it to say that Kerr's Earth of the 2020's is a dystopia in the classic tradition.  On the surface, everything is OK, as technology has made work easier and play more intense.  At the same time, though, the technology has subtly stolen the freedom of the indivdual and blurred the lines between right and wrong.  As a result, the villain lives in a world where a logical moral argument can be made for the murder of society's undesirables.  Is murder wrong if it removes potentially dangerous (genetically identified) people from society?<br />\\"A Philosophical Investigation\\" succeeds as a futuristic thriller without any literary pretensions.  The characters are deep and well drawn, and the future England is realistic.  However, it is those \\"literary pretensions\\", that set this novel apart and that will leave you thinking.

US	48242885	R2OB3LD9QNQB0I	0425167720	89472327	An Instance of the Fingerpost	Books	4	14	14	N	N	An original take on a tired genre	\\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" does so many things right, it's hard to know where to begin.  First and foremost, I guess, is that unlike most modern mysteries, the reader actually remains in suspense for much of the book.  Which leads my second point, the remarkable way in which the book is written.  Rather than one long narrative, the reader is provided with four, each from a different point of view, and each approaching the central mystery from a different point.  As a result the reader is introduced to many plot threads that seem significant, only to have them snipped off later in the novel.<br />Furthermore, Pears does a superb job of capturing the spirit of the time.  His use of the English language is impeccable, as the dialogue possesses a distinct 17th Century feel.  More impressive, however, is his ability to write an engaging novel, using real people as characters, without disrupting the actual timeline of events.  Of course the central story is fictional, but it operates seamlessly within historical fact.<br />\\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" is not just an excellent mystery, it is an excellent work of literature as well.  The characters are incredibly well drawn and grapple with their consciences to a remarkable degree.  It is undoubtedly a novel that leaves the reader thinking about right and wrong, and about how they might have acted in similar circumstances.<br />In conclusions I offer two warnings.  First, read this book in the shortest time you can; the longer it takes you to read it, the more likely you are to forget key points from the various narratives.  Second, since the story is presented in four parts, the novel starts out a little slow.  Stick with it, though, and you won't be disappointed.	2001-06-13

The characters have real depth, and the writing moves at a brisk, tense...but not hurried pace.  In fact, the authors do such an excellent job of cranking up the tension in one long, slow pull, I felt almost physically drained upon finishing it.<br />Of particular note, the authors have succeeded in writing a novel that operates on two levels.  In the tradition of \\"On the Beach\\" by Shute, \\"Fail-Safe\\" is both a gripping novel, and a thoughtful commentary on the almost absurd politics of the Cold War.  The authors examine what was at the time a very real concern about the hair-trigger between peace and global destruction; the concern that machines were supplanting humans.  In so doing they reveal more about the mentality of the Cold War than many works of history.<br />In the end, \\"Fail-Safe\\" does a superb job of capturing the terror of the Cold War.  It succeeds as both a thriller, and as a work of thought provoking literature.  Enjoy!	2001-05-30

While by no means a comprehensive review of either 20th Century Europe, or even its politics, \\"Dark Continent\\" thoroughly examines the nature of the modern European state.  At its most fundamental level, \\"Dark Continent\\" takes as its thesis that the view of the modern European state as naturally democratic is definitively false.<br />It is perhaps obvious that Europe has been dominated by totalitarian regimes, whether fascist or communist, during the 20th Century.  What is perhaps less obvious is the degree of intrusion which supposedly enlightened governments inflict on their populations.  He correctly points out that socialism in its varied forms has frequently been (and continues to be) an excuse for greater government control.<br />Ultimately he shatters the myth of a tendency towards European democracy and freedom.  While Nazism and the USSR serve as overt reminders of this fact, it is the less obvious examples that drive his point home.  By way of conclusion, he does not dismiss the European Union out of hand, but argues strongly that it is in no way a result of an evolutionary process.  In other words, there is nothing in modern European history that indicates that it was either foreordained or that it is guaranteed to succeed.<br />\\"Dark Continent\\" is a remarkable book that should be read for two interrelated reasons.  The first is that if one assumes a natural benevolence in the political systems of Europe, one can not possibly hope to understand modern European history.  On a related note, without a firm grasp of its past, it is impossible to understand what is going on in Europe's present, or to predict what may happen in its future.	2001-05-15

Unfotunately it comes up short.  the premise is intriguing enough; pick up with characters from &quot;The Forever War&quot; and see what they've been up to.  In particular, I was excited to see how nearly 25 years had changed Haldeman's perspective about his characters and the universe he had created.<br />In the beggining it looks like he'll be up to the task.  The characters are superbly written and the pace of the book is excellent.  Unfortunately, as the novel progresses, these attributes are never built upon.  Ultimately the book doesn't really go anywhere; I don't want to give away the plot, but towards the end, Haldeman doesn't seem to be able to unravel what he has created, so he resorts to the fantastic.  That's fine in some instances, but it's out of place here.<br />This was a novel that I really wanted to like, but in the end it just fell short.  It was too rushed, and didn't make use of a solid foundation.  While I can't say that I hated it, I didn't love it either.  Ultimately, &quot;Forever Free&quot; wasn't a bad way to kill and afternoon, but it hasn't really stayed with me.	2001-05-15

I generally don't like mysteries, but &quot;The Church of Dead Girls&quot; is so well written, so intriguing, I couldn't help but like it.  The primary reason is that it is not what one would consider a &quot;traditional&quot; mystery.  Yes, there are murders and multiple suspects; but there is also an intense examination of the psychology of small towns and the nature of human darkness.<br />Dobyns' makes the reader think even as he entertains.  By introducing a host of less than reputable suspects he keeps the reader on their toes right up until the end.  At the same time, however, he is also pointing out the darkness and suspicion we all carry inside of us.  He recognizes that the primary difference between a &quot;normal&quot; person and a &quot;monster&quot; is as much restraint as anything.  Furthermore, his characters are superbly written, and yet enigmatic.  One can't help but feel that their actions and motivations are the same as one's own acquaintances.<br />&quot;The Church of Dead Girls&quot; has it all.  It's a creepy, engaging thriller with plenty of twists, and it's also a very thoughtful, thought-provoking novel.  It is well worth reading.	2001-05-14

As usual, he has created a world that is by turns familiar, in other words it has its basis in a plausible future Earth, and completely bizarre.  The bizzare aspects, in this isntance, being an earth-like planet that is home to humanoid (and regular) dinosaurs, native humans, and humans from Earth, and starships piloted by giant squid.<br />Much like his previous books, Macleod has filled this one with quirky, conlicting (and conflicted) politcal theories.  It is in this regard that he shines as one of the smartest authors around today.  He writes with the authority of a polical scientist, but never comes across as dogmatic.  I suspect that in real life he is left of center, but the politcal philosophies his characters espouse are really just vehicles to drive the plot.<br />Finally, one positive, one negative.  On the positive side, the characters in &quot;Cosmonaut Keep&quot; are Macleod's best yet.  They show a level of depth that is just amazing; a level I didn't find in his previous works.  On the negative side, &quot;Cosmonaut Keep&quot;, like Macleod's other novels is told in alternating time periods.  This proves to be a very creative way to intertwine seemingly disparite storylines, but it is handled poorly in the first half of this novel.  Macleod should have been more careful in the details he reveals, as I found myself hopelessly confused 50 pages in.  In the end all becomes clear, but this is a tough novel to get into as a result.<br />Ultimately, though, &quot;Cosmonaut Keep&quot; is a smart, entertaining beginning to what promises to be a great series.

The two novels, in terms of characters, setting, etc. are in no way related.  In their message they certainly compliment each other, but one is by no means a prerequisite for the other.<br />As for the novel itself, &quot;Forever Peace&quot; is outstanding.  While it is ultimately not quite as powerful as &quot;The Forever War&quot; it is also a lot more plausible.  The world in which it takes place is disturbingly familiar to our own, and it is by no means unlikely that we could end up there in the relatively near future.<br />Like &quot;The Forever War&quot;, &quot;Forever Peace&quot; operates on two levels.  On the one it is an exciting, engaging read with great chracters and technology.  On the other, it is a serious examination of societal and politcal issues.  To examine these issues here would give away some of the plot; suffice it to say they are both familiar and pressing.<br />In &quot;Forever Peace&quot; Haldeman has written a novel that is both cautionary and hopeful.  It is both and enjoyable read, and a book that will keep you thinking.  To my mind, that's the best kind.  Enjoy!	2001-05-08

In clear, eloquent prose, Toth introduces the reader to the genuinely surreal existence of people who live out much of their lives in dark, man-made catacombs.  With both the eye of a scientist and the compassion of a concerned human being, Toth examines what has driven these people underground, and how it is they exist in such an environment.<br />This book is astonishing in that something that reads like a bizzare work of fiction is in fact true.  It is hard to believe that people could or would live in subway tunnels. but Toth's reporting is compelling.  My one complaint is that she didn't do much to research the architetural aspects of sub-surface NYC.  I suspect she would have done much to silence her critics if she had mapped her travels and compared them to available blue-prints.	2001-05-08

On the one hand, it's loaded with action, has great characters and technology and is just a great read.  On the other hand, it is a surprisingly thoughtful novel.<br />Haldeman isn't just telling a story; he's examining why the human race seems to be constantly incited to violence, and the impact that violence has on us.  His particular concern is the impact on the young soldiers drafted into an impossible conflict.  In much the same way that soldiers in Vietnam faced an unknowable enemy with no home front behind them, so to do his characters face the ultimate enigma (an alien race) hundreds of millions of miles from home.<br />Simply put, &quot;The Forever War&quot; is just an outstanding novel.  Full of violence, compassion, dread and hope, it will stay with you long after you have completed it.  Enjoy!	2001-05-08

Powers does a superb job of blending the best elements of fantasy and spy thrillers into a remarkably creative novel.  The real key to the book is that it covers old ground from an entirely new angle.  Instead of looking at the stories we know from the Cold War, or the ones that probably happened (or could have happened), Powers instead takes something fantastic and makes it believable.<br />I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but the basic premise of the novel is that significant aspects of the Cold War revolved around magic, or more generally, the occult.  In their race to triumph, the adversaries deal with powers they can't truly understand.  What makes &quot;Declare&quot; believable, however, is the author's blending of real historical figures into the novel.  In fact, the famed British traitor Kim Philby plays a pivotal role.  Powers achieves this &quot;blending&quot; without disrupting any of the timeline of what actually happened, which makes the novel all the more real and gripping.<br />If your tired of the same old rehashing of the Cold War you get from most thrillers, give &quot;Declare&quot; a try.  The writing is superb, the characters are well drawn, and the plot is incredibly original.  Enjoy!	2001-05-07

Unfortunately, most won't, but if just a few of our leaders would, we'd be on the right track.<br />&quot;While America Sleeps&quot; is an engaging, insightful work of comparative history.  Using Great Britain between the wars as a point of comparison for the US today, the authors outline the great dangers we face as a nation.  In much the same way that Britain demobilized after WWI, the US has taken a huge &quot;peace dividend&quot; and gutted it's military since the end of the Cold War.  Furthermore, US foreign policy has been consistently erratic, misguided and timid over the same period.<br />By using well known examples like Iraq, North Korea and the Balkans, the authors illustrate how the US has failed to make a strong stand when confronted with aggression.  Furthermore, when a stand is made, it is usually ineffective and half-hearted. <br />They describe how the Bush (the 1st) administration had many of the right ideas about the role of a lone superpower, but failed to implement them.  This was due largely to a failure to educate the public, and a lingering &quot;Vietnam Syndrome&quot; that continues to plague the military.  They go on to lambast (and rightly so) the Clinton administration for both failing to understand the dynamic of global relations, and for utterly misapplying military force.<br />Make no mistake, while the Kagan's have a point to make, this is not a work of theory.  The history is excellent, and makes superb use of primary sources.  It is the quality of the research and writing, and the urgency of the conclusion that make this book.  The author's opinions are clear, but neither dogmatic, nor partisan.	2001-05-01

I say misleading because &quot;moral&quot; implies that the author will be shoving his own personal world view down the reader's the throat.  Thankfully, this couldn't be further from the truth!  Rather moral refers to the value judgements the characters in each of these stories is forced to make; decisions which form the crux of each story.<br />The stories are already outlined in Amazon's review, so I won't rehash them.  Two points worth making, however.  First, each story is unique, and remarkably imaginative.  They bear comparison in terms of the characters' feelings and decisions, but the similarity ends there.  Second, Girardi is a remarkably talented writer, with a style very reminscent of Poe.  The stories are frequently dark, even brooding, but their careful crafting and obvious literary merit save them from being tedious.<br />&quot;Vaudeville of Devils&quot; is a unique collection of wonderfully rich short stories.  Even better, the theme of moral crisis will leave the reader chewing over them for some time to come.  Enjoy!	2001-04-26

I say &quot;rather simple&quot;, because the author goes to great lengths to prove it.  There is actually nothing simple about his argument, as geography encompasses climate, suitability for agriculture, native fauna, natural resources, etc.  Furthermore, he needs to revise his argument for North and South America, Australia, Africa and much of Asia, to account for  different variables in each locale.  <br />Finally, after laying out and backing up his thesis, he applies it to a walk through of modern history, and identifies why Europeans were so successful in dominating the rest of the globe.  He is no apologist for brutality and slavery, but he correctly points out that the diseases the Europeans brought with them were the overwhelming cause of death and defeat for indigenous cultures around the world.  In turn, these diseases were the result of the urban lifestyle Europeans had.  A lifestyle supported by easily farmed grains and domesticated animals.<br />Of course, it's all much more complicated than that, and Diamond does a superb job of walking the reader through his thesis in well written, easy to digest chapters.  A background in evolution, biology or sociology will certainly enhance the readers understanding/enjoyment but it is by no means necessary.  My only complaint about this work is that Diamond tends to belabor points long after his case is made.  A zeal for thoroughness, however, is a small complaint about an otherwise excellent work.	2001-04-25

The author does a superb job of condensing literally tons of sources, and a host of viewpoints, to capture the essence of the war.<br />He does so by focusing on strategy; more specifically, the strategic dilemmas facing the major combatants.  For example, how the U.S. could maintain a &quot;Germany first&quot; strategy after Pearl Harbor.  He then goes on to capture the revolution in combat by considering the different kinds of battles fought in WWII. e.g. amphibious, airborne, urban, etc.<br />Overall, &quot;The Second World War&quot; is an excellent volume, whether for someone new to the field, or an old hand.  While the book is weighted towards the strategic/tactical aspects of the war, it is in these areas that Keegan truly shines.  He is, after all, the world's foremost &quot;military historian&quot; not &quot;economic&quot;, or &quot;politcal&quot; historian.  Even so, this work is still an excellent &quot;one-volume&quot; history of WWII.<br />Two final notes, one positive, one negative.  The bad first; for a work that focuses largely on strategy the maps are entirely inadequate.  Significantly more, and better, are required to capture the action being described.  On a positive note, Keegan does an excellent job of making use of combat photography to supplement his work.  While many authors of &quot;serious&quot; histories seem to shun illustration, Keegan realizes that a picture really can speak a thousand words...especially when it is capturing the horror of combat.	2001-04-21

In a very well rounded, easy to read work, he lays out both the scientific and humanistic reasons for a trip to the Red Planet.  While his science is excellent (he is a former Lockheed engineer), what is most compelling about this book is what Zubrin sees as the primary reason for Mars exploration: it is there.  He correctly asserts that humans are at their most creative and productive when they pit themselves against a major challenge.  He sees the exploration and colonization of Mars as a means of injecting the human race with fresh vitality and drive.  After reading this excellent book, I'm inclined to agree.	2001-04-21

I say less focused because in this work, Zubrin is considering a number of points for colonization (the Moon, Mars, asteroids, other solar systems), and a much broader time horizon.  Thus, as one might expect, his &quot;plans&quot; are less thorough than the one outlined in his previous work.  That said, they are equally sound at their core, and are rigorously supported through the use of easy to understand physics, chemistry, and even a little biology.<br />Most importantly, though, &quot;Entering Space&quot; reiterates Zubrin's core argument: that it is an human imperative to explore, and that the failure to do so can only negatively affect our species.  Ultimately, he's trying to get people excited about space exploration, to get them thinking about the enormous benefits, rather than the cost, and possible risk.<br />This is a wonderful, inspiring work that should be read by anyone who's ever dreamed of treading on another planet; and perhaps more so by those who haven't.

Most people have at least heard \\"Remember the Lusitania\\" which had essentially nothing to do with the U.S. entering WWI.  Few, however, are familiar with this short telegram that is truly a hinge on which history turned.    One cannot blame Barbara Tuchman for this, however, as this work brings alive the intrigue of the time like no other.  Reading like a spy novel, and yet all the more chilling because it's true, Tuchman navigates the reader through the murky waters of WWI intrigue.  We learn how, in a misguided effort to distract the U.S. from Europe, Germany sought to foment trouble on the U.S./Mexican border.  We learn how the British scrambled to inform the Americans of this, without comprimising their sources.  And we learn how a tortured President Wilson was forced to take the steps towards war.    \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" is history as it should be written; loaded with primary sources, and with the breathless pace that events really unfolded.  While better known for \\"The Guns of August\\", it is this work that makes me rank Barabara Tuchman as one of the best historians of the 20th Century.    Jake Mohlman	2001-04-21

By breaking away from the slavish attention to meter and literal transcription found in most editions, he has captured the true essence of the poem.  While not identical in timing, his well chosen language ripples with the energy and pace of the original.  Of particular note, I found that the sometimes uncomfortable dichotomy of Christian and pagan traditions to be revealed masterfully.  While there are dozens of interpretations of this poem, I've always felt that Beowulf, the man, was at least in part a metaphor for both the death of the pagan tradition, and the bith of the Christian one; and Heaney captures this beautifully.<br />This is really an oustanding translation that carries &quot;Beowulf&quot; into the twenty-first century with far more vibrance than it had in the twentieth.  Finally, if you're still not convinced, this translation features the original Old English on facing pages, if you feel like having a stab at it yourself, or just getting a better feel for the meter.	2001-04-18

It's almost inevitable; series like Williams' \\"Otherland\\", are so detailed, and involve so many characters, any satisfying resolution seems to exceed the author's grasp.  Not so in this case.    \\"Sea of Silver Light\\", wraps everything up nicely, but not hurriedly, and not without enough twists to keep you guessing right up until the end.  In my case, a few of my pet hunches panned out, but many others were way off the mark, and in most instances, I didn't even hazard a guess.  That's the beauty of this series, since Williams' operates outside of the world as we know it, the only constraint is his imagination, which is  top notch.  I would go on, but the risk of spoliers is just to great.    Furthermore, his writing has just gotten better and better as the series has progressed.  His character development is light-years beyond where it was at the beginning of the series, let alone his earlier works; and it was pretty good then.      For those of you who have stumbled across this book, find \\"Otherland: City of Golden Shadow\\" and order it now!  The whole series is predicated on a virtual reality network so realistic that it is seemless with the real world, to the point where if you die on the network, you die in real life.  As you might guess, this network contains a near infinite number of \\"worlds\\", each populated by a host of bizarre, fun, frightening characters.  Furthermore, William's pays tribute to many of his own literary influences by borrowing from Tolkien, Wells and Burroughs, to name a few.    At the same time, he carries on a subtle debate about what \\"life\\" really is.  Not only is this a well written, original adventure, but it's also a serious consideration of where technology is taking us as a species.    Jake Mohlman	2001-04-17

All to often they are insipid automatons, that exist for the sole purpose of populating spectacular worlds.  The authors of these novels have great creativity and imagination, but they never turn it into anything meaningful.<br />Not so, China Mieville, who creates characters who think and feel and have consciences.  In his masterful &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; he not only creates a city-state of remarkable depth and grit, but his characters are perfect fractal reflections of their environment.  Some are good, some are bad, all are troubled and burdened with doubt and fear; but they are also all complex and beautiful.<br />In a remarkable world that mixes science fiction with fantasy and populated by a jaw-dropping variety of sentinent life forms, Mieville examines what it is to be &quot;human&quot;.  That is to say he explores what it is to be passionate and compassionate, moral and amoral.  His characters struggle with &quot;right&quot; versus &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;self-interest&quot; with an astonishing depth.  There were many points in this novel when I was genuinely moved.<br />One last point, all allegory and subtlety aside, &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; is just an amazing read.  It has suspense, intrigue, action and romance, and it is all written in a remarkable (almost like Dickens recording a particularly vivd nighmare) style.

This novel is more of a &quot;what if&quot;; an examination of the ripple that one change in history might have.  I don't want to discuss the specifics for fear of ruining the plot, but suffice it to say that it involves the politics of modern day Russia.<br />Overall this is a strong novel.  Harris once again makes good use of real history to set the tone, and in this case displays an astute take on the political situation in Russia.  He wisely recognizes that freedom without prosperity can make people nostaligic for even the most brutal regimes.  Furthermore, in its latter stages, &quot;Archangel&quot; serves as a cautionary tale for the dangers of nationalism run amok.<br />So there is a lot of meat to this novel.  Unfrotunately, Harris hurries through the last 50 pages or so.  Of course, I understand the need to create a sense of urgency and pace to any thriller, but by the end I almost felt like he was just bailing out.  There were a lot of different paths that might have led to a more satisfying conclusion.<br />All in all though, &quot;Archangel&quot; is a strong political/thriller, which is let down, but not ruined, by a rather rushed conclusion.	2001-04-09

First, it is an excellent politcal thriller/murder mystery.  In the tradition of Robert Ludlum, the main character races around Europe with a palpable, yet generally faceless menace stalking his every step.  The writing is tight and fast, and will leave you breathless.<br />The second thing about &quot;Fatherland&quot;, and what sets it apart from Ludlum's works, is that it takes place in a masterfully realized alternate past in which the Germans are years removed from having won WWII.  By deftly incorporating historical figures into his narrative, Harris both reveals a solid understanding of Nazi politics, and makes the story all the more sinister.  In other words, the evil in the book doesn't have to be imagined, because we know all to well what it really was.<br />Finally, I know there are some purists who would argue that from the moment Germany invaded Russsia, and certainly from the moment it declared war on the US, it was doomed.  They may very well be right; but for the pruposes of this novel, it doesn't really matter.  The mere fact that victory didn't seem inevitable in the dark days of '40-'42 makes this shocking alternate history viable, and all the more real.<br />Enjoy.	2001-04-09

First, they tend to show the author's area of particular interest by focusing too heavily on one particular theater, at the expense of the rest.  The second, is that it is impossible to consider all of the aspects of the conflict with equal thoroughness.  Inevitably either the politcal, tactical, human, or economic aspect of the war will receive short shrift.<br />Weinberg overcomes this frequent fault by setting for himself a very particular area of study, and sticking to it.  In &quot;A War to be One&quot;, Weinberg looks at the war as a truly global conflict.  He is not so much concerned with the fighting, per se, as he is witht he personalities and policies that drove it.  He explores the nature of the various alliances, and pays a great deal of attention to the role of neutrals in the conflict.  He spends very little time on specific battles, rather devoting his attention to the campaigns as a whole, and their economic and politcal impacts.<br />&quot;A World at War&quot; is truly one of the top two or three books I have encountered on WWII.  Weinberg's thoroughness and tremendous research are worthy of the highest praise.  Furthermore, by giving equal attention to all areas of conflict, particularly some of the lesser known ones, the reader truly develops an appreciation for the &quot;world&quot; in World War II.<br />One note of caution, however, this is not a work for someone new to the field.  Very little of the build-up to the conflict is discussed, and names and places are usual treated as known quantities.  Also, I would recommend the excellent &quot;A War to be Won&quot; by Murray and Millet as the perfect companion piece to this work, as they focus exclusively on the operational aspects of the war.	2001-04-04

It is therefore understandable that is comes up somewhat short.<br />The primary reason for this is that the monster in &quot;Relic&quot; was so bizarre, and the setting so creepy, that to recreate to mood in a sequel would have required rehashing the original material. Make no mistake, Preston and Child avoid that pitfall admirably.<br />&quot;Reliquary&quot;, while it draws on material in Relic, heads in entirely new, and frequently unexpected directions. Most of the characters from &quot;Relic&quot; make encore appearances, and the authors do and admirable job of continuing their development.<br />Without giving any of the plot away, I can also say that the use of the NYC underground for much of the staging of the novel is a superb choice. It is close, but unknown, and captures completely the sense of the &quot;near-unknown&quot; found in every urban legend.<br />All in all, a great read. Enjoy!	2001-03-30

It is by no means an easy read; the prose can be dense and full of double meaning, the writing presupposes an understanding of Middle Eastern troubles, and the pacing is sometimes uneven.  However, it is all of these elements that make this such a great novel.<br />The very fact that it is not easy to read is what makes it so thought-provoking.  The reader must really take his/her time to absorb and digest every word.  The plot itslelf is complex enough; like a literary Ludlum, Stone navigates a maze of drugs, guns, greed and fanaticism.  Furthermore, beyond this, ultimately satisfying, surface, is a compelling look at the nature of belief and faith, and non-belief and a lack of faith, and how each can cause intolerance and mayhem.<br />&quot;Damascus Gate&quot; is a powerful, exciting novel.  It is also a novel that will leave you thinking about a lot of different issues, and about yourself.  In my opinion, those are usually the best kind.	2001-03-22
US	48242885	RLH9X7UOETL4W	0375700455	841119426	The First World War	Books	5	7	9	N	N	A truly thoughtful work on the Great War	There are two problems with much of the writing about WWI in the latter half of the 20th century: 1. It is frequently considered through the lens of WWII, which, while understandable, does nothing to enhance our understanidng of WWI and 2. It is frequently misunderstood just how much technology changed between the wars, and how that lack of technology impacted WWI.<br />In this wonderful work, Keegan avoids both of those pitfalls.  In regards to the former issue, the work stands alone; World War One is considered in the context of its own historical period, and biases from WWII are non-existant.  Whatever crimes the Germans may have committed in the 1930's and 40's, they have no bearing on this work.<br />In regards to the second issue, Keegan captures what is perhaps the greatest tragedy of WWI.  Most people assume that it was just a  slugfest, with no creative tactics being employed by either side.  That is only true in part, however, because that impasse we all know so well was only arrived at as a result of tactics that were more advanced than the technology of the time.  In fact, the entire German strategy was based around a massive flanking maneuver that was impossible to execute without significant motorized transportation that simply was not available on that time.  Moreover, he goes on to point out how what was essentially 19th century communication was being used on battlefields the dwarfed those of the preceeding century.<br />Ultimately, &quot;The First World War&quot; is a thorough, superbly researched work on WWI.  Keegan does an excellent job of capturing the politics of the day, and then drags the reader through the muck and horror of the trenches.  It is devoid of both bias from WWII and the technological arrogance of our day.  It is a remarkably even-handed work, and bodes well for the future of study of the Great War.	2001-03-21
US	48242885	R2AEHHRLLT4ZOH	0553380478	481076278	Bombay Ice	Books	4	10	12	N	N	A strong, but flawed, first novel	In her debut novel, Leslie Forbes' reach exceeds her grasp.  Fortunately for the reader, in failing to achieve perfection, she has still surpassed the bulk of the new fiction on the market.  &quot;Bombay Ice&quot; is a dizzying, sultry foray into the dark underside of Indian culture.<br />The reader is pushed and pulled through a host of mind-bending circumstances and events as the heroine searches for her sister's murderer.  In gritty detail, the reader is exposed to Bombay, and to a lesser degree, the rest of India through the eyes of someone who both loves and loathes the country.<br />The downside with this novel is that Forbes tries to tackle too much in one book.  &quot;Bombay Ice&quot; is alternately a look at the sociology of modern India, an examination of mental illness, and of course, ultimately, a murder mystery.  All of these elements are executed well, to a point; but there is simply not enough time to flesh them out completely and keep the novel moving along.  Ironically, this mish-mash of angles confuses the plot and ends up having the positive effect of masking the conclusion.<br />Forbes is a writer of prodigous talent, and with a little polishing, she will undoubtably win raves in the future.  In the meantime, &quot;Bombay Ice&quot; is a very strong effort, and a thoroughly enjoyable novel.	2001-03-21

One is an outstanding first-hand account of the campaigns for Peleliu and Okinawa from the perspective of the United States Marines.  The second, which is what makes this book so special, is the tale of the of fear and abject horror that those young Marines had to deal with.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; isn't just about two military campaigns in the Pacific, it's about the emotional &quot;campaign&quot; that each soldier had to fight just to keep going.  With an unflinching pen, Sledge takes the reader on a descent into the maelstrom of lead and blood that was these campaigns.  The reader feels the terror, the cold and heat, the filth, the sorrow...and is also offered a glimpse of the extraordinary courage those young men showed.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is a superb, moving account of men in combat.  It is a must read for anyone who knows the operational history, but not the personal history, of WWII.	2001-03-12

Through 2700 years of history the authors, with varying amounts of detail, and with varying degrees of success, review the great military turning points in history, and their alternate outcomes.  I say with varying degrees of success because the pieces are in no way consistent in approach, layout, or thoroughness.  Of particular note, some of the more well-known historians, like Keegan and Ambrose, present pieces that are so brief, and so lacking in academic rigor, one wonders if they weren't written on the back of a cocktail napkin.<br />That said, there are also some truly outstanding pieces in &quot;What If?&quot;, in particular, a consideration of American Pacific strategy following a defeat at Midway is excellent.  Overall, the essays provide good overviews of particular events, and serve to direct the reader for approaches for more rigorous reading and research.<br />Ultimately, &quot;What If?&quot; is an enjoyable read, and a nice overview of military history.  It cannot, however, be considered a work of serious scholarship.	2001-03-12

And it will.  &quot;The Odd Sea&quot; is by turns sorrowful and uplifting, but ultimately it is just about dealing.  About living one's life in the face of the pain, frequently unexplainable, that comes into every life.<br />As the reader follows Phillip's ongoing, quietly desperate, search for the whereabouts of his lost brother, we see all the characters deal with tragedy in their own way.  Eventually, we see Phillip come to grips with his grief.<br />&quot;The Odd Sea&quot; is a short novel, with simple, yet elegant, prose.  I read it in just a few hours.  However, its moving narrative will stay with me much longer; it is one of the best novels I have read in the last five years.	2001-03-12

Patton is one of the figures of World War II, of the 20th Century, who has transcended &quot;historical figure&quot; and has become a mythological figure.  Whether heaped with praise, or villified, he is almost always treated as larger than life.  In this remarkable biography, Carlo D'Este cuts through all that nonsense and gives us an astonishingly thorough picture of Patton the man.<br />What is revealed, is that Patton was an enormously complex HUMAN BEING.  While irrefutably a military genius, he was also a horribly conflicted person.  Plagued by dyslexia at a time when it lacked scientific recognition, this shy, horribly self-concious man created a personality to mask his true feelings of self doubt.  Perhaps inevitably, this persona eclipsed the man who created it, and left the world with the impression of Patton as a colorful, but unfortunately outrageous and uncouth man.<br />D'Este undoubtably has the utmost respect for Patton, but he is also unflinching in his critiscm when warranted.  His research is extremely thorough, and the narrative is remarkably even-handed for a figure who is frequently portraied as Greek hero.<br />&quot;Patton: A Genius for War&quot; is a biography of the highest caliber, and a must read for an serious student of World War II.	2001-03-11

That's not to say &quot;Tides of War&quot; isn't good, it is.  And that's not to say that Pressfield's signature brand of ancient combat isn't encountered, it is.<br />Where the books differ is that &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; was the history of one specific event.  The novel led to an inexorable conclusion.  Regardless of the paths the characters took on their way there, the ending was never in doubt.  &quot;Tides of War&quot;, on the other hand, is the tale of one man, Alcibiades, and how he shaped ancient Greece, and how he was shaped by it.  In the absence (or even in the presence) of extensive knowledge of ancient Greece, the reader is left to wander through a morass of scandal and ambition.  And, since this is a novel, there is plenty of room for side-plots and embellishments.<br />While &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; was a novel Tom Clancy would write about ancient Greece, &quot;Tides of War&quot; is a novel that John LeCarre would write about ancient Greece.  It is full of intrigue and back-biting, played out across the backdrop of a world in violent upheaval.  In much the same way the LeCarre explored how one man's ego could impact the Cold War, so tpo does Pressfield examine how one man's ambition can be both his, and his country's, fortune, and his, and its, doom.<br />As one might guess, &quot;Tides of War&quot; is not as easy a read as &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;.  However, it is every bit as well written, and in many ways much more deep, and I highly recommend it.	2001-03-09

In a novel of breathtaking power he tells the tale of a battle that literally altered the course of civilization, and the stories of the men who fought it.<br />The most striking thing about this book is how well researched it was.  There is a level of complexity in every character and setting that could not have been achieved without the most rigorous study.  In particular, he goes a long way towards dispelling the myth of the Spartan automaton.  While their society is not one that we would necessarily want to live it, it is remarkably rich and multi-layered, and Pressfield does a superb job of presenting it.  Furthermore, in addition to an eye for historical detail, Pressfield has captured something of the style of the ancient epics.  While by no means on par with the Odyssey or the Iliad, Pressfield's choice of language and pacing echoes these masterworks of western literature<br />Where this novel truly shines, though, is in the battle scenes. The reader can almost smell the blood and sweat, feel the choking dust and crash of bodies and hear the awful screams of the wounded. I have read a lot of military fiction, but I have never been as captivated by anything in the genre, as I was by this novel.  The author is able to accomplish this because he writes characters possessed of great humanity and pathos.  One can feel and fear for them because they are so fully realized.  Pressfield's attention to characterization makes the scenes of carnage and inevitable defeat all the more poignant. <br />Ultimately you can read \\"Gates of Fire\\" on two different levels.  First, you can approach it as a straight adventure story, and you will come away satisfied.  The battles are as fast-paced and as well described as any you will find in writing.  The second level is to consider this novel as a work of literature and history.  I learned a tremendous amount in the reading of this book, and I was already fairly well versed in Greek history.  Also, as I mentioned before, Pressfield's writing and choice of language perfectly captures the period.  In the end, either way you choose to approach this novel, whether you take it at face value, or dig a little, you will certainly not be disappointed.<br />Enjoy!	2001-03-08

Like few other works of history I have an encountered, the author mixes solid historical narrative with a host of first hand anecdotes.<br />Russ creates a vivid, moving portrait of the Marines who so selflessly fought over the frozen ground of the Korean Peninsula.  The reader follows the course of the campaign at a macro level, and then hunkers in the freezing slit trenches of the grunts on the ground.<br />The only thing that prevented the &quot;Breakout&quot; from getting five stars was the glaring lack of maps, particularly ones outling troop dispositions.  Furthermore, the narrative was somewhat choppy due to the frequent interjection of personal accounts; but that's the price you pay for first hand history.<br />Overall, &quot;Breakout&quot; was both a superb historical text, and a moving, group biography of the Marines in Korea.	2001-03-05

I have never been in combat, I've never even been in the military, but after reading &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; I feel I have gained some small appreciation of the astonishing bravery our troops call upon every day.<br />This is not an easy book to read.  Almost from the start, the reader encounters American soldiers fighting for their lives in an immensely hostile city.  Through a host of first hand accounts and thorough research, Bowden throws the reader into this maelstrom of lead and blood.<br />Furthermore, Bowden did not give short shrift to tactics and military reality in the pursuit of personal drama.  In a step by step manner he walks the reader through the battle from start to finish.  He pays great attention to the tactical decisions, both good and bad, that impacted the battle.  At the same time, he considers the strategic environment these decisions were being made in, and evaluates the decision making from President Clinton on down.<br />&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is a superb tale of courage under fire, but more than that, it is an outstanding tactical history of a military engagement that will undoubtably loom large in any decision to commit US troops to foreign soil in the future.  It is a must have for an student of military history and foreign policy.	2001-03-05

The evolutionary science that serves as the premise of the novel is speculative, but not beyond the realm of belief.  Furthermore, it serves to make the book one of the more original I have encountered.<br />However, as I mentioned, the ending is something of a let down.  It is overly rushed, and doesn't really offer anything in the way of resolution.  That said, this is still and enjoyable piece of hard SF.  With a better ending I would have given it five stars, but it is still well worth reading.	2001-02-23

Both groups have their merits, and Brinkley has done a superb job of taking the best elements from each.  The result is a novel that is both a breathtaking naval adventure and a thoughtful exploration of human nature.<br />On the \\"techno-thriller\\" side, Brinkley has an excellent grasp of the operations of a US Navy vessel, but he doesn't beat the reader over the head with his knowledge.  Rather, he weaves the procedures and activities into a suspenseful account of the opening shots of a nuclear war.  He deftly balances the need for detail and realism, with the overarching need to drive the story forward and succeeds admirably.  An interesting side note to this realism is the ignorance in which the survivors live; unlike many end of the world novels, Brinkley recognizes that we live in an age where situations might escalate beyond the ability to distribute information about them.  This ignorance adds another level to the novel, as the survivors are left asking the ultimate question in the shattered world they inherit: \\"Why?\\"<br />On the literary side, Brinkley does a superb job of exploring the human drive for survival.  In the face of an almost completely futile effort (to survive after a global nuclear war), the reader sees mankind at its most human and at its most animalistic.  In both instances, this can be good or bad.  On the good side, we see a small band of survivors using the breadth of human ingenuity and knowledge to achieve the most basic goal of passing on their genes.  On the flip side, we see humans giving full vent to their cunning and viciousness as they place their survival above all else.  <br />Furthermore, Brinkley is an excellent writer.  His characterizations and descriptive writing are superb and he does an excellent job of capturing the spirit of earlier writings about the sea.  In particular, I found myself thinking of Joseph Conrad after reading many of his passages.<br />\\"The Last Ship\\" is an exciting adventure, but it is also a thoughtful consideration of both the futility of the nuclear arms race, and, more importantly, of the remarkable range of response that humans can display when faced with great adversity.  This novel will not only entertain you, but it will also leave you thinking long after you are done reading it.<br />Enjoy!	2001-02-23

At its most fundamental level, it questions what it means to be human.  Is the soul fundamental to life, or is it the product of compassion and experience?  Furthermore, is religion a product of human experience, or is it a guide for human experience?  Dick doesn't claim to know the answers to these questions, but, as is the case in many of his novels, it is the asking that is important.  The fact that such deep thinking occurs in a brilliantly imagined post-apocalyptic city populated by deep, wonderful characters makes this novel all the more remarkable.	2001-02-22

It's enigmatic ending suggests a &quot;many worlds universe&quot; that leads the reader to question the nature of reality.  More fundamentally, though, the reader is left to question, What is an American?  Would I suit my lifestyle to a totalatarian regime with relative ease?  Am I as moral as I think?

What I am sure of is that it operates on two very different levels.  The first is an engaging, well plotted murder mystery.  The novel begins with a scene from the end and then jumps back in time.  This, coupled with the almost 18th century prose, serves to immediately catapult the reader into a confused, uncertain plot.  And that's perfect, because that's how the characters perceive their world.<br />The second level is where things get a little more murky.  I see at least two arguments as to the underlying theme of &quot;Shirker&quot;.  The first is a statement on how our modern society has left us awash in information (and memories) to the point where it is impossible to move forward due to the baggage of the past.  The second speaks to being true to one's self.  More specifically, it refers to holding on to what is truly important, recognizing what is truly important, in a world drowing in irrelevance.<br />Ultimately, this is a novel that will mean different things to different people.  That's what makes it special; not only does it entertain the reader with an intelligent mystery, it also leaves the reader thinking about something bigger.  I know it will stay with me for a long time.	2001-02-21

US	48242885	R224AHQXISFH1G	0151004218	77621968	All the Names	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Amazing, thought provoking novel	Saramago's haunting novel will stay with you long after you have completed it.  Through his protaganist, Senhor Jose, the reader is forced to confront both the nature of a human being's intrinsic worth, and what drives our decision making process.  In regards to the first aspect, the reader comes to realize that the complexity of a person's life is in no way related to its public visibility.  Regarding the second consideration, the reader is left to wonder whether we do in fact have free will, or if we are driven by some higher power.  Or, is it a combination of the two?    These elements drive the novel to its moving, thought provoking conclusion.  This is a small novel that plays host to several big ideas, and it is well worth reading.	2001-02-18

This is not so much a novel, as it is the collected mythology of a place and time that never existed.<br />This work reveals in even greater depth than his other works, Tolkien's inspirations.  Furthermore, his background in linguistics is revealed as the evolution of Middle Earth's denizens gives rise to a host of languages of amazing depth and consistency.<br />This is not the easiest book to read.  But a close reading will offer hundreds of delightful tidbits and will provide an incredibly thorough historical foundation for the events in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.	2001-02-09

Ross is a detailed look at the planning that the United States undertook in the period from the end of World War II to the beginning of the Korean War in order to meet the rising Soviet threat, with a strong emphasis on the word \\"plan\\".  If you are looking for a book on early Cold War politics, or even a look at U.S. grand strategy in the post-war era, this is not what you are looking for.  Ross concerns himself exclusively with the military's contingency planning for open war with the U.S.S.R., and given the hypothetical nature of that planning, and the vastly reduced role in policy formulation the military enjoyed post 1945, these plans are exercises in threat evaluation, and generally speaking, not power politics.<br />Ross' work opens with perhaps one of the great ironies of the Cold War: by 1946 the U.S. military, arguably the most powerful armed force in history at the end of WWII, and certainly the most well rounded, had been gutted to the point that it was not only incapable of defending Western Europe, it was largely incapable of even slowing the U.S.S.R. down.  At the same time, there is the puzzling dichotomy of a military forced to rely on atomic weapons to compensate for a lack of conventional forces, at the same time that they have no idea how many weapons are available, and only a dim view of their battlefield utility.  Thus, the first plans Ross discusses, are defined by a complete withdrawal from Western Europe, and a WWIII fought from the Middle East.  The initial phases of such a conflict would entail an evacuation of continental Western Europe, a reinforcement of Great Britain, and securing the Mediterranean theater of operations.  At the same time, atomic attacks would attempt to pound the U.S.S.R. and its satellites into submission.  In the final phases of this scenario, the Allies would drive into the Soviet Union from the south, through the Caucuses.  This final element is interesting in that it draws far more on the maneuver theory so prevalent today, than do the latter iterations of the plan, which presage the defense in depth of later decades.<br />It would excessive to give an overview of each additional scenario, but there are a few developments in the following years that often define the remainder of the Cold War era.  The first is that the arms race is defined at a very early date; aside from the use of atomic weapons, Ross repeatedly mentions contingency planning for the development, and presumable use, of chemical and biological weapons.  Along those same lines, the direction of nuclear war was pretty much set by 1948, as the first target of atomic bombs became the enemy's atomic bombs.  Thus, in the span of three years, atomic bombs went from being a decisive weapon, to a non-factor (although it wasn't recognized yet) as all battlefield utility (e.g. counterforce) had largely been removed from their employment.  This likewise dovetails into the internecine strife that often characterized the service branch turf wars of the Cold War.  In particular, the Air Force/Navy battles become apparent as the Air Force argues that atomic war is the primary task in any future war, rather than one of many.  In addition, although it is never explicit, the refusal to mount a first strike becomes implicit in U.S. military planning at this point.  Finally, Ross' discussion of the fears for terrorism and subversion in the U.S., including the use of unconventional weapons by Soviet agents strongly echoes the fears of a post 9/11 world.<br />Ultimately, the need to shore up European allies in the newly formed NATO brings planning full circle, as the Joint Chiefs are forced by political requirements to plan for the defense of Europe.  This, when combined with the Korean War, finally begins the process of funding that will allow the U.S. to have at least a reasonable chance of defending Europe.  Thus, in five years another full circle is achieved as the military is gutted to achieve a political expedient, only to be rebuilt in order to achieve a different one.<br />In the end, Ross has done an excellent job of compiling numerous primary sources into a through, cogent and readable volume.  His considerations of budget constraints versus planning necessities serve as a constant grounding for the work, and his exploration of the challenges of atomic planning is both interesting in and of itself, and critical to understanding the development of America strategy.  This is a must read for any student of the Cold War.<br />Jake Mohlman	2001-01-26

There is no debating the quality of the writing in this book.  From the rousing introduction, to the various essays, and the clever conclusion, the authors do a superb job of engaging the reader in their various areas of expertise.  That said, the work overall is somewhat uneven.<br />I believe this stems from the fact that the various historians don't all share the same comfort level with projecting the consequences of their counterfactuals.  Some barely scratch the surface of what might have been, while others go into extensive detail (in particular, &quot;What if Hitler had Invaded England&quot;, my favorite).  However, this complaint speaks more to the flow of the work overall, and not to the quality of each essay.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Virtual History&quot; is an outstanding work, that shows top notch research and excellent writing.  My one caveat to the potential reader would be that this is not a particularly light, easy reading book.  If you are looking for a somewhat less rigorous, less scholarly look at counterfactual history I would recommend &quot;What If?&quot; (Cowley ed.).	2001-01-23
US	48242885	RDZEN3K6NY733	0440224675	313045692	Hannibal	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A literary thriller	Perhaps what I enjoy most about Harris' books is his elegant use of language.  His choice of words paints a lush, beautifully realized landscape.  And it is this use of language that makes Hannibal Lecter such an appalling monster.  He doesn't fit any of our presuppositions of what an evil person should be: he's educated, polite, cultured and refined.  The reader is constanlty challenged because in the face of overwhelming evil, a small corner of the mind is always hoping he will escape justice.<br />Ultimately, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a look at the dark side of human nature.  While no sane person would ever commit the acts Hannibal does, his motives aren't mysterious.  It's not impossible to imagine a person you know succumbing to the predator buried in their genetic make-up.<br />This is not an easy book to read.  Aside from the gore, parts of it are profoundly disturbing.  But it is a smart, haunting thriller, and anyone who approaches it with an open mind will surely enjoy it.	2001-01-23

This review, however, refers specifically to the version illustrated by Alan Lee.  His paintings are masterful and capture the true essence of Tolkien's imagination.  Furthermore, the book itself is printed on outstanding glossy paper, and the binding has proved remarkably durable.<br />Whether you are reading this novel for the first time, or the fiftieth, this is the version you want.  While it is a bit pricey, it truly captures the romance of the novel in a way no other edition could possibly equal.	2001-01-20

What it is not, as some might surmise from the title, is a &quot;what if&quot; text that reviews the alternative outcomes of the decisions not made.<br />The author does an excellent job of reviewing the various opinions offered Hitler by his various military advisors, and he does an excellent job of outlining their merits.  Furthermore, at every turn he makes a compelling case for what he considers to have been the proper course of action.  Unfortunately, Alexander frequently bogs down in narrative of the various battles, and loses his focus on the critical decisions not made.  Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, he generally does not project these alternate decisions into a long term view of the war.<br />This is an enjoyable little book, that offers an excellent overview of some of the critical German military decisions of WWII.  However, anyone looking for a more serious work would do well to consider Murray &amp; Millett's outstanding &quot;A War to Be Won&quot;.	2001-01-20

I could almost feel the oppressive heat, almost hear the bullets whip-cracking over head.  This is a book that is brutal in its truth, but that read like a novel.

This is a superbly written, well thought out book.  Leonhard offers, step by step, the history of &quot;maneuver&quot; warfare, and explains how it has been ill applied in American arms.  He goes on to provide a doctrine for it's application, and finally critiques the Army's performance in Panama and the  Persian Gulf.<br />Leonhard's tactical sense is above reproach, and his explanations are offered in cogent, brief passages.  This work is unique in my experience with military theory in that it is both easy to read, and important.

And I suppose it would be wrong to say it's not.<br />More accurately though, it is an indictment of people who use technology as a crutch to navigate the travails of everyday life, at the expense of interpersonal relationships.  It is an indictment of people who believed that have only one course of action, when the fact is, they are too blind to see the other paths they might take.<br />This is an amazing, moving novel, that offers great insight into our collective (flawed) state of mind at the dawn of the 21st century.	2001-01-20

Frank makes superb use of a host of documents declassified over the last decades, to build an intelligent, water tight argument on the necessity of using the atomic bomb on Japan to bring an end to WWII in the Pacific.  Frank intersperses gripping documentary of the finals days in the Pacific with appalling battlefield statistics and definitive diplomatic documents to present a comprehensive explanation, and justification, for the use of the bombs.  He outlines at great length the plans for the invasion of Japan,  and shows why, while they probably would have ultimately succeeded, the cost would have been outrageously high.  Finally, he offers wonderful insight into the Japanese (and American and Russian) motivations, and the logic behind their actions and potential actions.<br />This is a work of tremendous importance that should squash once and for all one of the great claims of revisionist history.	2001-01-20

Using quantities like &quot;velocity&quot;, &quot;momentum&quot; and &quot;mass&quot;, he distills modern warfare to its most basic components, and by so doing, offers the foundation for the proper application of maneuver doctrine in 21st century arms.<br />While perhaps not as engaging as &quot;The Art of Maneuver&quot;, &quot;The Principles of War for the Information Age&quot; is another significant contribution to military theory by an outstanding author.	2001-01-20

Haldeman  changes the point of view among a dozen characters without ever skipping a beat.  Furthermore, he does so without shorting the development of any one character; they are all well drawn, in part because we see them through the eyes of so many other people.<br />That said, this novel gets off to a great start, and really does well until the last twenty pages or so.  At that point, much like Haldeman's &quot;Forever Free&quot;, it begins to feel rushed.  The book ends on a note that is more confusing than anything else.  You really lose the feel for the character's motivations, and there is a lot of activity that is barely explained.<br />All in all, this is an enjoyable, well written novel, that is somewhat let down by its ending.	2001-01-20

It has element of alternate history and science/fiction fantasy, but is equally a mystery in the tradition of Arthur Conan Doyle.  Moreover, the writing is undeniably similar to Dickens, and his contemporaries.<br />If I had to pick, I would have to classify this book as a mystery, because the other elements are mostly window dressing for a story that could occur in a multitude of settings.  That's not to say the other elements aren't impressive; they most certainly are.  The novel takes place in what is apparently a remote corner of Europe after some sort of extraterrestrial impact devastated most of the planet.  Furthermore, either Ice Age mammals never died out, or they are enjoying a renaissance as a result of the cataclysm.  This unusual, creative scenario help create a real sense of desperation and isolation among the characters.  Although there lives are relatively comfortable, they have been marginalized and pushed to the brink, so anything out of the ordinary is an even greater cause for concern.<br />As for the story itself, it's hard to comment without giving away details.  Suffice it to say that it touches upon the supernatural, but not in the ways one might expect.  Regarding some of the complaints I've seen about the book being anticlimactic, I think it is necessary to consider Barlough's style when leveling criticism.  He seems to be a writer for whom the journey is as important as the conclusion.  I happen to like this style of storytelling, but if you need non-stop action, this may not be the book for you.<br />All in all, I found \\"Dark Sleeper\\" to be an original, witty novel with a remarkably unique narrative style.  Enjoy!	2001-01-12

Through superb use of primary sources, Friedman provides an excellent narrative of fifty years of remarkably complex history.  Yes, there are gaps, but that is to be expected only ten years on.  Overall, the work is very thorough.<br />In particular, Friedman does a superb job of removing some of the mythology associated with the Cold War.  For example, we come to recognize that Eisenhower, behind his benign facade, was an iron-willed president who kept tight reins on the military and foreign policy.  In addition, the most cherished of baby-boomer myths, JFK's presidency, is revealed for the farce it really was.  And finally, we see the real Gorbachev: a pragmatic technocrat whose hands were tied.<br />All in all this is an excellent work of history.  I would have given it five stars, but the editing is truly appalling, I've never seen so many typos in a major hardcover release.	2001-01-12

Where Preston and Child have separated themselves from the pack is in their writing and characterizations.  Any writer can string together high tech jargon and cool gadgets and produce a story.  However, it takes writers of rare talent to combine that science with tight plotting, characters with real depth and beautifully written settings.<br />In \\"Thunderhead\\" the reader follows an expedition in pursuit of Quivera, the lost city of gold.  Of course, nothing is ever easy, and there are mysterious forces at work trying to block the expedition.  While that may sound somewhat hokey, I can assure you that the authors have done their research well.  They bring a tremendous amount of historical fact, as well as cutting edge speculation into their story.  In fact, I was so intrigued by the history they injected into the story, I went out and bought several books on the ancient cultures of the American Southwest.<br />In the end, \\"Thunderhead\\" is a great read; it has enough of a foundation in reality that you don't find yourself grimacing at the clichés of a typical thriller.  At the same time, the writing is superb, and the reader is inevitably sucked in as the authors ratchet up the tension to the point where one literally can't put the book down.  Once again, these authors have proven that a book doesn't have to be mindless to be entertaining.<br />Enjoy!	2001-01-11

Preston and Child lead you throught a maze of pertsonalities, cross-purpose and deceit without ever missing a beat.  There is no true &quot;bad guy&quot; in this novel, bu there are many people who fall victim to some of the less savory aspects of human nature.  That's really what makes &quot;Riptide&quot; so enjoyable, it has an end, but it's not as neat and tidy as many might hope.<br />As in many of Preston/Child's books, the nemisis isn't a who, but a what.  In this case it's the most diabolical treasure trove since Oak Island, which contains an artifact with a sinister, irresistable allure.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely, it's only downside is that you can't read it on a week night because you'll never sleep.	2001-01-11

Unfortunately, it came up somewhat short.  That's not to say it's a bad book; but it isn't as intellectually stimulating, or as entertaining as its predecessors.<br />As usual, the writing is elegant, and generally superb.  The story is well plotted, and moves along at a reasonable pace.  However, when all was said and done, I didn't really feel like I had gone anywhere by reading this book.  The story was entertaining, but there was no real climax, and hence no real resolution.<br />Perhaps that is what Macleod was striving for; a vehicle to develop characters for future works.  If that is the case, he succeeded admirably.

US	48242885	R35KMYAYH201WQ	0446525871	156360117	The Ice Limit	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great start, OK finish	Lots of authors write great popular fiction, but what really sets Preston and Child apart is the meticulous research they bring to their books.  Ice Limit does not disappoint in this regard.<br />The authors introduce a host of technical information without bogging down the plot.  The detail is serious, but not overwhelming.  In particular, their description of an elite engineering firm and its projects and methods is outstanding.  In fact, I would go so far to say that this is their best researched, most tightly plotted book.<br />Ice limit gets of to a great start and doesn't let up until the end.  That said, the end seems a little hurried, almost tacked on.  It's not bad, but it's so different from the rest of the novel it seems out of place.<br />Ultimately, though, that's a small complaint about an otherwise great novel.	2001-01-11

From the beginning the reader plunges into Loyd's personal hell of unrealized ambition, a dysfunctional family, and an addiction to, alternately, danger and drugs.  Alternating between England and the shattered regions of the former Yugoslovia and Chechnya, we come face to face with a young man whose psyche mirrors the shattered landscapes he explores.<br />What makes this book truly important, however, is that Loyd brings no sense of self-pity, no guilt to his narrative.  This is not to say he is amoral, but he doesn't use the horrors he has experienced as an excuse.  A reason, yes, but never an excuse.<br />This work operates on so many levels I could never do it justice in the brief space allocated here.  Suffice it to say this is a haunting, moving, powerful book.  It is not an easy book to read, but it is well worth the effort.	2001-01-11

Macgregor systematically presents the history of American combineds arms, tears apart the current structure, and rebuilds it into lethal, 21st century fighting force.<br />Unlike many professional military men who take up the pen, Macgregor is an excellent writer, who justifies ever proposal he makes, but avoids bogging down the work in mountains of detail.<br />I do not agree wholesale with all of Macgregor's points, particularly in regards to naval expeditionary forces, but the overall rigor of the book more than compensates for that fact.  Macgregor has clearly grasped the premise that elite institutions (such as the American military) can only improve through the most rigorous process of self criticism and innovation.<br />&quot;Breaking the Phalanx&quot; is an innovative, outstanding work, and if there is any justice the Army will give him a medal for his brilliant contribution to American arms.	2001-01-11
US	48242885	R4EJ3KALSP9TV	0679735259	135528120	Dispatches	Books	5	5	5	N	N	About as real as it gets	I was born in 1974, and my impressions of the Vietnam War have generally been shaped by the politcal, emotional baggage left in its wake.  People talk about what Vietnam meant, what it was about, why it was right, why it was wrong, but rarely about what it was.  This book does just that.<br />With prose that comes at you like it's being fired out of a machine gun, Herr describes the action on the ground as it was: terrifying, brutal, and appalling.  But he also writes about the tenderness, brotherhood and compassion that war bred between men who would have otherwise never met.<br />This is a powerful, important book that anyone who wants to understand Vietnam as an experience should read.	2001-01-11

I say unfortunately because this sets a stage that will make the beginning of &quot;The Cassini Division&quot; much easier to understand.  So make sure to read &quot;The Stone Canal&quot; first.<br />That said, by no means skip this book if you haven't read it already.  It is in many ways more entertaining than &quot;The Cassini Division&quot;, although I found it packed less of a punch intellectualy.  Even so, this is a smart book, written by a very smart author.  It looks at society in a way that no other SF I am aware of does.  As I said about its companion &quot;The Stone Canal&quot; is more of a political/moral tale hidden in SF clothing.  It is a truly original, outstanding work that stands both on its own merits, and as a prequel to &quot;The Cassini Division&quot;.	2001-01-11

This, in spite of the fact that it resulted in hundreds of thousands of casulties, in spite of the fact the Finns performed some of the most brilliant feats of arms in modern history, and, in spite of the fact that the Western Allies sacrficed the Finns on the alter of political &quot;necessity&quot;.<br />The courageous, remarkable defense of their homeland by the Finns in the face of insurmountable odds is no less inspiring or intriguing for its ultimate futility.  With an even hand, Trotter guides the reader through the ferocious Finnish winter, and takes us into the minds of both Russian and Finnish soldiers as they fight in some of the most appalling battlefield conditions ever.<br />In conclusion, my sysmpathy for the Finns is obvious, as is Trotter's, but don't doubt that this is a serious work of history.  Trotter deals judiciously with all parties to the conflict based on fact; popular mythology plays no role in this work.	2001-01-11

WWII was more than just battles, it turned the global politcal/economic system on it's ear; it sparked drives for independence in dozens of countries while ripping empires apart; and it redefined the culture of practically every nation involved.  As I have stated, when an author tries to tackle all these topics, they inevitably give many short shrift.<br />The beauty of this work is that Murray and Millet focus solely on the military aspect of the war.  In so doing they shed much needed light on some of the pivotal moments of the war, and the people involved.  They have an obvious mastery of modern tactics, but the reader is never buried in an onslaught of military jargon.  Furthermore, popular mythology surrounding the various personalities making the critical decisions of the war never colors their commentary.  They go out of their way to judge each person on their merits, and their contribution to the war effort.<br />They also do an excellent job of outlining the logistical battle waged by the allies.  As a result of WWII, logistics is frequently referred to as an American military artform, and the authors do a superb job of explaining why that is the case.<br />If you are looking for a broad history of WWII this isn't your book.  But if you are a serious student of military history who wants to understand the strategy, tactics and personalities that determined the outcome of WWII, &quot;A War to Be Won&quot; is truly outstanding.	2001-01-11

This novel is by no means bad, but after having read &quot;Relic&quot;, and therefore knowing what Preston and Child are capable of, I feel it could have been better.<br />The characters are drawn in rather broad strokes, and I never felt particularly drawn to any of them.  Furthermore, the story, while intriguing, is not exactly edge of your seat stuff.<br />That said, the writing is excellent.  In particular, Preston and Child exhibit excellent descriptive writing ability, and a knack for setting the mood.<br />All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I wouldn't make it the first Preston/Child novel you read.	2001-01-11
US	48242885	R2LOZFQFAOKNK0	0399144986	536544726	Resurrection Day	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Best Alternate History since &quot;Fatherland&quot;	I really can't say enough good things about this book.  It takes as it's foundation an immensely believable historical event (the Cuban Missile Crisis goes bad) and runs with it.<br />Two things that really jump out about this book are it's accuracy and how well the story keeps moving.  In regards to the first point, most people don't realize how badly outgunned the Soviets were in 1962, but Dubois' firm grasp of history assures that the shakedown in the balance of power reflects accurately the military-political realities of the time.  As for the second point, many alternate histories spend a great deal of time talking about whatever event makes it an alternate history.  Not so in &quot;Ressurection Day&quot;; any alternate information the reader needs to know is smoothly unveiled in the context of the plot, which keeps the book moving along at a great clip.<br />Finally, this book, while immensely entertaining, is also historically rigorous enough to prove the merit of counterfactuals as a valid means of examining history.  I can only hope that Dubois will continue to write alternate history with the same mastery he displayed in this book.	2001-01-10
US	48242885	RR0WLNB3OLL3O	0375703764	383727435	House of Leaves	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Astounding!	\\"House of Leaves\\" is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best novel I have read in the last five years.  It intertwines so many elements, so masterfully, it's hard to know where to begin describing it.  I guess the first comment I make should be: if you like your literature squarely in the mainstream, this is not a book for you.  However, if you're open-minded this novel will not disappoint you.<br />At it's heart, \\"House of Leaves\\" is the journal of a man who is piecing together a manuscript about a movie about a house that is getting bigger on the inside without any external change.  Sound confusing?  It is; but that's what draws you in.  There are so many plot threads (many of them told through footnotes), and so many narrative voices that the reader is constantly being buffeted by \\"perception\\" vs. \\"reality\\".  Within the context of the book you're never really sure what is going on, and you're therefore forced to think about what the novel as a whole, and its component parts, means.  Furthermore, since the novel is supposed to represent an assemblage of manuscripts, there are frequently gaps in the available information, or it is only partially complete.  As a result, I don't think any two people will ever have the same reading of this book, as your imagination is left free to fill in critical gaps, or leave them empty.<br />In terms of categorization, \\"House of Leaves\\" defies it.  I imagine most people would categorize it simply as Literature.  However, it is undeniably one of the scariest books I have ever read.  I wouldn't paint it with the \\"Horror\\" brush, but the explorations of the house's new rooms are among the most intense passages I have ever read.  On the flip side, there are lines in this novel that had me laughing out loud.  Finally, everything about \\"House of Leaves\\" makes you think.  It is definitely a novel that will stay with you for a long time.<br />In the end, what you take out of this book has a lot to do with what you bring to it.  If you approachit with an open mind, and really take the time to think about what you're reading, I guarantee it will leave an indelible impression.  If you aren't committed to trying something new, however, I'd recommend passing on this book.	2001-01-10

A more accurate description of this book would be as a text book of a hsitory that never was.<br />Sobel starts with the premise that Burgoyne won at Saratoga, thereby leaving our young republic still-born.  He then proceeds to recount 200 years of &quot;history&quot; of the Commonwealth of North America and its rival, the United States of Mexico.  The depth into which he delves is nothing short of astonishing, and the rigor he imposes on the work is equally amazing.<br />As one might guess, I enjoyed this book immensely, but it's not a book I would recommend broadly.  If you are not a reader of serious history, it is pretty much assured that you will not enjoy this book.  It strives for accuracy and reality in a way that is refreshing, but which could easily overwhelm the unprepared, or unmotivated reader.	2001-01-10
US	48242885	R3HL1JPEX7Q5WK	0679463321	565707898	Killing Time	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Disappointing	This was a book that I really wanted to like, which made it all the more upsetting when I didn't.  Caleb Carr is an extremely talented writer, and he makes great use of every word.  His prose is compact, but not overly brief.<br />That said, great writing can't salvage a poorly plotted story.  &quot;Killing Time&quot;, although set in a believable future, requires the reader to make constant leaps of faith about technology and the ability of private citizens to obtain it.  Also, Carr finds no redeeming value in any of the wonderful inventions he creates, which, aside from being depressing, is completely unrealistic.  This view of technology, which has no broad basis in historical fact, tends to drag the book down.<br />Furthermore, the plot is rushed in many places, while dragging in others.  One is never drawn into the flow of this book, which is a shame considering the strong writing and premise this book has as it's foundation.	2001-01-10

As you might guess from the title of this review, a big reason for that is that it defies being placed in a neat little category.<br />Smith is an excellent writer, with a true gift for timing and a mastery of the English language.  He delves deeply into the into reality, and how frequently, we believe what we are told, rather than what detect with our own senses.  In that regard I wouldn't hesitate to call this book literature.<br />On the other hand, the vehicle for Smith's psychological explorations is a mystery, or thriller, and it is undoubtably an entertaining novel.<br />Finally, there are parts of this book that are as disturbing and creepy as anything in Danielewski's &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, which might lead one to consider this book &quot;modern fiction&quot;.<br />Ultimately, Smith grasps elements from all these genres, and weaves them into a masterful tale of suspense and madness.  &quot;Raveling&quot; is a true rarity in that it is both entertaining and profound.	2001-01-10
