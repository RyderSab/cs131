Although Peter Bergna was convicted of murdering his wife, the reader never finds out his true involvement in her death.  Likewise, we're not given a definitive motive.  The entire book is speculation, guess work, and accusation.  Put together, it makes for a very dull book.	2005-09-12

Mary Beth is serving prison time for her crimes; Marie Noe should be doing the same. <br />I also feel that Marie's husband and Mary Beth's are guilty of crime by STUPIDITY.  How could either man witness death after death and not begin to question WHY it keeps happening?

She moved from doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital to avoid being apprehended.  Fortunately her reign of infanticide was uncovered and brought to a screeching halt.  It is unfortunate that Marie Noe's reign of terror was allowed to continue, resulting in the death of 8 innocent babies.

I know The Sound and the Fury is reputed to be Faulkner's greatest achievement.  About the only part of the book that I enjoyed is seeing the various characters develop in strength or weakness.<br />Benjy is my hero.  Why? Because he keeps his mouth shut during the entire book.  I believe he continuously cried and blubbered because he was mortified to be a part of the Compson family as well as the entire saga of The Sound and the Fury.  I feel the strongest characters in this novel are the women, with the exception of Mrs. Compson.  Caddy and Quentin seek liberation from the dysfunctional wrath of Jason as soon as possible.  What courage it took to be freed from the miserable existence within the Compson household.  Dilsey is another example of strength and control.  If anyone is resposible for keeping the family intact, the credit goes to Dilsey.<br />Mrs. Compson, Jason, and Quentin are weak and either cowardly or bullyish.  What awful traits to exemplify their existence.<br />For a writer who died in 1962, Faulkner holds little respect for blacks, women, and jews.  I found his treatment to be offensive and disturbing.<br />I also challenge Faulkner's end to the book.  So many loose ends are not brought to conclusion.  The reader is left wondering what happens to just about everyone.<br />All in all, I feel the book is an overrated piece of poor literature that really needs to be reevaluated for its place in literary history.	2005-06-17

I had hear it was difficult to adjust to his syle of writing; conesquently I avoided him altogether.  After reading, As I Lay Dying, I'm sorry I waited so many years to attepmt to read this gifted writer.<br /><br />As I lay Dying centers around the death of Addie Bundren, the matriacrch of the family.  The time between her death and burial is almost comical in the antics that occur to carry her body to its resting place.  Spun throughout the death and nurial are the stories of her husband, sons, daughter, and significant others in her life.<br /><br />The novel is told in stream of consciousness, in hillbilly language, and short snipits about each character.  Put all the snipits together and an engrossing tale evolves.<br /><br />Faulkner address many soical issues subtly: unwanted pregnacny, abortion, sibling rivalry, extramarital affairs, poverty, spousal abuse, child abuse, mental illness, etc.  Each problem is crucial to the whole story and serve to create an understanding of each character and the personaility that shines forth during and after the death of Addie.<br /><br />I would recoomend this book to anyone who is starting out on a quest to understand Faulkner and his style of writing.  The first 20 pages are difficult because the reader has to try to decipher what is going on and how to read Faulkner.  I would suggest reading, then reading, and questioning what has been read before attacking another section of the text.  Remember, Faulker goes back and forth in time without acknowledging the switch.  That's left for the reader to discover.	2005-06-07

Thw two parent unit, the white picket fence, and three-square meals, are almost obsolete concepts. <br />However, the concept of family and togetherness is still alive and flourishing in America.

As a college teacher, I have used The Secret Life of Bees in two of my literature classes.  I've done so because I feel the book is a masterpiece in character and plot development.  Bees will stand the test of time to become a classic from the 2000's. <br />Like Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird, both books are simple stories with profound impacts.  The characters are memorable, the plots explode with captivating twists and turns.  The reader doesn't want the story to end because it means it's time to say goodbye to new found frineds. <br />This is not the case with The Mermaid Chair.  The book is dull, underdeveloped, ludicrous, and absurd. The plot centers around a daughter who returns to her mother's home on some made up island offthe coast of South Carolina.  The daughter is summoned home because her mother has started hacking off her fingers.  Who knows why; actually, who cares why.   <br />Upon arriving on the island, the daughter suddenly realizes her marriage is a sham and that she has fallen in love with Brother Thomas, a religious monk living in a monastery adjacent to her mother's property.  A passionate affair takes place.  Mother continues to hack off fingers; hubby comes searching for wifey; wifey can't leave her new found love, etc. etc. <br />Throw into the pot a series of idiotic island rituals involving the mermaid chair and the worship of some trumped up saint, and the plot becomes more idiotic the further the reader perseveres through the book. <br />Sue Monk Kidd should have called it quits with The Secret Life of Bees.  She would be considered gifted if she stopped with the publication of Bees.  However, since The Mermaid Chair was published (I don't know how), it leaves me doubting the purchase of any further books by this author.  The book is SOOOO back, I'm almost tempted to write to the publishing company to request my money back. <br />I gave this book one star.  That was a gift.  Unfortunately <br />books cannot be rated below one star.If that was possible, I'd give The Mermaid Chair a negative 5.   <br />I would not recommend this book to anyone, even my worse enemy. <br />	2005-05-19

I didn't find the book a page turner, other than my desire to turns pages so I could finish the book as quickly as possible. PUPPET is a true disappointment!	2005-03-26

They Shoot Horses depicts the suffering and misery of depression era America.  The plot centers around a dance marathon in which a variety of pathetic contestants enter in hopes of taking away the cash prize.   <br />Needless to say, they take nothing away.  The marathon takes away their dignity and self-respect; leaving each contestant exposed by the torment that life has heaped upon each individual. <br />They Shoot Horses is an excellent text for the study of character development. The major and minor characters are all equally important.  No one is superior.  All are equal in the misery of life.  How one handles the misery determines their future. <br />Some will say Horses ends on a tragic note.  I disagree.   Animals are shot to be put out of their misery.  Are we not the higher form of animal existence?  I applaud Gloria's strenghth and Robert's compassion.	2005-02-12

One of the reasons I've found Jackie Collins to be such an enjoyable author is that she creates memorable characters.  Her novels, usually are loaded with characters that you'd like to know and those that you'd like to take down a few pegs. <br />Not so the case with HOLLYWOOD WIVES-THE NEXT GENERATION.  The characters are boring, predictable, shallow, and totally not Jackie Collins. <br />Don't waste your money or your time.   <br />	2004-08-24

Augusten Burroughs should refund my money.  Perhaps I'm still living in Puritanical America, but the graphic descriptions of homosexual acts was unnecessary and served only to shock the reader.  Likewise, the bathroom humor, and continued used of 4 letter obscenities does not perform any literary service.<BR>I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of 21.<BR>It's really not even worthy of review.	2003-08-13

What Harper Lee did for Jem, Scout, Dill, Boo, and Atticus, Kidd has achieved with T.Ray, Lily, Rosaleen, May, June, August, and Zach.<br />The book is a real page turner; keeping the reader anxious to find out what happens next.  It's a tale of love, friendship,<br />growth, spirtiuality, death, happiness, and freedom.  Likewise it's a story about bees.<br />I would strongly recommend this book for everyone.  Reading it, makes me wish I was a high school literature teacher.  This book would be at the top of my list for required reading.  The debates and discussions would be phenominal.	2003-08-06

For anyone who has lived with/through clinical depression or any for of mental illness, The Bell Jar is a must read.  Few authors have been successful at capturing this horrifying illness so poignantly, yet realistically.  The reader is invited to experience the throngs of depression as it takes hold and tortures the individual so intensely, that for many the only way to end the emotional pain is self-destruction.  Although suicide is not the answer, it exists as the one sure way to end the misery of everday existence.<BR>'How tragic that Esther is freed from her demons and Sylvia, herself, was not.  This work is a masterful at exposing depression as an ugly and debilitating illness.	2003-08-04

However, once the characters Katrina, Eddie, and  Angie no longer on the scene, the book dies. Part two have the main  characters running all over the house that was focal in part one.   Upstairs,  downstairs, in the dungeon, the first floor, the balcony, the  third floor, the second floor, the hallway, the stairway, the porch,  etc.etc.  Believe me, you'll need your motion sickness medicine to help you  through this book.	2000-07-17

Once the strong, fearless male enters the picture,  Lucy let's herself become weak and needy. Her strength as an woman and  mother begins to diminish.  Too much of the novel is a love story versus  suspense.	2000-07-14
