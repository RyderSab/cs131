It is because of the open honesty or Fred and Steve.<br />In \\"Every Woman's Desire\\" the main point is men are told to become a Bond Servant to the oneness of your marriage.  When the husband does this his wife will be getting what she needs and theoretically she will respond to the husbands needs.<br />Unfortunately the authors are not familiar with women in the northeast corridor of the USA.  Feminism has ingrained in the minds of most women that she must NEVER be intimate with her husband unless she is in the mood.  Otherwise tough luck.   It is her body!<br />Take heart though, all women will appreciate being honored and loved as this book describes but not all women will reciprocate beyond \\"thanks honey\\".	2003-08-07

His train of thought throughout this book is brilliant.   He is in such pain and asks the right questions at the right times.  He not only questions God the way we all would question Him but he comes back to God as the answer.   <br />I think that everyone who is grieving the loss of someone very special to them NEEDS to read this book.	2003-02-06

This book is full of suggestions and points that most people will probably not want to hear but need to hear.  That is why love must be tough.<br />The examples used in this book cover a wide variety of situations.  Dr. Dobson give the perfect suggestion for each.	2003-01-28

He then goes into why your kid may have sleep problems and then he discusses solutions.<br />He covers nearly every potential sleep issue so I bet your child's problem is covered.	2003-01-28

The expectation game seems to be the biggest roadblock for my marriage.   This book devotes chapters to dispelling several myths like \\"Good sex is when you fill my wish list\\" and \\"My spouse responds the same way I do\\".   After that were very helpful chapters concerning when children arrive and 'affairs we never knew we were having'.<br />The chapters on why she is not interested and why he is not interested cover many many reasons.  I even found a reason for me that is rarely touched by other books of this kind.<br />The last section of the book covers how to fix things.  Unfortunately the book does not cover the solution as well as it covers addressing the problem.<br />Regardless, I highly recommend this book to add to your list of books on this subject.	2002-09-12

This book is full of wisdom from his experience and his faith.<br />What I found most profound was at the end of the book where he writes the answers to a question he posed to his own children: what did we do right and what did we do wrong as parents.<br />Absolutely honest and extremely informative.	2002-08-01

Some say you can't teach an old dog new tricks or it is really difficult to re-wire your brain to use the 'other' foot, but the way this book is written is perfect.  It starts with simple activities that you need to master in order to move on.   I highly recommend it.<br />For my fellow lefty drummers, he doesn't use L and R but he uses B.D.1 and B.D.2 which is refreshing.<br />Thank you Joe!	2002-07-09

I have a commentary Bible which is helpful but this book goes a step further.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about what passages mean.

This book is different although it does reference Adrenaline and Stress several times.  I would suggest reading both books for a more complete view of the issues of Anxiety, Stress, etc.<br />As for this book, I have taken away several suggestions (many are common sense) and am putting them into practice.  What makes this book so good is Arch Hart's descriptions of why certain suggestions will work and how they affect the brain, body.<br />Thank you Arch for another great book.	2002-04-30

Her honest and powerful testimony of how she was used and abused by the pro-abortion feminists is not surprising.

I became very interested and looked forward to it being released. I have been interested lately in improving my diet and generally taking better care of myself.   Upon recieving the book at Christmas I took to reading it.   From the very beginning I could not put it down.  He asks 'why is a relationship guy writing a book on food?'   I had the same question.  He then went on to prove the connection and the cycle that many of us live in where the health of our diet and the health of our realtionships contribute to one another.   I realized that there was a figurative hole in my heart that I was trying to fill with food. He then wrote a chapter that he stated was the most important that he has ever written, which talks about a 7 step process (somewhat similar to the typical 12 step process) to fill the hole with the Lord and not food or any other addiction.  You see, we fill the empty feeling of disfunctional relationships with bad food and the bad foods cause us to physically feel ..., which then hurts relationships. This is the negative cycle.<br />Read this book with an open mind and you will agree that this unique book is his best work.	2002-01-14

I don't believe the author is a Christian from what I've gained from her writing.   If you are not a Christian and looking for a less than religious point of view then this is your book.  It just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.	2001-12-27

I have been very much interested in the concept of birth order affecting who you are.   I am a first born male with a younger sister and my wife is a first born female with a younger brother.  Needless to say we have butted heads. <BR>This book is written by a man whose opinion I greatly respect. He covers not just first borns but babies, middles and only's.  He covers the best and worst marriage combinations.  He also writes about how to parent a first born and how to parent when that first born is dethroned.<BR>This book is chock-full of great info about how birth order affects many aspects of life.  He frequently uses his own children as perfect examples.<BR> <BR>I recommend this book highly.	2001-12-26

Very compelling evidence which includes actual copies of the Watchtower.  I am new to learning how to answer a JW and was looking for more of an introduction to disputing a JW but this book does not advertise that.<br />I recommend this book as part of your learning experience in answering/debating a Jehovah's Witness.	2001-11-12

I enjoyed reading this book and it helped me learn about osteopathy. At times i felt I was reading an info-mercial for osteopathy.

I bought and read this book with great anticipation and excitement.  I cannot do ritalin and frankly prefer to be off any similar medication.   Her desription of vitamins and foods were very educational and helped me understand a lot.  Her writing about the brain and its needs was fascinating.  However, the portion on supplements I found a little out-dated and worrisome.  The best example is the recommendation of FOCUS who are now being taken to court over false claims.  Also it is not mentioned that DHA contributes to reduced blood clotting.<br />Otherwise this book was very informative.  I would recommend but read with discernment.	2001-08-14

Although Mr. Hart is a Christian, it isn't until the last chapter that he writes about Christianity's effect on reducing stress.  This is intentionally and effectively done.  Nonetheless, I found this book incredibly informative with lots of practical advice well explained.  I immediately realized why it took me the first four days of a vacation to settle down and why I tend to have a stress headache on most saturdays.  I have intentionally tried a few of his suggestions and they work.  I recommend this book to anyone, especially those who have been accused of being type A.  I am not type A and I am a Christian.  I found this book very enjoyable.	2001-08-14
