In spite of the tough-looking photo on the cover, I found &quot;Three Collections&quot; full of insightful, vivid, thoughtful poems.  Comprised of sections from three of the authors series of poems, &quot;The Women,&quot; &quot;My Roaring 20's,&quot; and &quot;The Brenda Poems&quot;, this books offers a little something for everyone.  &quot;The Women&quot; details poems written about women from all walks of life; &quot;My Roaring 20's&quot; is a gritty, realistic look at Lewis' second decade, chronicling troubled relationships and growing self-awareness; and &quot;The Brenda Poems&quot; are a collection of dialogues between the writer and the (I think) fictional Brenda.  The author cleverly uses this device to address issues in male/female relationships.  I'm not usually a fan of poetry, but reading this book (recommended by a friend who also writes poetry) made want to dig deeper into the genre.	2002-02-09
US	50913793	R2DQYB75AU8GW4	0684841436	919136449	Child of God: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Go 'Lita, Go 'Lita!	&quot;Child of God&quot; is by far Lolita Files best work of fiction to date.  Spanning generations of the Boten family's trials and tribulations, their stories will snatch you up by the collar, pull you into the story , and plop you down on the sidelines as the action unfolds.  &quot;Child of God&quot; focuses on family love both pure (in the case of Ophelia and Polo) and unpure (Ophelia and Lay are just one incestuous combination), as well as drugs, voodoo, murder and suicide.  <br />This is no &quot;and they all lived happily ever after&quot; story.  Characters die in a multitude of graphic, violent ways - this book is not for the squemish - but the death toll never feels  overdone and the plot twists feel authentic, not just done for the sake of theatrics.  <br />After reading this book, it's safe to say that Lolita Files was just playing with us with her three previous novels.  &quot;Child of God&quot; shows her true talent for spinning a tale, and quite a spinner she is.	2001-09-12

This book had me shaking my head, saying &quot;umph umph umph&quot;, and sharing the goings on with my husband as if Kyle, Jay, Allen and Wil were real people. There are, however, some drawbacks. Although the four brothas in the book have been friends since childhood, at some point I had to ask myself the proverbial question: With friends like these, who needs enemies? They lie to each other, on each other, come to blows, curse each other and constantly fall out. They wreck each others relationships, and then, in a fit of contrition, try to make it all better. In short, they are in each others Kool-Aid 24/7, stirring it up and trying to determine the flavor. And the women don't fare much better. All start out as loving, compassionate mates but turn into fire-breathing bee-yotches who will stoop to the lowest of lows to make their men pay for their sins.<br />I'm giving this book five stars for its fast pace and some of the more creative plot developments, but subtracting two for an overabundance of over-the top dramatic flourishes and plot implausabilities. But don't let that deter you from reading the book. Even though you may find yourself scratching your head and wondering &quot;Why?&quot; at some of the characters actions, you won't be able to resist being drawn into the story. And in spite of the fact that these brothas give each other the blues, in the end they always come through for their &quot;dogs&quot;.	2001-09-01

Michael Datcher's style is so vivid and fluid I thought &quot;Raising Fences&quot; was a story he'd spun from his imagination. Once I realized it was a memoir, I was that much more intrigued by his story.<br />Datcher takes the reader through some of the defining moments in his life. His tale may not be much different than many other men, but he bravely lays himself wide open for his readers in a way that must have been painful but also necessary. His life-long ache for a father, his stuttering speech impediment, his painful spiritual soul-searching (which leads him to join a cult-like religion), and his damaging experience with a dishonest woman are all shared with honesty and grit.<br />Happily, Datcher's story ends on a high note, and by the time you reach the end of this book you'll want to cry tears of joy for him. Read this book. You won't be disappointed. I admire the hell out of Datcher for having the heart to write this book.	2001-08-31

Lynn Harris will come away from reading this book with mixed emotions. Initially, catching up with Yancey and Basil is like getting the 411 on former classmates or kids who grew up down the block from you - like 'em or not, you want to know what's going on in their lives. However, soon some of the plot contrivances and goings-on begin to feel like daytime soap retreads. Yancey and Basil, two characters who were formerly evil and underhanded, separately take turns toward softer, gentler personalities, just in time to make room to for new baddie Bart and the returning diva of evil, Ava.<br />I did find myself turning pages quickly, hoping for Ava's comeuppance and wondering if Basil's secret would be revealed, but ultimately this tale was anti-climactic. As always, E. Lynn moves the story briskly with his snappy dialogue (especially between the &quot;kids&quot;), but &quot;Any Way...&quot; is kind of like fat-free ice cream: somewhat of a treat, but definitely not the real thing.	2001-08-31

I've got a couple of BAP friends and one super BAP-py cousin, but that's it. I can't even claim Butterfly status. So since I'm so far removed from the world of Vineyard summers, cotillions, and Kate Spade (although I do buy MAC Chestnut lipliner religiously and repeatedly remind my children to remember their &quot;home training&quot;), it was hard for me to tell when this book was being tongue-in-cheek and when it was just plain out pretentious. <br />I can't recommend this book, but I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it, either. It has it's funny moments, but I just could not relate. And I don't think any self-respecting &quot;GDI&quot; will relate, either. I do appreciate, however, the fact that there's a book out there that doesn't illustrate all Black folks as middle-class, under-educated, shouting in church on Sundays, homemade baby-naming clowns.	2001-08-31
US	50913793	R2T9GWN08G6ND	0375706429	312828157	Otherwise Engaged: A Novel	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Not for wide-eyed idealists	I LOVED this book!  The sugary cover art had me a little skeptical at first, but I was happily surprised to find something totally opposite of the stereotypical fluffy, sappy story of true love and romance. As a woman who married at 35, I found Eve's perspective very real.  Although I didn't go through the extreme ups and downs during my engagement that Eve did, I indentified strongly with her struggles, from the thought that a sock on the floor could lead to a life of cleaning up after her fiance', to her bad bouts of PMS (or as one of Eve's friends calls it \\"Pardon Me, Sybil\\"). Suzanne Finnamore has written a very funny, very honest story of one woman's engagement, and shows that not everyone glides dewy-eyed and lovestruck through the process.  <br />To be fair, I'm letting Suzanne Finnamore's work stand on its own - and I'm a big fan of BJD.  I LOVED \\"Otherwise Engaged\\" and I agree with the other reviewer who said the perspective in this book clearly illustrates the differences between getting engaged in your mid-twenties and getting engaged in your mid-thirties.  I cannot wait for Ms. Finnamore's next novel.	2001-08-02

Let's do the bad ways first: author Karen Grigsby Bates spends much more time and energy than necessary detailing the expensive restaurants, posh hotels, designers clothes, Ivy League educations and top notch career posts that seem oh-so-necessary for novice detective(and journalist)Alex Powell and her circle of friends and colleagues.  It's certainly not a world one can write about without firsthand knowledge and Ms. Bates seems to be letting the reader know, through her story, that this is her real-life world.  I was reminded of the &quot;Negro Geography&quot; I first learned of in Benilde Little's book &quot;Good Hair&quot;.  <br />Now for the good ways: Ms. Bates has a keen ear for snappy dialogue,which moves the pace of the book along nicely and avoids those sometimes plodding moments in mystery novels when not much is happening.  Through Alex Powell's sluething, the reader gets a clear sense of the victim - a well-known publishing magnate and ladies man - as a person and not just a chalk outline. The author also managed to throw in just enough red herrings to keep me changing my mind from one chapter to another on the indentity of the murderer.  <br />Overall, a good beach read.  It was fun, a little frivolous, and entertaining.	2001-08-02

I'm not usually a fan of mystery/suspense novels, but when I read the back cover of this book I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad that I did! &quot;Shades of Jade&quot; is a well-written, suspenseful story. Marissa is a thirty-something, successful single woman who prides herself on selectively dating only professional, moneyed, married men. Although her best friend tries to get Marissa to see the error of her ways, the real wake call begins when Marissa starts to receive threatening phone calls, letters and...well, you'll have to read it to find out....  <br />If you're a fan of light mystery, you'll more than likely enjoy this book. And even if you aren't, give it a try anyway. I think you'll find Gloria Malette a talented storyteller.	2001-07-18

In &quot;Show and Tell&quot;, Nelson George introduces us to Drew, an upwardly mobile, thirty-something daytime talk show producer.  At the outset, Drew seems happy and satisfied with both his career and his relationship with Millie, a successful Internet entrepeneur.  When Millie's work calls for an extended roadtrip across the country, Drew's personal life takes an unexpected turn when he meets and freaks Bee, a sexy mystery woman.  Almost simulataneously, Drew also finds himself directed to spice up the talk show's segments by focusing on sexual topics in a bid to gain higher ratings.  <br />As Drew's professional and personal lives become satured with all things sexual, havoc ensues: relationships are damaged, careers are jeapordized, and skeletons come rattling out of more than a couple of closets.  Very juicy stuff!<br />I enjoyed the various twists and turns the story took as it unfolded, and the sex scenes were spicy and erotic without being salacious.  Although the ending was a little too pat, this book kept me thoroughly entertained - I read it in one sitting.<br />If you like your fiction a little on the saucy, racy side, read this book.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-06-05

I am an avid fan of memoirs, and &quot;Finding Fish&quot; is the most indescribably sad books I've ever read.  Antwone Fisher's hardscrabble life, so lacking in the simple pleasures and creature comforts such as love and affection, is almost painful to read; as you turn the page you'll find yourself hoping that this will be the paragraph where his life begins to take a turn for the better.  What you get instead is continuous accounts of cruel, heartless treatment which starts from the time Antwone is a toddler and last into his young adulthood.  <br />Fisher recounts his life story with the same emotional detachment that must have been necessary for him to survive his childhood surroundings, but as you get further into the story you realize that he doesn't need to &quot;dress up&quot; is words.  The power of his pain does not need embellishment.  Be prepared to cry as you read this book, but also be prepared to feel joy for and pride in Fisher for struggling through, perserving, and ultimately finding success.  This story will make you take stock of your own life and feel grateful.	2001-02-07

When I saw this book on the stands I was immediately excited at the prospect of four African American male authors combining their talents within the cover of one book.  I snapped up &quot;Got To Be Real&quot; and hummed with anticipation all the way home.<br />In my opinion, the outstanding story here is by Marcus Major.  I got so wrapped up in this love story that I ran to get my copy of &quot;Good Peoples&quot; to see what eventually happened between Kenya and Amir, as Amir also turns up in this novel as the main character's brother.<br />E. Lynn Harris does a fine job with his story, as usual, but I have to say I was not feeling Eric Jerome Dickey or Colin Channer.  EJD's story of was so busy being atmospheric and descriptive that the actual love seemed forced, and I just could not get into Channer's tale no matter how hard I tried.<br />I couldn't give this book any less than 4 stars out of respect to these talented authors.  You may love all four stories, but I'll be you'll come away hungry for Marcus Major's newest book.	2001-02-06

The story continues with first person accounts from all the Price's as they struggle with infidelity, substance abuse, poor health, imprisonment, child molestation, and just plain ole family squabbles.  <br />In &quot;Day Late...&quot;, McMillan has recovered nicely from the stream-of-consciousness style of prose that often bogged down &quot;How Stella Got Her Grove Back&quot;.  She dedicates this newest work to her late mother, two sisters and brother, which can't help but lead the viewer to wonder if this story isn't, as with many of McMillan's works, semi-autobiographical.  Whether it is or isn't, you'll enjoy meeting the Price family and probably won't even mind the requisite happy ending.	2001-02-06

Instead, I have to agree with another reader who said the plot could have been the same had the protagonist had straight hair.  I appreciated that the author dealt with the main character's self-esteem issues that evolved from her short hairstyle, I never felt that the character truly embraced her hair or herself with short hair.  <br />Also, it seemed foolish to me that Venus and her newly minted M.D. ex-boyfriend could not patch their superficial differences.  Keeping them apart seemed like a plot device instead of the way life happens. <br />All in all, Trisha Thomas has a fine writing style and I will look forward to other works from her.  I'm just hoping that the next time she'll pay as much attention to substance as she does style.	2001-02-05

Although it has the familiar African American fiction touchstones - professional female protaganist and her &quot;girls&quot;, some supportive some not, men who talk the romance talk but don't walk the romance walk, women who give themselves emotionally without using common sense - this story will take the reader on an emotional journey sure to keep you thinking long after you close the book.<br />Sandy and Adrian meet, hook-up, fall in love, break up, get back together, break up again, and reuinite once more in this before this book draws to a close.  Driven apart alternately by Adrian's secret and Sandy's distrust, when they reunite they must also deal with Sandy's insecurity over her dark skin, her infatuation with Adrian's &quot;butterscotch&quot; tone, Adrian's aloof family members, and some of Sandy's girl's resenting the time she spends with Adrian.  <br />Without disclosing the particular plot twists, suffice it to say that Butterscotch Blues will certainly give you pause for thought.  Overall it is well written and touching, although I found the pettiness between the girlfriends silly, and sometimes felt that not enough time was spent developing characters/relationships.  I highly recommend this book.  I will be buying other works by this author.<br />WARNING: If you don't want to know the specific plot twists of this novel, don't read much further.  Spoilers are contained in some of the other reviews.	2000-09-20

Her tale follows three thirty-something women: one actress, one producer, and one receptionist/would-be-screenwriter as they deal with work, love, and life. Sprinkled liberally throughout with the trials and tribulations of backstabbing co-workers, dishonest showbiz types, afrocentric power players, fast women and faster men, &quot;Blind Ambitions&quot; is good entertainment. If you're looking for a soul-searching, soul-stirring story, this isn't for you. However, if you like your fiction fast-paced and a little bit campy, this Jackie Collins-esque (in a good way) novel is a treat.	2000-09-15

Betty, a strong,  intelligent career woman, seems to have trouble trusting her heart and  giving herself in a relationship - but why? Drew suffers hearbreak over a  lost love, but the reader is never clear as to whether that love was fully  reciprocated.<br />Betty and Drew both make attempts to find love and  affection in the arms of others while developing an on-line friendship.

However, Rodney, the protagonist,  seemed to be man who has his head on straight - why would such a man be  convinced that his future bride is one of the skeletons in his relationship  closet?  Why wouldn't he seek out a fresh, new love?  And isn't he enough  of an individual in his own mind to decide for himself when he wants to  settle down, not be influenced by his homey's marital status and the  pressures from his mom and sister? Those questions aside, One Woman Short  is a nice, light, summer read.  Although the plot can be somewhat  contrived, it is still an enjoyable story.	2000-06-21

For once, the male character wants to settle down and the female has &quot;commitment issues&quot;. I read a great deal of African American fiction and sometimes grow weary of the same old formula:professional career woman and her sassy sidekick look for love;  career woman finds what she thinks is a good man, but can he REALLY be  trusted?; sassy sidekick playa-hates because she's feeling left out; after  a few bumps and snags, true love previals. <br />I found &quot;Good  Peoples&quot; to be a pleasant change of pace, even if that change really  only meant that the typical male/female roles were reversed. Although the  lead male character was at times almost too good to be true in catering to  his woman's every need, I found the dialogue between the two characters  extremely realistic.  I particularly enjoyed the playful banter between the  two.  I will anxiously await Marcus Major's next book!	2000-04-07

She did  not once take responsibility for her choices, and talks over and over again  about the fall out from her lack of judgement without ever examining WHY  she lacks judgement or HOW she can make better choices.

I'm also not sure what the  author was trying to say about Africans, as it seemed that her message in  the beginning of the book was that we should embrace them, then the end of  the book seemed to say &quot;watch out!&quot;.  &quot;The Soul Brother s  and Sister Lou&quot; a young adult book written by Lattany years ago, was  one of my favorites as a young girl and I'm happy to see her writing again.

The first Omar Tyree book I read was &quot;Flyy Girl&quot; and I hated it!  But I gave him a try again  with &quot;Do Right Man&quot; and &quot;Single Mom&quot; and thought both  books were okay.  But I am so sorry I spent my hard-earned money on this  story.  I love and treasure books, but this one is so bad I'm considering  the unthinkable: throwing it away!   I hate to dis a brotha, but Omar,  you've got to come harder than this, baby!	2000-03-21

I enjoyed this book so much and found myself wanting happiness for Sugar as if she were a long-time friend.  This book was as satisfying as a nap after Thanksgiving dinner.  I hope to hear  more from the author, and soon.	2000-03-21
