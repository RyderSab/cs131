It is not as easy reading as Das' book, for example, but it goes much deeper into the subject, and is much more complete.    The book offers a global overview of this vast subject, and a unified picture of the various techniques used, which is necessary given how vast and diversified the subject is.      The fact that each chapter is basically self contained, makes the book very suitable for browsing. It is very well, and at times almost poetically written. I highly recommend it to every serious student of the subject.	2005-08-06

Buy this book if only to have it on your bookshelf. After a long day of suffering fools and putting up with the latest insanities of your university administrators, leaf through Lax's book to recover. This is mathematics at its best. What better use can we put mathematics to, than to help us regain our sanity in a world that's gone mad.	2004-02-20

I think this is a very good introduction to certain aspects of string theory with an emphasis on D-branes. There is no way that any single textbook can cover the entire theory, starting from the oscillator formalism, and all the way to the most recent developments. The subject is simply too enormous for that. <br />This book is a highly commendable effort by the author. We need more such books.	2004-02-11

It is not difficult to read. The style is very informal and at times actually humourous. It does not follow the definition-lemma-proof way of doing things at the expense of leaving simple definitions out, but these can be easily found somewhere else. The book contains an enormous amount of information, and the authors are clearly men of great knowledge and depth. The book is very nicely produced (from a 1st edition) by Cambridge U Press. Very clearly printed, and at a low price for the volume. I highly recommend both volumes to anyone who works in stochastic processes, or mathematical finance (assuming one wants to learn things, rather than just talk about them).	2003-01-01

Shame on CUP for reprinting it in less than perfectly top quality. I guess they know that people will always buy it. It is a book that starts from the very basics of real and complex analysis, and moves on to the very depths of classical special functions. It's a joy to read and to teach from.

Very suitable for mathematical physicists and applied mathematicians. Very lucidly written. I found it quite easy to gather information from it, though probably one will never really appreciate all the subtleties of the pde approach on first reading. <br />On a slightly different matter, one often reads hints to the effect that the martingale approach is more powerful than the pde approach. It would be great if anyone could tell us, using concrete examples why exactly that is the case. Do we really need all of the measure theory celebrated in martingale-based textbooks in order to valuate anything? If yes, then how come that none of that shows up in the pde approach?	2001-08-21

The author is an applied mathematician, of the fluid mechanics variety, and this should tell you right away what the drift of the presentation is like. <br />Some will argue that all of Wilmott's books are along exactly the same line, so why do we need another pde book? Given the amazing number of textbooks dedicated to the martingale approach, it is great to have yet another, fresh way of looking at the pde approach. <br />The derivations come with all the necessary technical details, the style is very down to earth, and to my mind original. There are many details that I personally haven't seen in any other textbook before, and there are plenty of what seem like very useful exercises. <br />I really like this book, and it was a pleasant surprise to see it in a local library.	2001-08-20

But for those with a basic working knowledge of Black Scholes option pricing theory, or even an acquaintance with the basic concepts of replication and hedging, I believe that it could serve as an excellent way to get the reader as smoothly but as fast as possible to the more advanced aspects of derivatives theory, such interest rate theory. Even HJM and BGM are there, near the end.<br />I must say, though, that the book starts with &quot;the parable of the bookmaker&quot; that always put me off, because I found the point that the authors wish to make quite unclear. Now that I understand it, I'm not even so sure that it's really a good analogy of the use of the martingale measure vs the &quot;objective&quot; measure. Also, expressions such as &quot;shortening the odds&quot; are obscure to those of us who don't bet on horses, and it was never clear to me whether &quot;shortening the odds&quot; was analogous to anything in financial mathematics and thereby part of the discussion and the point that the authors wish to make -- I guess it's not. All in all, that was a far lessr than ideal way to start the book. However, once you get over that hurdle, the book is indeed very well written, though very concise.	2001-08-04

Bob Litzenberger is head of Risk Management at Goldman Sachs, and was head of the team that was put in charge of liquidating LTCM's highly illiquid positions, after it collapsed, which must have been a very delicate task that had to be carried out in an orderly way -- something similar to clearing up a mine field (cf Dunbar's book again, and Risk magazine, page 112, August 1999). The way their careers have diverged since they co-authored their book is something to think about.	2001-06-18

The development is slow, but one can argue that that is necessary for the lay reader. By the second half of the book, it becomes clear that the author is fast running out of material. His trouble may be that he had no access to many of the people that he talks about. At this point, the book becomes very thin on facts and very thick on fill in paragraphs. One gets a strong impression that the author's contract with the publisher contains a clause related to the number of pages to be delivered. To compensate for lack of depth, the author adds judgement. On the positive end of the spectrum is Fischer Black. That is fully expected. Black was a quiet brilliant man, who was very much admired by every one who knew him. On the negative end is John Meriwether. JWM is strongly projected not only as delusional, but also as a shallow manipulator. He looks politely over the shoulders of the risk managers seconded by the bail out consortium, and marvels at how they expertly liquidate his arbitrage positions. I just doubt if any of this is true. I suspect that JWM offended the author one way or another. Probably by granting Michael Lewis an interview, but not the author. Well, the point about Mike Lewis is that he can write. Given the fact that the author is an ex-scientist, I expected a bit more objectivity.	2001-03-06

But what is really refreshing about the book is its style: Informal and full of side remarks and jokes that are actually funny. Look up the three bonus observations on page 291.

I think he succeeds. <br />The exposition may not be as rigourous as many people expect it to be, but that's the whole point of the exercise: to give the reader an introductory and motivated first exposure to risk neutral measures, martingales, stochastic differentiation and integration, Ito's lemma, PDE's, stochastic PDE's, equivalent martingale measures, Girsanov's theorem, and a lot more. <br />This is definitely the very first book that a non-mathematician student of the subject should read. No doubt about that. I guess the burning question now is: Which book makes a natural second read? Baxter and Rennie? Bjork? Bingham and Kiesel? I think it should be one of these three.	2000-12-17

It is quite mathematical, but self contained, clearly and carefully written. The appendices are very well written condensed reviews of basic technical facts. The book also contains discussions of a topics that I've never seen anywhere else, such as &quot;Arbitrage and Admissibility&quot; and &quot;The doubling strategy&quot;. As mentioned in the preface, the book is based on a doctoral-level course, and the author clearly had the benefit of a large amount of feedback from students. Reading it, one can't help notice the presence of a very large number of extra remarks and hints, inserted on every page in order to clarify what must have been a denser original text. Finally, I have to mention the excellent editorial work done by Oxford University Press in producing this book, as compared to similar books published by Wiley.	2000-11-25

It definitely contains a large amount of information. Shaw definitely knows how to code in Mathematica, though other reviewers -- who know Mathematica more than I do -- noted that his code is C-like and far from optimal. He also definitely knows a lot about financial derivatives. My problems with the book are that it is far from pedagogical, and more than once I look closely at the details of a proof or an argument, only to find that certain crucial information is missing. For example, his discussion of stochastic calculus is far from complete or introductory -- you cannot learn the subject from that discussion, though the author seems to assume that you can. So this definitely not a textbook. I also believe that I have located strange mistakes. For example, in his MonteCarlo simulation, does Shaw use the normal rather than the log-normal distributions? I found it hard to believe my eyes, but running his code actually gave negative stock prices when the volatility was chosen to be large enough. The author never comments on such details. Finally, the book is too expensive, given that it was produced in whole as a Mathematica notebook.	2000-10-17

It requires almost no technical prerequisites, starts from  scratch, and proceeds in a very clear and orderly manner towards some of  the more elaborate aspects of the subject. If you (plan to) work on this  subject, buy it.<br />The book was written in 1976, and as such does not cover  the more recent developments, though the bibliography has been updated (to  a limited degree) for the current 1998 paperback edition. However, after  all these years, it remains *the* introduction to the subject (with the  possible exception of chapter 14 on computational methods, which is  definitely outdated), and can be supplemented only by Gaspar and Rahman's  'Basic Hypergeometric Series'. I taught a higher undergraduate level course  based on chapters 1, 2, 3, 7 and 9, and my students definitely found these  chapters to be highly readable. <br />My one and only complaint is to  Cambridge University Press: Dover has shown that paperbacks can be produced  in such a way that they can be opened completely flat without being  damaged, and quite cheaply too.
