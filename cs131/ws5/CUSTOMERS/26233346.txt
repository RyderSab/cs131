Rich in imagery, Dali reveals the canvas of his life with candour, colour and masterful composition. Shadows of self-doubt are subtly juxtaposed beside his brilliant self-awareness, and his reflections are a fusion of form and feeling. Many of the entries are poignant, highlighting the painter's melancholic marriage to mortality towards the end of his life. In his final days, he sought neither separation nor divorce from it, accepting the inevitability that the brush strokes of his being would flourish for only a brief period more. Perhaps the most significant entry revealing Dali's resignation is that appearing on page 136:<br />`Cordoba - June19 1986<br />Had lunch today in a fish caf&eacute; on the Plaza del Potro. Table for one. Told the waiter that I had a young man's vision clouded by an old man's eyes. He told me to get glasses. I told him to get stuffed olives. The fish tasted like horse. I was disappointed because it usually tasted like camel. When the bill arrived, I realised I had no money so in lieu of cash I presented a napkin sketch entitled `Apparition of Ungarnished Paella Being Mocked by Pablo Casals on Beach'. The waiter gave me an inferior Picasso self-portrait on drink coaster in lieu of the change.<br />I no longer feel at home with human beings so I think I'll move to New York.'<br />This remarkable book is a work of genius about a genius' work	2004-07-19

Books	5	2	2	N	N	No Noose is Good Noose	`Braxfield: The Hanging Judge?: The Life and Times of Lord Justice-Clerk Robert McQueen of Braxfield' is an insightful biography of a controversial jurist. Brian D. Osborne presents the reader with cruelty personified, even allowing for the less humane times in which McQueen dispensed his callous justice. It is as much a socio-historic treatise as it is a polemic against capital punishment. To add weight to his argument, Osborne compares the brutality of Braxfield to the brutishness of a more contemporary judge, Sir Bayshus Cyst, of the High Court of South Africa. Cyst presided over the court from 1954 till 1962, and his merciless mindset is clearly seen in the passage cited on pages 121 to 125;<br />`Sir Bayshus Cyst, almost asleep at times, was hearing a case brought against a hairdresser charged with administering a colour rinse to a client without uttering a single word. The client was suing for damages, claiming professional negligence against the hairdresser because idle chatter should have been included in the price. Needless to say, the hairdresser was found guilty, and Sir Bayshus waived damages, instead ordering that the accused be `hanged by his ponytail until dead'. When the Attorney General heard of the sentence, he instructed the judge to reduce it. Cyst, chastened but showing only slight leniency, did so, ordering that the prisoner be `denied herbal shampoo till the onset of split ends'. His concluding remarks, `... and let that be a lesson to all such offenders who fail to babble incessantly about star signs, numerology, auras and psychic readings', caused the Johannesburg College of Hairdressing to introduce `Basic Boredom' and `Advanced Banalities' into its curriculum.'<br />`Braxfield: The Hanging Judge?' is a cautionary tale. If we ignore it, we stand condemned.	2004-07-18

Jascha Heifetz was undoubtedly the greatest violinist of the 20th Century, performing in theaters throughout the world and to audiences enraptured by the beauty of his musical gift. He shared this gift for more than 80 years, acquiring not only lasting esteem but also enduring friendships. Sadly, it was one of these friendships that was responsible for the abiding self-doubt that characterized his later years. As Agus writes on pages 90 to 94;<br /><br />'In 1972, Leonard Bernstein argued against Heifetz's claim that the terms 'pop star' and 'intelligence' were not mutually exclusive. Their public feud made headlines around the world as Bernstein continued to invade the stages of performers such as Gary Glitter, Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart and the Sex Pistols, shouting to the audiences, \\"See? I'm right!\\" Unable to produce breathing, sentient evidence to the contrary, Heifetz had no choice but to concede defeat in May, 1979. Humiliated and disillusioned, he then fled into self-imposed exile. For the normally ebullient violinist, these were dark, discordant days, and in one of his poignant letters to me, sent from a neo-Kantian sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, Jascha wrote,<br /><br />'Ayke... my life is now bereft of meaning... there is no pizzi to my cato... you know anyone who wants to buy a cheap fiddle?'<br /><br />Needless to say, I was furious with Bernstein. He snapped up the violin before I'd even had a chance to make Jascha an offer.'<br /><br />'Heifetz As I Knew Him' is a passionate tribute to an exceptional individual.	2004-06-23

Cummings' is a precise account of a unique, creative poet. Richard S. Kennedy has made sense of the seemingly incoherent mind that made the literary world spin in a profoundly deconstructed orbit during the period following Cummings' graduation from the Harvard School of Arts and Sciences in 1916. Perhaps the most significant element of Kennedy's book is the previously unpublished Cummings' poem discovered in the dusty closet of a Tunisian Bed&amp;Beakfast he'd occupied in 1931. Titled 'Insanity is Just a Mind of State', it is one of Cummings' most autobiographical works, revealing the poet's life-long regret that he'd never wrestled an alligator. The lament, on page 79, reads:<br />'i'm mad; say they<br />but Almonds aren't NUTS!<br />(is) thE river SEINE in pariS;?'<br />The human mind is a beautiful thing.	2004-06-20

Kaufmann has produced an outstanding text. His research is meticulous and his prose style highly readable. Freud, Adler and Jung are presented accurately, and the reader is given fresh insights into tested psychoanalytical theory. This is a scholarly work of international significance, made even more profound by the incident detailed in Chapter 4. During his research at the Smithsonian Institution, Kaufmann discovered some hitherto unpublished correspondence relating to the sensational rift between Adler and Freud in 1912. The initial letter, dated May 12 of that year, read:<br />`Freud,<br />I have discovered the secret of the Unconscious. It does not repose in your Libido Theory. Resulting from Birth Trauma, all actions, reactions, thoughts and motivations derive from a desire for strudel - strudel with and without cinnamon, lightly dusted strudel with a piquant cheese platter to follow and strudel from Room Service.<br />Our association is henceforth terminated.<br />Yours, Adler.'<br />Freud replied by return post:<br />`My Dear Addled (Oops! Pardon the Slip),<br />After analyzing your letter, I am of the firm belief that you are quite a few granny smiths short of the full bushel. And one more thing - may I act as your agent regarding the paperback rights to any future cookbook?<br />Yours, for only 10% of net receipts,<br />Siggie.'<br />There is no record of Adler replying, but his book, `The Psychodynamics of Desserts', was released for the 1913 Christmas rush.

Many 'names' are mentioned and lots of secrets revealed. Reilly, a competent, articulate author, writes with rich humour and energy, and his anecdotes are hilarious. My favourite, which features me, Lee Trevino, Frank Sinatra and a state senator, appears on pages 89 to 94:<br />'It was 1972. Augusta. A skins game. I was caddying for Frank Sinatra. The other three players were Trevino, Schwarz and a senator from Michigan. The senator had skinned most of the cash, and with one hole to play, the pot stood at $25,000. As we approached the 18th green, Trevino offered to pay for the round when it was over. Sinatra, who had witnessed the senator pencil in a '1' at the par-5 15th, was having none of it. \\"Get the round now,\\" he said as he grabbed a .45 from his bag, \\"and I'll load it. I've shot a lousy score so now I'm gonna shoot a lousy politician. Hey! Get back here you bum! Schwarz, stop flexing and get after him!\\" I think the senator's still running, although not for office.'<br />'Who's Your Caddy?' is a book that will be enjoyed by avid golfers and those just out for a walk with a really heavy bag.	2003-12-19

George Jacobs writes with affection and respect, never once descending into character assassination or prurient insinuation. On the other hand, Jacobs is careful to avoid hollow flattery, so his memoir is not an attempt to present Mr Sinatra as St Francis of Las Vegas. This is Frank with his shirt off and his pants down. And his pants hurriedly zipped up before Marilyn's husband came in. And his pants torn as he scrambled over Ava's side fence. And his pants ripped to shreds by a Rottweiler while he was skinny-dipping in Greta's pool. And his pants set on fire when Princess Grace smoked afterwards. And his pants left behind as he fled out the back door of Mrs Giancana's house just seconds before Sam drove up. As Jacobs writes on page 157, 'The only thing larger than Frank's capacity to womanize was his trouser bill, which in 1961 totalled $64,573.'<br />Frank Sinatra left behind a prodigious legacy, mostly in blue or grey cotton, usually crumpled and always without identification in the pockets.	2003-12-14

Peter Niels Heller's assiduous scholarship and precise analyses combine to create a portrait that is both compelling and frightening. Drawn into professional boxing at the age of 19, Tyson quickly established himself as the boxer to beat. No-one could. Ultimately, he defeated himself, being sentenced to six years in prison in 1992. However, rather than surrender to the nihilism of incarceration, Tyson fought back. As Heller says on page 126, 'He was on his personal canvas, the Celestial Referee was about to count 9, and then it happened; Tyson stood up, bowed but unbeaten. With renewed energy, he determined that he would change; become a better person. The miracle had begun, and within a month he was working on a lathe in the carpentry shop, turning himself into a model prisoner first, a fruit bowl second and finally an elaborate rocking horse. So impressed were the authorities that they gave the boxer early release and a free white ant inspection.'<br />These days, Tyson continues to be an ornament, proudly positioned on Don King's mantlepiece.	2003-11-11

The female nude is a beautiful subject for developing line and texture, and Sidaway explains how to achieve a level of expertise in easy to follow steps. As a beginner myself, I found the advice invaluable.<br />As well as being a book focusing on technique, the author lightens the text with anecdotes. On pages 34-41, he recounts an incident involving me and two of my artist friends:<br />'Schwarz had been having private lessons in my studio and was beginning to blossom as a real painter. So I gave him my book and told him to study it at home. From what he told me later, he showed it to Sylvester Stallone and Woody Allen one night in his apartment, just before Goldie Hawn was to arrive. Woody was ecstatic and urged Schwarz to ask Goldie if they could paint her nude. Apparently Stallone emitted some sort of bovine bellow, rubbed his perspiring hands together and fetched a pencil from the phone stand. Not long after, Goldie arrived, beautiful as always, and after some small talk and tall cocktails, Schwarz gathered enough gumption to stammer, &quot;Goldie, can Sly and Woody and I paint you in the nude?&quot; Without hesitating, Goldie replied, &quot;Sure, guys, but leave your socks on. I just adore argyles.&quot; So the three shed everything, including their inhibitions, and all went well till Goldie said that Sly's pencil was blunt through overuse and that Woody's name was a gross overstatement of his reaction. Fearing a similar assessment, Schwarz quickly covered himself with postage stamp.'<br />Ian Sidaway's book is a practical, easily read manual.	2003-11-01

Joe Conason and Gene Lyons have cited credible sources and their writing is both perceptive and objective. The authors' clear prose is both elegant and economical, as this brief passage on page 92 demonstrates; 'Bill looked at Hillary. Hillary looked at Bill. Al Gore looked at Hillary. Hillary looked at Tipper Gore. Tipper looked at Monica. Monica lit a cigar. Al smiled. Hillary lit a cigar. Al grinned. Tipper lit a cigar. Al lit a cigar. Oblivious to the showering sprinklers just triggered by the smoke, Bill lit two cigars. Cuba never had it so good.'<br />The authors also have the ability to make minor details major insights. On page 115, they quote the conversation between Bill and Hillary straight after Bill had recanted his innocence on national television; 'Bill was relieved. \\"I should have done that a long time ago,\\" he said. \\"Honeyhips, the guilt's lifted. I feel like a new man.\\" Placing a reassuring hand on Bill's Viagra tablets, Hillary nodded and replied, \\"I know what you mean, Studster. I feel like a new man too. Now where did I put Ozzie Osbourne's phone number?\\"'<br />The portrayal of Monica Lewinsky is accurate without being judgemental. On page 46, the authors write, 'Monica was the lamb in the flock of interns. White-souled and vulnerable, she finally surrendered to the wolf-wild blandishments of the older man. Bill knew her weak point; her soft spot. Boy, did he know her soft spot!'<br />This remarkable book leaves no question unanswered, and we at last learn the truth about the infamous role played by Teddy Kennedy in disguising Monica as the Iranian Ambassador in order to facilitate her late-night visits to the presidential 'playroom'.<br />As the authors state in the book's final line, 'Bill and Hillary thought they had close support from among the various committee members, but with friends like that, who needs enemas'.<br />This is a story that had to be told.s is a story that had to be told.	2003-10-30

Goulding is a superb account of the masters who infused our creative culture with immeasurable richness. While we might question the rankings Goulding assigns each composer, because of personal preference, there would be an almost unanimous acceptance of the composers themselves.<br />My favourite is Franz Schubert, and Goulding, in a deliciously revealing biography, finally solves the mystery surrounding the 3rd and 4th movements of Schubert's famous 'Unfinished' 8th Symphony.  After months of research at the University of Vienna, Goulding discovered an unpublished letter dated April 6, 1822, from Schubert to his friend, the German poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. After weeks of meticulous translating, Goulding was both astonished and gratified. He had the answer that had evaded scholars for years. The translated letter, on page 73, reads:<br />'Dear Wolfie<br />Last night occurred a profound event. I was engaged upon the creation of my most ambitious work, my Eighth Symphony. I had taken no solid sustenance or beverage for 72 hours, and my eyes were heavy from fatigue.  As I began the 3rd movement, utterly detached from prosaic cogency by some mystical, musical maelstrom, Heidi, my young housekeeper, suddenly burst into the room and said, \\"Herr Schubert, you must rest and take nourishment.

It relates to the famous 'International Incident of 1996', and O'Neal is candid about his pivotal role:<br />'I first saw him in Europe and I'll never forget his name; Teodor Dobrowski. He played center for the Warsaw Warriors and he was a giant. Great skills. Hands the size of frisbees. By all reports a standup guy. So when he told me he wanted to settle in America, I arranged for him to try out for the Lakers. Even let him stay at my place. Eat my food. Drink my beer. Date my girl. He wanted to show his gratitude so he offered to sell me his family castle in Krakow for only $7000. I gave him cash. Big mistake. There was no castle. Not even a family. The bum scammed me. So I stuck him on an ageing Aeroflot and wished him luck. All of it bad. End of story. And he got those cuts and bruises when he fell out of the cab on the way to the airport. Honest. If I'd known that diplomats would later be recalled, two embassies closed, the Secretary of State ordered back to Washington and the UN General Assembly reconvened, I might have actually paid the cabfare before running away at the terminal. Do I regret sending the grifter back to Warsaw? Never. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's being touched by a 10-foot Pole.'<br />When 'Shaq Talks Back', you'd better listen.

But since reading Sharon Anthony Bower's wonderful words, I can now assert myself. For instance, last week I went back to the bookshop and asked for a new copy because the one I'd been sold was stained. The woman behind the counter inspected the stains, looked at me and said, \\"Hey, I remember you from high school. The dumb kid who couldn't even read alphabet soup. Everyone! Look who it is...

I'm now down to only 6 meals before lunchtime and I don't feel a day over 84. Although the whole book is wonderful, you should focus on a few specific sections. Chapter 3, 'Stop Eating Completely and Live Longer!', speaks for itself and in Chapter 6, Agatston provides information on the different types of food groups and explains why fats aren't good for you, especially when they cause death. Chapter 7, 'Snacking on Chocolate' is brilliant, as is the final chapter that presents 100 recipes in which lettuce is the sole ingredient.

The first was to elucidate, in an abstruse colloquiality, the inherent dynamism of mystical exposition in a post-anti-intellectual epoch while simultaneously pre-empting myriad polarities arising from the tentativation of unscholarly ignorance predicated upon, yet not essentially inimical to, the clarity of confluence.<br />'The second reason for publishing was to extract from the inexplicable a discourse on deliniation between fact as fiction and fiction as didacticism, albeit well-intended, and to then distil that discourse till potency of purpose became integral to procedural rectitude without the attendant self-proclamation of justified revelation.<br />'The third reason was to communicate clearly and effectively.'<br />Such was the effect of this book that I no longer feel I need to read any others on the subject of Tarot.	2003-10-03
US	26233346	R3NTBGKZQXB7ZW	0440224675	313045692	Hannibal	Books	5	13	21	N	N	A Superb Psychological Thriller	Thomas Harris's 'Hannibal' is suspense at its finest. Harris is able to capture a 'sense of the sinister' with precision and textual economy, sustaining the mood throughout the story. From the genesis to the denoument, the novel's potency is preserved.<br />Three vignettes are worth mentioning. The first, on pages 65-68, is a brilliant case study of the psychotic mind. Here we see Lecter exercising his pathological disdain for accepted social behaviour by openly flossing after eating Steak Tartare at Maxim's. To compound his plunge into darkness, Lecter refuses to tip, stating coldly, \\"I knew I should have gone to Burger King. Doesn't that clown in the kitchen know how to cook a raw meat dish?\\"<br />The second, on pages 145-157, demonstrates the author's dexterity with character development. In this defining passage, Clarice Starling declines Lecter's invitation to go ballroom dancing in a skilfully constructed interplay that includes the line, \\"But Hannibaby, I've heard you trip not only the light fantastic but everything else on the dance floor!\\"<br />The final excerpt validates the author's reputation as a master of both conflict and pathos. On pages 212-236, Mason Verger, one of Lecter's surviving victims, is hospitalized, and the mood is taut. The intensity develops, eventually exploding when Verger shouts to the trembling nurse, \\"Will you get this pelican out of my nightshirt! I said I wanted a bed-bath, not a bird-bath! If that creep hadn't eaten my hands, I'd wring its neck!\\".<br />Thomas Harris is a wiley wordsmith and his book is a classic. And it seems apposite here to clarify my reason for turning down a role in the film. It wasn't the money, as reported in 'Rolling Stone'. It was because I hadn't played a pelican before and my agent said I'd never get the walk right.	2003-10-03

Unlike some other writings on this subject, this book has the ring of truth, achieved principally through textual conviction, energy and clarity.<br />Two significant passages illustrate the compelling nature of the treatise. In the Preface, Tart explains the genesis of his soul-mind-journeying: 'It happened one Saturday afternoon. I'd just finished group therapy when my spirit-guide called long-distance (collect!) and told me to go to India with Robert. Bob had fully recovered from his do-it-yourself lobotomy and was keen to leave, but as it was rush hour, we couldn't find an empty cab to Bombay. So we phoned Delta but all flights were booked out. It was at that epiphanic moment that Robert suggested we try the out-of-body thing and it worked. Mind you, the food and service weren't nearly as good, but at least we didn't have to pack much stuff. And these days, with all the astral miles we've clocked up, we always get an upgrade to Nirvana Class.'<br />In Chapter 3, Peterson describes an encounter he and Tart had with Shirley MacLaine during one of their trips; 'Shirley had just stopped to give way to a passing comet when we pulled up behind her. She then tried to move off but her core-essence stalled. I waited two nanoseconds then mind-honked her. This she didn't appreciate, judging by the stream of expletives she telepathically bombarded us with. Good heavens! The lady was not only out of her body, she was also out of her mind!'<br />'Out of Body Experiences' sets the benchmark for the genre, and anyone with half a brain will enjoy this book.	2003-09-29

As with the nuts beside the martini, I had to have more. Characters and events compelled me to turn the page almost before I'd finished it, and not a single word left a sour taste. Many passages are memorable, none moreso than the incident mentioned on page 134.<br />'It was April 14, 2001, and Julia Roberts was having a clandestine supper with Ozzie Osbourne. Daniel Boulud came to their table and suggested to Ozzie that he have the 'Seinfeld Special'. Feigning intelligence, Ozzie opened his eyes momentarily and said, \\"No thanks. I'm a vegetable.\\"<br />Boulud was bemused. \\"Don't you mean vegetarian?\\"<br />\\"No he doesn't,\\" Julia said, adjusting his tie and oxygen mask. \\"But I'll try it. If it's anything like the show, then I'll love it.\\"<br />\\"Honey,\\" Ozzie said, drifting in and out of insensibility, \\"if it's anything like the show, it'll repeat on you at least three times a day for the next fifteen years and in every town and city you visit.\\"<br />Julia laughed so much that she almost knocked her Oscar off the table. Ozzie slid under it. As lasting friendships go, this one did.'<br />If you enjoy good food, interesting people and wonderful literature, 'The Fourth Star' is an essential experience.	2003-09-29

He details his early life as a 'made' guy and candidly recounts appalling activities such as extortion, gambling, running numbers, blackmail of politicians, hanging around with life insurance salesmen and attending amateur poetry readings.<br />In Chapter 4, Eddie explains the infamous 'Code of Impressions', and expounds the fundamental 'Ethic of Appearance'. On page 68 he says, 'Grooming was everything. You didn't never leave the house without a gun, a baseball bat, a chainsaw, dynamite, an acid bath, a Barry Manilow CD in case real torture was needed, your comb and a small vanity mirror. Let's face it; who's gonna take a standover guy serious if his suit ain't shined or his hair don't have one of them layered cuts from The Family's in-house coiffeur, Mario 'The Mincer' Roselli.'<br />There's only one small inaccuracy in Mackenzie's story, and as it pertains to my work, it needs to be corrected. On page 144, Eddie states that at the 1992 Palermo Film Festival, `Terminator 2' was unanimously voted `Best Conflict Resolution Video' by the members of SNACK (Sensitive New Age Contract Killers). The vote wasn't unanimous. Carmine `The Lens' Gambino abstained because he shot not only the film but also every critic who panned it.	2003-09-29

I sold my copy to Russell Crowe for $45 more than I paid for it, and the 'actor' read it in two hours. The title, that is. A year later, after he'd finished the actual book, Crowe called me and said excitedly, &quot;Schwarz, it works! At first I thought this was a great book but by the final page I was smart enough to see that it's the worstest thing what has ever been wrote.&quot;<br />I sat back in my chair, lit a cigar with the $50 note Crowe had paid me for my unread copy, and said, &quot;Russ, you're a genius.&quot;<br />&quot;A what?

Frey has provided the aspiring novelist with an invaluable guide for improving both content and style. Frey's rich experience in the field is inspirational. He writes with clarity and energy and each chapter is replete with positive advice.  Frey leads the reader through the complete writing process, from an idea's inception to its ultimate flowering. Some examples worth citing are:<br />Structure (Chapter 2); 'Try to avoid predictability. Start at the middle, then do the end and finish with the beginning.'<br />Language (Chapter 3); 'Avoid cliches like the plague. They make all writing dull as dishwater. If you use mixed metaphors, you are skating on thin ice and could end up in hot water. An inclination towards hyperbole, or exaggeration, is a million times worse than any other problem. Don't confuse tenses because publishers will rejected manuscripts that have been containing obvious errors. Don't use a big word when a breviloquent one can be just as effective. And finally, never start a sentence with a conjunction and punctuate correctly?'<br />Editing (Chapter 6); 'Revise your work at lest five (6) times before you sended it to a agent or an publisher.'<br />If you follow the steps that Frey has so carefully detailed in this book, your unpublished days will be numbered. Around 15,000.	2003-09-29

His research is detailed and the results appear as clear, unadorned prose. Each chapter is a cogent unity in itself, yet each builds upon the other to create a synaptic skyscraper. De Bono certainly knows his subject, as the final sentence of his 'Preface' demonstrates: 'Wear your 6 Hats of Intelligence as often as you can, providing it's not windy and preferably not at the same time because you'll look ridiculous. And above all, have them blocked regularly.' With De Bono leading humankind into The Forest of Fulfilment, the rest of us had better carry a Compass of Concern and a carton of bread crumbs.	2003-09-25

D'Souza writes with affection and balance, citing credible sources where necessary. Chronological accuracy is sustained throughout the text, and sensationalism is avoided. However, there is one incident that must be corrected. On page 36, D'Souza writes, 'On that momentous day in 1980, Nancy was given the honor of telling her husband that he had won. Mr Reagan sighed deeply and said, 'I am truly humbled.'' That's not quite the way it went. During a conversation I recently had with Nancy in the mosh pit at an Eminem 'concert', she was adamant that Ron had actually spluttered, 'Me? President of the United States? That's fantastic!

Annette Lust presents the history of the artists with clarity and sustained interest. Her timeline is impeccable and her characters lively. Her power is particularly evident when Marcel Marceau is introduced. The pantomime's  genius is apparent in every sentence, and the author highlights the purity of his timing. Marceau, like his 1947 creation `Bip', is seen as enigmatic, and I agree with Annette's assessment. I had the good fortune to meet Monsieur Marceau when we were both guests on the 'Tonight Show' with Johnny Carson in 1988. Marcel was naturally reticent, so Carson filled the silences with bird calls and beverage gargling. Near the end of the interview, the frustrated host asked Marcel to explain his miming philosophy. Marcel looked at me, pondered briefly and replied, &quot;.&quot; Impressed, Carson announced effusively, &quot;Fantastic! I couldn't have said it better myself.&quot; So I was somewhat surprised when, during the ad break, Johnny dragged me off-stage and fumed, &quot;Schwarz, can you believe that clown?

After reading each section thoroughly, I realized for the first time that there was more to the enjoyment of intimacy than I had imagined. Chapter 3, titled 'Once A Year Is Not Enough', made me re-think my schedule. I still only get it once a year, but at least Gray has made me aware.<br />Another excellent piece of advice comes in Chapter 5, where Gray states controversially, 'Don't be afraid to experiment; try new things, like undressing. It may seem unnatural at first, but hey...we've all got wobbly bits.'<br />This is also a valuable manual for those just starting a physical relationship. Topics for the 'nookie' novice include 'How Come You've Got THREE?', 'Batteries Are A Girl's Best Friend', 'No, Susan, Fellatio Wasn't That Italian Film Director Married to Sophia Loren' and 'Bob and Carol and Bill and Monica'.<br />'Mars and Venus in the Bedroom' is a 'must-read' book.

A simple story told with complex texture, the bird symbolizes the ineffable longings within humanity for a transcendental epiphany; a neon in the night of our stumblings; flash! I see! I hear! I fly! Valleys of failure and hills of hope are the topographic text through which the tale travels, and white-winged and wide are our stretchings towards self-actualization. This is a work of singular vision, aided by a slight editorial suggestion by me. Beak had just finished the final draft and we were sitting together on Santa Monica pier, feeding bread to the gathering gulls. Hundreds of the wretched creatures, all squawking and pecking and flapping. It was like being in the centre of a feathery blizzard and we were covered in gull-goo and crumbs. Fearing for our lives and an exorbitant dry-cleaning bill, we decamped to the safety of a nearby bar. After a dozen or so fortifying flagons, Beak unwrapped the splattered manuscript and showed me the title. Something about it wasn't quite right, so I propped the stupefied scribbler back into his chair and said, \\"Richie, sure the bird idea's got legs, but Jonathan Livingston TURKEY? When those flocking gulls disappear, take a stumble along the beach and see what else you can come up with.\\"	2003-09-24
