The smaller bits of informatio, and the way they are highlighted to stand out with relevant information is presented, I appreciate. <br /> <br />So, I was not surprised when I found Internet Poker for Dummies to be very helpful as well.  I am an avid online poker player, and feel recently that my developement has been stalled.  I purchased this book, because I liked that it related to Internet Poker, which has several different nuances that you can't overlook when playing online vs. live game. <br /> <br />While some of the concepts and tips they recommend go in direct opposition to my normaly conservative style of play, I do really find value in their explainations about WHY these would be good/better bets to make or better ways to play certain hands.  It also covers freeroll tourney's, which I found a very honest look at the nature of freerolls and how to succeed with them. <br /> <br />If you have any interest in online poker success, this is a book that belongs in your home poker library.	2005-02-28

Most of the 'tidbits' in here can be found on most email forwards.  There is nothing original about this book, and it's really kind of passive-agressive in it's attempts to portray 'family harmony.' <br /> <br />And how interesting it is that all the positive reviewers have only written one review ever for Amazon.  I'm sure, since this review is negative, one of said reviewers will object to this, but, before you base a purchase decision on positive praise, make sure you take that praise with a grain of salt and question why this was the only book those who love this book ever reviwed.	2005-02-23

I cannot refer to this as a 'diet' book, because that can give it negative connotations, and it's really not about 'dieting.'  You aren't given a target weight...you aren't restricted to nothing but meat patties and eggs, carb rationing, etc.  Denise takes an approach in this book that is based largely on female physiology and just good, plain sense.    One of the things I REALLY loved about this program is that it is about 'retraining' your body to eat and to excercise.  Her food program emphasises different aspects of healthy eating every week...so at the end of six weeks, you have retrained yourself into eating healthier, and, subsequently...letting the calories take care of themselves.  One week emphasises portion control...another high fiber...etc.  So, with each week, you can easily apply the lessons from other weeks into your daily eating/workout plan.  Another HUGE bonus is she incorporates restuarant/fast foods into the program.  She gets modern life!    One of the reasons I have always been a huge Denise fan is she 'gets it' when she realizes people have busy schedules that can't always sandwich in an hour for a work out.  now, her program does include excercise, as any healthy lifestyle should...but it's incorporated in a way that doesn't mean you need to schedule it in your day planner.  she recommends X amount of time in the morning, but also provides you with the workout segmented so you can fit 10 minutes here....5 there.  She really respects the demands that modern life can put on a woman.    Finally, what I really appreciated most about this book was that she explains very well the differences in female body composition, and how our fat is stored, why it is...and what you should expect, realistically, from weight loss.  She gives you the 'why' behind what she does, which I think just bolsters her credibility.    This book is an amazing find for anyone who wants to get healthy and not rely on 'dieting.'	2005-02-23

I can't imagine anyone, democrat OR republican, with any shred of independant thought, taking Sean Hannity seriously.    Anyone with a passion for facts or well-thought arguments would do well to steer clear of this.  Hannity's books do have a perverse entertainment value in that one thinks...Can he really be THAT misguided?  It's very \\"Train wreck\\" style journalism.  Very bad, but you just can't seem to turn away from it.  Hannity seems to feel that 'Liberals are stupid/evil/bad' is a justifiable argument for supporting any republican philosphy.  It just doesn't hold up if you are trying to find clear, legitimate conservative arguments to broaden your perspective.    I will paraphrase a quote from the film 'The American President'..\\"someone who claims to love America but clearly hates Americans.\\"  That's sums up Hannity's view of this country, if you read closely enough.	2004-12-07

OK...Ann coulter is a traditionally educated woman...at least, that's what her bio says.  Yet, continual reading of her books leads me to belive that her education was derived the same way as many of her conclusions:  Falsely.   <br /> <br />I am glad that I didn't actually pay money for this unbelivable crap, and I urge you that, should you be in a decision to pay for this book or borrow it...for God's sakes, save your money and borrow it!  For conservatives who refer to her as a 'babe', they will love what she says and nothing I write here would sway their opinion, so if you are conservative, let's not waste more of your time reading this review of Coulter's 'work.', because no amount of actual facts would sway you anyway.   <br /> <br />However, for independants or middle liberals (If Micheal Moore is your idea of a true Democrat, then don't even try to frustrate yourself, because your head will likely explode by the second chapter.  However, if you consider your political leanings more middle ground, so you look for input from both sides, this would be a very good insight into extreme right wing philosophy.  Counter is given to bouts of dictatorial ideals (My way is right, yours isn't, and if you don't agree with me, you are sub human).  I honestly wonder, after reading this, if Coulter hasn't characterized her own persona...some of her statements are so outlandish that it's legitimately feasible to wonder if she can honestly believe this, based on her intelligence and stature, and presumed accountability.  (I serioulsy wonder how she has escaped libel lawsuits at this point.  Any checking of her 'facts' or 'notations' would yeild other readers to the same conclusion. <br /> <br />Her book purports to have insight into the workings of the liberal...but she apparently isn't tuned into herself, so I doubt her grasp of liberalism is that good, either. What I found is that Coulter is inexplicably a very sad, angry woman.  Reading between the lines, you can tell thatthere is something extremely off balance with this woman, and dare I say, she is, to rebublicans, what the KKK is to Christianity...so extreme as to have perverted the very ideals she tries to promote. <br /> <br />	2004-12-06

I bought Phil Gordon's Real Deal because, as a beginner to the game, I am overwhelmed by the amount of information out there on my new favorite passtime, and, watching Celebrity Poker Showdown, I have come to really appreciate Phil's explaination of hands and the game in general. <br /> <br />This is an EXCELLENT book for those unfamilliar with the game or new to playing but with superficial knowledge.  Phil doesn't go into alot of nitty gritty about hand percentages, tells, etc.  He gives you a very good, concise overview of poker playing, how to improve your game by understanding percentages, online poker, how to plan for a potential career as a poker player (it's not a ringing endorement, however.  But might discourage those who assume it's an easy living from quitting their day jobs.), and he gives you tons of advice and resources as to where to look for more information.  In short, Phil doesn't pretend to be the be all/end all for information.  It's a refreshing change of pace from those who represent themselves as the all too often guru's of a popular trend. <br /> <br />I have to also commend Gordon for writing in a very easy-to-read style that doesn't get bogged down in poker lingo or condescending tone.  And he writes with an amount of wit one might not expect.  It's a very easy read that doesn't require a level of knowledge on par with Doyle Brunson to understand. <br /> <br />I can highly recommend this book for the beginning poker player.  If you are very familliar with the game, it might bore you to a degree or you simply would find nothing new to the advice Gordon dispenses.	2004-10-04

I purchased this book along with Phil Gordon's 'The Real Deal' as a start to my Poker Library.  This was an excellent choice for the beginner!<br /><br />Caro's Book of Poker Tells is a treasure trove of Poker Behavioral information I was immediately able to relate to.  Playing amatuer poker, I could recall incidents detailed in the book where I was taken in by many of the tells displayed, and where I had executed them myself. It's an interesting look at how human behavior factors so prominantly into a game of cards.<br /><br />Granted, the photos are dates, and the poker tells cover ALL types of games, which, if you aren't familliar with all styles of poker, it might be confusing.  But, the book is formatted in a very easy to reference style, and isn't difficult to apply illustrations using one game to another.<br /><br />This is a definite must for anyone who wants to improve their play as well as understand the psychological element of poker better.	2004-10-04

I checked this out for reasons I still am unsure of.  What I found was exactly what you've come to expect from Paris Hilton:  Walking away wondering 'Why the hell did I pay attention to this girl?' <br /> <br />Confessions of an Heiress is occasionally witty, (no thanks to the ghostwriter who ACTUALLY wrote this:  Do we really expect she penned this herself.  yeah, right!  That would inevitably interfere with her partying lifestyle!) but really odd in it's view of a lifestyle that maybe 5 people can actually relate to. <br /> <br />I got the sense that Paris really wanted to give the audience a sense that she has some depth behind the party girl...but my impression was the 'depth' had the quivalent of a bird bath in August!  I really think she's good at being a 'party girl' and an Heiress, because she hasn't been raised any other way.   And the lifestyle she describes?  Well, let's just say those millions of hers will make some plastic surgeon VERY happy some day. <br /> <br />Overall, if you enjoy listening to a spoiled Rich Girl prattle on about her life, and you want to help give Paris the impression that she is actually EARNING money, they buy her book.  Otherwise...it just wouldn't interest the average adult reader, and could border on insulting anyone who earns their own living.	2004-09-09

I read this book on the hopes of finding some conservative insight that made sense.  What I discovered in Hannity's latest book is that I was punished with frustrating, go-no-where arguments that made no sense other than to push the Bush agenda Hannity so dearly loves. <br /> <br />I would LOVE to find...just once...a conservative commentator who could present their arguments in a manner that doesn't demonize liberals, or at least question their mental competancy.  Hannity, alas, proves that he is just another in the same vein as Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh.  Sure, it's a democracy, and that's great...unless you use your democratic will to disagree with their points of view...then you are evil, stupid, or have been duped. <br /> <br />One of Hannity's flaws I've noticed is that his argument style tends to go from A to T to F to W to B.  He can't seem to convey his arguments in a straight line.  It can't do much to convince me when following his train of thought is too difficult.  If you expect the same style you get from his radio show, you will probably be in for a disappointment. <br /> <br />He also refuses to admit any flaws with the Republican agenda or politicians.  It reeks of stubbornness and does little to convince the middle of the roads, like myself, that he has anything worthwhile to say.  His rhetoric, I find, incredibly devisive, and he can come off as wholly uniformed on many subjects.  For someone who spouts that his party wants to unify, Hannity does his best to make sure there are two kinds of people in this world...Us and Them... <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book if you are looking for True, well argued conservative insight.  If you are a Hannity fan or a true, no-holds barred conservative, this would be a good book for you.  If you really don't want to waste time or money being told you are wrong because you don't agree with a Fox News personality...move on, nothing new to see here.  It's punishment...but not that harsh	2004-09-07

While I'm not generally a fan of military books, General Franks delivers a very human insight into his life, but how our country changed, post 9/11.  <br /> <br />General Franks led our forces in the attacks on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and gives a very good account of how those missions were directed.  Franks also takes us through the workings of the Washington institutions that the military has to deal with, as well as surprisingly personal insights into his own homefront.  He really makes it a much more fascinating story than one might expect. <br /> <br />We not only learn some of how our military and government works, but how a significantly powerful man works, as he charts his life, and how decisions he made lead him to where he is today.  Fairly unextraordinary circumstances that lead to a man capable of extraordinary things.   <br /> <br />Another very welcome addition to the book is the lack of partisanship found in so many current non-fiction works.  Franks does lay blame on some things, but manages to not point fingers at Republican or Democratic institutions he's served under.  I found it very inspiring that he stayed very true to his ideals and managed to shed light on many things in a way that allows the reader to draw their own conclusions, without alot of the rhetoric we've come to expect of late. <br /> <br />I can safely recommend this book and be confident in saying that the readers won't be disappointed.	2004-09-03

I read this book, skeptical at best, because the Swiftboat Veterans for Truth ads had already been out and essentially debunked as partisan based.  I still thought it was important to try and get another light to the story. <br /> <br />Can't say I was impressed, and if nothing more, it just furthered my belief that the Swiftboat Veterans are really a mouthpiece for someone else.  Regardless of the quality of Kerry's service, the facts remain that 1.) he served in a war no one wanted to, and 2.) he received injuries during that war that our GOVERNMENT approved recognition of. <br /> <br />35 years later to come out and attack it is too little too late.  Where were these disputes when the medals were given out?  Since these men were there and served with him, couldn't they have voiced opposition then?  I just question these arguments timing, and, having already been pre-disposed after the holes poked in the arguments, I probably didn't have the right amount of 'open-mindedness- going into it. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and I'm already sick of hearing about this anyway.  That's another thing. <br /> <br />If you are remotely sick of these arguments and accusations, just steer clear of this book.  You've heard it all and frankly, why waste time on people beating a dead horse?	2004-09-02

I read Slander...and hated it.  I found that book as nothing more than stringent partisan diatribes set out to hilight the evils of Liberals.  So I figured...well, Give Treason a try.  Maybe you will get an insight, maybe Coulter has gotten her liberal hatred out of her system....blah blah blah.  <br /> <br />Sorry folks...I was wrong. <br /> <br />Coulter still reeks of Self-rightous indignation for those who don't share her view, and fails to sway her points.  AGain, she apparently got published just to float her hatred of all things liberal.  <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who said that Coulter does more to polarize than unify.  I think that is an increbily apt description.  Coulter doesn't seem to get that a smart person can recognize rational arguments and work accordingly with those.  I always end up feeling patronized by Coulter's writing, because if you don't agree with her, you are clearly dumb or evil.  Treason is a perfect example of her condescending, superior attitude. <br /> <br />Now, before Conservatives say I am trying to silence her because I don't philosophically agree with her, let me clarify.  I don't agree with her arguments moreso for the fact she writes and presents in a style that says 'If you don't agree with us, you are stupid and evil.'  She can say what she wants, and I support that.  But, free speech involves giving one a choice of who to listen to.  I simply care not to listen to her and be told if I don't agree with her, I'm thisclose to Demon Spawn. <br /> <br />Basically, if you are already a true conservative, you will find this book worthwhile.  If you consider yourself Independant, Moderate, or, God Forbid, Liberal, you will hate this book or at the very leaswt, find yourself extremely insulted that Coulter insinuates you are ignorant, stupid, or evil for not sharing her view. <br /> <br />Remember America is based on Diversity, Ann!	2004-08-31

Books	5	9	15	N	N	Terrific read in a time of partisan bias	ABC 20/20 co-anchor John Stossel has written a book every American should read.  In this time of Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh screaming for their candidates in decidedly partisan ways, Stossel is a breath of fresh air and a much needed reminder that there are rational members of the media who can present well-rounded, thoughtful arguments.  This isn't so much as a political book, as more one based on examining our society as a whole and punching through many myths and sacred institutions. But Government and partisan politics do take a chunk of his time in this book. <br /> <br />Give Me A Break takes on Democrats and Republicans alike, and the media, and government institutions.....celebrity...are toppled to the ground in this truly remarkable breath of fresh air. In his easily-conversational style, Stossel recounts the pitfalls of our government threatens to quash the inventiveness of our society. I was impressed with how 'conversational' his writing was in tone. <br /> <br />Give Me A Break is admirable in Stossel's willingness to point out his own errors, or ways he takes advantage of our loophole-filled system.  He certainly doesn't shy away from his part in it, and it lends stringent credibility to his work. He's someone who clearly heads off arguments at the pass and explains what he did wrong, how he got to the incorrect conculsions, and leaves any critics or detractors scratching their heads as to how can you argue with a guy who pulls the rug out from under himself?  It's honest and refreshing in a day and age of blantant finger-pointing and 'flip-flopping.' <br /> <br />This book in a breath of decidedly fresh air in a time of too much hot air.	2004-08-30

I borrowed this book from a friend who advised me against reading it, but, being a stubborn type, I figured, hey...it could be interesting, and could provide some insight. <br /> <br />I regret not listening to my friend.  I felt as if I had wasted precious hours that could have been spent otherwise grouting tile.  Morris seems to rewrite history himself, and does so in a most uninteresting and dull fashion.  Essentially, Rewriting History is nothing more than Morris recounting things we already knew, and adding his bitter spin on it.  It doesn't come off as insightful, interesting, or indepth.  It comes off as sour grapes.  Just completely dumb. <br /> <br />And, on another note, I gotta admit that I found the use of large type to be vaguely reminiscent of the tactics I used in high school when typing term papers or essays that were not fully developed or fleshed out.  Large print?!?!?  I'm sure the margins are smaller, too.  Aside from the lack of interesting subject matter, it's as if we are additionally duped into think there is subsance, becaue the print, I'm sure, added several pages to give the appearance of substance in more pages. <br /> <br />Senselessly, too many trees had to die to publish this book.  If you must read it, borrow it.  It's not worth keeping, and you will be better served to spend your money elsewhere in Amazon.  Or donate it to Save The Trees fund in order to keep other innocent trees from being sacrificed for this 'Old Man's Temper Tantrum' on paper!	2004-08-30

It can seem overwhelming, but really, this book is broken down so at least you feel like you have a good understanding of all the issues home ownership brings to the table.<br />Probably the most useful portion I found a little too late was the chapter on home inspection.  I really wish I had this book when I was going through the inspection process.  It gave a lot of insight as to the processes, questions to ask, etc.  I realize I got very lucky with my inspection, but next time, I'm telling you I will have that portion memorized!<br />The only part I found not useful were the sections meant more for rural housing.  Being on a city sewer, electricity, etc., she gave a lot of detail into septic systems, oil heating, etc., that had no application for me with this house.

He also doesn't bring the flaming liberalism that Michael Moore can bring, which can often cause Moore to be dismissed based on his extreme views.<br />Alterman has done a masterful job at dissecting this very complex issue and allows the facts to speak for themselves.

'Smart Women..' just reminds us that the behaviors we might be so easy to excuse at the expense of a boyfriend really are pretty awful or could signal something more.<br />I recommend this book for young women or single woman who struggles occasionally with the topsy-turvy world of dating.	2003-02-04

I have owned beagles before, both as pups and adopted as adults, so I was already familliar with the breed's behaviors, but did want to buy this for a 'refresher course' in Beag-ology.<br />This is one of the best books I have read on Beagle-owning. From behavior to feeding, breeding, etc. The writing style is very easy to digest and the information is partitioned for quick reference if you need it. Very informative and easy to understand.<br />And, if you are unfamilliar with beagles at all and are thinking of adding one to your family, I can't stress enough how helpful this book will be in either 1.) your decision-making or 2.) adoption. Anyone not used to the beagles temperment and behavior needs to get this before being faced with a bevy of adorable pups. They are as 'energetic' and destructive as they are cute and do require some atypical attention. This book explains beagle pros and cons perfectly and can provide you with adequate information necessary in deciding if a beagle is right for you.	2003-02-03

I have owned beagles before so am familliar with their behavior.  This book was recommended.<br />While I found the information in this book to be accurate, it didn't seem particularly 'user friendly.'  I found the information too encylopeadic and scholarly.  It did have good and accurate information, but it just was a little more complex than necessary.<br />If you are considering a beagle or want a book on Beagle ownership, skip this and get 'A Beagle Handbook.'  Information is the same, but a far superior book.	2003-02-03

(Simon Cowell would have a gong instead of barbs if he could!)  He really is a surprising mix of intellegence, shyness, and I would have to add genius to that list.  He is truly one of the most surprising characters in the American popular landscape.<br />Yeah, Chuck said he was a CIA assasin, and he orchestrated some interesting dating game trips as covers for his hits, and he creates an alternate life that does jump off the page, but remember, this is also the man who thought it would be a good idea to throw a man and his wife and secretary on stage for a game show.  His creativity is never in dispute.<br />This is just a great book and, while you feel like you know who Chuck Barris is when you finish it, it still leaves you wondering how well you REALLY know him.  You won't be disappointed with this surprisingly fun looks into a media pioneer.	2003-01-31

What I thought would be an indepth examination of markets and how and why they fluctuate was...but that's the simplistic version of it.  This is, by far, the most complex and detailed account of stock market behavior I think in existence.  Whether that's good or bad is entirely up to the individual reader to decide.<br />It is heavy on the mathmatical end of it, so bringing along your left brain with this book is a must.  I found it too confusing in trying to make the formulas fit with what the text was trying to tell me.  In short, I got so lost I had to reread several points, which detracted from the overall experience of learning.  It's excrutiatingly detailed, to say the least.  This isn't a bad thing, but definitely not my preference.<br />If you are highly skilled with formulas or have a LOT of time to kill reading a book, I recommend this.  Otherwise...just drop your econ professor an email.	2003-01-31

Short, sweet and just NOT worthy of an adult's attention.<br />What appears to be a good insight into finding direction in your life is ACTUALLY a disconnected portrait of many people changing their lives.  I felt the book just didn't come across as I had intended it too, and wound up feeling like I had just finished the supreme 'head scratcher' of all books.  <br />If you are looking for some direction or trying to facilitate some change in your life, do NOT waste your time or attention on this junk.

(The writing seemed a bit rough for my tastes, which is the reason I subtracted a couple of stars).  Someting about the David and Goliath nature of brainiac vs. Casino's just seened very appealing.<br />One of the things I found surprising was how they were actually able to carry out this plan for as long as they did.  Casinos as a rule tend to be fairly wise in keeping an eye on the trends of cheating. For a bunch of novices to go this far really gives it a 'rise of the little guy' feel. One of the questions the book raised for me was is it really cheating if you know the game backwards and forwards?  <br />A really good story (It would make a GREAT movie and I would be surprised if it's not made into one) that makes you think and entertains.  It's an even better story if you have ever spent any time in a casino.	2003-01-30

Tucker just basically rehashes what other books have said before. The end-of-chapter excercises are helpful and do provide you with some soul searching material. But you'd be better off borrowing it from someone or visiting the library that wasting your money on it.<br />But, if you want to buy a book on getting out of 'singledom,' I suggest 'If I'm So Great, Why Am I still Single.'by Susan Page. It's a much better book in dealing with the issue of 'don't want to be single-dom.	2003-01-09

Randy Shilts, who has since passed from this disease, wrote what has to be the most difinitive account of the genesis and proliferation of the AIDS epidemic.  If it weren't for the complexity, detail, and length of the book, it should be mandatory reading for high school students in sociology:  The way our government and society interacted and ultimately aided the spread of this disease is something I can only hope future generations will heed and learn from.<br />Shilts takes us from the first known discovery of this disease to how it became an inexplicable medical annoyance to a panic-inducing malady...in short...you learn more than you need to know.  What's interesting to note was that the government's refusal to act or to even acknowledge the disease seems to be one of the most obvious contributions to it's spread.  The saddest part is to finish the book and think 'What would have happened if...'<br />The book itself if fascination, but does go into great detail.  It's not for the casual reader.  Shilts' style jumps around to many different faces of the epidemic's early days, so you have to be prepared to jump into different stories.  If you've seent he HBO movie based on this, it serves as a good visual 'cliffs notes,' for the book.<br />I highly recommend, but add that you need to bring your concentration.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-01-08

This was a terrific book from the standpoint of having a grabbing premise, interesting Point of View, and loved the overall themes. Really a more innovative approach than I had anticipated.<br />But I felt the characters, aside from Susie, were as stereotypical as they come in the case of a grieving family. This caused me some difficulty in 'sticking with' the story, because near the end, it was as if it dawned on the author that she had to come up with an ending...so when her tone shifts...you don't really have enough of an attachment to the characters and it just ends kind of strangely, given the strong start.<br />I would recommend this, but marginally. It's a good read, but does have it's disappointing spots.	2002-12-30

I found myself loving the character of Pi, as really feeling a sense of understanding this character because we journey with him during this growth.<br />That being said...there were a lot of times I felt this was a very disjointed novel, and the story sometimes let my mind wander...which isn't good for a novel.  By the time I finished, it was like 'OK...I know a character...but what's the story?'<br />I can't recommend this unless you have an airtight attention span.	2002-12-18

My personal favorite is the one about putting out a $500 bounty with your friends for the person who fixes you up with your future spouse. <br />I would say use a gift certificate for this book, but don't waste your own money on it.

I had to purchase it at that point.<br />The recipes were an even more pleasant surprise.  Not terribly complicated, and all thus far have been really good.  <br />This would be the perfect gift for yourself, and a really interesting addition to your cookbook collection.

I have always thought Bill Maher was nothing short of brilliant.  I have disagreed with him on past issues, (Most notably his comments regarding the September 11 attacks) the man still has his facts straight, knows what he's talking about, and has the quick wit to bring home his points.<br />When You Ride Alone proves that Maher, while most-likely misunderstood, is still a brilliant humorist (I hate to use comedian just because it doesn't seem to give him the credibility he deserves) who has his finger on the American Political System much moreso than other political writers (this guy could run circles around Ann Coulter when it comes to breaking down the American Political Machine.<br />This book is definitely a must purchase.

I read this book on the recommendation of my best friend:  It didn't disappoint!<br />I LOVED the variety of the book, and the different viewpoints were comforting in that I found things to identify with in nearly every essay, which always helps to give you the 'I'm NOT the only person who feels like this and maybe I still have my sanity!' feeling.  I found it thought-provoking, comforting, funny, insightful, and sometimes irritating.<br />This isn't a curl-up-and-read-by-the-fire book, however.  No matter how much you might identify, reading this like a standard novel can wear thin on your attention span and, frankly, your nerves.  This is a great 30-minute at a time read, or before-bedtime read.  <br />And just imagine the non-verbal value of someone seeing THIS in your bookshelf!	2002-11-26

I purchased this book on the recommendation of a friend, and as a 'compantion of sorts to 'Undoing Depression.'  This was one of those rare self-help books that genuinely seems to be centered on that premise.<br />Luciani give a brilliant background to what you can get from self-helping, and explains it in a way that doesn't make you feel 1.) hopelessly inacapable of accomplishing relief from depression, 2.) explains the causes in a way that don't make you feel like a failure for developing the thought patterns in the first place, and 3.) doesn't use a lot of psychobabble, (save the exception of the inner child thing, which is just a personal irritant of mine) so you actually can see where he's tryig to get you to go.<br />I really liked his approach to focusing your recovery more internally and on reminding you that it's not an overnight process.  Another appreciation I found was that he recongized how difficult changing these patterns can be...and so you expect those hurdles, rather than get discouraged yet again.<br />I found this to be an excellent book for anyone suffering mild to moderate depression. (And I recommend buying this as a companion to 'Undoing Depression,' so you really get a good sense of what you are working with) If you are severely depressed, you should probably work through more of it before tackling self-coaching.	2002-11-15

It is terrific insight into one of the most talented songwriter's of his generation, as well as to what goes through the mind of an addict. (Those who never dealt with addiction have a difficult time understanding the nature of addiction.  Cobain at least gives disturbingly real insight into the mind of an addict)  I also thought it was incredibly sad just how isolated this man was, despite his fame and surroundings.<br />I felt Cobain came off as a much more gentle soul than my original perceptions of him had ever allowed me to consider.  I felt almost like he forsaw his life spin out of control and was just overwhelmed by the thought of stopping it.  I was thoroughly fascinated.  <br />Write him off as just another grunge-rocker junkie if you want, but if you want a fascinating portrait into a talent that hadn't even scratched the surface before it could reach it's potential, snap this up!	2002-11-07

I grew up with SNL, so this book was a nostalgic trip down memory lane.  It was also very interesting in giving you insight or validation on hunches or suspicions.  I knew I didn't like Chevy Chase for a reason!<br />I appreciated that the cast members, guest hosts, writers, etc., were allowed to give THEIR take, rather than have it processed through a writer. The end result is a lot like SNL; you're not really sure what you'll get from page to page.<br />Overall, I felt this was a fitting tribute to a pop-cultural fixture in our society.	2002-11-07

I was impressed with this books approach to working through anxiety or panic attacks. But, I didn't find anything of noteworty exception to distinguish it from other books dealing with this subject. <br />It is also a fairly 'quick' read....which, for anyone dealing with this type of issue, really should spend a little more time on. I felt like it was best served as an 'airport read; it's style just didn't lend itself to the thorough examination one struggling with panic attacks should invest in. <br />Again, well-written and easy to understand...but I don't see this as a 'life-altering' read for anyone dealing with these issues.	2002-10-18

A Definite Cut Above	For anyone who has suffered from, is suffering from, or cares for someone suffering from depression, this book is a MUST OWN.  Being in one of the above referenced categories, I had heard that this book took a much different approach to what's behind depression.<br />I was NOT disappointed in the least.<br />Rather than tell you how to fix depression, it EXPLAINS depression.  Understanding is by far the best tool in most anything to combat this illness.  One of the most valuable insights I have taken from this book was on medication.  This book deftly explains how the physical manifestations are often not in need of medication to remedy.  <br />It delves into aspects of depression I have not seen in an other 'self-help' book. It doesn't provide easy answers, and in some cases, it doesn't provide an answer; it simply gives you the facts about this often misunderstood disease and presents in in a manner that is neither intimidating or discouraging.  <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2002-10-18

I enjoyed this book if, for nothing more than it is refreshing to read something that doesn't extoll the cinematic masterpiece all film books seem to call their subjects.<br />While some of the choices may seem harsh, I must agree with most of them, (I will even admit to hating myself for the fact I can watch Grease 2, even though it is an undeniably bad film!) and some just made me cackle with delight. (The chapter on 'A Star is Born' is chock full of painful truth!)

It gave advice, and only good if you desire 'tough love' tactics.<br />While I do accept Spezanno's idea that we are responsible for how we feel...he takes that too far and essentially has you blaming yourself for everything that happens to you.  Sorry...I don't buy that at all.  I can't see how a partner could accept responsiblity for being unfaithful, or how you are responsible if your partner just doesn't want to communicate at all.  There is only so much one can take responsibility for in any relationship, and I felt strongly that Spezanno expected the reader to blame themself for their heartbreak.  Sorry...difficult to do in any situation.<br />Anything by Dr. Phil would be better than this.  Dr. Phil may be tough, but he recognizes there are two sides to every story.	2002-09-18

I find his commentary brilliant and incisive.  If you love his brand of humor, I would snap this book up.  If you don't like him...go ahead; give him a try again...you know you want to!<br />This is one of the few books that I consistantly laugh out loud while reading, but it does give you pause to think. (Those who say smoking won't kill you are lying through the hole in their trachea)  I find that social commentary delivered with a good dose of humor often is the best way to make ones point without seeming preachy.  Miller is the King of this arena.  He definitely understands the workings of American society, warts and all, and can absolutely hit the nail on the head every time.<br />This is a book that manages to deftly walk the fine line of making you think AND entertaining you.	2002-09-17

One is the lowest I can give it and that is way more than it deserves.<br />While I don't dispute that media has a liberal bias (They depend on the First Ammendment -- they need all the leway they can get), Ms. Coulter does not do her party justice for anyone who can recognize a well constructed and persuasive argument. I was shocked at how poorly this author worked through her arguments, as well as beat many a dead horse. (Several chapters were simply rehashings of previous chapters) While I don't disagree with many of the concepts Coulter attempts to examine, I felt like her argument was the literary equivalent of a temper tantrum; lots of bluster and fuss but nothing presented in a rational manner.<br />Two major problems I had with the book in general is that Coulter resorts to the acid-tongued snideness and name calling she accuses liberals of spouting. She also theorizes that Clinton's crimes were WORSE than Nixon's; an argument that sounds preposterous as it is laid out in her book. At times, I felt she simply wanted to use this book as a diatribe on how evil Bill Clinton is. I found the book generally a petty exercise in partisan politics and nothing more. <br />This is a topic worth examining, but cruise Amazon.com for something other than this book.	2002-09-04

OK, I'll admit to already being a fan of Dr. Baden's from HBO's Autopsy series.  He truly loves what he does and his ability to convey intricate scientific details in layman's terms is greatly appreciated.<br />I purchased this book after seeing him lecture, and let me tell you, this is a fascinating aspect of criminology.  The 'clues' that no one would ever think of that are left behind will amaze you in their ability to accurately point to a murderer or a cause of death.  He recounts some of him numerous consultations on cases, hi and low profile (O.J. Simpson's case for one.  That alone will explain how he may have gotten away with it) and brings it home in a way that any reader can understand.  Another thing that I found very helpful, is Dr. Baden's sincere respect for the dead.  He's not simply recounting tales to be goulish, but to illustrate how crimes can be solved when it seems there is nothing to lead to.  <br />It's not for everyone, granted.  But Dr. Baden's book is fascinating if you have even the slightest interest in criminology.	2002-08-09

The tale of the Sexton's is not for the faint of heart.  <br />This is a fairly well written book, although I will admit that the way the information was organized did not help the story flow at times.<br />But the fact that these people were allowed to escape detection for so long, (You cannot begin to fathom the twisted parentage the Sexton children were raised under.  It will chill you to the core people like this exist) is what I felt most abhorrent.  <br />While the book chronicles some of the freak show that was the Sexton Family life, I think it better serves to show just how inept our family service system has become.	2002-08-07

I purchased this book as an attempt to balance the effects of also purchasing 'Slander', and frankly, I am taken aback by the thorough illustration of what our country is headed for.  While I consider myself a member of neither party, I tend to be more Republican than Democrat when it comes to the majority of issues.  Be that as it may, after finishing this book, I am nothing short of dismayed at the state of our nation, yet it's our greatness as a nation that allows ideas like this to be expressed.  Well written, researched, and incisive, it will also scare the bejesus out of you if you think seriously about the road this work has us traveling down. (and we ARE on said road, no question.  It doesn't take a PHD)<br />I would recommend it, but be prepared.  It doesn't paint a pretty picture in the least, nor does it give you confidence that things are getting better.	2002-07-29
