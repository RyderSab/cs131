It might be a bit much to say this book does that, but it does get you accidentally thinking. It begins harmlessly enough, with rather simple, obvious ideas, and seems the sort of textbook that there's no point reading and which accompany classes there is no point taking.<br /><br />It looks to be a logic textbook, but there's nothing about Ps and Qs and this set and that element, nor arcane symbols indicating what has a union with who. In fact, the opening examples are from Spinoza--just the sort of thing to interest a professional philosopher, and further reason for the casual student to put the book down. Later examples show the book's 1972 pedigree, and are drawn from women's liberation, rap sessions, the Kennedy assasination and rock music.<br /><br />Still no Ps and Qs, but now there's a bit on organization and making those horrible outlines they always suggest in English class before writing a paper. Except it's about over organization and how those outlines aren't the best way to get the gray matter going, and the exercises help you determine your writing and thinking style and what works best with your brain. Before you know it, you can also spot false ploys in advertising, the ad hominem and card stacking fallacies in arguments, and the relation between a premise and conclusion. Finally, like some drink sneaking up on you, all this leads into four chapters of Ps and Qs, also known as inductive and deductive reasoning.<br /><br />Some thirty years later, this 1972 paperback in the original Harper and Row edition shows its age. Harper and Row is now HarperCollins, Western Washington State College where Dr. Purtill taught long since became Western Washington University, and Charlie Brown is mispelled \\"Charley Brown.\\" A new edition would be welcome, but if some of the examples seem quaint, the book remains a relatively painless workout for the synapses and bulking up on the Ps and Qs.the synapses and bulking up on the Ps and Qs.	2005-10-09

On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.\\" That profound quote from Oscar Wilde leading off the robot section tells you that this is not simply another stylish, colour- drenched coffee table collector's book, but one which marries brief text and evocative photos to cast its subject in a new light. \\"This book celebrates the design, novelty and colour of these highly fascinating toys,\\" the authors write, exactly the same elements that readers and collectors find so fascinating.<br /><br />In 225 pages, they present hundreds of colour photos of rare and iconic robots and space toys, along with brief informative blurbs. A rare feature is a listing of manufacturers' marks, both fascinating and helpful in identifying toys. Another rarity is the many photos of original boxes, along with numerous colour and style variants. Amazon suggests you buy this book along with Blast Off! I'd make the same suggestion. Blast Off! has lots of reading, unusual in a collector's book, while the stunning photography and layout lift this British book well above the ordinary.	2005-10-08

The only reason kids are reading things like Harry Potter is because things like Alexander Key's series are out of print. I'm certainly not suggesting buying these books used for $40, but do what you can to get them back into print. Like many authors, Key hit hard times through no fault of his own: libraries, in their rash rush for \\"educational\\" books, phased out Sprockets, A Little Robot, Rivets and Sprockets, and Bolts, the Robot Dog, and I don't even need to name the sort of books they replaced them with. In a democracy, librarian would be an elected office, and that sort of librarian would be impeached.<br /><br />A second blow was that these books were published by Westminster Press, one of those small, unstable publishers that like tiny fish in a big ocean, are continually eaten by bigger fish which, for some reason, resemble a certain sort of librarian. Keeping books out of print is no different than burning them as in Ray Bradbury's story, Farenheit 451, but if no editor reading this was ever a kid and wants to see these books back in print, I'd suggest the Key estate go to Author House and bring them back themselves. There are plenty of hungry fans waiting at Amazon to launch a reading revolution and welcome back Sprockets and friends.	2005-10-04

But nowhere was it more glorious than on the front page of The Eagle, a weekly British boys' paper, in Frank Hampson's visionary comic serial, Dan Dare. The Eagle was published from 1950 through 1969 by the Christian Publicity Society and Hampson also drew a never-rivaled story comic of the life of Jesus of Nazareth called \\"The Road of Courage.\\" As he says in an interview in this volume, Hampson wasn't religious, but he felt that \\"young people were getting a rough deal in those years so soon after the end of the war...I wanted to give them something that made the future more hopeful, in human terms.\\"<br /><br />Hampson gave unstintingly, creating one of the most visually arresting comics ever, until the Eagle was taken over by corporate raiders, and the job fell to his friend, an equally fine artist, Frank Bellamy. As with Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Dan Dare spun off numerous toys highly valued by collectors (Young, Duin and Richardson devote an entire chapter to Dan Dare in their book, Blast Off!: Rockets, Robots, Ray Guns, and Rarities from the Golden Age of Space Toys, Dark Horse Books), and in its heyday, 60,000 junior spacemen pledged their loyalty in the Eagle Club.<br /><br />Titan Books, UK, has launched an ambitious publishing project to reprint all the color, two-page Dan Dare cliff-hanger strips in beautiful 9\\" X 12\\" hard cover, coffee table hardbacks. \\"The Red Moon Mystery\\" was the second Eagle serial, after \\"Pilot of the Future,\\" and was originally published from vol. 2 #26 - vol. 3 #11 of the Eagle. As comic artist Cliff Claremont (X-Men) writes in the introduction, the weekly arrival of Dan Dare was one of the few things to lighten the gloom and doom of post-war Britain. As such, many now- grown fans will welcome his return.

That beautiful series is now collectible and rare, the holy graal of Little Lulu collectors, but Dark Horse, with these new, affordable editions, has brought Marge's unsinkable moppet within reach of everyone. How do the series compare?<br /><br />Amazon calls \\"Lulu Goes Shopping\\" volume one, but the Dark Horse edition is labeled #4, and contains seven comics that were originally published between November 1948 and June 1949 as \\"Marge's Little Lulu\\" issues six through twelve. This roughly corresponds to volume four, set two of the first series of the Another Rainbow set, which contained comics 6-11. The comics in \\"Lulu Goes Shopping\\" are in black and white, as were the Another Rainbow sets, with a full color cover featuring Irving Tripp's original art from issue number six. The AR set included color plates of all the covers, and a short feature in the comic, \\"Lulu's Diry,\\" left out of the DH collections.<br /><br />All of which is to say that Lulu lovers may still want to track down the AR sets which are far easier to find than the original comics, but at about ten bucks a book, Dark Horse has done a great job with Marge's Little Lulu, which is sure to win new fans and readers as it has every time it's been republished since Marge's first single panel comic in the Saturday Evening Post in 1935.<br /><br />The genius of the comics is writer par excellence, John Stanley (Melvin Monster, Thirteen Going on Eighteen), but the back cover depicts the latest Lulu incarnation, CINAR's delightful cartoon series, seen on HBO, The Little Lulu Show, collected on DVD as \\"The Best of Little Lulu\\" (see my Amazon guide, \\"Cartoons Without Cable\\" for more information). \\"Dark Horse is really galloping\\" is how The HoLLywood Eclectern, the newsletter of all things Lulu, described the new Dark Horse series.

But whereas the language of Brit lit may appear quaint or quizzical to Americans, it's the ideas in American lit that often prove puzzling. What is going on behind Moby Dick? What explains the odd tone of Hawthorne's short stories? What's behind the transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau? Where did Locke get those ideas that made their way into the Declaration of Independence?<br /><br />The Goodly Word is a revised, inexpensive paperback edition of The Pursuit of Power: Studies in the Vocabulary of Puritanism, which appeared in a 1995 hardback library edition as Volume 180, Series VII, Theology and Religion in the American University Studies series published by Peter Lang. There it would have languished, ensconced in the halls of academia, provoking comments from a few well-read seminarians, had not Clements publishing rescued it and, in this inexpensive edition, made it available to us all.<br /><br />Lucky for us, because The Goodly Word proves an indispensable guide to early American politics, religion and letters. \\"Any history of ideas is also a history of language, and any history of language is also illuminating of social history,\\" writes Dr. Johnson, Professor Emeritus of American Literature at Western Washington University. Rather than an in-depth chronological history, Johnson gives us a brief overview of the use of language and key ideas of a variety of thinkers and writers, including Jonathan Edwards, William James, Henry Adams, Isaac Newton, de Toqueville, Cotton Mather, Sampson Reed, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, and William Ames. Brief essays also illuminate the culture and vocabulary of Puritanism.<br /><br />Of the first edition, Dr. Stanley Tag of St. Olaf College wrote: \\"I am unaware of another book that sets out to trace the larger patterns and influence of Puritan vocabulary on American intellectual development in such a thorough and provocative manner.\\" Johnson's portrait of Henry Adams not only paints him as a precursor of modern feminism, but suggests a way out of the current \\"gender\\" debacle. Jonathan Edwards strikes a modern chord when he calls for \\"religion of the heart and not the head.\\" And in \\"Individualism from Tocqueville to Whitman\\", Johnson traces the roots of modern individualism, which we take for granted, back to when they appeared as utterly new.<br /><br />Johnson finally pays the Puritans a great compliment. They produced, he suggests, a counterpoint to the leveling tendencies of democracy in an aristocracy not of birth, but of worth: in their emphasis on 'individual inventiveness and personal productivity,' he maintains, they may have \\"saved American democracy from itself.\\"Johnson's portrait of Henry Adams not only paints him as a precursor of modern feminism, but suggests a way out of the current \\"gender\\" debacle.

Baby Boomers will fondly remember Scholastic Book Services before they were a mainstream publisher, and little four page weekly reader newspapers that were passed out in class. Books cost about 50 cents and you'd order them together as a class. What a great stake in classroom reading, how fun to take home your books from class, and how different than a $30 Harry Potter hardback. And what great books they were: Encyclopedia Brown, The Amazing Adventures of Alvin Fernald (part of which showed up on TV), Danny Dunn and the Homework Machine (predating PCs) are a few that come to mind. The Runaway Robot was a classic among classics, penned by golden age sci-fi author Lester Del Rey, and now collectible for it's space-theme cover. These are only a few of the great books modern librarians cycled out of libraries in their continuing war on the imagination. But until someone reprints gems like these, my advice is order yours used, and discover this long- lost classic. You'll be glad you did.	2005-09-19

Lewis are sometimes surprised to learn that his popular book, Mere Christianity, was adapted from BBC wartime radio \\"broadcast talks.\\" Dorothy L. Sayers, known for her Lord Peter Whimsey detective novels, also penned dozens of pamphlets, essays and broadsides, many adapted from her popular talks. Her subject is similar to fellow Anglican Lewis: the role of the Church in wartime, but her approach is somewhat different than Lewis'. In \\"Creed or Chaos\\" and \\"The Dogma is the Drama\\" she argues for the excitement of doctrine, oxymoronic as that may seem, but she does so in scintillating prose: \\"We have effectively pared the claws of the Lion of Judah, certified him 'meek and mild' and recommended him as a household pet for pale curates and pious old ladies.\\" In other essays she probes the nature of creativity, drawing on her own experience as an author and playwright to illuminate her views.<br /><br />This collection does not exhaust Sayers' essays, but collects seven from her 1947 book, Creed or Chaos,  and other works including Unpopular Opinions, and Begin Here. This collection also seems hastily edited, with numerous typos. The book cover reads, \\"Includes discussion questions,\\" which seem to have been inadvertently omitted. Nevertheless, reading Dorothy L. Sayers is an unforgettable experience, and this volume provides a good introduction to a fascinating and provocative thinker and writer. Essays include: 1. The Greatest Drama Ever Staged; 2. What Do We Believe?; 3. The Dogma is the Drama; 4. The Image of God; 5. Creative Mind; 6. Creed or Chaos; 7. Strong Meat; 8. The Other Six Deadly Sins; 9.

It's the sort of little book that makes the best reading, brief and inspirational. Jonathan Livingston Seagull and Mr. God, This is Anna are other books of this sort. Not long novels, not perfectly written, but full of heart and soul. The really surprising thing about this book is that it's Catholic and from 1928, but it's not so surprising when you consider its inspirations.<br /><br />Obviously, Connolly had read Chesterton, and the most exuberant of his books. He everywhere follows Chesterton's dictum in his novel Manalive: \\"At certain strange epochs it is necessary to have another kind of priests, called poets, to remind men that they are not dead yet.\\" Mr. Connolly is such a poet, and Mr. Blue is such a man alive. Mr. Blue also refers to being God's spies. This is a line from Shakespeare's King Lear that Malcolm Muggeridge is also fond of quoting. Connolly also read Chesterton's best non-fiction book, Orthodoxy, and Mr. Blue both lives out \\"The Ethics of Elfland\\" and defends \\"The Flag of the World.\\"<br /><br />Not everyone has read Chesterton, but everyone has met someone who is part Mr. Blue (or is so themselves), and is happier and livelier for it. \\"It's a great mistake to think God is chiefly interested in religion,\\" wrote Archbishop Temple. For anyone making that mistake, your penance is to read Mr. Blue.	2005-07-16

Nobody does it better than Jean Kerr, and why they don't reprint her books is a mystery to me.<br /><br />I thought my love of her book, Please Don't Eat the Daisies, was a guilty secret until I saw others in the English program at my college carrying it around, drinking it in, and, like me, hoping to imbibe her easy, generous, humorous style. I think she is in love with both life and writing and I dream of the imminent Jean Kerr revival. Then the refreshing waters will wash over the desert of dry as dust prose that has been cranked out for fifty years, and we who have sampled the occasional book here and there will dive into the lake of the publishing revival. Then the TV series of Please Don't Eat the Daisies, and not only the Doris Day movie of it, will be available on DVD. For the present, I can only advise those who think the humourous essay is dead (or never existed) to avoid the rush and discover Jean Kerr now.	2005-07-16

Not only was it the funniest book I'd ever read, but it was enlightening also. Like most casual readers, it never occurred to me that writers would lie, but here was this writer exposing them. \\"Frank Harris: His Life and Lies\\" is perhaps the most direct unveiling, but all these essays question the general view of their subjects. Later he would come to question the very mechanisms of media, and the way that these views come about. Seen this way, he is not about disrobing this or that highly esteemed or highly placed personage, as simply providing yet another instance of the emperor having no clothes. Shorn of the pretensions of power, we are all the same, as he approvingly quotes St. Francis: \\"naked on the naked earth.\\"<br /><br />Simon and Schuster also issued a similarly named volume, The Most of P.G Wodehouse. Although that volume lacks the alliteration of \\"The Most of Malcolm Muggeridge\\", the two authors have something else in common. The same books appear under different titles, to the continued annoyance of their respective readers. The Most of MM is an American edition of the quite similar British collection, Tread Softly for You Tread on My Jokes. They share the same introduction and many of the same essays. I give the differences here for those who may want to track them down.<br /><br />There are 47 essays collected in The Most of MM, and only 39 in Tread Softly. Some of the funniest, like \\"The First Church of Christ Economist,\\" are only in the American volume, which includes all the essays in the English one. Most essays are from the '50s and '60s, and originally appeared in such publications as Encounter, Esquire, The New Republic, The Observer, The New York Review of Books, The Spectator and The Sunday Telegraph.<br /><br />While most of the bits are about something else, there are some that illuminate MM's own life. \\"The Queen and I\\" elucidates the absurd misunderstanding that got MM kicked off the BBC. \\"The Wodehouse Affair\\" illuminates the equally absurd instance whereby Wodehouse was labeled personna non grata in Britain. \\"Many Winters Ago in Moscow\\" touches on his reporting of the famine in the USSR caused by forced collectivization under Stalin, which made him very unpopular among American journalists of the day, who conveniently ignored it, along with other believers in the \\"Soviet experiment.\\" These essays both leave the reader skeptical of of the veracity of media and aware of what a writer can do who rises to his or her  high calling.understanding that got MM kicked off the BBC. \\"The Wodehouse Affair\\" illuminates the equally absurd instance whereby Wodehouse was labeled personna non grata in Britain. \\"Many Winters Ago in Moscow\\" touches on his reporting of the famine in the USSR caused by forced collectivization under Stalin, which made him very unpopular among American journalists of the day, who conveniently ignored it, along with other believers in the \\"Soviet experiment.\\" These essays both leave the reader skeptical of of the veracity of media and aware of what a writer can do who rises to his or her  high calling.	2005-07-15

This is the last book Mr. M. wrote, and the only one after becoming Catholic. It was previously published in England as \\"Conversion\\" and in America as \\"Confessions of a Twentieth Century Pilgrim\\". This paperback is the third title variation. It's sort of two books in one. Since there never was a third and concluding volume of his autobiography, The Chronicles of Wasted Time, Conversion sort of fills that bill. Second, MM follows his stated intent of reflecting on conversion. Intertwining the two approaches allows the author to slide back and forth between them.<br /><br />Had not Muggeridge already wrritten two volumes of an unimaginably good autobiography, this book might get five stars. Its four star rating is merely relative to these others. That said, almost anything anyone likes about reading MM is here in spades. It's full of self-relfective bits, some of which recur in his other writings. The form allows memory to traverse backwards, dipping down here and there for the amusing anecdote and diverting story, yet these nearly always usher into some shaking insight as from a saint in the making--or maybe a gargoyle, laughing down from his steep perch midway between two worlds.<br /><br />He refers to himself in the third person, as \\"the student,\\" \\"the journalist,\\" or \\"the soldier,\\" thus avoiding the problematic \\"I\\" of the autobiography, and allowing him to revisit and comment on the range of experiences covered more closely in the Chronicles and elsewhere. He also writes from memory, whether quoting St. Augustine and Simone Weil, or recalling his own adventures, with very little attribution.<br /><br />Conversion, for Muggeridge, wasn't a late in life one-time experience (as might be thought), but a slow process over time, definitively formed when he met Mother Teresa, and continuing throughout life. Seasoned readers of Mr. M. may find this to be the best part of the book, which includes a letter from Mother Teresa and musings on The Cloud of Unknowing. Readers new to MM will also find this a good place to start, as he briefly touches here and there on topics that he delves deeper into in other books. Thus, Conversion is both a third Chronicle and a sort of road map leading readers to discover the inimitable MM.this a good place to start, as he briefly touches here and there on topics that he delves deeper into in other books.

But while both books deal with end times, that's where the similarities end. In Benson's vision, Catholics are the last remaining Christians. The Left Behind books, named for a line in Larry Norman's song, \\"I Wish We'd All Been Ready,\\" on the other hand, follow the idea of the rapture popularized in Hal Lindsey's bestselling book, The Late Great Planet Earth.<br /><br />I ordered this book from Amazon after reading Gwen Watkins' essay in Charles Williams: A Celebration (also available from Amazon) comparing Benson and Williams as writers. Williams being my favorite author, I was very excited to come upon a similarly gifted novelist. Benson wrote Lord of the World in 1907; it takes place in a future about a century later (around now). That's also around the time that Chesterton wrote his novels. Both he and Benson write so colorfully that it's sometimes hard to know what's going on. Whether people were more imaginative then or that was the style at the turn of the century I don't know. But having read GKC helps one read Benson, and vice versa.<br /><br />Williams is often held to be obscure for his descriptions of supernatural and occultic ritual. Benson's obscurity lies in his pre-Vatican II Catholic vocabulary and bits of the Latin Mass, which will not be familiar to many readers. That aside, this is an absolutely gripping story. Having once started, I couldn't put the book down. Uncannily, in this 1907 novel, Benson prophesied a dark future that became reality, first in Germany and then in the USSR. Writing in the then new genre of science fiction, he envisioned a technologically advanced world nevertheless rushing headlong to destruction. It's amazing how contemporary he sounds as he looks forward in time to our present and his future.	2005-07-08

Wodehouse once remarked, and novice readers who have dipped into a Jeeves or Mulliner story must be wondering how long their luck will last. How long until they come on to some dog of a novel that forever smirches the name Wodehouse? Well, as opposed to nearly anyone else you can name, all the Wodehouse exhibits I've delved into so far have all been Very Readable or above. Not a dog in the bunch, except in the good sense of the dumb chums and interminable pekes collected in the Wodehouse Bestiary.<br /><br />But Quick Service was a favorite of PGW, whom you would think would know his own mind. This light novel from 1940 mixes equal parts musical comedy and whatever else his books are about, with some hysterical lines. \\"Oo!\\" said Miss Pym, pouring beer in a flutter. That's the response of the copper-coloured haired barmaid at the pub in Loose Chippings to the question posed by young artist and man-of-action, Joss Weatherby, who's madly in love with Sally Fairmile, \\"Isn't marriage a wonderful institution?\\" Miss Pym is dreaming of her betrothed, butler Sidney Chibnall, but that monosyllable is fraught with meaning, because she and Sidney are on to a gang of plotters, with Joss as suspect number one. An avid reader of mysteries, she warns Chibnall: \\"pretty silly you'd look if you suddenly found him murdering you in your bed.\\"<br /><br />Of course there's about a million other things happening with the cast of dozens, and this is one of the few Wodehouse romps where I can follow all the romantic embroilments. This very visual book could easily be performed on stage given the music hall bits dropped in all through it, as when Miss Pym tries to draw out a stranger with a false mustache. \\"You can always tell an American,\\" she says, \\"but you can't tell him much. Ha ha.\\" \\"Ha ha,\\" replies the other, the gag falling flat like a card played in a deadly cat and mouse game of intrigue, as Miss Pym might say. It's just about perfect.'s just about perfect.	2005-06-26

Steve also often names his pieces after his songs or vice versa, which is the first thing that makes this book great; the interconnectedness of all things Steve Scott, for whom life and art and faith are not disconnected pursuits. This book, like his music, like his poetry yells that they don't have to be. If that isn't good news for the artist, I don't know what is.<br /><br />This book sort of picks up where Crying for a Vision (Stride Books, England) left off, but really both books are a jumble of essays loosely organized around a common theme, and not very \\"booky\\" at all. Having said that, House will still be over many reader's heads, and they'll naturally be tempted to put it down. I don't advise that: instead jump around. Skip the way deep histories in the first two chapters and dive in later. \\"A Jar of Dead Flies\\" ran in some version in now defunct True Tunes magazine. Part of \\"Am I Really Here or Is it Just Art?\\" appeared in HM magazine (just celebrating 20 years--see my magazine guide to get it from Amazon), which is to say they really are independent essays.<br /><br />\\"Am I Really Here\\" relates to Scott's poetry over tape loops album, The Butterfly Effect, which it would be very cool to read and then listen to respectively in an arts/ reading group. House is full of bits like that (the last two essays are projects) that could be discussed over a cup of joe (or a pint of Guiness), with each member of the group bringing examples from their own or other's art (it would really open up the part on post-modernism to thrash it out in a group).<br /><br />Christianity Today had an article on how traditionally Catholic and various stripes of Protestant colleges are regaining their original vision, which sort of means that how they reinvent themselves is up for grabs. I can't even imagine what might happen if someone used House as a textbook. Imagine reading a book about art by someone who actually made art. Steve Scott's now and then chapbooks, The Boundaries, are being collected into one volume by Stride, and Crying for a Vision is due to be reprinted.<br /><br />Steve's CDs are also (sometimes) available through RadRockers.com (search under Scott). The 77s were his back up band on Love in the Western World, which RadRockers called \\" a deliciously creepy, way before its time alternative rock classic, with similarities to David Bowie, Roxy Music and the Police...Lyrically deep and brilliant, with vocal inflections similar to Lou Reed.\\" His other rock collections are Magnificent Obsession and Lost Horizon. His other albums are more experimental, like The Butterfly Effect, or Crossing the Boundaries, which was part of an installation with visual painter Gaylen Stewart, Empty Orchestra (the literal meaning of Karaoke), and More Than a Dream (odd reversions of Scott rock songs).

The best way I can put it is that reading CW heightens the physical world. What do CW readers know? The same things as everybody else, but they know they know, and as the drug takes effect, as it were, begin to see everywhere the pattern of the glory. That is certainly what you get reading CW, or I do every time I reread War in Heaven or bits of Taliesin or Descent of the Dove. And then myself so longing, by great good luck I came upon this volume of essays.<br /><br />There are lots of good books of this sort on Lewis, Tolkien, and other writers. Two that come to mind are The Riddle of Joy (on Chesterton and Lewis) and Permanent Things (on Dorothy L. Sayers, Evelyn Waugh and others). But it's rare to find such a collection on Williams. These essays were written for or assembled by the British Charles Williams Society over two decades. The book is as discursive and full of misspellings as these sorts of volumes tend to be, but yet absolutely fascinating. The best bits in such essays are not usually those tending to the main thesis, but the highways and byways getting there. In Eric Routley's essay, when the idea of the Puritans and the idea of Williams meet, it is the idea of the Puritans that changes. He views prose as \\"passing a pencil\\" and poetry as \\"throwing a ball.\\" CW is decidedly in the latter camp, and if you miss a few tosses, it's all the more satisfying when they hit the glove. Huw Mordacai's essay, \\"Charles Williams and the Occult,\\" fills in far more than I previously knew about his Golden Dawn associations, and Gwen Watkins may have some of us (this reader included) reading R.H. Benson's novels, convinced that R.H.B. and C.W. are twin souls. Many of the authors in this volume are well-known for books published after the 1995 publication date. How can I mention only three of the eighteen essays? What about the other fifteen? They wait for you to join the celebration.e authors in this volume are well-known for books published after the 1995 publication date. How can I mention only three of the eighteen essays?

Or you could get this beautiful, color, hardbound Dark Horse edition of the first seven comics, not for the retail $50, but for a much lower Amazon price. Baby Boomers will remember Manning's ground- breaking classic, which everywhere raised the bar for sci-fi comics, but newer readers who may have discovered Magnus through the many later comics and graphic novels editions, will also be delighted to discover the original source.<br /><br />Manning is known for his work on Tarzan and other comics, and his art in Magnus is a delight to the eye, with a sweeping painterly style reminiscent of Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon comics. Unheard of at the time, he was also allowed to sign his comics for Gold Key, the later comics imprint of Western Publishing, which had also published Dell comics.<br /><br />NorthAm, the continent-spanning city of the 41st century, is completely run by, and completely dependent on, robots which obey a variant of Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics. Forseeing this dangerous trend, a Yoda-like robot named A1 (does that sound like AI?) raises an orphan human named Magnus to fight robots should the need arise. He trains his body as a well-oiled machine until he can deliver karate chops with \\"steel smashing strength.\\" For various reasons, some robots turn against humans and try to destroy NorthAm, often in the employ of a human dictator, and Magnus is called out as a man on a mission. In the style of early 'sixties sci-fi, Manning always closed with a moral, that we must never become too dependent on technology, and that it is meant to be the servant of man.<br /><br />Manning created a host of intriguing robot designs (some of them resemble Ideal's Zeroids), and this book includes all seven original Gold Key covers (without the text), as well as a brief bio of Manning and Foreword by Mike Royer. Now when so many comics and cartoons are spun off from licensed properties, it's amazing to think that in his designs and stories for Magnus, Manning created an original hero and unique millieu that are still inspiring today.many comics and cartoons are spun off from licensed properties, it's amazing to think that in his designs and stories for Magnus, Manning created an original hero and unique millieu that are still inspiring today.	2005-05-08

I can't add anything to the excellent review here, except my brief reflections. Wherever you are on your journey, don't fail to discover this wise and witty writer. This brief autobiographical book takes up where Christ the Tiger left off, except for the passing of time in between. Tiger is Howard's Seven Storey Mountain; it takes you to the point of decision and then drops off.<br /><br />The action picks up some years later, as it were, in this book. In between, Howard spun out a half dozen musings. One of the most popular was Evangelical is Not Enough; but that book was an argument. This one is a journey. The result of that argument and somewhat of the journey was arguably his best book, On Being Catholic. It would be unfortunate if non-Catholics stayed away from that book, since long-time readers will recognize and rejoice in his luminous style, deft turns of phrase, and graceful blend of reflection and rumination.<br /><br />The Secret of New York Revealed is another wonderful bit of autobiography which pieces together bits of the past in a style reminiscent of his best apologetics book, Chance or the Dance. If you're a long-time Thomas Howard reader, don't miss his mature writing. The secret of his likeable style? Thomas Howard writes not to convert the reader, but to convert himself. But don't be surprised if you want to go along on the journey.	2005-04-29
US	51096197	RE5BB5Y432RBA	1585674796	534656019	Ukridge	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Corky, Old Horse	Reviewers of Ukridge seem to be diffident, and the discussion tends to center on their view of one Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge, leading light and subject of said book. Missing the point, I'd say. When P.G.W. introduced this large and in charge Man of Affairs in Love Amoung the Chickens, he knew he was on to a good thing, and that they would travel many miles together. When, more brilliantly still, he hit upon Corky Pirbright as narrator and true blue friend of our dauntless hero, he laid a path that he himself would retread many times, in the Oldest Member, in Mr. Mulliner, in the unsinkable Bertie Wooster, and even in the occasional Drones Club Member.<br /><br />He struck gold, I'd say, in these first sketches of the faithful but tempermentally at odds narrator who, for all his seeming passivity, is yet crucial to the plot. These early stories are a bit much taken together, but they read delightfully when sprinkled in anthologies or as an occasional hiatus for readers engrossed in Jeeves or Blandings novels. Taken that way, some of them are very good indeed, notably \\"Ukridge's Dog College\\" (early on done for television) and Ukridge's Accident Syndicate, which unleashes the blue blood of the sportsman that will play so much a part in the fortunes and misfortunes of Bingo, Uncle Fred, and others who like a little flutter, down to the most savvy of them all, the inimitable Jeeves. These stories stand alone, as do most of the earlier PGW bits, being largely written for serialisation or as one offs for magazines, particularly the Saturday Evening Post, but at least three of them tie together to tell the tales of Battling Billson, an early type of the pugilists who later would be so much a part of the world of Wooster, and these tales, especially, show young Wodehouse well on his way.	2005-04-17

And there are three volumes of it!\\" Are there now four volumes? Yes and no. The Lost Tales are not newly- written novels seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the trilogy, but previously unpublished manuscripts only now seeing the light of day. As such, they are a mixed bag. Each book can be read on its own, but those who have read the trilogy will find numerous crossovers in the overlapping stories: recurring characters, common mythology, and that they all relate in some way to the story and locale of Kaphtu (ancient Crete).<br /><br />The second book in the Lost Tales series, The Eleusinian Gate, fills in and expands on events in the original trilogy, and might be considered a successor, whereas The Gryphon Seal is largely set in England, as explained on the cover blurb: \\"Vicki Marsden, an orphan in Edwardian England, little dreams she will encounter the eminent figures of the day: King Edward the Seventh, archeologist Arthur Evans, suffragette Christobel Pankhurst, and journalist G.K. Chesterton. But her adventures are just beginning, as the must travel through time to discover the secret of The Gryphon Seal.\\"<br /><br />Purtill tackles something few authors do: writing in the first person. And it's not the same person in all his books. The narrator of The Gryphon Seal is Vicki Marsden. The Golden Gryphon Feather and Murdercon have female narrators. The Stolen Goddess and The Parallel Man have male narrators. The most ambitious book of the Kaphtu Trilogy, The Mirror of Helen, is told from four perspectives: two male and two female. There is, therefore, no consistent third person narrative voice that carries through all his books, and thus they may appear wildly inconsistent; a given reader may relate far better to the protagonist and style of one book than another. Unusual again, Purtill writes across the genres: mythology/ fantasy, science fiction, mysteries, and nearly unclassifiable short stories, all of which, like the Lost Tales, may someday reappear.<br /><br />Like many prolific authors, Purtill writes at white heat and doesn't like to edit. I nevertheless think The Gryphon Seal would benefit from more careful editing. It's longer than the trilogy books, but also far more packed. It may be that the Trilogy books have raised the bar impossibly high, but the one book of the The Gryphon Seal could have been expanded into a second trilogy. As it is, the book tells more than it shows, and there are places that retread the back story of the trilogy for readers unfamiliar with the history of Kaphtu. In my opinion, the Kaphtu Trilogy is a better place to start. Nevertheless, trilogy readers will likely welcome the Lost Tales, noting and delighting in the echoes and resonances of the earlier books, and the invitation to return to the Bright Lands.ies, and nearly unclassifiable short stories, all of which, like the Lost Tales, may someday reappear.

This is an oversized, paperback, large-print edition from the oddly-named publisher, International Polygonics (IPL). I don't think a smaller font version exists in paperback. In the preface D.R. Benson says that If I Were You makes use of a bit of plot from W.S. Gilbert (as in Gilbert and Sullivan), and the sense of theatre runs throughout. Add \\"enter stage right\\" and \\"exit stage left\\" in a few places and you'd have a corking good play. Add singing and you'd have a sprightly musical. For fans who enjoy seeing Plum's \\"other life\\" in musical comedy creep into the books.	2005-02-10

Everything he touches, it seems, turns to laughter. Other places the commedia del arte takes place in motion picture studios, on cruise ships, at resorts on the French Riviera, but here the venue is the Hotel Cosmopolis, drawn, no doubt, from his observations of New York nightlife. And here's Archie, a good-hearted, bumbling Brit out to seek his fortune in the colonies. And of course he met a girl while vacationing. And of course she's a millionaire's daughter. And of course said millionaire is proprietor of said hotel. Does it sound like a formula? Right ho! a formula for fun. Richard Usborne says this book is a lot of stiched together stories. But so what? Ukridge is a lot of not stiched together stories. This book introduces one of Wodehouse's best heroines, Lucille, as the power behind the throne of the Lucy/Archie axis, together pitted against her anti-Archie father.

Wodehouse Collection)	Books	5	21	21	N	Y	Best of the Green	If you wanted to read all of Wodehouse's golf stories at once, you'd want the Golf Omnibus. If you'd rather not lug around a phone book-sized volume, however, you may prefer this moveable feast of a dozen prime Plum stories (a baker's dozen if you count the preface by D.R. Benson), the best of Wodehouse on the links. Unlike the pocket paperbacks of some Wodehouse editions, with print so small you nearly need a magnifying lens, this oversized \\"quality\\" paperback nearly qualifies as a \\"large print edition.\\" So it's really the best of both worlds, requiring neither a microscope nor a forklift for enjoyment.<br /><br />Reading Plum on golf, however, is like playing a familiar course; the same stories are scattered throughout various editions. All of these stories have appeared elsewhere. Fore! opens with a very funny story that is quite unlike most of his golf tales, \\"The Coming of Gowf,\\" which originally appeared in Golf Without Tears (1924), as did four other stories. That's the American title of a book that appeared in Britain as The Clicking of Cuthbert (1922). Five stories appeared in the American collection, Divots (1927), published in England as The Heart of a Goof (1926). The final tales are from Nothing Serious (1950/1951), published in both British and American editions. For golfers with a literary bent, here's the best imaginable introduction to P.G.

Wodehouse (Thames and Hudson Literary Lives Series), James Connolly offers this advice: \\"Relax and reread Wodehouse; he's the boy to restore a sense of proportion.\\" Absolutely good advice. I find rereading Wodehouse is more enjoyable than most first reads of other authors, and he's quite easy to reread, even if you don't intend to, because his stories appear in various collections and his novels were often published under various titles.<br /><br />Something Fresh, officially the first book in the Blandings Castle saga, was published as \\"Something New\\" as a serial in The Saturday Evening Post in 1915, and then as a book with the same title in an American edition. \\"Something Fresh\\" is a slightly altered British edition of that book. Ashe Marson, the unknown author of the hard-boiled Gridley Quayle, Investigator series of paperback pulps, answers an ad: \\"WANTED--Young Man of Good Appearance, who is poor and reckless, to undertake delicate and dangerous enterprise. Good pay for the right man.\\" Poor and reckless is a formula in Wodehouse for a good-hearted, down on his luck guy, about to be smiled upon by a beneficent Providence. It's a carry-over from his work in musical comedy and as a struggling writer, but he is one of the few authors who make his leading characters writers, and one of the very few who throws them any of the good parts.<br /><br />This book is a double bonus, with not only Ashe, but a female writer, Joan Valentine, who knows even more of the hard-bitten life of the streets, and is therefore even poorer and more reckless, as a stellar second in the personnel. Throw in all sorts of millionaires and mix-ups, maids and butlers, a loveable, old, potty Earl, and the beginning of the crime wave at Blandings, and you have the makings of either a rollicking musical comedy or a long series of delightful novels. With Wodehouse it was both. He alternated between the two worlds and if Something Fresh were a film or a musical, Ashe and Joan would no doubt break into song and start dancing about the parlour, as do Gracie Allen, George Burns and Fred Astaire in the Gershwin Brothers' film adaption of Wodehouse's novel, A Damsel in Distress. Why four stars? You can't give everything five, and in my view, as good as Something Fresh is, some of the later Wodehouse novels (such as the Jeeves, Mulliner and Drones Stories) are even better.doubt break into song and start dancing about the parlour, as do Gracie Allen, George Burns and Fred Astaire in the Gershwin Brothers' film adaption of Wodehouse's novel, A Damsel in Distress.

Wodehouse: A Biography	Books	4	22	24	N	N	A Peach of a Bio on Plum	I am somewhat diffident about biographies, and I think our age has no taste for them. The reason is that they reveal more about the author than their subject. So unless you're a voracious reader, you'd far rather read something else. Bios of Wodehouse are particularly suspect. Firstly, hardly anyone is as good a writer as PGW, and therefore the bio will be less engaging than its subject. Secondly, hardly anyone in the hard-bitten writing trade is as amiable as PGW, and therefore their bio will be less enjoyable than their subject. Regardless of these obstacles, there is still good reason for the itinerant biographer to charge ahead: that is because PGW has been the object of a sustained attack, and mired in a smokescreen of disinformation. Someone must rise to the challenge to clear the air, and hopefully, his good name.<br /><br />And someone has. Stephen Fry, who gave us the unforgettable Jeeves in the wonderful videos of Jeeves and Wooster, long ago raised one eyebrow (Jeeves' equivalent to two thumbs up) in favor of Donaldson's vita, and for good reason. Having full access to the collected papers of Richard Usborne (author of Plum Sauce) re: Plum's Berlin broadcasts, she delves in to set the record straight, so that, as writer Evelyn Waugh devoutly hoped, Britain can at last hug its greatest national humourist to its bosom.<br /><br />That cloud dispelled, she takes us on a walking tour of the sorts of places we tourists are anxious to visit: Plum's ancestral home, where we search the grounds for a bevvy of aunts, his young days as a schoolboy and sportsman, where we look for the type of Malvern House, to the Hollywood stint whose flickering light would grace so many books, the clubs and cronies forever resonant in \\"Drones\\" and \\"Blandings,\\" the pekes of Ukridge's dog wash, and a lifelong devotion to the \\"dumb chums.\\" And of course we wonder whether Plum ever smothered Ethel's upturned face with kisses and called her \\"My Rabbit.\\"<br /><br />The mind boggles at the enormity of her task, but Donaldson has somehow won the day. Twin souls with the reader, she seems to share our distaste of bilge literature and instead shows us how Plum shines through in his engaging and enjoyable books. How can one reply but in the words of one Wooster to another soul who saved the day? Donaldson, you're a wonder.s at the enormity of her task, but Donaldson has somehow won the day.

The first sort retreads all the old ground of the life of what-his-name: blah blah blah, and then subjects the dry-as-dust \\"facts\\" to some sort of psychological analysis to liven them up. Absolutely to be avoided. In the second sort, the author engages the subject as Jacob wrestled with the angel: as does a real life, it seems not a finished product, but a work in progress. To this second class Ian Hunter's bio of Malcolm Muggeridge happily belongs. The author is just as passionate, maverick, and opinionated as his subject. \\"A life\\" is an apt subtitle, for in this book Muggers, as his pals called him, comes alive.<br /><br />Hunter makes the keen observation that MM is perceived differently in his homeland of England than on the other side of the Atlantic, and this book, originally published in Britain, rounds out a lot for the American reader. Here is the straight scoop on three occasions in the life of MM that most people only know in rumours: his repatriating of humor writer P.G. Wodehouse, who was then being called a traitor in the British press; his reporting of the deliberately induced famine in Russia under Stalin, for which he was called a liar in the American press (Walter Duranty reported in the New York Times that there was no famine, so eager was he that the Russian experiment succeed) (see [[ASIN:1570759057 Time and Eternity: The Uncollected Writings of Malcolm Muggeridge]]; and his so-called mocking of the Queen, for which he was kicked off the BBC and done down by his enemies in the British press (Hunter reveals he actually made a positive comment about the queen).<br /><br />Hunter writes from both personal acquaintance with Muggeridge and an easy familiarity with his writings, so that it's not always easy to tell when his paraphrases of Malcolm's ideas leave off and Hunter's take over. But while that's a flaw in the first type of biography, it's really a boon in the second type. How to contain the dynamo that is Malcolm Muggeridge? Thankfully, Hunter doesn't try, instead letting his subject roam restlessly through the pages, the dynamo churning through the prose. This book seems the tip of the iceberg, and in that sense does what all good bios do: sends its readers to its subject, hungering for more.alcolm Muggeridge?

The diehard Wodehouse reader, having savoured of the Master's best, may justly wonder what possible good can come of yet another reviewer shoving in his oar. Suddenly noticing how warm it is, I run a finger around my collar, and fumble out, in a manner reminiscent of one Bertie Wooster, the only possible answer: \\"Er...I rather thought I would.\\"<br /><br />Strengthened by a beaker and overcoming my diffidence, I warm to my theme: that there aren't many books from 1903, that is to say, over 100 years ago, that one still feels like reading. And it's rather ripping, really, that this book is really three books: The Pothunters, A Prefect's Uncle, and Tales of St. Austin's. I mean more for your money, what? And the last tome is really a lot of short stories, with a longish one rivaling anything Plum ever wrote.<br /><br />Adding that most of them were scrawled out for a boys' rag called The Captain, and that they're all about the good ol' school and cricket and footer and all that, and given all the bilge being shoved out these days on the reading public, odds on twenty-five to one that my readers would give them a miss, not knowing that they're red-hot stuff. As someone said--I think it was the poet Burns. Jeeves would know. No wait--it was Colin McInnes: \\"Behind this seemingly effortless performance there is infinite skill, and a splendid, kindly wisdom; and in these early books, we can observe the young Wodehouse learning to enchant us with these two rare and beautiful gifts.\\" Or maybe it was the poet Burns. Anyway, it's a ripping good read.	2004-12-08

Although I only know of Vatican II second hand, in the forward Rev. Richard John Neuhaus suggests that the visionary, stirring language of this eminently readable volume also recalls the pontificate of Pope John XXIII.<br /><br />What makes these talks the more remarkable is when they were given. In 1998, as the world fretted over dire omens of the coming millenium, waiting for the doomsday bug to offline the world's computers, in the Chair of Peter there was eager anticipation as John Paul II prepared for the Great Jubilee 2000, the Year of the Holy Spirit, and the Springtime of Evangelization. The reason for his optimistic outlook is given in the very first meeting, when the bishops of New York came \\"ad limina apostolorum,\\" to the Vatican and the \\"doorstep of the apostles.\\" \\"Freed from sin and washed in the blood of the Lamb, we have truly become children of God, able to turn to him in absolute confidence for we know that he loves us and will never abandon us.\\" Could Billy Graham put it better?<br /><br />\\"The men and women of today,\\" he continues, \\"are yearning for salvation. They wish to rediscover the truth of God's dominion over creation and history, to encounter his self-revelation, and to experience his merciful love in all the dimensions of their lives.\\" For those unfamiliar with the pope's writing, the rest of this surprising book is an exercise in mythbusting. I was certainly taken aback to find this succinct comment on post-modernism as \\"uncertainty, raised to a principle by which it is denied that we can ever know the truth of things.\\"<br /><br />I refrain from quoting a great deal more only to spare the casual reader and to let those enticed to read this book delve in for themselves, but at a time when music at Mass and the liturgy are under attack and review, we might consider this penetrating insight made a half decade before: \\"The use of the vernacular has certainly opened up the treasures of the liturgy to all who take part, but this does not mean that the Latin language, and especially the chants which are so superbly adapted to the genius of the Roman Rite, should be wholly abandoned...the Roman Rite is again distinctive in the balance it strikes between a spareness and a richness of emotion: it feeds the heart and the mind, the body and the soul.\\" And who can fail to be stirred by the spirit of hope that runs through this book and its rallying call: \\"the challenge is enormous, but the time is right.\\"casual reader and to let those enticed to read this book delve in for themselves, but at a time when music at Mass and the liturgy are under attack and review, we might consider this penetrating insight made a half decade before: \\"The use of the vernacular has certainly opened up the treasures of the liturgy to all who take part, but this does not mean that the Latin language, and especially the chants which are so superbly adapted to the genius of the Roman Rite, should be wholly abandoned...the Roman Rite is again distinctive in the balance it strikes between a spareness and a richness of emotion: it feeds the heart and the mind, the body and the soul.\\" And who can fail to be stirred by the spirit of hope that runs through this book and its rallying call: \\"the challenge is enormous, but the time is right.\\"	2004-12-07

Neil Gaiman was 2004 Guest of Honor at Mythcon, the Mythopoeic Society's annual shindig. Their bulletin, Mythprint (Vol 41 No. 10, Oct. 2004) includes the text of his remarks on the effect of three writers on his own work: C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and G.K. Chesterton (mythsoc.org). With these muses to inspire him, it's no wonder he's become the premier fantasist across the board, from Sandman and graphic novels to co-writing Alice Cooper's rock opera, The Last Temptation, to Neverwhere and his own prolific output, to the present collaboration.<br /><br />That said, I would wish for more of the ghost of Doug Adams, but that's a given these days for anything I read (except P.G. Wodehouse, whom Adams stamped \\"the funniest writer in English,\\" Doug having a penchant for understatement). Good Omens, in case you missed the other three hundred reviews, is about an angel and a demon who decide they like earth and plot to put off Armageddon. The best characters are Crowley the demon and Aziriphale the angel. I'd gladly read a whole series of their adventures. The authors also handle the adult humans rather well, but where this book absolutely bogs down is in the bits about four kids, one of whom is the Antichrist. Neil and Terry need more cartoons in their video diet (who doesn't?). Watch Rugrats and Ed, Edd and Eddy and figure out how kids talk. Unfortunately, you can't skip these parts because the plot turns on them, lifeless and dead wood though they are. It also helps if you've seen The Omen, which the authors cannot help playing off of. All in all, this book isn't nearly as bad as most books the New York Times likes, even if it did make the bestseller list. It's also ready for Disney to pick up the movie option because of the many Queen songs Crowley plays in his car. Since Hollywood Records owns the Queen catalog, this means the film sountrack is ready to go. May I suggest another Hollywood Records property, Stryper, to kick out the jams on the angelic side? \\"Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly,\\" Chesterton once quipped. In that sense, the authors, along with the demon Crowley, find themselves on the side of the angels.wns the Queen catalog, this means the film sountrack is ready to go.

Anyone who read the inteview with Carl Olson and Sandra Miesel in the July 24 issue of the National Catholic Register is probably rushing to order this book. I have read Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which struck me as the inspiration for The Da Vinci Code, and which Olson and Miesel also analyze at length, and found it interesting until it revealed itself as just another of those &quot;Jesus didn't rise from the dead&quot; books.<br /><br /> The Da Vinci Code is different since it merely claims to be fiction. Yet, because so many readers read it as gospel, someone must answer the mythinformation. That would be Olson and Miesel, who counter the Code point by point, tackling its arguments and factually answering its assumptions. Along the way they reveal the secret facts of history which, as the popularity of the Code shows, really are unknown.	2004-07-23

Tolkien: Myth, Morality and Religion	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Spellbinding and Engaging	It probably doesn't get better than this: the insights of an informed and engaging professor on an endlessly fascinating subject, delivered by a compelling performer. Having said that, audio books take some getting used to, particularly if you're used to reading at your own speed. The risk is greater with fiction readings, which can sound so disastrously different than the book, but the potential is also greater. With a non-fiction reading like this one, it's pretty much just about someone reading a book. That said, what would matter greatly is the book and the someone reading it. This book, reprinted from an earlier edition, is a bestseller for Ignatius Press, and Matthew Arnold's reading is subtle and nuanced. He reads the book's ten chapters on five CDs. At first it seemed he was reading very fast, but by the second chapter my brain had adjusted and settled in. It was like hearing a lecture where for some reason you could hear the professor without the distractions of a lecture hall, and more remarkably, he spoke distinctly and didn't drop his notes. The CDs revealed to me what reading the book did not: this could be a college telecourse (except it's not on TV) because you learn so much listening to it. The production is very clean and sparse except for brief instrumental snippets of Celtic tunes like &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; at the open and close of chapters. Matthew Arnold has also read other audio books for St. Joseph Communications (saintjoe.com), which seems to specialize in Catholic books. This audio book is also available on cassette, and these first editions may be collector's items because Purtill's name is misspelled &quot;Purthill,&quot; which makes it hard to find in search engines. Although this is my first audio book, if others are as good as this one, it won't be my last.	2004-05-04

There are all sorts of generational conflicts and infighting which, combined with superhuman powers makes them both dangerous and incomprehensible to mortals. It is this last sense that provides the underlying suspense in The Kaphtu Trilogy: the gods are finally unpredictable to humans, who must get on as best they can with the unknown always around the corner. Each of the stories are told in the first person by a mortal: Chryseis, a young girl taken prisoner in The Golden Gryphon Feather, Ducalion, a young boy thrust into the adult world in The Stolen Goddess. But the third book is the most ambitious, telling the story of Helen of Troy from four different viewpoints and weaving together characters from the other books as well as mortals, gods and half-gods from ancient myths who people the stories.<br />These new editions are large size (8X5) paperbacks printed on acid-free paper, with beautiful, full-color covers. The first book's cover is from the original art by George Barr that appeared on the DAW books pocket paperback edition in the late '70s. The second and third books both feature original art by Don Maitz, who also did the DAW paperback of The Mirror of Helen in the early '80s. &quot;I enjoyed the opportunity to bring some mythology to light,&quot; Maitz wrote of the project; &quot;thank you for a wonderful reading experience.&quot; I could do no better than to quote a review from F.M. Busby, whose own science fiction Demu Trilogy also deserves to be brought back into print: &quot;With a scholar's grasp of the period and its mythology, and an unerring eye for character, Richard Purtill brings a gripping reality to the seige of Ilium. The Mirror of Helen is as real as today's news--and vastly more enjoyable. This book is a grabber!&quot;njoyable. This book is a grabber!&quot;	2004-04-26

But it used to be called &quot;The Gospel Show.&quot; But it wasn't gospel, it was a show playing &quot;contemporary Christian music,&quot; which you can hear anywhere. When he took over the show, he immediately jacked up the rock content, playing Larry Norman, Vigilantes of Love, Victoria Williams and Bruce Cockburn, thus providing an unimaginable public service to the listening public, since you can't hear those artists anywhere. Imagine the funny joke of hearing Larry Norman on &quot;The Gospel Show&quot; when people turning in probably thought they'd get hymns. The leprecauns must be laughing at that one.<br />So why change the name of the show? It must be because while he could appreciate the edge and intelligence in the music of these artists, he just couldn't buy the faith part. But no, it turns out he's a Presbyterian chaplain. He just found more challenging, edgy and angry lyrics in Radiohead, Nirvana, and Bruce Springsteen than in those other artists. So now it really is a &quot;gospel show,&quot; with these songs as springboards into his radical radio table talk. Only now the unheard, independent voices are once more cancelled out in favor of music you can hear anywhere.<br />Stockman summarily dismisses British singer Cliff Richard, but Richard has already been there with his own BBC &quot;Rock Gospel&quot; show, and complained that Larry Norman was the only artist he could find to connect with. Stockman writes as a fan, and that part is engaging and interesting. But he uses these insights as springboards into a simple gospel that, while obvious to him, is never quite spelled out. This part resembles rough sermon notes that only appear as afterthoughts and asides. He warns he'll be attacking the church (whatever that is) and America (how surprising) and all sorts of social ills. He never explains his reasoning or his positions because, of course, it's all so obvious. Everyone knows the war in Iraq is unnecessary, although for some reason he doesn't also dismiss America's help to Britain in WW II. Everyone knows we all have a god-shaped hole in us, as he points out, St. Augustine said. Except that was said by Pascal. Look how big American companies are ruining the world--except they're owned by bigger European ones. To troubled students he prescribes the soul searching songs of Jackson Browne. What he never makes clear is if he includes Browne's own hard-won insight that they might feel better with fewer drugs and less free love. Whether or not readers agree with his obvious propositions or can untangle his simple gospel, the premise of the book is still valid: books like this could be written on any artist by any fan so engaged, whether Presbyterian chaplain or Tibetan monk.

As this book reveals, it did--at least to McLuhan. In that context, he was not only experimenting in the realm of media, and exploring its effects, but was also in the swirl of events surrounding Vatican II. While his books chronicled the former interest and passion, culminating in the photo-montage collaborations with Quentin Fiore, The Medium is the Massage and War and Peace in the Global Village, almost nothing came to light of the latter involvement. Until now, that is. Included in this volume are four interviews and numerous letters on all things Catholic and all things media, written at a time when the former was in a time of turbulent upturn, and the latter only beginning to be explored. The most interesting essays concern the interaction of the two: the now common complaint that no one in the Church seems to have any understanding of &quot;electric media,&quot; and that some of the modernizing efforts of Vatican II were, in fact, rendering it more, not less, out of step with the times. Priests and nuns were abandoning collars and habits, he noted, just when young people were donning costumes and dressing up.<br />As a convert, McLuhan in some ways held surprisingly traditional Catholic views, and in candid letters he concisely and engagingly explains why. The first essay examines his debt to G.K. Chesterton, a writer who now, fifty years later, is being rediscovered. Some of the ideas in these essays are quizzical, and you can't help pondering them, such as the idea in a piece called &quot;Liturgy and Media,&quot; that North Americans go outside to be alone, and inside for society, but that in Europe, it's the other way around. This book is filled with those sorts of little insights that you find yourself wondering about and debating. There are a couple essays I would have left out--they either seem too far from the topic or too &quot;top shelf&quot; to engage casual readers. Even so, this is one of the most readable and understandable of McLuhan's books. Even decades after he wrote, his ideas jump out of the page and his insights seem crisp and fresh. His solutions too, seem fresh and original, even if untried. For all his relevance in the 'sixties, his ideas may only now be coming into their own, and there may have never been a better time to discover McLuhan.elf wondering about and debating.

More Lafferty is always good, and appearances to the contrary, there is a lot more Lafferty, but you can never find it. Wildside Press has done us all a great service in (re)publishing the most unique sci-fi writer to ever wield a quill, but this book could stand some careful editing. Maybe it has since been edited, though, because my copy doesn't have an intro. by Michael Swanwick. If so, someone please note that in their review. My copy gathers fifteen stories by R.A.L., who seems to have written a million stories, other collections being Ringing Changes, Does Anyone Have Anything Further to Add and Nine Hundred Grandmothers. Lafferty in Orbit is a collection of stories that appeared in Orbit magazine, with an intro. by Damon Knight. My favorite Lafferty novel, Fourth Mansions, is out of print again, I think. But I just found Space Chantey, which ranks up there with Annals of Klepsis, Arrive at Easterwine and Past Master as his best. Not to Mention Camels is also pretty good. From what I've read, some readers liked The Devil is Dead, which was very memorable--hauntingly so--but I have no idea what it was about. Lafferty writes as if under the influence of a strong, vision-inducing drug, but it's more like the reader slips into a trance reading the story, and when you finish the story, you wake up. Lafferty delivers far more than bottom line sci-fi, and a few typos, while distracting, cannot blur his vision.	2004-04-25

I can understand Marshall McLuhan! Don't get me wrong. It's not that I haven't encountered MM before, but understanding him eluded me. I had hoped for more deluxe versions of the Quentin Fiore collaborations: War and Peace in the Global Village and The Medium is the Massage. But instead of timely, interesting photos, David Carson resorts to typography to frame pithy little McLuhan epigrams. Like those other two books, you at least get your shots of MM one line at a time, and some of the lines are very memorable indeed. Yes, I'm convinced Marshall McLuhan was a prophet (small &quot;P&quot; or maybe big &quot;p&quot;), and that everything he said has already happened. We live in a global village full of hot and cool media; the medium is the message. How obvious it all seems. Reading this book is ancient history. It's already happened. I just wish I could understand it better. Don't bother with the DaVinci code. Crack the McLuhan code and we will all know what's going on. This book reinvents &quot;coffee table books&quot;--it's an 8 inch square two inches thick--so it goes well on little coffee tables from Ikea. I see why they didn't use photos--Corbis owns them all, unlike the public domain galleries in the two earlier books cited (which dazzlingly show more than they tell). Someone new to McLuhan, finding Probes on the tiny coffee table, would probably drink it in, like someone quaffing a particularly good drink. But having finished the tumbler, they'd likely wander off to find the hostess and a refill, asking where she learned her mixology. Those reading, or rather encountering, Probes will also be left inquiring about McLuhan, and probing for more understanding.	2004-04-25

I don't know if librarians can continue in this way to suggest reading selections from beyond the grave, but if I were a spirit so inclined, I would bonk people on the head with this book. Why? Because unaided, it has so much against it. Who's Thomas Howard? Why a book about New York? If it's a real book, why doesn't Amazon even have a picture of it? I found it in a bookstore in Pennsylvania by happenstance, but had an unseen benefactor brought it to my attention by shoving it off the shelf, I'd be thanking them now. This ranks with On Being Catholic among Thomas Howard's best books, and it suffers from the same problem: that casual readers may find it difficult going (see my solution to this problem at the end of my Thomas Howard Guide). Apart from that, this collection of essays ranges widely,while yet retaining the Howardian touch. It also manages to bridge between the musings and casual ruminating of his earlier books (like Chance or the Dance) and the insight and excitement in his later books (Charles Williams, Lead Kindly Light, On Being Catholic). In some ways it hearkens back to his delightful column in The New Oxford Review. Lacking the hands-on approach of a literary poltergeist, my persuasive powers are limited to words. But if you like Thomas Howard, don't miss this intriguing and visionary book. Consider yourself bonked.	2004-04-10

Lewis, this book deserves pride of place. Why? Because it came first. Well, not exactly first, but rather early on. Except for updates, this new Ignatius Press edition is an exact reprint of the earlier Harper and Row edition which appeared in hardback and paperback, was used by a bookclub, and then unaccountably went out of print. Ignatius Press, never to be stopped by the unaccountable, brought back Purtill's book on Tolkien last year (now an Ignatius best seller and also available on audio tape), and this year, with little fanfare, quietly slipped out his book on C.S. Lewis. I'll leave it to others to comment on the book and merely mention that in reprinting it, Ignatius Press has released a timebomb, for there is sure to be demand for Dr. Purtill's other related books, Reason to Believe and Lord of the Elves and Eldils (not that Richard Purtill?) not to mention his fantasies based on Greek mythology, The Kaphtu Trilogy, which have also just returned to print (that's the same Richard Purtill?). Search on the web and you find numerous references to his textbooks on logic, philosophy, ethics and religion (he wrote those too?).<br />You could find used copies of his DAW books science fiction novel, The Parallel Man, or his Doubleday sci-fi themed mystery, Murdercon. In fact you'd find references to twenty published books (five of which are currently back in print, with a new novel to appear next year). All from the same prolific professor who wrote short stories in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, was feted as guest of honor at Mythcon, and packed the classroom of his SRO  college class, \\"Fantasy and Philosophy.\\" As reviewers of his books on C.S.

I disagree completely with the negative reviews of this book for the following reasons. First, the authors of those reviews seem to be well-versed in the history of the last 2000 years and object to how Mr. Crocker presents his version. All I can say is they have been lucky not to have had to sit through what passes as history as I have. I have never heard Mr. Crocker's side, even in so-called Catholic books. &quot;A church that never went right would be quite as miraculous as a church that never went wrong,&quot; Chesterton quipped in Orthodoxy. In all the other versions of history I've been exposed to, the church never goes right. Obviously their fairy tales were as flawed as Mr. Crocker's critics feel his presentation to be. Yet even now these inventive revisions top the best seller list. How I pity the innocent readers who, unaware of the marketing ploy foisted on them, may attempt to create a coherent philosophy from the hacked together bits of historical shrapnel that pass for, and are taught as, history. Second, if you wonder why so many people are today reconsidering the Catholic Church, it's because its detractors have overstated their case. It's as if, to quote Chesterton again, &quot;any stick was good enough to beat Christianity with.&quot; All that happens is one loses respect for the beaters and gains respect for the beaten. Chesterton wrote his comments 100 years ago, summarily dismantling the idiotic pre-modern world (back now as the idiotic post-modern world). As a convert, Crocker is naturally excited to tell the other side of the story, and as a hungry soul starved by the meaninglessness of the non-philosophies of today I was excited to read it. One caveat: the time of the Reformation and the Thirty Year war is an account of unbelievable violence and carnage. But as Mel Gibson's movie shows, a great many in our day are hungry for the truth to set us free.	2004-02-23

In this book, eleven Lutherans tell why they took up the offer. This book differs somewhat from the general interest, dumbed-down sort of conversion story. Few of these writers would sum up with the line from &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot; &quot;I once was blind, but now I see.&quot; These stories are far more involved and candid than you would expect. They give interesting insights into the differences and commonalities in the various Lutheran bodies, and the book may be of interest to Catholics wondering how Protestants view their communion. Most of all, however, this book will be of interest to Protestants of various stripes who share a lively interest in spiritual things and will find echoes in these writers' accounts of their own life stories.	2004-02-17

An optimist reading MM may move somewhat the other way. But for those suffering the far more common modern malady of a nearly flatlined brainwave pattern from being inundated by dead prose, a dose of the divine Mr. M. comes as a reviving jolt of the paddles. Intoxicated by that first disorienting rush of life, one may do odd things. I named my website alivingdog.com after reading Malcom's take on a phrase from Ecclesiastes&quot; A living dog is better than a dead lion.&quot; Ian Hunter, having sustained a nearly fatal dose, went on to write Malcom Muggeridge: A Life, and now, the madness not yet abated, to edit 250 pages of pithy quotes and diverting anecdotes in The Very Best of Malcom Muggeridge.<br />Spanning 60 years of writing, these brief excerpts run from a paragraph to a page, and were gathered from newsprint, radio, TV and books. Thirteen chapters provide a rough thematic grouping and a sort of directional arrow cavorting with jaunty energy through the book. Only one caveat colors my wholehearted recommendation of this book; these short snippets may appear as overly brief and telegraphic; some of Muggeridge's more thoughtful bits take pages to get going. Nevertheless, these short bits may serve as springboards for readers into the full-length works, as an apertif whetting the appetite for the full-course meal. Following Ian Hunter's lead, new readers will hopefully press on to track down the books meantioned, the best of which, notably the two-volume Chronicles of Wasted Time, read seamlessly from start to finish.	2004-02-01

Baker Books added the subtitle and dropped the tatoo cover in favor of this more nondescript one for its 2004 printing. But it leads to mix-ups, and in some Amazon ads, they seem to be two different books, even being sold together for a special price. (So get one or the other version, but not both).<br />This book is a follow-up to Mark Joseph's The Rock and Roll Rebellion (which also had a long subtitle), which profiled a number of artists to make the point that they'd be better off staying in the musical mainstream rather than getting shuttled off with the misleading label of &quot;Christian Rock&quot; artists, a nearly universally derided term, or even worse, &quot;Contemporary Christian Musicians&quot; or CCM for short, named, again misleadingly, for a magazine called CCM.<br />That thesis also underscores Mark Allen Powell's Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Christian Music, which is similarly critical of the CCM subculture. The point is more obvious in Powell's original title, Parallel Worlds, A Critical View of Popular Christian Music (which was changed by the publisher to the present title which implies uncritical acceptance of this &quot;parallel world.&quot;<br />Both books share their thesis with another book that wasn't primarily about music at all, Bob Briner's Roaring Lambs. In one way, these three books hook together. Joseph was both inspired and encouraged by Briner, and rather than bemoaning the sad cul de sac in which many artists find themselves, Powell in his book is bringing these artists' achievements out for assessment in the common light of day. Both Joseph and Powell are effectively treading new ground: not only acquainting us with &quot;new&quot; artists and music we may have missed, but at the same time giving us great rock writing.	2004-01-09

Tolkien, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield and Their Friends	Books	5	23	23	N	Y	A Reference Guide for the Rest of Us	Here's a book that at first seems neither fish nor fowl, occupying a no-man's land between the spate of popular Inklings studies and the far more academic guides for the far more serious reader. But extremists tend to push us moderates the other way, and a stridently negative review convinced me this book deserved a closer look. I'd say it's the first book for people in the middle: fascinating at first glance and rewarding when one digs deeper. This is a beautifully made library quality hardback, which gives it a reference book feel, and which yet rewards casual reading. The authors adopt a unique approach, dividing the book into two sections. The first fifty pages consists of six short essays, by which readers may wander into the subject from various avenues of approach. The second section, which occupies the remaining 250 or so pages, consists of alphabetized, encyclopaedic entries on all things Inklings. To further aid the itinerant reader, bits in the essays are starred, indicating an entry in part two. Add in the comprehensive bibliography, and you've got about the most helpful reference book imaginable. This is also one of the few books about C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien which gives anything more than a passing note to Charles Williams and Owen Barfield. As an avid Williams reader, I found not only the relevant passages, but also the essay relating to Williams best poetry, based on the Arthurian legends and the Matter of Britain, fascinating and enlightening. Colin Duriez's latest book is about the friendship between Lewis and Tolkien. In The Inklings Handbook the authors allude to and celebrate the wider, if more varied friendships between the various members of the Inklings--and one more friendship: what Williams would call the \\"confraternity\\" of kindred souls who are the Inklings' readers. It's as if you walked into the Eagle and Child Pub in Oxford. Colin leaning on the bar and David at the dart board, both look up as you walk in, and walk over to shake hands. \\"C'mon,\\" says Colin, pointing to little gathering at a back booth, \\"there's someone here we'd like you to meet.\\"ands. \\"C'mon,\\" says Colin, pointing to little gathering at a back booth, \\"there's someone here we'd like you to meet.\\"	2003-12-02

Lewis and the Catholic Church	Books	5	94	100	N	N	Jack's Journey on the Road to Rome	In picking up a book like this, the most obvious question is \\"why read it?\\" The most obvious answer is given in the title: to explore Lewis's views of, and relation to the Catholic Church. I picked up the book with that idea in mind, but instantly discovered a much wider appeal. More interesting than Pearce's attempt to answer that question are the many byways he treads to get there. What impressed me was his skill as a researcher: in turning over stones to find things others have overlooked, in drawing odd, if plausible parallels between things that seem disconnected, in tracing some of the rich streams that fed Lewis's imagination and flowed into his works. In particular, Pearce looks at The Pilgrim's Regress and The Great Divorce, two widely-read works of fiction, and Mere Christianity, Lewis's most popular nonfiction work. Pearce probes into the \\"troubles\\" of Lewis's native Belfast and the later atmosphere of inquiry and debate at Oxford, following him from an atheist to a convert and well-known Chrstian apologist. Would that road have eventually led to Rome? he asks. Why or why not? One can only speculate, and Pearce imaginatively considers the question. Interestingly, he notes, the Anglicans of Lewis's own denomination less and less read him, while he is becoming more and more popular among two other groups: Catholics and Evangelical Protestants. A Catholic convert himself, Pearce naturally leans towards the former readers, but it would be unfortunate if the latter group missed this book by an author in so many ways in sympathy with them, and which sheds so much light on what both groups find in common in an author they both love.<br /><br />For more on Lewis' relationship to the Catholic Church see my interview with Richard Purtill, author of C.S. Lewis' Case for the Christian Faith (available through Amazon) at Ignatius.com in the Ignatius Insight online magazine.	2003-11-26

(Thank You Regent College)	Malcom Muggeridge is one of the funniest, most insightful and downright stubborn authors of the twentieth century. He was funny in Punch, the British humor magazine, he was funny on the BBC in &quot;That Was the Week That Was,&quot; and even funny in a Monte Python meets real life sort of way when he got kicked off the BBC for alledgedly mocking the Queen. Of course it was all a misunderstanding, like the misunderstanding that got writer P.G.Wodehouse denounced as a traitor for making those wartime broadcasts from Germany. Malcom Muggeridge was the man who straightened that all out and got PGW repatriated, and later PG (Plum) Wodehouse was knighted as one of Britain's best. Surely there were no hard feelings toward Malcom as well.<br />Then Muggeridge did an interview with Mother Teresa for the BBC, and made a series of TV shows called A Third Testament about St. Augustine, Pascal, Tolstoy and other figures who had influenced him. At the same time that priests and bishops in England were leaving orders and losing faith, Muggeridge was somehow finding it. That would have been forgiveable, but he remained subversively funny. The essays collected in The Most of Malcom Muggeridge and Tread Softly For You Tread On My Jokes are side-splittingly funny and rank among the best of Punch's drollery. His two volume autobiography even has a funny title: The Chronicles of Wasted Time. Christ and the Media doesn't have a funny title (which may be why it originally went out of print so soon), but it contains a funny essay called &quot;The Fourth Temptation.&quot; In a humorous role-reversal, journalist Muggeridge is also interviewed by the BBC. His roasts of the media in his many books are so funny that his opponents had no recourse but to put his books out of print. Thanks to Regent College, their little trick didn't work, and this subversive little volume is once again at large. Get it while you can and write your own review.	2003-10-10

If the last will be first, Catherine will be leading the way into heaven. If the greatest are those who make themselves the least, then Catherine is truly great indeed. If angels can fly, as Chesterton quipped, because they take themselves lightly, she must have skipped along two feet off the ground. That's the impression I gained from Eddie Doherty about the Russian countess who turned her back on fortune and fame and embarked instead on a remarkable life of service, sacrifice and incredible adventure.<br />The second thing this bio did was made me want to know more about Eddie, who left behind a career as a hard-boiled newspaper reporter to follow Catherine as a partner in marriage and life, and who later became a priest. He did the screen-writing for a seldom-seen film called The Fighting Sullivans (originally The Sullivans), based on a true story about five brothers who served together and were all killed in war. A note explains that the work of Madonna House, which Catherine and Eddie helped found, goes on today in Canada. A grassroots movement is underway calling for her to be canonized as a saint. Madonna House is also soliciting support to make a movie of Catherine's life, and working to bring her books back into print. Whether or not Catherine is canonized as a saint, she will be nonetheless be recognized as one by readers who encounter her remarkable story, lovingly told by Eddie in Tumbleweed.	2003-09-27

These new large size paperback collector editions feature acid-free paper, an interior illustration, and full color fantasy cover art (see the author's website at alivingdog.com for a comparison of the covers). The cover of The Golden Gryphon Feather (Book One) is by George Barr, who also did the late '70s DAW books edition cover. Don Maitz, whose art adorned the DAW cover of Purtill's The Mirror of Helen, provided original paintings for the covers of both The Mirror of Helen and The Stolen Goddess in these new editions.<br />While this second story continues the adventures of book one, it also stands on its own, and it's not necessary to read the earlier books to follow the trilogy's story line. Purtill sketched the book's setting in ancient Athens and Crete from his many visits to Greece, and fleshed out characters drawn from mythology. Beyond that, his novelization weaves between history and imagination to tell the story of Ducalion, a young seafarer who braves the Hounds of Hades in search of a kidnapped goddess. On the way he encounters Dionysius and Artemis, and finds himself in the midst of a feud between Olympians. The volatile tempers of the Titans alternately swerve between great generosity and cold vengeance, lending an aura of suspense, and the ones Ducalion encounters don't seem to like mortals.<br />You don't need any background in Homeric legends to read the trilogy, but those familiar with ancient tales will find echoes everywhere. Like Homer, Purtill feels at liberty to morph the myths, with gods and half-gods forever emerging from their ancient haunts. While they can be read separately, all three books of the trilogy interact, and a Return to Kaphtu trilogy is  in the works, with a new fantasy, The Athenian Owl Enchantment, due out next year.	2003-09-20

Oddly enough, it's the one many readers have missed because it wasn't reprinted when Eerdmans brought out the various editions of his other half dozen novels. This is thinking man's(or woman's) Goth; there are more ideas in one chapter than in an entire Stephen King novel. Another difference is it's the Good and not evil that is truly terrifying (evil is a shade or shadow of the Good). The occultic plots are somewhat drawn from Williams' involvement in The Order of the Golden Dawn, a secret society headed by A.E.Waite, best known for the Waite Tarot Deck. Its members variously included poet W.B.Yeats (known for his poem, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;) and Evelyn Underhill, author of Mysticism. At one point, Aleister Crowley, the self-styled &quot;Great Beast,&quot; attempted to wrestle control of The Golden Dawn, and one can only speculate what the outcome would have been had the many converts to Crowley's &quot;Magick&quot; have stumbled on Williams' books instead. Instead of &quot;Mr. Crowley,&quot; would Ozzy be singing &quot;Mr. Williams?&quot; Instead of buying Crowley's mansion and opening occult bookstores to propagate his teachings, would Jimmy Page have renovated Williams' tiny flat and opened Golden Dawn branches all over England? Would &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; be about the Web of Souls and Exchange and the Way of Affirmation and vicariously bearing burdens and the Holy Graal and coinherence and all the rest of Williams' dazzling ideas? Who knows? But this reader joins the many who, having encountered Charles Williams, will never be the same.	2003-09-03

But the golf stories rank among his very best, even for someone who doesn't know a bogie from a birdie. &quot;The Coming of Gowf,&quot; &quot;The Purification of Rodney Spelvin,&quot; and most others in this volume fall in the stack I read over and over. Ranging more widely, I find this applies to every sport Plum takes a pen to, from Rugger to Cricket. Another subject he has a sixth sense for is animals. I avoided for a long time the PGW Bestiary, but if the stories of Geofrey the cat (sp.?) or Ukridge and the dogs, or the cats re: Claude and Eustace's initiation, or for that matter, the ubiquitous broken-down steeds that broke gents with sporting blood are always putting a spot on--if these were the only stories Wodehouse ever wrote, those fortunate enough to find them would still be devouring the full repertoire. Fortunately, there seems to be a PGW renaissance, with everything being reprinted (such as this omnibus). So now my &quot;best stories list&quot; runs: Jeeves, Drones, Mulliner, animals, golf, but the list reads just as well from the bottom up.	2003-09-03

In the third heaven are the living unriven truths, climax tranquil in Venus. Merlin and Brisen heard, as in faint beelike humming round the cone's point, the feeling intellect hasten to fasten on the moving earth's hide. In the third heaven the stones of the waste glimmered like summer stars.&quot;  That's the only poetry I can recite and I probably got it wrong. It's from Taliessin Through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, Williams' two cycles of Arthurian poetry (here in one volume). Without reading C.S.Lewis' commentary in Arthurian Torso (also in this volume)I wouldn't know what he meant, but these lines have something most poetry doesn't; they sound like an incantation, pulsing with power and vision. Like everything Williams wrote, they seem to pull you into another place and the walls between the two worlds dissolve. That's the effect of hearing these poems. Understanding them is another matter. Numerous critics have pointed out that they're rather hard to understand; C.S. Lewis penned his significant commentary in an effort to make Williams' last (and unfinished) poems accessible to a wider audience. He brilliantly succeeded both in opening these poems to the reader and showing how they complement Williams' other writings and echo his ideas. Lewis couldn't keep these two cycles from going out of print, but this Eerdmans volume, scarce as it is, gives credence to Williams' self-penned epitaph, &quot;Poet, Under the Mercy.&quot;	2003-09-03

Sayers	If I have a gripe about this book, it's that the cover picture and blurb would be more at home on a tabloid at the checkstand. There's an earlier version of this book with a somewhat better cover. For that matter, these essays are drawn from two collections published in Sayer's day, Unpopular Opinions and another one I forgot. The best essays reappeared some time back in a collection called Christian Letters to a Post-Christian World (I wonder why that title didn't sell?!), and then again in a series by MacMillian called The Whimsical Christian (catch the play on the name of her detective, Lord Peter Wimsey).<br />However you have to get them, try to read the best of these essays, &quot;The Dogma is the Drama&quot; and &quot;And Telling You a Story&quot; among them. The first one relates to her experiences while writing The Man Born to Be King, the first radio drama of the life of Jesus for the BBC. Long before Jesus Christ Superstar and the many movies tackling the subject, she was at the front lines of critical crossfire for updating the gospels to everyday Cockney England (the sort of updating that was common in the Middle Ages in Mystery plays). The second essay tells how she fell under the spell of another British writer, Charles W.S.Williams, and was so inspired by his writings on Dante that she taught herself Italian and translated the three volumes of The Divine Comedy (the third volume, Paradise, being completed by her student, Barbara Reynolds). Other essays touch on her trials as a mystery writer and playright, and the zillion other things she did (that no one seems to know about). Fans of her sleuth, Lord Peter, may enjoy tracking down these witty essays by the divine Dorothy L.	2003-08-14

Gracie Allen of Burns and Allen fame starred in an old black-and-white film based from this book and cast in the Billy Wilder screwball comedy vein. Arguably this book may not top the PGW cannon--nearly everyone would have a Jeeves, Mulliner or Drones book at the pinnacle of great reading--but it does contain some of the most delightful passages in Wodehouse.<br />The movie falls far short of the book simply because it was made when &quot;All Singing, All Dancing&quot;--(and no plot) was considered a good review for a movie. Any number of PGW novels critique and lampoon his experiences in Hollywood, but seeing the film first and then reading the book, one might be pleasantly surprised. For me, this novel holds up as one of the best non-Jeeves stories, others being French Leave and The Girl On the Boat.	2003-08-14

Tolkien: Myth, Morality, and Religion	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Further Up and Further Into Middle Earth	Before the outstanding films of The Lord of the Rings, readers stumbling across The Hobbit or the trilogy (actually six books in three volumes), came away dazzled, but often with questions. Who was or is J.R.R.Tolkien? Where did these books come from? Why are they so wildly popular? When they first appeared, The Hobbit and the subsequent books were panned by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, but then among the youth they suddenly caught fire. Fifty years later, the films top critics' lists.<br />But why did the Ballantine paperbacks have a note on the back from Tolkien urging readers to buy the authorized editions (were there bootlegs floating around?). Why did another English professor, C.S.Lewis, devote the preface of his science-fiction novel, Out of the Silent Planet to gaining support for Tolkien's not yet published epic, The Lord of the Rings?<br />In one of the earliest books on Tolkien's novels, Dr. Richard Purtill, a philosophy professor at Western Washington University, addressed these and other questions. As an author, Dr. Purtill ranged widely, writing textbooks, philosophy books on logic, ethics and religion on the one hand, and fantasy novels, science-fiction and mysteries on the other. For years he taught a popular class on Philosophy and Fantasy; this book, originally published in hardback by Harper and Row in the mid '80s, both follows from and expands on that series.<br />This book starts in what may seem an odd place, with a discussion of a short story by Tolkien called &quot;Leaf By Niggle.&quot; Many addicts of The Lord of the Rings, however, are not even aware the story exists, and with good reason. Originally published as half of a slim hardback called &quot;Tree and Leaf,&quot; it now appears in a small paperback called The Tolkien Reader. The other half of &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot; is a famous essay called &quot;On Fairy Stories,&quot; which gives Tolkien's views of literature and its connection to life. It's one of the very few places he gives his spiritual views or refers to his faith as a Catholic. Yet, as avid readers of C.S.Lewis know, Lewis was an atheist before talks with Tolkien led to his conversion. Purtill gives three possible interpretations of &quot;Leaf By Niggle&quot; (without ruining the story), and touches lightly on Tolkien's views in &quot;On Fairy Stories.&quot;<br />The rest of these brief essays explore various topics in Tolkienana, such as the real heroes in The Lord of the Rings (this heroism is greatly attractive in the movies), and a topic he often discusses at fantasy conventions: myth, fantasy and science-fiction in The Lord of the Rings.

Should that happy event occur, you may end up as puzzled as I am that most of Malcom Muggeridge is out of print. A Third Testament, for instance was the accompanying book for a series of films/TV shows written and narrated by Mr. M.M.. You'd think since Little, Brown published the book, and it was owned by Time-Life, which also owned the shows, that ads would be popping up on late night TV for the whole Time-Life Muggeridge collection. Think again. Or you'd think that since Collins Books (now part of HarperCollins) brought out the two volumes of his autobiography, The Chronicles of Wasted Time, to rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic, that someone might trouble to keep them in print. Think again again.<br />The reason must be that the author's life was too dull, his writing style too lifeless and dry, his testament (whatever that is) prescribed bedtime reading for insomniacs. His titles notably absent from the bestseller list, he would understandably not be a household name. One wouldn't recognize him as a former editor of the British humour magazine, Punch, or as a player on the BBC's send-up of the news, That Was the Week That Was. But that would explain why his books are so side-splittingly funny. One also wouldn't know that he did the first BBC interview with Mother Teresa, and was profoundly moved by her life, an inspiration evident in A Third Testament. That would explain why his books are so profound. Nor would one know of the awakening in his soul that led him to tirelessly denounce the idiocy of modern life even as Malcom and his wife, Kitty, simplified their own lives to follow a different drummer. That would explain why this book by a late convert to the Catholic Church was reprinted by Plough Publishing and praised by readers of all spiritual stripes. But nothing can explain why these Muggeridge books are all out of print, or keep readers who have tasted one from tracking down them all.down them all.	2003-06-03

We all know that writers in library journals have axes to grind since a good review guarantees that most libraries will stock the book. Look at the [books] in libraries these days (and pity kids looking for something to read) and you'll see my point. The fact that some knucklehead didn't like this book wouldn't normally have swayed me, but like many detractors she went too far, and described it in order to slam it. Just her description of the story, which she found \\"far-fetched,\\" convinced me of two things: she had no imagination, and this sounded like a great book. No, I'm not being fair to the reviewer, who perhaps simply had no taste for L'Engle's brand of fantasy, but man, did she make me want to read this book.<br />Like many L'Engle books this one starts slow. Not put-the-book down slow but unpretentious, unassuming, making no attempt to hide the narration. No plunging into the plot, nothing blowing up, not at all Hollywood. Almost too obvious to keep reading. Almost. Almost too simple and kid-level. Almost. But a couple pages in and I couldn't put it down. An Acceptable Time ranks as one of my all-time great reading experiences, hot on the heels of L'Engle's amazing, awe-inspiring Many Waters. The sad thing is that Many Waters features as the fourth book of the Time Quartet, but no one knows that An Acceptable Time is the fifth. Take hope oh forlorn reader--you who have finished Many Waters and long for more L'Engle--another reading experience of great power and wonder yet awaits you.	2003-05-19

It's a pity, because as with the Latin Mass, if we only knew what we were missing we would clamor for more. Thankfully Ignatius Press has reprinted this book by Thomas Howard so that we do have a guide through this marvelous world. In this book, originally published by Oxford Press, Thomas Howard starts with the party line that Williams is a bad writer, and then shows us why he's a very good one (Thomas Howard can be very sneaky). He explains why CW can't be considered a \\"major\\" writer, and maybe not even a good candidate for a minor one, but by the end of the book one is convinced that the label \\"major\\" is too small to fit Charles Williams.<br />Howard is similarly dismissive of his own writing in this book, even though it stands as one of his best (his best to date, in my opinion, is On Being Catholic). He suggests the reader not even read the whole book, but just jump around to the relevant parts for the Williams novel he/she is interested in. Here again I must express a minority opinion: The Novels of Charles Williams reads seamlessly and grippingly start to finish.<br />Anyone venturing into a Williams novel for the first time might find the water, as it were, initially cold and uninviting, regardless how heartily the swimmers urge him or her to dive in. Howard is like a personal trainer, both preparing the reader and helping them stay in shape when, gripped with the strange madness that afflicts readers of Williams novels, they recklessly swim further and further from shore. Howard is obviously among the initiates, and the more dismissive he is of Willaims' standing as a writer, the more you want to read him. 'Nuff said. Dive in. The water's fine.	2003-05-10

Nevertheless, Charles Williams is my favorite writer, and War in Heaven my favorite of his books. Let me proceed to explain why.<br />CW's poetry may miss the mark of some poetic standard, but even now I can recite pieces from Taliessin Through Logres, while I usually find modern poetry uninspiring. His plays may not hold up well in some conventional sense of what plays are supposed to be, but they contain some of the most quotable lines I've ever read, and I would drive to the next state to see one put on. His novels may be dismissed as dense and obscure, but they are among the most gripping books I've ever read. War in Heaven isn't his best novel--that would be All Hallows Eve-- yet it's my favorite. I'm finally up to the point of saying why.<br />Some college lit classes read Descent into Hell because it takes place on a number of well-defined levels. War in Heaven has wheels within wheels as well, but they aren't so clearly defined. It's not quite his easiest to read novel--that would be Many Dimensions--but it's still one of the easiest. Of all his novels, War in Heaven perhaps falls over into the most categories--it's a supernatural thriller that is sort of a detective novel, kind of a suspense novel, in a way about relationships, about self-growth, spiritual search and discovery, but not in a traditional sense.<br />Everything that conventional novels are supposed to be these novels are not, which is why people like me who have no desire to read the bestsellers at the supermarket checkout stand yet find themselves taken with Williams' novels. One popular book report topic in college lit classes is to show how the characters &quot;grow&quot; through the book. With War in Heaven I found this difficult to do because reading a Williams book, it seems it's more like the reader who grows. Although the little group who throw in their lot with the Archdeacon in War in Heaven come to live by a typically Williams-esque maxim, &quot;Believe and doubt well,&quot; the book seems to end where it began, yet somehow everything is new.grows.

Not knowing or understanding much of Dante, I can nevertheless not forget what Charles Williams wrote about him, as about the above quotation from The Divine Comedy. Dante's heaven-sent guide announces &quot;we are,&quot; not &quot;I am Beatrice,&quot; speaking in unity with the Cloud of Witnesses, the testimony of the saints and out of the relationship of the divine life which is realized in heaven.<br />But Williams could almost say &quot;We are Charles Williams,&quot; because he somehow seems to be such a kindred soul with Dante, and so attuned to the poet's thought that the effect of hearing or reading him on Dante was and is magnetic--so much so that Dorothy L. Sayers taught herself Italian and translated Dante's Divine Comedy in three volumes for Penguin Books (the Paradiso was completed by her student, Barbara Reynolds). Sayers dedicated her translations to &quot;Charles Williams, The Master of the Ways.&quot; The Ways referred to are the way of rejection and the way of affirmation, two sorts of spiritual paths explained in this, and many other Williams volumes.<br />But she was not the only one to so lionize CW. C.S.Lewis wrote similarly in his Preface to Paradise Lost that Williams had revolutionized Milton criticism. Apparently the door was unlocked all the time, Lewis wryly notes, but only you (CW) thought of trying the handle. Who else did this supposedly obscure and unremarkable British writer influence? How about Canadian poet and singer Bruce Cockburn in his albums Dancing in the Dragon Jaws and Humans (the latter often considered one of his best albums)?<br />If Charles Williams did have a fault as a writer, it was that he tended to write too telegraphically, almost in a kind of shorthand, assuming his readers were with him when some of them, at least, would be lost. This happens in The Forgiveness of Sins, which assumes a good grasp of Shakespeare, and He Came Down From Heaven, which assumes a good grasp on everything else. Some of his essays do this also, particularly his book reviews, which assume that in reading the review one has also read the book. His reviews of some writers, however, such as D.H. Lawrence, and for that matter, St. Augustine, are so lively and unforgettable that they have long outlived their time. Of his nonfiction works, The Descent of the Dove (subtitled a History of the Holy Spirit in the Church) and The Figure of Beatrice flow the best and assume the least. Oddly enough, you can read the latter knowing nothing about Dante and the former knowing nothing about the Holy Spirit and learn a lot about both. Better yet, you learn a lot about Williams. Once one has met him, his trademark style is unmistakeable and for readers like me who have fallen under his spell, greatly compelling. There is no other writer like Charles WIlliams and no better place to meet him than in The Figure of Beatrice.everything else.

The Golden Gryphon Feather originally appeared in the late '70s in the famed DAW science-fiction gold-spined pulp paperback editions. The coarse pulp pages, internal drawings, heroic cover art and cover blurbs were all hallmarks of fantasy of the time that DAW publisher Donald A. Wolheim, formerly of ACE Books, rendered classic and distinctive. Two more fantasies by Richard Purtill followed in DAW editions, creating in retrospect, the Kaphtu Trilogy. After some two decades, the trilogy is back again, this time on acid-free paper and in quality large size trade editions, with beautiful full-color covers by the original artists. (For a comparison of the editions, see the author's website at alivingdog.com). Yet while two of Purtill's books on fantasy and philosophy have returned to print and are selling briskly, his Kaphtu Trilogy is less well known.<br />The Golden Gryphon Feather is told from the perspective of Chryseis, a young girl in ancient Crete who is taken prisoner to the legendary Isle of Kaphtu. There she becomes a bull leaper in a world where nothing is as it seems; gods, half-gods and mortals form uneasy liasons, titanic forces keep the island in upheaval, shadowy figures and whispered plots lend the palace an air of intrigue. And what has become of her mother, who has disappeared, leaving only a talisman for a clue? Purtill writes his stories on many levels, so that while the trilogy requires no knowledge of Greek mythology, those up on ancient myths will take secret pleasure in finding characters and resonances throughout the books. In her introduction to the late '70s DAW books pocket paperback edition, fantasy author C.J. Cherryh wrote: \\"It's a book I wish I had written. It has magic; there are gods and mortals, and the kind of golden haze about it all which belongs to that age.\\" Fans of the Kaphtu Trilogy will rejoice to return to the Bright Land with these new editions.	2003-05-09

Chesterton:  Apostle of Common Sense	Books	5	73	74	N	N	GKC Once Over Lightly	&quot;Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly,&quot; G.K.Chesterton once remarked. Despite his considerable poundage, no one took himself more lightly than GKC. In this tiny tome, Dale Ahlquist, president of the American Chesterton Society, takes on a big subject--the 300 pound Victorian writer G.K.C.. Daunting as the task may be, he succeeds in giving a birds' eye view--Peter Pan style--flying as it were over twelve of the prolific author's best-known and most-loved books, lighting here and there to briefly explore historical and cultural connections.<br />Ahlquist in person takes himself as lightly as GKC, as anyone who has heard his lectures can attest, but here he comes off as earnest, at times even strident, as against the buoyant wit of his subject. The reason is that he has simply given Chesterton all the good lines, and been content to play straight man to his humorous star. He further straight-jackets himself by confining himself to GKC's nonfiction work, and we all know how many funny lines are scattered throughout the fiction.<br />No matter. Chesterton emerges as firmly on the side of the angels, applying, impossible as it may sound, the same light touch and genial sensibility to the pressing problems of our times--or rather his times nearly 100 years ago. All in all, here's the best intro to not only the man Chesterton, but a dozen of his best books.	2003-04-27

It's so fresh you can smell the ink in your nostrils. It's so vibrant you can easily forget it's the N.T. and then forget to put it down. It's so gripping that instead of  dreading the daily dose of a couple of verses, you look forward to overloading on your next fix. At least I do, and that's after reading countless translations, studying all sorts of helpful guide books, and knowing the Sunday School stories front to back.<br />But Lattimore's translation is different. He's a Greek translator not a theologian, concerned not so much with making the text say something in English, as with letting it live. And stripped of adornment, the Word is pulse-pounding, heart-racing, blood- pumping alive. \\"Wait a minute,\\" someone may say, \\"Are we talking about the Bible?\\" Yes, we are. But reading Lattimore's version, one sees why people think the story is so exciting.<br />The genius of this book is in what it leaves out. So not the stately King James. Nor the Not-so-New International Version.  No chapter or verse numbers. The four Gospels sound like stories, and the letters of St. Paul read like letters. Lattimore's other genius is his uncanny ear; he often uses simpler words than other translations, but sometimes he chooses bigger ones. Some parts flow together connecting half-remembered tales into a larger narrative, but others are told at a breathless pace: \\"we did this, and then we did that and then this happened, and then some other thing occured.\\" This is exactly how someone, face to face, would relay a story.<br />In the preface Lattimore modestly says, \\"I was struck by the natural ease with which Revelation turned itself into English.\\" I am struck with how he turned it into great reading.	2002-11-18

Except for a few cartoons, I veer between Cartoon Network and Nick, not stopping at the Disney Channel. A big exception, though,was A Ring of Endless Light, a recent Disney Channel TV movie. Given that the books are always better, in my opinion, this film compares favorably with the book. It's enjoyable to see the dolphin sequences \\"come to life,\\" as it were, after their vivid portrayl in the story.<br />Like many readers, I came to L'Engle through the \\"increasingly inaccurately titled\\" Time Trilogy (now up to five books). I was amazed at how her story-telling skill transferred effortlessly from the O'Keefes to the Austins, even without tesseracts, Proginoskes and kything.<br />Having said that, I think that L'Engle is one of the most delightful authors to read. Her writing is deceptively simple, but every page something new subtley draws you in. Somehow she also seems to understand adolescence. She doesn't write down to teens or fob off some contrived formula (as a great many recent films seem to do); maybe her inner teen is writing these books.I'm likely not the only one who'd like to see L'Engle's books get the Harry Potter treatment on the big screen, but this Disney Channel movie is certainly a good start.	2002-11-18

At first glance those titles may seem to have nothing in common, but they both exult in, to quote the Iggy Pop song, lust for life.<br /><br />I'd never heard of this novel until I was reading a book by Os Guiness in which he started telling an exciting story that I couldn't put down. Then he suddenly dropped off and said he'd been paraphrasing a part from Manalive. So naturally I had to read the novel. If it is a novel.<br /><br />In his 1936 autobiography Chesterton writes, \\"I could not be a novelist; because I really like to see ideas or notions wrestling naked, as it were, and not dressed up in a masquerade as men and women.\\" (p. 282, Ignatius). In that regard, this story has nothing in common with what the novel had come to mean in Victorian times (which Chesterton disliked).<br /><br />GKC did like certain Victorian conventions that were everywhere being dismissed and downplayed, namely melodrama and fairy tales. Since he called himself a journalist, this book first appeared as a serial in a newspaper, and as such is replete with \\"cliff-hanger\\" endings all through it of the sort usual in melodrama and which also proved convenient for the paper.<br /><br />This story has what I consider about the best written first page in English, after which it turns into a very different story. It illustrates two of Chesterton's favorite topics: gratitude, which along with the family he called the two \\"Jewish virtues\\" and surprise. Reading his autobiography, these ideas increasingly underscored nearly everything he did. The surprise comes not only in the unveiling of the story, but also in turning the convention of the Victorian \\"slice of life\\" novel on its ear.<br /><br />Anyone who's read any George MacDonald will find certain similarities in the writing style and a similar exultation that things are not always what they seem. One thinks of the MacDonald story in which a \\"wise woman\\" is accused of being in league with dark forces. MacDonald's \\"detective\\" proves her innocence while exposing her rumour-mongering neighbors.<br /><br />Chesterton deliberately reinforces the stereotypes of his age at the outset in order to destroy them later on. This was what made his Father Brown stories so surprising. He made Father Brown blend into the background so it is almost the background as a character that solves the crimes. Father Brown, as Innocent Smith in this novel, almost represents the animating spirit of life itself, who by shock and surprise can unveil a new world and bring man alive.n\\" is accused of being in league with dark forces.

Sam Phillips? Mortal? Deliverance? P.O.D.? MXPX? Yup. They're all here. Powell's original title was much more telling: \\"Parallel Universe: A Critical Guide to Popular Christian Music.\\"<br /><br />Powell is nothing if not critical. \\"Opinionated\\" was the word the store clerk used. So are all the great rock writers; so are all the great rock books, and despite its encyclopedic format, this is a great rock book. Surprisingly, the author is Professor of New Testament at Trinity Lutheran Seminary; not surprisingly, therefore, he argues with the theology in some songs. For instance, he doesn't agree with the idea of \\"the rapture\\" popularized by Hal Lindsey's book, The Late Great Planet Earth, and the \\"Left Behind\\" series, and prevalent in numerous Jesus Movement-era songs. Most significantly, he takes these artists and their music seriously. This gives the whole genre of gospel rock more signficance than it is often felt to warrant, and certainly more than the tag \\"ccm\\" suggests.<br /><br />If rock rings true, it's because it's about real life. CCM, on the other hand, often sounds phony, stressing the ideal over the real, and marketing over the music. This has left many artists confused, angry and disenchanted. Powell deftly captures the undercurrent of alienation, and the love/hate relationships many artists have with their labels. He also graphs the rise of independent labels like Tooth'n'Nail, and the backlash against business-as-usual \\"corporate rock.\\" The result is that many artists emerge as \\"survivors\\"--ground up and spit out of the music machine, but still standing; Powell's underlying conviction is that it doesn't have to be that way.<br /><br />Accordingly, he doesn't sidestep the divorces and drugs, lies and lawsuits that attend real history; rather than tarnish these artists, the effect is to increase their street credibility: they emerge as real people instead of cardboard cutouts. By even greater magic of his pen, Powell makes us see all that out-of-print vinyl as a significant part of music history--far too important to relegate to the dustbin of \\"cookie-cutter\\" ccm.<br /><br />Some of the short entries are too short, and many are incomplete, understandable given the mammoth scope of the project. Powell wisely chose to include brief entries when information was unavailable, rather than leave artists out. Some of the long pieces, however, are truly outstanding; the ten page Bob Dylan bio ranks among the best bits on that artist I have read. Again and again I looked up obscure artists I was sure would not be among those present: Larry Norman; After the Fire; Malcom and Alwyn; the Lead; Andy Pratt; Robin Lane; Cliff Richard--each time I was amazed to find that Powell had already been there and done that.<br /><br />The hefty retail price tag may have kept the ECCM off most fan's light reading list, but Amazon's low price makes it a great gift for music lovers. Powell includes a searchable CD Rom disc and websites for bands to pump up the value, and at 1,088 pages, it's really more reading than three Harry Potter books. Professor Powell has done music fans a great service with this ground- breaking book, unearthing more than forty years of virtually unknown history--yet for all that, it's a very enjoyable read.bility: they emerge as real people instead of cardboard cutouts.

It happens to be my favorite novel by him, but I was quite surprised that this nearly unknown book would be so good. My suggestion is don't read Martin Gardner's foreword first--read it as a backword, after the book, and then see if you agree.<br /><br />I am editing this review because Amazon won't let me review the book again. The Martin Gardner introduction is in the Dover edition [[ASIN:0486288056 The Ball and the Cross]]. There is a new, 2015 illustrated edition from Chesterton Press which is slightly abridged (very slightly from what I can tell), and has black and white full page illustrations by Ben Hatke in each chapter, along with little Chesterton-like sketches at the ends of the chapters. It's a 9 X 6 inch paperback with larger print and more white space. The blurb on the back cover calls The Ball and the Cross a 1909 \\"Steampunk novel\\", which is the same sense I had when I read it (and recently reread it). [[ASIN:0989941140 The Ball and the Cross]]. It's frankly dazzling. If you plan to read the physical book, these are the two editions I would recommend.<br /><br />Chesterton later wrote a little poem about how he didn't like this book, and how it didn't make any sense, but I found it to be the clearest thing I've ever read, and it has forever instilled lucid pictures in my brain. It starts with a scene that seems to be some sort of dizzying science-fiction story from Victorian England--sort of like something Jules Verne would write if he suddenly became a better writer.<br /><br />That's not the only unforgettable visual image in this book, which is pieced together like so many cliff-hanger serials. Someone else will likely write about all the debates over points of view implicit in the title and fiercely held by the characters, but what attracts me is the excitement of a wildly heroic life (which both characters live). GK shows, of course, that it's found in the romance of orthodoxy, but by the time the book winds up, he has me panting like a thirsty hart to find those cooling streams.<br /><br />Another novel that does this is Manalive!, which a friend of mine said is her second favorite book, next to C.S.Lewis' Perelandra. Manalive! is very light, but it just flies, and opens with the most intriguing first page I've ever read. Both these stories, although written in different ways, seem modern or even post-modern. They seem like they were translated into modern English from another language, even though they both date from the early 20th Century.<br /><br />Recently, I had the chance to see the world premiere of a play of The Man Who Was Thursday, which put these three novels into perspective for me. Chesterton wrote at a time when anarchist dynamiters --the terrorists of their day--were causing havoc about London. Many social conditions were chaotic and in the world of ideas, things were up for grabs.<br /><br />Chesterton did not have an easy conversion, nor did he come by his views without a hard-won struggle. In this sense, he didn't arrive at the \\"right\\" answer by working a puzzle or stumbling on the secret to life, but like his story about a man who walked around the world, came back with a new perspective, able to see things in a new way for the first time. Although I did come to embrace his romantic orthodoxy, I don't think his big gift is in convincing us of the wisdom of the Creed, but rather in opening our eyes to the wonder around us.thodoxy, but by the time the book winds up, he has me panting like a thirsty hart to find those cooling streams.

Despite his being a prolific and engaging writer, Howard's books have only shown up willy nilly, here and there throughout the years. Students may have taken his classes at Gordon College or St. John's Seminary. He wrote an entertaining column in the New Oxford Review when that was still an Episcopalian journal. His biography, Christ the Tiger, and a beautifully written apologetics book, Chance or the Dance, went in and out of print in various editions. He gave seminars at the C.S.Lewis Institute held at Seattle Pacific University, and wrote a wonderful book on the novels of Charles Williams, published by Oxford University Press.<br />That doesn't exhaust where you may have come across Thomas Howard, but those are a few places I ran into him. He described himself once in the New Oxford Review as sitting on a cliff overlooking Rome, dangling his legs off the end, and wondering how long it would be until he jumped. As it turned out, not only Howard, but editor Dale Vree, and everyone else associated with that publication jumped--with the magazine shifting from lively Episcopalian discussions to lively Catholic ones. Eventually I followed Howard and another favorite writer, Malcom Muggeridge, and jumped off myself.<br />Fortunately, my sponsor gave me this book as a confirmation gift. I say fortunately, because Howard describes a worst-case church service of the sort I experienced as a new convert in a new church. If not for this book, I would never have gone back, and never found the sort of joy and belonging that follows the awkwardness and discomfort of exploring something new.<br />I gave this book to an Evangelical friend (who did not also jump off the cliff), and he said it was one of the best books he had ever read, and that it makes you excited about your own church, whatever communion you are in. I think this is Howard's gift. A great many people try to live as believers apart from joining any church (at least I did). Howard simply points out the benefits of the latter course. I think the title of the book is unfortunate, as this is really a book for everyone. Curious Protestants may read it to find out what is going on in the puzzling world of the Catholics, but Catholics will be equally enlightened about the diverse practices of Protestants. Howard comes from an Evangelical missionary background, and he is deeply thankful for and respectful of that heritage.<br />Howard writes two sorts of books--light, breezy ones and thoughtful ones with big vocabularies. Arguably, this book falls into the latter camp, although it is so beautifully written and wonderfully engaging that I'd suggest reading it with a dictionary rather than pass up the pleasure. A Catholic friend of mine preferred his easier book, If Your Mind Wanders at Mass, which covers some of the same ideas.<br /><br />On Being Catholic works out some of the same themes as Evangelical is Not Enough, while yet rejoicing in things Evangelical. Howard wrote a lively article called 'Catholic is Not Enough\\" for the Catholic magazine, Envoy (posted at envoymagazine.com) celebrating what believers have in common. On Being Catholic isn't only about Howard's experiences in the Roman Communion; it's also about the universal (the original meaning of \\"catholic\\") faith expressed in the Creed. In that sense, On Being Catholic is, like C.S.Lewis' Mere Christianity, a book for everyone. \\"All our quarrels are lovers' quarrels,\\" Bishop Fulton Sheen once said of Catholic-Protestant debates.

It's not a profound, brain-frying novel like Fourth Mansions, but it's not as airily light as The Reefs of Earth. It doesn't bog down like his most unreadable books--number one being Apocalypses, or stall in spots like The Devil is Dead. It doesn't crumble under the weight of some big idea, as do some of the short stories. It differs from obvious horror books in not relying on shock value,and from obvious sci-fi in not relying on neat plot tie-ups.<br />It's Lafferty's most visual book, which is to say it conjures up unforgettable pictures. I wish this had been the beginning of a trilogy, because the book drops off right when it gets going. Some of Lafferty's books end up in a very satisfying way, like Fourth Mansions, or Past Master. This book opens up at the climax more than it ends. Like the Star Wars films, you wait for the next one--only there aren't any more. <br />The idea of this book, of pirates who leap through space to plunder worlds, is strong and substantial, and the lightly comic tone seems made for movies or video games or some larger realm than just one book. Maybe some other writer can take up with Lafferty's characters and worlds, as with the novels based on Isaac Asimov's robots--with, of course, a suitable deal cut with Lafferty's estate. It's odd that Lafferty is such an untapped source, because he's simply a better writer than most of those behind films and TV today.<br />This is an easy going science fiction yarn that you don't have to be a Lafferterian to devour. But it's better than some of the Keith Laumer and even Phillip Dick I've read, even though those were all pretty good. Lafferty's strong suite is story; but he also evokes some very visual settings; I can't watch Disney's Treasure Planet--Treasure Island in space--without wishing it were Annals of Klepsis.	2002-10-19
US	51096197	R1Y4BNICHPJELD	1569715769	327725773	Blast Off! Rockets, Robots, Ray Guns, and Rarities from the Golden Age of Space Toys	Books	5	16	16	N	N	This Book Has it All	Blast Off! does what other collector's books only pretend to do. Collector books usually center around value guides, and pass themselves off as glorified shopping lists for toy shows and antique malls. Other books forego any knowledge of the subject whatsoever, and go with photographic essays of the nostalgia craze. A third sort of book tells long stories about growing up in some bygone era. All three sorts of books have, understandably a small readership and limited popular appeal.<br />The authors of Blast Off!, on the other hand, did the hard work of writing a real book, somehow combining it with the best photos and graphics I've seen in a collector's book, and sprinkling in enough anecdotes and oral histories to keep it interesting. This book is a major effort from an accomplished team: a knowledgeable collector, a lively writer, and an avid fan and history buff--the last being Mike Richardson, publisher of Dark Horse comics and owner of the Things from Another World sci-fi comic shops.<br />Blast Off! launches itself as an overview/ intro to the golden age of space toys, but its appeal is really wider than that. This is  a book collectors will want, not simply to locate market values for haggling at the junk shop, but to remind them what they like about their hobby. Beautiful and imaginative graphics evoke the promise and wonder of the space age, but the book is so lively and informative I had to read it twice: once to read the captions and look at the pictures, and again just enjoying the text.<br />It's impossible to overstate how great this book is. The photographs are incredibly clear and bright, and the subject matter is drawn from endlessly rich collections. Books like this tend to fall through the cracks--not really appealing to the general reader, and yet not in-depth enough for the collector. But a reader from the first category who casually glances at this book may find a new interest, and seasoned collectors may find rarities they didn't know existed. Every era has volumes that define it; for the space age, that would be Blast Off!. Every era has volumes that define it; for the space age, that would be Blast Off!	2002-10-19

US	51096197	R3OUBZZD0AJXHU	0152020683	28356414	Half Magic	Books	5	27	29	N	Y	Better By Half	So this is what Dr. Eager did in his spare time. If Half Magic is indicative of his bedside manner, he must have been a very good doctor indeed. For this is one of those sleepy time read-in-bed books like the Chronicles of Narnia, that gently draw you into their fantastic world at that drowsy time when good things seem so much more possible and you're about to drift off into the Land of Nod.<br />Half Magic is written in that wonderful, light, easy 'fifties style that gets so easily overlooked in favor of more extreme excitements. Later discovered, though, one simply wonders how writing could have ever been this good. A wonderfully understated example is shown in the genial attitude of the good samaritan stranger who helps out the young adventurers. He's first respectful of their mother,then falls more and more in love as the book goes on. This undercurrent is so subdued and tasteful that it's barely noticeable amid the magical misadventures until the conclusion of the book.<br />The Leave it to Beaver approach to problem solving is also delighfully refreshing--the spells only half work; unlike the obvious fantasy formulae in countless later books and movies, the magic leaves plenty of room for human ingenuity and skill,as well as the need to make decisions. Eager's other great fantasy, Knight's Castle, also continues in this vein, the hyjinks and hilarity deriving from,and always affirming,the human.	2002-10-18

The large-sized, hardback coffee table book edition consists almost entirely of gorgeous, color photographs of toys from the past, which are visually interesting and require little comment. What comment there is, however, is sometimes wrong. That's not a big downside, because toy hobbyists don't read Kitahara so much to learn about their hobby, as to gaze at the wonderful treasures in his collection.<br />This book is compiled from three previous Kitahara books covering, respectively, \\"dolls, clowns and animals\\"; \\"planes, trains, boats and cars\\";\\" and \\"robots, spaceships and monsters.\\" Someone interested in one of those categories isn't necessarily interested in all three. I, for one, find myself mostly drawn to the third category of robots and spaceships.<br />Other visually lavish and not-too expensive books in that category include \\"Vintage Toys: Robots and Space Toys\\" by Bunte, Hallman and Mueller. \\"Marx Toys: Robots, Space, Comic, Disney and TV Characters\\" by Maxine Pinksy includes lots of old robots because many of them were imported through Marx or its subsidiaries. \\"Baby Boomer Toys and Collectibles\\" by Carol Turpen is also fascinating in this regard. One recent book I very much like is \\"Space Toys of the '60s,\\" by James Gillam, which concentrates exclusively on three toy lines: Zeroid robots from Ideal, Mattel's Major Matt Mason, and Colorforms' Outer Space Men. Along with many color and black and white photos, this inexpensive oversize paperback provides a fascinating history and personal discussion of these toy lines.<br />\\"Toys of the 'Sixties\\" by Bill Bruegman is slighty harder to find, but this large paperback by the editor of \\"Toy Scouts\\" is filled with fascinating behind-the-scenes stories from the history of toys, and chock-full of black and white drawings and pictures. Finally, \\"Boy's Toys of the Fifties and Sixties\\" and its companion volume, \\"Girl's Toys...\\" is a fascinating collection of actual pages from the Sears Christmas Wishbooks from 1950-1969 (something everyone wishes they had kept). Those enchanted by the visual feast of Kitahara's book might want to peruse further in some of these other inexpensive volumes.\\"Girl's Toys...\\" is a fascinating collection of actual pages from the Sears Christmas Wishbooks from 1950-1969 (something everyone wishes they had kept).

So much so, that the book and the film may not have the same audience. Then again, those taken with the  movie will likely want to explore the brief (80 page) book. This recent  paperback edition features a beautiful cover drawn from the Warner Bros.  movie, although the story is Hughes' original. Priced far below the lavish  library volumes, this edition may be the best of both worlds, providing a  look at the film's inspiration for the Iron Giant's many curious fans.	1999-10-04

This brief (159 page)oversize intro in the Thames and Hudson Literary Lives series is drenched in  beautiful b&amp;w illustrations and peppered with lively prose. The best  part, though, is the brief bibliography, which enables one to wade through  the various editions and cross reference English and American titles, so  you don't buy the same book under two different names. Rather than bog down  his biography, Connolly has kept just the good bits in this once over  lightly tour of PGW's life and letters, which surely numbers among the best  of the books on PGW.	1999-10-04

One of the quirkiest science fiction novels ever written, Fourth Mansions reveals Lafferty's story-telling prowess in novel-length form. This is the timeless tale of reporter Freddy Foley, in a way a strange sort of  Everyman, on the trail of things that ought not to be known. And they will  not be known if a shadowy group called the Returnees have their way.  Foley's misadventures lead him to a tangled web of bored suburbanites who  concoct a mindweave to snare unsupecting souls. When the weave takes on a  life of its own, demanding ever bloodier sacrifice, Foley is drawn toward a  meeting with destiny that will take him into the secret world of the  Returnees. Along with Past Master, Arrive at Easterwine, and Annals of  Klepsis, I rate this book among Lafferty's best, and reread it often to  remind myself that no matter how odd the world gets, it doesn't get odder  than Lafferty.	1999-09-28

I came upon PGW in no systematic way, and my favorites by him may be those most easily accessible: Jeeves and Wooster, the Drones Club, the golf stories, the Mr. Mulliner tales. Taking the occasional chance to read more widely in Wodehouse, however, I came across French Leave, which is delightful in every sense and repays even more than better known Wodehouse fare in becoming more tangled, involving more cultures and sensibilities, and painting a very special picture of young love. French Leave could easily be a Doris Day movie, painting, as it does a visual travelogue in which its actresses' high spirits and light comedy can have free reign, with the unerring touch of the master.	1999-09-27
