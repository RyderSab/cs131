The writing style is almost musical in places - which is quite appropriate, given one of the themes of the book, musicianship.  It is a quiet book, in that there are no major conflicts that occur in the time of the book, but nevertheless it has plenty of substance.  The relationships between all of the characters are very well drawn and you can feel respect they have for each other.  I would love to spend an evening at the cafe, eating and listening to the music.	2005-04-16

It is logically organized and can be used as a resource, but I found it interesting enough to read cover to cover, as well.  <br />For me, an especially useful detail in the book was the description of how to use the results of talent search tests to differentially provide mathematical instruction to students with various score levels.  As a parent of a child who took one of these tests, I was never sure how to interpret the results.  As a teacher, I will now know.<br />The book is a very useful guide.	2004-07-07

I found it to be a sensitive, insightful, and hilarious observation of culture and youth.  Blacky is growing up in a remote town where footy (Australian rules football) is the only entertainment around.  The whole town focuses on footy, but since the town is so small, in order to field a team, both Gunjas (whites) and Nungas (aboriginals) are needed.  The aboriginals have an entirely different style of play, and one of them, Dumby, is an outstanding player.  Blacky, the narrator, is not an especially talented footy player, but he is an excellent observer of adolescence and small town life.  He and Dumby start out as enemies, but become friends, when Blacky is forced to respect both Dumby's excellent play and his honorable behavior.  <br />The book on the surface is about footy, small towns, and adolescence, but there is a deeper exploration of racial, family, and community relationships, and the tragedy that throws a flood light on everything.  <br />I am not sure where the other reviewers are coming from, but I recommend this book highly, along with its sequel Nukkin Ya, which is even more outstanding.	2004-02-26

But it is simply too good to dislike.  Jessica is an intelligent, observant teen with heart and humor.  Her friend Hope, a soulmate, has moved away and Jessica is forced to confront the world of high school with no one to share her true thoughts with.

US	52831598	R1CQLEG7HWT4SU	0689861893	384998515	Aleutian Sparrow	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Emotionally moving	It is difficult to convey the entirety of the experience of the Aleutians after the Japanese bombing - their confusion and dismay at being taken away from their homes and villages, the nearly total lack of compassion their \\"rescuers\\" demonstrated toward their homes, their lives, and their people.  In this heartbreaking account of the relocation of the Aleutians for 3 years during World War II, Karen Hesse beautifully and movingly conveys the feelings of one young girl who grows up in this time.  <br />This is one case where free verse seems to be the best medium to convey the story.  Free verse appeals to images and emotions and not just plot.  In truth, this book is not plot driven; you don't read it to find out what happens next.  You read it because it tells you how it felt, what it looked like, how it changed the people.  <br />It joins a long line of books, some of which deal in a parallel manner with the relocation of people of Japanese ancestry from the west coast during the war, some of which deal with other events, such as the bringing of diseases and religious, linguistic, and cultural changes by early missionaries to these and other peoples.  All of these make you wonder, \\"Why?\\"  How could we have been so cruel, so lacking in understanding?  What are we doing even now that, in future years, we will again look upon with sadness and horror at people's inhumanity toward other people?<br />As a teacher, I feel books like this make excellent complements to classroom textbooks.  Books like this make history come alive and feel real.  And they provide some balance.  It is not only Hitler who did unspeakable things; there are other examples, from both \\"sides\\" - throughout history.<br />And a brief compliment to the illustrator and cover designers.  It is a beautiful book as well.	2003-10-11

The premise of this book, a trip to get away from it all, is, as has been said, nothing new, but this book is extremely well-crafted in making all of the characters plausible and real - AND INTERESTING.  Robin is dreading her boyfriend's first year at college while she is still in high school, when he gets a trip to Italy as a graduation present from his rich parents.  Rather than falling apart entirely, Robin takes her mother's and her aunt's suggestion of accompanying her aunt and her cousins on a trip to California. <br />The best thing about this book is its lack of the melodramatic.  All of Robin's relationships seem so real.  She makes mistakes; she recovers.  She gets mad at her cousin; she learns to sometimes hold her tongue.  She doesn't pretend to like everything that comes her way, but she learns to tolerate it and with that, she not only begins to enjoy herself, she becomes able to help both herself and her family.<br />I have enjoyed other works by this author and this is another good one.  The special quality about this one is that it feels GOOD to have read it - almost like you have learned a gentle lesson yourself.	2003-09-19
US	52831598	R28OHASH1ZQ7G2	0060080817	421683426	After	Books	4	15	16	N	N	Chilling	Although the writing style of this book is a bit mundane and blunt, the story itself sent chills up my spine - and that doesn't happen often to me.  <br />The basic premise of the book is that, in the wake of Columbine and similar school disasters, school security is beefed up and students are subjected to new rules and regulations.  Some of these regulations seem reasonable, but some, from the outset, seem odd.  People are so nervous about violence in schools, though, that they seem to be willing to give up little things for the larger goal, supposedly better security at the school.  Even though the kids are wary and nervous about what is happening, the changes are relentless and escalate.<br />Some classic methods of manipulation and intimidation are used and, in spite of the students' sense that this is wrong, everyone seems reluctant to challenge them and their parents seem to be all too willing to go along.  <br />This is a compelling book - chilling and creepy.  It is also a relevant book, especially in the wake of all the new regulations for flying and airport security.  <br />But the book is also flawed.  The writing style, as mentioned in the official review is prosaic and simplistic.  And the motive behind the new regulations is puzzling.  It is reasonable to expect that in the course of implementing new security safeguards that some people will get carried away with them and become too rigid and too enamored of the power to determine other people's lives.  But, in this case, the primary mover behind the regulations is evil from the start.  And, other than blind hate, we never know why.  <br />The ending of the book, is, as mentioned by others, not completely satisfying.  There is some resolution to various of the subplots - confidence in Dad, relationship to Dad's girl friend, relationship to friends.  But too much is left hanging.  Is the author holding out for a sequel?<br />Still, it is a good read.  I read the whole thing in one day, practically in one sitting.  It is unusual to find a page-turner like that.<br />P.S.  The book is similar in tone to The Children's Story by James Clavell.  This one is a bit more current, but Clavell's story is certainly a classic of this genre.	2003-05-11

Collins and A Guide for Using The Hobbit in the Classroom by John Carratello.  I like this product very much for the higher level thinking activities, lessons, and strategies.  For my purposes at this time (I am not currently teaching gifted classes), the Collins unit is better, but there are several activities I especially like from this book. The Runes translation activity my students enjoyed.  The Carratello book is much simpler and the activities are more tangential, although I found the riddle activity useful in that book as well.<br />The advantage of the Collins product is that it is a PDF file on CD and can be word processed for different purposes.  The advantage of this product is that the format is already fine for photocopying and student use.	2003-03-25

It has vocabulary lessons, study guides, quizzes, lesson plans, and extra materials, such as crosswords and word searches.  The level of the material seems to be about right for my regular ed 7th graders, although it would be nice to have some more complex material as well.  My students don't need it, but honors and gifted students could benefit from it.  If you are teaching those classes, I would recommend The Hobbit: A Teaching Guide by Kathy Kifer, in addition to this CD.<br />The major reason I gave this CD 4 stars is that I don't have Adobe Acrobat and transferring the material to a word processor is tedious.  I need to edit some of the pages to make them easier to photocopy and use as student handouts.  This would be much easier with Adobe Acrobat.<br />Two minor quibbles:  It is Gloin, not Golin and Durin's Day is the dwarves' new year, not the elves'.  My students caught the latter error and I was actually rather proud of them for reading that carefully.<br />All in all, though I do recommend this CD.  It has made teaching this book MUCH easier for me.	2003-03-25

There are some additional applications with regard to learning and studying, but they seem almost too obvious.  They are on the order of: if you like things ordered and structured, then try to order and structure a more amorphous assignment, so it will be easier for you.

The Feed knows your buying preferences, your entertainment preferences, how to plug the latest fashion to fill your every want and it knows how to generate your next \\"need\\". This is consumerism on steriods. <br />And, speaking of steroids, there is a trip to the tissue farm, where filet mignon is growing in the fields. <br />The dialog is so real; the consumerism is so possible; the degradation of the global environment is so near. This book paints a picture of a world that is truly more frightening than horror stories. <br />All of this is ingeniously included in a boy meets girl story of seemingly normal adolescence.<br />Scariest of all: it seems almost inevitable. <br />An outstanding effort by M.

It gave me an entirely different and deeper understanding of our base 10 system and set my brain up for understanding the binary system of computers later on.  I have been toying with ways to teach students about this concept ever since and this was also one of my ideas.  In fact, I have collected rubber alien figures with differing numbers of fingers so I can use them as manipulative examples of how and why other number bases would work.  <br />The only thing I do differently is place less emphasis on the binary system, until students understand a higher base.  But I have seen others teach binary first and other bases later and that has worked for them, too.<br />OK, this book is not for everyone, but I do think it is a cute and interesting introduction to other number bases and, for students for whom concepts like this are actually fun and exciting, it is definitely worthwhile.	2002-11-02

I enjoyed this book more than I did the first book in the series, but reading the first one is important in order to follow the rest of them.  Even so, there is just something about all three that makes me feel a bit detached from them.  Part of it is that there are too many characters that you are trying to care about.  Part of it is the unrelenting seriousness of the whole thing.  There are humorous parts, but the overall tone is not light-hearted.  That would be fine, except it comes out as a rather uneasy mixture of seriousness and attempts at relieving that seriousness.  <br />I would like to recommend it more whole-heartedly than this, as it does seem to address some interesting issues, but it isn't quite there for me.	2002-10-20

This book is very well written, wonderfully funny, a good plot, etc.  There is only one thing that bothers me.  I wish the author wouldn't dwell so heavily on Remy's sexual exploits.  Why do we have to hear of them in detail starting with 6th grade onward?  Yes, we need to know that she has guys figured out, but do we have to know that she has slept around, and that she does it every chance she gets, or at least she did in the past.  <br />I know this makes me seem too conservative, and I'm not really.  I just think there is too much emphasis on sex (and maybe drinking) and it actually detracts from the main points of the book. Remy is a very interesting character and so is Dexter.  She is cold and calculating; he is goofy and impulsive.  They are hardly a match, yet they are really good for each other.  <br />Recommended, with some reservations.  Sorry, Ms. Dessen.	2002-10-20

It gives a too childish impression to the more sophisticated ideas in the book and 2) I am sorry that the sex scene had to be included. I suppose that is expected of young adult literature these days, but it made a book that I would otherwise have no trouble recommending generally into a book that I would caution more conservative parents about. Please, authors, if one of the characters is still only 14, she and her boyfriend don't need to have sex to resolve the story line. Be creative, think of other choices!<br />Now the part I did like: It is very well written. The characters are appealing and very real, especially, of course, the main characters, but even some of the side characters have unexpected complexity. <br />I also love the activities that Ellen and James did for fun - people watching in cafeterias and airports, concerts where she actually ends up enjoying Strauss, interminable foreign language films. These are just quirky enough to be interesting, but not bizarre. I was a bit surprised at Ellen's sudden interest in and skill at art, which just happened to be what James was interested in - especially since it was suggested by her father, but that was only a minor distraction.<br />Finally, I like the unabashed description of the rest of Ellen's social life - notes home about a lack of social skills and her perplexity at having to discuss trivia as a requirement to get to know people at her new school. <br />It is a good book and well worth the time.	2002-10-20

I found the first book verging on silliness in places, but this book was much less so.  <br />One of the \\"blurbs\\" on the book compares this book to the Harry Potter books, but I wouldn't put it in that category.  It is more pensive and is rarely as funny or fun-loving as the HP books.  The HP books also have a down-to-earth-ness about them that this book doesn't have as much.  It is definitely fantasy.<br />The reason I gave the book only four stars is that I have a bit of trouble really getting interested in the characters.

This could be the companion to the Survival Guides for Gifted Kids.  Too bad the title Survival Guide for Gifted Teachers doesn't quite work.<br />At any rate, I have found the book to be packed with good, concrete suggestions for adding a much needed social and emotional component to any gifted program.  It would be wonderful if it were in notebook size, so the questionaires and exercises could just be photocopied, but at least they are laid out well.  This book is full of good, workable suggestions and is recommended highly for all teachers, but especially those teachers who deal with gifted students.	2002-07-13

Her motives were conflicted, as in real life, but minor triumphs gradually blossomed into real convictions and abilities. <br />I also enjoyed the boy-girl sub-plot.  It is nice to see teens becoming friends before they get involved in a boy-girl relationship. <br />All in all, this was a very enjoyable book to read.	2002-04-06

His anger and resolve are contrasted to clan/gang rivalry in England.  The premise and story line of the book are both fine.  The problem comes from the confusion of details.  The reader is never quite sure who belongs to what group and why they do what they do.  There just isn't enough development.  I never got enough from any of the characters to really care about them as much as I wanted to.	2002-03-10

It is an interesting concept, but, unfortunately, it is doomed to be a bit superficial.  If you are looking for an involving story of the Trojan War, this isn't it.  If you are looking to explain that the story of the Trojan War is relevant even now, this book does a nice job of pointing out the parallels.	2002-03-10

The arrival of a \\"lost\\" uncle and a boy he is taking care of sets off a string of events that break through the icy core of reserve she has been harboring since her arrival.  <br />This is another book that gives you a better understanding of another culture - or perhaps a deeper understanding of your own.  The complex lives of people who have come to America and left their own country are sensitively portrayed here.  The central story, although a bit predictable, is told so sympathetically that you can practically feel the individual and separate joys and pains of each person.	2002-02-10

Reading about Cole dealing with his all-consuming anger is fascinating - and it seems real.  There are times when the book gets a bit too preachy, but that is real life, too - I hear teachers and parents preaching like that to their kids all of the time.  <br />The question I have, though, is will the kids who need this most ever read it?  While it can certainly help other kids (and people who deal with kids) understand the most violent and conning teens around them, can it help the cons themselves?  Maybe.  I hope so.  It is certainly a fresh look at the problem.	2001-11-24

Although one reviewer found the writing choppy, in going from one perspective to the next, I didn't feel like that.  I found it interesting to see how each of the characters saw the same event in completely different ways.  <br />I especially like the way that Lori is written.  Everything comes out nastier than she really meant it to when she says it.  It is almost as though teenager-hood is forcing her to be mean and vindictive.<br />The ending does come a bit abruptly, but I was ready for it.  The road trip gets tiring after a while - just like it does in real life - and you just want to get home.  Fortunately, each one of the characters has learned something.  It isn't an overly happy ending, but it is satisfying.	2001-11-18

Theo is angry and exhausted by the demands placed on him as the only hearing person in a deaf household.  Ivy doesn't have as much problem with that aspect of dealing with deafness, but she does have to deal with being abandoned by her mother.  <br />There were a few minor problems with the book that left me feeling a bit short-changed, though.  It was never clear to me that Theo really did have a passion for math.  He is referred to as a math person, but I just didn't feel the urge of his hopes and his dreams - they weren't nearly as real as his exhaustion with his mother or his attraction to Ivy.  <br />The other thing that bothered me was the last chapter - the telling of how it all comes out.  This was way too simplistic for me - a sort of &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot; ending.<br />Still, it is a worthwhile read, if only to &quot;hear&quot; the real feelings of people in a household that is considered to be different.	2001-11-12

As a sequel, this book follows Elijah, who recently<BR>escaped from the mental hospital in which he was being held and<BR>is picked up in the forest by a group of terrorists who are<BR>bent on disrupting and eventually destroying the repressive<BR>government of the United States.  <br />Elijah, who is for a long time mute and who is usually outside <BR>of the happenings in the compound, eventually makes friends with<BR>Amber, the daughter of the head of the group.  Amber is uneasy<BR>about certain aspects of the goals of the group, but she can't<BR>articulate the reasons for her growing sense that something is<BR>wrong.  <br />Both of the major characters have to eventually face the realities<BR>of the world with regard to their personal commitments to each<BR>other and to the mission of the group, when Amber is the target of<BR>an attempted assault and the terrorism of the group goes further<BR>than they can fathom.  <br />The eeriness of this tale comes from the &quot;bombing of the towers&quot;<BR>and the attempt to infect the whole world with small pox.  <br />As with Welcome to the Ark, though, the ending of this story goes<BR>just a bit too far into fantasy for my taste.  Most of each of the<BR>books is realistic and so possible that you would almost think<BR>that the characters are real.  But then, at the very end, the<BR>books get mystical and veer off into fantasy.  Yes, there may be<BR>powers that these kids have that can't be explained by modern<BR>science, but that almost seems like a cop out, given the very real<BR>world problems they are confronting.  <br />Still, I am eager for the next in the series.	2001-10-25

This book explores a lot about<BR>that topic, but it is basically the story of some &quot;mis-fit&quot;<BR>friends who stick together, even though they are very<BR>different from each other.  <br />It is, in the end, the characters who make the book.  The<BR>premise is rather familiar - outcasts band together to try <BR>to conquer the world.  They gain self-acceptance, if not<BR>popularity with their peers.  But the appealing part of<BR>this story are the people themselves.  Each person could<BR>easily be a stereotype, but instead they are given more<BR>depth and quirky characteristics that make them seem more<BR>human, real, and interesting.<br />There are some inconsistencies, in the book, as in life.<BR>The very kids who are campaigning against name-calling<BR>participate in name-calling themselves.  I believe it is<BR>purposefully included by the author to illustrate how <BR>ingrained, and sometimes not really harmful name-calling <BR>can be.  There is a fine distinction between friendly<BR>teasing and less friendly put-downs.  Where do you draw<BR>the line?<br />I rarely give 5 star ratings to any book, and I didn't <BR>for this one, but it is still an interesting and worthwhile<BR>story to read.	2001-10-10

I have been looking for a book to get my middle school<BR>gifted classes interested in talking about philosophical<BR>issues and this is one book that I have found that addresses<BR>that need.  <br />The actual organization of each section isn't exactly what I<BR>would like, however.  I think the students might be more<BR>interested in a confrontational approach.  What I mean by <BR>that is that the book asks the question and then gives the<BR>students some choices.  It then goes on to explain that how you<BR>selected your answers determines whether you think like X, where<BR>X is a famous philosopher.<br />It is at this point, that I would find it interesting to<BR>interject some controversy.  X thinks this, and here is<BR>why, but Y thought this and these are the resons why they<BR>disagree.  <br />I would also like more of the multiple choice questions.<BR>The students seem to really like taking mini-tests to<BR>see what they are like, e.g., if you marked mostly A's<BR>you are an Aristotelian, if you marked mostly B's you<BR>think more like Des Cartes. <br />Nevertheless, I have found the book to serve its purpose.<BR>The students are discussing philosophy and they are <BR>exploring the fact that perhaps the teacher doesn't have<BR>all of the answers.  Maybe nobody knows all of the answers.<BR>Maybe, even, they might get a chance to make up their own<BR>minds.  In that sense, this is a good book.	2001-10-10

Wade is NOT excited about going to a fancy school out of the neighborhood for a gifted program.  But his family insists that he go, so each morning  he and a girl from his school are taken across town to attend the gifted  program.  They are not given a royal welcome, but they are also both a bit  reluctant to reach out.  The realities of such a situation are clearly  described.  Thankfully, there is little attempt to preach a solution.   Wade's uncle does mention prejudice against blacks and people from their  neighborhood, but he doesn't leave out other factors.  Wade does manage to  reconcile himself to the circumstances and even to begin to feel more  comfortable.  Although he does get some support from his family, he and  Dink do most of the work themselves.  <br />Good enough and real enough to  hold kids' attention, but there is also enough food for thought, too.	2000-08-26

Both girls take a journey with others  and thereby come to be able to accept their own tragedies and get on with  life.  <br />This book is enough different that it does hold the reader's  interest, but I rather wish that it didn't have so many similar echoes to  its predecessors.	2000-06-16

There are parts of the book that are necessarily a bit dry, e.g., the explanation of how and why she tried to regain her amateur status  after playing as a professional.  Most of the book, however, does an  excellent job of getting the reader to feel her seemingly boundless energy  and determination.  It also does a good job of portraying the limitations  of the era on female athletes.  It doesn't make them into tragedies, but it  does point out that they were more &quot;hurdles&quot; that Babe had to  overcome.<br />For those interested in biographies of famous women, this book  and Freedman's book about Eleanor Roosevelt are both excellent additions to  the young adult library.	2000-05-20

Preface:  I am not a native German speaker and I read the book in English before reading it in German.<br />While reading a book about flubberworms and magic potions is difficult from the standpoint of new vocabulary, it is so  exciting and satisfying when you realize that you are enjoying the story  and not just the struggle to understand a foreign language.

There is also a bit of self-righteousness in getting even.  Nonetheless, this is a sympathetic look at farm life and kids' aspirations.  It is an up-to-date look at aspects of life that aren't  usually presented to citified kids - a modern day dairy farm and,  peripherally, the lives of migrant workers. Even the crudeness serves to  make the book more realistic. The characters are well drawn and interesting  - each with their own strengths and weaknesses.	2000-05-20

I found it to be both endearing and entertaining, but I was a little disappointed about the depth.  There are many problems in various settings that are alluded to in the book, but they seem to be painted in stark  outlines and then the story rushes on.  <br />The ending also left me a bit  unsatisfied.

The young girl, Parvati, is unusual from her birth on.  She has the ability to remember  everything, the ability to communicate with animals, and above all she  wants to dance.  Since her family is devastatingly poor, there is no way  she can pursue her dream, until a guru from far away comes to watch her.   He offers her training, but that means giving up her family life.  The  training will also allow her to send money to her family to help them out  of their poverty.<br />The author of this book is extremely good at helping  you understand not only a different culture, but also the people who live  in that culture.  She does this not by didactic descriptions, but rather by  thoughtful inclusion of the necessary indicative details.  <br />The ultimate  test of Parvati's dedication is her attraction to a boy, and the  possibility of a second true friend.  It is important that Staples doesn't  gloss over the agony of this decision.<br />Overall, another good book from  Staples.	2000-04-17
