Well, that is not the purpose of this excellent introduction to Mary's role in Western Christian theology. It is more about how the culture as a whole sees Mary --- from traditional views to modern liberation ideas. I must add that the book is very balanced as well and only the most jaded of conservatives and liberals will take offense at it. <br />   I was seeking a book about the history of Mary in Western culture after having a particularly meaningful Jungian-type dream about her. I found In Search Of Mary to be exactly what I was looking for after examining many books in my local bookstore. <br />   I can't believe this book doesn't have an average rating of 4 stars. Some more reviews by fairer critics will hopefully rectify the situation soon.	2005-07-09
US	52100922	R24RH7D52ON4KL	8185120544	311084769	The Holy Vedas	Books	4	12	15	N	N	Simply Awesome	This is a devotional style book with short quotes from selected passages in the Vedas accentuated with photos from nature. I can't understand why the Vedas are not more widely translated into English. They are probably one of the oldest religious texts known to man, they are extremely interesting and they are very readable, unlike some more widely known ancient books like the Egyptian Book of the Dead. They remind me a lot of the Hebrew Psalms, only with that characteristic Indian exoticness. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the typically bad print-quality common with Indian publishers.	2005-04-19

You have to see this book to believe it! I stumbled across a copy in our local bookstore the other day and just couldn't believe the incredible photos and anatomical images in this work of art. Actual photos of men and women with their inner anatomy superimposed like a 3D x-ray over the photo. The poses are not your standard DaVinci's Man kind of pose either---we're talking yoga, dance, etc. If you're familiar with Alex Grey's artwork, this is just like that only with photographs. Highly recommended to medical professionals, curious laypersons, practitioners of yoga and fans of Alex Grey.	2004-10-30

The action is all on a primitive planet which seems better suited for the WH fantasy series than WH40K sci-fi. The action is few and far between.

The only review of this book as of this date is extemely negative. I really enjoyed this book, especially the Princess Charybdia and her twistedly evil city of pleasures. I've never really expected WH novels to be great Hugo-prize winning novels of Sci-Fi---they're just a lot of fun to read and they put you into a fantastic gloomy surreal mood. Give this novel a chance. I really liked it.	2003-07-30

Fast-paced action, a demon prince, an female Eldar warrior and a Farseer who seemed (at least to me) to be major players in the story as well as a battle in a mysterious dead city on an Eldar home world. The chapter about the Navigator's journey into the warp is fantastic, as well as all the background info about Eldar history. Good stuff if you want my opinion. In fact it is near to being my favorite of the 12 Warhammer novels I've read so far.	2003-07-30

Despite the cheesy title, this is a bona fide invaluable resource, especially for those who do postures, but are unfamiliar with Hindu philosophy. The first half of the book is a basic introduction to yoga philosophy. The second half, believe it or not, consists of ample selections from the Upanishads, as well as the entire texts of the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, all translated into contemporary English with no complicated sanskrit terms---all in this tight little compact paperback.

US	52100922	RPOKBKCKRJAFX	0743443187	682997292	Draco (Warhammer Novels)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	My first!	This was the first Warhammer 40K novel I ever read---something about the cover art resurrected strange dark emotions in me which had been repressed for too long. After reading this book, I've never looked back---I now try to read every Warhammer novel I can find. As for those who didn't like it, I can't imagine why. It reads like a movie. It is loaded with action, an endless variety of Imperial, Chaos and alien-filled worlds---and since it is an Inquistion novel, the action doesn't consist entirely of repetitious Vietnamesque battle scenes like you find in some Warhammer novels. It's more like comparing a James Bond film to a 1950's war flick. If you like tank-filled battle scenes then stay away. If you like conspiracies, strange alien worlds and magical artifacts, then this may be more your style. This trilogy and Dan Abnett's Eisenhorn trilogy are still the best Warhammer books I've read so far. Don't pass this one up!	2003-05-24

It is a fascinating glimpse into the almost mythological times of the Empire's founding and the tale of one man from that time period who returns to the 41st century to carry on his Lutherite campaign to cleanse the Empire of corruption --- thus being branded heretic by his contemporaries. Though low on action (until the end), it is heavy on brooding atmospherics and raises the question, is Astelan a heretic or the last true follower of the Emperor?	2003-05-24

This is by far one of the best books on yoga I have ever read. There are no postures, just daily meditations on what it means to follow the path of yoga. Each day is preceded by a quote which illuminates that day's thought. Many of the quotes are taken directly from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. The book also roughly follows Patanjali's sutras in it's basic structure. The author went through a life crisis of alchohol addiction and after getting cleaned up, yoga helped him take control of his life and find spiritual peace. The daily meditations are very uplifting and will make you better appreciate your life, improve your relationships and refine your spiritual path. A highly recommend this book. It may just change your life for the better.	2003-04-26

This is one of the most incredible books I've ever read. In this &quot;translation&quot; of the Book of Going Forth By Day (the original Egyptian name for the Book of the Dead) Ellis sings the world into existence and exposes the very depths of my soul like no other writer ever has. It is not a literal translation, but more of a contemporary reflection of what the various chapters mean, a very poetic, smoothly flowing meditation on &quot;Becoming Osiris&quot; and living life like the gods we are. If you've ever been interested in Egyptian thought or mythology, you will love this book!<br />  I am Osiris. I walk between the two worlds. I am the maker of myths. I remember all that was and what will be. I am eternal, existing for the millions of years. When you see the sun, remember me, remember your Self.	2003-02-15

I really liked it. I decided that I would like to read something else by Ruiz. I picked up this book and flipped through it in the bookstore. First of all, you find a bunch of crazy stuff about egg-shaped auras ripped off from Castanada. Then you find him saying he received a vision about Jesus having a wife and child who lived in France that he actually took from \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" Then you find out really what an intellectual lightweight he is when you read that Charlemagne melded Christianity to Roman Power. Excuse me, that was Constantine---not Charlemagne---neither he, Ms. Nelson or any of the editors caught this most basic historical blunder. Basically, Miguel goes from writing a very insightful little book (4 Agreements) to full-fledged historical-revisionist, New Age-guru crazy lunatic.	2003-01-11

Power yoga is great for Americans, especially those who are used to more aerobic workouts and especially for those like me, who have bodies naturally inclined toward strength training and not toward flexibility. Don't get me wrong---you get plenty of flexibility poses with Power Yoga---there are still poses I can't do yet---but there's none of that head under the legs, kissing your back kind of flexibility in Power Yoga. Warrior poses to develop leg strength are essential to this style, as well as some challenging balancing poses. If this sound's like your kind of thing, Geo's book is excellent and provides more info than many other power yoga books. Good luck with your training and Namaste!	2003-01-02

He revels in paradox and turns all your notions of history and how the world works upside-down. Basically he was an Edwardian C.S. Lewis. His opinions and observations about Christianity and modernity are the whole point of reading the book. Hope this helps. Enjoy!	2002-02-06

I have just finished reading Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther and I don't think I've read anything so powerfully moving in years. It is at once both tragic and beautiful. The story consists of letters that Werther has written to a friend describing his passion for &quot;Lotte&quot;, his charming, but very married, love interest. We watch as the overly-romantic Werther gradually becomes unhinged and finally kills himself when he realizes he can't have his beloved. Besides this lovely, sad story you also get Goethe's beautiful translation of Ossian's poems near the end. Reading this novella brought back memories of how I once had such passionte yearnings for the loves of my own life --- before I thankfully (and regretfully) got more worldly-wise. This one will be high on my favorites list and will be re-read often.	2000-10-16
