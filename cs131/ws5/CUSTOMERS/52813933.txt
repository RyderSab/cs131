I really enjoyed this beautifully written book and found it a fascinating tale of an era long ago.

James is actually literature and not for those who want a &quot;quick read&quot; or a lot of gunfire.  This author is a master of the genre and uses it to explore the human condition.  The characters are not simple cardboard cutouts who spout tough talk.  These are well developed, thoughtful portraits that reflect humanity.  From the beginning of the series to the present novel, it becomes clear why P.D. James is one of the most respected British authors.  I have looked forward to and treasured each book and this is one of Ms. James' best.  I envy those readers about to discover her.	2004-01-24

Beautifully written as usual, with rich characterizations and descriptions of time and place.  His depictions of tortured souls and the ambiguous conflict between good and evil leave the reader spiritually enriched and more thoughtful regarding the ills of society and the individual.  There is no black and white.  Nothing is clearcut and easily solved.  And in the creation of Dave Robicheaux, the troubled and conflicted &quot;hero&quot; of these novels, Burke has given literature, not just the mystery genre, one of its most interesting and tragic figures.  If you have never read James Lee Burke, begin with the first novel in this series and discover one our great American authors.  I envy those who have the pleasure of doing so for the first time.	2004-01-02

Despite historical and factual errors, this thriller does move fast and kept my interest until it's outlandish, ridiculous ending. The characters and dialog are cartoonish at best, but this isn't serious fiction, just a silly romp. In fact, it's very, very funny at times.  The author's acknowledgements at the end are a real hoot in themselves.  Based on this opus, I think I'll skip his latest blockbusting triumph.	2003-08-16

This is a beautifully written, wonderfully realized book that will haunt readers long after they close the cover.  It is witty and wise, sad and funny, challenging and simple.  I counsel many people who are grieving for lost loved ones and grief is seldom depicted with such understanding and insight as here.  This is a novel I will not forget and the people in it are etched in my memory forever.

The last few books in this series have been pretty poor attempts at the hard boiled school and this one sinks even lower.  The writing and plot are hardly up to the standards set in earlier efforts.  Kellerman has lost his way and to say this book is disappointing is an understatement.  A repugnent waste of time in which Alex's profession is irrelevannt as there is little that is psychological here.  Perhaps the author needs therapy or just a writer's workshop.  At any rate, there is certainly something wrong.  A session with Dr. Gregory in Boulder might help.	2002-11-29

I embraced my vows and dedicated myself completely to following Christ.  However, I found that I was the only heterosexual in my novitiate class.  With the spiritual guidance of a superior, I chose to stay for seven years and tried to understand and not judge those who were openly gay.  The sad part is that these gay men demanded that their sexual orientation be not only accepted, but condoned even when they were sexually active.  In our Berkeley house of studies, I was the lone straight man among 9 seminarians.  I finally felt that I could not remain because I was treated and felt that I was an outsider.  The gay culture was not what I was there for.   If I protested what I saw, then my brothers told me I was homophobic or gay myself and couldn't face it.  Perhaps I didn't actually have a true vocation.  Perhaps I was at fault. But this book and other emerging evidence has revealed that there is indeed a gay culture dominating the seminaries and the priesthood that may drive out those who are not gay.  I'm glad this secret is being made public.  I have long wondered, for many years, if I was the only one who could see it. Now, finally, I am not alone.  Thank you, Mr. Rose, and God bless you.  The Church has been in denial too long.	2002-06-27

The spiritual struggle of the individual is thoughtfully depicted and the realistic description of the End Times is totally honest.  This is a troubling, hard-edged, hard-to-take story, for adult readers who are prepared for a challenge.

He is a lousy writer, but his stories remind me of old Saturday afternoon serials. His characters are like old friends now and he has an added an element of introspection in Dirk Pitt this time around. Old Dirk is aware that, well, that he's getting older! Now that in itself is deep for this series. Could it be that Dirk may swing a little slower from those vines and have to grip knives in his dentures soon? Now, I'm not putting Cussler down because these books have helped me survive many a long plane flight and wait in line. They are not great literature and I feel a little silly for loving these books as much as I do. This one is another reunion with old friends and it will mean a lot to fans.	2001-08-27

However, his Nazi bias seems to be on a short leash this time out.  Most of the time this is a reasonable history of the trials.  Could this be an attempt to become an actual historian?  Irving  hauls a lot of baggage with him, but he does keep his facts straight in  this book and doesn't twist them, then blitz the reader with footnotes to  cover his tracks.  Refreshing.	1999-12-16

It has depressed the hell out of me  and upset the whole family.  Perhaps a picture of a cat remembering the  family he left behind and dreaming of a future reunion would have been  better than a cat watching his old home from afar.
