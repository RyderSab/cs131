However, you will protect the purchasing power of your savings, no matter what happens to the markets.  This book is for the person who wants to invest his/her money in such a way that you can simply leave it in those investments - with occasional adjustments when one part or another becomes too large a part of your portfolio - and then turn your energies to more interesting or useful pursuits.  You essentially become independent of all the investment hullabaloo and can put all your concentration on your collection of cigar rings, or whatever suits your fancy.  I agree with H L Mencken who said that the value of money is greatly overrated (with my addendum - as long as you don't have to worry about it).	2005-10-10

Page after page about political shenanigans.  That might have been okay, but the book doesn't even tell you much about what life in China was like at that time.  The behavior of the government officials during that time at that place were pretty much like what goes on today in governments or any bureaucracy for that matter.  If anything, the book shows that it's pretty much the same story no matter where or when.  What a stifling position it was to be an emperor at that time - a life of obligatory ritual after ritual.  At any rate, my main criticism is that I feel I learned precious little about China, much less the China of the Ming dynasty.	2005-08-21

Boring (to me) were the anecdotes about her drinking, her dieting, worry over her son's wanting to ?parasail, her son's health, whether a mole she had was cancer,etc.  This is a book for women and for people who have been drunks and are now sober.  Some of the anecdotes were good, but I didn't feel any of it said much about religion - yes, there was a chapter on finding God, but it didn't impress me.  The author is intelligent and can write well, but that's about all I can say.  This book is not a memorable one for me.  Now I'm in search of one of those books that just carries me seemingly effortlessly into another world and one from which I will feel I have gained some truly valuable insights.	2005-07-18

I don't remember how I stumbled upon this book here at Amazon, but I read a bit of the excerpts and was immediately hooked.  I guess the fact that I had recently read about Lincoln, made me want to take a look at the confederate side.  Sam Watkins was obviously a wonderful, sensitive, intelligent person.  What the heck is war, anyway?  A lot of really nice people killing a lot of other really nice people.  Was the civil war simply over the states' right to secede? And if the CSA had won, would there now simply be two countries instead of one United States? plus all the other consequent differences.  Slavery?  Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation only because he was afraid Europe was going to support the Confederacy.  Slavery would have gradually been abolished anyway.  Anyway, reading this fascinating confederate private's-eyed view of that war certainly was an educational experience for me.  What can I say more than Grrrrreat book!  Don't miss it!	2005-06-13
US	43118934	R8KYGVSYI22DY	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A good novel	If you need a novel to read to pass the time, this is a good one.  As for me, I'm critical of novels in general.  I didn't find this one to be as good as 'Memoirs of a Geisha'.  However, it was able to stir up my insides as few novels have done; that is, the part about Amir and Sohrab.  That was the end of the book and looking back everything preceding seemed to lead up to that ending.  I almost cried while reading it.<br /><br />The book is very well written, very readable. And the content seems unusual to me.  It is not about sex and romance or about battling and competition.  This book came across to me as a book about honor, honor of a type which is rarely found in reality but to which I (or anyone, I guess) would like to aspire.<br /><br />My one criticism is a criticism I have in general for fiction, except for good historical fiction. It is that the contrivances in the plot seem to stand out annoyingly.  For example, the fight with Assef has an Ayn Rand starkness to it.  There are a number of examples of this in the book which constantly made me aware of the unreality of the story.  I must say that I didn't feel this way about 'Memoirs of a Geisha' except at one part.<br /><br />Read this book if you want a good piece of fiction to pass the time.	2005-06-05

The book struck me as naive, tending toward Pollyanna. Excuse me, all you admirers of this book, but this is honestly how I felt about it.  I find life to be so much more complex than his thesis seems to propose - not that there isn't some truth to what he says.  I like what Alfred North Whitehead said, \\"Morality.... is what the majority then and there happen to like and immorality is what they dislike\\". The Dalai Lama seems to say it is absolute, but I see it as relative.	2005-05-01
US	43118934	R1W81QIFADE1YP	0743480031	350733194	My Glorious Brothers	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Just added this to my short list of favorites	I just finished this book.  First and foremost I really enjoyed reading it.  I decided to read it because I know so little about Jewish history; I had heard the name Judas Maccabeus but I didn't know who he was.  I would like to say that it is wrong to consider this book primarily from the vantage point of describing the Jews.  I kept asking myself if the story of the Maccabeans was considered such an important part of Jewish history, then why did so many Jews let themselves be led to the slaughter by Hitler?  So, for me, this book was not so much about the Jews as it was about history.  Also,to me, this book is fictionalized history, where the author tries to incorporate the facts as much as possible.  Even the narrator in the story, Simon, says you can't take it as genuine fact.  Regardless of that, Howard Fast does a magnificent job.  It took a few pages to get into the flow, but once into the book, I was caught.  I bought this book used for 2 bucks, but I am going to send for a better copy to keep.  For me, the lesson in this book is not so much about how great these ancient Jews were, as it is about why man has to keep fighting wars.  And as a corollary, why our societies demand slavery (of one form or another and don't kid yourself, it exists today, but in a different form).  Of note, these ancient Jews made very limited use of slavery.  One of my favorite teachers once said, \\"Wisdom comes when you put the book down\\".  From reading this book, I felt I learned a great deal about war and slavery.  And I had to ask myself the question, Do the Jews of today believe in the same God who is portrayed in this book about the Jews of 150 years B.C.?	2005-02-20

It is very well-written, easy to read, and educational.  The author has the wisdom of Maimonides, himself.  He deals with his patients as people.  He describes the characters beautifully.  He describes the various diseases so that they are easy to understand.  I'm presently reading about the next-to-the-last of the eight people, but I am so impressed with this book that I wanted to write my review now.  I can honestly say that I wish I were as brilliant, compassionate and thoughtful a doctor as he. I did not find the book depressing.  I think this book should be required reading for anyone who is thinking of going into the field of medicine.	2005-02-04

Look inside this book and read the excerpted first pages.  The writing style continues the same throughout.  The author is a master writer; he is almost a minimalist painter (with words) much like the Chinese landscape painters.  I would say it gave a good picture of China during the time of the cultural revolution, which was the reason I decided I wanted to read this book.  As for the storyline, it made me think about the question, \\"What is love?\\"  Naturally, the book did not really answer the question and the reader has to decide for him/herself.  I came away from this book being glad for the time I spent reading it.  I would recommend this book to anyone, provided they aren't looking for an action packed thriller about cops and robbers or a passion packed sex-filled romance novel.  To me it is a piece of poetry.	2005-01-26
US	43118934	R1TUNEXVPCEOQX	1586482262	235415087	The Power Game	Books	2	2	7	N	N	How not to play the power game	First of all, I don't generally like novels unless they are well-researched historical novels.  So partly as a result of that, I felt this book was a waste of time.  Even though I have no experience in this area, his description of politics in Washington didn't strike me as true to life.  The author made it look like everyone there paid little heed to his brilliant thinking.  But he gave little credit to the wisdom of the machinations of others. Nowhere was there any description of how the President must be wrestling with the advice of the various cabinet members and how he should concede to the President as he has the ultimate responsibility.  And then the subplot of his marriage; he didn't know how to play that power game either. I felt like he let his wife intimidate him.  I felt like he should have told her, \\"Screw your job! Do you want to be my wife or don't you?\\"  He was living in his own world.  It was like a story about a fellow on a basketball team always asking his teammates to pass the ball to him and his repeatedly yelling, \\"I can sink it, I can sink it!\\", meanwhile his teammates ignore him and the coach finally kicks him off the team. He thinks too highly of himself and he bewilderedly wonders why others don't feel that same way.  The main character comes across as a Caspar Milquetoast - not very interesting.	2005-01-20
US	43118934	R242O8O8KPVQFG	0899683207	351036794	Lincoln the Unknown	Books	5	58	70	N	N	One of the ten best books I've ever read	I agree with Oceandweller who said he/she wished this book were still in print so he/she could send a copy to all his/her friends.  This book is terrific right from page one until the very end.  I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid.  Whatever I paid, it was worth it.  It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining.  Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends.  Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men.  \\"With malice towards none and charity for all...\\" these, his words, keep echoing in my mind.  Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation.  His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, \\"When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion\\". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to.  After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them).  This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion.	2005-01-07

The first sex scene was good but after that it just seemed like the author was trying to be sensational - which I find boring.  This sex stuff is interspersed with all sorts of violence and cruelty in the guise of religious ritual, accidents,etc - also boring to me.  Furthermore, I felt this wasn't giving me a genuine picture of Mexico in the 16th century.  When my daughter told me she was half-way through the book and was still waiting for a plot to emerge, I decided I was going to toss the book and assume that the rest of it was going to be 99% garbage like the first quarter.  Why waste my time any more?  I gave it 2 stars because it is well-written, that is, readably written.	2005-01-07

I recognized some of the events of the times, but the adventures he told of going through came across to me as gross exaggerations; just think of the 8 foot+ tall Indians he mentions.  And the story about the race - very, very unlikely.  His tales remind me somewhat of the character in the  movie \\"Bigfish\\".  Even thinking about Tom Sawyer, the incidents in there were not as outlandish as those in \\"Good Old Boy\\".  To me this book was entertaining and well-written, but not really enlightening regarding growing up in the 40's.  I watched baseball in those days, I went into a haunted house, I had my run-ins with a teacher's pet, etc. but I enjoyed Salinger's writing about this stuff much more.	2004-11-08

I found him to be a very interesting person who reflects on himself and what he sees around him.  Naturally the book displays his amazing writing skills; it is wonderful to see how he expresses himself.  I really enjoyed what he said about Love: \\"Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see.  Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me\\".  John Steinbeck, the person people who were close to him knew, lives on in this book for as long as the English language remains unchanged.  He was not too different from many of my friends other than his phenomenal command of the language.	2004-10-24

The author is the wife an Egyptian doctor who was a friend of mine, recently deceased.  It is about their ten years in Egypt during the 1950's.  One can be told that Moslem women are not permitted to do this or that, but hearing about this in the context of everyday life gives a much clearer picture of the situation.  The following are some of what showed up in this book:  a woman's going to a restaurant unchaperoned was frowned upon, women were not permitted to enter the Al-Azhar Mosque, the husband walked three steps in front of his wife while she carried the shopping bags, a man divorces his wife by simply saying \\"I divorce thee\\" three times and thereafter the divorced woman is treated like a leper, if they divorce the man gets the children, and during a wake men and women were separated and women could not attend the burial rites as they were considered to be \\"too emotional\\".  I imagine things have not changed too much there in the last fifty years. The major fault of this book was the difficulty of figuring out what was fact and what was fiction.  The author's name is Lisa, although the main character is named Laura.  I know that her husband's name was not Mounir.  The pictures drawn of her Egyptian relatives may have been fictionalized so as not to alienate them - I don't know.  At any rate, I think the reader can assume that by and large the incidents are factual.  I consider this depiction of life in an Islamic country to be much less biased than \\"The bookseller of Kabul\\" and so I found it very educational in addition to being enjoyable to read.	2004-08-28

Before I knew it, I had finished the book, wishing for more.  When I first went into this line of work, my supervisor said to me that people are funnier than a barrel full of monkeys.  People never cease to amaze me.  Seeing the tremendous variation in personalities and getting a look at what made them the way they are leads to one becoming much more tolerant of others and also much more tolerant of one's own idiosyncracies.  But first and foremost this book was very entertaining without being fantasy.  (I'm the type who doesn't like fantasy because I just keep saying to myself \\"oh, c'mon!\\")  A man falling in love with a polar bear? but he explained how it could happen.  And people who think thoughts can kill - Mary in the book.  Read the book.  You'll be glad you did.	2004-08-27

Howard Fast is an amazing writer.  Reading the book I found myself carried back to the time of the revolution.  Not only do you follow Tom Paine around, but you get peeks at Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Napoleon.  Reading a historical novel like this shows these historical figures as real people - brings them to life just as if they lived in your neighborhood.  True, they are fictionalized but it seems that the author did his best to conform to the known facts.  I have tried a number of writers of historical fiction and find that Howard Fast is among the best.  What a pleasant way to become acquainted with history!	2004-08-09

I did not find it a greatly enjoyable read.  It is written in the old novel style- &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; comes to mind.  Neither did I find that I learned much about it was like to live like a slave during that time.  I am now reading a historical novel in which there are a few pages describing a slave market in the USA during the Revolution; which gave me a much clearer picture than Bondwoman's Narrative did.  The description of how the field hands lived left me wishing to read more about that, and in fact, I felt I did not even get a good picture of how the house servants lived.  There was quite a bit of philosophizing during the entire book so the author came across as an intellectual.  In this respect, her comments about the death of a fellow runaway slave towards the end of the novel were very interesting to me.	2004-07-10
US	43118934	R14W1GK8NKRONK	0316734500	36886929	The Bookseller of Kabul	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	One family in Afghanistan	First of all, I enjoyed the book.  Secondly, it made me think.  However, little of it was truly eye-opening, for me.  I thought much of the misery was due to poverty and family in-fighting which could occur - to a lesser degree- in any country, including the United States.  I had difficulty parsing out how much was due to Islam and how much was culture which is simply attributed to Islam.  In the book &quot;the Princess&quot;, the author states that Islam is not to be blamed for the horrors depicted, but the culture.  Into the mix must be thrown the inaccessibility of obtaining an education in Kabul.  As to the plight of women there, there must be some parents in that country who permit their daughters to marry for love.  So I asked myself, &quot;Did I really learn anything from reading this book?&quot;  The one thing which stands out in my mind is the chapter about the warlords.  Eisner's book &quot;Survivor of the Holocaust&quot; also made this point, namely, that everyone is fighting everyone else. You can't win a football game without team spirit, without some cohesiveness, and respect for one's opponents.  The ballot and the principle of 'may the best man win; and then live and let live' are necessary for a nation's progress.  Without those, a country remains poor, primitive, uneducated, and miserable, because everyone is paranoid about the other guy and thus kills or is killed.  This bookseller's family milieu is primitive and oppressive. Even though the bookseller is well-read, he has not incorporated the lessons in his books.  He is the patriarch of the family and can determine to a great extent the happiness of his progeny, but he is a tyrant.  The one relaxation of his tyranny is shown when he relents and allows his son to go on the pilgrimage to Mazar-i-Sharif. Well, at least female circumcision apparently is no longer practiced in Afghanistan, although there was no reference to it in this book. In summary, though the Moslems have a reputation for this kind of controlling behavior within their families, it would have been a better book if this sort of thing were put in perspective by telling something about families living there who were more liberal and permissive and what happened to the children of such families - if they stayed in Afghanistan.nd of controlling behavior within their families, it would have been a better book if this sort of thing were put in perspective by telling something about families living there who were more liberal and permissive and what happened to the children of such families - if they stayed in Afghanistan.	2004-06-25

It gave me a picture of life there about 40 years ago.  Also it was interesting to get an idea of the dilemma good German people were put in during WWII.  Her brothers fought with the Germans although they decided to turn against the Nazi cause despite the fact that they were in the military.  Her sister who was a nurse wrote \\"...our beloved homeland...\\"  Her father, a Lutheran minister, a loving and kind and wise person, seemed to decide his allegiance was to Germany.  That seems so strange to me.  Yet if I had been told to fight in Viet Nam I might have done so although I was against our involvement there from the beginning.  (Clinton was smart to be a draft dodger!)  At any rate, I enjoyed the part about her time in Argentina.  The rest of the book is really mainly of interest to her relatives and progeny, in my opinion.	2004-06-15

I wanted to know what it was like growing up on a farm in the West Virginia/Maryland area.  The author gave me a good picture of it.  As an adolescent I had worked a couple of summers on a farm in New England and the author is only 4 years older than I am so I could identify to some extent with his life and the times. The book was well-written and easy to follow.  Just to mention two things which interested me: 1) what it was like for him witnessing his pet calf killed for beef, and 2) eating every part of the pig they butchered.  I'll quote about 2): &quot;We ... loved brains mixed in fried eggs. Most people gag when they hear that we ate this, but we loved it. We didn't waste any parts of the hog&quot;.  That's farm life - close to the realities of nature.  The first reviewer mentioned something about reference to religion.  Fortunately for me, I didn't feel there was enough talk about God and religion to mention.  They were good people - I particularly appreciated the anecdote about how his father refused to attend church once he heard the minister speak badly of the blacks - and the religious feeling emanating made me think of Frank Lloyd Wright's saying, &quot;I believe in God only I spell it N-A-T-U-R-E&quot;.	2004-05-15

I came away from it feeling glad that I took the time to read it.  Contrary to how I feel after reading some books written in a highly polished manner, this book came across to me as very real (this ain't Agatha Christie), and the author came across as a diligent, intelligent, scientifically minded, fair, and appropriately humble man.<br />What I learned:  I got a glimmering of the huge amount of painstaking examination of detail involved in forensic pathology, I got an idea of how court procedure can hinder the bringing out of the truth, I got a glimpse of how easy it is to bungle the preservation of the evidence, and I got a picture of the number of dedicated people who work together trying to solve whodunits.  I also got a view into the personalities of a few wife-murderers.<br />The page 9 gaffe about chopsticks not falling to the floor in a vacuum was written by Judge Gill (was his memory of the story correct?) and the page 54 mention of those gigantic red blood cells should have been edited out. Two things that stood out in my mind were:  the fact that the drops of blood on Nicole Simpson's back were washed away! (evidence which could have incontrovertibly established the innocence or guilt of O.J.) and the fact that the young girl's testimony that Edward Sherman had had a phony telephone conversation with his wife (attempting to make others think she was still alive) was thrown out at the trial.<br />This book held my interest.  I'm glad that we have people like Henry Lee, Michael Baden, and Cyril Wecht working so hard for all of us.  And I find it fascinating to get a peek at them and how they do their work, in a down-to-earth, unglorified, objective way. That is what this book did for me.	2004-02-28

At the end, the author wrote, \\"Everyone who had a chance to read the manuscript in progress expressed disbelief that all these experiences could have happened to one person and yet he survived.\\"  This is how I felt reading this book.  His will to live and his resourcefulness were amazing.  What guts he had, for example, to plot and to rescue his mother from the Nazi hospital!  He came so close to being killed by the Nazis so many times and managed to escape so many times.  It's hard to imagine that there really are people in the world with such courage.  I didn't want to read another WWII book, but I picked this one up (my wife had bought it)while waiting for my next book to arrive, and once I started it I couldn't put it down.  If you can stand to hear the horrible realities, read this book.	2003-12-08

And what always makes such descriptions more difficult for me is the fact that it was real, true. It was \\"heart wrenching\\" and \\"hard to get through\\" (quoting from other reviewers), and it was painful reading.  Yet I agree that it was an \\"important\\" book and it made me think.  It was about war and if I think I have learned anything about war, it is the fact that if you don't shoot the guy in front of you, you will get shot by the guy in back of you - if you're not with us, you are against us.  This book (for me) wasn't about the Communists versus the Nationalists as much as it was about getting swept up in overpowering conflicting and confusing forces of nature, and struggling frantically with the question of how to save yourself, your belief in yourself, and those you love.  For me, the question of right and wrong lost all meaning here.  I asked myself what I would have done in the various situations described; I concluded that I don't know.  This an important book and a well written book.  But don't read it if you want to read a feel-good book.	2003-11-03

The story captivated me. I developed an admiration for the author's ability to devise the convolutions in the various subplots. I also tend to believe that no matter how clever a person may be, 99% of what happens in one's life is out of our control, even when we have the illusion of having made a choice freely. As to the historical authenticity, I take it on faith that the author did a great deal of research.  And I admit that I am a sucker for happy endings.<br />Only one part of the story stood out in my mind as a faulty contrivance and awoke me from my reverie as I was reading.  That was how Hatsumomo came to her end.  Only then did I become aware of the author racking his brain as to how to accomplish this.  Nevertheless, despite this one flaw, I felt the book was a beautiful work of art and Sayuri and Mameha both possessed the characters of what I would like to think the great geishas had.<br />I read this book because my wife told me she thought I would enjoy it.  I cannot begin to imagine the amount of time, thought and energy the author put into crafting this truly beautiful work.  Can anyone ever write a second novel of such excellence?  I would imagine not.  If I were to write something which were of one-one-hundredth the intricacy of this novel, I would be totally spent for the rest of my life.  However, the bottom line is that it was a real pleasure being absorbed in this fantasy.	2003-09-27

I felt Michener's book just wasn't as good.  Michener's characters just weren't that real.  And his elaborate detailed descriptions of food and clothing annoyed me.  What I liked best were his descriptions of the battles.  Sobieski and the defeat of the Turks at Vienna captivated me.  But even that somehow came across as a legend rather than as realistic history. The chapter on love and arranged marriages was very interesting. I guess my main criticism is that this book came across like the movie 'Braveheart'; which I wished were closer the the Britannica version of the Scottish hero.  But I did feel that I learned a great deal from reading Michener's book - it did put Poland on the map for me.	2003-08-16

However, I felt I learned some invaluable lessons from reading it.  One in particular was the making explicit of something I felt for a long time to be true, namely, the effectiveness of Miss Sullivan's method of teaching.  To put it succinctly, by responding to the child's curiosity and letting it lead you wherever it goes(As opposed to formalized instruction). I feel that though this book has been revered for about 100 years, what Miss Sullivan said repeatedly in this regard is still ignored by our educational system.  Such is life!  Then, Miss Keller's attitude towards failure stands as a ready inspiration for all whose lives are impeded by the fear of failure.  She says, &quot;Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow.&quot;  Her life and her book are testimony to that dictum.	2003-07-10

However, I came away from it thinking it wasn't as good as \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\".  The last chapter about the battle over the Moro river was just as good.  However, the depth of the first three chapters I felt was diminished by the author's sense of humor and his tendency to exaggerate.  For example, the dying of the inscrutable A K Long - taking out his pipe for a smoke and a book to read when he was so seriously wounded, calm in the midst of terror - struck me as unrealistic.  In sum, this was a good book but I would say, not really memorable.	2003-06-13

There is very, very little in it about direct experiences in Nazi Germany.  So much of the book has almost nothing to do with Nazi Germany and is about her family and personal relationships and about her professional development instead.  These were interesting and well written but not particularly enlightening or thought-provoking. The last 80 pages I found mostly pretty boring as they went into details of her research and her analyses of WWII and Nazi Germany and prejudice against the Jews.  I cannot comment on her research, but what she said about the war, etc. I found unenlightening.  I think that this is a nice book for her children and her children's children to have, but for me, I felt let down when I came to the end.  As a side note, I found it amusing that she wrote down so much about the delicious meals she enjoyed here and there.  This was true in Heck's book \\"Child of Hitler\\" also.  The bombs may be dropping around, but boy, the pickled herring was yummy! (to exaggerate my point).  If you are just interested in the musings of and a slice of the life of an intelligent prominent psychologist, then by all means, read this book.	2003-06-05

It even gave me a feeling of inspiration.  But I never would have read it in the first place if I had known about the magical thinking it contained.  When I came to the part about dowsing, I said to myself, &quot;Some people believe in that stuff.&quot;  When I came to the part about telepathy I said to myself, &quot;I know what my wife is thinking before she says it; these 20 or so people were with each other 24/7 so they know each other that well.&quot;  Then I came to part about the compound fracture of the leg (it could have been the fibula) healing enough in one day so the person could walk on it without a cast or other support, I said to myself, &quot;No way, Jose!&quot;  Then a reference to flying saucers!  Yet I guess I was able to suspend my disbelief enough to really enjoy this piece of poetry.  Finally, I don't for one minute believe that the author wrote this just to make a buck - I feel that this is an inspired piece of fiction which contains some truly meaningful messages.  If you don't let yourself be put off by the hoakum, this can be a very enjoyable read.	2003-05-31

Although the style I found not so easy to read, I found this book very thought provoking and enjoyable.  I was able to identify (somewhat tenuously) with this Nazi zealot.  I was able to feel that \\"there but for the grace of God (went) I\\".  This, despite the fact that his twin brother was not as zealous as he, that he saw his best friend taken away as a subhuman Jew, that even the people of his small town knew about concentration camps (what did he think went on there?), and that he witnessed a proud old German Jew WWI veteran, who had lost his leg in that war, punched in the nose till blood spurt forth merely because he complained that he could not get into the truck due to his missing a leg. I wish the author had written somewhat about how he managed to rationalize away these things he witnessed directly. But then, what can he say?  We all want to see ourselves as superior to others and must work at learning that the ugly, the short,the blacks, homosexuals, women, the crippled, the retarded, the mentally ill etc. are just as good as we are. Certainly there are plenty of prejudices present here in the USA also and if we had gone through what Germany went through prior to Hitler's ascendancy, we might also be susceptible to a leader such as he. At any rate, I found this honest personal history very enlightening.  One example:  he says \\"I wish I could shoot the bastard who killed them (his dog and horse)\\" to which the General replies, \\"Nothing wrong with a desire for revenge.\\"  This sentiment seems so normal on the face of it, but he was a Catholic and don't they teach, \\"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord\\"?  I'd like to think an American general would say to me, \\"My boy, war is hell. They kill our loved ones and we kill their loved ones\\".  At any rate,I thought this was a great book. I would recommend it for a book group, so that members would be prompted to discuss the issues it raises.s the issues it raises.	2003-05-25

I wonder whether the author tried the regular publishing houses first and was rejected; I would imagine so.  I really enjoyed this book.  However, I doubt it will gain any popularity unless it were to be energetically marketed.  I think this is a pity, but I guess this is the nature of the business. The cream does not float to the top.  And phenomena like Harry Potter and Stephen King, etc. depend upon niche markets and voluminous production.  Thus people such as me will constantly have to search through the haystacks for needles which we really enjoy.  This one was a find.<br />I happened to see this book on Xlibris.com.  I read an excerpt and I liked the writing style - very easy.  By the way it continues the same way throughout the book.  Then, the subject - psychoanalytic experiences - interested me; as it turned out, that was a small part of the book.  At least 2/3rds of the book is about his personal development during the 1920's, 30's, and 40's.<br />It's hard to really describe the contents because it is really a collection of anecdotes about interesting people the author has met.  They are great fun.  It is like your 93 year old grandfather telling you about his life's experiences.  On page 198 he writes, \\"...there's not much more that's valuable than a good laugh and a happy memory.\\"  That is the essence of this author.<br />One chapter of this book I will never forget.  It is an interview he did with a young man who murdered about 5 people.  He was doing an evaluation for the court.  We read about these people in the newspaper or we hear about them on TV, but how often do we get to sit down with them and ask them, \\"What made you do it?\\" This chapter does that, and I was horrified by the picture I got of this young murderer.  It actually made me depressed for a while.  The author wrote, \\"I had come as close to the essence of evil as I'd ever care to confront.\\"  That's how I felt reading it.<br />Most of the book consists of happy, interesting events.  I hope this book attains popularity; it deserves it.  I enjoyed it and felt I learned a lot.nsists of happy, interesting events.  I hope this book attains popularity; it deserves it.

Why?  Because the females prefer the older males and because elephants apparently keep growing as they age, the older guys are bigger.  So I didn't have it that bad after all when I was young; at least my period of frustration didn't last for 20 years!<br />2. Human females prefer males who have differing Major Histocompatibility Complexes from their own.  How can they tell this?  By whether the guy's odor is pleasing to them or not.  And furthermore, being on the birth control pill abolishes the female's ability to sniff out the right guy! (Hey, the book mentions our species, too!)<br />3. The male sponge louse disguises himself as a female, so he can get past the husband and possess his wife.  And we call them dumb animals and smugly believe we are so smart!<br />4. When a new male lion takes over the harem of an older male lion, he kills all the previous owner's cubs, which brings all the females back into heat!  Now I realize why all those women desire those mafia hit men.  Women say they like nice guys, but it's the really bad, power hungry guys who turn them on.<br />5.  Why does the female praying mantis try to bite off her lover's head?  Get this!  Because then he performs wilder sex.  Well, that explains why sex with femmes fatale is so much more ecstatic - we guys lose our heads with them.  For some reason evolution is doing this stuff to us humans also.<br />6.  Dolphins copulate with turtles, sharks, and eels as well as with their own kind.  I must say, that loveable dolphin is much less inhibited than we are.  We even have a hard time accepting homosexual and interracial sex.<br />  I could go on with fascinating, thought provoking examples from this book. I feel this book achieved its goal as expressed in the final paragraph, that is, to put my problems in perspective and to be more tolerant for the predilections of others.  And it helped me appreciate more fully the awesome power of genetic evolution and for example, how it causes the battle of the sexes - even in humans, I think.<br />  The only weakness I found was in some of the theoretical discussions, like how can homosexuality be as prevalent as it is, when homosexual sex does not cause reproduction.  Or, why is there sex in the first place?  These were difficult to follow.helped me appreciate more fully the awesome power of genetic evolution and for example, how it causes the battle of the sexes - even in humans, I think.<BR>   The only weakness I found was in some of the theoretical discussions, like how can homosexuality be as prevalent as it is, when homosexual sex does not cause reproduction.

I was satisfied in both those regards.  However, I cannot say that this book was an easy read.  I found the sentence structures often awkward, so that it didn't flow, and often there were so many different names of people and places that it was difficult to follow the details.  Despite these difficulties, Dracula was a fascinating character, and since Europe during the middle ages generally interests me, I enjoyed a look at the Balkans during that time and in particular, the battle against Mehmed II.  Even though Dracula was a terrible butcher (with a mind similar to Saddam Hussein's) I found his tactics in that battle fascinating and I found myself rooting for him.

I think it should be required reading in high school so that when young everyone gets an idea of what war is really like. I don't believe a better book could be written about this subject than this one.  He may have remembered some details incorrectly, but who cares.  It isn't a happy book.  I felt like I had been run through the mill every time I had read a few pages.  But I felt like I learned more about what life is all about - more than I can enumerate.

The fly on the wall is fictional character, Minutus, a friend of Nero's.  What I enjoyed was getting to meet Nero, Seneca, St. Paul, and St. Peter and what it was like to see the Druids and the early Christians.  Before I read this book I only knew 4 things about ancient Rome:  that Nero fiddled while Rome burned, that the early Christians were thrown to the lions, that Nero's mother killed her husband so that Nero could become emperor, and that Nero had his male lover's genitals removed and then married him.  This book put all those things in context for me.  At times the reading was a bit slow and difficult to follow, but on the whole I found it an enjoyable and educational experience.  Not as good as I remember &quot;the Egyptian&quot; being, but nevertheless very worthwhile.	2002-09-02

In fact I was saying to myself, \\"Boy, this is a GREAT book!\\"  The second half I found boring.<br />  I bought this out-of-print book because I had read the obit of Ernest Gordon and thus introduced to a bit of what occurred in the prison of war camp.  It seems like if you get within an inch of death and manage to survive, then you get true religion.  This phenomenon interests me and for some reason I like to read about a person's real experiences.  I guess it lessens my fear of death.  When Peter Sellers died and was revived, I recall that he said he would never fear death again.  But when someone tries to extrapolate these experiences into some sort of philosophy it always -in my mind- seems to fall flat.  The purpose of life is to get on with it, no matter how purposeless it seems, but near death experiences seem to help me deal with the getting on with it.	2002-06-20

How classical music manages to convey its ineffable beauty, I don't know, but it does.  This book allows you to place what you are listening to in its place within the whole field of Western classical music.	2001-12-25

Ciardi was a mind-bogglingly brilliant man.  This comes across in this book.  When I want to learn about any subject, I start with the words and their etymologies.  I use this book as one of my references.  Example:  Albania - why is it called that?  I find that 'alb' means 'white', so it tells me that the country has snow covered mountains.  Then, no wonder the white of the egg is called 'albumen', the alps are called such, and the word 'album' means 'white tablet', or an albino is an albino. I guess an albatross must be white.  Looking into word histories tells you about all sorts of things.  Ciardi must have been working indefatigably on this subject, like Pliny and some of those other guys who did so much work for all of us.	2001-12-25

There are lots of books about the theories, but the actual cases always seem much more striking to me.  This book is fun to read if you are interested in looking at these kind of connections.  I wish there were more books about this, but the subject seems to be out of vogue these days although people still have as many psychogenic problems as ever. I don't particularly like the books that make case material like this too artistic and flowery; this book describes the characters to the point.  The examples part of &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot; was also good in the same way.	2001-12-08

And it sounded so interesting in the NYTimes review!  I feel this book is pure garbage.  He seems to be under the impression that every thought and memory which flits through his head is of great value.  Just as power corrupts, fame insufflates the ego - unless you have the supreme wisdom to resist it.  I read halfway thru another book called something like 'the delights of aging'.  It was just as disappointing.  And I'm aging.  Are there any books which genuinely make you believe aging isn't as bad as it feels?  Like that music isn't as bad as it sounds? Maybe self-delusion is the only way to joyfully tolerate the whips and scorns. Maybe that's Mortimer's real message here - message by example.	2001-11-05

Heck, I'm even a member of Mensa.  But though I didn't realize it before, it wasn't until I read this book that I really began to understand what inflation and deflation were.  Somewhere in this book he says, &quot;The government is the counterfeiter&quot;.  I had to think and think for a while about what Harry Browne wrote in this book before I really - I mean REALLY - began to understand what inflation is (and I'm supposed to be intelligent).  It's one of those things - you don't know that you don't understand, until you do understand.  It's like those weird 3D pictures, you don't see them until you see them, and then WOW!  That's what this book did for me.  The book may be dated, but the lessons are eternal.	2001-11-04

I wish we had more books of people who had written about their own lives at that time.  From the perspective of the present time Margery Kempe was kind of a nut - although she didn't realize it - but then maybe her kind was so prevalent in those days, that she wasn't considered to be that weird.  At any rate I found it fun to read and be transported back to that time. Louise Collis' explanations render the book easy to follow.	2001-11-04

This book told me so many things - about salt, butter, corn, etc.  Example: Coca Cola was first made from the coca leaf, which contains cocaine, plus the kola nut.  It was touted as an innocent &quot;soft&quot; drink.  In 1903 the Coca Cola company (without announcement) removed all traces of cocaine. This is one of those books which increases your awareness of the world around you.	2001-11-04

I feel football was the medium for his message and he sent a great message, he was a truly great man.  However, I did not feel this book did him justice.  He wanted his life to serve as an inspiration to young people and it did, but the book missed the boat.  Unfortunately this book will soon be forgotten.  I felt like I had to wade through the dross of panegyrics to find some of the nuggets of true value. Someone must be able to write a inspirational book about this inspiring man.	2001-10-28

I had visited China shortly before reading it and felt everyone should go there as you don't appreciate the society you live in without contrast.  For example, there is an anecdote about a fellow whose wife was sent away by the government and he missed being together with her so much that at dinner he set her place and got into her clothing so as to feel she were still with him.  What this book did for me was make me more aware of how we all are at the mercy of social currents and this awareness enables me to accept my helplessness and helps me to dissipate my anger.  Peace of mind, afforded by knowledge, not ignorance is worth a great deal to me. This book, I found, easy to read and educational.	2001-10-28

That is, until I read about his sighting Yeti towards the end, and then I groaned, &quot;Oh no, why did he have to put this in?&quot;, which is why I took away one star.  Of course some of the story must be distorted because it wasn't until years later that it was written and some of it must have had details aimed at selling thrown in, but I was really glad I read it, in contrast to some books I regret having wasted time on.	2001-10-24

However, the mood is bleak, depressing and one of desolation.  It reminds me of the paintings by Edward Hopper, like &quot;Nighthawks&quot;.  That is my main criticism - the pointlessness of this character's life.  Let me quote a sentence from the book just to give you the flavor: &quot;...notable was his ability to understand...the slithy semaphores of the slugs and worms that moved above and through his earth.&quot;  For me one book by this author is enough.  ('slithy' isn't in my dictionary and I've only heard it in Lewis Carroll's poem 'Jabberwocky')  Life has enough muck and mire as it is, thank you very much.  In my mind, the book doesn't even begin to explain the mind of the skid-row bum.  If it did, that would be an entirely different story.	2001-09-29

I don't doubt that it is factual, although some of the facts may have been disguised to protect her from being identified.  Prior to reading this book I thought that female circumcision was only practiced in some very, very primitive groups in Africa or the South Sea Islands.  Since then I have read more about it, including that it is still practiced by some Muslim families in the USA!  I even met a woman whose mother was going to have it done to her and her older brothers rescued her.  This book makes you think.	2001-09-29

I enjoy learning about language and where our words come from.  So for people who like this sort of thing, they will find this the sort of thing they like.  Examples:  Patella (the medical term for kneecap) in Latin meant 'frying pan' and the food 'paella' comes from the same Latin word.  In France, a cat does not 'purr' but goes 'ron-ron'.  The name of the breed Samoyed, is the name of a Siberian tribe and the name means 'self-eating' because it was thought the tribe was cannibalistic.  The book is filled with this stuff, so I found it great fun to read.  Now if people complain of pain in their kneecap, I think they are complaining of pain in their frying pan.	2001-09-29

I would say that this one by Schechter is a little easier to read, flows better and is better organized.  There is a great deal of overlap, but I was glad I read both.  I liked reading about the Monty Hall problem and about Erdos' getting water all over in the Hoffman book, but Schechter had the conflict with Selberg in his book, which was meaningful to me.  I guess I would recommend reading both.	2001-09-22

When I learn about the things around me, forever after that they look more interesting to me.  This book taught me a great deal about trees and led me to learn more on my own afterwards.

For example his testing the ability of his mind to time something, I try occasionally and find I am very bad at it.  I think he wanted to learn about everything and it was interesting to me that he came across as psychologically blind.  This made me more aware of my own blind spots, such as my inability to see any beauty in a Braque painting, whereas someone I greatly respect can go into ecstasy over them. It was fun to be a fly on the wall allowed to be let in on some aspects of the life of one of the great scientists.	2001-09-08

I read it over 10 years ago and the individuals in the book still come back to my mind occasionally.  This book made me think.  For example, the lady in her 80's who started tooking lasciviously at young men again stands in my mind as a paradigm for how our 'settings' influence the way we see things; the same thing may look beautiful one day and blah the next.  Or the man with the short term memory loss who was shocked when he looked in the mirror made me ponder on how the faculty of memory is necessary for giving us a sense of self.  The book was easy to read and Sacks draws almost schematic representations of these people, but I believe that oversimplification is often necessary in order to make a valid point.	2001-09-08

There was a fair amount of math in the book, so I skipped over those parts.  I enjoyed reading the anecdotes which gave me some insight into this fascinating character.  I don't believe this book was intended to be a piece of great writing, and so it certainly was not that.  Merle Miller's 'Plain Speaking' about H.S.Truman was written much better.	2001-09-01

My children were young when I read it and I felt that it contained many lessons on how to be a good parent. And all in the context of very enjoyable reading. The story about learning to use the horse drawn cultivator shows how a parents help their child develop self-confidence, which is something I see so many people lacking. I can't say enough good things about this gem of a book.	2001-08-27

I bought it because I want to learn to read Chinese and I have to start somewhere. So far I am up to the 100th 'radical' and am finding it very difficult to memorize them. My hope is that eventually they will start to come together, as when putting 'wrong' and 'heart' together, you get the sign for sadness, or 'woman' beneath 'roof' gives you peace. At this point I really don't even know what a radical is. My hope is that knowing the radicals will enable me to look up words in a chinese to english dictionary so I can start translating written chinese.	2001-08-25

It was like living around the year 1000 and being taken on a tour around so you could see how different things were at that time. For example, I learned why the postal system in Europe uses the posthorn as its symbol. I learned where cruelty to children stems from. I learned why caravans were popular. I came to realize more fully why decent women prostituted themselves. And I learned much, much more from being carried back into that time about 1000 years ago.

When I was in college, they said Life magazine was for people who couldn't read and the Readers Digest was for people who couldn't think.  If you don't want to strain your brain and you want the story to float effortlessly from the pages into your brain, this is the novel for you.  As for me, this book is typical of the trash written these days.  I guess it's because I like to read stories which are plausible.  I like to get some insight into the thinking of people who live very differently from me.  But every now and then I enjoy easy trash, although I am not proud of that fact.	2001-08-16
