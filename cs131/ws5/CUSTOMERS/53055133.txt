Perhaps you could use them in conjunction with Michael Moore's book, \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\"  <br />I wonder about those patriots who support the present regime with out thinking things through.  GWB, aka \\"George the Lesser,\\" gained the office of President as the result of a government coup.  <br />He and his henchmen have demolished as much of the previously legislated social, economic and environmental safeguards as they could, and they are not done yet.<br />One of my friends, who is permanently disabled, supports this goon.  She has no idea that the outcome of her support will be the demolishment of the social security safety net for disabled (and other) Americans.  She says that Bush has integrity unlike that of President Clinton.  But \\"W\\" has no concept of what the word \\"integrity\\" means, let alone his much touted phrase \\"corporate integrity.\\"<br />We have not yet seen the depths of depravity these folks will strive for.  And we are probably going to be taken down into poverty while they get insanely super-rich.  Be warned: Prescott Bush financially supported the Nazi's during WWII and his grandson is just a part of that whole element of greed.<br />Just my $1.98.	2004-01-23

There is a thorough index that includes scientific names and common names as well as appendices with checklists of general distributions of fish in the Pacific Northwest and a list of extensive references.<br />Although the title says &quot;Inland Fishes,&quot; be aware that this volume also includes those fish found in estuarine and marine locales, for example the Pleuronectid flat fish &quot;Starry Flounder&quot; a marine fish also found in Puget Sound.  This volume not only includes fish found in Washington State waters, but also the waters of the entire Pacific Northwest, including Alaska, British Columbia and the Yukon--and perhaps Northern California. <br />The section on Species Keys and Life History Accounts is broken down by Family.  Identification information includes: Distinguishing Characteristics, Distribution (with maps), Habits and Habitat, Age and Growth, Reproduction, Food, Remarks and References for each Species<br />I wish that I had access to this volume when I was identifying Cottid and Salmonid fishes, 'way back in the mid-1970's!	2004-01-09

Nothing beats hearing a poet read what he/she  has written.  While I was sitting, waiting for the reading to begin, I  leafed through this volume and run across the poem &quot;Golf Towels.&quot;   Jones coincidentally included this poem in his reading. <br />He described  his father's fascination for discarded golf towels.  His father was at one  time an airline pilot (impetus for Jones' book &quot;Country of Air&quot;),  dissatisfied with his career.  Now, as golf course &quot;Marshall&quot; for  his local course, Jones' father gets great satisfaction in retrieving all  sorts of discarded golf paraphernalia (some by the marshy paths, some in  the trash bins), especially golf towels.  After Jones read this poem, which  included references to four different males named &quot;Andrew&quot; in his  family, I later made the connection of a fifth &quot;Andrew&quot; in the  poem, the golf towel from St. Andrews golf course in Scotland.  This light  blue towel, with a gold crown in the center, was wrapped around Richard's  baby son (Andrew), fresh from a bath, and who was then handed to his  grandfather's arms. (The poem says it so much more eloquently than I can  describe it here.) <br />Besides publishing Jones' newest poems, &quot;The  Blessing&quot; is a collection of four of his earlier books of poetry,  which had been of print.  Not only is it a blessing to read Richard Jones'  newest works, but it is a blessing to once again have in print his older,  equally powerful works, taking measure of the progress of his life.	2000-06-12

Despite the stress, when came to writing the next installment of his series, &quot;The  Cowboys,&quot; he has surpassed his already considerable skill as an author  and given us one fantastic story!  So apparently, he writes well under  pressure.<br />If you are a writer who aspires to become a published author I  suggest you read &quot;Drew&quot; very carefully.  The admonishment for all  writers to &quot;show, don't tell&quot; is demonstrated, if you are unclear  on the meaning of the concept.  Greenwood doesn't say, &quot;Drew felt  angry and betrayed,&quot; he shows it by crafting one of the most powerful  scenes I have ever read, where markswoman Drew just about shoots the hero's  clothes right off his body!  Not only are we taken into the heart and soul  of both the central characters, but we also are immersed in the culture of  the mid to late 1870's and to know more about the itinerant wild west shows  which toured the United States during that time.<br />But I don't want to  forget that Leigh Greenwood also writes with a sense of humor.  There are  moments when I just had to chuckle. I've read all of his &quot;Seven  Brides&quot; and &quot;The Cowboys&quot; series: Greenwood's characters and  stories are memorable, because they are about human beings struggling to  come to terms  with life and love.  I'm not sure I can convey the depths of  feeling that reading this book generated for me, other than to admit that  perhaps I identified with Drew, who could be described as an early  feminist: a woman who struggled to maintain her independence at a time when  society wasn't all that supportive of strong women.<br />This book is a  &quot;keeper!&quot;	2000-06-02

I really enjoyed Sullivan and &quot;Angel.&quot;  Ms. Leto knows how to  develop her characters and show you what's going on inside their hearts and  minds. (The author's rule of thumb: &quot;show, don't tell&quot; is often  the main nemesis of the writer, both beginner and &quot;old hand&quot;.)   The motivation behind the love making is plausible and not gratuitous, if  you know what I mean.  (I really don't enjoy reading about characters who  jump in the sack immediately after they have just met. To me, it seems  contrived.  Or, my sense is they are really only in it for the sex, and not  the love.) Sullivan and Angel have that spark of love, and I enjoyed  reading about them.  They are caring and loving towards one another.  <br />I  had no idea that this was Ms. Leto's first book!  I was going to look for  her earlier titles so I could read what I'd missed!

Elizabeth Bevarly knows how to take the rule &quot;author's  should not repeat words in the same vicinity,&quot; and make it screamingly  hilarious.

He discusses the magical properties of the different types of water, herbs, herbal combinations, and tools, such as eggs and mothballs, which can be used to remove negative energies and establish energy screens for psychic protection.  Included are spells and other formulas that you can use to focus your intent to increase positivity and abundance in your life and surroundings. Included are recipes for baths, incense mixtures, and floor washes.  This may be the only book to my knowledge that collects this type of information in one place.  I have used many of the procedures myself. For example, I used the &quot;egg procedure&quot; (where you rub an egg all over the body of your pet, and then flush the uncracked egg down the toilet) to remove negative &quot;vibes&quot; from my cats to lighten up their attitudes about a new home to which we had moved).  I found the principles of cleansing and protection for the various methods described by the author to be both easy to do and quite effective in their results.  Mickaharic does emphasize repeatedly throughout the book, that it is *not* wise to improvise any of the methods and components (such as herbs) described in the book, without completely understanding the magical implications, meanings and intent of each part of the spell.  It is my guess that the author is from Eastern Europe based on his knowledge of traditional herbal floor washes and fumigation recipes to keep one's home environment psychically purified.	1998-06-29

She is eager to claim her life as her own, and transform Mauna Noe, the cattle ranch which she anticipates to inherit for herself and Hadley, into a thriving productive cattle ranch.  Little does she know of Franklin's vindictive plans set in his will.  When Spencer Laamea, a hapa Haole, half Hawaiian man (who turns out to be Franklin's illegitimate son), shows up at the reading of the will, Elizabeth is shocked at her primal reaction to Spence's physical appearance (he first reminds her of Franklin, and she is therefore apprehensive), then his beauty (this man is very handsome and she is strongly attracted) and lastly, his strong, grounded presence (and she feels comforted). Together, they heal each other and Hadley as they work together to revitalize Mauna Noe.  Elizabeth comes to trust her own strength, her inner knowingness, and her love for Spence and the Land.  She comes to know that Spence is an honorable man.  Spence heals the bitterness he had nursed all those years when Franklin abandoned both Spence's Hawaiian Mother and Spence himself. Through Elizabeth, Spence learns the truth about his Father's brutality.  Hadley blossoms into a healthy, light-hearted, loving young woman as she grows to love and trust Spence as a father-figure and becomes friends with the Hawaiians on the ranch.<br />The attitudes about race and interracial relationships that underpin the story in this book connected me to a story my Father told me about his growing up.  Dad's parents were in the Navy, stationed on Guam around 1925, when he was 10 or 11.  He said his favorite activity was body surfing on the beaches with his buddies, the Island boys.  He recalled that his Mother was called in to the base Commandant's office and told to keep her son from playing with the &quot;native boys,&quot;  because it wasn't &quot;seemly.&quot;  I remember my Dad looking both sad and angry at his memory, because, he went on to say, &quot;Those were the only friends I had.&qu! ot;  Glass Beach takes place in an era when the description, &quot;going native,&quot; was seen as a moral step down in the social scheme of things.<br />I especially enjoyed learning about the Paniolos, the Hawaiian cowboys, and appreciated Landis' use of Hawaiian words throughout the book.  Her descriptions of the Land and people and the love the people have for the Land had me right there on Kauai, and I've never visited there before.  Maybe now is the time?!	1998-05-26

However, it is her Basque roots that have given her entry into the shaman's world.  The Basque tradition is very mystical in that they draw power from their appreciation of the ordinary world to accomplish extraordinary things.  <br />Ms. Arrien respects the teachings of indigenous peoples; their respect for Mother Earth and their awareness of the relationship of everything to  all of its parts.  Nothing is separate, hence the phrase, &quot;All our relations.&quot;    She has found that each of the four cardinal directions of the Medicine Wheel has something to teach us as we progress through life.  The Medicine Wheel she shares with the reader is a creation cycle, and links power animals, the mystical Elements, musical instruments or tools,  and the modes of meditation and healing which are appropriate for each direction.  We begin in the North, &quot;The Way of the Warrior,&quot; the place of the Leader, where we SHOW UP and take a stand and choose to be present. We then move to the East, The Way of the Visionary, the place of the Seer, where we TELL THE TRUTH about what works and doesn't work for us.  Then, we move to the South, the Way of the Healer, the place of the Lover, and PAY ATTENTION to what has Heart and Meaning for us. And then we move to the West, The Way of the Teacher, the place of Wisdom, where we LET GO OF EXPECTATIONS, and yet are open to what we do receive.  Then we begin the cycle again, refining as we go.  Each direction has an energy of its own, and if we leave any part out, the cycle falls apart. <br />I have found Ms. Arrien's principles as described in this book to be very practical in my professional (I am a librarian) and personal life.  I have healed issues about my own confidence and  leadership abilities and even received a promotion because I first decided to SHOW UP at work and later followed through with the rest of the places on the Wheel!  I use the Wheel to assist me as I go through my day.  I have used Ms. Arrien's highly effective guided meditations to heal personal wounds as well. I have taken what I learned and written about my meditative experiences in my daily journal to expand and go deeper. As a result of working with this book, my life has gotten more fun, more creative and more responsible.  I find it easier to shift my energy instead of getting stuck in assumptions or past expectations, or other people's energy patterns.  There is imaginative artwork and poetry and amazing information.  This book shows us how we can bridge  and connect to our natural mystical nature  (we are all psychic, you know) and trust the knowledge that is easily available, believe it or not, to all us.  A must read for those on the mystical or metaphysical path.	1998-04-29

Not knowing what to expect, I found well-written descriptions with lots of details (historically accurate) about daily life in the 18th century, and well-drawn characters.  <br />I admire Alpin's strength and sense of humor.  She knows when to pick her battles, and never loses sight of her goal to reclaiming her home plantation, &quot;Paradise&quot;, in the Barbados.  However, somewhere in the process of tricking Malcolm Kerr, now her guardian (as she is an unmarried woman without family to protect her), she realizes that her sense of &quot;home&quot; has re-transferred to Kildalton Castle on the Scottish borderlands, and the Kerr family, who had befriended her when she was but an orphan wee girl.  Her plans don't include falling in love with Malcolm, her childhood friend and nemesis.<br />I enjoyed the historical details, the connections with Bonnie Prince Charlie, and the humorous by-play between Saladin, Malcolm's master-at-arms and friend, and Alpin's Black lady-in-waiting, Elanna.	1998-04-06

A villian in the earlier books, Nicholas Carlucci has just been released from a 5-year prison term.  He had hoped that he could have broken Jimmy Falcone's New Orleans crime ring, but all that happened was Falcone walked free and Nick went to prison.  Lanie Farrell is an FBI agent sent to protect Nicholas from Falcone's promise to kill him in retribution for his betrayal.  Lanie's problem is she can't tell Nicholas the truth, since he doesn't want any protection from anyone, not caring whether he lives or dies.  What Lanie doesn't know is Nicholas has a secret motivation for all of his years working as Falcone's crooked attorney. She is supposed to &quot;stick to him like glue,&quot; but neither of them has counted on falling in love. <br /> Marilyn Pappano has a good ear for dialog.  Her characters sound like real people. I laughed and cried as I watched them struggle through their healing processes: Nicholas to heal his bitterness about his childhood abandonment and pain of losing his first true love, and Lanie to come to terms with her mother's suicide and her father's callousness.  I read romance novels to learn better ways for me to be in relationship with people, and how to really connect.  What I learned reading &quot;Knight Errant,&quot; is that it is important to never quit loving the people I care about. I also enjoyed vicariously visiting New Orleans.  I could visualize &quot;The Quarter,&quot; and almost smell the humidity.  After I read this one, I HAD to go and find the rest of the series!	1998-04-06

Crosby is ready to &quot;dish the dirt&quot; on everyone, including Rockwell's widow. Dylan expects that is Abigale O'Hurley Rockwell (Abby to her friends) is as conniving and selfish as his ex-wife, and anticipates that Abby will tell only lies for her own financial advantage.  Little does he know that Abby is a strong, practical woman who has raised her two sons as a single mom for most of their lives, with little or no financial or emotional support, especially from her mother-in-law. (Since Abby lives in a rural area of Virginia, she has invited Dylan to stay in a guest room of her farmhouse while he conducts his in depth interviews with her.) Abby had led a sheltered life before she married at eighteen and realized early on in her marriage to Chuck, that she had only her own inner strength and innate practicality to rely upon, because Chuck just wasn't there for her or her children. Dylan can't believe that Abby is really as she appears.  He knows that she is hiding something, but before he discovers information that is potentially harmful, he grows to appreciate Abby's sons Ben and Chris as well as Abby herself. He learns that sometimes the truth can be destructive if used irresponsibly, which is a whole new experience and realization for him. Dylan was considered to be &quot;hard nosed&quot; and compassionless before he met Abby. Both Dylan and Abby are healed by the the truth that is uncovered and the love they share.<br /> Nora Roberts does it again.  I used to believe that prolific writers in a genre could be stuck in a rut, writing the same story and characters repeatedly.  I assumed Nora Roberts might be in that category, but after reading many of her novels, I am convinced otherwise.  She is a fantastic storyteller.	1998-03-23

Acting is actually a strenuous profession, both physically and psychologically, not easy and self indulgent as most people assume stardom to be. [This is one of the &quot;O'Hurley Series&quot; about a theatrical family.] <br />Chantal O'Hurley is a well-known film star who is wise, strong and beautiful.  She has known her whole life what she wants to accomplish and has gone for her goals with clear and realistic expectations. She is aware of her impact on her audience and those with whom she associates, working diligently to have a reputation as a responsible and cooperative actress, and is well aware that she is only part of the movie-making team.  She understands the personal vulnerability she has as a star, but has never anticipated that anyone close to her could and would consider stalking her.  <br />At the recommendation of her agent, Chantal hires Quinn Dolan, private investigator for her personal security.  Quinn and Chantal try to maintain a businesslike relationship, but as time goes along, Quinn becomes aware that Chantal's beauty is more than skin deep.  It comes from her innermost being (which is the source she draws upon for her acting talent); a deep appreciation of life.  Chantal, on her side, comes to know that Quinn is more than the tough guy persona seen at first glance.  He is perceptive and compassionate,  and draws this strength from within himself as well.  <br />Nora Roberts has done her homework here.  She puts the reader right into the environment.  The details of filmaking, acting and the theatre world ring true.  I found myself &quot;right there&quot; on the soundstage, as if I was by the camera (if not in front of it).  I have found that I better not start reading one of Roberts' novels if I plan on reading myself to sleep, because I get so involved that I can't stop myself from turning the pages, reading &quot;just one more chapter&quot;until I'm finished, often into the very early morning! This book is just one more example of the power and intensity of her writing.	1998-03-19

Ms. Greene combines inventiveness with tradition.  I used this book as one of my resources for compiling a menu for a Passover Seder twelve years ago.  My friend Barbara Podell was taking a closer look at her Jewish heritage (she had been raised Episcopalian, but her paternal grandparents were Russian Jews) and we became &quot;co-caterers&quot; for what has become THE spiritual and social event of the year for our family of friends. <br /> Since I am not Jewish, but I wanted to be as authentic and Kosher as possible, I was happy that Gloria included historical background and symbology for the Seder plate and for traditions behind both Ashkenasic and Sephardic foods, such as the &quot;Long Roasted Eggs,&quot; which our friends look forward to each year as a very special part of our Seder (which we call &quot;dinner with a script&quot;).  Before reading her book, I didn't know about Sephardic Jews and the differences in the ingredients they use. <br /> Gloria writes with a friendly tone and a light touch, which I found encouraging since I was neophyte to Jewish cooking styles. <br /> If you have to pick only one book, this is the ONE!	1998-03-11

As I was reading, I appreciated that Frazier had chosen just the right phrase from each chapter as the title for that chapter.  I learned that one can be familiar with the &quot;landscape of violence&quot; and not let it destroy your heart.   <br />    In response to one of the other reader-reviewer's comments about the evil that pervades this book and that men are shown to be  bad, and women are good: not all the women were good (remember the scene where Inman is drugged and given to the Guard).  My sense is that violence was just a normal part of living at that time and not thought of as evil.  For example paddling in school or beatings or whippings as conventional punishment were acceptable and widely practiced, so I would suggest we judge &quot;good and bad&quot; behavior within the context of the times.  For example, I recall watching some of the same harshness of attitude in the film &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot;  I know it wasn't right, but it was considered to be &quot;normal and usual.&quot; Life was tough back then, and I think it was because society expected it to be tough. <br />   My step-grandmother's maiden name was &quot;Inman.&quot;  Maybe they were related.	1998-02-11

Rachel and her son Edward are almost over the edge of survival. Because she refuses to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer, and meets her challenges with courage (because she has nothing to lose), Rachel and Edward both receive (in the end) everything they have dreamed about having--and more.  People in real life have a habit of expecting every relationship to end badly, if that has happened to them in the past.  Rachel and Gabe both took risks to really know and appreciate each other, and that was how they healed their personal wounds to enable them to be in relationship, first, individually (learn to love him/her self), and then to love each other.      I have been reading romance novels for about a year and a half, and have been healing my own wounds and assumptions about relationships, though it's not what most people would consider to be &quot;therapy.&quot;  Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of the best writers of this genre around.  Last year, when I finished &quot;Nobody's Baby But Mine,&quot; I was shocked to see that I needed to wait a year for her next book!  I feel the same way today.  My best friend said she didn't enjoy this one as much, but I think that's because Dream A Little Dream is different: more tension/anxiety and a more hazardous situation.	1998-02-06
