Perhaps she made good choices with her career, but her personal life was one dumb decision after another. While I felt sorry for the predicaments she got into, I also thought she did a huge disservice to herself and her daughter by becoming a bystander in her life. If the old hollywood interests you this will be a great book, but be ready to want to shake O'Hara a few times.	2005-06-16

While her interest in frequently accentuating words in ALL CAPS is odd at first, once you get used to it, it becomes more like when a friend puts her hand on your arm to emphasise her point during conversation.<br /><br /> The story of Dot reflects much of the malaise in society, and matter of factly and amusingly incorporates some taboo stuff such as infidelity, porno flicks, murder, vivisection and incest. Ellman also has a knack of gettting into tangents, or at least the first seem like tangents, but their power is likly very calucalated. I found her cheeky tirade on What if Animals Did This to You? (where she invites the reader to imagine if animals treated us as we treat them) to be especially amusing.<br /><br /> if you want something cooky, a little bit naughty and very unusual, then this book is or you.	2004-07-24

His inclusion of magazines like Scoot! Quarterly and a list of scooter clubs will make many new scooterists feel more at ease about joining the scootering scene.  The book also contains lots of interesting photos.<br />Yet, there are many errors. For example, there are quite a few simple errors such as references to incorrect page numbers. One caption lists an illustration as being from the 50's when it was actually created by a current, practicing artist. In his history of Vespa, the author confuses the founder of Piaggio with his son. I list these as examples of how the book escaped some critical editing and thorough fact checking.<br />If you are a scootering enthusiast, you may find this book lacking. If you are interested in getting into scootering and don't know much about it, you may find this book to be inspiring and welcoming.  Amazon has it at a good price, so its worth adding to your collection.	2004-06-25

I felt that many of the characters and situations seemed contrived to be shocking and gripping, but the effort to create them rather than tell their stories, seemed too evident. Some stories were interesting, but a few were downright annoying.<br />I give it 2 stars, but feel 2 1/2 is more appropriate, considering I think Schickler uses some good  language. He just needs to send his characters through a plausibility checker.	2003-01-12

I found this book to be very interesting, keeping be engaged through all 320 pages. Ducovny's characters are al slightly off center and keep you wondering what will happen next. The sadness of a young man who finds he is stradling between a boy who races steam ships on his bicycle and a young man who is figuring out his sexuality and own identity.  many of the characters are people you would not want to know , but all have compelling lives.<br />I was not expecting the amount of sexuality in the book. I wasn't offended by the amount or type of sexual scenarios, but I found that the characters seemed to lack any real passion, abhorance or lasting interest in the sexual situations, which struck me as odd.<br />All in all I give it a 4-star rating for its sad stroy, unusual cast of characters and gutsy ending.	2003-01-12

The designs have great style, but seem totally achievable. Using this book as a guide and source of inspiration you could decorate your home in a comfortable yet stylish manner. Some of the pieces they show are pricey, while others are probably inexpensive flea market finds. The author gives you enough information that you could go out into the flea markets and antique/second hand shops and make some sound purchase. It is a shame the book is less than 200 pages. I would have loved to see more.	2002-06-14

I often found myself craving a simple, yet savory noodle dish but never knew how to make any. Nor did I know what to buy as I stood, glaze-eyed in front of the Asian food section in the market. This book has solved my problems by providing easy and tasty recipes that don't contain a bunch of unusual ingredients. In a quick trip to the local market I was able to pick up everything I neded for a very yummy &amp; quick dinner. The photos are mouth-watering and will get you inspired.<br />One drawback is that the recipes do not contain nutritional stats. Another is that although there are over 50 recipes, I still would like the book to be a little longer.	2002-06-14

He is infinitely clever and can master children's books, short stories and erotic novellas. This book is a great example of how crafty he can be with adult subject matter. This is not a book for children, as it deals with sexual matters throughout.<br />\\"My Uncle Oswald\\" is a rollicking story of how a shrewd businessman made his fortune off of powerful men and their enflamed sexual desires. The female character of the beautiful Yasmin Howcomely is a great example of an intelligent and self-aware lady who uses her brains and looks to get somewhere. The book is pure comedy from beginning to end and highlights how Dahl can make any subject funny. If you have enjoyed his short stories, you'll enjoy this short book.<br />If you aren't prudish, love witty yet accessible writing and have a few spare hours on your hands, you'll love this book. It is short enough for a cross-country flight or a few nights pre-bedtime reading.	2002-04-09

Dan Starkey is a regular guy with typical vices. When a drunken night results in  some poor choices and even poorer outcomes, he has to muddle through a murder mystery. He's no Hercule Poirot and makes a few mistakes, but his brains and heart make up for what he lacks.<br />Dan is a likeable character with a realistic and humorous approach to life. Landing himself in the middle of a Northern Ireland political scandal is not in his plan, but the reader can see how this everyman deals with the situation. The Ireland issue is quite pivotal. As an American totally in the dark about this conflict, it was interesting to read about it, even in fiction.<br />There are several murders in this book, but none are very gorey.Bateman's writing is funny and honest. He has wit, but avoids sounding as if he is throwing it in your face.  This book would be great for a long plane ride or as  an addition to your summer reading list.	2002-03-08

Savage will answer any question for the sake of education. For this alone, you'll read his responses to questions you already know the answers for. This book even had a few questions that would never have occured to me to ask!<br />I recommend it for anyone who is curious about sexuality, loves a good laugh and is mystified by the silliness of other human beings. He gives good advice that you'll pass onto your friends, even if it is with a laugh.	2002-01-31

I am a publicist who has represented authors and companies. I bought the book looking for information that would give me an understanding of specifics that are unique to music industry publicity. While this book provided a little of that information, I found it more helpful to confer with other music industry publicists, instead. This book does give you basics on what to include in your press kit and how to find some media contacts.<br />The book is obviously dated and could use with a revision, especially in the technology area, which has revolutionized how publicity is done. If you are a complete beginner, this book can be helpful, but you will need a lot more to launch a truly successful campaign.	2002-01-29

This book explores the relationships of opposites. The late-twenties protagonist is a barely making it retail gal in upper-class Neiman's while her romantic interest is a AARP millionaire who still hasn't learned how to relate to women. Each character is in transition and the story intersects with their lives during one of these points.<br />Martin's writing style is filled with sensitivity and keen observation which make it a treat to read. He views his characters from multiple angles and regards them fairly. One of the most entertaining passages is when the older Ray Porter is explaining to Mirabelle that he wants a no-strings-attached relationship Martin intersperses this conversation with a  He Said/She Said version which shows the reader how each characters says one thing that is heard differently by the other.<br />&quot;Shopgirl&quot; is a short book, perfect for decompressing from a long trip, a tough weekend or for your next book after reading a particularly long book. The only other fiction I had read of his was &quot;Cruel Shoes&quot; which I also found entertaining.	2002-01-29

Since I decided that I should read more classics this year, I picked up this book. Since the film should be releases soon, I figured I should read it before seeing the film might ruin it for me.<br />That being said, this book was an exceptional story, and lives up to the acclaim.  Rather than recount the plot,  I will give a few reasons for my 4-star rating. The action begins immediately. While some books walk into the story, this book has significant plot development in the first few pages. Contrary to my preconception, there was really no fighting in the book. The action comes as the Count's intricate plan of revenge unfolds. Dumas does a great job of combining narration with introspection. While unraveling the plot, he provides insight into the emotions and personalities of his characters. In addition, the book isn't mired by excessive language. All in all this is a great story that should appeal to both men and women.  I was able to read all 508 pages in a week of leisurely reading.<br />On a negative point, this specific edition  contains numerous typographical errors. Somone favored the letter \\"A\\" over \\"S\\" and many words are misspelled. If that is important to you, I would suggest you try another edition.	2002-01-26

But, I was hoping for a few I hadn't and a decent narrations. However, this book blew me away. I have purchased photograph-focused books on celebritites before and been disappointed by their flimsy commentary. This book does an excellent job of conecting the photos to Ms. Hayworth's life. It's not just a collection of pictures, it's a pictorial  biography. Admittedly, a traditional bio would get into greater detail, but this book is a great intro to her life. Not everyone wants a tell-all book filled with intimate details. This book delivers impeccably reproduced photos and a satisfactory bio. At first I was a little put-off by the price, but I feel it was well worth it, after reading it. A great read for anyone interested in this arrestingly beautiful and glamourous woman.	2002-01-11

I like quirky, unusual stories that poke fun at the establishment and make me laugh. I was in the mood for such a book and lucked out when I read &quot;Miss Wyoming.&quot; The story was thoroughly entertaining. While it may seem like a no-brainer to make fun of a beauty queen and her white-trash mom, Coupland keeps you entertained with a chain of events that is anything but predictable. He knows that these characters could and probably do exist, but the combination of all these weirdos in one book and the journey they take is laugh-out-loud funny. No one takes themselves too seriously, a keen point which keeps the story fresh. The characters know they have foibles, personality quirks and such, but they face life and deal with it with results that are fun to watch from the sidelines.  His writing is clear and keeps the momentum going. It was a perfect book to read before bed or while sitting in the sunshine.	2002-01-11

So, years later, I picked up this book of short stories. Since &quot;Winters Night&quot; is really a collection of related short stories, I expected ,uch the same. UNfortunately, I didn't like it as much. This book represents a real cross-section of his work. I found that most of his political allegories were a little too heavy for me. What I found most interesting were the stories that focused on relationships. Mother to son, lover to lover, friend to friend. This is where I was most interested. Since I seem to prefer Calvino in certain types of fiction, this may not have been the best collection for me. If you are a fan of Calvino &amp; are looking for a good overview, this book may be better for you.	2001-10-14

The brief, one-page descriptions get to the heart of each director's significance. One still from each director's work exemplifies the point the author is making.<br />These descriptions made me want to seek out films by the directors. I am very interested in researching some of the lesser known ones in the book, based on the author's observations. This book looks at film as an art form and gives a glimpse at each director's personal style and contribution to the art form.<br />However, if you are looking for an in-depth study or a pop-culture overview, the brevity may leave you wanting. What you won't get is a complete survey of their careers, or lots of sensational stories. Those are best left to tell-tale bios and tabloids. This book is strictly about the art and artists. Highly recommended.	2001-07-12

However, I felt that the narrator's voice was tiresome and uninteresting. His take on being an appreciator of beauty wore thin on me. Even with a mild deformity, he was uninteresting.  I figured out the story line ahead of time and felt nothing about any of the characters. I wasn't expecting an erotic novel, but I was hoping to get what the book jacket advertised, &quot;the wit of Wilde, the sublimity of Poe.&quot;  It didn't even come close. Save your money or look elsewhere for something more engaging. Sorry.	2001-07-12

Since I am not acquainted with her, the brevity of the book encouraged me to take a chance. After reading about her life &amp; the various stages during which she wrote her books, I am more encouraged to pick up one of her works.<br />Nigel Nicolson obviously has an admiration for Virginia Woolf, as she was one of his mother's lovers, and a family friend, but I believe the tone of the book to be fair. He frankly discusses her shortcomings and her highlights. I would recommend this for anyone interested in learning more about thsi influential artist. It would be an excellent read for a high school literature class that is looking for the person behind the name of Virginia Woolf.	2001-07-12

I read his children's story books as a child, but was re-introduced to him accidentally as I stumbled upon a different short story collection. I tore through it immediately and loved it. I happened upon this book &amp; noticed that it had quite a few stories that I had not read. This collection is more comprehensive than others I have seen. It even contains some of his more sexually explicit works (although they aren't that explicit by today's standards.) Each story is a perfectly timed twist that keeps you guessing. I rarely can guess the outcome of his stories, which is a testament to his ability to tell a story without giving it away.  I recommend this collection for anyone with an appreciation for the slightly twisted who wants a thorough introduction to his &quot;adult&quot; works. Also good for teens who are ready for something kind of edgy but not trashy. The stories are funky, but entirely appropriate for a read before bedtime.	2001-07-12

A probable alcoholic, Claudia has let her life stagnate in a roach-infested apartment, working as a secretary and ghostwriter for a greulling boss with an inflated sense of self-importance, while she secretly pines for her best friend. Her life is a mess and she has made little effort to ameliorate any of the troubling aspects, chosing to drink what mnoney she has left and engage in a nowhere affair with a married poet.<br />In the back of her head, Claudia knows that most of this situation is within her control. As the book progresses, she begins to see what she needs to do to extricate herself from her rut. Although her concerns are run-of-the-mill (i.e. hates her job, wants the boy, has no money etc...) How she navigates these problems is unique, with some slightly amusing twists.<br />I give this book a 3 as I feel that some of the incidents that come up in the book aren't as seriuous as she portrays them.  This book would be good for an airplane ride or some summer reading in a lounge chair. The NY Times called it &quot;a breezy and confident first novel&quot; with which I totally agree.	2001-05-28

His ability to convey in 101 words what would take many writers several paragraphs is impressive. I laughed out loud to many of the stories and even read a few aloud to a friend. The only drawback is that the stories all focus on dysfunctional relationships often with a cruel and unloving girlfriend as the subject, so the stories began to grate when read together. I figured that out early and decided to only read a few stories before bed. Much better approach and much funnier when taken in small bits.	2001-05-15

Ms.Gordon lived a life filled with famous actors, globe-trotting and a true love of the theater. Although I don't agree with all of her life choices, her book is a peek at a life lived by few. Unapologetic and footed in reality, the book covers her life from young child until shortly before her death.  I imagine it would be a great read for anyone who is especially interested in the theater from the first part of the 20th century. Ms. Gordon rattles off the names of many plays, actors, writers and directors,  most of which I didn't know. She doesn't explain much to put them in context, so I think someone who is more familliar with that era would get a greater kick out of it. <br />If youonly know her from &quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; or &quot;Where's Pappa?&quot; check out the long history of this lady of the stage.	2001-05-15

Regardless, the book is very entertaining and simple to understand. I'm not really interested in the specifics of physics or math, but I am interested in the humanity behind science which is exactly what you get with this book. It gives an interesting, logical, background of the history behind this famous equation. Amusing anecdotes give the book some humor and relevence.

While I'm amazed at Gunn's lack of morals, his unconscionable acts and his self-inflicted circumstances, the tragic comedy of the story was endearing, for lack of a better word. This story wasn't drudgery. In another author's hands, it would have been tiresome and exhausting to read through this odd and foreign life. Coupled with the sadness of watching this train-wreck of a life unfold, is plenty of comedy and entertaining incidents. I can honestly say that this is the best story I have ever read that humorously, yet honestly tells how addiction and emotional handicap are a recipe for disaster.<br />I also liked his whole wonderment with toys from the past. Now that I'm just into my 30s, I've developed similar interests in the toys and kooky widgets that I had as a kid, or never was able to get. I think may adults can see parts of themselves in the issues that Gunn is dealing with (although I hope we all emerge much more unscathed than he). Take this book for a read, but be prepared for a less-than-idyllic life.	2001-03-01

I had no idea about how many cool vintage record covers were out there.<br />The book focuses on covers from 1940-1960. You'll find many jazz, swing and vocalists represented here. The reproductions are excellent and the variety is impressive. While most covers are reproduced in 3x3inches, quite a few are refresented as full pages which is about a 9-inch square. It is organized by artist and record company, showing you how the artist's style influenced the cover.<br />I highly recommend it for record collectors, vintage enthusiasts, graphic designers/illustrators and those who love old things. It made me miss the 12-inch vinyl covers all the more and has inspired me to track specific albums down. CDs can never match the emotional connection that vinyl did.	2001-02-21
US	52725283	RNJL23788OCPN	0316286850	212807922	Making Faces	Books	4	16	19	N	N	Great inspiration!	This book is a great addition to your bedroom bookshelf. You may not use it every day, but it's there when you need it. Mr. Aucoin shows you how you can transform yourself with makeup.He uses before/after photos and tells you what each of his models (young, old, black, white, asian, even men) should focus on.<br />Many of us have the tried &amp; true, day-in/day-out routine. This book gives you some great ideas on how to break out of the mundane and add some variety and interest into your makeup.<br />His ability to turn celebrities like Lisa Marie Presley, Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow and others into completely different looking people should inspire any reader to try something new.<br />In a fit of desperation, before a formal event, I grabbed this book for some ideas. I dug around my makeup collection and found the ingredients to try one of his looks. With his step-by-step directions &amp; illustrations, I was able to totally recreate a more engaging treatment. When my boyfriend picked my up, he looked at me with this surprised look in his eyes. &quot;I can tell by your face; you hate my makeup don't you?&quot; I said. &quot;No. Not at all, it's just so different. So Sexy.&quot; He responded.<br />'Nuff said.	2001-02-21

Although I don't own my own house, I hope that when I do, I can create my own little hideaway in the backyard. A writer's den, potting shed, a quiet place to think. The houses in this book show that square footage doesn't equal endearment.<br />Each house is coupled with a short description, diagrams of how it is built and its completed layout.	2001-02-06

It is subtitled &quot;Scandal and Sensation in Turn-of-the-Century New York&quot; and delivers on that promise.<br />The various stories portray Americans of that time as confused, misguided and self-centered in their disregard for the poor and unempowered (including animals) around them. It deals with warped senses of money, ..., power and charity. Even the newspapers seem to lack objectivity and sanity.<br />Dunlop's book is well-footnoted and the sources are surprisingly robust. I see that some reviewers have taken her to task for her accuracy. Since, I am no scholar of these times, I cannot make a statement as to the accuracy, but I can say that I found the book to be engaging.<br />This isn't the boring, lifeless history we learn in school. It presents the flesh and psychology of the times and makes me wonder what other nations, other people were like at that time.<br />It is an interesting companion to works by Edith Wharton, which hint at the sad and dysfunctional society that pervaded turn-of-the-century America. I wish that this type of history would have been made available to me when I was younger.<br />My only reservation is that every story in this book casts a negative shadow on US society. You might want to balance this with a book that has a more positive view of these times. I would actually give this 3.5 stars.	2001-02-06
US	52725283	R3KX3LSSJVMVKL	0156439611	466126836	If on a Winter's Night a Traveler	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Entertaining and engaging	&quot;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler&quot; is one of the most original and engaging books I have read. Like the title, the books is a group of unfinished stories bound together by one continuous story. The protgonist is desperate to finish the book he has, but finds that each successive copy he gets has a different story that ends abruptly as if there were pages missing. This resembles the magic realism of Marquez (except that Calvino's protagonist has a more plausible story) or the outlandish stories of Kafka, except that Calvino's outlook is romantic and positive. While the idea of a book with a bunch of unfinished stories seems to be torture to read, Calvino keeps it together (and the reader engrossed) with his delicate and readable style.<br />When I read some of the simple and uninteresting fiction that I come across, lately, I think of Calvino's unusual little book and think there is still hope for creativity and imagination.	2000-10-18

McCabe has a cast of oddballs with unusual stories. However, I fond myself re-reading sentences frequently because of his tangents and run-ons. While I can appreciate the conversational manner of characters, I found the style to be overkill that took away from my reading.<br />On the plus side, the stories were funny and unexpected. None were predictable and many were downright outrageous. I especially liked the last (and longest) of the stories which involved a beautiful and selfless young nurse-in-training who becomes an outlaw submissive lesbian.<br />McCabe has a fine imagination that incorporates some of the underbelly of society with a lightheartedness that not many authors can do. He is reminiscent of Vonnegut in his ability to create entertaining, unusual stories, but Vonnegut reads effortlessly, which, unfortunately, isn't the case with this book.<br />Three stars, but streamlined language would have made it four.	2000-10-17

While I find myself in the same place in life as the main character Elizabeth, I was unable to form a bond with her or did I have much admiration for her. Her narration is analytical, but I felt that if she had figured out half as much as she boasted about her life, she would have made some better choices.  While I wholly support self-directed women who work towards what they want, I found that Elizabeth was not the kind of person I would want to be. I admired her ability to find the honesty in sex, but I felt that she wasn't using the knowledge she found to the best of her ability.<br />Quite a few times, I found myself scanning ahead because I was a little tired of her going on about her philosophies and wanted to get to some definitive action. I was about 3/4 of the way into the book when I realized that nothing major was going to happen. I think I was expecting a story that happened in hollywood to have a little more going on. At the end I asked myself, &quot;What happened in this story that was so important that I chose to read it over any other book?&quot; and I can honestly say that nothing really important did happen. To agree with a previous reviewer, it was light reading, although I wouldn't say &quot;trashy.&quot; There is a lot trashier out there.	2000-09-26

While I was  able to follow the directions simply, as all the files were there, I felt  that it wouldn't translate as easily when I began my site, since I was  starting from scratch &amp; wouldn't have the luxury of pre-prepared  graphics, text and design. This book is a tutorial, so it lacks the  inspiration and advice that another sort of book would offer. For Web  design I prefer something more conversational.	2000-06-21

Sometimes, I stumble with a book and never get back into it. I did finish this  book over the course of a month. A few times a week, I would pick it up before going to bed. Yet, it wasn't one of those books that I would tear  through in an evening. My gauge of a good book is to consider if I think  the stories and lessons learned will stay with me. I don't think that I'll  reflect on the characters or stories much in the future. I kept with the  story, but would have rather got it from the library than pay the full  hardback price.	2000-06-21
