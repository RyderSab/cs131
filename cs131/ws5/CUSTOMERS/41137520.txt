His 1935 or so escape from Czech-Republic in a coffin with a dead Golem (no translation offered who this weirdo is and why) made me read on. The pair in the box wasn't stopped by the Reichssicherheitsdienst; they were probably not more on the ball than Homelandsecurity is nowadays, I was withering on the vine of boredom and at page 200 I quit; 400 pages short of the end, never met Houdini or Tesla and other Ausbrecher. The author must have won the Pullitzer-Prize in a sweepstake. Give me a break! Gerborg	2005-10-09

Jones account most enlightening about the era of slavery in the United States. Surely he must have researched the subject, and he writes a story without fault finding, just matter of factly as his very interesting characters acted out in life. The story is not linear, he jumps around, and I found that way of writing unusual but not disturbing. The author has a fine gift for observation and that made the scenes become very vivid. Not one page was boring to me. The details fascinated me.	2005-10-03

Big mistake! Her tome of 642 pages in extremely small and pale print (greed of her publisher Little Brown Time Warner Book Company - let me make a mental note not to publish with those misers)is hard on the eyes and not worth suffering through endless pages of boredeom. Who does she think Vlad the Impaler was? It took her seven years of wasting ink to come up with less than I or a schoolboy know about Vlad the Impaler? The Nuremberg copperplate engravings of Count Dracula dining under a multitude of impaled victims are no secret. In childhood he was given hostage to the Turks or Ottomans by his own father where as a young boy in solitary confinement he developed his trait of cruelty. Perhaps she forgot to mention that historical morsel in her endless seven years of outpouring banalities. She doesn't even know how to handle the first person: sometimes it is her story, sometimes it is her fathers'. Frustrating to read. A clear story line is painfully absent, repetition, repetition, repetition notorious, and there is a total lack of suspense. I was in Istanbul in 1967, certainly did not find her idyllic description \\"everywhere I looked I saw men in dark vests and small crocheted caps, women in brightly printed blouses with ballooning trousers underneath, their heads wound in scarves. They carried shopping bags and baskets, cloths bundles, chickens in crates, bread, flowers...\\" Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I was in the roofed bazaar in Istanbul, I saw not a single woman, no ballooning trousers anywhere, just men without crocheted caps, I have a picture to prove it, showing me in an ocean of male Turks or Ottomans. I think when an authoress writes a book she should do what her male counterparts do, research your damn subject, girl!	2005-09-25

It is an art to write a fascinating tale about a still scene on canvas. When in highschool in Germany, we also had to write a whole story found in a single painting. Carl Spitzweg made everyone of his scenes tell a story. Perhaps all painters tell a story in their picture. Tracy Ch. slips into the picture painted by Vermeer around 1660 and becomes the girl, whom she deems to be his maid. By looking at her profile, I disagree that she was a maid who married the butcher, her features are too fine; but it is the freedom of the writer to create a fiction about the girl. With all her housekeeping chores and detailed family life in Delft, Netherlands, the narration takes off well and never becomes boring; and I read every word. It is the literary art of Tracy Chevalier to stay focused on her simple subject and create a spell-binding book based on Vermeers old oil.	2005-08-17

It is hard for men to truly portray a woman; that is why very few genuine female characters exist in literature. Arthur Golden fails too. He fills pages with banalities in the life of a girl training to become a geisha, a social butterfly who must entertain men with dance and tea-parties. Her face is painted white like a mask and her lips are tomatoe-red. A clown face? If Mr. Golden is to be believed, humor is not encouraged in that society. If you make it to page 280 and not have died of boredome yet, you will be appalled with the performance of the highest bidder in Kyoto to deflower her. The act is a bloody mess without any emotional involvement. Do I believe it? No! This elderly creep paid for privilege to eel himself into a virgin. Poor little 15 year old geisha on her way to become a courtesan! I was thinking how many women throw away a moment like that. Do it geisha style, girls! Give it to the highest bidder. One thing was interesting in this book. For the \\"morning after\\" this geisha was handed tea herbs for a concoction to prevent pregnancy. Our pharmaceutical industry has so far prevented us women from learning this ancient secret. As we advance in the Age of Aquarius, we women are on the rise, unstoppable, leaving centuries of degradations behind us; and the movement is blessed, because the world needs female wisdom. If I understand this author correctly, the world of a geisha to be toyed with by men belongs to the past. For it's historical value I must give the book a second star. Ms. Gerborg Frick	2005-08-03

This is his first attempt at writing in 1978 and he fails. It is an anti-Arab pro-Israel concoction with little brain power on both sides. The situation is supposed to resemble Masada, but even a six year old could figure that the besieged group would be out of drinking water after 4 days, and then go get them. But no, there is a lot of senseless slaughter, and then the good guys win. The characters are underdeveloped, the heroine is a slut who preaches morals, and the situation never changes page after page. You can skip this book.

Parenting is the highest art-form; in this suspense novel the reader is led down the path of the sins of the father or mother committed on their child. The story line is fascinating, the characters are in-depth portrayed with their diverse philosophical out-looks. Can the abyss of evil in some soul be bridged and the criminal cravings be healed in freedom or behind bars? How was the evil unleashed? Can the evil be contained behind locked doors? Darkness is needed to become aware of the light. This is a brilliantly written suspense novel, and I recommend it highly for its intelligent content. On many pages you will stop reading, close your eyes and start thinking.	2005-03-19

An intelligent fiction writer staying away from cliches! He spent 3 years researching this subject. He describes tsunamis, in this book one man made by underwater detonations, before the recent devastation hit Indonesia in real life. Using science, he gives proof against the media campaign of global warming. In most issues I do not agree with the present president in the White House, but I agree that global warming is media fiction as seen on TV and not signing the Kyoto Agreement is not his biggest political offense. To rule by spreading fear is an old method. Crichton claims that universities have become fear factories inventing new social terrors and new social anxieties. \\"The majority of nasty little apes calling themselves human beings are starving without clean water and can do nothing but run and hide from the storms of nature, which they cannot control...\\" The book is worth reading for the open minded.	2005-01-05

In this particular story he involves himself with modern day Nazis who have the maturity of six year olds and the criminal mind of Count Dracula combined with racism doomed for failure. That's cliche of modern writers, when they depict the evil and it has become repetetively boring. However, the author uses fascinating English, is quite resourceful with words.

The biography is hard to follow because events and persons are mixed in a weird cocktail. The author does not follow a clear story line, has perhaps just as little writing talent as she claims Beryl Markham did. Beryl's uninhibited life in Africa and Los Angeles is documented, but not much credit given to her remarkable talents this woman obviously possessed. Her third husband Raoul Schumacher, a Hollywood ghostwriter, is believably credited with the authorship of &quot;West with the Night&quot;. He couldn't have written so well without the vivid recollections about horsebreeding, aviation and animal behavior in Africa by his wife Beryl Markham, whom he adored.<br />This biography is a hodgepodge through which one most roam to come about facts.

She describes first hand encounters with lions and elephants, very interesting observations on animal behavior. She also describes the natives, and I wished she would have even gotten more into them.

Writings in Cyrillic and Inuktitut must urgently be deciphered, but the madness cannot be stopped.  Many explosions later the ones who deserve to live, miraculously prevail.  James Rollings has a sophisticated writing style and much knowledge about the animal kingdom due to being a veterinarian. The worst animals in his stories, however, seem to be the species human with a relentless \\"kill!\\"-gene, mostly each other.

In this connection light is shed on the motive behind the abduction of Elisabeth Smart by the Saint Immanuel.<br />After 17 years being condemned to death row, Ron Lafferty, who murdered his sister in law and her infant, is retried fearing that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial in the first place, and to determine whether he was and is crazy or sane according to accepted legal criteria.

I asked myself: \\"How old is this author?\\" Born in 1974, he is now 30, presenting an infantile style and plot: characters have no depth, are not convincing, females are stick figures, Nazis are the villains ad nauseam (every 6 year old knows that...), unbelievable amounts of bullets flare out of rectangular muzzles, ripping  everything to shreds including this story, and if you are into details of weaponry, maybe you will enjoy this arsenal. And if you are into astronomy you might understand what the Incan god- statue was made of to be of such lure to modern world destroyers. After 295 pages - far from the end at page 523 - , I lost interest. But then I am female and not into high tech weapons with which to kill mindlessly.

Period!  Oprah's book club is a booster for the book printing industry now drowning in an avalanche of incompetent female writers, a disaster for the American culture.  She promotes female writers who, due to the lack of brilliance, cannot write themselves safely out of a telephone booth.  Though warned, I purchased the above book because the subject of this book has stirred my interest greatly, noticing an ocean of burning candles always at the altar of the black Madonna in the Theatiner cathedral of Munich.  I learned that she is a replica of the famous Loreto Madonna of Italy. There are many more black madonnas throughout Europe than encountered in China Galland's path.  In kaffeeklatsch style she narrates her trips to other continents in pursuit of the black Madonna and fails her attempt to fit the peaces of her puzzle together to a coherent picture.  In her travels she visits Auschwitz-Birkenau and makes politically correct statements which are historically incorrect: \\"Hitler was popularly elected\\".  Hitler was appointed chancellor by President Hindenburg in 1933.  What does this have to do with Longing for Darkness?  The author is safest when she quotes (copies) men who have done research on her subject, the origin of the black Madonna throughout history.  And only when quoting others does her book gain some merit.  I give her a star for being industrious; however, skip this book!

The style of this author is o.k.; somewhat repeat with not enough dialogues so the descriptions become tedious, but the action is compelling.  This is the first book I read by Eugene Izzi. For people emmigrating to the US., this book could surely be an eye-opener about the \\"promised land\\": The crime scenes of the inner cities. The author gives the impression that he knows first-hand what he is writing about. This book is about the hopelessness of the youth being forced to become gang-bangers, clutched in a vicious circle of immorality, when the formative teenage years are wasted in hopelessness. In the United States, a good youth program is to lock them up. Nasty as the Nazis were, they had an idealistic youth program (Hitler-Jugend), because it was believed that the youth is the future of a nation.  In this book the outlook is dim, as the only way out for the inner-city youth is a cage or the cemetery. The statistics don't lie: 10 000 people die each year by fire-arms in the United States, while in other countries the number is around 160.

I disagree with the 5 million women who were tortured and murdered within 300 years by the Roman-Catholics; the actual number is 9 million. Interesting how state and church were combined; it seems to me there lies more power in the church than any state has every held as the Vatican survived two thousand years.

Trial attorney Gerry Spence writes a fascinating tale about one of his trials in which he defends the American underdog.  Spence describes a chivalrous undertaking on his part, feeling that a more intellectually advanced human being should become involved with the problems of the less advanced, the unfortunate and the meek.  In his book Half Moon and Empty Stars, Spence writes a defense story about the fateful American Indians in modern times, and in Of Murder and Madness his subjects are Mexican Americans in Wyoming and their dire circumstances.  As the defense lawyer in a murder case, he takes us behind the scenes unveiling the caprice of the \\"courthouse club\\" and the criminal shortcomings of the Welfare Department.  He says an insane society produces \\"skitz\\" (schizophrenia sufferers).  The story of psychotic Joe is interwoven with Spence's autobiography and philosophical outlooks.  The battle in this trial is for the lost soul of the defendant, a noble cause for one determined trial attorney.  Gerborg	2003-01-06

The reader is taken into a Jewish family, where the main character, Stern,  does not know anybody except his colorful, scheming, affluent brother in law.  His son, daughters, son in law and especially his wife of decades are strangers to him.  So are his close neighbors.  Yet Stern is a successful lawyer, must have a reasonable amount of intelligence, one should hope.  An unlikely situation, but entertaining enough.  It seems like he really doesn't want to know what makes his family tick but stumbles into their secrets.  Rude awakenings!  That would be a better title, because the legal aspects of the book read like murky morass.  I think the author failed his burden of proof to convince me, that this is a good novel.  His style is tiresome to read, however the proof is there, that fiction has no limits, because it demands no burden of proof. Rude awakenings for fans of this author, I assume!  Gerborg	2002-12-21

The backdrop are developments in the Persian Golf.  Vince Flynn is a stickler to technical details, which are often lengthy page fillers. The plot however is dramatized by the fact that panic rooms or bunkers seem to have one thing in common: chronic communication failure.  The hero in this nightmare is Mitch Rapp, a fearless dragon slayer, whom I met in Separation of Power by Vince Flynn.  I will read this author again in The Third Option.  Gerborg	2002-12-06

One of the first symptoms is dyspeptic pain.  Dr Batman has treated over 3 000 patients with dyspeptic pain, who responded to an increase in water intake, and their clinical problems associated with pain disappeared.  When the body urgently calls for water, nothing else can substitute it, neither antacids nor cimetidine medications.<br /> It has been shown experimentally that one glass of water is immediately absorbed by the intestine and within one half hour secreted into the stomach for food breakdown.  That's why Dr.Batman advises to drink two glasses of water before each meal.  He reasons that this simple rule will help to dissolve excess cholesterol buildup, normalize hypertension, avert migraine headaches, and even prevent Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Batman claims that antacids contain 150-600 mg of aluminum in every spoonful of the liquid, or in each tablet that is chewed.  Aluminum toxicity is a secondary complication of dehydration, in which many, many functions of brain cells begin to get lost.<br />The book is very explicit and elaborates on many diseases that plague modern society; I especially took benefit on his chapter on Aids.  I do highly recommend this book, in my capacity as MA, Reiki Master and Bachelor of Science in Natural Health.  Gerborg	2002-12-01

In the meanwhile the Red Man has succumbed to the hardships of a systematic genocide inflicted upon him by the White Man, and that is where Gerry Spence picks up with his novel.  He produces a suspenseful narration of the pitiful state of existence of what remains of the Ameroindians in our US society... still hunted, still savagely abused.  The story flows from his feather in abundance of his court room drama experiences. Attorney Abner Hill, the hero of the story, is often plagued by his shortcomings when facing corrupt opponents, and perhaps that makes him so human and likeable. It is an enriching book...	2002-11-13

He is a good read.  In this book however you wait for the Prime Witness to arrive forever.  While you are waiting for him/her to be uncovered, there are endless repetitions, delays, repetitions, delays, repetitions.... You get the picture?  A bureaucratic monster of a white court horse.  If you are a lawyer you might enjoy it and learn a few tricks.  Me? ... well I muddled along until the Prime Witness is encountered on page 376, and doesn't want to talk, of course, pointing will do, and 375 pages of boredome come to an abrupt end.  The End.

Mutant Message Down Under is one of the greatest books you will ever have the privilege to read.

Her story line is scatterbrained, her characters are boring, leading a misguided daily existence on 420 pages written in an incomprehensible style. On page 421 the author begins to explain what happened the previous pages, because I swear most readers don't have a clue so far. The mother seems to have murdered her daughter with a kitchen knife caesareanstyle, the six year old wants to babtize the babytwins drowning them in a brook or water nearby. And good dear daddy is boring until you find out his nasty dark secret. The quagmire is so deep, that even Fatima, or any religious aspiration cannot penetrate all this negativity, hopelessness, immorality, and dysfunction.
