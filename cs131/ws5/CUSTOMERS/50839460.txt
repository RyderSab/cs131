Unfortunately, they did not get these ideas from reading the Koran.  Osama bin Laden and his followers can point to passages in the Koran that \\"justify\\" their actions, and there is no way that you can prove they are wrong solely by reference to the Koran.  As long as there is a sizable group of people who insist on interpreting the Koran literally, there will always be conflict.<br /><br />Spencer's work is also valuable for pointing out that Westerners can stop beating themselves up for the Crusades.  True, some of the \\"Christians\\" performed outrageous acts, but the Middle East and Northern Africa were Christian until Mohammed and his armies offered them the choices of (a) conversion, (b) submission, or (c) death.	2005-09-13

Dealing primarily with the life and times of King George VI, it gives an account of his birth, early childhood, accession to the Throne, and the extreme goodwill earned by the royal family during the Second World War.  Intended to be a favorable and sympathetic rendering, the book still manages to demonstrate (probably unintentionally) that some of the British Royalty are pompous, arrogant, cold, and not too bright.  Queen Mary, for example.	2005-08-15

Ferguson case, decided by the United States Supreme Court, and establishing the doctrine of \\"separate but equal\\" that would remain the law of land until overturned in 1954.<br /><br />Minor criticism:  the cover illustration shows a low-class white attempting to evict a well-dressed black man from his seat on a train.  The picture has nothing to do with Plessy v. Ferguson.  First of all, Homer Plessy was only 1/8 black, and it was not noticeable to the uninformed observer.  Secondly, as material inside the book indicates, the picture depicts an incident that occurred in Pennsylvania in 1856 (40 years before the Plessy decision).  Finally, strange as it may seem today, racial segregation was supported by all strata of Southern society (and a good many folks in the North too).  It was just the way things were done, and no one really thought much about it.<br /><br />Except for the cover illustration, a great book, and all serious students of constitutional history should read it.	2005-08-01

Established in 1883 as DeLand Academy, it was, in the late 1880's, endowed by John B. Stetson, the hat manufacturer, and renamed Stetson University in his honor.  From its beginning, and until the middle 1990's, Stetson University was affiliated with the Florida Baptist Convention.<br /><br />Gilbert Lycan was Chairman of Stetson's history department from 1946 to 1975.  This book was published in 1983, on the occasion of Stetson's centennial observance.  In the book, Lycan promises to tell the good as well as the bad, and in so doing, has provided a valuable historical record, especially for alumni and other friends of Stetson University.<br /><br />I give the book only 3 stars, though, for several reasons:  the first is Lycan's weak citation style.  Although much of the narrative depends on an understanding of the provisions in Stetson's charter, Lycan fails to include a copy of that document as an appendix.  Also, Lycan refers to a decision of the Florida Supreme Court but fails to give the customary legal citation, making it more difficult for anyone who might wish to consult the original source material.  In recounting the various controversies that arose between the University and the Florida Baptist Convention over the years, Lycan tends to act as apologist for the Convention.  Lycan also tends to overemphasize the College of Liberal Arts to the exclusion of the School of Business Administration, the School of Music, and the College of Law.<br /><br />In the controversy leading to Paul Geren's resignation as President, Lycan was very active in seeking Geren's removal from office; thus, he may not be the most objective source of information on that period in Stetson's history.<br /><br />Finally, the book reflects Lycan's naivete on certain points.  There is an old story that, in 1901, Henry Flagler made a significant donation to the University in exchange for the University's help in changing Florida's divorce law so that Flagler could divorce his insane wife and remarry.  Lycan states that he found no evidence of such an agreement.  Well, now.  If there was such an agreement, it would not be committed to paper.Flagler could divorce his insane wife and remarry.

The Constitution means whatever five Justices of the Supreme Court say it means, nothing more and nothing less, and their views are subject to change without notice.  Why?  Because the Court has asserted that power, and we accept it meekly.<br /><br />The author analyzes various issues, and shows how the Supreme Court has changed its view over time.  All the while, the text of the Constitution remained exactly the same.  Only the philosophy and views and personnel of the Court changed.<br /><br />In fairness to the Court, it should be pointed out that the Framers of the Constitution and its subsequent amendments used extremely vague and amorphous language that can mean anything to anyone.  Such language, combined with an activist court, is like handing the federal judges a blank check and telling them to go on a shopping spree.<br /><br />Lawyers have known of the author's thesis for a long time.  It is hoped that, through reading this book and others like it, the general public will know, and demand that appropriate action be taken to require a more faithful and reasoned analysis of the Constitution.  Tyranny by judges is no better than tyranny by anyone else.	2005-03-21

For example, the author makes a big deal over the flagpole at Buckingham Palace and the Queen's alleged initial refusal to fly the flag at half mast.  That flagpole is for the Royal Standard.  When the Queen is home, the Royal Standard (not the Union Jack) flies full.  When the Queen is not home, the flagpole has nothing on it.  Merely following that tradition is not a sign of disrespect, except in the minds of people who are not knowledgeable.<br /><br />The book describes Diana and Mother Theresa as \\"two humanitarians.\\"  Give me a break.  Mother Theresa did far more for the poor in a day than Diana did in her whole life.  Shaking hands with an AIDS patient (as a lawyer meeting clients, I have done that lots of time) or spouting the liberal view on land mines does not qualify a person as \\"humanitarian.\\"  It is a genuine shame that Mother Theresa, after a lifetime of dedicated service to the poor, had the misfortune to die in the same week as Diana, and, as a result, be virtually ignored.	2005-02-25

Before reading this book, I had a rather low opinion of President John Adams.  In school, we learned that Adams, as Washington's Vice President, was preoccupied with establishing a high-sounding title for the President.  As President, he signed the infamous Alien and Sedition laws, served only one term, and was defeated for re-election.  In general, he is portrayed as a vain, pompous, monarchy-sympathizing person.<br />David McCullough disabuses the reader of those notions very quickly.  Adams' integrity, honesty, and passion for American independence and democracy comes through loud and clear.  McCullough does not avoid the hard issues:  he deals with Adams' role in attempting to craft a title for President Washington and frankly admits that the Alien and Sedition laws were a mistake.  By reading this biography, however, one understands what may have motivated the Congress to enact the legislation and the President to sign it.<br />The roles of Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and others are briefly explored, and one's view of them may change a bit after reading the book.<br />I heartily recommend the book to any serious student of U.S. history.  Others will find it enjoyable as well.	2003-10-01

When her lips are not moving.  In her first book, written in 1949, she tells of the time she met the Captain and the children for the first time.  She describes a scene that is very similar to the scene in the play and in the movie.  She even mentions that the Captain used a whistle to call the children.<br />In this book, she states that the Captain was not at home when she arrived, and that Baroness Matilda introduced the children to her.<br />Hoping that no one will notice her contradictory lies, she blames the producers of the play for (falsely) portraying her husband as a stern disciplinarian.  Well, give me a break.  It was her 1949 book, telling of the whistle, that gave them the idea.  There is also a chapter in the 1949 book about &quot;the baron doesn't want it.&quot;<br />So, she invents the story, and then blames us for believing it.	2003-07-29

It would be interesting if we could read the honest appraisal of the children.  For example, in the 1949 book, Maria tells about meeting the captain and the children for the first time.  She describes a scene that is very similar to what we saw in the movie.  She even tells how the captain used a whistle to call the children.<br />In 1972, however, she wrote a book called &quot;Maria,&quot; in which she states that the captain was not at home when she arrived, and that &quot;Baroness Matilda&quot; introduced her to the children.<br />OK, which was it?<br />I suspect there are deep divisions in this family (as there usually are in second-marriage situations), and so far, the children have been too polite (or too psychologically mixed up) to tell us the real truth.  Evidence of the division is found in the fact that the movie does not use the children's names, and mixes up the order of their births (e.g. in real life, the oldest child was a boy, not a girl).  Did the children refuse to grant the right to use their names?	2003-07-26

One day, a strong wind transports him to another land, where he encounters lizards that can turn different colors (blue, orange, pink, and other wild hues).  George is bewildered at first, and suffers nightmares in which the multi-hued lizards pursue him.  By the end of the book, George has learned how to express himself by turning multiple hues, and everyone lives happily ever after.<br />This book is not about diversity, but rather, it is about George's need to conform to the lizards around him.  Why can't the multiple-hued lizards learn to celebrate George's diversity and accept him for what he is?  Why does George have to conform to them?  A lizard's ability to turn brown or green is a survival technique.  The idea is to be inconspicuous.  A lizard that could turn orange, or blue, or pink, or some other wild color, would not survive five minutes in nature, as it would be attacked by predators.<br />Liberal, politically-correct left wingers gravitate to the freaks.  In this book, impressionable young children are exposed to a freak (multiple-hued lizards that do not exist and could not survive), and they are taught that it is the normal lizard that must conform to the freaks.	2002-12-22

Even after the Civil War, there were Northern States that did not permit negroes to vote.  Lincoln's enduring, all-important act, for which we are eternally in his debt, is that he saved the union.  If he had not accomplished that, nothing else would have mattered.<br />Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation is a cleverly-crafted device that furthered the goal of preserving the Union.  Slavery was unaffected in those parts of the &quot;Confederate States of America&quot; that had been reconquered.  It was also unaffected in Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri, the slave states that remained loyal to the Union.  The preliminary proclamation, issued in September, 1862, put the South on notice that they could rejoin the Union and keep their slaves if they did so prior to January 1, 1863.  They did not do so, so the proclamation was issued.<br />Although the Proclamation &quot;freed the slaves&quot; only where it could not be enforced, the slaves would be free as soon as the territory could be conquered (e.g. Sherman's March to the Sea in Georgia).  Lincoln therefore made it clearly appear that the North was fighting to liberate the slaves (as well as preserve the union) and that the South was fighting to keep the slaves.<br />If the North had not won the war, the Proclamation would have counted for nothing.  Any treaty between the United States and the Confederate States doubtless would have recognized the rights of Southerners to their &quot;property&quot; and would have included strict fugitive slave provisions if any crossed over into the United States.<br />The immediate benefit of Lincoln's strategy is that England and France dropped all plans to recognize the Confederacy.  They did not wish to be aligned with a government fighting to preserve slavery.<br />Abraham Lincoln is, without exception, the greatest President ever to serve.  He saved the Union, and incidental to that effort, he set in motion the process by which the slaves were freed.  If black people think he is racist, perhaps they would have preferred Jefferson Davis or Robert E. Lee as president?tion the process by which the slaves were freed.

Most of the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; are fantastic conjecture, and Posner does a good job of demonstrating this.  Despite coming to the same conclusion, Posner is not merely an apologist for the Warren Commission.  He is quick to point out the shortcomings of its analysis.<br />In fairness to both points of view, however, I will say that we will probably never know the complete truth about what happened in Dealy Plaza on November 22, 1963.  Much of the blame for that can be laid at the feet of the Kennedy family, who did everything they could to suppress the evidence.  For example, it was they who objected to making the autopsy report generally available.  It is terribly difficult to reconstruct an event from a distance of almost 40 years.<br />The only significant weaknesses of Posner's book:<br />1.  His citation style is faulty.  For example, he claims that the Louisiana Legislature unanimously censured Jim Garrison.  In support of that, he cites to a 1992 interview.  He should have cited the resolution so that anyone desiring to read it and evaluate his conclusion would have the opportunity to do so.<br />2.  He uses what I call &quot;sintilla analysis&quot; in reaching his conclusion.  If there are two points of view on an issue, he will pick the one that supports his conclusion if there is a sintilla of evidence to support it and reject all other points of view.<br />In summary, though, Posner has made a valuable contribution to the literature, and for me, the CASE IS CLOSED.	2001-06-25

It is hard to follow and it is difficult to imagine some of the things that the author writes about.  For example, putting bran in the scarecrow's head and saying that he has  &quot;bran-new brains.&quot;  I am glad that the screenwriters for the  movie were able to preserve the basic story line and produce a much better  product.	2000-01-30

I cannot read, write, or speak German, so I am at a serious disadvantage when trying to evaluate Hitler's writing or speaking ability.  Assuming, however, that the English translation is accurate, I cannot see how this  maniacal idiot could have captivated otherwise intelligent and industrious  people.  I guess the Great Depression did strange things to people.  I knew  someone who escaped from Germany in the 1930's, and I asked him once,  &quot;What did Hitler say in those speeches that had everyone  transfixed?&quot;  His response:  &quot;Nothing at all, if you thought  about 15 minutes later.&quot;	1999-12-06

I suppose the only benefit was that the Mitchell Trusts got to extend their copyright on GWTW, which would have expired in 2011 if they had not consented to the writing of the sequel.   Scarlett lacks the interplay of history and devotion to the traditions of  the Old South that is evident thoroughout Margaret Mitchell's  work.<br />Ripley obviously spent a lot of time engaged in historical  research.  For example, she knew that South Carolina law did not permit  divorce (a circumstance that was not changed until after World War II) and  also knew that military courts sometimes granted divorces anyway during the  Reconstruction Period.	1999-11-29

Board of Education.  The book is marred by several glaring  factual errors, however.	1999-11-19
