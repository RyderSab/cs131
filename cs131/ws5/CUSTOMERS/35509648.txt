This book on relationships in today's dating world is totally \\"off the wall\\" but great fun to read, although often gramatically and politically incorrect and full of foul-mouthed expletives. It is definitely not for the  judgemental reader. However, the authors, both men who still refuse to reveal their identy (for reasons obvious when you read the book) hit the nail on the head with what are the problems in today's failing marriage and love relationships and other relationships as well. With total candor and often hilarious situations and comments, they offer solutions for the real world which might work in solving relationship problems: first and foremost, to become a whole person by yourself before you enter a relationship. Relationships do not fix your shortcomings.  The combined wisdom and difficult situations adn experiences of the two authors, one who lives in Canada and the other in Europe, are shared and bared in ways not many have the boldness to write. Often in letter or stream-of-consciousness style, the book rambles some, but overall it is a fun read, and has some sage advice administered in a novel and quirky way!	2005-10-02

Little known to the average citizen of or visitor to Paris, the city was built over the quarries from which stone for the buildings was cut. As the city grew, so did the caverns beneath it until on one fateful day during the reign of King Louis XVI  on Dec. 17, 1774, an entire street (near today's Place Denfert-Rochereau )collapsed into the abyss.  The King's council to investigate was formed and the finding were so alarming that within three years architects and inspectors set about building reinforcements in the form of inspection galleries, which ultimately (by the mid 1930's) resulted in 177 miles of underground tunnels within these quarries to make the city safe. Although entering these underground passages is forbidden except with express permission, for three centuries artists, musicians, writers, performers, and curious, daring cataphyles have found the lure into the depths irresistable and have made their way through clandestined passages. Through the centuries, because everyone needed to mark his or her way in order not to be lost, and because the bare walls beckoned to be decorated, the passages and quarries became an underground, daring art gallery.  This book incorporates a remarkable attempt to catalogue the surreptitious art found beneath one of Europe's most thriving cities of the arts.  The historic events, since the earliest graffiti in 1671, have been charted or commemorated, pictured, or commented upon, with drawings, writings, paintings, sculpture, and music created within the labyrinth. While most is primitive art \\"just for the fun of it,\\" some is quite skilled and reveals great talent. For three centuries the underground has been the location for secret love affairs, hiding criminals, storing beer and champagne, and many other illegal activities, while also providing the stone canvas and dark inspiration for hundreds of artists and performers of all kinds. You'll want to read and study the photographs in this fascinating book.piration for hundreds of artists and performers of all kinds.

Nelon:  For the curious armchair traveler who likes to encounter strange cultures that are far removed from the norm of our standard Western Culture, James R. Nelon's \\"Pursuing A Dream\\" is a good read. Nelon, who took off a year from the corporate rat race of the business and computer world, gives us a book of detailed descriptions and intimate photography of village life in remote areas of Indonesia. Nelon does a wonderful job of letting the reader see through his descriptions and photos just how different life can be on this planet. From his presence at a festival and burial ceremony in the village of Rantepao, Tana Toraja, to observing the life around Lake Tempe in Sulawesi, to a trip to the mystic Seram Island, to life in a longhouse in West Kalimantan, Nelon emerses the reader in the lives of Indonesians that are far removed from the lifestyles of  today's tourists. His photos of the people are particularly striking and give a face to the culture being described. As a reader, I found myself wishing each picture had been placed in the book beside the descriptive paragraphs; however, today's publishing costs may have forced the photos to their placement in two groups of numbered pictures. Nelon's description is excellent but the reader will find some lack of transition between events or places, as the book is more journalizing than well connected narration. Readers will also want a map of Indonesia and Asia while reading if they are not familiar with that part of the world. Also, I was confused by the insertion of the narrations of the death of his dog Barclay, his approach and relationship to his religious background, and his grandmother. All of these were well written pieces but I couldn't follow their connection to the Indonesian experience. But all in all the book is a valuable look into a faraway culture that seems not of our times	2005-08-31

D., is another of the prolific author's metaphysical adventures in healing.  She is from a family of healers with much experience of faith healing. On a recent trip to Santorini Island in Greece she experienced contact with a group of angels called the \\"Angels of Atlantis\\" and was transmitted many of their healing formulas and ancient Atlantean knowledge about the healing properties of love and light.  The book details her metaphysical and physical experiences in Santorini, the volcanic island which many believe is the location of the ancient Atlantis. Although, most readers will find her fantastic mystical experiences to be beyond belief (and to many a bit wacky), the author has many case histories of healings according to the angelic directions. Doreen also gives the reader detailed instructions of how to entreat angelic intervention in many kinds of healing: from finances and automobiles to physical and emotional ills of people and pets. At the end of the book you'll find a very interesting guide to the use of color and crystals for healing. A little too fantastic or simplistic for most people in our Western society, the methods detailed here could be the common medical practices of past or future civilizations	2005-08-31

The author is skilled in the Magick, which he describes as \\"partnering with the universe to create change\\" and details ways it is used, called by other terms, in all the great world religions.  Penczak is also a deeply spiritual person whose skills as a Master of Reiki are well-known.  In this book he shows the novice who is serious about learning the art and faith of laying on of hands for healing purposes, how to learn the skills and disciplines required. Christopher is both a practitioner and teacher of reiki and draws from his many years of experiences of healing in both this field and magick.  His methods go back to the beginning of reiki healing as taught in Japan, and he details not only the disciplines but also the secret symbols that must be learned. With many examples of healing and demonstrating great faith and humility, he teaches in the simplest terms so that anyone dedicated to the practice can learn how to become the empty vessel through which God works for healing beyond anything understood by science.

A YEAR OF SUNDAYS by Edward G. Webster is a must read for not only those who are planning to strike out on an extended stay in a foreign country but also for those who have imagined striking out on their own but never really thought it could be a possibility. Ed relates his year long journey through Europe with his wife Marguerite and cat Felicia from Paris to the Netherlands, Brittany, Austria, Italy, Greece, and Spain in a most informative and entertaining way. The reader quickly finds the Webster's adventure to have several uncommon aspects: traveling with a pet in Europe, staying within a budget of $100 per day on lodging, food and entertainment for the whole year abroad, and, most important, the fact that Marguerite is blind. Marguerite's blindness adds a dimension to the book that you will not find in any other book on travel. The interaction between Marguerite, Ed, and Felicia to communicate what they experience in each their own way makes the reader aware of new ways to grasp the essence of travel through senses and feelings not often used by the average traveler. This all seems to heighten and expand aspects of the places visited and create a new awareness of other ways to experience life in another country or culture. Just as Ed describes how he closes his eyes during a concert at Notre Dame Cathedral so that he does not just see and hear the concert in a beautiful cathedral but feels as Marguerite feels the sound fill the cathedral and echo off the stone pillars, bringing the building to life and filling the evening \\"with so much more than just sound.\\" The senses of sound, smell, touch, taste become additives to the travel adventure, and the traveler who relies mainly on what they are seeing is more handicapped in grasping the essence of the place than Marguerite without her sight. The book also gives the reader descriptions of out of the way places that have unique character in their surroundings, food, and citizens. The reader can not help wanting to taste the delicious pannenkoekens (pancakes) of Holland after Ed's narration or walk along the cliffs of Brittany experiencing the smells and sounds of the ocean clashing with the land or taste the wine, bread, cheese, olives, and lasagna served up by the owner of a little grocery in Costafabbri, Italy. But the book also gives a realistic look at the downside of traveling for a long time on one's own in a foreign country. The book relates those periods where loneliness sets in because of not speaking the language and longing for contact with family and friends as well as not knowing what lies ahead when they move to another country. The reader can not help but realize the importance of having people and animals by your side that you love at times like this. I found I could not help but be pulled along vicariously with the Webster's year of Sundays throughout Europe. The couple's love for each other, Felicia their cat, world culture, and life comes through loud and clear. Though Ed is the writer, the essence of this book is enhanced by the Marguerite's insights and feelings. Telling themselves that they were right to seize the day and take off on the year long trip, Ed and Marguerite toast Ed's dad saying, \\"If he hadn't died young, I might not have been smart enough to take the year off in the first place\\", and then ending with \\"And to celebrating life!\\", which is what their book is all about.ste the delicious pannenkoekens (pancakes) of Holland after Ed's narration or walk along the cliffs of Brittany experiencing the smells and sounds of the ocean clashing with the land or taste the wine, bread, cheese, olives, and lasagna served up by the owner of a little grocery in Costafabbri, Italy.

As a youngster he was blamed for everything his step brothers did wrong and was punished instead of these half-siblings.  With warnings never to tell his father, his step-mother beat him with a rubber hose until he had whelps and bruises constantly on his emaciated and sickly body, while screaming at him \\"You're not worth the room you take up on this earth!\\" Overcoming this horrible childhood, which included sexual abuse from his step-mother, the author was able, with the help of some kind friends, to get out of the situation and find a meager job to support himself as a young teen, although he still had to send money home to help support his father's family.  He worked his way through college, a loveless marriage of seventeen years, rearing two children, and finally realized and acknowledged that a large part of his misery as an adult  was that he was a closet gay, a fact which he had concealed from even himself. The book chronicles the milestones of his terrible early life, the way he found his freedom and self-worth, and the successful career he had as a fund-raiser, counselor and minister to young people on college campuses, with hundreds he saved from drug abuse and suicide.  Nearing the end of his life, he has written this book in his seventies because when he was young and his aunt learned about what he had suffered, she told him that someday he should write a book to help others and heal hinself.

Dr. Chopra is world renowned as perhaps the foremost leader in mind/body medicine and the creator of The Chopra Center for Well Being in California and is the author of over 35 books. In THE BOOK OF SECRETS the author reveals fifteen secrets of personal transformation to help the reader turn fear, aggression, doubt, insecurity, hatred, and emptiness into their opposites. By learning these secrets of profound wisdom, you will see how your own transformation can and will change the world we live in.  We all live in fear at the edge of terror in today's world, but Dr. Chopra emphasizes this is because we do not perceive who we really are and the power of God, the power for good, within each of us. \\"Who am I?\\" is the crucial question. In Dr. Chopra's words the answer is \\"the key to ending all violence, suffering, and lack in the world.\\"  The key is to experience on a deep level that \\"you are not in the world, the world is in you.\\"  While revealing the importance and the power we each have as creators of our own and the world's outcomes, the author warns about the pitfalls of \\"spiritual materialism,\\"  transferring values that work in the material world to apply to the world of spirit.  When we really get in touch with the invisible domain from which all power and wisdom comes, the realm within each of us, we discover the Intelligence guiding the Universe to which we can connect.  These fifteen secrets teach us how.  One of the most inspiring and personally valuable books you could ever read.	2005-03-30

Leder takes his inspirations from nature, as do many mystics, but he also finds just as deep inspirations from daily chores or mechanical objects within his environment.  Although a flower, rain, or a beautiful sunset are deep and meaningful experiences that place us in a state of wonder, most of us are so accustomed to seeing these daily gifts as commonplace events, and we don't notice them any more.  Leder teaches us to open to every experience and every sight as if we are babies, or an alien from another planet seeing these things or events for the very first time. To practice this is something familiar to Zen Buddhists but not so easy for the average person in a busy work-a-day world.  However, no one could be busier than the author, who is a full professor of Western and Eastern Philosophy at Loyola University and also has an M.D. from Yale University School of Medicine. He leads workshops, works extensively with prisoners, and has authored many books, and is in demand as a public speaker and for think-tanks. In this wonderful book he'll teach you how to turn dish-washing, football, pens and pencils, merry-go-rounds, smells, whispers, and sex into mystical whisperings of your soul to which you'll learn to pay attention and be present, enhancing all of your daily routines and finding peace and joy throughout your life.

Even when Nino feels he has distanced himself from the corrupt world of dishonesty and crime, he finds himself entangled through the actions and dealings of his brother.  The plot takes many turns and twists that are unexpected and ends in an unusual way.  The authors seem, in the end, to wish to show that there can be forgiveness and restitution, within the boundaries of family relationships, that supercede the wrongs committed, but I found that the reader may not be able to agree that the characters merit this forgiveness.<br /><br />\\"Blood Bond\\" holds the readers' attention through plot twists and is an easy read but does lack some fleshing out of certain characters as well as lacking more vivid descriptions of certain key places.

As both a parent and grandparent, I am amazed at Donaldson's wisdom and insight.  I am gratified that he asks not only the obvious questions, like \\"How often does an infant need to be bathed?\\", but the more deeply penetrating questions like \\"What makes you think you are worthy (or unworthy) to have a child?\\" \\"If your child turned out to be exactly like you would that make you happy or unhappy?\\"  and \\"Think of your most valuable possession. How would you react if that were damaged or destroyed by your child?\\"  Granted, you cannot possibly know before having children how incredibly much you will love them, and you cannot possibly answer all the questions in this book without experience of parenting, but these are very pertinent questions to ASK yourself and your spouse.

American Society of Journalists and Authors is a highly esteemed association of published writers, many of whom derive their total income from their \\"pens.\\"  Instead of carefully guarding the practices and methods that have made them successful, twenty-eight of these writers have written a chapter of the book, each with a different focus for writing success: from office tools to methods of writing, gathering ideas, selling to each type of media, researching, finding help, law, taxes, and so much more. The Appendix is also a wealth of important nuggets of wisdom and tips from many more ASJA members. As a long-time member myself and a journalist with over 30 years' experience, I thought I might not need the book, but I have found prized helps and new ideas on every page of this wonderful book.  It is now my office reference, like friends and teachers gathered around me all wishing me success in my writing endeavors.

In the introduction Jeff tells young readers,\\"I don't need to go (that) far to see amazing wildlife up close...you can still experience the awesome beauty of nature almost anwhere you go, any day of the week.  The books in the new series for elementary age readers are 46 pages and loaded with full color photographs and Jeff's enthusiastic words telling about whatever place he is examining in each volume.

The series includes Snaketacular, which is about Jeff's passion and favorite species.  There will be a book on each state, introducing kids to the natural wonders of plants and animals within or unique to that state. We selected Alaska, Arizona, Louisiana, California, and Florida and found each to be equally exciting and informative.

The book encompasses a large number of hotels in the United States as well as numerous lodgings in Europe, Canada, Mexico, and even Turkey and Thailand. Each of the hotels shown met Ms. Lanier's criteria of having fewer than 200 rooms (I found that most were from 20 to 60 rooms), a high staff-to-guest ratio, the feeling being in a fine residence, little touches not usually experienced in a normal hotel, and overall attention to details. The author also took into consideration the hotel's appeal in the area of meeting the various needs of today's experienced traveler, such as: services for business travelers needing Internet access, secretarial service on call, and teleconferencing; physical fitness facilities as well as privileges for the guests to other sports clubs in the area; and last but surely not least, fine cuisine and the particular dining atmosphere.<br /><br />On each of the 238 pages of the book is the overall information of a particular hotel. These listings are categorized by country and state, beginning with a hotel in Alaska and ending with one in Istanbul, Turkey. With each listing, the reader will find about a 250 to 300 word description of the hotel and surrounding area, a picture, and an index that tells the reader such things as: address and phone numbers, room and suite rates, number of rooms and suites, attractions in area, restrictions, services and amenities, business facilities, sports facilities, and in hotel dining. I found that the room rates ran from as low as $65 to $600. The photos give the traveler a good idea of the type of hotel being listed and the descriptive summaries give good detail as to the essential ambiance the author encountered.<br /><br />Pamela Lanier has also written Golf Resorts: A Complete Guide, which focuses on over 1,000 nationwide, giving good evidence to her having a great deal of experience in this area of the travel field., which focuses on over 1,000 nationwide, giving good evidence to her having a great deal of experience in this area of the travel field.	2005-01-08

The little book even comes with a Portuguese For Travelers CD which is well done and most helpful.  An unusual feature is pictures of the local foods you should try and of specific items to buy as souvenirs, as well as important hand signs to know so that you won't embarrass yourself by using what is an innocent gesture in your home country and may be obscene in Rio. As all guidebooks do, this includes suggested restaurants, bars, hotels, etc. but it also includes places YOU DO NOT want to go with warnings of what you might encounter.  There are suggested activities for rain or shine and according to specific interests. If you are young, liberal, and adventurous, and open-minded this is an excellent travel guide.  However, if you are easily offended or judgemental this is not for you, as some of the slang language and some of the acitivities outlined will not meet your approval.	2005-01-08

Dangerous De-Liaisons, What's Really Behind the War Between France and the US by Jean-Marie Colombani and Walter Wells is very pertinent to read during this pre-election period in the United States. This book was written by two of the world's leading newspaper editors. Colombani is editor of Le Monde, the major French newspaper, and Wells is an American who is editor in chief of The International Herald Tribune. The book has the format of a friendly but very well informed conversation between the two editors. The reader learns much of the history of the two nations and the conflict over the US war in Iraq.  These men focus on the reasons behind the deteriorated relationship between France and the US, the new world in which terrorism has become a chief concern worldwide, and the rapidly developing economic impact of the growing European Union.  If you are remotely interested in the way the world views the US and the international concept of the US since the end of the Cold War, this book is vital to read. You will gain insights into why relationships have deteriorated and what is behind the scenes that the general public does not know. It is a fascinating read to learn and explore \\"the chilling question: Can our two nations once again unite to make the world a better place - or has our war only just begun?\\"	2005-01-08

Shortcut to Spirituality, Mastering the Art of Inner Peace by Bob Gottfried, Ph.D. is much more than you would imagine at first glance. We are asked to review so many books and I almost turned this one down because of the title. For years I have been a serious student of spirituality with many masters credits in theology. Because this subject is so dear to my heart and is a subject so very deep that many devotees have spent their lives trying to find the path to peace, I felt it was a sacriledge to try to find a shortcut. I thought it was impossible to think of shortcutting... but how wrong I was!  I am so very glad I not only read the book but spent many weeks studying it deeply and experiencing the various practices Gottfried suggests. How do I begin to review a book that has had so much personal impact in my life? Although I still dislike the title, this book is a deeply authentic and dedicated master guide to finding one's own path to deep peace and personal fulfillment through a spirit-based foundation and outlook on life, regardless of one's religious affiliation or lack thereof.  Dr. Gottfried is the clinical director of Advanced Wellness Programs and Advanced Cognitive Enhancement (ACE) Clinics and a consultant for the Canadian Centre for Integrative Medicine and Global Health Management. He was not a religious person as he set out to discover this Path to deep inner peace in order to help his patients with chronic pain, sleep disorders and cognitive difficulties from ongoing stress, so this is a terrific book for even athiests to read.  Anyone will reap the benefits of resolving pain from the past and learning to focus within and to develop habits that will create personal peace that comes from integration of our body, mind, and Spirit.  This peace will affect positively those around you and ultimately the whole world. Dr. Gottfried ably tells you step-by-step how to do this within your own life, not in \\"preachy or churchy\\" language but with the knowledge and professional experience of a respected psychologist and the insights and wisdom of personal experience of walking the path he teaches.  You could spend thousands of dollars in a counselor's office and not reap as many benefits as you will from this book.

In an, at first shocking, simile Rabbi Gafni explains that the Shachina love is the feminine side of God, and that the Holy of Holies and the Temple of Solomon were filled with male and female embracing figures to demonstrate that to be whole we must be in touch with both our male and female aspects of love.  For centuries the great Western religions have divorced themselves from the Shachina and embraced only the masculine concept of God.  Gafni uses human sexuality to reveal his points of emphasis of the need for us as humans and as Religious Traditions to unite the masculine and feminine in our concept of God and of the world, in order to promote the highest good for humankind and the Earth.  This is a beautifully written, thoroughly documented and researched book by a Rabbi of great wisdom, knowledge, and faith. It is a powerful acknowledgement for our times and can have important influence on Wester Faith today. It is great wisdom and insight in pleasant to read text, good reading for a trip or for daily meditation.	2005-01-08

DeStefano's idea of heaven is like a rich person's ideal sight-seeing tour, and he takes you on a real tour of all the places and experiences you will have if you live right and die good.  According to other reviews this is ideal for Christians who take the promises of gold paved streets and pearly gates literally, and it is of great comfort to dying patients and their families. I guess the book serves as a bright, fanciful tourist guide for people who need that kind of belief, but I prefer to think of Heaven as a place of deep mystery and no need of materialism, a place where God IS, and that will be all that matters to us then.	2005-01-08

Gordon Smith is a well-known medium from England who has denied, questioned, tried to hide, and then developed his abilities to communicate with the spirits of the dead. Now he devotes his time to helping people who are in great distress of grief have consolation or directions from the Other Side. His powers and abilities have been tested in many different ways scientifically and he has been verified each time as being authentic and not a fraud. He cannot explain how or why he has this ability, but through the deep questions he has asked through the decades he has gleaned much valuable information which is comforting and enlightening and dispells the fears we have about the after world. The documented accounts in this book are fascinating and will give you pause to question your own fears and perhaps to look more deeply at your own denied abilities.  A very interesting read that helps us learn about our consciousness, to overcome fears and doubts, and to accept what once seemed beyond belief, knowing that it just might be everyday normal.	2005-01-08

A Cruising Adventure of America's Great Loop	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Terrific Read...Even If You Don't Own a Boat	Honey, Let's Get a Boat\\"<br /><br />  by Ron and Eva Stob<br /><br />Here is a must read for not only boating enthusiasts but all those who ever imagined themselves pulling up stakes and setting out on a year or more adventure of travel.  Ron and Eva Stob do a wonderful job of recounting their year-long journey on a forty-foot trawler, which began in Florida and circled up along the intercoastal waterway to New York and then up the Hudson River to Lakes George and Champlain to the Saint Lawrence River in Canada and on to the Great Lakes and Chicago and then down the river systems to the Gulf of Mexico and back to Florida.  This route, known as \\"America's Great Loop,\\" took them through waterways, locks, scenery, history, and cultures as varied as one could find anywhere.<br /><br />Even though the book is written in the first person by Ron as the narrator, I can assure you, on the basis of having had the good fortune of meeting this delightful couple, Eva had a big part in helping relate the experiences encountered throughout their year of traveling these waterways. The book is a great read from start to finish and includes an appendix, which is a guidebook to anyone contemplating a similar venture. From the interesting and humorous aspects of just how this couple took the leap of quitting their jobs and finding and purchasing the trawler to their final encounter with the tropical storm Gordon,( becoming Hurricane Gordon,) as they returned to Florida after their year of cruising, the reader will be fascinated by vivid descriptions of places and cultures, as well as the difficulties and near disasters.  Ron's \\"tongue in cheek\\" satire and humor and his honest self-criticism enhance the imagery of the book and bring alive the characters and places.<br /><br />The book relates as much about the history and culture of the places visited along the way as it does the process of navigating the waterways.  Even though I had been to a number of places mentioned, I was not aware of all the history and cultural aspects the narrator reveals.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in travel, by whatever means, as it is just the thing for the intellectually curious.<br /><br />This book is published by Raven Cove Publishing of Greenback, Tennessee, and can be ordered at Raven Cove Publishing; P.O. Box 168, Greenback, TN 37742-0168 or phone 865/856-7888.  The book is also available through Amazon Books on the Internet.

Nelles Guide/Sweden by Gerhard Lemmer, Birgit Kramer, and Otto Steiger  not only gives the reader and traveler great information about the country but also is beautifully done with numerous exquisite photographs of all  regions of the country. The layout of the book is very user friendly from its captivating narration of the history and culture of Sweden to it's well organized information on 9 travel areas throughout the country as well as detailed discription and advice on the best way to get around and see all of the metropolis of Stockholm. Throughout each section on the various regions to be explored, excellent maps correlate places and points of scenic interest through numbering in the narrative that corresponds to numbers found on the maps of the region. This along with giving specific distances between places and time needed in travel gives the reader a great orientation. At the end of each section about a particular region the authors have added a helpful cataloging of hotels, restaurants, hostles, nightclubs, and significant points of interest by town or specific area with telephone numbers, dates open, and price range. By coming at the end of each section this information does not break up the flow of the narrative and detract from the enchantment of the area to be explored.<br /><br />The photography coupled with the narration made this one of the most enticing travel books I have read. I felt lured to Sweden and found myself facinated by the discriptions of what one would see and experience traveling through the countryside. The authors did a wonderful job of bringing in the main historical dates and happenings when describing a town or area without losing sight of the scenic interests. I found other travel books on Sweden did not give me a feeling for the country as this Nelles Guide did. Although some books like Frommer's Sweden gave more overall information, they lacked the wonderful pictures and narrative that bring out the character of the country. My desire to visit Sweden was greatly increased from reading Nelles Guide of the country; whereas, the other travel books on Sweden left me with no feeling for how Sweden might differ from any other European country. I would greatly recommend Nelles Guide to Sweden to those wishing to visit the country as well as anyone that would like to know what the country of Sweden is like.y.

It is not a narrative, as the four canonized Biblical gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but contains only the words which, according to \\"theTwin\\" who wrote it, are the direct teachings of Jesus, the Rabbi, to his Disciples.  This is the Wisdom He imparted only to his close inner circle. Similar to a koan, these cryptic teachings require great thought and are somewhat paradoxical and perplexing.  Dr. Bauman, whose academic credentials are numerous, has translated directly from the original Coptic Greek of the manuscripts which were only discovered in recent years.  Dr. Bauman offers this translation as a thought provoking study guide with inciteful questions to ponder in order to come to your own conclusion as to the meanings of these amazing Wisdom Teachings of Jesus.	2005-01-08
