Thomas's characters inhabit a Victorian London that comes to life before your eyes.  The story is narrated by a Watsonesque detective's assistant recently hired through a newspaper ad for a position with 'some danger involved.'  Though only 5'3 and with a checkered past including a questionable trip to the slammer, he finds himself hired on by London's most famed (and notorious) private investigator and immediately embroiled in the midst of a murder investigation.<br />Someone has murdered a prominent Jewish man and publicly displayed him crucified above the marketplace.  Is it a singular murder or the start of something bigger?  With racial tensions, backalley intrigue, religious zealotry, and murder, SOME DANGER INVOLVED is gripping, riveting fun.<br />The best elements of a mystery series, to me, are when you have individual cases to solve but also the slow unraveling of the personalities and back-stories of the sleuths.  There is so much to learn and know about our trusty main characters that I'm sure Mr. Thomas can keep the magic going into more volumes in this series.<br />Read it, and you will be as eager as I am to eat at Ho's secret restaurant as I am.  I can't WAIT for the next!  The best debut in the mystery genre in a long time.	2004-05-11

Characters are vivid and real, and the storyline is exciting as it moves toward an impending, explosive climax.<br />Peter Octavian is a bit of a loner in the vampire world.  Having left his blood father and coven, he lives on his own working as a detective.  We quickly find out that Octavian has made some realizations about vampire nature and the myths about them... crosses don't harm him, and he has even learned to walk in daylight!<br />As grisly murders occur in his hometown, he is drawn into a mystery surrounding a powerful book stolen from a secret chamber of a Vatican library and an ominous secret society in the Church desperate to have it back.  It may very well be the key to magic, sorcery, and the vampires themselves.<br />So exciting... I just started the second book, Angel Souls and Devil Hearts.  Loving it, too!	2003-06-18

The necromantic forces of Plenimar, sworn enemy of Skala, are pulling together all the pieces they need to assemble a powerful artifact that will ensure the defeat of Skala.  But Alec and Seregil and others are on hand to try to prevent that.<br />Along with the blossoming love-affair between Alec and Seregil and the mysteries surrounding both of their backgrounds, the tale is thrilling and exciting.

Orphan and roamer Alex is dragged through the world on the coattails of this mystery man, travels to faraway lands from his privincial home, and gets embroiled into the midst of great intrigue amidst the first churnings of war between two countries.<br />As the somewhat clueless, awkward young man begins to experience things he's never met up with before, you see a new fantasy world unfold in front of his eyes and your own (including some unrequited (so far!) man-to-man romance, always a plus in my book).<br />Great fun, great read, can't wait for more...	2003-01-10

Literary, Lyrical, Fantastical, Magical, Memorable.<br />Unbelievably brilliant, this is one of the best books I've read in a decade.  Truly memorable, Martell has created a new fable, a fantastical tale, an epic journey of survival both mental and physical, a character/narrator that is destined to become a cultural and literary icon.<br />If you think Harry Potter was a children's book that adults could also enjoy, then this is the truly brilliant work of literary grandness that can be enjoyed by a child, a young adult, as well as an adult.  Should be required reading in every 8th grade reading class.  Pangs of the wonderful writing grace of Shirley Jackson; elements reminiscent of The Odyssey; memorable characterization as destined for classic as Holden Caulfield.<br />Written in a sequence of 100 short chapters, LIFE OF PI is the perfect book for a parent and child to read (or read out loud) together.  Make this book a special event in your life.  Because once you start reading it, it will be.  Take turns with your child reading each chapter and hand the book back and forth.<br />But never mind the kids.  Read it, adults.  The story and character are as memorable as any you've read.<br />I'm not giving anything away.  I can't put my hardcover on a shelf.

Such a stunningly envisioned work!  The first-person narrative is so strong in point of view that you can picture Griet completely in your mind, see the choices she makes, and understand her.<br />GwaPE so vividly portrays 17th Century Delft that you begin to think in their terms and understand why the people act as they do within the social constructs of the time.  By the end of the novel, you are completely wrapped in the time.  The explanations of clothing, adornment, household objects, jobs, lifestyles are as vivid as a Vermeer painting.<br />Chevalier gets it just right!  Vermeer's amazing genius in his work is juat that: the portrayal of people as they were... and Chevalier mimics his genius beautifully.<br />I was in the Met Store this afternoon after finishing this one, and I picked up an artbook with all the Vermeers in it (all 35), and when I turned the page to Girl with a Pearl Earring, it had so much more power for me.  The whole novel blossomed for me in the eyes of the girl.<br />Truly amazing.	2002-05-22

The young narrator lives in a community of the future where all citizens are selected for their jobs and trained at the age of 13.  There is no choice in this society but thereby also no haves and havenots.  The citizens live happily in their roles and don't question what they have or what they don't have.  Because everyone, everything is the same.  No one has ever known suffering or hunger or need, but in having never known it, they don't even know what it is.  When he is selected as the receiver of memories, our narrator realizes that the world has not always been the way it is.  And in so learning, he starts to question whether everything is always for the best.<br />An amazing work that will make you think about society, community, risk, and choice.  Will spark many deep thoughts and discussion.  A great read that will definitely make you think about society, structure, and opportunity.	2002-05-20

Geez, it had to be, what 3,000 pages, to get through the whole work?  Mr. Williams' characterization is phenomenal.  Every person in the epic lives and breathes.  His serializing style can get very taxing as he jumps from group to group telling his huge-in-scope story.  But in the end, it's the people who've made it work.  The vividness of detail more than makes up for the choppiness and the mind-numbing length of the work.<br />Now mind you he's no Mark Twain.  The unbelievable size of this trilogy (which had to be published in four volumes in paperback because it defies the physics of paper and glue!) is enough to stay away.  But if you love big sprawling epic fantasy, this is surely one to try out.<br />I can't say I'll ever start that darn Wheel of Time series, because this one almost killed me.  But if you're a fast reader, you may be able to finish this one off between two Aedonmass festivals.	2002-04-24

American Gods is this Brit author's search for the real America.  If you want to read a novel that attempts to capture the soul of America, this is it.  Man, this bizarre fantastical journey reaches for it and finds it.  The idea?  As America was created by the great melting pot, those who came here brought their culture, their lifestyle, basically, their gods.  And those gods are still here, wallowing in half forgotten-ness, but still fighting for survival.<br />It is a grand work.  Read it.  If you want to think about what it is to be part of America.  If you want to think about how new culture and old culture combine and merge, how ideas fade through the ages, like an old forgotten god, read it.<br />For me it was even more vivid after recent events to read a novel like this.  I think Gaiman says it best in his acknowledgments, where he buried his most sturring statement, and here since I don't have the book with me, I will destroy his comment and misquote him, but it goes something like, and thanks to my family for putting up with my while I went looking for America, which ended up to be in America all along.<br />Thanks, Neil.

WICKED and CONFESSIONS... are two of my favorite reads.  Now with LOST, this is Maguire's first real journey into creating characters from the ground up, not basing them on previously told stories (but still adding in flavor from classic work, this time Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge).  And he succeeds admirably.  I don't think there's been such a three-dimensional flawed main character from any other book I've read that lives so vivdly in the mind with all of her internal torment, angst, and unconscious railing.  The whole time you're reading, you want to shake her and yell, 'what's the matter with you?'<br />And of course, like any good book, just when you think you've got her torment completely figured out, LOST has turns you didn't expect.  Really great writing.<br />Of course, I have to admit, it wasn't what I was expecting after having read the previous works by Maguire, but I was pleasantly surprised at this latest effort.  He's branching out, he's growing as a writer, and doggoneit, I'll go with him.	2002-03-08

The hero Kevin is haunted by his 'shadow' who literally embodies all the bad sides of his character and past.  Through solidly constructed chapters (especially a few right in the middle of this book, which are downright brilliant), Kevin both looks back at his past and confronts his shadow again after years.<br />At points the novel has very obviously been stitched together from many separate short works (as author admits in the preface), but once you get into the storyline and the reality as weaved together by the author, you'll let yourself go on a spook tour of Kevin's psyche.<br />Inventive, clever, unique, vivid, pervasive.<br />Someone recently said to me, 'I like books in which as a reader I'm not 100% sure of what's going on.'  Me too.	2001-05-29

Harris creates such a visually stimulating world in the pages, I can already see the scenes in my head.  A scrumptious treat of a book, you'll enjoy every detail, every line.  The village of characters comes alive in full dimension with their quirks and personalities and flaws.<br />If just a bit heavy-handed in the portrayal of the two feuding sides, Vianne and the local priest, Chocolat is still a wonderfully rounded story full of a fabulous cast of secondary characters, each with their own storyline.  Everyone in the story learns or grows a bit, and you'll enjoy the ride!<br />Read it!  Really great!	2001-05-07

Everything is right about this wonderful novel.  Most good books tell a story that doesn't leave your mind right away.  This book has a handful of them!  Every chapter is a complete world of real characters.  Each one could be a novel to itself.  But Vreeland has woven them together into a beautiful storyline and has an amazing ability to fill every word, every sentence with meaning and vision.<br />I commute to work, and I read books on the train.  I finished this book last night, and today I did not bring a book with me.  Instead I stood with my eyes closed and thought about this book the whole way, and the opening sentence of this review is what it led me to.

It's that kind of detail that maybe someone who's done this before would call 'basic.'

I bought it when I was house-hunting for my first investment property, and boy, did it help.  Truly priceless (with a CD!).<br />Maybe this would work as a very-first book on real estate.  Since I had already read several books and purchased my first investment property (a one-family house) by the time I bought and read it, I am not in a good position to say so.  But frankly it is so light-weight, I would recommend you just look elsewhere for another introductory title that would be more worth its weight (and price tag).<br />Better yet, buy two or three other books, read them, and then you'll be just as knowledgeable as this author and can get an advance from a publishing company to write a book yourself.

So I am giving it three stars.  And I intend on finishing the series.  But I do wish more would happen.  It is a bit trying at times to read through the second 700-page volume and see how very little happens.  While things do happen, they are subtle changes.  For 700-pages now the characters are journeying toward a gathering place, the Stone of Farewell, and after 700 pages, one would expect some type of finality.  I am a firm believer in the idea that each book in a trilogy or series must stand alone on its own merits and if it were to be picked up alone and read, it would be a full, complete story.  If I look at it that way, The Stone of Farewell is a disappointment.<br />Middle books are hard (just ask Ms. Rowling), but nonetheless, after 1,400 pages, Mr. Williams has yet to key in the reader completely on the goals of the two sides of his conflict.  Near the end of The Stone of Farewell, one character stands up and says, &quot;I know what's going on here, and let me tell you...&quot;  So much for her...  I wish the author would do the same thing.<br />If I had to do it over again, I can't promise you I would have started this.  But now I have to finish.

If you like character-driven novels depicting full, three-dimensional real people, read The Hours.  If you love Virginia Woolf or remember Mrs. Dalloway fondly, this is a no-brainer -- you must read The Hours.  It's a classically written work delving into the nature of our existence and our everyday lives.  What inspires us?  What keeps us going?  So with that said, if you're not a fan of a novel unless it is a cliff-hanging, suspense novel in which things blow up and crimes are committed, then definitely definitely move on.  Oh there is suspense (lots of it), but it is in more of a British novel vein (I know something has to happen, but gosh darn it, what?  and when?), and Cunningham pays off.  If you like the works of Woolf, Forster, Ishiguro, this is time well spent (pun intended).  Worthy of its Pulitzer.  Read through to the very end.  The last two pages are amazing.	2000-12-29
US	52863103	R3QW9UU4YHBDBX	0679436154	851243413	The Diagnosis: A Novel	Books	4	9	11	N	N	A good book from my favorite author	Mr. Lightman has created an amazing portrait of modern day life.  How many numbers, statistics, details does Bill Chalmers have to deal with on the first two pages of the book alone?  If you haven't realized it yet, there is something wonderful in this book that people react to.  Bill Chalmers is Martin Dressler in the information age.  He is me (you?) on every bad day in the office.  He's everyone on a cellphone on the 7:49 am train.  Did you ever feel like a 60 watt lightbulb being fed 120 watts of power all day every day?  If you've ever wondered about what the consequences of that could be, buy and read this book.<br />I left off the 5th star because of the vagueness of detail that sometimes got in my way.  As some have mentioned, sometimes I just wasn't getting the reason for the Greek storyline. I think I do now, but still I'm not completely convinced.  And I really still don't understand what it is Plymouth (Bill's company) does.  And well, yes, frankly, it's a bit too much like American Beauty.  Granted, that doesn't mean this is less of a work on its own merits, but that is something off with regard to uniqueness.<br />Buy this book, and buy Einstein's Dreams, too.	2000-12-18

I have read many children's books in which a horrible mess or bad event takes place and through an impossible, over-the-top, unbelievable, sugar-sweet course of events (Holes by Louis Sachar, for example), everything turns out hunky-dorey, right-as-rain, golly-gee-great in the end.  The Bad Beginning turns that sap around 100% and offers an hysterical Series of Unfortunate Events, in which Murphy's Law prevails at every turn.  The characters are delightful, the story-telling is fantastic, and the tone, especially the running vocabulary lessons, is light-hearted and personal.  Now I have to stop writing this review so I can go start the second book.	2000-11-29

Well, kudos to the young author for writing a novel at her age.  She is an inspiration.  And deserves all the publicity she received.  And way to go  in even getting taken seriously by an agent and a publishing company.   Those are her two stars!  What an amazing accomplishment.<br />But alas, it's  a real world out there.  There's not much in this slim volume to get  excited over.  You never get a sense of why the main character is so bitter  and has held a grudge for 300 years.  And why now after all this time does  she decide it's time to act upon it?  What was the spark that led the  events of this story to take place?  And please remember, you can't wrap it  all up with a surprise in one page at the end.<br />Reading about vampires is  always fun to me.  But a book has to come from somewhere and lead you  somewhere.<br />Admirable.	2000-09-19

It is a good read, very solidly constructed story.  But most of the hype and flap copy alludes to  the one, single, three-page long catalog description in the last chapter.   Martin Dressler seems to be a long-winded, drawn-out short story that could  have been summed up in a nice 25-page structure.<br />Reviews and flap copy  talk about a fatal flaw in the character.  I thought we would have a good  traditional tragedy in this novel, but the main character is  two-dimensional and just plods on page to page.  I don't find a great  personality here.  Most of the characterization I brought to my reading of  the story I got from what the flap copy told me I was supposed to think of  him.  It doesn't really exist on the printed page.<br />A nice little book.   Extremely good marketing hype.  Read it if you want, but with 85,000 or  more books published every year, there's got to be something else in the  amazon database you would find more entertaining.  Keep searching, keep  searching, you'll find it...	2000-08-09

I use it to keep track of secondary holidays and events and promote products at appropriate times.  If you are in retail or  consumer products, it can be fun and creative to notify customers of Arbor  Day, Flag Day, religious holidays, famous people birthdays,...and promote  your products or create displays for them.<br />GREAT for teachers, parents,  store-owners, and anyone who cares.....<br />I'm writing this review on June  22.  I hope all in Boise enjoy the River Festival.  And if you're in  Luling, TX, I hope you win the annual watermelon seed-spitting contest.   Oh!  And I almost forgot: Happy Birthday Lindsay Wagner!  And to all you  contestants in the Miss Virginia pageant: Love your hair!  Hope it wins!	2000-06-22

The firsttime I couldn't put it down and read right through.  The second time,I read one chapter at a time (pun intended), thinking and rethinking. And each time since it just makes me smile.<br />Lightman's ability to create a tableau around the scene he describes is nothing less than magical.  As you begin to read this thought-provoking little treasure, you quickly realize that either Lightman or Einstein is there with you, and you are not reading.  You are being read to.<br />If you like to think about time and the world, this book will blow your mind.  If you just love reading wonderful books and discovering amazing new ways to look at the world, you will hug this one to your breast and re-read it as many times as I have.<br />The chapter that describes time running backwards is still a favorite cocktail party conversation for me.  And drives everyone I know to find this book and read every chapter.	2000-06-16

Set in post-flood Florence, the narrator is an out-of-sorts American girl (think a cross between Bridget Jones and a Margaret Atwood  whiner) off to help save the wonders of the city from the ravages of  nature.  Little does she know that it was herself that she was really off  to save.  Caught in the intriguing situation of finding an old erotic  manuscript in the library of the local abbey, she analyzes her own desires  and life.	2000-05-23

(Every Landlord's Legal Guide, 1998)	Books	5	84	85	N	Y	I couldn't recommend this book ENOUGH!	This book has helped through every step of buying my first investment property. It's like having your own professional standing over your shoulder, reminding you about every detail of every step. The section on insurance alone is completely priceless, pointing out that a landlord needs not just property loss coverage but also personal liability. And not just physical liability, but coverage of potential slander, libel, discrimination, unlawful eviction, invasion of privacy suits... And don't forget loss of rents! It's that kind of detail that maybe someone who's done this before would call 'basic.' But I admit: I am no pro, yet when I called an insurance agent and explained what I wanted coverage for, he said to me,	2000-03-03

I told everyone I knew to read it.  Many did and agreed with me that it was special.  Like Marion Zimmer  Bradley before him (Mists of Avalon), Maguire looks at a popular myth/story  and turns the point of view on its head.  Now in CONFESSIONS he puts a name  and personality on a face long misunderstood, the ugly stepsister.  There  is something so much more on target in his telling of this story than  WICKED that his story here rings even more true.  Maybe it's trying to do a  little bit less in the book and crafting a solid tight storyline, maybe  it's a more personal touch and a true love of his character, maybe it's the  lack of some overarching political statement he isn't chasing down (as in  WICKED).  But CONFESSIONS packs a huge surge of emotion that won't leave  you when you finish it.  I finished it a week ago, and I'm still mulling it  over in my mind.  Clara reminds us of all those beautiful people out there  who either think the world revolves around them or that it should.  Thank  you, Mr. Maguire.  What's next?  I can hardly wait!	1999-12-04

Well, I, an adult reader, picked it up since it won the Newbery, and I can't imagine why.  It's far too contrived and unbelievable to be taken as worthy.  Honestly, the last name of Yelnats just to make a palindrome.  And  coincidence is packed on top of coincidence, descendant after descendant  showing up in the story, it's just far too much for an adult to stomach.   *Burp!*	1999-04-01
