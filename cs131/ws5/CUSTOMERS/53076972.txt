She was tired, her bookings were down at Hillside Manor, her bed and breakfast and her mother Gertrude hadn't been opening the mail from the Movie Studio that was making her life story into a film, thereby missing a $20,000 check that had been sitting around for months.<br /><br />She perked up a little when her cousin Serena (Renie) Jones calls to say she's going on a cruise.  It seems one of her graphic artist clients had moved their headquarters to San Francisco and in her fear of losing her biggest client had her brother-in-law, Bub, a lawyer  write a few letters, resulting in her keeping them as a client and getting a free cruise as well.<br /><br />Although Renie was planning on taking her husband Bill, a semi-retired psychiatrist, that hadn't worked out.  One of Bill's clients was threatening to jump off a building and Bill was trying to talk him down. As he was afraid of heights, Bill had to stand on the ground, shouting up at the poor man.  And Renie was afraid the guy wasn't going to jump, so Bill would have to treat him after he came down, so she wanted Judith to be ready on a moments notice to go on the cruise.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as Renie said, Bill managed to talk the guy down so she and Judith were on their way to San Francisco.  The cruise was going to have 1930's theme with everyone dressing in vintage clothes.  The first item on the list was exclusive prelaunch party with a small group of guests, including:<br /><br />Magglio & Consuela Cruz - owner of the cruise line.<br /><br />Rich San Francisco Matron, Erma Giddon, her daughter Anemone,  Anemone's fiancee, Jim Brooks - a Stanford pre-med student and Mrs. Giddon's private secretary - Ambrose Everhart.<br /><br />Horace Pankhurst - The Giddon family financial advisor and his bimbo girlfriend, CeeCee.<br /><br />Rick & Rhoda St. George - wealthy, young married couple straight from a 1930's detective story.<br /><br />The prelaunch party turns out to be a flop when Magglio Cruz winds up stabbed to death, hidden in the piano.<br /><br />Then Mrs. Giddon's jewelry disappears.<br /><br />Then Dixie Beales, cruise director, who found Magglio in the piano is poisoned and Emile Grenier, the ship's purser is strangled.<br /><br />Judith & Renie's are accused of the jewelry heist and they decide they better start investigating this crime before they're arrested for the murder of three people.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Renie, who will do and say anything.  She is the best sidekick in any mystery series.<br /><br />Judith is a very realistic character.  I love her husband Joe, who's always supportive and her mother Gertrude, who is a very funny, grumpy old lady.<br /><br />Oscar - a stuffed ape that Renie and her husband Bill act and treat as if it's a real animal.  Renie is almost hysterical when after talking the jumper down, he kidnaps Oscar and request a ransom of $65 and a helicopter.  They also have another doll that they treat as if it's alive and a live bunny that has a complete wardrobe for any occasion.<br /><br />Bill Jones, who's afraid of heights, trying to talk the jumper down by standing in front of the building using a bullhorn to talk to him.  The only reason Oscar was in danger was Renie had to bring him to the building so Bill could take a little nap between talks to the guy, and he needed Oscar for his nap. (And you thought your family was strange)<br /><br />Biff McDougal, an idiot of a homicide investigator.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Not enough of the regular supporting characters, including Phyliss her cleaning lady, Renie's mother, Deb, Sweetum's, Judith's obnoxious cat are all missed.<br /><br />Rick & Rhoda St. George: These two characters practically took over the entire storyline.  They're supposed to be a knock off of Nick & Nora Charles, but I only found them irritating.  This reminded me of TV shows where characters are brought in to be introduced so they can be spun off intotheir own series.  I certainly hope this isn't the case with these two.<br /><br />Not the best entry in the series, but it's lively and moves along quickly.  Even a bad Mary Daheim book is better than a lot of other mysteries you might pick up.ght in to be introduced so they can be spun off into their own series.

There are rats in her kitchen and she is going to have to move out while the problem and other emergency work is taken care of.  This could take weeks.<br /><br />Fortunately, Dolly, one of her customer's at the store is going away for a few weeks and wants Claire to housesit for her.<br /><br />So she moves into the palatial estate with her daughter Caron and Caron's best friend Inez.  What could be more perfect?<br /><br />Not this.  No sooner does she move in than Caron and Inez claim to have found a dead body in the back yard.  The body has disappeared by the time the police show up and Claire tries to convince herself that the girls really hadn't seen anything.<br /><br />Then things start to get strange.  Madison and Sara Louise, claiming to be nieces of Dolly show up and claim their car had broken down while coming down to see Dolly and they needed a place to stay.<br /><br />Other strange people seem to be lurking around the area and when Claire see's a dead body in the yard, which also disappears before the police can show up makes her worried about everyone's safety, which proves true, when the much seen dead body shows up in the freezer in the garage.<br /><br />Who is the man?  What was he doing there.  Where is Dolly, who has disappeared and appears not to be who she says she is.  What is going on, why are the FBI investigating  and are they in danger?<br /><br />Claire decides to investigate with the help of Lt. Peter Rosen, \\"her boyfriend\\" the web of secrets, lies and more murders as she wonders if maybe they shouldn't have stayed at the \\"Dew Drop Inn.\\"<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Claire Malloy, she is a very adult acting character.  Serious-minded, but you almost have to be if you're a widow raising a teenager alone and trying to get along on an iffy business like a book store.<br /><br />Peter Rosen, who is a great boyfriend and friend.  He doesn't like her investigating, but helps all he can because he knows he won't be able to stop her.<br /><br />Caron and her best friend Inez.  Typical middle of the group teenagers, they're not in the \\"A\\" group of teenagers, although they want to be, but they're not in the \\"Z\\" group either. They are actually the funniest characters in these books.<br /><br />A complex mystery.  A lot of twists and turns.  A very quick read.<br /><br />The sci-fi fan pot-head, who spends most of his time trying to shop lift from her store.  He's been in since the first of this series and add just a touch of humor whenever he appears.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />For the first time, Claire does some really dumb things.  When you're house sitting, you don't let two total strangers move in without asking the home owner.  And when they're obnoxious, and insulting to your daughter and her friend, treating them like maids and making it miserable for them to live in the house you throw them out.  I didn't understand Claire's insisting that they stay, except as a plot maneuver to move the story along.<br /><br />Except for Peter & Inez there aren't a lot of reoccurring characters that appear in this book.  Claire needs a wider circle of friends.<br /><br />Minor problems, but still a very good read.<br /><br /> I think this series has one of the longest time between books, the last book \\"Out On A Limb\\" came out in 2002 and it was a little difficult to get back into the characters.<br /><br />Check out Joan Hess's, Maggody series, with Arly Hanks.  I don't enjoy it as much as the Claire Malloy series, but it's also a good series.end.

There seems to be a lot of suspects.<br /><br />Her sister Zoe, who had been the pretty one until the TV show and was now had become overweight and unattractive.  Was she angry enough that as the actual clothes designer behind Amanda's new line of clothing she wasn't getting enough publicity?<br /><br />Yvette Powers - an old friend and owner of \\"Snazzy Jane\\" the boutique where the clothes line was being premiered.  She was a little upset that her husband and Amanda had gotten a little too close.<br /><br />Greg Spaulding - the doctor who had performed the surgery and had briefly been engaged to Amanda afterwards.<br /><br />Or did it have something to do with the disappearance of Caleb Collingwood, Amanda's old boyfriend, whom she had dropped, as soon as, she became beautiful and had mysteriously disappeared years ago, leading to the rumors that Amanda had killed him.<br /><br />With the list of suspects a mile long, it would take all of Lacey's skill to find the killer and to do it without letting her mother and sister who were visiting from Colorado finding out what she was doing.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Lacey is smart and her investigations would actually lead to a solution as opposed to the killer just suddenly telling her that they're the killer.<br /><br />Her friends, Brooke - who's a lawyer but dates Damon, who has an internet site devoted to conspiracies and the two of them believe in every conspiracy theory that comes along.<br /><br />Her fellow employee's at the \\"Eye\\".

Lacey had a huge crush on him years ago when he was a sheriff in Steamboat Springs and she was a reporter.  Although nothing ever came of that, this is their second chance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think this relationship is a bust.  In the last book, Vic was away for months and never bothered to call or write her.  This book his ex-wife shows up and he seems more interested in entertaining her than in Lacey, except to tell her not to get involved in solving the murder.  There is just no spark there.<br /><br />He'd probably be ok if it wasn't for the fact that Tony Trujillo is the perfect guy for her.<br /><br />I don't know if this is intentional or if Vic is just a badly written character and he's supposed to be a much better character than he reads to me.<br /><br />This entire series, so far is funny, wonderfully written and a definite must read.ds, Brooke - who's a lawyer but dates Damon, who has an internet site devoted to conspiracies and the two of them believe in every conspiracy theory that comes along.

What else could go wrong?<br /><br />Abby Knight, owner of \\"Bloomers\\" hadn't thought things could get worse.  Not only was she the florist at the wedding, but a bridesmaid (In a hideous clown gown) and grandma sitter, for the 90 year old grandmother of the groom.<br /><br />Plus she had to convince her cousin Jillian (a many times engaged but never made it to the altar, bride) that she really, really, really did want to marry Claymore Osborne.<br /><br />Then the groomsman she was paired with is injured and can't make the wedding and Jillian expects her to find a substitute.<br /><br />Fortunately, her \\"boyfriend\\" Marco Salvare, owner of \\"Down The Hatch Bar And Grill\\" agrees to escort her down the aisle.<br /><br />Then she loses grandma at the reception, only to find her outside at the gazebo having found a dead body, which turns out to be Jack Snyder, who had recently got out of jail.<br /><br />Who would want this former jailbird dead?<br /><br />What about Jillian's cousin Melanie who Jack had gotten pregnant and then dumped her, never seeing or supporting their daughter.<br /><br />Or Melanie's father, Josiah (Just because he got into a fight and beat Jack up in the middle of the wedding shouldn't put him at the top of the list should it?)<br /><br />But the police seem to be more interested in Richard Davis, who was dating Abby's friend and employee Grace. It's Grace who asks Abby to help find the real killer before Richard is tried and convicted of a murder she's sure he didn't commit.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />This is a wonderful series.  This is the third book and it just keeps getting better.  Abby is a very believable character.<br /><br />Her boyfriend Marco fits perfectly with her.  He doesn't constantly tell her to stop investigating, but instead, (as a former cop) helps her all he can.<br /><br />Abby's family.  Everyone except her father is crazy, but you just love them.<br /><br />Nikki, her best friend and roommate, employee's Grace and Lottie, clients like Trudee DeWitt and her wonderful cat, Simon have all become more involved in the storyline.  In the first book, Abby was pretty much a lone wolf, doing everything herself and didn't have a lot of interaction with other characters, but that has improved over each book.<br /><br />Pryce Osborne - Abby's former fiancee, and brother of the groom,  who dumped her when she dropped out of law school.  He is such a jerk that you just love the zingers Abby sends his way.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />I did figure out the killer a little before Abby, but that doesn't interfere with the story at all.<br /><br />Abby could use a little more backbone when dealing with her family.<br /><br />Overall a very good entry in this series.kki, her best friend and roommate, employee's Grace and Lottie, clients like Trudee DeWitt and her wonderful cat, Simon have all become more involved in the storyline.

Detroit psychic Abby Cooper was just going to help out her friend, Kendal by reading some Tarot cards at a wedding.  (What kind of nut has Tarot Card readings at their wedding).  That should have been her first clue that things weren't going to go well.<br /><br />Her second clue was while doing a reading, she realizes that the man, wearing a mask, (As are all the guests) sitting in front of her is a hit man who's killed a lot of people.<br /><br />Leaving the wedding in a hurry, Abby isn't too pleased when she realizes that she had just been doing psychic readings at a mob wedding.<br /><br />She's even less pleased the next day when the mob boss, Andros, father of the bride, has her hauled to his house.  It seems he has a little problem with having paid for two Tarot card readers at his little girl's wedding, only to have them run out at the beginning.  He'd like his money back and he'd like her to do a little job for him, find his wife, who disappeared over twenty years ago and hasn't been seen since.<br /><br />Abby has enough on her plate, as she's helping the police find a masked man who has been attacking women and killed his last victim, so she turns down the job, although she does write a huge check to cover their leaving.<br /><br />The mob isn't that easy to put off and Abby finds herself not only trying to outrun the mob but convince the police that they've arrested the wrong man and worrying about her boyfriend, \\"Dutch\\" who is on his first assignment as an FBI agent with his superior, a gorgeous woman who seems to want more than a partner relationship with him.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Although I don't believe in psychics, the character of Abby Cooper is very believable.<br /><br />I love that fact that she has several different storylines going on at one time.  A lot of characters and a lot of things happening which really get you into the story.<br /><br />Dutch - the almost perfect boyfriend.<br /><br />Kendal - who finds his boyfriend in bed with another man when they get home from the wedding and running off to think things over, taking the mob bosses money with him, leaving Abby holding the bag.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Minor one.  Why if Milo (Dutch's former partner on the police force), asks her to help find the killer and listens to her clues, suddenly acts as if he doesn't believe in her psychic ability when she says he's arrested the wrong person.<br /><br />This also goes to Dutch who had seen Abby doing incredible things in the previous stories, suddenly act as if he didn't really believe she had any abilities at all.<br /><br />Great heroine, and a very enjoyable series.br /> <br />Kendal - who finds his boyfriend in bed with another man when they get home from the wedding and running off to think things over, taking the mob bosses money with him, leaving Abby holding the bag.   <br /> <br />Lowlights: <br /> <br />Minor one.

Although killing the lawyer isn't the right way to handle anything.<br /><br />Kendra is really dumb about how she investigates the crime, which seems to be her deciding someone is the killer and then meeting with them to accuse them of the crime.  She does this several times.

That is if he and his band can stop beating each other up.<br /><br />Things get really hot when a fire breaks out at the high school and Logan Wolf, lead singer winds up dead.<br /><br />Skye is determined not to get involved in the investigation, but when Sheriff Wally seems to have Vince in his sights again as the murder suspect, Skye decides she has to act.<br /><br />Could Logan's murder have anything to do with the rumors of drugs in the school?  Or maybe it had something to do with Logan refusing to sell Moss Green his farmland so Moss could put up Pig In A Poke - his amusement park.<br /><br />Wally isn't too pleased with her investigations, he's running for mayor and he's hassled at every press conference about the fact that he can't solve a crime and has to rely on a citizen to do the investigating.<br /><br />Even after several attempts on her life, Skye continues her search until she comes face to face with the murderer.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Skye's family.  Her parents and godfather Charlie and brother Vince are very close and obviously adore Skye.<br /><br />Sheriff Wally.  I've like him since the first book, he doesn't mind Skye investigating usually, but doesn't like the fact that she takes unnecessary risks.<br /><br />Justin And Frannie, two somewhat geeky high school students who work on the school paper and do a lot of undercover investigation.  They come across a lot of clues that they then pass on to Skey.<br /><br />May's cement goose that she dresses up on her front lawn.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Skye - I'm beginning to wonder if there is something wrong with this woman.  She surprised at her brother censure of Logan sleeping with a groupie, after all Vince has quite a reputation.  Skye obvioiusly doesn't think there is a difference between the single Vince being with someone and the married Logan being with someone.<br /><br />Skye gets into trouble several times when she should have given some information to Wally, he didn't answer her phone calls and when she went to the station she realized his ex-wife Darleen was intercepting the messages, so next time when she really needs to tell him something and he doesn't call her back, does she go to his house and tell him?  Of course not, she'll do it in the morning, afterall what could happen before then?  Justin and Frannie show more intelligence in their investigating than she does.<br /><br />Bunny - the mother of Simon (Skye's boring boyfriend).  Fortunately, she is only in a few pages of the book.  I cannot stand this character, Skye finds her refreshing after having to put up with her overbearing mother.  I suppose she would have liked it if her mother ran out on her and her father, came back several times and ran off again, the last time twenty years ago when she not only ran off but took all the money out of her husband's savings account.  That's the kind of mother Bunny was to Simon.<br /><br />As I said in my earlier review of this series.  Skye picked the wrong boyfriend. Simon, local funeral parlor owner and coroner is ok, but there are absolutely no sparks between Skye and him.<br /><br />Skye seems so flaky at times that I would wonder about her abilities at her job in helping troubled kids.<br /><br />This is a strange series where I find that everyone but the heroine, her boyfriend and his mother are so wonderful you want to continue reading about them.  The mystery itself is very good. A lot of clues but no cheating on the ending, although I suspected who the killer was but wasn't confirmed until the end.<br /><br />It's not too late to dump Simon and his mother.n.

This is the fifth Scumble River Mystery: Murder of a small town honey, Murder of a sweet old lady, Murder of a sleeping beauty, Murder of a snake in the grass.  There is also a short story in the anthology book, Drop Dead Blonde, but is the first I'm reviewing.<br /><br />The short story was what I read first and it was just barely interesting enough to get me to buy this series, which have turned out to be interesting but frustrating and this book is the worst, and seems to contain all the problems I noticed in the other books.<br /><br />Skye Denison is a school psychologist, who was fired from her first job in New Orleans and dumped by her fiancee, she couldn't get a job anywhere, so was forced to come back home to Scumble River, Illinois which she had insulted in her high school valedictorian speech a dozen years before.<br /><br />Skye and her boyfriend Simon have joined Scumble River's Social Club where Sky finds herself being invited to such events as Instant Gourmet food night at the home of Ken and Barbie Addison.  Reluctantly, Skye purchases some of the food, just so she can get out of there.<br /><br />Things are even worse when she stops by in a snow storm to pick up the food only to find Ken, strangled on the floor and Barbie strangled and hidden in the freezer.  Why would someone want to kill Ken, who's a doctor or Barbie?<br /><br />With everyone, including Wally the police chief asking her to help solve the crime, Skye puts on her detective cap and searches for the killer of what looks like a perfect couple, and uncovers some truly nasty secrets being hidden by the Scumble River residents.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Skye's family, from her parents to her hairdresser brother Vince, aunts, uncles and cousins are a close-knit family, who are like a lot of families, arguing but still loving each other.<br /><br />Wally, I love the police chief.  He doesn't mind Skye getting involved in the investigations, as long as she lets him know what she's doing.  He had been a rookie cop when Sky, a fifteen year old had developed a crush on him, which he had handled perfectly without taking advantage or embarrassing her.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Skye. I don't know how she can get on with her daily life since she obviously has no backbone. She constantly complains about how she wants to stand on her own, she's in her thirties, but lets her mother clean her house, her father & godfather buy her a car and generally take care of all of her problems.  She always complaining, but doesn't do anything to stop them.  And she picked the wrong boyfriend.<br /><br />Simon - her boyfriend, coroner and owner of the funeral home.  He's ok, but most women, with a backbone would not have gone out with him after the way he treated her on their first two meetings. (Read Murder Of A Small Town Honey). Skye tends to start acting like a fourteen year old when she's around any man.<br /><br />Bunny - Simon's mother.  This woman walked out on Simon and her husband over thirty years ago to become a dancer, she had come home a couple of times, claiming she would give it up, the last time was twenty years ago when not only did she leave, but stole all the savings from the bank on her way out.  Simon doesn't want to have anything to do with this woman, but Skye is determined they are going to get together.  This woman is a vulgar pig, which is trying to pass itself off as being eccentric. Fortunately, she just showed up in this book, so you can have four books to read before she appears.  Her character was one of the reasons I was hesitant about getting the series, as she is in the short story.<br /><br />Skye is another example of characters in books who claim they have to do something because it would hurt another person's feelings or not be polite.  TOO  BAD.  Bunny shows up one night claiming to be Simon's mother and Skye just lets her move in, without even asking for any ID.<br /><br />The mysteries are interesting and if you can stand the frustration of wanting to smack the heroine upside the head, this is an ok series to read while waiting for something better.nd the frustration of wanting to smack the heroine upside the head, this is an ok series to read while waiting for something better.	2005-07-01

Somehow Helen thought a Bridal Salon would be a nice place to work.  Happy brides wanting to make their special day perfect.<br /><br />That was before she met a running stream of Bridezilla's and their mothers.  The worse is Desiree Shenrad, a true mouse and her tyrannical, rich and obnoxious mother Kiki, who not only makes all the decisions on the wedding, but seems to have even picked out the groom.<br /><br />It doesn't seem that big of a loss when Kiki winds up dead, stuffed in a closet at the wedding.  Except that Helen's fingerprints seem to be all over the place and the police are giving her a second look.<br /><br />To prevent them from finding out who she is, Helen decides to investigate and discover who really wanted this mother-of-the-bride dead.  Her ex-husband, her daughter, the prospective son-in-law, an actor that she wouldn't let take a part because it was degrading?  What about Millicent, the bridal shop owner who had threatened her, or the chauffeur who thought she was leaving him a lot of money in her will, but was actually getting ready to dump him.<br /><br />With this list of suspects, Helen hoped it wouldn't take too long to find the killer, or the police may just uncover her hidden identity first.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />The mystery was pretty good, a lot of suspects and Helen does actually investigate and finds clues which lead her to the killer.<br /><br />The romance of Margery - Helen's landlady and new resident Warren who teaches dancing.<br /><br />We didn't have to read the long drawn out version of why Helen's hiding.<br /><br />Lowlights.<br /><br />This series has been improving since the first book which I disliked, but this one is a set-back.<br /><br />The mystery was ok, but not only is Kiki such a horrible person that you don't care that she gets killed, you also don't care about anyone else.  I hated them all.<br /><br />Phil - formerly Phil the pothead whose true identity came out in the last book and is now Helen's new boyfriend.  I think Phil was a better character when he was unseen and only talked about.<br /><br />Why do so many people in these books always have to be ridiculously polite, Phil letting his ex-wife, who is trying to get him back move in with him while she's in town, even though he knows it upsets Helen and he can hear her crying about it.  \\"She doesn't have anywhere to stay, so I have to let her stay here.\\"  In real life you'd tell her to get a hotel and maybe, just maybe pay for a few nights there if she's pleading poverty.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the next book will be better.ormerly Phil the pothead whose true identity came out in the last book and is now Helen's new boyfriend.

It probably wouldn't have been so bad if the contents weren't a pile of bones.  And even worse a billfold with the identification of Ricco Martinez, Nadia's abusive ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />Things get worse when Detective Will Richeaux (who had been having an affair with Charlotte's niece and former partner Judith) decides Danny is the perfect suspect.  It doesn't help when Nadia runs away.<br /><br />Was Detective Richeaux getting back at Judith for dumping him, by arresting her brother?  Or was he really just a sleazy snake, as Charlotte's friend and next door neighbor, former cop Louis said.<br /><br />Charlotte decides she has to investigate to save Danny from being railroaded, but the problem wasn't so much who would have wanted Ricco dead, but who didn't want him dead.<br /><br />Highlights.<br /><br />I love the relationship between Charlotte and Louis.  Sometimes she wants them to have a closer relationship and then he says something that makes her mad at him for days.<br /><br />The mystery was very good, nice surprise ending.  Logical but never guessed it.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />I think everyone is a little too forgiving of Maddie.

Brian won't give her back the specially designed necklace her husband had made for her and she has to have it by the wedding.<br /><br />And then Brian is killed doing a smoke jump.<br /><br />Was it an accident or murder?<br /><br />Did it have anything to do with the necklace<br /><br />Did it have anything to do with a supposed stolen treasure that the bride's late uncle, Roy was supposed to have stolen and who was thought to have committed suicide 30 years ago.<br /><br />And on top of that Cissy Kane - mother of the bride insists Carneige take over as on-site wedding planner.<br /><br />As more murders follow, Carneige begins to wonder if there are going to be enough guests left for the wedding.<br /><br />And then there's that pesky fire.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Great mystery.  Wonderful new characters.  I love the detail about smoke jumpers and the work they do.<br /><br />Aaron Gold - Carnegie's (We're just dating, nothing special as he tells the wedding guests) sort of boyfriend. Determined that he is not going to settle down and wants to keep things casual, but it doesn't stop him from getting into a knock down drag out fight when someone makes a comment about Carnegie.<br /><br />Boris the florist, has to be flown in when the wedding's original florist is hospitalized with a bee sting.

Beau is still upset about the toupee incident, but doesn't mind dumping all the work on Carnegie while getting all the praise.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />The reason this is a 3 star and not higher is the ending.

Her home is being renovated, she's trying to get ready for the big block party, where she was one of the judges to give away a scholarship and her significant other Sol has gone insane.<br /><br />He wants Bel to retire and for the two of them to move to the country, out of her beloved Hoboken.<br /><br />The block party seems to go off ok, except for the small detail of Bel's fellow teacher, Eunice Goodson winding up dead.<br /><br />It get's even stranger when Bel finds out that this conservatively dressed, Anatomy teacher spends her nights as a stripper.<br /><br />Who could have done it?  There certainly was a long enough list, her drug addict sister, her spurned hometown, preacher boyfriend, another teacher who seemed to spend a lot of time at the strip club.  Or maybe it was the scholarship loser or her mother.<br /><br />Or maybe it was just a nut.<br /><br />Bel and her friends, Illuminada Gutrerrez, a private investigator and Betty Ramsey, personal assistant to the President of the college, decide to find out who would kill Eunice and stop them before they can kill again.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />I've been lazy and didn't review all the books between the first book \\"The \\"M\\" Word\\" and this one.  Overall, this series is very good.<br /><br />Bel is great character.  She's very serious about her teaching and can be very funny.  She has new students in each of her books and is either involved in a training class or school activity.  She's the kind of teacher you always hope your children will have.<br /><br />Her e-mails.  Every one of the books contains Bel's e-mails with different groups, How to get through menopause, how to plan her daughters wedding, how to babysit for her new grandbaby.  They are funny, some of the advise will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />Her friends.  Bel has a very nice relationship with her friends and their families.  These people actually investigate the crimes, not just stumble into clues like many heroines do.  It helps that Illuminada is a private detective.<br /><br />Other supporting characters.  This series has a lot of supporting help, from Illuminada's husband and daughter, Betty's new boyfriend, who's the brother of an earlier murder victim. Her son, Bel's children.  They are all woven into the storylines, not big parts but enough to give you the feeling of closeness between friends and family.<br /><br />The mysteries, except for this book.  The mysteries have been good, somewhat complicated and took real investigation on the part of Bel and her friends.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Some of their investigation techniques.  I thought their dressing up like men, one in a wheel chair to go to the strip club was both ridiculous and unnecessary.  They could have gone, disguised as other women with Illuminada's husband as a group.  Women do go to strip clubs with their husbands and boyfriends.<br /><br />Sol, Bel's boyfriend.  I hate to dump on this guy, but he hasn't improved over the series.  He's almost a useless character.  I don't get what Bel sees in him and his constant ranting about her job and her closeness with her pupils can be very irritating.<br /><br />This mystery.  The mystery itself was good, but I thought the solution was a little weak and for the first time, some of their investigating techniques seemed ridiculous.<br /><br />If you're reading this series, be sure and get the Anthology Book - Motherhood is Murder.

A young drug addict is murdered and Abby begins to wonder if the man she's seeking may have been the killer.<br /><br />Threatening phone calls, almost fatal accidents make Abby wonder if a murderer isn't also looking for her.  But is it the man in the SUV or is the husband of Pearl, who made several threatening remarks to Abby after she helped his wife leave him and found her snooping into his financial affairs.<br /><br />With the help of ex-cop, Marco Salvare, Abby has to decide is the killer, the bad driver, an angry husband, or is it something more, a murder which reaches high into the local government and police officials.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Abby is a great character.  She is so determined to find who smashed her car that looking for a murderer just seems a natural extension of that.<br /><br />Marco Salvare, former cop, new bar owner, always seems to be around when Abby needs him.<br /><br />Not a lot of supporting characters yet, but her employee's are interesting and more characters should be added as the series goes along.<br /><br />Good mystery.  Very complicated, but never cheats.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Abby's flower shop.  I can't see how this could possibly make any money when there's a discount flower franchise nearby.<br /><br />A nice start to what could turn out to be a very good series.	2005-02-19

Could it be her husband who has a secret.  One of the people she fired?  One of the property owners who have lost income through the lost leases.  Or someone else?<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Bel's e-mail.  Bel is going through menopause and has an on-line support group.  The helpful suggestions they are offering are both informative and funny.<br /><br />The mystery.  Very good.  I didn't figure it out and it took real detective work on the part of Bel and her new friends to solve it.<br /><br />The supporting characters are good, especially, Illuminade & Betty.  There are also, Becky & Mark.  Bel's two kids.  Becky is going to college in Washington, living with her boyfriend and generally keeps in touch through her e-mail.  Mark is currently a nanny to two small kids.<br /><br />The humor.  There is a lot of humor in this book, I laughed out loud several times.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Sol - Bel's live-in partner.

He's a retired economic professor, who's into preservation and working with Eastern European countries on their economies.

I was too lazy to write individual reviews on each, so this review is of this book and an overall review of the series, which includes:<br /><br />Permed To Death.  Hair Raiser.  Murder By Manicure.  Body Wave.  Highlights To Heaven.  Died Blonde.<br /><br />Died Blonde:<br /><br />Marla Shore, owner of Cut `N\\" Dye Salon isn't happy when going out to check why the electricity in her shop has gone off, stumbles over the body or her rival and former employer, Carolyn Sutton.<br /><br />Who else but Marla, who was angry with Carolyn for moving her new shop into the same mall as she is located and undercutting her prices would want the woman dead.<br /><br />Marla is determined to find that out.  It could be Carolyn's sister, Linda Hall, who was rumored to be jealous of Carolyn, and was angry when she didn't inherit the hair salon.  Or maybe Carolyn's  psychic, Wilda Cleaver, who did inherit the shop, did she kill Carolyn to get it?<br /><br />With the help of her boyfriend, Lt. Dalton Vail, Marla is determined to prove she didn't kill her rival, even though she wanted to many times.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />The relationship between Marla and Dalton Vail and his daughter Brianna.  They met in the first book, \\"Permed To Death\\" where Dalton was investigating Marla as a murder suspect.  Just because she was locked in the shop alone with the victim, made and served her the cup of coffee with the poison and had been being blackmailed by the victim for years, shouldn't have made Marla a suspect should it?<br /><br />This has been a very slow going relationship, Marla has a tragedy in her past that is making it difficult for her to bond with any child.  This tragedy has been well worked into the storyline and Marla's reactions and choices make her a very realistic character.<br /><br />The mysteries.  Except for this book, all the mysteries have been great. In several of the books, both the victims and the murderer have been characters who have appeared in the series since the first book.<br /><br />The supporting characters.  There is a wide range of returning characters from major ones, such as Dalton and Marla's mother, to minor characters, such as Mr. Thomson the landlord and Carolyn herself, who appeared briefly in each book.  Occasionally, a minor character, such as \\"goat\\" the free lance dog groomer will become a major character in a book and then go back to a supporting character.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Not enough use of supporting characters.  Except for her mother, and Dalton, many of the supporting characters are underused.  Marla does everything by herself.  She only rarely will involve anyone with her crime solving, even her best friend Tally is only used as a sounding board.<br /><br />The mystery in this book.  The murderer might as well have had `KILLER' written across their forehead, they were so obvious.

Some of her previous jobs in a dress shop and book store weren't all that great either.<br /><br />After a particularly good day on the phone, Helen is sent to telemarketing heaven.  Instead of selling Tank Titan, she is moving over to other side of the business for the night and doing Survey's.<br /><br />This night looked like it was going to be good.  Taking survey's from rich people about a particular brand of vodka.<br /><br />At least it looked good until she calls Hank Asporth and hears a woman being strangled on the other end of the phone.<br /><br />The police investigate immediately, but find nothing and tell Helen she just heard the television.  Helen's made even more suspicious when Hank's lawyer shows up, he doesn't demand she be fired for the outrageous claims she made, just asks that she doesn't repeat them.<br /><br />It's up to Helen to solve a murder she knows happened without getting too much police attention on herself.<br /><br />Helen hooks up with Savannah Power, the sister of Laredo Manson, who Helen has determined must be the victim.

Francesca Vierling, columnist for the St. Louis City Gazette is on a hot story again.  She's at the Hearts Desire Strip Club, doing \\"A Day In The Life Of A Stripper.\\"<br /><br />Since her idiot boss, Charlie didn't specifically say what kind of stripper she was to follow around, Francesca has chosen Jack Hogenbaum, AKA Leo D. Nardo - Your Titanic Lover.<br /><br />Francesca finds she really likes Jack, who's thirty and only wants to get married and become a house husband, taking care of the home and children for his wife. So she is startled to find out that Jack has disappeared and that she was actually one of the last people to see him alive, talking to an grey haired lady in the parking lot after work.<br /><br />But this story isn't as important as Georgia, her mentor at the paper.  Georgia has been diagnosed with breast cancer and Francesca is taking her to and from her doctor's and chemo appointments.  Georgia doesn't want anyone to know about the cancer, since people tend to steal all your stuff and take over your desk at the paper if they even suspect you're ill.<br /><br />Francesca had settled Georgia into the waiting room at the hospital while she goes to make a call to see if the missing Jack has show up.  She's stunned when she gets back to find the receptionist shot dead at her desk and a therapist and Dr. Brentmoor shot dead in one of the rooms.  Unbelievably, Georgia is still alive, hiding in the waiting room.  She didn't see anything, just heard the shots and never got a good look at the killer.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, more doctors are killed and Francesca starts investigating.  What is common thread between these people.  Her first thoughts, that they were killed because they were rude and obnoxious to the patients was wrong, when Dr. Jolley (who was a nice as his name) turns up dead.<br /><br />Francesca is determined to find out who is killing these people and find out what happened to Jack, who she is also sure is dead.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />The mystery.

Especially since it's only a block from her house.<br /><br />Francesca meets many of the occupants of the neighborhood, Margie, Dina, Patricia and Kathy and her husband Dale.  They're all working at rehabing their homes and their neighborhood and would be happy about it, except for the Caroline.<br /><br />Caroline is the all time champ rehaber, she not only did her own house, but buys other houses and has them rehabed and sold.  She even takes care of the city's property, planting new grass and flowers and taking care of the fountain.  She also tries to take care of everyone else's property.  Telling people what they need to do what they need to plant and when they have to do it, failure may result in city inspectors showing up and fines being levied if you don't comply immediately.<br /><br />Otto Brumbaw isn't going to be pushed around by Caroline.  She insists he repaint his house and he gets a promise from her that she will stop screaming at him and leave him alone if he paints.  She agrees and Otto starts painting.  Caroline, doesn't count on the purple with turquoise trim that he decides on.<br /><br />Caroline fumes when Otto reminds her of their agreement, but his eyesore of a house doesn't stay that way long, as poor Otto manages to electrocute himself on the Christmas Tree lights he still has hanging on his house.  Caroline quickly buys the house and has it repainted to more suitable colors.<br /><br />Francesca is suspicious when Detective Mark Mayhew declares it to be murder.  Someone had deliberately killed Otto.<br /><br />Then a  local drug dealer is burned to death in his house, after arguing with Caroline and destroying some of her newly planted trees, Francesca starts to wonder if Caroline will do anything to keep her neighborhood looking good.  She even had Otto's yappy dog sent to the pound because it was a disgrace to the neighborhood.<br /><br />A gorgeous jogger, who has all the women swooning and  who is legally running across city property is threatened by Caroline if he doesn't stop.  He informs her that he will run where he wants since he isn't doing anything wrong.  His running days are over when he winds up dead in an alley.<br /><br />Francesca is certain Caroline is killing everyone who disturbs the neighborhood.  That brilliant deduction goes out the window when Caroline herself ends up dead with her head bashed in and stabbed with a plastic pink flamingo.<br /><br />Now things are very confusing, who would have killed all those other people and Caroline.  Francesca is determined to figure this out before everyone on the block winds up dead.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Good mystery.  Keeps you guessing until the end.<br /><br />Very funny.  The description of Kathy and Dale's sanding accident had me laughing out loud.  As did Francesca's digging up a garden in search of a body.<br /><br />Francesca has become a more likable character, but needs therapy badly.  Her childhood trauma's have really warped her outlook on life and she'd be a much happier person if she'd get some help to get over it.<br /><br />Lyle Donnegan, Francesca's boyfriend, a college professor is a nice guy.  He wants to marry her, he's agreed to let her keep her apartment if she wants to. (This is her grandparent's apartment and she hasn't changed anything in it since they died over a decade ago). He thinks she is a talented writer and should take that talent somewhere where it is appreciated and not at her paper, where management hates her and constantly wants to get rid of her, despite the fact that she's the most popular writer in the paper.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Francesca's destruction of her relationship.  It's so sad and so unnecessary.<br /><br />The paper.  Once again Charlie and the rest of the staff are almost insufferable.  I hate these people and I don't even find them funny.

She was with her new boyfriend, a biker named Jack.<br /><br />Sydney manages to get everyone ticked off at her when she flirts with the other men and ends with Stephanie, the girlfriend of Crazy Jerry threatening  to beat her up.<br /><br />Leaving the ball, Francesca has the unfortunate luck of stumbling over Sydney's body.  She had been beaten to death with a bike chain.<br /><br />Detective Mark Mayhew suspects everyone at the ball, but Francesca wonders if it might not be someone closer to home.  After all, Sydney was going through a bad divorce.  Could it be her husband who was dumping her for a younger woman.  Or maybe her son, who had a drug habit and was resentful of his mother's attempt to put him in rehab.<br /><br />Then Sydney's new boyfriend, Jack is killed in a motorcycle accident after calling Francesca and saying he would tell her the name of Sydney's killer for $25,000.  If she didn't buy, he knew someone else who would.  Was this someone else the person who killed Sydney and maybe Jack?<br /><br />Once again, Francesca's investigation leads her to a showdown with the killer that almost leaves her dead.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />I enjoyed Francesca much more in this book than I did in the first book, but she is still a somewhat irritating person.  I still think she needs therapy.<br /><br />Her boyfriend Lyle is a nice guy, but Francesca treats him horribly.  Why?  Because this dog has the nerve to want to marry her, take care of her and thinks she could get a better job somewhere else.

Was it an accident?<br /><br />It certainly looks like it, Betsy had just happened to glance up to the 9th floor and saw Belle standing there alone, just before she went over the railing.  Could it be suicide?<br /><br />Jill Cross Larson, Betsy's best friend and police officer from Excelsior, was in Nashville to attend a police seminar, and had got snowbound at Betsy's hotel the night before.  Because even the police can't make it through for hours because of the weather, Jill decides to do as much investigating as she can before they come.<br /><br />What looks like a suicide or accident suddenly starts to look like murder to Jill and Betsy.

Working for the Washington DC based The Eye Street Observer, she would like to do real news, but does her best on the fashion beat until she gets her big break.<br /><br />Lacey, is noticed at the meeting by Hugh Bentley, the famous fashion designer.  He recognizes the vintage suit she's wearing as one of his original 1940's model.  Although he denies every meeting her Aunt, Mimi Smith, who had left Lacey a treasure trove of vintage clothes, Lacey doesn't believe him.<br /><br />She has a note which her Aunt says some unflattering things about Hugh and what went on in the factory during World War II.<br /><br />The fashion beat gets exciting when Esme Fairchild, an intern turns up missing.  She was working for a congressman who was on the committee overseeing the Fashion Museum.  It turns out she was having an affair with the congressman, but she was also trying to get a job with the Bentley's.<br /><br />Lacey found it strange that someone who was involved with the Bentley's disappeared, as her aunt had left notes and other clues to a close friend of hers, Gloria Adams, who had worked for the Bentley's in the 1940's and had mysteriously disappeared.<br /><br />Were these two disappearances, 60 years apart related?  Or did a congressman kill his mistress to avoid scandal.  And what about the armed robbery at a Bentley's store, where the employee's were almost killed?<br /><br />Lacey investigations is getting to close to someone, as a car is blown up in \\"The Eye's\\" parking lot.  Lacey was on the phone with the bomber when the car blew up, they had mistaken another employee's car for hers.<br /><br />Scared, but determined to solve the crime, Lacey gathers the clues which lead not only to the solution of Esme's death, but to a disappearance that had been long forgotten.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />I love Lacey and her vintage clothes.  She's smart, funny and has a great group of friends around her.<br /><br />Her friends: Tony Trujillo - the police reporter on \\"The Eye\\", very funny and doesn't mind if Lacey's story overlap onto his own beat.  He's always there to help.<br /><br />Stella Lake, hairdresser who knows everyone and can get absolutely anything that Lacey needs.<br /><br />Brooke Barton, an attorney friends, who sees conspiracies everywhere and  who meets her match in Damon Newhouse.<br /><br />Damon Newhouse, who runs the web site DEADFED.COM he's a complete conspiracy nut who matches well with Brooke.<br /><br />Miguel Flores: He's the unfortunate clerk at the Bentley's Boutique when it was robbed.  He was nearly killed, but had managed to knock the phone off the desk and call 911.  He's very funny and very angry over the fact that he's fired because Bentley's has a policy to not put up any kind of fight when you're being robbed.  I can't figure out how calling the police when you think the robbers are going to kill you is against the rules.<br /><br />The mystery.  I love mysteries where there is old case that is being solved.  Lacey trying to come up with clue and interviewing 80 year old people to see if they remembered details of what happened while they worked for Bentley's during World War II was very interesting.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />I only have one problem with the series.  That is Vic Donovan, who is Lacey's sort of boyfriend, he's an ex-sheriff from Steamboat Springs, now a security expert that Lacey had been in love with when she lived in Colorado.  He was married and they never dated, he had kissed her once on New Years Eve.  In this story he has gone back to Colorado to sell his house to his ex-wife.  He doesn't write and barely calls Lacey during the months he's there.<br /><br />A guy who can't bother to pick up the phone and call, isn't worth worrying, waiting or caring about.  Not when she has a great guy, Tony Trujillo sitting in her office.  She also goes out with Jeffrey Bently Holmes, nephew of the designer who is also a great guy.<br /><br />I hope Vic either comes up to snuff, or he's dropped as Lacey's boyfriend.  She's to smart to settle for a guy who can't be bothered to keep in contact.<br /><br />That's my rant.<br /><br />Otherwise, great book and looks like it will be a great series.

Or something else that he married after a 4 day courtship in Las Vegas.<br /><br />Everyone is surprised at Martin's sudden marriage, especially his ex-wife Shirley and his mother Babs.  They had both thought Martin might be going to remarry Shirley. They weren't too thrilled to see Brandi wearing a $25,000 fur coat and an even more expensive engagement ring.<br /><br />Things start getting really exciting when a blizzard starts and everyone is stuck at party, and then Hannah stumbles over the body of Brandi, stabbed with an antique cake knife, in the parking lot.<br /><br />Since no one had left, Mike Kingston (one of Hannah's boyfriend) and the detective on the scene, decides that the killer must still be there and for once, he let's Hannah do some investigating on his behalf, as they try to solve the crime before anyone finds out that a murder has been committed.<br /><br />Hannah slowly whittles down the suspects until, the digital photographs Norman has been taking of the food and the guests for Hannah's cookbook, lead to the clue that finally solves the crime.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Hannah's relationship with her two boyfriends, the super sexy cop, Mike Kingston and the not so sexy, but awfully nice dentist Norman Rhodes.

The almost bursting pregnant Andrea, who's married to Bill, the new sheriff and who can't wait to help Hannah and her investigation.

Michelle, the baby sister who is sort of dating police officer Lonnie is always willing to help as much as she can.<br /><br />Their mother Delores, and her new boyfriend, (the suspiciously acting) Winthrop.  I can't figure out if he's really suspicious or if Hannah and her sisters think he's suspicious because they can't imagine anyone wanting to date their mother.<br /><br />Old characters.  The one thing I love about this series is that characters from previous books are always reappearing in the new books.  They may only be there for a paragraph or so but it's nice to see them.  Perfect example is Vera and her Silver Fox.  And the widows of murder victims in two previous books.<br /><br />Hot Brownies.  Hannah's reaction to Mike's constant references to Shawna Lee Quinn's incredible brownies, which are really hot (great).  Hannah decides to give him some real \\"Hot Brownies.\\"<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Old characters.  Although I love the continuity of returning characters, there isn't a lot of explanations, they're just integrated into the storyline and what I loved about Vera and her Silver Fox would mean nothing to someone who hasn't read the previous book.  (But I wouldn't want this to change, I think you should always read series books in sequence).<br /><br />This book is 341 pages long and I thought, wow, this should be great.  Unfortunately, the book ends on page 168.  I don't look at the back of the books before I read them, so the end came so sudden I wasn't expecting it.  169-341 are the recipes.<br /><br />I love the recipes in Joanne Fluke's books, but this is almost a cookbook itself.  I like the way the recipes were always at the end of the chapter that they were mentioned.  In this one they're all together at the back of the book.  At first I thought they weren't including any recipes in the book, because they weren't where they usually were.<br /><br />It's a small personal preference.  I think a lot of people will love the way the recipes are set up and the amount.  Joanne Fluke has enough recipes from all her books, she maybe should think about creating a separate cook book.<br /><br />Great book.  Can't wait for the next one.ll personal preference.

Tonight, however things turned out to be exciting.<br /><br />Jonathan Franke, local environmentalist has discovered that the purple spotted lichen plant is growing around Tinker's Cover.  And by state law, any endangered species must be protected at all costs.<br /><br />So to protect if from the possibilities of fire and trampling, the annual fireworks display has to be cancelled.<br /><br />Despite the protests from the local Veterans group, merchants and the organizers of the annual parade, the board decides they don't want to spend any money on a lawsuit, so the fireworks are cancelled.<br /><br />If that hadn't been exciting enough, Prudence Pratt, announces that she wants something to be done about all the naked people down at Blueberry Pond.  At first everyone just ignores her, after all, who hasn't  stripped down and jumped into the pond on a hot day at least once in their life.<br /><br />But when they find out that Blueberry Pond has been declared one of the best places for naturalist's to visit, everything changes.  After all, no one wants a nudist colony in town.  But they're not sure a law banning it, as Prudence wants is the way to go.<br /><br />Lucy tries to interview Prudence, but the women refuses, after yelling a few things at her.  Prudence, who lives next door to Lucy and her family are not on good terms.  The Stone's family dog, Kudo keeps getting out and killing the Pratt's chickens.  Although Lucy pays her for the chickens, Prudence is taking the Stone family to doggy court to have the problem taken care of.<br /><br />This animosity towards the two family's looks suspicious when later, Lucy stumbles across Prudence's body, run over in her driveway.<br /><br />Who would kill Prudence?  Although no one liked her, did they hate her enough to kill her?  Surely the naturalists wouldn't kill her just because she was trying to get them banned.<br /><br />With the police looking at her, Lucy decides she'd better look into this case before she's arrested for murder.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />What I enjoyed was the government workings of a small town.  The local Board is so worried that they might have to spend some money on a lawsuit that they just cancel the annual fireworks, and then because they're afraid the naturalists might parade in the nude, when they request a parade permit, that they cancel the annual Fourth Of July parade, without any input from the locals.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Mistletoe Murder & Tippy Toe Murder by Leslie Meier were the first two \\"cozy mysteries\\" that I had ever read.  I got hooked on the genre after reading them, I loved Lucy Stone and her family, Bill her husband and her (at that time) three children, Elizabeth, Toby & Sara.  They were a loving and close family and it was funny how Lucy tried to solve her mysteries while dealing with taking care of her family and her part-time jobs.<br /><br />That's why I'm so disappointed in this book, as I was with her last book, \\"Father's Day Murder.\\"  Since Lucy has become a full-time employee of the Pennysaver, the focus of the stories have seemed to change and her home life has been almost completely dropped from the stories.<br /><br />Bill her husband has almost disappeared as a character.  She totally ignores any advice he gives.  In this story, after Elizabeth's battery dies, and she just takes Lucy's car to get to work.  Bill tells Lucy that Elizabeth has to learn to take responsibility and that she is going to have to buy her own battery and will not use Lucy's car.  After all, Lucy was now late to her own job because she has to wait for Bill to drive her.  Lucy just ignores him and buys a new battery and has it put into the car.<br /><br />This isone of several instances in the story where she treats him as if he were just a casual acquaintance.  And she's so worried that her two oldest, Elizabeth & Toby won't like her that she lets them walk all over her.  They do what they want, go where they want and talk back to her about everything.  Lucy has obviously never learned the rule that if your children are living in your house and you're supporting them, that they have to follow your rules, no matter how old they are.<br /><br />To top it off, this is a terrible mystery.  Just as in the last book, Lucy doesn't really solve the crime.  I don't consider it solving the mystery when she finds out who the killer is because the killer is suspicious of her and tries to get rid of her.  Coming face to face with the killer and then having them tell you they did the crime is not solving the crime.  NOTHING, Lucy investigated would have ever led her to the killer.<br /><br />I keep on hoping they will get better.  If you're a new reader, go back and read her early books.

Judith McMonigle Flynn was minding her own business, waiting for guests to show up at her bed and breakfast.<br /><br />Unfortunately, her Cousin Renie shows up with her latest Graphic Arts project, SuperGerm.  Convincing Judith to go with her while she drops it's off, and to have a look at the house on Moonfleet Street.<br /><br />This house has obsessed Renie for fifty years.  In all that time, she had never seen anyone go in or out of the house, no one in the yard, not even kids, although she had seen children's toys in the yard when she was young.  She didn't even know the name of the people who lived in the house.<br /><br />Judith doesn't really care, she has a bigger problem.  Her son Mike and his wife Kristin have separated.  Kristin has gone off to visit her parents, leaving Forest Ranger Mike with the two little boys.<br /><br />But when her husband Joe, ex-cop and current private detective is deep in an investigation of his own and has to go to Omaha on a case, she's at loose ends and decides to help Renie find out whose living in the house.<br /><br />It doesn't take long to find out the house has been inhabited since 1947 by Dick and Jane Bland and Jane's sister Sally.  Dick and Jane even had two kids, Anna, their natural child and Luke, who was adopted. But they can't find anyone, including neighbors who have ever seen any of them.<br /><br />Snooping around the house,  Judith and Renie talk to the milkman Vern Benson, who tells them the Blands get their groceries and mail dropped off regularly and leave the money for him in the milk box.  He's never seen anyone from the house, either.<br /><br />That probably would have been the end of it, however, later that day, when Judith opens the trunk of her car to put in the groceries, she finds the body of the milkman, Vern Benson.<br /><br />Suddenly, Judith is glad Joe is in Omaha.  It doesn't help when the two detectives, Glenn Morris & Jonathan Trashman consider her a suspect in the crime.<br /><br />Deciding she better clear herself, Judith, along with her sidekick Renie starts her own investigation and is stunned to find out the dead man wasn't Vern Benson the milkman, but someone named Frank Purvis, who doesn't seem to have existed before showing up pretending to be the milkman.<br /><br />Why was he at the Bland's house?  And why can't they ever meet Dick & Jane.  They do manage to meet the adult Anna & Luke and even their grandson, a local newscaster but the Blands remain as elusive as ever.<br /><br />Could Frank Purvis's death have anything to do with the large package that had been delivered to the Blands.  When Judith & Renie find out that a package was delivered every year at the same time to the Blands, they become even more suspicious.<br /><br />And why do the police seem so reluctant to investigate the crime?<br /><br />Judith is determined to solve the crime, hopefully before Joe gets back from Omaha.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Joe & Judith's relationship.  I just wish he had been in this story more.<br /><br />Cousin Renie is always a hoot and I love her fights with Phyllis Rackley, Judith's cleaning lady.<br /><br />Gertrude - Judith's mother who has agreed for her daughter's sake to stop calling Joe, Lunkhead.  Afterall, Knucklehead works just as well.<br /><br />Cousin Renie and her husband Bills all out campaign to rid their property of the dreaded squirrel.<br /><br />Sweetum's the cat.  This cat is a true character in the book.  I don't particularly like cats, but I wouldn't mind having this one.<br /><br />Good mystery.  Never guessed what was going on.<br /><br />I think the Mary Daheim Bed & Breakfast series is the best series in the mystery genre.  Not only are they a good mystery, but are very funny.  The relationships between Judith and her huge family of cousins, uncles and aunts are wonderful.  Even though people such as her Uncle Corky and Aunt Theodora usually appear on a page or so in each book, you get a real sense of the closeness of this extended family.<br /><br />If you've reading the series, be sure and get an anthology novel called \\"Motherhood is Murder.\\"  There are 4 stories in the book and one of them is a  Mary Daheim short story, which includes the wedding of Renie's 3 children.  3 weddings on the same day at 3 different locations. Only Carolyn Hart's name shows up when you bring up the book, but don't be fooled.<br /><br />Lowlights: No lowlights, except that it will probably be another a year or so before we get the next one.  If you haven't read them yet, try Mary Daheim's Alpine Series.  I don't think it's as good as her bed & breakfast, but much better than a lot of other series you will read.

Robert McFey had been a prosperous advertising man before he was diagnosed with terminal hepatitis.  Selling his business, he decided he wanted to live out his life doing his art.  That was okay when he was dying, but Robert wasn't going to die.  He'd been misdiagnosed.

Didn't Betsy know that Foster was a murderer?  That five years ago he had killed his lover Angela Schmitt and then a few days later her husband Paul Schmitt.<br /><br />Angela was shot in the locked bookstore where she worked.  Paul was beaten and shot by the same gun in their home.  Foster admitted to having a romance, (they weren't lovers) with Angela but he didn't kill her or Paul.  There wasn't enough evidence and Detective Mike Malloy had to let him go and the murders have remained unsolved.<br /><br />Foster asks Betsy to investigate the crime and clear his name.<br /><br />Betsy found it hard to investigate as everyone seemed to be certain Foster was guilty.  Paul and Angela were such nice people, that there just couldn't have been anyone else who would have wanted to kill them.  Angela was such a sweet, shy person.  And Paul always had a smile on his face, willing to help everyone.<br /><br />Betsy's investigation found that people aren't always what they seem to be and the clues led her to a solution that would surprise everyone.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />The Monday Bunch telling Ghost Stories on Halloween.

(After a long day of work he liked to relax by working on his farm). And was now into antique cars.  His first is a beautiful Stanley Steamer, which needed a little  work.  Betsy hadn't realized that when she agreed to sponsor the car, that the costs to restore would be so expensive.  After all, 100 year old parts were hard to find.<br /><br />But with hard work,  Lars got it going, although he did have a few scalds on his hands and was now missing an eyebrow, his car was a piece of art and Betsy was thrilled with her first ride in it.<br /><br />Volunteering to check in the drivers at a local antique car run, Betsy meets several other owners, including Adam Smith, president of the local club and Charlotte Birmingham, who arrived dressed in an antique dress to go with her and her husband Bill's wonderful Maxwell.  But it was very warm and Charlotte took Betsy up on her offer to ride in her air conditioned car to meet the antique cars when they got to their destination.<br /><br />Charlotte was lucky she accepted the ride, for her husband Bill ends up dead, under his burning car along the way.<br /><br />Why would anyone want to kill Bill Birmingham?  Was it the feud between him and Adam Smith for the Presidency of the club?  What about the problems he had been having with his son Bro, who had left a good job to take over his father's company, but Bill just wouldn't let go of the reigns.  Or was it someone else in the car club who didn't like Bill.  Or maybe Marvin Pierce who was rumored to be in love with the widow.<br /><br />Charlotte asks Betsy to look into the crime and she hesitates until Bro Birmingham shows up and demands that she not look into the crime.<br /><br />Then Detective Morrie Steffans shows up and questions Betsy about what she knew and what she saw.

She's been having nightmares for awhile and wants to get away for a rest.<br /><br />What better way to rest then to go with her friend, deputy Jill Cross to a \\"stitch-in\\" at Naniboujou Lodge.  Or at least it started out peaceful, as Betsy, working on a project in the lounge falls asleep and wakes up to find another woman sitting in the room with her.<br /><br />Sharon Kaye Owen's, a famous needle crafter tells her she's there to try and reconcile with her husband.  They had broken up after Sharon developed allergies which prevented her from participating in almost any thing.<br /><br />Betsy is horrified when she later goes up to her room and finds the body of Sharon Kaye Owen's stretched across her bed.  But it's not as bad, as when she gets Jill and the Lodge owner to go back with her, only to find the body has disappeared.<br /><br />Was Betsy dreaming?  Having another of her nightmares.  Sharon Owens wasn't scheduled to even be at the lodge and she hadn't checked in and no one else had seen her.<br /><br />But Betsy is sure of what she saw and decides to investigate, to prove not only that she had found a body and that Sharon was dead, but to uncover who the killer might be among the other guests.<br /><br />There doesn't seem a shortage of people, including Sharon's family, her ex-husband Frank and their two kids, Liddy & Doogie.

Betsy volunteers to donate all the supplies necessary to repair the tapestry and while looking it over, (Worrying because she hadn't anticipated there would be so much work, or that it was so big), she notices little icons sewn onto the tapestry.  Betsy wonders if they have some meaning and copies several of them down and borrows a book of Icons for John Rettger to try and decipher them.<br /><br />Deciphering icons doesn't seem as important when Betsy has an accident while driving in a blizzard and having to spend the night in a freezing car, where she learns the important lesson of why people in Minnesota always have a survival kit in their car.  When it's discovered that the brake line was cut, Betsy starts to worry, and then when she suffers arsenic poisoning and her building catches on fire, she begins to wonder if someone is trying to kill her.<br /><br />There's no lack of suspects.  Maybe Joe Mickels has decided to get her out of the building once and for all.  Then there's Hal \\"The Pig\\" Norman, Betsy's ex-husband, whose last coed girlfriend turned him into the college and he's now jobless and homeless and swears undying love for Betsy and  really, really wants to get back together with her.  Does the fact that she is about to inherit millions have anything to do with it, and what about the will she had written shortly after their marriage where she left everything to him.  Was that still valid.<br /><br />Or did it have something to do with the tapestry?  Especially when all Betsy's notes and then the tapestry itself disappears.  Would she be able to solve this mystery before she finally ends up dead?<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />The supporting characters are wonderful Jill Cross & Mike Malloy, who are police officers.  The Monday Bunch - a group of needle crafters,  who get together on Monday's in Crewel World to do needlework.

Martha, who is a regular at the Monday needlework group that meets at Crewel World every week, just doesn't seem the type who would have killed anyone.  And if Martha had killed Trudie, why did Carl disappear?<br /><br />With all these questions, Betsy hopes she can solve the crime before poor Martha ends up permanently behind bars.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Goodwin, who is a part-time employee at Crewel World and knows absolutely everything about needle work.

Her shop was doing well and her older sister Betsy Devonshire was coming to stay with her.<br /><br />Betsy wasn't having such a good day, driving cross country from California where she had just gone through a divorce from her cheating college professor husband, she was broke and at fifty-five, wasn't too thrilled about having to start over once again.<br /><br />After arriving, Betsy wasn't sure how long she was going to stay.  Was there room?  She knew Margot had sold her house after her husband's death, but the small apartment over the shop didn't seem big enough for the two of them.<br /><br />That problem was soon solved, when one night, Betsy finds the door of the shop open and going in, finds Margot, dead on the floor.<br /><br />Who would kill Margot, who seemed to be loved by almost everyone in town.<br /><br />Maybe Joe Mickels, who owns the building Crewel World is located and has been trying to get Margot out for months.  Irene Potter, who was jealous of Margot, she wanted to open her own needlecraft shop and was now hoping to take over Crewel World.<br /><br />Betsy is forced to investigate the crime, when Police Officer Mike Malloy decides it was a robbery gone bad.  Would she be able to solve the crime before she ends up as a second victim.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Betsy is a great character.  Margot is also a great character and it's surprising that she turns out to be the victim, you almost think she is going to be the main character.<br /><br />The secondary characters are also very interesting, especially, Jill Cross, the lone female Police Officer and Goodwin - part-time employee of Crewel World.  He knows everything about needlework and is also very funny.  Irene Potter is a nut, but very entertaining.<br /><br />I love the needlework information.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Only problem is the mystery.  I figured out who and why very early.

Now they're dancing, (Sam doesn't actually dance, he plants himself in the middle of the floor and sways with the music).<br /><br /> Jennifer isn't sure but she thinks he may be going to pop the question and she isn't ready for it. So she starts asking him questions about the death of Suzanne Gray. (Nothing kills an evening of romance like discussing a suicide).<br /><br /> Suzanne had been discovered, dressed in a long white dress, satin shoes, a blue ribbon in her hair, lace gloves on her hands and a bouquet of flowers, stretched out over the grave of her newly buried fiancee, Richard Hovey.<br /><br /> Richard had been one of the most powerful attorney's in Atlanta, famous for getting killers out of prison. But one night, while preparing for his lover to arrive, with a bathtub full of warm scented water. Candles every where. Richard had slipped on the rose petals that had been scatter around and fell down the stairs, breaking his neck.<br /><br /> Jennifer thought it was strange for anyone to kill themselves by taking an overdose of pills and then laying down to freeze to death on a grave. Even more strange was the Hovey family denied Suzanne was his fiancee. They claimed to have never heard of her and Richards ex-wife claimed they were seeing each other and had planned on remarrying.<br /><br /> Investigating Suzanne's death is put on hold for the moment, when Jennifer is stunned the next morning by seeing the newspaper announcement of the engagement of Isabelle Renard and Sam Culpepper.<br /><br /> Was that what Sam wanted to talk to her about the night before?<br /><br />Jennifer doesn't let that stop her investigation.  Was Suzanne a suicide or murdered?  Was Richard's fall an accident or murder?  Were they engaged?  Was he going to marry his ex-wife or was there someone else?  Did the wife killer that Richard had just got out of prison have anything to do with it?  Isabelle claims he was out to get her and was looking for Sam to protect her.<br /><br />All very confusing, but Jennifer was determined to figure it all out and to get Sam back without resorting to homicide herself.<br /><br /> Highlights<br /><br /> Jennifer and her writer's group investigating if Suzanne had actually made any wedding plans. April going to the bakery with her two kids and sampling everything in sight. Leigh Ann's outrageous story to a saleswoman in the Bridal boutique to get her to let them see the dress Suzanne had ordered.<br /><br /> The return of Emma Walker and her mutant dog.<br /><br /> Teague McAfee, reporter for the Atlanta Eye. He usually only has a few pages in each book and is a very sleazy character, but is so funny you overlook that.<br /><br /> The mystery. This is almost the only book in the series where I didn't figure out the mystery or the killer. And I like the fact that in all the books, the crime happens quickly, usually in the first chapter. In ths book, Suzanne is dead in the first paragraph.<br /><br /> Lowlights:<br /><br /> Sam Culpepper. Sam is usually the calming, sane, rational person in the group. In this book, he was an idiot. I thought he was acting out of character.<br /><br /> Not enough of the current books the writer's group are working on. You usually get a reading of one of the horrendous books, which are always very funny.<br /><br /> This series has really improved with each succeeding book. Jennifer acted so stupid in the first book, I almost didn't go onto the second one, but the funny writing caught me and I've thoroughly enjoyed this series.<br /><br /> If you like this review, I have listed my previous ones in the About Me Section.

It sounds strange to Jennifer, but not as strange as when Mrs. Ashton tells her that the reason she wants this done, is because someone is trying to kill her. She wants Jennifer to promise that when she is murdered that the killer won't get away with it.<br /><br />Jennifer thinks she might be nuts, even though she had passed a competancy hearing several months before which had been brought by her sister-in-law Eileen, who is the person Mary thinks is trying to kill her.<br /><br />It also doesn't help when Jennifer's friend Leigh Ann tells her all about the houses haunted past.<br />Jennifer doesn't have to worry long about any of this, because on the first night she's staying at the house, Jennifer wakes up to Mrs. Ashton screams. After breaking out of her room (which was mysteriously blocked), she finds Mrs. Ashton's bedroom dripping in blood and the elderly lady missing.<br /><br />Is she dead? Was she murdered? And who would want to kill her?<br /><br />There are certainly enough suspicious characters. Her housekeeper Melba, her cook, Arthur. Her sister-in-law Eileen?

Leigh Ann's funny telling of the haunting of the Ashton mansion, which she seems to believe. Teri's description of her new romance mystery novel, which involves a female dog sledder in the wilds of Alaska. And April, who unbelievably has gotten a contract for her children's novel (The Case Of The Missing Nuts), about Billy and his sidekick Barney the flying squirrel. I think the story would have been better with her original idea, where Barney was his friendly bat.<br /><br />Jennifer and her writer's group on a late night search for a secret passageway in the Ashton mansion. They had a previous middle of the night search in the last book, (Dying To Remember) that was also very funny.<br /><br />Sam, Jennifer's reporter almost permanant boyfriend, who is a calming influence over everyone.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />Once again the mystery was too easy to solve.

Having to call your father to come pick you up at the prom was bad enough, but coming home to find her house toilet papered by Sheena Cassidy (David's ex-girlfriend) who was a wee bit jealous.<br /><br />But, her friend from her writers group, Leigh Ann was going and Jennifer promised to go with her.

It's even more unfortunate when on a secret meeting at the East Lake Fertility Clinic, two guys show up shooting.<br />When it's all over and Jennifer can climb out of the dumpster she's been hiding in, Johnny Z (who acts like an escapee from a 1940's Film Noir) has been shot and the woman they were meeting, Beverly Hoffman is dead.<br />Why would anyone murder Beverly, who worked at the clinic?  And what was she going to give to Johnny Z for his client, seventeen year old, Diane Robbins, who was adopted at 3 and wants to find her birth parents?<br />Jennifer is confused as to what a fertility clinic would have to do with an adoption.

Emmie went out that night and hasn't come back, and it's 3:00 am.<br />From that phone call Jennifer finds herself smack in the middle of another mystery.  She finds Emmie, but unfortunately, the lady is holding a knife, by the pool, where her ex-husband, Edgar Walker, owner of Edgar's Down Home Grill, is floating, dead in the water.<br />Who would want Edgar Walker dead?  Was Emmie still angry over Edgar divorcing her for a younger woman a decade before?  She insists she dumped Edgar.<br />What about Lisa his wife and manager of The Down Home Grill's?<br />Maybe a disgruntled employee.<br />Did it have anything to do with the new franchise agreements he was trying to set up?  And what happened to Natalie Brewster, the woman who was working with Edgar on the franchises?  She seems to have disappeared into thin air.<br />And could Edgar have been killed over his special sauce, the recipe which only he knew and was the reason for the popularity of his restaurants and why they were going to be franchised.<br /><br />It's up to Jennifer, with help from her sometimes boyfriend, reporter Sam Culpepper to solve this mystery before Emmie Walker spends her golden years in prison.<br />Highlights:<br />Jennifer's writers group.

(She's a vegetarian).<br />Lowlights:<br />I find some of the things Jennifer does, totally stupid.  Although she doesn't do anything as dumb as she did in the last book, I don't think she actually solved this mystery.  Only finding out who the killer is when they try to kill you isn't exactly solving the crime.<br />Jennifer's writing.  Several sections of Jennifer's new book are highlighted throughout the story and they are awful. I'd demand my money back if I got a book this bad.  They're humorous to read because they're so bad, but I think we're supposed to take Jennifer as a serious and good writer.<br />Overall not a great book but ok as a series to read while waiting for new books from your favorite authors.lights:<br />I find some of the things Jennifer does, totally stupid.

Especially with agent Penney Richmond who after receiving Jennifer's latest, took a year to reject it.<br />Jennifer decides she will plan the perfect murder, which should help her writing.  And Penney's going to be the victim.<br />When Penney winds up dead, Jennifer wonders if she maybe carried things a little too far.<br />Highlights:<br />Jennifer's relationship with Sam Culpepper, a reporter. She can't decide if she does or doesn't want a relationship with him.<br />Her writer's group.  This group of women write a variety of different genre's and are very funny.<br />It's an interesting premise.  Trying to see if you were a murderer, could you get into a secure apartment building, could you pick a lock, etc.<br />Jennifer's conversations with Jaime, her not yet conceived but hoped for future baby.<br />Lowlights:<br />Jennifer is kind of stupid.  Three stupid things she does:<br />1.  Writes threatening letters to Penney - background for the book.<br />2.  Takes a real gun with her when she goes to Penney's apartment, the night she's going through the make-believe murder.  Penney is, of course, murdered that night.<br />3.  Giving anyone sleeping pills in wine to knock them out, to give you an alibi.<br />She's lucky she didn't go to jail.<br />Jolene Arizona, the lead character in her new book.  She's a left-handed, blind-in-one-eye, bareback-riding circus performer turned Hollywood detective and who sleeps with EVERY client.<br />And Jennifer wonders why she's not published.<br />Not a great start, but an easy, quick read, and good enough to go onto the second book, Dying to Get Even.	2004-06-24

Gary, who she had been dating and then dumped.  Irene - an older woman that Steffi was trying to get fired, because she thought Irene was too old to work there.<br /><br />The other memebers of Jimi's group:<br /><br />Delia Grant , travel agent who went to high school with Jimi and thinks she's living in \\"South Pacific\\", only wearing mumu's and sarongs with a big flower in her hair. It probably wouldn't be so bad, if she didn't always wear some type of shirt under her sarong.<br /><br />Delia's friend Barbara Merchant, a very shy unattractive woman who is also a travel agent.  Neither liked Steffi.<br /><br />Bert Chumley - an elderly man who claimed to have had a date with Steffi.<br /><br />Carl Cutler - restaurant owner, who told Jimi that he knew Steffi in high school and she had been the only person who had been nice to him.  He had been thrilled to find her working at the center and was upset over her death.<br /><br />Or maybe:<br /><br />Dr. Ben. Barrows - dermatologist, who had signed up at the center, but quit when Steffi tried to get him to donate his services to the Center.  He didn't believe dermatologist's should do plastic surgery without being properly trained, but Steffi wouldn't quit asking him to do it for their clients.<br /><br />Is it one of them, or someone else?  Did it have to do with Steffi's nasty tongue and bad attitude towards everyone, or did it have something to do with the business.  She was heard to argue with the owner Steve, insisting he owed her something.<br /><br />Was she blackmailing someone?  What was in the notebook that she had before she died and which Steve is desperate to find.<br /><br />Then there's another murder.  That cuts down on the suspects, but when there is a third murder, Jimi really begins to worry that every one might be in danger and she has to find the killer before there's no one left for her to date at the center.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Lucy - Jimi's dog has fallen in love with Barney the doberman down the street.  Jimi spends half her time chasing down the dog, who digs under the fence, ruining the flowers and digging up the bricks on the sidewalk outside Barney's owner, the aforemention, Dr. Ben Barrow's house.<br /><br />Dr. Ben isn't too pleased to with either Lucy or Jimi.  But that couldn't be the reason Jimi's car is blown up, could it?<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Jimi is a very funny character.  You really like her and her family, Her two daughters, Chloe & Shannon, her grandmother and her cousin, Det. Danny.<br /><br />Grandma setting Jimi up on a blind date with the butcher's son.  It might help them get cheaper meat.  And then trying to set Danny up with Delia Grant.<br /><br />Good mystery.  In both this book and her previoius book - \\"Divorce Can Be Murder.\\" the mystery starts right away.  Steffi's dead by page 10.  I didn't guess the killer or why they were killing.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of mysteries you get to know the additional characters, they're not just names you're trying to remember every time they show up.<br /><br />Just a very nice read.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br /><br />This book was published in 1999 and it looks like it's the last of the series.  The author Victoria Pade is a very popular & prolific writer in the Harlequin Romances.  I went to Harlequin on-line, because they have author biography's and in Victoria Pade's it shows she wrote 2 mystery's.  So it looks like \\"Divorce Can Be Murder.\\" and \\"Dating Can Be Deadly.\\" may be all we're going to get.<br /><br />This is really too bad, because both of these books are wonderful and I will be very sorry if there aren't any more, but 5 years is a long time between books.<br /><br />Even with only two books it's better to read this small series than slog through 7 or 8 books in a lesser series.<br /><br />VICTORIA PADE PLEASE WRITE ANOTHER ONE.ery popular & prolific writer in the Harlequin Romances.

And the late Mrs. Koester's fudge cupcakes are proving a problem.<br />Beatrice Koester's very anxious to have the cupcake in the cookbook, for her husband Ted's sake.  He &amp; mom were very close.  Unfortunately, the recipe includes 1/2 cup of secret ingredient.  It's up to Hannah and her partner Lisa to try and find out what that ingredient is.<br />So it trial and error as they bake and bake.  Hannah's first batch is taking to the Potluck Cooking class that she's teaching at the local community college.  (They're testing all the recipes.)<br />Sheriff Grant is at the college, and Hannah gives him a couple of cupcakes to try out.  Unfortunately, he wasn't able to give a review as when she's putting out the trash, Hannah finds the Sheriff's body in the dumpster.<br />Who'd want the sheriff dead?  Did it have anything to do with the election?  What about his son's death in a car accident a couple years ago?  Or maybe it was the &quot;big case&quot; he always found and solved just before elections.<br />Things get even worse, when Bill is taken off duty by acting Sheriff Mike Kingston,(Hannah's Boyfriend), as a possible suspect.<br />Hannah and Andrea have to work hard to find who the killer is, before Bill gets arrested.<br />Highlights:<br />Hannah's relationship with her two boyfriends, Mike the Cop and Norman the Dentist.

There are a lot of returning characters in each book, you really get to know them well.<br />Murder Victim - Another unusual thing to this series, is that the murder victim is often someone who has appeared in previous books.  Sheriff Grant has been in the books from the first, so it was surprising to have him killed off.<br />Hannah's cat Moishe.  He almost makes me a cat lover.<br />Great Recipe's.<br />Lowlights:<br />Guessing the killer was too easy.  I knew who did it very early, but not why, so it was still an enjoyable mystery.<br />Hannah acting totally stupid at the end of the book.  There was no reason for any of it to happen if she had done things a little smarter.<br />This is a great series.  I've already pre-ordered the next one, The Sugar Cookie Murder.<br />If you're looking for another good series to read while you're waiting, I found a one by Victoria Pade, there's only two books, Divorce Can Be Murder &amp; Dating Can Be Deadly, but they're both very funny along with a good mystery.this series, is that the murder victim is often someone who has appeared in previous books.

And then everyone else, except Private Largesse died in battles over the next two days.

And they're determined to put on a play.<br />Emma Lord, owner and editor of the Alpine Advocate is going crazy as she sits in theatre, covering the rehearsal of the play, written by Destiny Parson's called the Outcast.  Taking place in a diner and based on the Wizard of Oz it ends with a heartwarming, \\"Can't we all get along\\" speech. She just hopes it will be better on opening night than it was on rehearsal day.<br />It may not have been better, but it was more exciting.  At the climax of the play, when Nat Cardenas (college president) playing the sheriff shoots the diner's cook Hans Berenger (dean of students at the college).  Unfortunately, Hans doesn't get up for his curtain call.<br />Who would want to kill Hans?  Just because no one liked him, didn't mean they would want him dead.<br />Emma starts investigating on her own.  Was it Destiny? Emma may secretly hope it is, because ever since Destiny bought the house across the street from Emma, she makes a point of sending her dog across the street to do its duty on Emma's front lawn. Emma isn't even too upset when the dog ends up dead.  Could it be the same killer?<br />What about Jim Medved the local veternarian?  It was said that he and Hans got into a fight when Hans kicked his dog Dodo, (playing Toto).  Or Rip Ridley - high school coach, who was turned down for a coaching job at college because Hans didn't think their college should be involved in anything but intramural sports. Or Rita Patricelli, who he had been dating.<br />Or maybe the bushy haired stranger that Roger Hibbert - Vida's grandson claims to have seen backstage.<br />With so many suspects, Emma has to work hard to not only to get Milo going, but to stay a jump ahead of that news scooper, Spencer Fleetwood and his radio station.<br />Highlights:<br />The obnoxious Roger - This kid has been in the series since he was about 8 and is a holy terror.  He's now 16 and nearly shocks Vida into heart failure when he comes out in the play and his first line includes about three *F* words.<br />Ed Bronsky - who's also in the play, but spends the entire play, sitting at the counter eating.  He misses the entire shooting, except he almost gets the second shot, which lodged in the counter a couple inches from his backside. (Emma and Milo don't know how it could have missed such a huge target).<br />Vida and Thyra Rasmussen getting into a shouting match in the Alpine office.  (These two have a long time hatred, going back to Vida's mother and some squash). (see Alpine Kindred).<br />Carla Steinmetz Telliaferro's, demon child.<br />Lowlights:<br />Sympathy sex.

One is that she hasn't been feeling too well lately and the other is she's about to turn the big 60.<br />But both of these seem unimportant when while cleaning the old Devilier House, which has been converted to apartments, her cleaning crew stumbles across a body.<br />Being braver than her crew, Charlotte goes to the closet to check and realizes that the half-dressed man sitting on the floor is indeed dead.  And even though he's wearing a purple Mardi Gras mask, there's something familiar about him.<br />But even she was shocked to hear that the dead man was Drew Bergeron, who supposedly died in a plane crash years before.  Where had he been, and why had he come back.<br />Charlotte couldn't help wondering if his death had anything to do with the &quot;accidental&quot; death of Bill Hebert, husband of Marion Hebert, one of her clients.  Bill had been fired by Drew years before and had fell into a depression over it.  Marion still blames that firing for Bill not paying as close attention as he should have to his new job and that was what caused the accident.<br />Or maybe it was the secret that Marion, Bill and Drew shared, going back 20 years which was the real problem.<br />Charlotte tries to solve the mystery, before the killer can kill again.<br />Highlights:<br />I really like the relationship between Charlotte and her family friends, especially her niece, Judith who's a Police Detective and her son, Hank, who's a doctor.<br />She has a great just beginning, but not quite a  romance, yet starting with Detective Louis Thibodeaux, who is getting ready to retire and is living in the other half of Charlotte's Duplex while he's building his new house.  If you read the first book in this series, &quot;Maid For Murder&quot; these two would have been the least likely people to have ever gotten together.<br />Lowlights:<br />The mystery.  I figured out who did it and why halfway through the book and then spent the rest of the book, thinking, it must be a red herring because it can't be that easy.  But it was.<br />Too many loose ends.  Why did Drew leave.  You have theories, but no one ever comes right out says this is why Drew disappeared.  How did he do it, and why did he come back?<br />There are several things the killer does that don't make sense and they're not explained, I can't say what they are because it would give away who the killer was.<br />Overall it was an nice read.  Nothing that makes you really excited to get the next book in the series. But good enough that you want to read the next one.book and then spent the rest of the book, thinking, it must be a red herring because it can't be that easy.  But it was.<br />Too many loose ends.

She and Tom had an affair which produced her son Adam and she then waited almost 30 years for him to marry her. Now she feels as if her life is over and nothing interests her.<br />Her priest brother, Ben whose parish is in Tuba City, Arizona, invites her to go to Italy with him where he has a conference, but she doesn't really want to go anywhere.<br />And she's worried about her son, Adam, who's a newly ordained priest and his parish is in Northern Alaska, where he has to worry about dying of cold or polar bears.<br />Judge Marsha Foster-Klein, who was the judge at the trial of Tom's killer, asks a favor of Emma, she's got a threatening letter and would like Emma to investigate it.<br />At first Emma doesn't want to do it, but Vida finally convinces her to do it.  The letter claims the Judge will never get her appointment because of things that had happened in the past, and included was an old photograph showing a railroad trestle with a rope hanging from it.  The photo is probably 90 years old and none of them know what it means.<br />Then at the funeral of Jack Froland, Miles Dodge, the sheriff drives up and stops the burial.  There are suspicions that Jack, a man in his 80's who was dying of cancer, may have been murdered.<br />And if that wasn't enought, a forest fire starts and after it's over, a dead body is found.<br />How these three storylines are intertwined, along with a fourth storyline, which takes place in 1916-1917, showing ancestors of many of the people involved in the modern story and explains what the photograph means, is a fascinating mystery which Emma finds difficult to solve.<br />Highligts:<br />Jack Froland funeral announcement which says &quot;Come See Jack In The Box.&quot;<br />Milo asking Emma after a home cooked meal if it would help her if they went to bed together?<br />The fact that Milo is so obviously in love with her and seems to be taking her role in the unrequited love department.<br />The character's in this series are so real, that you just ache for them.<br />Spencer Fleetwood - owner of the new radio station in town, who keeps scooping Emma on all the stories.<br />Lowlights:<br />Tom Cavanaugh - I never liked this character.

Sheriff Milo Dodge is in love.<br />Emma Lord, owner and editor of the Alpine Advocate is happy for him, really she is.  Even though Jeannie Clay is young enough to be his daughter.<br />Emma is also in love, although Emma is a little reluctant to lose her independence, so much so, that she wouldn't let Tom buy her a new car when her old jaguar was trashed.  Instead she's paying him $50.00 a month for the Lexus until it's paid off or they get married.  Since this affair has been going on for almost 30 years, she'll probably pay the car off.<br />She has unwed mother, Amber Ramsey &amp; baby Danny living with her.  Amber is an unbelievable slob.  And she's inherited two cats, Rheims &amp; Rouen.<br />In the middle of all this, Emma gets a phone call from a long unheard from cousin Ronnie Mallet, who's in jail for murdering his girlfriend Carol Stokes.  Carol had grown up in Alpine, and he had heard through her that Emma was some kind of investigator and could she help him.<br />At first Emma doesn't want to do anything.  It's Easter and her brother Ben, who's a priest in Tuba City, Arizona and her son, Adam, who's a seminary student in St. Paul are coming for a visit.  But plans are upset and Emma finds she's going to be alone over the Easter weekend, so her sidekick and employee from the paper, Vida Runkel talks her into checking out Ronnie's story.  Vida thinks family is the most important thing in the world, even if you don't know them.<br />Ronnie turns out to be somewhat of a dunderhead, he's more worried about the whereabouts of his dog than the fact that he's in jail for murder.<br />Checking out the victim, Emma finds that Carol Stokes is the kind of person who probably had a lot of people who wanted to kill her.<br />She had a tendancy to beat up her boyfriends, including Ronnie.<br />She stole Ronnie from her next door neighbor Maybeth.<br />She had recently been reunited with the daughter she had put up for adoption.  Kendra Addison, seemed pleased to meet her birth mother, but her parents weren't as thrilled.<br />Neither the police or Ronnie's attorney will listen to Emma as she tries to tell them about the alabi she found for Ronnie.<br />Then another neighbor of Carol's, 60ish year old nurse, Henrietta Altdorf is killed.<br />Emma and Vida gather all the clues which go back almost 20 years to solve this puzzling mystery.<br />Highlights:<br />The Harquist and O'Neill's feud, which started years ago when the family's pet goat was run over, flattening everything but the hat it was wearing.  The Harquist's kidnap 15 year old Meara O'Neill and are hold up in their home.  During the standoff with the sheriff's department, Meara sets the house on fire and when the Harquist boys (they're in their forties) are running out, one of them trips on the front steps and shoots Milo in the foot.<br />Ed Bronsky's autobiography Mr. Ed is being turned into an animated series, of course all the people are now going to be animals and Ed &amp; his family will be Pigs.<br />No lowlights in this book.

After promising Carla will set up another appointment, Emma breaths a sigh of relief over another crisis solved.<br />Not exactly, when Carla goes to the college to take the picture, she stumbles across Einar, dead on the floor in the college kitchen.<br />Milo Dodge, the town sheriff, and Emma's former lover doesn't waste time and arrests Ron Bjornson's who works as a night security guard on campus.  Rumors say that Einar was having an affair with Ron's wife, Maylene, the librarian.<br />Emma is convinced Milo has the wrong person.  There are too many other suspects, including Einar's family.  His mean mother, Thyra, His brother Harold.  And why won't his wife Marlys see anyone. And why hasn't anyone seen his son Beau?<br />On top of everything, Milo refuses to speak to Emma.  He tells her he doesn't want to become friends again, he'd rather stay mad.<br />So she can't get any information on the box of gold nuggets that was discovered in a burned out warehouse the previous year. (This happened while Emma and Vida were in Cannon Beach - Alpine Journey) Carla's story about it reads like her usual stories, no information included.  Nor can she find out about the skeleton that was uncovered while escavation of the burned out warehouse was being done.<br />At first it seemed it might be the owner of the gold nuggets who might have been killed 100 years ago, but the coroner says it's only been there about 8 months, since the time of the fire.<br />This time Emma and Vida's snooping turns serious, as Vida gets shot and then nearly strangled and Emma winds up face to face with the killer.<br />Highlights:<br />Carla, is pregnant and going to marry the Dean of the community college Ryan Talliaferro.  She's also going to quit the Advocate and start a new job as Advisor to the student newspaper at the college.  (And people wonder what's wrong with todays reporters).<br />Ed Bronsky hiring an au pair girl from Sweden.<br />Ginny Burmeister Erlandson's year old son Brad whom she is allowed to bring into the office while working.  Ok when he was confined to his carrycot, but not he's moving.<br />Milo telling Emma he didn't want to be friends and that she was crazy if she thought Tom Cavanaugh was going to ride into town on a white charger and carry her off.<br />Lowlights:<br />Tom Cavauaugh, (There is a major storline here, otherwise I had promised not to mention this guy in my reviews anymore.) Father of Emma's son Adam.  Tom married Sandra for her money, had an affair with the twenty-two year old Emma, who worked for him.  Promised marriage and undying love, but managed to get both Emma and his wife pregnant at the same time.  Did nothing to help Emma raise Adam. (She said she would do it herself, but that shouldn't have stopped him from insisting on knowing his son and helping to support him.) Twenty years later he decided to meet Adam.  Then he gets together with Emma during a conference. Says he's leaving Sandra, asks her to marry him and then dumps her again.  It's over a year since they've spoken and now Emma finds out through Leo, her ad manger, that Sandra had died several months before.  And Tom never called her.<br />Emma broke up with Milo because she couldn't get past her relationship with this jerk.  What makes me so angry about this storyline is that when this series started, Emma was thinking about finding someone to be with, maybe having another child.  But she has wasted her entire adult life waiting for this creep.  And the fact that her family and friends think he's so wonderful only makes it more irritating.  I think eventually, the author is going to hook Emma up with him.  The fact that she should be with Milo, where she always noted she felt safe and secure, just doesn't appear to be in the cards.<br />But this mystery was better than the last few and I really enjoyed it.

There's a fight going on in the Parish Council and on the St. Mildred's school board. The traditional memebers are worried that the non-catholic members are trying to change the school into a private school.<br />Father Kelly, the African American priest is finding it difficult to settle the problems between them, formerly a teacher at the seminary, this is his first church and it's hard to be authorative when your members are thinking about complaining to the Church Council and having you removed.<br />Deciding to expand the Parish council membership, an election is underway.  Into this mess comes, Ursual O'Toole Randall, who has returned to Alpine with her fiancee, Warren Wells.  Ursula, who is now a wealthy woman decides to run for the council and manages to tick off many members of the group with her superior attitude.<br />When Ursula winds up dead, drowned in the river, there is no lack of suspects.<br />Emma Lord, owner and editor of the Alpine Advocate hates to think that a member of her church would do away with Ursula, but there were a lot of suspects.<br />Such as: Francine Wells, owner of the Fine Apparal Shop, who is Warren's ex-wife, and a member of the Parish Council.  She's still bitter about the divorce and hates Ursula, as does her daughter who has just returned to town for a visit.<br />Ursula's two brother's Jake &amp; Buzzy.  Jake is doing ok with his store, but Buzzy has been unemployed for years since the timber industry has shut down and he and his wife have recently separated.<br />Ski shop owner, Verb Vancich, who hated Warren Wells and was worried when Warren announced he was opening another ski shop in town.

Deciding what it needs is a short, snappy, rememberable name, Ed has chosen the classic title of &quot;Mr. Ed.&quot;<br />Plus Polly Patricelli see's a holy vision in a cracked vase which brings hundreds of visitors to see it.<br />Highlights:<br />Emma and the Sheriff Milo Dodge have finally gotten together.<br />Ed Bronsky has turned into a hilarious character.  With his new million, he attempts to throw his weight around and get involved with everything, although now that he's in charge of St. Mildred's food bank, there is suspicion about the amount of day old pastries from the Upper Crust Bakery that seems to disappear when he's on duty.<br />Adam, Emma's formerly turnip brained son has finally decided on a career.  You've had a hint for the last couple of books, so it wasn't as much of a surprise to me as it was a shock to Emma.<br />Lowlights:<br />Unbelievably, it's also the fact that Emma and Milo have finally gotten together.  For some reason, now that these two are together, the author writes them as if she doesn't want them together.  I was depressed throughout the story that these two are not going to be kept together.  And it's equally frustrating that Emma's close friend Vida Runkel doesn't think they belong together and that Emma should get back together with the married jerk who fathered Adam. (I promised in an earlier review not to discuss this person again. See previous reviews for my look at this relationship).<br />There are several storylines which go no where in this book.  Why did the lawyer call Father Kelly right after she talked to Emma?  Everything just ends with the discovery of the killer.<br />I figured out who the killer was early in the book, but the ending was badly written, that I had to read it twice as I thought someone else was the killer when it was all over.<br />Emma's employee's are barely in the story.  Leo Walsh is only mentioned a couple of times.  I also get a feeling now that he's next in line to be Emma's boyfriend.  I hope I'm wrong about this.  Carla appears only to take some pictures, Ginny only as a sideline character.<br />Vida Runkel is beginning to be a pain.  She is so convinced Emma should go back to Tommy Boy, who is still married and won't leave his wife. She has become terribly bossy.  Emma needs to remember Vida is an employee, not the owner of the Advocate.<br />Every series has one or two bad books, and this is definitely the one for this series. (I hope there aren't any more).

Gordon's disappearance after the funeral only leads to more speculation, was he angry over her divorcing him, or the fact that she was allegedly having affairs with the college student who took summer jobs in town.

Despite the fact that nobody wants her help and these relatives by marriage don't like her and make it very plain that they don't like or want her around.<br />Vida is totally obnoxious, rude and heartless in this book.

The previous book where she solved a crime away was &quot;Alpine Escape&quot;, which involved Mavis's pregnant daughter &amp; son-in-law.  In that case, it was interesting, because she was solving a 100 year old murder, how she found clues and solved the crime was interesting.  This time, with real living people involved, and very unintersting, obnoxious people at that, I didn't care.  I didn't care who killed Audrey, or why.  The only person you felt sorry for in this entire story turned out to be the killer.  (Knowing that shouldn't spoil the storyline as you don't feel sorry for them until you find out they are the killer.)<br />I really disliked this book, but couldn't give it 1 star because as much as I disliked it, it is still better than many other books of this type, just not up to the authors usual standards.t any of these relatives, they didn't even exchange Christmas cards, yet she get so involved that she refuses to leave until the crime is solved.

Emma Lord, owner and editor of the Alpine Advocate was just going to Stell's Styling Salon to get her hair cut.  The last thing she expected was to open the wrong door in the Salon and discover a woman laying on a table with her throat cut.<br />This happens in the first pages of the book.<br />Emma is even more stunned when shop assistant Laurie Marshall tells her the person on the table who was supposed to be getting her facial was Ms. Whitman.<br />Honoria Whitman, who was in a wheelchair after being thrown down the stairs by her abusive husband who was then shot dead by her brother, had been the Sheriff, Milo Dodge's on again / off again girlfriend for almost five years.<br />It was a relief when Emma found out it wasn't Honoria, but Kay Whitman, her sister-in-law who was visiting with her husband Trevor, who had just been released from prison for the killing of Honoria's husband and their mother.<br />But who would want to kill someone who is perfect stranger in Alpine.  And was the fact that she had taken Honoria's appointment at the last minute mean that it was actually Honoria who was targeted?<br />Emma's finds a lot of suspects.

Marv Peteren, bank president seems distracted and some of their customers aren't getting the proper service they're used to receiving.<br />CD's are missing when a customer attempts to cash theirs in, and checks aren't being mailed out for the customers who are using the bill paying services at the bank.<br />And things aren't helped when on an outing with her grandson, Vida Runkel, The Advocates, House and Home editor, stumbles across the body of Marv's daughter, Linda Lindhal, the bank bookkeeper, hidden in a hollow log in the forest.<br />Vida is more upset that finding the body may have done great harm to her sensitve \\"nightmare brat\\" of a grandson, and is determined to help Emma find the killer.<br />Local sheriff, Milo Dodge seems to think that's his job and try as he might, he can't get Emma to stop investigating, which leads her to almost being killed when she comes face to face with the  murderer.<br />Highlights:<br />Emma's phone conversations with her Catholic Priest brother, Ben and her college son, Adam.  Adam's currently in Arizona, going to school, having already been to Universities in Hawaii and Alaska. I think he's working his way backwards through the states, from the 50th, 49th & now in the 48th.  Ben is very funny and reminds me of a priest I used to know.<br />Emma's employee's are becoming more and more involved in the storylines and they're all a hoot.  Vida is involved, the most, but now office manager, Ginny Burmeister and Carla Steinmetz, who has a journalistic degree, but can't seem to spell anything correctly.  Darla Pluckett is probably still upset over the misspelling of her name. (Read Alpine Escape).<br />Both ladies are upset as Ginny's boyfriend Rick is stepping out with the Marv Petersen's granddaughter.  Rick works at the bank and Ginny thinks he's looking to advance his career by going out with his boss's granddaughter.  Carla keeps coming up with the stupidest idea's as to how she should kill herself after the tragic breakup with Dr. Flake, (His name fits him perfectly).<br />Emma's former ad manager, Ed Bronsky, who was left millions from an aunt who considered him to be the happiest and sunniest person in her family. Obviously this woman was crazy.  Ed, who tried to talk everyone out of taking an ad in the paper is now on the town commission and is coming up with idea's as to how to make money and bring in more jobs.  One of his brilliant idea's is to have a contest to see who can solve the murder of Linda Lindhal first. Which is even worse than his idea to force all the town's merchants to put up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving, maybe around Halloween.<br />There is a new ad manager, Leo Fulton Walsh, who Emma met previously (See Alpine Escape).  He's recommended for the job by Tom Cavanaugh.  He's a drunk, and if he was in a real office, would come close to sexual harrassment. Despite that, he's a likeable character.<br />That brings us to the lowlights.  And this is the last time I'm going to mention Tom Cavanaugh in my review unless something drastic happens.<br />Tom Cavanaugh is the father of Emma's twenty-two year old son, Adam.  He married his wife Sandra for her money, which he used to create a publishing empire.  He has an affair with Emma, who worked for him and declares his undying love, however she gets pregnant at the same time as his wife.  (Not only is he cheating on his wife with Emma, but he's cheating on Emma by sleeping with his wife).<br />Tom stays with Sandra, even though she's nuts.  Emma tells him she will raise the baby by herself without any help.  So instead of going to court and establishing his paternity and helping to support and raise his son, he just says \\"OK\\".<br />Now, twenty years later, Tom and his wife had a second child and she's crazier and both kids are messed up, he now wants to establish contact and become Adams' father.<br />I think what irritates me most about this situation is not that Tom is a creep and a jerk, but that Emma, Ben and Vida all think he's wonderful.  A caring guy, who has had a horrible lot in life.<br />I can't decide if the author really believes she's writing a good character or if she just wants us to see Emma with a weakness, but every time Tom's name comes up, I just cringe. And a storyline that started at the end of Alpine Decoy and continues through this book really makes me angry. (I can't say what it is, but if you've read the earlier books, you will probably know.)<br />Emma needs to get the blinders off her eyes, stop living in the past and look around a little.  Milo Dodge is the perfect guy for her.<br />Despite this one glitch in her storyline, I love this series.  Not as good as the bed and breakfast series with Joe & Judith Flynn, but so much better than many other series.both kids are messed up, he now wants to establish contact and become Adams' father. <br />I think what irritates me most about this situation is not that Tom is a creep and a jerk, but that Emma, Ben and Vida all think he's wonderful.

But it comes closer to home when Emma and her brother, Ben, who is a priest on vacation from his parish in Tuba City, Arizona go out to chop down their Christmas tree.<br /><br /> Emma finds her perfect tree and Ben finds another body.<br /><br /> Who are these two women and why did they come all the way to Alpine to be murdered?<br /><br /> Did it have anything to do with the local well to do Nyquist family, who are suddenly being hounded by pranksters, stared at by peeping toms and robbed.<br /><br /> Emma is determined to find out, and with the help of her employee, sixtish Vida Runkel and her brother, Ben, she uncovers a plot which could lead to her solving the crime, or to her own murder.<br /><br /> I enjoyed this book.

If she wasn't wasting so much time on this jerk, she could get together with Milo, who is really the man of her dreams, she just doesn't see it yet. It doesn't help that Ben & Vida both think Tom is wonderful.      This storyline irritates me so much, I've been tempted to go to the last book I have in the series - Alpine Obituary, just to see where this relationship has gone. I'm dreading that she might actually end up married to this creep.       Next in the series - Alpine Decoy.	2004-04-24

All the contests, sales and special events want to advertise in Emma Lord's paper, the Alpine Advocate.<br />Plus, Emma's son, Adam, who has the brains of a turnip has left college in Hawaii and gone to Alaska to work and now wants to go to college in Fairbanks.<br />On top of that small town girl makes good, Dani Marsh is coming home after five years to do location shooting on her new movie, with her new fiancee, movie heart throb Matt Tabor and director Reid Hampton.<br />Dani had run away to Los Angeles after the SIDS death of her baby and divorce from husband Cody Graff.<br />Emma doesn't know much about this story, but gets filled in on the old information from her employee and confidant, sixtyish, Vida Runkel, whose niece Marje is now engaged to Cody Graff.<br />What Emma doesn't understand is why everyone seems to hate Dani, including her own mother. Cody Graff even announces to everyone that he thinks she should be dead.<br />Unfortunately, for him, it's Cody Graff who ends up laying dead on a country road.  Posioned by an overdose of a prescription drug he was taking.<br />Emma is surprised at how many people refuse to believe he was murdered.  Dani, her mother, Patti, Cody's brother Curtis all think he took the overdose himself.<br />But Emma and the local sheriff Milo Dodge believe it was murder and that it had something to do with both Baby Scarlett's death five years ago and then the death of the young deputy, Art Fremstad, who was investigating the baby's death.  It was ruled that he had committed suicide, but Milo had never belived that, and it now looks as though he had also been murdered.<br />Emma was determined to find out the answers, before the killer could kill again.<br />I like several things in this book. Emma is vey likeable.<br />Vida is a hoot, reading about this sixtish year old woman, accidentally entering the wet T-shirt contest at Mugs Ahoy and then going through with it because, afterall, she signed her name to the contract is very funny.<br />I really like Milo Dodge, who gets himself a girlfriend, Honoria Whitman, an artist from California.

Milo is worried that he's going to lose his re-election to his UFO spotting opponant if he doesn't find the killer.<br />She has improved a character who really irritated me in the first book.

Tom is determined now, that he has a looney wife and his two kids are a mess that he wants to become daddy to twentyish Adam.<br />Emma, her brother, a priest who calls from his new parish and Vida all think Tom is a great guy.  He's such a Prince Charming that in his one phone conversation with Emma in this book, he tells her he wants to do things for Adam and then says, &quot;Thanks, Chuck, I'll get back with you in a few days,&quot; before slamming the phone down when his wife comes into the room.<br />Emma needs to be looking at Milo instead of looking into the past.<br />Except for this one problem, I am really enjoying the Alpine books.

US	53076972	RETEDNJQY1KG8	0345376722	289008061	Alpine Advocate: An Emma Lord Mystery	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Slow Beginning But Should Be A Great Series	Having finished reading a \\"so so\\" mystery series,(Can't say which series.)<br />I have now started on Mary Daheim's second series of books. Her B & B Series is my favorite of all mystery series.  I love them and am really looking forward to the Alpine books.<br />The Alpine Advocate is ok.  A slow start, but many series start out slow.  It was good enough to have me starting the second book as soon as I had finished it.<br />Emma Lord, 40ish year old former Seattle reporter was shocked when her fiancee, from twenty years previous died without ever remember to change beneficiary on his insurance policy at Boeing.  With a windfall of a half million dollars, Emma buys two things, The Alpine Advocate, a newspaper in the small town of Alpine at the foot of the Cascade Mountains and a green Jaguar.<br />Emma as been publishing for a year when Mark Doukas, grandson of rich, old Neeny Doukas is murdered at an old boarded up mine on his grandfather's property.  Rumors were that he had found gold.<br />Suspicion falls on another grandson, college student Chris who had just arrived in Alpine after being banished to Hawaii with his late mother, who had enraged her father for marrying someone he didn't approve of.<br />Sheriff Milo Dodge is trying to investigate but Emma keeps popping up asking questions and tracking down clues with her employee Vida.<br />Chris is Emma's son, Adam's college roommate and she doesn't want to believe he could be a killer.  Plus, everyone else is acting suspicious.<br />Phoebe, who has been old Neeny's mistress for years.  Mark's father Simon, who's having an affair.  Marks' brother-in-law, Kent who he had a big fight with the night of the murder.  And almost anyone else.  Mark was not liked by very many people in Alpine.<br />Will Emma solve the crime or will the murderer think she's getting to close and put an end to her?<br />What I like about this book is that I liked so many of the people  Emma is wonderful and so is Vida, a sixtish grandmother, who knows everything and everyone in Alpine and is related to half of them.<br />I liked Emma's sort of, starting to be, maybe but probably not,  romance with Milo Dodge, the sheriff.  She goes out with him, doesn't really enjoy it, finds him a little dull, but is a little put out when he doesn't at least try to make any kind of pass at her.<br />This leads me to what I don't like about the book.<br />Emma has a son, Adam in college in Hawaii, he seems to have the IQ of a turnip.  He was born out of wedlock, the result of an affair, Emma had with married, Tom Cavanaugh, a wealthy publisher.<br />Tom had married a wealthy woman and used her money to become even wealthier.  When Emma and his wife both became pregnant at the same time, he chose to stay with the money instead of Emma and has not helped her at all in Adam's support.<br />1.  Emma keeps saying they were in love.  If they were so much in love, how come his wife ended up pregant at the same time she did.  Wouldn't you at least expect a man who's supposidly madly in love with you not to be sleeping with another woman, even if she's his wife.<br />2.  Tom never supported or acknowledged, Adam.  Emma says she told him, she could take care of the baby herself and didn't need him.  That doesn't justify him not being a man and stepping up to the plate.<br />When he shows up in this book, Emma is still crazy about him. Now he wants to get close to Adam and help him.  Nice, after twenty years and his own kids are a mess and his wife is halfway to a nuthouse.<br />Problem number two is also a man - Ed Bronsky, her advertising salesman at the newspaper.  Ed spends most of his time trying to talk people out of taking ads, to take smaller ads, not to use pictures, in other words, try to make as little money for the paper as possible.<br />A newspaper can live or die on it's advertisement.  Emma says she can't fire Ed because she's too soft hearted.  There's a fine line between soft-hearted and soft-headed and she has definitely crossed over in this case.  I know he's used for the humor value, but it just makes Emma look stupid, if she doesn't want to fire him, move him to another position, and hire a salesman, she could afford the extra person if she got someone who did his job.<br />Even with these problems, I enjoyed the book.  I hope Emma realizes what a loser Tom is and he isn't too involved in future books.  She should look a little closer at Milo, being a small town sheriff doesn't have to be a negative.  Maybe he just needs some one to get him going.<br />I only gave the book 3 stars because I know how much better Mary Daheim can write and I'm sure the series is going to improve a lot more.  The fact that I'm \\"excited\\" that I have 15 more of the books in this series to read, says a lot. The books are currently up to \\"P\\", Alpine Pursuit.<br />I'll be reviewing each as I finish them.ed and she has definitely crossed over in this case.

I really enjoyed this book and as a series, it just keeps getting better and better.<br />Joanne Fluke's books have the best recipe's of any of these books.  I baked three of the recipe's in her first book \\"Chocolate Chip Murder Mystery\\" for the Christmas Party at work and they were a hit.<br />Now, on to the mystery.<br />Hannah Swensen, owner of the Cookie Jar in Lake Eden, Minnesota can't seem to get away from murders.  When her sometimes boyfriend, Norman Rhodes buys an old house, he invites Hannah and her mother, Delores, who owns an antiques store to come out and check out the house furnishings before he has it torn down.<br />Delores is checking out the basement when she accidentally stumbles over the half buried body of the former owner, drug store clerk, Rhonda Scharf.<br />Who would want to kill her?  Everyone wants Hannah to investigate the murder, her mother, Norman and especially her pregnant sister Andrea, who's bored, and wants to help.<br />The only one who doesn't want her help, is boyfriend number two, Mike, a police investigator, whose partner is Andrea's husband, Bill.<br />Will she be able to solve the crime before Mike, or before the killer stops her.<br />Hannah is very funny and I think she's the only female in a mystery series who has two boyfriends.<br />Norman, is a dentist who until now has lived with his mother and who's late father, also a dentist had a very nasty secret that was revealed in the first book.  I always wondered if he was supposed to be a continuing character after the first book, \\"I mean, his name is Norman.\\"  NO OFFENSE TO ANY NORMAN'S OUT THERE. But it isn't the usual name for a guy who's having a serious romantic relationship with the lead character. But he's a wonderful character, sweet and gentle.<br />Mike, is a police detective and is the macho, [attractive] kind of guy.  He's also very likeable.  I'd hate to be Hannah and have to choose between these two.<br />What I like about this series is that it gives you the feeling of family and friends, you like everyone, Hannah, her sisters, Andrea & Michelle, her parter Lisa.  Her & Norman's mothers. Even the poor murder victim, Rhonda who had appeared in an earlier book.<br />Definite Thumbs Up.  Looking forward the Fudge Cupcake Murders.you the feeling of family and friends, you like everyone, Hannah, her sisters, Andrea & Michelle, her parter Lisa.  Her & Norman's mothers.

Although Death Is Semisweet is not as good as her two best books. A Stiff Risotto and Red Beans and Vice.  It is much better than the other books in the series.<br />It's Christmas Time and Heaven Lee - 4 times divorced, once widowed, disbarred lawyer, ex-stripper and current restaurant owner is minding her own business, sitting in a restaurant with her friend Stephanie, discussing chocolate.<br />Suddenly a giant blimp which has been advertising Foster Chocolates fiftieth anniversary is shot down, its pilot killed.<br />Is someone trying to ruin Foster's anniversary or their entire business.  Does Stephanie know anything about it?  Does the fact that she's a member of the Foster Family and her side of the family was cheated out of the business by her uncles, the current owners have anything to do with it.<br />Nobody knows, but Heaven is determined to find out and with the help of her friends, once more leads an investigation into this sweet mystery.<br />What I liked about this book:<br />Heaven has really grown on me.  I disliked her a lot in the first couple of books, but I think her character has mellowed out a little and isn't as irritating.<br />The mystery was interesting without too many characters, which has sometimes been a problem with her books.  So many characters you can't keep them straight and finally just give up.<br />Many humorous parts.  Heaven can be a scream.<br />Great Chocolate Recipes!<br />Things I don't like about the book.<br />I still find no chemistry between Heaven and her twenty years younger boyfriend Hank.  But he's such a nice guy I feel bad dumping on him in every review.<br />My least favorite character is unfortunately in the book.  Heaven's daughter, Iris.  Heaven and Hank are practically shooting sparks off each other compared with the relationship these two have.  Whenever they're together they seem as if they're two strangers instead of mother and daughter.<br />Heaven says how smart her daughter is.  To prove how smart she is, Iris, who grew up with her mother's many bad marriages has taken for a boyfriend, A member of her father's rock band.  (Iris's father is a famous rock star).  This man who is already a grandfather, is also old enough to be Iris's father and is ex-drug addict and alcoholic.  Considering Heaven finds him smoking a joint in her bathroom, I'm not too sure about the ex part.<br />I know this is just the kind of guy an intelligent girl would want to hook up with.<br />The mystery was interesting until the end.  That solution was ridiculous and disappointing.  I think I could have written a better ending.<br />Not enough use of her supporting characters.  Where was Mona.  Where was Chris.  Please, Please bring back Bo Morales.  That is the guy Heaven should get together with. He may also be young enough to be her son, but sparks really flew between them in the two books he was in.<br />This series is in the middle for me.

Someone has stolen their prized crucifix, which the original sisters had brought with them from France hundreds of years before, put thousands of termites on their antique wooden staircase and are generally trying to mess up their celebration.<br />Things can't get worse when at the celebration dinner, Mary's husband Truely is murdered, stabbed with one of Heaven's knives.<br />Is this just one more thing to ruin the sister's celebration or is there something else? Do the nasty letters, Heaven had received at her restaurant have anything to do with it?  Whatever it is, Heaven is determined to find out who killed her friends husband.<br />What I liked about this book is that there are not the dozens of characters that she has in many of her books.  That sometimes made it difficult to follow the storyline.  This one only had a few additional characters and made for a very easy read.<br />The mystery was good, although I did figure out the killer, but it was close to the end of the book so it didn't matter.<br />Heaven is very funny in this book.  The image of her walking into the police station with a dead bird to have them do a match on the bullet that killed it really had me laughing.<br />The only downside to this story is that she doesn't use her reoccuring characters enough.  Except for Murray - who takes over running her restaurant when she's gone, and Hank, her twenty years younger boyfriend, the other characters are hardly heard from at all.<br />And you don't get a clear description of any of the characters.  I'm still not really clear on what Heaven looks like.<br />The amount of profanity in the book has decreased.  I still wouldn't consider this a cozy mystery.ven looks like.   <br />The amount of profanity in the book has decreased.  I still wouldn't consider this a cozy mystery.	2004-02-25

Was it because she was taking kickbacks?  And why would someone who had just arrived in town be given the job of Festival Planner?  Did the theft of priceless paintings and Charlie's Parkers sax have any connection?<br />Heaven and her band of employee's and friends set out to solve the mystery and make sure that the Festival goes off without any more problems.<br />Although I gave this book only 2 stars, it is much better than the other books in the series, although not as good as A Stiff Risotto which I gave 3 stars.<br />I had disliked Heaven in the first books in this series, but she has improved over each book and I now like her more.  This book, however, finally solved a problem for me that I'd been having with the series.  In most books you feel an attachment to the heroine and the continuing characters.  I have never felt this in this series.<br />In this book Heaven makes a casual remark about if high heels were ok with her attire, which were her usual tights & a T-shirt.  I tried to imagine a 45ish woman who ran around in tights & a T-shirt and realized, I don't have a clue as to what Heaven looks like.<br />She has short, spiky red hair and that's it. I realized that there are no descriptions of these people.  Not only, don't I have any kind of image of Heaven but it's the same for all the reoccurring people.  As I thought of the characters, I realized that the only one who brings up an image to me, is her 25ish boyfriend, Hank.<br />I think that may be why the stories are hard to follow at times.  There are always a lot of new characters each book and they're just names, nothing to distinguish them from each other.  I think that's part of reason I found it so hard to get a feel for Heaven and her friends.<br />Even with these problems, this book was good.  I liked the information about the Jazz Festival and the Negro League Baseball Museum.<br />Heaven, once again shows that she has great chemistry with other men, while having none with her boyfriend.  I wish Chris and Joe were more involved in the storyline and I still miss Bo Morales.<br />For the first time, there were recipes that I would like to try in this book.<br />I had received the first 6 books as a Christmas Gift.  This book made me decide, that although I have problems with the stories, I have begun to enjoy Heaven and her friends and the mysteries, so I purchased Death Is Semisweet. I decided this series is good enough that I wanted to finish it out before starting a new series.<br />For people who have not read any of her books, these are not  Cozy Mysteries.

But the third book, \\"A Stiff Risotto\\" was good and I had hoped that it was a turning point and the series and would improve even more.<br />I was wrong again.  Although better than the first two books, it was no where near as good as A Stiff Risotto.<br />4 Times Divorced, Once widowed, disbarred lawyer, former stripper and current resturant owner Heaven Lee is excited when the Artos (Greek for Bread) convention is in town.  All she wants is to get some helpful hints on how to make great bread, but as ususal, death seems to follow her around.<br />I had disliked Heaven in the first two books, but enjoy her a little more.  I really like her supporting cast, when they're in the story.  And that's what's wrong with this one.  Only Murrey, the former New York Times Crime Reporter is in this story.<br />Unfortunately, the character I haven't liked from the previous books, Heaven's 20 year younger boyfriend, Hank has a large part in this book.  These two people have absolutely no chemistry between them.<br />To make things worse, Heaven's daughter, by her rock star second  husband, Iris is added to the cast.  I find Iris unlikeable.  Once again, I think the author is going for excentric instead of a real life person.  Why would a girl, who is supposed to be so intelligent pick for her boyfriend, a former drug addict, old enough to be her father, member of her father's band.  Didn't she learn anything growing up with Heaven as a mother?<br />As with her relationship with Hank, I don't get the feel of any real closeness between Heaven and her daughter.  She says she's upset with her daughter's choice of boyfriend.  She says she's upset that her daughter is going to live in England instead of coming home.  She says she's upset that her daughter might be in danger. She says everything, but there are none of those little touches you have in books that show you that there is a real relationship between people. The fact that Heaven has to keep saying that she cares comes across to me as she doesn't really care that much.  You get those little sparks of chemistry, the humor between her and the supporting characters who work at her restaurant, but not with the character's that she's supposed to love.<br />I learned more about sourdough, wheat, rye and every thing you could possible want to know about bread.  I didn't want to know it.  I felt like I was in high school science class.<br />One improvement.  They have moved the recipes to the front of the chapter instead of just dropping them into the middle of the story.<br />I don't know why the great characters like Murrey, Chris, Joe, Mona - who runs a store that sells everything for cats, are not used more in the stories. And Bo Morales, her best character isn't even in the book.<br />Better than the first two but not as good as the third.  I'm still hopeful on this series.<br />Onward to the Cornbread Killer.

I didn't like the first book in the series, \\"Death By Rhubarb,\\" and absolutely hated the second book, \\" Revenge Of The Barbeque Queens.\\"<br />In my review of \\"Death By Rhubarb\\" I had said that many of these series take awhile to get going and don't show much improvement until the 3rd or 4th book.<br />This is the 3rd book and this book is a great improvement over the first two books.<br />Heaven Lee, owner of Cafe Heaven in Kansas City and two of her employee's Chris Snyder and Joe Long are on their way to Aspen Colorado for the Real Dish Food Festival and the crowning of the Best Chef.<br />Accidents abound and when a body is found Heaven and her trusted employee's try to find out if someone is trying to kill off the competition or kill off the Festival itself.<br />Meanwhile back in Kansas City, Murray, the former New York Times Crime Reporter has been left in charge of Cafe Heaven, with some very funny results.<br />I really enjoyed this book, all the returning characters seem to be more fleshed out and real.  I like the simultaneous storylines of, Heaven in Aspen and Murray in Kansas City.<br />New characters were still a little flat, but much more interesting and easy to remember than characters in the previous books who all seemed to blend together and made the reading very difficult.<br />After being regulated to a couple of lines in the second book, my two favorite characters from the first book, Chris and Murray are both heavily involved in the story.  And even better, the only character I liked from the second book, Gorgeous, Hispanic, Texan barbequer, Bo Morales shows up again with his chuckwagon and mules.<br />I disliked Heaven Lee in the previous books but I like her a little in this one, she's not so eccentric.  I also liked that the relationship between her and her twenty years younger \\"boyfriend\\" Hank was almost nil.  There is just no chemistry in this relationship, although I think she does have great chemistry with a couple of other guys in the book.<br />The recipes are still a problem in this book, they're dropped right in the middle of the page, story just stops, recipe, story starts up again.  I've started the next book and this problem seems to be solved. I know it's probably an editing problem not authors.<br />This is not a cozy mystery because there is too liberal a use of both the \\"F*\\" word and other profanities by both Heaven and other characters.  A lot of sexual innuendo's between the characters.<br />All in all, this was an enjoyable read. It made me look forward to the next book.  Hopefully, the writing will continue to improve and the rating continue to go up.onship, although I think she does have great chemistry with a couple of other guys in the book. <br />The recipes are still a problem in this book, they're dropped right in the middle of the page, story just stops, recipe, story starts up again.

This book was awful.<br />It's the Barbeque World Series and Heaven Lee, former lawyer, stripper and current restaurant owner is not only participating in a charity cook off but is one of the judges in the contest.<br />Things aren't going so good when one of the contestants, the racist, sexist,  aptly named Pigpen Hopkins ends up drowned in a pot of his barbeque sauce.<br />Why would someone want to kill Pigpen?  Was it because he was a raciest, sexist pig, or was someone trying to steal the secret receipe for his barbeque sauce.<br />Since she discovered the body and also hated Pigpen, Heaven decides she better start investigating before the police decide she is as good a suspect as anyone.<br />The problems I had with the first book only seem worse in this one.<br />1.  45ish Heaven Lee - 4 times divorced, 1 widowed disbarred lawyer and former stripper is still very unlikeable, although every man she meets in these books seem to be madly attracted to her.  I think the author is going towards a colorful character but I just find her obnoxious.<br />2.  I don't like her relationship with Hank the 25 year old, young enough to be her son boyfriend.  I don't object to older women and younger men, but in this case I don't see any true feeling on her part towards him.  She constantly talks about having loving feelings towards him, but they don't ring true.  They sound as if she's trying to convince herself and us that she really loves him.<br />3.  TOO MANY CHARACTERS.  This was the main problem in the first book and it's even worse in this one.  The first book had a couple of people that I felt I got to know.  Only one, Murray, the former New York City Crime Reporter, is even in this one to any extent. I finally gave up trying to remember who was who and in the end, it didn't matter.  Although I did like the character of Bo Morales, but how can you not like a gorgeous barbequer who travels in an old fashioned chuck wagon pulled by mules to the contests.<br />4.  The solution to the mystery.  I had to go back and read this section twice, because the solution made no sense to me. It felt tacked on, like the story had been going along and suddenly the writer remembered they had to have a killer and just picked someone out of a hat.<br />I did like the background of the Barbeque Contest, I've watched them on the Food Network and it seemed true to life as to how the contestants get so wrapped up in the events.  Unfortunately, that can not sustain an otherwise uninteresting mystery filled with boring and irritating people.<br />I'm always optomistic and hope that the third book in the series will be better.o Morales, but how can you not like a gorgeous barbequer who travels in an old fashioned chuck wagon pulled by mules to the contests.<br />4.

Although it looks like a cozy mystery, I don't consider it to be one for several reasons, the top three are:<br />1.  The liberal use of the F* word by both the main character and other's in the story.<br />2.  The main character - 4 time divorced - 1 widowed - Heaven Lee, who is about 45 - sleeping with a 25 year old.<br />3.  Heaven Lee - A former stripper and disbarred lawyer who says she was disbarred for \\"doing what all lawyers do, putting together a drug deal for their clients.\\" I'm sure there is a story behind that but it's not told in this book and I think  I think it should have been, because I don't think it casts Heaven in a good light.<br />It's Open-mike night at Cafe Heaven.  Unfortunately, the evening ends early when lawyer, Tasha Arnold drops dead.  Since Tasha is dating and sleeping with two of Heaven's ex-husbands and dies of poisoning after eating dinner at the Cafe, Heaven becomes the top suspect.<br />The problems with this book starts with the fact that I don't like Heaven Lee.  There are so many characters in the book, but they are so undefined that I had a hard time following who they were, and what they were doing.<br />I think the only people that I got to know were Chris, who works at the restaurant and was the victim of gay-bashing hate crime in the past.  Murray - a former New York City Crime reporter and Sandy - a lawyer who is one of Heaven's ex-husbands.<br />All of the other characters, I thought were so lacking in personality that they don't really stick out.<br />Then there's the recipes.  They are flopped right in the middle of the pages. The story just stops for a recipe and then continues after the recipe.  Usually on the same page as the recipe. (I'm sure this is an editing problem and not the author's, but it is irritating.) And I can honestly say I would never try any of these.  For one thing, I don't even know what a Jicama is or what wheatberries are or where to find them.<br />However, the mystery was and characters were just interesting enough that I will read the second book.  I know a lot of mystery series I read seem to have problems with their first book and don't really hit their rhythm until the 3rd or 4th book.<br />With the character's I enjoyed and the mystery which was ok, and a nice surprise killer are enough that I want to go onto the next book and hope for improvements in the future.at wheatberries are or where to find them. <br />However, the mystery was and characters were just interesting enough that I will read the second book.

At the evening reception, Luther Read, head of the Pioneer Press Group is murdered and his son Junior is arrested.<br />Lucy knows Junior isn't guilty because, after all, her daughter Elizabeth is working as a nanny for his little boy during the summer vacation and her daughter couldn't be working for a murderer.<br />Lucy tries to solve the murder, but most of the book seems like a travelogue through Boston.  The descriptions of the Stewart Gardner Museum was interesting, and I like a little scenic flavor in a book, but this was too much.<br />The mystery wasn't all that interesting.  Lucy spends a lot of time walking to different places, shopping and she does talk to a lot of different suspects but I don't think anything she does would have ever led her to figure out who the killer was.<br />I don't consider it solving the mystery when Lucy only figures out who the killer is when she comes face to face with them, after they attempt to kill her.<br />If this is the first Lucy Stone Mystery you've read and you're disappointed in it, don't stop with this one.  Go back and read her earlier books.  They are very enjoyable and you really get to know Lucy and her family.<br />One of the problems with this book is if you haven't read the earlier ones, I think it could be difficult to understand the dynamics of this family.  Lucy spends a lot of time worrying about her kids and husband, which is easier to understand if you know what had happened previously to all the characters.<br />Despite my disappointment in this book, I am looking forward to the next book in the series./>Despite my disappointment in this book, I am looking forward to the next book in the series.	2003-11-26

This book contains four stories - 2 from authors I have previous read and two who were brand new to me.<br />1.  Dial M For Mom - by Mary Daheim.<br />Mary Daheim's Bed & Breakfast Series are my favorite books in mystery series.<br />This story is a continuation from that series, in which Cousin Renie's three children have announced their engagements.  The story is very funny as she tries to plan three weddings, all on the same day, but at different locations without going crazy.  It doesn't help that her photographer is found dead in the parking lot after the wedding rehearsal.<br />Is it murder?  Could it have anything to do with the mysterious man who keeps showing up in pictures that he had taken of the families earlier?<br />2.  Mothers Must Do - by Carolyn Hart. I have read several of Carolyn Hart's books, but none with the character of Laurel Darling Roethke, so I don't know if she has a continuing series with her.<br />I hope not.<br />I didn't like the character of Laurel Darling, from the beginning of the book where she loads up the dead body and moves it so the police won't know where he was killed, to her continuously thinking \\"Dear Max\\" whenever her son's name comes up. And it seems to come up all the time.<br />The mystery wasn't very interesting.  I didn't care about any of the people and couldn't wait for the story to end.<br />3.  The Proof Is In The Patch - by Jane Isenberg -<br />I have never read any of her books before, but I enjoyed this story enough that I will check out more of her books.<br />Bel Barrett is a college professor.  One day she receives an urgent call from a student who needs to see her right away.  Bel puts her off until the next day, which is unfortunate as the student is murdered before they can have their meeting.<br />Bel decides to investigate the girl's murder, which includes taking a job as a nanny at the home where the student had worked and had been murdered.<br />The story had some very funny moments the mystery was interesting and I really liked the character of Bel Barrett.<br />4. Tomcat - by Shirley Rousseau Murphy.  I have never read any of her books before and won't read any in the future.  I couldn't even finish this one.  Maybe you have to be a cat person to enjoy it.<br />The book is a must buy if you're a fan of Mary Daheim as her story is a continuation of a storyline in her books and although you may get bits and pieces in her next book, this will probably be the only place to get a complete look at the weddings of all three of Cousin Renie's kids, and that alone is worth the price of the book.murder, which includes taking a job as a nanny at the home where the student had worked and had been murdered.  <BR>The story had some very funny moments the mystery was interesting and I really liked the character of Bel Barrett. <br />4.

Luckily her cousin Renie comes to the rescue, she has to attend a convention at the Native American Stillasnowamish Casino and invites Judith to come along.<br />Judith, her husband, retired homicide detective and now Private investigator, Joe Flynn, Cousin Renie and her husband Bill, and a nightmare for any vacation, their mothers.  Gertrude who now lives in a converted toolshed at the B&amp;B because she refuses to live in the same house with Judith &amp; &quot;LunkHead&quot; and Renie's mom, Aunt Deb, who still considers her daughter to be about twelve and in need of constant reminders about wearing sweaters and not talking to strangers.<br />What starts out as a semi-peaceful vacation changes quickly when after sitting through the magic show of The Great Mandolini, his beautiful assistant is found dead.<br />The tribal detective Jack Jackrabbit asks for Joe's assitance in solving this case, but not being asked to help doesn't stop Judith from trying to solve the mystery.<br />I don't want to tell much more about the plot, but this latest book has a lot of great twists and turns before it is resolved and I never saw any of it coming.<br />It is a very funny book.  Cousin Renie seems to know everything about gambling and her descriptions of some of the weird slot games she's playing are hilarious.  Her husband Bill seems to spend most of his time observing the games for days before he plays.  He's got a system.  Aunt Deb is a big hit at the convention after she takes her daughters place because Renie can't pull herself away from the casino.  And Gertrude discovers Keno on the TV in her room.<br />I read a lot of these series mysteries and I think this one is the best.<br />If you're a brand new reader, I would suggest you try to read the books in order.  Each book does stand alone as a great mystery, but the relationships of the people evolve over each book, for instance, in the first book, &quot;Just Desserts&quot; Joe &amp; Judith meet up again after 20 years when he comes to investigate a murder at her B&amp;B, how they get back together and why they broke up in the first place and what happened over the intervening 20 years is explained over several books. There are usually references to previous crimes and characters, such as the idiot sheriff from the book &quot;A Fit Of Tempera&quot;, Sheriff Abbott N. Costello who makes a return visit in this book. The author does give you enough information that you know who or what they are without having to have read the previous book.of the people evolve over each book, for instance, in the first book, &quot;Just Desserts&quot; Joe &amp; Judith meet up again after 20 years when he comes to investigate a murder at her B&amp;B, how they get back together and why they broke up in the first place and what happened over the intervening 20 years is explained over several books.

This book I believe is a great improvement over the first two books.<br /><br />Veiled Threats: Carnegie Kincaid is a wedding planner who seems to have a murder along with each of her events. I would think clients would be reluctant to continue coming to her. I knew who the killer was almost from the beginning of the book and the plot was so convoluted I wished everyone had been killed by the end.<br /><br />Died To Match: The second book was a slight improvement in that the mystery was much more interesting, but was ruined by what I thought a not very well thought out killer. Even when the book was over, I didn't believe who the killer was.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I wanted to tackle the third book, but it turned out to be very good. The mystery was interesting, the killer was a complete surprise but fitted in perfectly with the storyline. I love the relationship between Carnegie and Aaron her on again / off again reporter boyfriend. She has some great supporting people, Boris the florist, Her best friend Lily and the hilarious Buckmeister family, whose first appeared in Died to Match and are still planning their daughter's Christmas wedding in this book. The plans for this wedding gives new meaning to the word tacky.<br /><br />Even though I didn't find the first two books to be very good, I think it's important to start with them, because they do give you a real feel of the characters, their backgrounds and explanations as to why they are doing certains things in later books.	2003-10-27

The great thing about this book is it works as a nonfiction book, if you're a believer and as a book of fiction, if you're a nonbeliever.<br />If you believe in UFO's and monsters, the interviews with the people sound very sincere and convincing.<br />If you don't believe in the subject, the book reads like a good horror novel with a tragic ending which is based on a true event	1997-04-15
