Fans of Brian Wildsmith and Meilo So will like these fresh and sometimes funky illustrations. Why don't you buy someone this book instead of a bouquet?

It's beautifully written, and scary as all get-out.  I read it over a year ago, and it still haunts me.  It is a pleasure to read aloud to children in grades 5-8.  What an imaginative use of folklore!  I am not familiar with all of the author's work, but I sure thought this stood on its own and I'm glad it is in print.  Good for fans of Joan Aiken, and for Mordicai Gerstein's new book, The Old Country.	2005-05-03

I have seen a lot of children dragged to lectures and other broccoli-like occasions depicted in this book.  I don't feel this book or this poem is anti-intellectual or out-of-date, in fact, I think it is very timely in view of the current competitive ethos of advancing/preparing children, where we push children to absorb information and to excel academically, but don't always give children the chance to experience and appreciate things on their own terms.  What I do think is anti-intellectual is discouraging an illustrator from interpreting a poem in her own way.  I'm glad Walt Whitman is being presented and celebrated for a new age.  This book is nice presented to young audiences in combination with Walt Whitman:  Words for America by Barbara Kerley.	2005-03-18

When I opened this book, I figured it was just going to be one of those books along the lines of \\"when mommy goes to work, I'm sad until she gets home\\" or \\"I'm sad when I stub my toe,\\" but no, this book isn't about little sad, it's about big, big grown up sad: the author's exploration of his own grief upon losing his son.  When I opened the book to the last wordless page I burst out crying (both times I read it), and initially felt very strongly that this was not a book for children.  But on further reflection, this may very well be a book for some children, and more than that it is a great piece of art: honest and beautiful even though it is very painful to read.  Really, it is the epitome of a marriage between writer and illustrator...the words tell what the pictures can't always say, and the pictures tell what words can't always express.  Anyone who is interested in the power of a book needs to have a look at this one.  And thank you to this team for being so brave...I am very sorry for the author's loss, but grateful for this and other books both he and Quentin Blake have given to the world.	2005-02-23

Ednah New Rider Weber has what so many authors dream of: an authentic and original voice, and it's put to good use here, sharing a recollection of childhood that is hilarious and chilling in turn, and always honest.  This book puts into first person perspective a dark chapter of American history in a way that both chilren and adults can appreciate.  I savored her beautiful language, realistic and lively dialogue and knack for pulling together her chapters like the last threads of a perfectly woven cloth.  I look forward to reading this book aloud to children in grades 4 and up, and I recommend it as a must-read for anyone interested in Native American history or memoir-writing.	2004-11-17

I am *not* Andy Rash's cousin or any relation at all, but I *still* think his latest book is an absolute delight!  I have a professional review posted at [...] but I wanted to say from a personal perspective, when I read this book aloud in the classroom, every turned page was met with laughter, groans of \\"cooool!\\" and plenty of \\"Wow!\\" The artwork is so hip and the rhymes are really creative.  Even though the theme is action-packed, the level of violence stays PG. The spy dance party at the end complete with fedora-wearing record-scratching DJ was a HOOT!  When I was done sharing the book with classes, boys dove after my copy like tigers on a t-bone. This book taps into what kids want to read here and now, with a finger on the pulse of the reluctant reader. It is my own son's new favorite book.  If your family enjoys The Spy Kids movies, Rocky and Bullwinkle or any of the Pink Panther stuff, you've got to add this title to your shelves! I also love Andy Rash's collection of subversive verse _The Robots are Coming_, which has become one of our standard gifts for boys turning eight.

But as far as this goes for a novel, there was just too much stuff in it at once.  First kiss, aging grandma, dead classmate, plus a whole sideline going on about the main character's desire to be a writer that isn't really developed at all, I guess it was just thrown in so the girl can have another connection to Olive.  It's a perfect summer read for pre-teen girls stuck on the beach, which is Martha's deal, but I don't think this book speaks much to boys.  It was a pretty good book, I just wish I could have gone as ga-ga as the readers who recommended it to me and as the reviews I've read.  If it wasn't Kevin Henkes, would it be getting this fanfare?	2003-12-08

When I read it, I wasn't under the impression that it was written to tell other teachers how to teach, it was written to share her experience.  I heard Esme speak in person and she said the diary was unabridged and that she herself knew she didn't come off that well, but if she changed it around it would't be a real diary anymore. She published it to serve as a battle cry to help other teachers value their own anecdotes and start a dialogue about what works and doesn't work in education.   I appreciated the the honesty of the voice, she was either brave or crazy to publish it.  Use this book to look inside one inner-city classroom, and into one teacher's soul.  Those people who criticize this book for not being something that it never proported to be, like Harry Wong's The First Days of School, are unfair.  Don't read this if you are looking for someone to tell you what to do.  Even if you don't find much pretention or insight, you're bound to laugh a lot, and I mean A LOT.

The zany, cartoonish pictures are in the tradition of Seymour Chwast, and I agree with the other reviewer, every time the children look at them they will find some new detail worth marveling over.

Wow, do I disagree with School Library Journal's review where it says this is not a necessary addition to a collection!  Obviously that librarian does not read aloud to children very much! I have shared this title with over sixty schoolchildren and it never fails to elicit cheers.  It goes beyond the moral of \\"slow but sure\\" and extends into the theme of friendship, a subject of interest to every child.  The illustrations are bold and snazzy.  Overall, this book was a real pleasure to share with primary children.

I awaited the release of this book for a long time, and was sorely disappointed.  The book claimed to give information about sibling relationships, and it did talk about birth order, but there was nothing about how compatible the signs were.  The whole organization of the book was clunky, and the passages felt rushed and flippant. I wish more time had been spent on content and really exploring family relationships in terms of the Chinese zodiac.  The topic is compelling but unfortunately it wasn't treated here in a way that gives the reader any real insight.  Save your pennies and spend it on Lori Reed's Complete Book of Chinese Horoscopes (I think it's out of print but still findable), which has info on children's personalities and then some.	2003-01-03

This book is funny and sad, though there were three things that really bugged me:<BR>1.  The main character's love interest.  Why does she like that guy so much just because he went to Harvard?  The character is as shallow as the employer she makes fun of.  <BR>2.  The main character's family.  They aren't poor, and they know she's in a terrible situation.  Why don't they help her?  She's in her last sememster at school.  She describes her family as so supportive but they gave me the creeps.<BR>3.  The main character's willingness to sit through it all.  She's an experienced nanny in Manhattan, the first part of the book even suggests she's come across this breed before.  Yeah, the kid's cute, but why would she get so attached?  It's easy to see where it all will lead.<BR>Still, a genuinely funny read in places, and in many ways an important and disturbing book that hopefully will get many people to reevaluate their priorities.  The speeches at the end are the best!  This book is a good compliment to the sleeper Educating Esme, which is even more funny and better written but deals with the same kinds of problems, only with poor people.  Both are great book club picks, read them together and compare them for some really scary conversation.	2002-05-23

Though I haven't been in the third grade myself in about a quarter century, I still found myself looking forward to finding out what happens next in this true-to-life story about friendship and staying true to yourself.  The lovely line illustrations by Alissa Imre Geis are perfectly suited to the text and really add to the delight of the book.

Bravo to Carol Avery for writing such a wonderful book!  &quot;And With a Light Touch&quot; contains chapter after chapter of helpful ideas that can be implemented in the classroom, but the author also has such an honest and insightful voice, I actually put aside the novel I was reading and looked forward to reading about Avery's adventures in the classroom! Avery books gives a gold standard of value to the often overlooked teacher's anecdote, I wish more folks would share the way she does.   As a mother of a first grader, I was very curious as to what the experience of teaching and learning in the classroom was like, and this book gave me a real inside view.

This book is readable and compelling in parts, but I was completely distracted by the obvious COPYING of the voice of Esther Hirsch using the writing and character of Opal Whiteley, a real life six-year-old diarist from the early 1900's in Oregon who ultimately had her diary published and became famous but is now obscure. Anyone who has read Opal Whiteley's work can see this imitation, and the unusual quality and syntax of Whiteley's diary makes it impossible for me to dismiss this as a coincidence; probably it was in Hesse's subconscious or some kind of writing workshop exercise. It is one thing to write in the style or be inspired by Opal Whiteley's amazing and original voice, but to so clearly emulate it and then not give one dollop of credit really lowers Hesse in my eyes.  If I am wrong, please correct me.	2001-09-13

My son learned to read using Johanna Hurwitz's marvelous Russell/Riverside Kids series, and so we were very excited to begin Pee Wee's Tale. We were not disappointed! The animal story is a nice diversion from Hurwitz's more realistic fiction, but still has all of her markings as an author: humor, empathy and strong characterization. Yes, my son was concerned about the guinea pig's plight, and yes, the release of the guinea pig into the park raised an eyebrow...but it also incited some wonderful discussion about caring for pets and how animals adapt in the wild. Besides being an exciting and provocative chapter book for emergent readers, I think this would make a great classroom read-aloud, and I am giving it as a gift to my son's teacher!

I have read this book to hundreds of first graders and to my own son, and there was nary a complaint of nightmares.  It does portray the food chain and the bitter winter in a dramatic, naturalistic way, but frankly, a fox is likely to eat a mouse and winter is hard on many animals.  The point of the story is that we should look beyond appearances, and that a leopard...and a wolf...can change his stripes; we should give folks a chance to improve themselves.  Even the fox is a vegetarian by the end!<br />Quirky story with a European style that may not to be everybody's taste, but definitely a winner in my neck of the woods!	2001-08-11

I felt so lucky to have a chance to look across time and space into this imtimate view of a girl growing up at the turn of the century, based on a real person.  I  found the use of capitalization absolutely perfect in conveying the not  only the meaning of the text but the emotional impact and the way May  Amelia was internalizing what is being said to her.  The present tense only  made the perceptions more immediate, and I think all together the author's  choices were extremely effective in successfully creating a true time  travel experience for the reader.  There were many characters, boys and  girls, and they all were very distinctive.  I would hate to think any girl  coming of age would miss out on the chance to know May Amelia just because  some people are sticklers for more traditional format, since this book  really lights up the shelves of children's literature and I can't wait to  read it out loud to as many kids as will listen.  To the other reviewer:   yes, Zachary Beaver is terrific, and I do agree that the National Book  Award has promoted some sensational children's literature that surely  rivals the Newbery, but there's no need to read one instead of the other.   Let's be glad there are more forums to recognize the best of the best!    I'll wager time will prove that Our Only May Amelia is among the more  enduring and beloved female protagonists from the turn of OUR century!

As it stands, it is a perfect picture book for older children, with  an especially attractive layout: each double-page spread offering on one  side a two-column anecdote and on the other a brightly-colored, detailed  watercolor.

A great read-aloud and a book children of all ages will enjoy, and grown-ups of all ages will admire.  Deserving of all  possible acclaim, a real diamond on the shelves of children's literature.	1999-12-07

What the Dormouse Said is a terrific resource for anyone who loves children's literature or benefits from a little wisom and wit...and that include everyone!  It is also a great tribute to the writing talents of  children's authors. This attractive little treasure is my gift of choice  for the holidays, I am giving it to teachers and anyone I know who works  with children or is young at heart.  The selections are diverse,  well-organized and just plain fun to read.	1999-10-19

I am a school librarian and this is the best book I read since &quot;Afternoon of the Elves&quot;  about children set apart by  differences.  Even though it was set after WWII, I think it is very timely  in regard to the violent behavior we unfortunately sometimes witness in  children today.  I agree with the previous reader, this author needs more  recognition!	1999-04-15
