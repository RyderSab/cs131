What a coincidence that all previous reviewers gave this book five stars.<br />I find Roiphe's New York Observer column a weird exercise in incoherence. The book is coherent, but still the product of a &quot;writer&quot; whose self-absorption is exceptional.	2003-11-02

Recommended for anyone literate, and essential for Dalmatian owners (Smith wrote &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; and loved the breed).	2003-03-16

It's an interesting book, but the literary part does not outweigh the sci-fi, and there really isn't much said about poker.	2002-11-27

There are at least 20 other poker books I would recommend before it. The problem is that applying the book's concepts is really a very nebulous business.	2002-11-27
