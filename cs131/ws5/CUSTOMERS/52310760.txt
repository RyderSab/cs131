I've read a lot of books, &amp; some were really bad, but this is the worst.  It's so poorly translated that it makes me horribly depressed every time I try to read it.  I haven't finished it yet.

I appreciate the mythic themes of this book, & some of his insights & ponderances, but for the most part it just doesn't feel...important.  For instance, why should I care when this guy writes a poem about a novelist friend of his whom he supports?  Hey I have friends who do things too. & Carl Dennis does do some clever things with rhythms, but I can't believe he's one of the greatest living poets.  How did he wiggle his way so far into the spotlight? Personally I disagree with many of his quasi-logical statements anyways, even while I can appreciate what he's trying to do with them.  I'm glad I got this book to see what's going on in Pulitzer poetry this year, but not because I think the book is too memorable.	2002-12-16

In this book, the art pieces focus on, as the title says, stone.  It's unbelievable.  He just unveils so much magic in the world with his brilliant thinking.  &quot;Otherworldly&quot; is surely the word to describe how much of the art in this book feels.  I keep thinking it couldn't possibly be this planet, but I suppose it's not even a planet anymore; it's the mind of the artist.  Time also plays a significant role in this art.  He builds pieces with the intent to photograph it when the day moves &amp; the light hits it a certain way.  Or he builds things that the incoming tide tears apart.  In a piece I love in this book, he gathered ice from a lake &amp; put it on the shade side of a rock.  The ice gradually melted &amp; was shed.  I wish I could have listened &amp; watched.  Something that adds so wonderfully to this book's beauty made from such simple natural materials is that he also accompanies photographs with very Haiku-like, very poetic, short descriptions of the art pieces &amp; how they existed in time &amp; in the act of his making them.	2002-06-19

I know a lot of people who love Mark Strand, &amp; I know he has done a lot of work for poetry, but he really doesn't seem to me like he's a special poet, hype aside.  I read a lot of poems in this book waiting for them to go somewhere, for Strand to find inspiration, but it never happened.  The poems have a foot nailed to the ground &amp; like it that way, so they can just sit there while other things do stuff.  There are a few good poems, but anyone who writes a lot of poems writes a few that are good.  If this is the kind of writing you want, maybe you would appreciate this guy, but there are so many poets of comparable aesthetic who do it so much better.	2002-06-03

This book starts by telling you about Italian society he was born into, relevant history of the Guelphs &amp; Ghibellines &amp; Italy.  This book also tells us a lot about Dante's personal circumstances &amp; life.  Much of the book, toward the 2nd half, gives a sort of synposis of parts of the Inferno, Purgatorio, &amp; Paradiso.  That part of the book I enjoy less.  It's interesting, but there's very little organisation to it, &amp; I wish more of the book were about Dante's life.

Malevich was one of the most venerable artists of the 20th century for his unflinching avant-garde &amp; geometrical, logical pioneering.  He was known for his Russian futurism &amp; cubism when he conceived Supremetism, geometrical abstraction so named because of the sepremacy of emotion over all other considerations -- &amp; unveiled his new painting, the Black Square.

Volkman writes like no one else, & her writing is rife with great poetic decisions. Her art inspires me with its great vision & boldness. I don't know how unique to me this strong feeling of being able to relate to the thoughts she presents is, but I love it. The book starts with the poem Create Desire, which starts with the line \\"Someone was searching for a form of fire.\\" Is that what life is? That you are someone searching for a form of fire? Later, she ends one of the prose poems with \\"Your turn.\\" She ends one with a string of 3 vowels. She builds one by planting in your mind the suspician that she's addressing a lover, then reveals in the last few words that she is indeed. Her tropes & unexpected word choices are so exciting. One of my favorite syntgactical excerpts from the book is in one of the prose poems when she writes,\\"Plural keeps and cues med, does me dither. Is what is more than mind is -- when I am?\\" -- though that's not much of an example of her troping. Nothing she does in this book feels accidental or not fully thought through; everything feels like a perfect deliberate decision. She is aware of what prose poems do to the weight of words & the pace of the poem. She's very sparing with titles. She uses more regular lines & stanzas when she decides to. Reading this book is like riding a motorcycle with no brakes!  As far as another reviewer's comment that Volkman doesn't give the reader enough information, I think the level of electric metaphor that might be abstruse is a matter of taste.... If you're interested enough in poetry to be considering this book & reading my review, do buy the book; I hope you'll be as pleased as I am.	2002-05-09

So many translations have been done that the goal of this book seems to me not to be to attempt another Inferno of syntax that's become standardised, but to introduce Dante to the world of contemporary poetry by meshing the classic with the eclectic array of poets in this book.  Most actually do seem to want to do a somewhat standardised translation for their canto/s, but new ideas are welcome.

Here, with Never, as she explains in the first poem in the book, Prayer, she gives as much as she can. In Swarm, there were a lot of veils.  Here, she writes often of gold & inlcination.  She also writes about nature by really being in the places in her life she's while writing about them. The strongest place in this book is the beach, as Jorie Graham feels that she's at a critical place between different worlds.  I don't mean in terms of criticism.<br />Listen, watching the complexitry of a bird make song she says, \\"no native immaterial quiver time turns material\\". Jorie Graham, to me, is one of the greatest visionary poets of our time. The poems in this book are the size of her mind & ambition, massive. They resonate with urgency. Each has such deep background in itself. Jorie Graham has said that to stay creative, you have to erase your path behind you as you proceed. Here, she erases the apocalyptic abstractness of Swarm. SHe's now in a very solid world (or at least aware that there's a solid world around her from which abstraction comes). There's much thought devoted to description. She enjambs after articles a lot. She's also almost always on a beach in this book, where the different worlds of ocean & dry sand meet. The sounds, too, are incredible. A very notable poem, for me, is Solitude, which gives in so much to the truth of thought's constant abstractness. That poem is most like Swarm of anything in this book, but the thinking has moved on. The thinking has moved on.<br />With the dismantling of poetry she's done with her 3 books since her Pulitzer Prize-winning selected poems, the severe dismantling, one wonders what she'll do next.	2002-04-10

As a sidenote...is the poem &quot;The Marfa Lights&quot; in this book a hark back to James Tate's poem &quot;Marfa&quot;...?	2002-02-28

I've decided this is usually because of the reviewers, not controversialness of the books.  For me, vthis book has been a very worthwhile read.  It's surely a thoroughly knowledgeable tome.  Mr J does, however, occasionally make some embarassing grammatical mistakesw, &amp; the conclusions he likes to draw based on the facts he presents don't always make sense.  In addition, I'm not always sure about his authority over what he discusses in this book.  For example, in the architecture chapter he discusses a building he calls &quot;Santa Maria Presso Santo Satiro,&quot; but every other source I've read about this building in has called it &quot;...SAN Satiro.&quot;  A small mistake -- a mistake nonetheless.  I can't say how many other small mistakes of his I haven't caught, or haven't thought I've caught.  Anyway, a good book I recommend.  More of an overview to spark more of your curiosity &amp; point you ihn other directions to learn more about, more of an introduction than an end in itself....	2002-02-16

So when she first took up the craft of poetry, this is what she did.  The poetics of the writing are not as difficult as her later work, but the thoughts are still huge concrete slabs of serious intelligence.  It's still difficult, if not in precisely the same way as her later work, &amp; it was clear from this book -- from the first few poems in this book -- that she had gigantic poetry inside her.	2002-01-21

Bei Dao's writing is some of the most pressing, urgent poetry I have ever read.  The man is a great poetic genius.  With lines about such things as the wind closing its iron fist, Bei Dao speaks with power &amp; elegance against repression &amp; of the absolute importance of the individual.  This book is very important.  Bei Dao has made himself a significant man.  Context of human value.  According to Jonathan Spence from the New York Times Book Review, Bei Dao &quot;was obliged to create a new poetic idiom that was simultaneously a protective camouflage and an appropriate vehicle for 'unreality.'&quot;  According to highly respected poet Robert Hass, &quot;[A Bei Dao poem] feels as if it follows the pulse of consciousness, as it moves from metaphor to metaphor, thought to thought, something like a pilot light turned down to the jets and flickers of a single, intense, blue flame.&quot;  Something else that's nice about this book is that it's bilingual, &amp; Bei Dao was active in the translation process.	2002-01-03

The book involves several types of fluid mixing -- mythology &amp; history from her Greek heritage, shamelessly erotic flashes &amp; soft touches, &amp; some well-known western fairy tales &amp; legends.  For me, the climax of her cursive, unique language is in the second-to-last poem of the book, Little Red Riding Hood, in which she describes being born with her &quot;mantle of blood&quot; then elegantly, respectfully minding her mother's advice in life, which is &quot;mind where you got to go, mind you get there,&quot; &amp; a delicious amount of other world-wary stances.  Between that poem &amp; one of the first, Triple Muse, which ends, &quot;We are of one mind, tuning our instruments to ourselves by our triple light,&quot; there is no slackening of vision.	2002-01-03

From her early, formative poetry that showed a remarkable depth, clarity, &amp; potential to the absolute mastery of quasi-formalist poetry to her exploding into true avant-garde where her genius belongs to the Renaissance-immersion &amp; freedom of cultivated uniqueness &amp; finally to her most massive, ambitious writing to that point, she seems to possess a nimbus of poetic exaction that few people can par with &amp; nobody but she could sculpt just how it is.  She constructs, somewhat early on, an infinite loop of enigma &amp; perfect sound, in the poem Salmon.  She examines freedom change, &quot;a new direction, an offshoot, the limb going on elsewhere&quot; with the first poem from _The End of Beauty_, Self-Portrait as the Gesture Between Them.  Then her later works start to get more complex -- more alluring, to some.	2001-11-26

It'ts a struggle for her to come up with the next line.  Doesn't feel especially creative, inspired, or notably intelligent.  I read other disappointed reviews people had written about this book, &amp; bought it anyway.  I tend to have avant-garde sensibilities, so I thought I'd enjoy it for its avant-garde qualities.  I really tried to appreiate the experimentality of it, but I couldn't, because I realised I was readin it more for the sake of reading, &amp; because I enjoy reading,than because this book is any good.  I know a lot of unskilled teenagers who write dada-influenced poetry that's much more interesting than this uninspired book; I don't see what makes Anne Carson so special.  1 star because it's not a good book. 1 more star, bringing the total to 2, because I feel bad just giving it 1 star.  At least she wrote something...	2001-06-30

This is the most terrifying book I've ever read. The poems are all that inelligent. It takes a lot from you to read it, but it gives back much more. She uses her uncompromising, undisputed formal mastery in The End of Beauty to create something necessarily avant-garde, totally unique. Flawless, utterly magnificent in every jerking twist & nuance & flare. The lines explode in myriad different diferent directions like shrapnel, shrapnel, & bring back more scope than you've ever encountered in one place before with sure victory. She knows how to show rather than tell & how to tell when there's the best way.	2001-06-17
US	52310760	R1RK29HIL7836N	0880016957	776082988	Swarm: Poems	Books	5	11	14	N	N	there is only one Jorie Graham	Nobody but Jorie Graham could write poetry this intense, structural, abstract, and do it successfully.  The first aspect of this poetry that one notices is that Jorie Graham has left the standard line/narrative/physical world format almost completely behind, writing a lot of one-line stanzas, and leaving large space between words for the reader to fill.  It doesn't look like standard poetry (well, maybe a poem or two do). The second aspect of the poetry in this book is that she's taken words so far from solid ground and scattered them into the stratosphere.  In this book you will not find any images like salmon swimming upstream...you will find a minimalism of words where possible, attaching to concepts, not anything sensory that's so easy to hold onto.  In Swarm, you're more likely to find lines like &quot;Where definition     first comes upon us     empire&quot; or &quot;Explain inseparable        explain common&quot;.     At first you will not understand the connections between these words, but they are there, and they are vast.  From the first poem to to the last and still reflectng back on it, I've always hoped this book would be remembered in the annals of poetry as the revolutionary book that it is.  Jorie Graham is the poet to start a new poetic era.  Read this book, you'll find her &quot;planting a wildfire in your head&quot;.<br />   And after seeing how people either seem to love this book or hate it according to the reviews here, Swarm is controversial if nothing else.	2001-02-02
