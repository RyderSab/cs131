Instead of making fun of a particular player or incident, Charles Hellman and Robert Tiritilli have taken everyday soccer terms (like \\"nutmeg\\" and \\"forward\\"), and phrases (like \\"soccer patch\\" and \\"here come the subs\\") and turned them into often hilarious comic drawings.  <br /> <br />The humor in these comics comes from knowing what the terms and phrases really mean. If you know what a \\"sweeper\\" is, then the picture of a player with a broom sweeping the ball (sweeper..... get it?) is very funny. One of my personal favorites is a play on the phrase \\"scissors kick\\" (the cartoon has a player whose feet are scissors). The more phrases you know, the funnier the drawings will be to you.  <br /> <br />There are a couple of drawbacks to \\"Soccer,\\" however, which keeps it from winning the World Cup. <br /> <br />First of all, it only takes about 15-20 minutes to read the book from start to finish. At the current price of just under ten dollars, this comes to reading approximately fifty-cents worth of book a minute. There is a sinking feeling that comes over you when you realize you bought a book that could have been read while browsing through the bookstore.  <br /> <br />Second of all, with the exception of the front and back cover, all of the comics are in black-and-white. The covers have great color to them and are so much better, not to mention a little funnier, than their corresponding black-and-white counterparts. As enjoyable as the book is in its current format, it would have been quite a bit better had each of the drawings been in color.  <br /> <br />Despite how funny this comical look at soccer is, I really can't recommend buying this book for yourself. The quick reading time and lack of color drawings will result in a feeling of disappointment when you finish.  <br /> <br />That being said, I think \\"Soccer\\" would make a great gift book to buy for the soccer player in your family. They will thoroughly enjoy the comical look at the sport. And hey.... you can always read it yourself before you wrap it up. They'll never know. <br />	2005-07-02

Originally conceived of as a trilogy, the authors of the \\"Left Behind\\" series realized shortly after they finished the first book that they would not be able to tell the story they wanted in only three books. A trilogy became a four-book series, but not even half-way through this second book, it was obvious that the series would be much more than four books. <br /> <br />As a result, both \\"Tribulation Force\\" and the readers suffer a little for it. Book two had to spend much more time fleshing out the characters than would have otherwise been needed. The story does seem to grind to a short halt a couple of times, but a little patience can overcome it. In the long run, the increased characterization helps both the ending of this book and the series as a whole. <br /> <br />\\"Tribulation Force\\" begins approximately three weeks after the rapture of God's church and continues straight through the 7-year peace treaty signing between the Antichrist and Israel to the beginning of World War III. Along the way we see just how strong the Antichrist's hold on the earth has become and the how far his power does reach. <br /> <br />Though many people will be disappointed at the slow pace and lack of overall suspense of \\"Tribulation Force,\\" those who read it through to the end will have a better appreciation for the entire series as a whole. <br />	2005-07-02

When I was a kid, the first section of the newspaper I would pick up to read was the comics. And beginning in the late 1980s, one of the first strips I would look for everyday (especially on Sunday) was \\"Bloom County.\\" The strip was like no other. Inventive. Original. Funny. Very funny. <br /> <br />Then came along a naive penguin named Opus. Before long, Opus had taken over \\"Bloom County.\\" Eventually, Opus had run for Vice President, played the tuba in a heavy metal band, and took on a cockroach as a pet. <br /> <br />Opus was always my favorite \\"Bloom County\\" character. His antics would often keep my in stitches each day. When the strip ended in 1989, I knew the comics page would never be the same. Although a Sunday only version called \\"Outland\\" started the following month, it just wasn't the same. <br /> <br />Eight years after \\"Outland\\" ended, the Sunday comics got a new shot in the arm when Berkeley returned with \\"Opus.\\" Our favorite penguin was back, and better than ever. Only time will tell if the new strip can match the original, but so far so good. <br /> <br />And now for Opus fans everywhere, Berkeley Breathed has brought together some of his favorite Opus strips from all three cartoons. Included in this collection are introductions by Berkeley to each series, including a small sample of the fake cartoon he drew for the movie \\"Secondhand Lions.\\" Thanks to these fake strips, he decided to get back into drawing and Opus made his return. <br /> <br />This book is a great collection of strips that will take those of us who remember \\"Bloom County\\" and \\"Outland\\" down memory lane. For those of you whose first introduction to Opus was the Sunday comic of the same name, this book will show you the transformation that our favorite penguin has gone through over the years. <br /> <br />\\"Opus\\" is a very funny book that you will enjoy reading again and again.	2005-06-26

In a single moment, hundreds of millions of people all over the world suddenly disappear. Chaos reigns over most of the world. Planes that no longer have pilots come crashing down. Cars that no longer have drivers crash into each other. Mother's in the process of giving birth are suddenly barren. Captain Rayford Steele, piloting a transatlantic flight when the vanishings occur, immediately knows what has happened. His wife talked about it all the time, but he didn't listen. He saw no reason to listen. Now he is going to wish he had. <br /> <br />After the rapture, Captain Steele, his daughter Chloe, his wife's former faux-pastor Bruce Barnes, and international journalistic star Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams are all looking for answers to what has happened. Does an up-and-coming, slick-as-silk politician named Nicolae Carpathia have the answers everyone is looking for? The world sure thinks so. But the answers to the question were actually written thousands of years ago. Will they find the right answers in time? <br /> <br />\\"Left Behind\\" is an extremely engaging working of fictions that is based on the Bible, especially the \\"Book of Revelations.\\" From the moment you start reading, you will not want to put it down. Each chapter makes you hungry to read more. As much as you might want to keep your distance, you will find yourself attached to all the characters. You will keep coming back to read more of the book because you want o know what happens. <br /> <br />This is the first book in what was originally meant to be a trilogy, but ended up being expanded to twelve books. The \\"Left Behind series has become one of the most popular book series of all time, spawning no less than 2 spin-off series and a prequel series. While many non-Christians may take offense to some of the portrayals in the book, many others will find this book to be captivating and engaging. <br />	2005-05-06

The Bathroom Readers' Institute took over the publishing duties of their books beginning with the 5th edition. For reasons known only to them, the BRI only did one printing each of the 5th, 6th, and 7th editions. Even as they continued to print new editions, and even reprint those later editions, they never did anything about these three editions. <br /> <br />Finally, the BRI decided to reprint the \\"lost\\" editions as one giant book. According to the preface, they even updated some of the \\"stories\\" in the book. Unfortunately, they should have also updated some of the many misspellings and other grammatical errors that plagued these editions. <br /> <br />Personally, I would have prefered for the BRI to re-issue each of these editions individually. But something is better than nothing, which makes this combined book one serious bathroom reader.	2004-10-10

Ted Dekker has proven time and time again that he can write a story that will capture and captivate us from start to finish. This first book of his new triology is no exception.      When we first meet Thomas Hunter, he is on the run from some hitmen. It seems that he borrowed some money from the mob and never quite managed to pay them back. A bullet grazes Thomas' head and he is knocked unconcious.      As Thomas regains conciousness, he finds that he has no memory of who he is or even where he is. He touches his throbbing head and finds that it is bleeding. There is also some blood on the rocks where his head was. He thinks he must have fallen and knocked himself out. Unfortunately, Thomas is in the middle of the Black Forest, which is filled with thousands of big, ugly, black bats. When one of them bares his yellow fangs at the confused man, Thomas passes out.      When Thomas comes to, he finds himself face down in a pile of garbage. He manages to make his way to his sister's apartment. After cleaning himself up a little, he passes out on the couch from sheer exhaustion.      As Thomas wakes up, he finds himself surrounded once again by the big, ugly, black bats. Worse yet, he still has no idea who he is or where he is.      Thomas Hunter is trapped between two realities. Everytime he falls asleep or goes unconcious in one of them, he wakes up in the other. But these realities seem more like dreams to Thomas. And to make matters worse, he doesn't know which one is the dream and which one is real.      Unfortunately, both realities are in grave danger. And Thomas is the only one who can save both worlds. But before he can do that, he must accept the reality of both worlds. If he doesn't, neither reality stands a chance of surviving.      At the time of this writing, the first two books of this trilogy (&quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;) have already been released this year. The final book (&quot;White&quot;) is to be released later this year. Ted Dekker has shown us before how he can blindside his readers with plot twists and turns that no one saw coming. So far, this trilogy is off to a very twisty start.	2004-07-31

In 1950, Charlie Brown debut in 7 newspapers. In 2000, Charles Schulz (Sparky) released &quot;Peanuts a Golden Celebration&quot; to honor the comic strip's 50 years.<br />This compilation is one of the best ever created. First and foremost is the selection of comic strips from the past 5 decades that are included. It is amazing to read through these strips to see not only how much Charlie Brown and the gang have changed over the years, but also how much the same they are as well. Strips that were created in the 50s and 60s are as relevant today as they were back then.<br />In addition to the strips, this compilation also includes background information on Sparky, along with his insights on how certain stories came to be and why he drew some of the things he did. There are several pages of letters, tributes, and other information included, making this one of the most exhaustive compilations ever seen in the comic strip world.<br />If you have ever been a fan of Charlie Brown or even remotely interested in some of what went through Sparky's mind when creating these characters, this is the book for you.	2004-01-06

Doug Turner lives on the other end of Tenth Street. Ronnie works at a \\"gentlemen's club\\" while Doug lives in an upscale housing subdivision. Two ends of the same street, yet worlds apart.<br />When the two ends of Tenth Street collide, Doug and Ronnie will have to fight for their lives. But the fight isn't just against human attackers. Spiritual enemies are out for blood as well, and they have their sights set on spilling Doug's and Ronnie's blood.<br />Shaunti Feldhahn has done what few authors are able to do: she has written two stories, each of which could have sustained a book on its own, and woven them together into one of the most compelling stories of the year.<br />The first story is about sexual addiction and how it affects family, friends, and the church. This book may be written by a female, but the addiction point-of-view is from a male. As noted at the end of the book, Shaunti did plenty of research and interviews before attempting to write this part of the story. Chances are many men will see some of Doug in their lives.<br />The second story is the novel part of the book, which involves Ronnie and her job at the gentlemen's club. Unfortunately the club is just a cover for a terrorist organization. This organization uses a clueless Ronnie, and other stage girls, to help them blackmail top managers and officers of companies (including Doug) into unknowingly preparing for the biggest terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil. When Ronnie finds out that there is more to the club than meets the eye, she will have to run for her life. Her flight will land her on Doug's doorstep. Now they both must stay alive long enough to hand the FBI the evidence needed to stop this terrorist organization.<br />Many people will probably be turned off by the first half of the book, which methodically follows Doug stumble into pornography and his slow rise back onto God's path. But there is a lot of truth to this tale. And the reward for reading through this truthful fiction is an exciting conclusion that will make it difficult for you to put the book down.	2003-12-30

This companion book contains many interesting behind-the-scenes facts and was, overall, very enjoyable to read.<br />The disappointment I have with the book comes from the many errors I saw in the episode summaries. You would think that these summaries would be the easiest part of the book to write. Just watch the episode and then write the summary. It appears that whoever wrote these summaries did so from memory. Unfortunatley, that memory seems to be slipping.<br />One example is the summary for the &quot;Star Trek Nemesis&quot; movie. The summary makes it seem like Captain Picard does not realize that it is Data who has freed him from the lab on Shinzon's ship until after they leave the lab (supposedly he thinks he is being taken by B-4 to Shizon). However, Picard realizes that it is Data while still in the lab when Data renders the guard in the lab unconscious.<br />In addition to inaccurate summaries, there were also summaries that, while technically accurate, failed to completely describe the episode. In other words, they were too short. &quot;Deja Q&quot; is an example of this. There was quite a bit that happened in this episode, but the summary makes it appear that this was nothing more than a simple, basic show.<br />Although there was a lot more that could have been done to make this companion book better, it is still one of the best one out there for the TNG series.	2003-11-25

I have never seen so many bad reviews for any of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books. But a good many people have taken the authors to task for this book.<br />And I almost understand why they have. Unlike all 10 of the previous books, &quot;Armageddon&quot; did not capture me from the very beginning. There were many times during the course of reading the first half of the book that I wanted nothing more than for it to end.<br />However, about halfway through the book my attention was finally captured and I was hooked for the remainder of the book.<br />&quot;Armageddon&quot; begins where &quot;The Remnant&quot; left off, with New Babylon in total darkness. As Nicolae Carpathia prepares to move the upper levels of his one-world government out of New Babylon, the main Tribulation Force safe house in San Diego is in danger of being discovered, forcing the occupants to quickly flee to Petra and the safety the Lord provides there. Unfortunately, the relocation comes at the cost of Tribulation Force lives.<br />As the battle of the ages begins, more Tribulation Force members will lose their lives, and another will be hanging to his life, literally. The final couple of days before Christ's Glorious Appearing will be radically altered for those who are left behind.<br />And for those of you who are ready for the next (12th) book to be the last one in the series, I've got bad news for you. Several Christian news sources are reporting that the authors have decided to add a 13th book to the series, supposedly covering the final war between good and evil that will take place at the end of Christ's 1000-year reign on earth.<br />I'll be looking forward to it.	2003-08-01

I first became aware of Randy Alcorn through his tremendous fiction book &quot;Lord Foulgrin's Letters&quot; (another &quot;must have&quot; book). When it came time for me to buy some more Christian fiction books, &quot;Deadline&quot; was one of the first ones I bought.<br />&quot;Deadline&quot; is like no Christian book I have ever read. Instead of just telling us a fictional story about fictional characters, Randy Alcorn has also included a glimpse into what scripture says Heaven will be like (yes, the scenes themselves are ficitonal in nature, but they are based on scriptures). Instead of waiting until the end of the book to share a few words about God to the readers, Randy Alcorn has incorporated the sermon into the story. While this will turn a lot of readers off, it makes for a very engrossing story.<br />If you like Christian fiction books that will challenge you to think, then this is a great book for you.	2003-07-28

Jason Perry became an adult while with the very popular Christian boy band Plus One (he left the group at the end of 2002). Once you read this book, you will realize that he also grew up spiritually as well.<br />Think of \\"You Are Not Your Own: Living Loud For God\\" as an autobiography of Jason's walk with the Lord. Although it is a very short book (only 127 pages), Jason has bared his soul to us completely. He not only shares the good, but the bad as well. Many people, especially those who grew up in the church, should be able to relate to Jason.<br />God has worked wonders in Jason's heart, which will become very obvious to you as you read the book. Though written for an audience his age and younger, even those like me who are (much) older will be touched by Jason's openness and honesty.<br />Thank you, Jason, for listening to the Lord and sharing with us. I have been truly blessed by it.	2003-07-21

There was no interest on my end to really read these books. The &quot;Left Behind&quot; series changed all of that. I have found reading to be very enjoyable and now look for great Christian fiction to read.<br />The first book I opted to read was &quot;Thr3e&quot; by Ted Dekker. Having never heard of him before, I did not know what to expect. But the book cover looked like it would be a good read, and it most certainly was.<br />The book centers around Kevin Parsons, a 28 year old seminary student who has spent the last 5 years trying to put the past behind him. And just when he thinks he has, someone from that very past comes back to haunt him. But this mysterious person doesn't want Kevin to just merely relive it, he wants Kevin to confess it. But of everything from Kevin's past, he doesn't know what it is that this lunatic wants him to confess. Naturally, the fact that this madman has a bad tendency to blow things up when Kevin either can't solve his riddles or gets the cops involved doesn't really help Kevin's concentration much.<br />There are very few places in this book where you can safely put the book down for awhile. Once you begin, the suspense will reel you in. Ted Dekker gracefully takes you for a ride that has more hills, loops, and corkscrews than the local amusement park.<br />If you have never heard of Ted Dekker, like me, &quot;Thr3e&quot; is a great book to get to know him with.	2003-06-28

There are around 1 million people at a place called Petra. God has led these people there and promised them safety, food, and water. In addition, He has also promised them that their clothes will never have to be cleaned, repaired, or replaced. Which is a good thing since I'm sure more than one of them soiled themselves as they looked at two huge bombs dropping down on top of them!<br />&quot;The Remnant&quot; picks up where Desecration left off, and proceeds to steamroll ahead. Unlike the last few books, where the books only covered a very short time span, this book starts at month 43 and continues until month 72 (6 years) of the Tribulation. This should please the many people who had begun to feel like the series was dragging on way too long (however, I have been a fan of all the books, whether they covered two years or two days).<br />Nicolae Carpathia has a blood-thirst that just cannot be quenched. No matter how many people he kills or has killed, it's not enough for him. He wants more. Unfortunately those pesky little Bowl judgments keep throwing kinks into his plan. To make matters worse, even those who have taken the mark of loyalty (otherwise known as the mark of the beast) are regretting having done so. Many of them realize who they have pledged themselves to, as well as the fact that they cannot undo what they have done. Even those who don't see Carpathia as the anti-Christ tire of his rule and have begun to openly disobey.<br />If you were put off be the previous three books, this book should be enough to bring you back into the fold. The writing is better than it has been, all of the characters, both new and old, are flushed out a little more, and the suspense from one chapter to the next is still there.	2003-06-24

The book opens with Rayford Steele and the other Tribulation Force members preparing to evacuate the Jewish believers to Petra and ends with a cliffhanger that will make you want to scream. In between, we see the death of several more Trib (and semi-Trib) members, the coming of age (so to speak) of Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, the revealing of the safe house in Chicago, and Tsion Ben-Judah arriving in Petra.<br />As with most of the other books, the action is fast paced and the characters will draw you in.

From the moment I started reading it, I did not want to put this book down.<br />Lord Foulgrin is a upper-level manager in charge of a few demons, including the demon who has been assigned to Jordan Fletcher, Squaltaint. Lord Foulgrin has written letters to Squaltaint, instructing him on how best to keep Fletcher firmly in their service and not the Enemy's (God) serivce. These letters have now fallen into human hands and have been put together in this book for all to read.<br />Based on C.S. Lewis' popular &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; book, there are two major differences. First, this book is nowhere near as difficult to read as STL was. Secondly, before we read each letter we are treated to a snippet of the life of Jordan Fletcher and his family. This make for a much more entertaining and compelling book.<br />As you read this book, you will find many similarities between your life and Jordan Fletcher's life. In addition, you will often feel like the letters from Lord Foulgrin are about your own life. The letters will make you think and review your own life to see how the demonic enemies have directed you off the path.<br />One of the best fiction books of all times, you should have it as part of your collection.	2003-03-29

The time frame in this one is only three days, from just after Carpathia was killed to just after Satan takes possession of him.

In 1978, United Feature Syndicate gave the go ahead to Jim Davis to do a cartoon strip about a fat, lazy cat who would rather eat and sleep than do just about anything else. Now, 25 years later, this cat would still rather eat and sleep than do just about anything else. At least some things in this world never change.<br />Garfield has been making grown-ups and children laugh for almost 25 years. This comic strip is one of the most widely distributed comic strips in the world. And in this book, \\"The 1st Garfield Treasury\\" you can see how it all began.<br />The Garfield of today does not much resemble the Garfield of 1978, looks wise that is. I had forgotten how different he looked back then. But his charm, or lack of it, is still there in all of its glory.<br />This book takes us through the first two years of Sunday comic strips, from 6/25/78 to 7/13/80. If you grew up with Garfield as a kid, and even if you did not, the \\"1st Garfield Treasury\\" will be a wonderful look back at how it all began.	2003-02-27

Unfortunately, Satan is inhabiting him directly. Which means that things can only go downhill from here.<br />Wanting to cement his power as quickly as possible, Nicolae Carpathia (Satan) orders that every human being accept a mark (an implanted biochip along with a tatooed sign) that will soon be used to conduct standard trade and commerce. Those without the mark will be unable to buy or sell anywhere. Worse yet, anyone who refuses the mark will be put to death by a contraption called a \\"loyalty enforcement facilitator,\\" otherwise known as a guillotine.<br />As the Global Community prepares to start applying the mark, Carpathia also begins to plan a trip to the holy temple in Jerusalem and declare himself God. Being the ultimate egotistical maniac, Carpathia/Satan believes that he will be most welcomed by all. It is his belief that the few Judah-ites that show up will be those that are ready to pledge themselves to him.<br />Naturally, the Tribulation Force sees just the opposite. As the New Babylon members of the Tribulation Force prepare to flee before being made to choose between the mark and death, the stateside members prepare to head oversees to throw as much of a monkey wrench into Carpathia's plans as possible.<br />The 8th book of the popular \\"Left Behind\\" series, \\"The Mark\\" is not as suspenseful or grabbing as most of the previous books have been. This is more of a transition book, going from the Tribulation to the Great Tribulation. Much of the old has to be cleared out to make room for the new, so time is needed to introduce new characters and set the stage for what's next to come.<br />That being said, the description of the beginning of the mark application in a prison in Greece is very graphic and disturbing. This section is not easy to read and, if you are a Christian, will make you very happy that you will already be up in heaven when the time comes for this to take place.	2003-02-20

After two postponements due to the Trumpet judgements, the time has arrived for Tsion Ben-Judah and the 144,000 witnesses to meet in Jerusalem. Buck and Chloe Williams, members of the stateside Tribulation Force, are there as well to protect Tsion. For some reason, they just don't trust Nicolae Carpathia's pledge of safety (go figure!).<br />Captain Rayford Steele, desparate to find out the truth about his second wife, the late Amanda Steele, plans to meet his daughter and son-in-law in Jerusalem. They know the truth about her, but will only talk about it in person. Unfortunately, Rayford learns that if he goes to Jerusalem, he will be killed on the spot.<br />However, Rayford is not the only one in danger. After the two witnesses show Nicolae Carpathia up at the meeting of the witnesses, Carpathia orders the Tribulation Force destroyed as soon as the last meeting is over. During the mad dash to safety, one Tribulation Force member will be killed and another stranded in Israel, a wanted and hunted man.<br />Soon after, the fourth Trumpet judgment occurs, plunging the world into darkness (1/3 less sunlight) and cold (1/3 less intensity). This latest judgment reaks havoc on the world's energy supply, especially solar power.<br />Then it's time for the fifth Trumpet judgment. Demonic locusts, ordered by God to only attack non-believers, descend on the earth. As in unison, these ugly creatures call out to their master: Apollyon.<br />This is the 5th book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series. Instead of becoming stale and repititive, as can happen in many book series like this one, \\"Apollyon\\" grabs your attention and holds on tight. This is one book you will have trouble being able to put down until you have finished it.	2003-02-12

The halfway point of the peace treaty between Carpathia and Jerusalem is nearing, and all hell is about to break loose. Literally.<br />As the book opens, we find that it's all Rayford Steele can do to keep his rage, no...make that murderous rage, inside him. He wants to be the one to kill Nicolae Carpathia no matter what the cost. And he's willing to do just about anything to make sure that happens.<br />Nicolae Carpathia, on the other hand, is preparing a global gala in Jerusalem. Not because he really wants to have a party. His main purpose is to kill the two witnesses at the wailing wall. He has pinpointed the exact time they will become vulnerable and wants the credit of doing them in. In front of a worldwide audience, no less.<br />However, Carpathia appears to be ignorant of the fact that his own time is near as well. He will not make it out of this global gala alive. The question is, who will be the one to kill him?<br />Rayford Steele, who has purchased a new gun just for that reason? Hattie Durham, who blames Carpathia for all the horrible things she did during their time together (not to mention the fact that he killed their unborn baby and tried to kill her). Mac McCullum, who fantasizes about flying the Pheonix 216 into a mountainside with Carpathia in it? Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, who seems to work night and day in his workshop on a project that he won't reveal to his own housestaff? You get the idea.<br />\\"Assassins,\\" the 6th book in the popular \\"Left Behind\\" series is, without question, the most suspensful book in the series so far. Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins use the entire book to set up the explosive finale. The suspense is so thick by the time Carpathia gets his just reward that you could cut it with a knife. But it doesn't stop there. A cliffhanger ending will make you want to throw the book out the window in complete frustration. Assuming you forgive the authors for that dirty little trick, you will immediately want to start in on the next book. After all, you just have to know what happens next.	2003-02-12

Lewis's &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is a compelling, and chilling, fictional look at what goes on behind our back in the demonic spirit world.<br />Screwtape, an upper level demonic spirit, often writes his subordinate, Wormwood, a demonic spirit assigned to misguide and misdirect a human on earth. The letters explain to Wormwood how he would best accomplish his mission of keeping the human our of the Enemy's (God's) hands and ensure that when he dies he goes straight to blazes.<br />What is most chilling about &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; is that, even after all of these years, how much a person can see of themselves in them. Letter after letter seemed to be talking about me directly. Time and time again I saw one demonic trap after another I had fallen into being explained in a letter.<br />I have to caution you, however. This book is not an easy read. C. S. Lewis did not attempt to write a book that everybody could understand. You will probably have to spend some time re-reading many letters and looking up words in your dictionary and/or concordance for a better understanding of what is being said. This can become quite frustrating, but when you are able to break through and understand a letter you will be able to see how it can apply to your own life.<br />If you were ever interested in getting a better understanding of how the Enemy and his demonic spirits work, this is a great book to do it with. But be warned: you will learn something about yourself in the process.	2003-02-08

Death and destruction are everywhere. And many of those that are still living want nothing more than to die. New Hope Village Church is gone. Loretta's house is gone. Global Community Weekly is gone.

Tsion Ben-Judah, despite being a marked man by the Global Community, wants to return to Israel to rally together the 144,000 Jewish witnesses. The pressure is on around the world to force Nicolae Carpathia into providing protection for Tsion's return. Will Carpathia give in to the pressure and let Tsion return?

Even now, years after she passed way, her writings are still funny and topical.<br />In &quot;I Lost Everything in the Post-Natal Depression,&quot; as with most of her books, Erma Bombeck takes snippets of her life, her husband, and her three kids and relates them to us in a way that only she can. Everything from her husband's inability to start a fire in the fireplace to her own inability to cope with turning 40, nothing is sacred or forbidden when Erma writes about her life.<br />This book is funny, witty, relevant, and an easy read. If you're life is busy and complicated, take some time out to read this book. Erma has a way of making your life seem not so bad. If nothing else, it's a great way to spend a few minutes each day.	2003-01-28

It has been 18 months since the seven-year peace treaty was signed between Israel and what was the United Nations. New Babylon has emerged as the new center of the world, housing the Global Community. The people who were left behind after the massive disappearances have moved on with their lives. And so has the Tribulation Force. But all good things must come to an end....<br />World War III has broken out all over the world except for in Israel. Of course, Global Community Grand Potentate Nicolae Carpathia is responsible for most of it. Long after the insurrectionists have been neutralized, Carpathia continues to destroy city after city all over the world while convincing the world that the insurrecitonists are the ones responsible.<br />Most of this third edition of the \\"Left Behind\\" series deals with the aftermath of WW3 and the rescue of Tsion Ben-Judah from Israel after the brutal murder of his family. While the first two books spent more time developing the characters, which alienated some people, this book grabs your attention quickly and never lets go. The action is fast paced and constant. No sooner than the Tribulation Force has dealt with the second seal being broken (WW3), they then have to deal with the third and fourth seals (plague, famine, death). And just when they finally have time to catch their breath, the sixth seal, the wrath of the Lamb, is broken.<br />If book two turned you off, then \\"Nicolae\\" should be enough to bring you back to the series.	2002-12-22

Since the dates have not been left in the strips, it is difficult to determine the time frame involved. But that doesn't really matter, because this strip is as fresh and funny today, years after Bill Watterson ended the strip, as it was back in the day.<br />If you have never heard of Calvin and his adventures with his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, pick this book up today and become hooked with the rest of us.	2002-12-14

And Dilbert certainly has several of those. But this time around, Scott Adams has created a decade long compilation.<br />Instead of presenting the strips in chronological order, which is normally the way it's done, Scott Adams has broken this book into 39 categories contained in two sections. Some of the categories include \\"Bosses,\\" \\"Safety,\\" \\"Lawyers,\\" and \\"Marketing\\" to just name a few. And each category contains daily and/or Sunday strips from 1990 - 1999 that pertain to the category.<br />In addition to the way the book is broken down, it is interesting to see the strip from different years. It wasn't until about 1995 that the characters in the strip evolved into what we see today. Before that, Dilbert had a much longer face, Alice did not have the poofy hair, and the pointy-haired boss wasn't quite so pointy-haired.	2002-11-14

We all have one or more family members that resemble the characters in the FoxTrot comic strip.

It starts with the dad, Roger, buying a Mobycom-2000 cell phone (think Titanic), and ends with Peter being disappointed with his Physics Lab. In between, the family gets their new \\"iFruit\\" computer (mango-kiwi, thank you), Roger goes a day without coffee (not a pretty sight), Paige fills her aquarium before taking it upstairs, and Jason kills off the Internet (makes the \\"I Love You\\" virus look like the sniffles).	2002-11-14

His best friend, Hobbes, the aforementioned stuffed tiger that comes to life when only Calvin is around, proves the old axiom \\"you can take the tiger out of the jungle but you can't take the jungle out of the tiger.\\" Don't look now, but I think Hobbes is about to pounce on poor Calvin once again.<br />This book is a collection of daily and Sunday \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" comic strips from the early 90s. It proves, and reminds us, of just how much we miss this strip in our lives each day. Most \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" fans believe that Bill Watterson ended the strip well before its time. But both Calvin and Hobbes will live on forever through the various collection books like this oen.	2002-11-14

Instead of reading the latest issue of Reader's Digest, why not learn a bunch of interesting and funny, if not just downright useless, facts?<br />The third edition of the popular Uncle John's Bathroom Reader brings you more (and more and more and more) of interesting tidbits and stories to help you pass the time. From a list of film terms (an oater is a western) to an inside look at the musical television group The Monkees, this book has a seemingly never ending supply of information to pass along to you. There's even an entire story about the origins of toilet paper (i.e. the Sears catalog).<br />There is one warning that should be mentioned here: This 3rd edition is full of spelling and grammatical word errors. Though it doesn't change how much fun this book is to read (and use), it is kind of disappointing to see so many mistakes.	2002-10-26
